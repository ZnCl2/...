				"body": "@0x1409u4n\n\nI've posted more in chat about it:\n\nIt sends and receives data from demo.zeronet.com, see source code of ZeroBoard and ZeroID. \nExample from ZeroBoard:\n return $.post(\"https://demo.zeronet.io/ZeroID/solution.php\", {\n return $.post(\"https://demo.zeronet.io/ZeroID/request.php\", {\nI have added what to do in both cases, see S001 + S002 under \"specific sites\" in: http://127.0.0.1:43110/Zerosecurity.bit\n\nConsequences:\n1. If demo.zeronet.com is blocked/unavailable: \na. ZeroBoard posting does not work \nb. but you can read what others write there\n\n2. zeroid will still work, since the demo.zeronet.com is used for web registration. Afterwards your ID is saved in the ZeroNet data dir.\n\nthe problem is this: \n1. user is not told about outside access. \n2. since Edward Snowden we know that organizations sniff the web, I assume in China this is more aware then here in the Western world (e.g. your own government spying, ...)\n\nThe most important AND easy thing to protect yourself is this: http://127.0.0.1:43110/zeroblog.bit/?Post:60:protect+yourselves:+set+a+non-working+proxy",
