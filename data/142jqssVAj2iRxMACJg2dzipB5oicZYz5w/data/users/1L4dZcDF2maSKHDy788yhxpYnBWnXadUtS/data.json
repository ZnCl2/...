How these two differ? Knowledgebase not explain this.",

			"title": "Idea on a new site: create galleries/playlists out of other zites multimedia files",
			"body": "Hello, i am not a developer and here is an idea **what kind of zite i am missing there**.\nThe **zite that would allow users to create collections of favorite zeronet hosted multimedia**\n\nFor example i create playlist called Favorite pop music and there will be text area where i can input zeronet URLs to a mp4, mp3 files and submit them (unsure if the site can search all my optional files and use it to to import such URLs). Then i can easily play and loop this whole playlist. The site would ask me to Grant permission to external sites to get requested files - same as for example [ZeroBlog++](19fZJhX7FGENeRRLB8ftgrziBJ5vsLtFog) does it for externaly linked images (for example). (i do not like how zeronet handle cross-site linking, similar [github issue](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues/1992))\n\nAlso the site can allow me to create image galleries where images are linked from external zites. I can then share the link to my playlists/galleries with other zeronet users and  they can bookmark it on the site so they can also in the future quickly access it.\n\nUsers can easily rename and move their favorite galleries/playlists into subcategories.\n\nSite may support search to quickly get into matching named gallery or the particular multimedia file.",
