It doesn't change for other zites because that's dependent on the creators of those zites.\n\nThank u for ur kind explanation. ZeroTalk is also affected. (because @nofish owns it?)",

For example, if I switch the language from `en` to `zh`, ZeroTalk main page title is converted from `Newest topics` to `最新的话题` including other menus such as `+ Start new topic` and so on, everything.",

So it only works for some languages.\n\nOh, in case of `DE`, ZeroTalk/languages/ folder doesn't have `de.json` file. :p\n\nThere're da, fr, hu, it, pl, sk, uk, zh-tw, zh.\n\nHow can I add `ko.json`?",
