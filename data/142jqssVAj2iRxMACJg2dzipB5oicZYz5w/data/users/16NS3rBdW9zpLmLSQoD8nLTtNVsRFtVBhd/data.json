Without money zeronet will stay a curiosity\n\nI'm blocking ads, because even the most popular websites on the clearnet have ads with malware payloads.\n\nI've even complained in a review of Bacon Camera that its ads have the same problem. The developer thinks I'm lying, says they use Google's Adsense, so that's worrying.\n\nZeroNet is better without ads, IMHO.\n\nI would block clearnet resources too if Blokada allowed me to block internet access to a browser, but Blokada gets rid of what is an actual danger to my devices.",

Krixano liked the layout I proposed, though he was asking for social network suggestions to begin with ever since he thought about making one.\n\nPeople like the voice messaging idea.\n\nNofish showed interest in prioritizing bandwidth to the currently viewed site, but doesn't know how to do that yet.\n\nPeople also like the ZeroMobile idea, but there's no native support built into ZeroNet to handle it.\n\nSo, you can put your ideas out there and vote for what you like while you know that it's not all so simple. I don't think people mind.\n\nWe're all looking forward to an expanded app ecosystem.\n\nI get it that you don't want to pester people. That's how I am. I was probably quite annoying, so now I dish ideas out more thoughtfully and less rapidly. I do need to keep notes before I forget though. I had a few ponderings and ideas that have escaped me.\n\nAll I can offer is ideas since I don't know how to build a dynamic site, as is the case with many of us.\n\nYou might have great ideas worth discussing and exploring, and that's perfectly fine.",

Maybe if the code is portable to Java or C++ without much need for compatibility checks might it be good for someone, but web browsers do enough already.\n\nReally, all that gets in the way of a native-like experience on ZeroNet is the browser UI.",
