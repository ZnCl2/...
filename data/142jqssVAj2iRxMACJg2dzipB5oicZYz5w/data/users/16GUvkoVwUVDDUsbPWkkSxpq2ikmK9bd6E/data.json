				"body": "**Better torrent site**\nThe Pirate Bay will fall soon, I believe. They just recently lost their .se-address. When it falls apart, ZeroNet will have a huge opportunity to grow to humongous proportions, if it can just provide a New Pirate Bay. *One that is easy to use and accessible. The target audience is the same as The Pirate Bay.*\n\n\n\n**Extend ZeroTalk into a full-fledged decentralized community**\n* Simple personal pages - where you can link to your projects / other pages, or write stuff about yourself\n* Personal messages - send messages to other people, encrypted of course\n\n\n\n**CopyBazaar**\nOpen distributed market place. A copy of OpenBazaar, but built to run in ZeroNet. People can put up shops and offer their products, hold auctions or whatever. A distributed/decentralized Ebay.\n* Could probably benefit from some integrated zeronet-wallet.",
