Sade, the hippies, Foucault, Alan Turing: one needs not look very deep into political philosophy to find that sex applies first and foremost to culture and social structure, especially for a species called Homo sapiens sapiens (as in \"wisest of the wise\"). And homosexuality (homo as in \"same\") is a better suited form of sexuality to human progress than heterosexuality can ever be. DNA has been deprecated by the emergence of writing and made completely obsolete with digital culture. Obsolete, except for sex, that is. :D\n\nPax",

I am slowly dumping all my archives on the topic on the subject here on ZeroNet. But it's all in French (Quebecois, rather). So, I'll try to summarize here. Most of those points have been developed in details by Greek thinkers so it's not difficult to find out more if you want. On a philosophical basis, \"homo\" as in \"same\" is the basis for humanism and anarchy. Feminism understood as valuing behavioral \"complementarity\" is the direct opposite view. Feminism is not a humanism. It is a regressive sexism. Merely homophobia by another name. It goes back to the prehistoric \"sacred feminine\". Nothing new under the sun. It blocks progress. That is why governments like it so much, as made blatantly evident by how it has been instrumentalized by the powers that be everywhere in the last 2-4 years. Heterosexual power struggles always have and always will fail. Progress is homoerotic because that's where it gets its energy. A bunch of drunk dudes will eventually end up saying how much they \"love\" each other, and then change the world (\"bros before hoes\", « Liberté, Égalité, FRATERNITÉ »). Try intelligence on the straight dating scene (\"no homo\") and see what you get. Pretty much \"How Soon is Now\". You need to listen to the song itself, but here are the lyrics: \n\nI am the son\nAnd the heir\nOf a shyness that is criminally vulgar\nI am the son and heir\nOf nothing in particular\n\nYou shut your mouth\nHow can you say\nI go about things the wrong way?\nI am human and I need to be loved\nJust like everybody else does\n\nThere's a club if you'd like to go\nYou could meet somebody who really loves you\nSo you go and you stand on your own\nAnd you leave on your own\nAnd you go home and you cry\nAnd you want to die\n\nWhen you say it's gonna happen \"now\"\nWell when exactly do you mean?\nSee I've already waited too long\nAnd all my hope is gone\n",

Do you feel that I am intellectually discriminating against you? Sleeping with you would be another debate. But I will pursue this conversation as long as I feel I'm getting something out of it.\n\n> They think that women are underprivileged and then try to fix it.\n\nAutists are underprivileged (or are they?) and they don't have \"autistism\". Or it is not as prevalent. Would they too benefit from that synonym?\n\nSome people say what doesn't kill you makes you underprivileged. Other (usually better) people say it makes you stronger.\n\nOccam's Razor tells me that if you think natural selection is immoral, fix biology. You need not come up with God, Man and Patriarchy. Like, at all. If you are honest, that is.\n\n> Isn't that true to all power struggles though? Please don't take this as if I was defending heterosexuality, I'm just trying to expand this idea.\n\nEvolution is a power struggle, and I agree with Teilhard de Chardin that its teleology is intelligence. So no, I would say that a power struggle that leads to more intelligence (collective, individual) is a success and if it does not, it's a failure. Extinction would be the ultimate failure, here, of course. It happened to genes, it happened to species, it happened to cultures. All this before there was post-colonialist and feminist ethical rethorics. It will continue to happen, because meritocracy and natural selection work.\n\n> I know what you mean and I agree in principle. But I don't think you are referring specifically to homosexual people, but reasonable people. \n\nOr intelligent people. That being said, « sexual cognitive dimorphism » actually is a thing.\n\n> I think that's just a perception. I have \"dated\" a lot of heteros (that sounded a bit brag-ish), some homos and my conclusion is that what makes people interesting, intelligent and attractive (not physically) is their personality and their attitude.\n\nAgain, we are talking about biology, so hypothesis are verified statistically and not absolutely. Rigorous sampling is thus called for. Make a list of historical figures you admire (at least a 100) and work your way through their sexuality. Usually, because we all know sex, gender and intelligence are related, historians have devised of a couple of ways to infer about one's sexuality when it cannot be determined for sure. Make an Excel spreadsheet if need be. I'm curious to see it.\n\n9 out of 10 guys I sleep with identify themselves as heterosexuals. They can identify themselves as attack helicopters for all I care. We are talking about attractions and tropisms that lead to meaningful and intelligence-enhancing relationships. Labels are not the whole story here. Do I identify as gay myself ? Not if is going to undermine courtship. LOL, sadly.\n\n> I agree that some hetero dudes are just meatheads. But I wouldn't be honest with myself if I said that those are the majority.\n\nOh no my friend, the almost TOTALITY of hetero dudes are just meatheads. The rest are in some sort of unfortunate closet.\n\n> All in all, I think this right here is what anarchism is all about. We can have different views but the same principles. We love who we love and fuck who we fuck but in the end, we are all together. Opresive and regressive ideologies have no power when WE THE BOLD decide to be together, not the same.\n\nIn principle, who am I to disagree to that ? :D",

It's still \"survival of the fittest\", not \"survival of the most intellectually accessible\".\n \n> I think it's very unlikely that you believe that feminism, or at least the version I described previously, is about biology.\n\nTry me.\n\n> Do you mean that homosexual power struggles lead to more intelligence? That's a bold statement, I would like to see some proof.\n\nTrust me: you DON'T want to see the proof.\n\n> So you agree with me.\n\nNo.\n\nPlease.\n\n> I wasn't, I was talking about social change. Feminism is not about biological change, I don't think. That's why I mentioned privilege. Male and females are different, that's a fact. Their social \"privilege\" is the issue here.\n\nSocial privileges based on biological differences have nothing to do with biology ? Makes sense.\n\nNot.\n\n> I can't see how that is true.\n\nI believe you and I'm now convinced you never will \"see\". So, what's the point ?\n\nNone.\n\n> Citation needed.\n\nReally ? What for…? For me to justify the effort, I'd have to have a minimal hope that this conversation can \"converge\". I don't.\n\n> :D sorry if I sounded a bit weird\n\nNo. You don't sound « weird ».\n\n> I promise nothing at all that I write is meant to mock you.\n\nPhobia in \"homophobia\" means fear, not mockery.\n\n> When I say stuff like \"I agree in principle\" I often mean that I agree with what you mean and not what you said.\n\nHard fact: I'm the only one talking to you here.\n\nI'm sure you're a marvellous person. I would just spank you a little bit now. Really works miracles. :D",
