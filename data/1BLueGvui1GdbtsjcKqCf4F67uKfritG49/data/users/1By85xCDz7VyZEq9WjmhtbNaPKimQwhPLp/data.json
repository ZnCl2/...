It was only yesterday that a colleague told me that she had been to Wuhan recently, and suddenly my heart became heavy. Because my hometown is Weifang, the original plan was to return to my hometown tomorrow. This time I was very embarrassed and didn't know how to deal with it.\n\nFinally decided to return home. Departing on the 24th, 2 hours later, at the intersection of the expressway, they were tested and examined, and their body temperature passed normally.\n\nThe primary cause of this outbreak is the Wuhan government. When the outbreak occurred, the government not only failed to tell the public in time, but instead dealt with those who spread the news online. If it wasn't for Academician Zhong Nanshan's public meeting in Wuhan that medical personnel had been infected, it would not be known how long this serious epidemic would be concealed.\n\nThe Wuhan government is a bad government, and it has been reflected in the handling of p2p incidents. When proactively resolving such crises across the country, the Wuhan government decided to use procrastination. What's more interesting is that Yunnan solved the case for Wuhan and named Wuhan's efforts in the past few years. Internet financing such as Yirong Hengxin and Compound Investment are illegal and illegal. When the Yunnan case was filed for investigation, the Wuhan government and the public security department faced it negatively. Today, the above two platforms are in a state of non-payment.\n\nEither God's providence or man-made disaster. The development of the epidemic to this day is closely related to the consistent inaction of the Wuhan government.\n\nStarting at 10 am on January 23, Wuhan began to close the city. The Wuhan government did not choose to report the truth truthfully at the beginning of the epidemic. It's amazing how big a city can be.\"\n\nsource: [/15b76H3Atqkne8WXdSzfJdeKGhX7FdktHi/?Post:7:武汉新型肺炎跟踪更新](/15b76H3Atqkne8WXdSzfJdeKGhX7FdktHi/?Post:7:武汉新型肺炎跟踪更新)",
