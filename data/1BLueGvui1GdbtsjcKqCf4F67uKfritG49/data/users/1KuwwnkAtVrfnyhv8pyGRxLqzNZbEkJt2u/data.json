			"body": "Thanks people for your contribution ! Here I want to share my thoughts on this.\n\nSome of you mentioned that because you don't have a central server, we are not tracking user and collecting data. It is I believe an important point that I think we can take further. Relying on selling data users for profit also have a big impact on design and user experience. The UX is being developed as a way to generate users data and doesn't contribute in creating a quality UX. I would even argue that it has created toxicity (even enhance hate ?...). Metrics used to build UX never consider the quality of the exchanges.\n\nAnother point might be the necessity for privacy. Tor is already a good solution on its own for this. A recent post kind of strike me, it was a father mentioning that his daughter has drug problem (of course it was posted by Anonymous). Researching on google information for it would make them aware of this and this is frightening that big companies has those kind of information on minors. My believe is that privacy is needed to build fully grown and functional human being.\n\n\"Privacy is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves, or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.\" Sometime you need this and I think Zeronet also serve this purpose.\n\nDoes it make sense for people here what I wrote ?",

An example would be on twitter where you have notification on post you don't even care. The starring system which kind of trigger your need for attention... Encouraging you to post puns more than quality post... I haven't given much more thought on this.\n\n\nWhat do you think ? Does it make sense ?",
