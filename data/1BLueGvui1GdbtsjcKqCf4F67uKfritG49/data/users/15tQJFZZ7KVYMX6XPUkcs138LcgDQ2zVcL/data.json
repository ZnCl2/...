			"body": "<pre>\n\nI think the best way to answer your question is with a question.\n\nWhat is free speech and freedom of expression good for?\n\nThe answer is that free speech and freedom of expression is critical to the survival and evolution of the human race.\n\nFor example, early man learned through the exercise of free speech that's some wild berries were safe to eat, while others were poisonous. That's some snakes are non venomous, while others were deadly.\n\nToday, humanity is drowning in bullshit and fake news. Not only what you see and hear, but more importantly, what you don't see or hear about. Most popular social media sites are little more than captive portals, walled gardens and echo chambers of pure bullshit and fake news. It's so bad that it has even corrupted the very internet itself.\n\nZeronet and similar technologies hold the promise of solving this critical, and often deadly and expensive problem of modern society. You can do everything with Zeronet that you can do on the internet today, and a lot more. I think Zeronet Etc is the next step. The Holy Grail.\n\nZeronet's development and function is much like that of the early internet, and we all know what happened there..üòä Technology tends to develop exponentially. I think you will see the same with Zeronet.\n\nJust knowing that I can say what I want to say. All without some jackass arbitrarily and completely removing me. Just knowing that I can have an online presence that no one can capriciously delete. No matter how far up somebody's ass I've got my dick..üòà\n\nZeronet is excellent. And It will become more user friendly and accessible. Which in turn will improve it's  popularity. In my opinion Zeronet needs a more robust social media mode. Zeronet's current social media mode seems somewhat neutered.\n\nUser timelines need to be more complete and comprehensive. Containing all of a users post and comments. And user timelines need to be easier to scan and review. Twitter does this well. As did the old Statusnet, which Twitter descends from.\n\nFor example, I'v answered your question many times. You should be able to just easily scan my timeline and discover that. But all of our comments aren't in our timelines, yet. \n\nI think eventually this will come, along with a lot of other apparently planned user customizations. Like the way we used to be able to customize our MySpace profile or sites. I really liked that. Centralized social media is about controlling you. That's why you aren't allowed much customization. You're their bitch.\n\nAnd now with Zeronet you can have all that, plus a site that can't be taken down. That doesn't need permission, or a tech guru like me to keep it running for a fee.\n\nMy hope Is that technologies like Zeronet will evolve into a global public forum. Where all the important topics of the day can be discussed. Out in the open. Without any place to hide. So that truth can be discovered, and consensus formed..üëçüòÄüéâüéäüéÜüóΩ\n\n</pre>",

			"body": "<pre>\n\nViolet Blue, I miss that girl.. She's a wonderful writer. As I've said many times, censorship is a slippery slope. Your terrorist is my freedom fighter. Your Nazi is my (((**Nasi**))).\n\nI truly miss the sex workers and pornstars I used to follow on Twitter. They were such a pleasure, and so much more than I had any idea they were. Smart, substantial women you would want to know and have a relationship with. Regardless of sex.\n\nThey're pornographic sexuality was just delicious icing on a delicious cake. Though I did get sugar overload, and have some earth-shattering falls and fried power grids, ( when the birds fell from the skies, and the fish washed up from the waters and the seas, Everywhere!).\n\nAlas, after 9 years Twitter suddenly and arbitrarily banned me. I begged for the benefit of my followers for Twitter to take me back, and promised I would be good. Something I would ordinarily never do. But I never heard back from Twitter. \n\nConservatives say I'm a liberal, and liberals say I'm a conservative. (((**Nasi**))) say I'm a Nazi. Of course I'm all of those things, and none of those things.\n\n‚ÄúIn a time of deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.‚Äù¬†¬† G. Orwell\n\nI managed to conceal my true identity lol, just long enough (9 years) to gain a better insight into the sex industry and its impact on women. I truly feel like I have a much better understanding and appreciation of sex work and sex workers now.\n\nFor many women it can be quite lucrative. But for many others it can be quite cruel and exploitive. These so-called survival sex workers are the ones I and many others are most concerned, and worried about.\n\nI support amnesty International's recommendations that sex work should be decriminalized. But I fear it will be a long time before we ever see that in the United States. In the meantime providing sex workers with some measure of mobile food security could go a long way in helping provide some level of harm reduction.\n\nOne of the primary vulnerabilities and tools of exploitation of survival sex workers is hunger, and food insecurity. I think that if we could provide sex workers and other wemon with mobile food security (city, state, national) they would be less vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And better able to flee abusive situations.\n\nRelatively speaking, it wouldn't cost much. The hard part is just figuring out how to administer it. While sidestepping all the assholes who try to sabotage an exploit these type of social programs for the needy.\n\nMy hope is that in the next few years we will see true Universal Health Care. And a modern version of the old campaign promise of two chickens in every pot on Sunday. Basically some kind of grocery card redeemable at any store for a monthly allotment of groceries.\n\nThe United States gives wealthy people over 500 billion dollars in interest payments on borrowed money. Borrowed money used to avoid  wealthy people's fair share of taxes. While most Americans receive nothing but a 22 trillion debt liability.\n\nYou could provide every US man and woman two hundred a month grocery allotment for 440 years. For the 500 billion interest each year you could provide every US man and woman 200 a month grocery allotment for 10 years.\n\nI think the American people are going to demand this, along with demanding universal healthcare as a human right..üòä\n\n</pre>",
