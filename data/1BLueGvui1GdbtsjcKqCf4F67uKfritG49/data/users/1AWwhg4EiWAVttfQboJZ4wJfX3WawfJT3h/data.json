[Android app](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/), there is also [a headless app](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kiwix-cli-git/), so it can be used across different devices in the same network like ZeroNet. For books there is [Gutenburg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), and sorry for German fellows because it probably [gets blocked](https://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/project-gutenberg-blocks-german-users-from-downloading-ebooks). There are also old Gutenburg archives as Kiwix files (created in 2014), so I can have the whole library offline, English archive is 40G, a bit too large, German archive is fine (509M). And yep some books of mine are pirated, I'm proud of myself for downloading a lot of books shared by net friends when I was in university :3, even though my university already has many libraries and huge book collections, the book sharing environment online is very awful now.. and I just saw this news..: [Switzerland Takes Steps Against eBook Piracy](https://goodereader.com/blog/digital-publishing/switzerland-takes-steps-against-piracy).\n--- ---\nI agree that DRM is plague. With DRM, besides we can't share books, it's possible that all books will automatically get burned when Amazon goes down, I doubt if they have a solution now. If you really want some new published books to read, I think it's possible to contact the author to release it in DRM-free form, if the author can't because of some contract.. one solution is DRM-removed tool, or copy the content to another format. Ebook is a big business now, so unfornately things won't get better in these years I guess.",

Btw, emailing the author to accept Bitcoin donation sounds improper. Bitcoin is widely accepted, but I can't imagine one day it will cover every individual.",

Especially if the current online banking/payment system needs more energy than bitcoin, then it's totally a different story.. It's hard to prove and probably no one will investigate it though.\n\n> Bitcoin’s total electricity consumption is believed to be around 15 TWh.\n\nBut from [Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity a year than Ireland](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/27/bitcoin-mining-consumes-electricity-ireland):\n> According to Digiconomist the estimated power use of the bitcoin network, which is responsible for verifying transactions made with the cryptocurrency, is 30.14TWh a year, which exceeds that of 19 other European countries.\n\nChina may have the highest ability for Bitcoin mining. But it's illegal (or is banned) and thus risky. Promoting a new tech by encourging corruption and bribe is a bad joke imho (but I agree that in reality it may happen..).\n\nAnd just a fresh rumor [from coinforum.de](https://coinforum.de/topic/13027-anonymit%C3%A4t-von-cryptocoins-und-eventuelle-regulierungs-bzw-verbotsversuche/) ..\n> Gerade steht ja der G20 Gipfel an und auch Kryptowährungen sind dort ein Thema. Für den Bitcoin, Litecoin oder andere pseudonyme Kryptocoins dürfte sich nicht viel ändern, jedenfalls nicht für deutsche oder europäische Handelsplätze da hier ja eigentlich schon alles recht ordentlich geregelt ist, siehe Bitcoin.de. Ohne sich zu verifizieren kann man dort sowieso schon lange nicht mehr handeln.",

Not being discouraged is a bit hard, but anyway it won't become a reason that may drive me leave ZeroNet.\n> Sometimes I wonder where people go when they leave zeronet. ...\n\nImo most people are busy with their jobs and daily life, so Internet is just a place for shitposting or looking for some funny stuff. So they don't care about which platform is better as long as it can provide such simple need.\n\nNew tech/platform/site can attract a lot of attention, but usually it won't last long if it can't give user a long term reason. I guess one of Nofish's main goal is anti-censorship, which provides a long term reason for politicians on revolution, sub-culture enthusiasts or others who simply suffer ridiculous censorship from the authority/administration, ZeroNet will surely become a safe harbor/refugee shell/haven for them. But still revolution politics is dangerous, I wonder if Nofish already received quite some blackmails, anyway he is an IT expert and lives in Hungary, so probably he is safe.\n\nProfitability is probably another long term reason, but people usually can't make/become true friends (or have long term relationship as mentioned by Eibriel) if they care too much about profit imo. I don't like viewing too many posts that are directly related to profit reason/intention, it's just like many people are simply advertisement media.\n\nBtw, I saw someone on ZeroTalk tried to advertise the good of religion like it can bring people together. I will simply stay unrelated to these things because the bad part of religion scares me to the deep (like sacrifice and assassination). Local community/culture is a better choice imho, I like my local culture so I'm not that lonely actually. I agree that religion still has its position in modern society as many social/society problems can be easily solved by it though..",

It has its merits in bringing people together, sure. But it is more often misused as a political instrument of power.\n\nYep, actually there are probably many different religions in my local culture (like in Japan and Taiwan I guess), e.g. celebrity [Han Yu](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Yu) from Tang dynasty once got exiled by the government and became an official here, he helped a lot the local civilization development and thus became a celebrity here, even today there are still lots of buildings and ceremonies related to him and such things probably can be treated as a religion. But most outsiders will simply treat them as superstition, for Christian or Muslim they will even be treated as paganism.. Talking too much about religion publicly is probably not a good idea and improper, so you don't need to reply to this :)",
