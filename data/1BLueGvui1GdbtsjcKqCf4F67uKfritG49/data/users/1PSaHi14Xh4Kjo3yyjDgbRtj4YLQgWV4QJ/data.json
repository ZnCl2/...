Current implementations of Lightning rely on Segwit, although other malleability fixes would theoretically also work. I'm very optimistic for Lightning.  Energy is an issue, but one that is not so easy to solve. If proof by something else worked, it would be like perpetual motion: highly desirable, but very hard to achieve. Asic resistance doesn't solve the energy issue, it is only a bit better for decentralization. But even for Monero there are some ASICS in the planning. If somebody considers Bitcoin unethical, he either works for a bank, or feels he was too late to the game. I can understand FOMO only to a certain degree. It should be more about the transaction properties and censureship resistance than about the price.
