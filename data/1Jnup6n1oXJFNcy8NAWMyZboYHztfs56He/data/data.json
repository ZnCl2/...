I've been feeling pretty laggy when it comes to new projects, so for now the game zite is gonna be put to the back burner. In the mean time, I think I will go experiment with doing a video hosting zite. So far I'm seeing zites that refer to outside storing sources. This defeats the purpose since it introduces a single point of failure: communication between zite and the sources, even if the source itself is also p2p. I will try using zeroNet on its own to see if I can make a videohosting zite. Stay tuned."

			"body": "It's been a a few weeks since I started my endeavor into ZeroNet and I've been really into this concept of being able to send temporary messages into a kind of message board system. The best I've got so far is the Whisper site: http://localhost:43110/1dhDNnytBKPaKJ913hQUqTqPW1mz6QCXh\n\nA clone modification of the original Zerochat, this instead relies on route() to check if new files have been added and their contents are immediately displayed. The way data files are written is to only have one message and is published it to peers. This means that all peers only remember the latest message sent by any user.\n\nI'm still figuring out how to get past the problem of third party content. For now, i'm relying on the zeroID certification, but preferably in the future it would not have to be this way to truly be whispering into the wind."
