I used to have a post in this blog called \"another way to use IPFS\". There was a link that led to IPFS site. On that site there was my pingpong game. But I have decided to move the game to ZN (look My Sites -> Ping Pong), so that if I want to change anything, it will be easier to share (just press \"sign\"). Plus on ZN I can track how many ppl have my site and on IPFS all I have is my hope xD",

The movie has disappointed me somewhat, but the reason for that feeling was that it is impossible to compress Ender's Game in 2 hours. I have realised that when I thought \"man! they skip a scene after scene and all they show is as if playing in \"fast froward\"! 15 minutes passed and Ender is already a commander! What's wrong with those guys?!\" Then I've checked a play time and a counter was showing about an hour. So even with such a great speed of event-shift, the movie is quite big. Movie makers did what they could and the result is not bad. Children act pretty well there.\n\nWatch the movie again (if you have a couple of hours), but take in consideration the fact that main actors there are children (lots of them), and that film DOES show all main moments from the book in only 2 hours.\n\nAnd if they had decided to make the film larger (3 hours?), MAYBE they could make a film a little more like the book, but then it would require several more weeks to make it.
