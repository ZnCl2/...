There were a few living roots left, so there is a TINY chance the plant will live yet."

			"body": "Well, kind of. I had a distortion of taste because of my covid last January, and for about 10 months I could not eat most food. Bland macaroni diet has worn me out, and lack of tasty stuff has driven me into a state when I just didn't care much about things one way or another.\n\nBUT! A few days ago I've found out that I can use peanuts (which are distorted in a milder way) to blunt the distortion to complete(?) nothingness!\n\nFor a while now I knew that if I keep eating stuff that I have problems with (and don't puke somehow), the taste will come to normal for a short duration. That's how I've once eaten kebab and another time even pizza was almost normal!\n\nBut I've recently found out that some food works better as a fixer and all that was left for me was to stumble upon a cheap and good one. Peanuts! (and possibly lots and lots of stress, but let's hope the former is enough...)\n\n1-2 days ago I've eaten peanuts for breakfast because it was almost 16:00 and I was quite hungry, as you might imagine. And then it struck me that even though I had trouble with the first couple of nuts, all the rest were tasty and nice! So without any delay I've opened a chocolate bar and started chewing. And it was SO GREAT! I haven't tasted a good real chocolate for almost a year! 10 months! And this one was a giant chocolate bar of quite decent quality, nuts and orange (present, but not too much of it).\n\nToday was the day I've finally beaten one of 2 worst nemeses - coffee. For this whole time I could be used to determine if the coffee was real or just some crap-shit mix. Real coffee literally caused me to either faint or puke depending on how much I wanted either one of these. But with the help of super peanuts I've just drunk a cup of coffee and cream and even kind of enjoyed it! It's a complete victory! And I have to say that peanuts go quite good with almost anything, especially coffee. So it's a win-win))\n\nNext item on the list will be eggs. Even thinking of them made my head hurt, but  I have to try it. If I can eat eggs, or at least chicken, it will make my wife happy almost more than it will make me happy myself xD"

(Touch is a more accurate term for the interaction, since the screen reacts to finger's capacity, but I'd expect a cat to think of it as a pressure application.\n\nYes, before this day, she used to grab the screen, trying to catch the image.\n\nTo be continued when I'm not on the phone..)"

			"body": "My prime reason to be searching for a blog platform is that I now have a couple of predator plants! (not sure it's a correct name in English, but anyway..) So obviously my first more or less informative post here will be about them üòÅ\n\nThey are Mexican Pinguicula and Nepenthes. Yeah, we really wanted Venus Flytrap, but we were told she's a bitch when it comes to holding it at home. Drosera was one of our choices, but first two seemed like the best plants for a beginner.\n\nThe first thing we were told to do was to name them, then to find them a good spot, put them there and not to touch for a few days. And to never ever move them from this spot.\n\nThe first task was hard, because I don't like to come up with names, but with help of my wife, we now have Princess Pinguicula and Count Johny Nepenthes. You may guess that Alex helped me with the latter one twice as much xD\n\nNext task - find a place. Preferably an eastern window, (NOT southern), and most certainly not kitchen. BUUUT.... we only have southern windows. And a spot only in the kitchen. So it's not a perfect spot, but something to start with... It's always possible to add shading and keep the window partially open when Alex is cooking, right?\n\nThen I've started reading the manual in detail. And OH NO, they are totally different. One grows in the sunny Mexican tropics, and the other one in the cold mountains of somewhere...\n\nOf the two of them, Princess should be the least capricious, so the temperature and humidity were selected somewhere in between, closer Nepenthes. But very soon Pinguicula went into cold shock and we had to MOVE them apart.\n\nWith all 3 first rules kinda broken, I spent several days dancing around them, buying stuff like lamps, moss and distilled water to make their life bearable."

It's not a concept, it's a product.\n\n# Quite beautiful\n\nI'm not a designer, but I require stuff on my screen to be beautiful. At least, because that's what I'm staring at a lot. Qubes looks good.

For those who are still asking \"WHAT THE FUCK FOR??!\", I have an answer.\n\nFor years I lived with a thought that in our world, it's impossible to make any iformation really secure. I used to say \"there is no lock that can't be picked\". Always it's just a matter of time and effort.\n\nSome days ago I thought I've lost my phone. With all passwords stored in my browser, and most of my logins saved in cookies. To evade long list, I can just say that almost ALL my accounts would be compromised. So I've spent a day changing my passwords, encrypting portable devices I've had left.\n\nAnd when I finaly found my phone and encrypted all I could without much of an effort, still I felt some new thought and ideas sitting inside my head. Like \"Why those governments are spying on us so easily, while we can make their life so much harder by a little bit of work on our side?\" But most importantly, the question \"Is it possible to at least have a chance of being secure in this world?\"\n\nSo, the answer I got was \"depends on how secure you wanna be, what exactly you want to do with your system and what do you expect to happen.\"\n\nMy problem is mostly with nosy people. And I wanna make my security holes so tiny, that they would have to sniff **THAT HARD** in order to get anything.\n\nAgain, I belive that it's impossible to be absolutely safe. I just want governments to do some Proof of Work, not Proof of Stake... for a change =D"

			"body": "I've seen a dream, that I would like to remember, and not shy enough to not share. So the blog will do.\n\nI've woken up somewhere in a wooden house, probaby in the country. My friend is there. Also 2 other people - friends of my friend. One I've seen before, another - not.\n\nI'm awaken by my friend. She told me something, told me who has arrived while was asleep? I welcomed her with a smile, since we don't usually touch each other. A friend of her that I know I welcomed in my dream with \"Yea, I saw you there...\", and thinking \"..wish I have not.\" And she went into the background, almost disappearing in it. Person I liked, then was nothing but an imprint on the background of my story. Would she return? To what end?\n\nThere is another one to great. I see her, in a second (as usually) I size her up. Not my type.. Who is?.. In 5 seconds (as usually) I know just how much of her is needed in my life. But this time I'm tired. Too tired to play any strategy. So I just tell her that in the morning the only thing I miss is a hug. No hints, no secrecy. Plain-text, no encoding, for all around to read.\n\nCompatibility test is passed - she hugs me and kisses me in the cheek. I hug her, but kiss her in the neck and the nose. She is startled, but don't blush. The reaction I needed most.\n\n_I had to make a pause, and details of the dream are fading  away. I turn the music on. Louder. Making sort of a locator out of it. Music distrupts my attention from the road and people, but being too loud it does not attract me. So I burrow deeper into my mind, in a search for a lost dream._\n\nThe following week, I get from my job earlier in an attempt to meet her more often. That angers my boss (mom). She makes it harder and harder for me to go early. Now I have a real reason to call her a \"bossy bitch\".\n\nOne day I am unable to finish my work in time  and go to meet the girl anyway. Mother is angry, but I make it a point that there is no way she can stop me. Not only I'm stubborn, I also don't like to deal with other stubborn people. When a conflict is inavoidable, I'd rather let her detonate, than keep trying to please her. In the end, I'd rather be with a wife, than with a mother.\n\nThe last glance, the last touch, the last talk. I enjoy every second. I won't be remembering the words when I wake up, but I will remember the warmth and comfort I felt. I won't remember what she looked like, but I will remember what I felt when I was looking at her. So well that I will be able to reconstruct her face. That is the reason I touch her lips, that is the reason I smell her hair, that is the reason I hold her hand.\n\nMother will find a way to stop me. She will wake me up. \"Get up! We are in a hurry!\" She won't know why I will welcome her with anger. She won't care. Good. There will be a rainy day.\n\nGood morning, ZeroNet. Musickiller is on the line."

Realisation that someone might get access to my email (means \"all my accounts without double authorisation\"), and my browser (all open accounts and some saved passwords) made me feel uneasy.\n\nToday was a day when I thought \"hey! Any half-lame hacker can read my key files only because they are stored on 4 unencrypted devices, on 3 different platforms!\" So I've encrypted my tablet and made plans of encrypting my notebook and (may be) computer. PC's HD is ticking like a bomb already, so quite soon no one will be  able to read that data =D\n\nSo imagine how have I felt when exactly today I could not find my phone. Ofcourse I've revoked all authrisation that I could and changed some passwords, and then found the phone... But the feeling I still remember.\n\nSo as soon as I found it, I've locked it with a password. Can't encrypt it, but password will be enough, since there are no key-files there.\n\nSo today... ugh... Yesterday I've stepped into the world where the source I can trust most is my own head. I've also discovered that I remember almost all passwords that I make. Cool. All I had to do was to make it a high priority information and my head has stored it safe.\n\nBut some things are unclear to me. And if you are still reading it, I would appreciate some comments. How does encryption help, if as soon as I decrypt the drive, anyone from outside can read the data just as easy as he would have if the data was unencrypted? Or drive encryption actually helps even when one person has decoded it? And if it is so on linux, is it the same way on android or linux? You can just send places where I can read about it myself, if you don't want to write about it yourself...\n\nGood night, people of ZeroNet. Don't loose your phones. And your heads too."

Or why have no one done it yet?!\n\n---\n\n---\n\n#Introdiction\nI think that the best storage project would be a distributed web of people that gain credits for storing files of other people and use them for storing their own files.\n\n_I have to check all of this a couple of times, and I'll refine my thoughts in some time. Please don't judge too harsh now. But still I do need critics._\n\n#Old Stuff\n_I'll rewrite it later. Sorry to leave it this way((_\n\n~~You give 4 GB of space to store someone's data for 30 days and get 120 credits. If you cancel the deal, you loose all 120 credits. You have to be active for at least 3-6 hours every day or you'll loose credits.~~\n\n_this parts looked most stupid, so I've wrote about money and credits in the end of this post. But I have to save this stuff too, since if I delete it, I might forget some parts of this concept_\n\n~~You can give 120 credits to store 1 GB of data for 30 days on 4 computers on the network, or 512 MB on 8 computers (depending on how much redundancy do you need).~~\n\nAnd ofcourse it would have all those PGP and sharing from keybase, blah-blah-blah...\n\nThere should be a blockchain for the currency (and may be PC names? Yea. don't trust IP!)...\n\nis that so hard to do? Why do people still use servers to store data???\n\n~~And see how cool it is: you just give 40 GB for a day, download the data, check it, get your 40 credits store 200 MB of documents for 20 days on 10 computers and the next day you can delete that 40 GB of trash and live freely, knowing that your info is secure!~~\n\nHowever, it's gonna be a very slow system. You'll need to wait while people will upload their data into your PC, then wait for HOURS while your stored data is offline (even 10 PCs won't be online 24/7, what if you stored your data on 3 PCs?).\n\nAnd also who said that you'll have all your 40 GB filled at once? Most probably that means that the credit system should be reworked, or smth... But anyway, the idea is good, I know it!\n\n#NEW Stuff!\n#Money and Credits\n\n_I have been thinking more about this topic and have fixed price is not a good idea. Look how I think it might actually work:_\n\n## Data Lenders\nLet's imagine that the system is running already for some time (5-10 months) and there are already enough people in it. When somebody new comes to the system, he gets an account (in the blockchain), and he buys some credits from people that want money for their work. On some board (NXT-like or non-blockchain-at-all) he sets maximum price and how many computers he wants his data to be stored on all the time. As soon as he finds enough Offers, his data is uploaded and stored. I'm not yet shure when exactly credits should be transfered, but let's go further.\n\n##Data Holders\nThis time let's imagine someone that has space on his drives, and wants to earn some money from it (why keep your TB drives empty, when they can bring at least some money?) The guy goes into the network, sets up an account and sets how much space he can offer, for how long, how often he will be online (maximum) every day (evey week?), and how much miminal price for his services is. When a client finds him (automagicly), data is transfered into his drives. Every day he has to be online for a quota his client has set up. I suppose, that this should be checked by Forgers(?). An analogy with NXT, but here this guys will also check who's online, make searchable tables for Clients and some other dirty work. I suppose that if a Forger will have to send a thousand pings and a new block would be made every 10 minutes, and Data Holders would only need to answer to 1 ping every hour, the system will work well.\n\n_I have only wanted to write about monetary system here, but I'm being carried away somewhere, where I've not been thinking about yet. Gotta go to bed, it's 3:30 here already =(_\n\nSorry, no time to write. look at MaidSafe."

That Peter will pursue these ambitions of his so relentlessly that he'll never have a life.\"\n\n\"Conquering the world isn't a life?\" asked Bean.\n\n\"Alexander the Great,\" said Mrs. Wiggin. \"He haunts my nightmares for Peter. All his conquests, his victories, his grand achievements-they were the acts of an adolescent boy. By the time he got around to marrying, to having a child, it was too late. He died in the midst of it. And he probably wouldn't have done a very good job of it either. He was already too powerful before he even tried to find love. That's what I fear for Peter.\"\n\n\"Love? That's what this all comes down to?\"\n\n\"No, not just love. I'm talking about the cycle of life. I'm talking about finding some alien creature and deciding to marry her and stay with her forever, no matter whether you even like each other or not a few years down the road. And why will you do this? So you can make babies together, and try to keep them alive and teach them what they need to know so that someday they'll have babies, and keep the whole thing going. And you'll never draw a secure breath until you have grandchildren, a double handful of them, because then you know that your line won't die out, your influence will continue. Selfish, isn't it? Only it's not selfish, it's what life is for. It's the only thing that brings happiness, ever, to anyone. All the other things-victories, achievements, honors, causes-they bring only momentary flashes of pleasure. But binding yourself to another person and to the children you make together, that's life. And you can't do it if your life is centered on your ambitions. You'll never be happy. It will never be enough, even if you rule the world.\"\n\n\"Are you telling me? Or telling Peter?\" asked Bean.\n\n\"I'm telling you what I truly want for Peter,\" said Mrs. Wiggin. \"But if you're a tenth as smart as you think you are, you'll get that for yourself. Or you'll never have real joy in this life.\"\n\n\"Excuse me if I'm missing something here,\" said Bean, \"but as far as I can tell, marrying and having children has brought you nothing but grief You've lost Ender, you've lost Valentine, and you spent your life pissed off at Peter or fretting about him.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Now you're getting it.\"\n\n\"Where's the joy? That's what I'm not getting.\"\n\n\"The grief is the joy,\" said Mrs. Wiggin. \"I have someone to grieve for. Whom do you have?\"\n\nSuch was the intensity of their conversation that Bean had no barrier in place to block what she said. It stirred something inside him. All the memories of people that he'd loved--despite the fact that he refused to love anyone. Poke. Nikolai. Sister Carlotta. Ender. His parents, when he finally met them. \"I have someone to grieve for,\" said Bean.\n\n\"You think you do,\" said Mrs. Wiggin. \"Everyone thinks they do, until they take a child into their heart. Only then do you know what it is to be a hostage to love. To have someone else's life matter more than your own.\"\n\n\"Maybe I know more than you think,\" said Bean.\n\n\"Maybe you know nothing at all,\" said Mrs. Wiggin.\n\nThey faced each other across the table, a loud silence between them. Bean wasn't even sure they'd been quarreling. Despite the heat of their exchange, he couldn't help but feel that he'd just been given a strong dose of the faith that she and her husband shared with each other.\n\nOr maybe it really was objective truth, and he simply couldn't grasp it because he wasn't married.\n\nhttp://www.rulit.me/books/shadow-of-the-hegemon-read-69121-34.html"

Meditated for an hour. Nothing.\n\nOnly when I was writing to my sister, I had felt a rage of emotion deep under the calmness. But it was too easy to suppress. Like a bug that you stomp simply because it's less trouble dead than alive.\n\nI think yesterday I will have to face it all. But thank God, today I can sleep."

I wanted to write \"sorry\" here, but guys, seriously? For once in this year I have something to do besides sitting before a computer screen! I'm not sorry about it for damn sure! Sometimes I think, that programming is something I do when my friends say \"There is too much of you in my life\". **But**(!) I'll try to summ up here everything I can.\n\n#PC World\n##ZeroNet\n\n- I am still here\n- (On touch-screens) Now it's impossible to switch to ZeroHello with a Zero button in the corner, but possible to drag it and open a menu. OK.\n- tablet rules, because I have ZeroNet whenever I want it. Awesome. Double-avesome when I want to say \"Hey! Do you know what ZeroNet is? Look at that!\" And I don't have to show screenshots or describe how good it works, just show. I can even give the guy to check it on his own. I like that.\n- Yes, with ZN my tablet lives not as long as usually.\n\n##Time&Plans\n- Don't have it\n- Won't have it any time soon\n\n##Stuff\n- notebook serves me as a server. It has Sync, and ZeroNet, and qBitTorrent 24/7. Neat. And it's almost silent.\n\n#Real World\n##Cat\nIt's good to start with a cat, is it not?\n- It's still fat...\n- ...but became a little bit more angry. Now it's a little bit of skin on my palm that is missing and I think there will be a scar. Fluffy red fury...\n- But it still respects me like I'm his elder brother, sometimes it's trying to fight me, sometimes he sleeps on my arms (I'm still the only one whos arms he likes to sleep on. Even just to lay on. it's awesome ^_^)\n- When there was a salut on 9'th of May, he was scared and I hepled him by holding him. It's the first time an animal is **less** afraid of something when I hold it. All my dogs and cats usually tried to scratch their way away from my hands.\n\n##Last Weekend\nIt was the most awesome time in my recent life. Friends, family, I love you all, you are great. Thank you. I want to write more, but I was asked not to do that in order to evade unnecessary ( < here is a second word I've checked) questons.\n\n##My brain...\n...is ok. I'm ready for new stuff again. And I can't wait to get some. =^_^=\n\n##My Sisters\n2 - We still don't talk. Nothing changed here. We just have nothing to talk about.\n3 - We don't talk because she thinks I'm stupid. And for once in our history, I agree with that. I will try to change it when I have some time.\n5 - We don't meet and this time I think I know why. Great.\n\nAll - still are among the most important people in my life. I don't think it will change it next 4 years.\n\n##My Emotions\nDon't ask. I was building a wall that protected me from horrors of this world and horrors of this world from me. Weekend's hide-and-seek with my Bro made this wall break. I feel everything. May be I like it. I'm not sure. I've missed this feeling - oh yes. But it is going to ruin me if not handled with care. Gonna play around more. Block it again if can't handle it.\n\nAs usually the only thing I'm sure - I'm not scared, if there is something coming, I'll jump right in the middle of it and do my best.\n\n##My Fears\n???????\n\nA week ago I thought I've conquered the last of them. Now when my emotions are free, I have to check those cages in the back.\n\n##My plans\n- Work. All free time. I need money. Never ever said that before, by the way.\n- Learn? I still have something to do at the university. I'm not sure if that is called \"learn\" or \"study\", or there is any other word but \"waste my time\", but I need to finish it. My duty. I feel that I will need that in the future. Means I will try to do my best here too. Or at least not to drop out of it.\n- Spend time with friends and family. \"How, if I spen all free time for work?\" you ask? Easy. I use \"free\" time for work. Not \"Friends and Family\" time =) I plan to spend more time on them actually. Since I will have money to do that.\n\n#Something to end this post\nThere is much I wanted to write, but I don't have time and I think it's for the best. Writing too much is a bad habbit I was trying to kill."

I feel a little bit more complete and in peace with my past.\n\nIt's a big moment for me, even though it sounds stupid. I have not even known names of some of those movies and it is a miracle I've found them!\n\nIt has started with \"Spirits Within\" being recorded on last minutes of a video tape with my cartoons, and every time I've watched them, I also wanted to watch the movie of which I saw only first 5 minutes. Thanks to television I was able to find the name of the movie and watch about 2 years ago. (it may be the only time I say \"thanks\" to television, so it's also a small big moment here)))\n\nThere was also that other cartoon, which name I've forgotten, I've seen only 15 minutes of it (had to go to music school then. One of reasons I hated it was that unwatched cartoon.) and wanted very much to see all of it. Found it this year. When I saw the name on torrent list (probably was searching for porn though, but it's not a big probability, since the movie is about space and future) I felt an **urge** to watch it even though there was a lot of different tasty names around. I've felt that I have to. And I did.\n\nThere were some others and today it was Men in Black 3. I've watched last 30 minutes of it on the TV and wanted to see all of it. Today my Godfather shown me first 10 minutes, I've remembered about it and watched it (finished several minutes ago).\n\nSo now there is a big part of my history that is finished. Complete. Done. I can move on. A small but important relief."

I was too lazy to read stuff about it. I've just learned how to `import` them and made a train of small files one call another one (I just like to work in separate windows at the same time.

Using my laziness I've invented several ways to evade reading the book, all of which had led me to a conclusion: \"I need to read the manual!\"\n\nIt was like standing before a wall with horns of my stubbornness pressing against it (with no result of course) and at last being tired from the process with nothing left but to look on the wall and see the writing saying \"READ THE DAMN MANUAL!\"\n\nOr \"Speak 'Friend' and come in\"...

External Butchery. There was a problem with too many dead creatured carried to a butchery (3 hunters = lots of dead animals) and so miasma started to spread. I've decided that there is no problem with placing a butchery outside. Will male a minecart track there so that production would run faster.\n2. A road of dead trees. Auto tree-cut option of DF Hack glitched and has not unmarked trees. So not I have LOTS of logs. Really. I won't need more any time soon. Great idea by the way. I've heared that Elves make some quota of trees being cut per season. So now I can agree to any quota, coz I don't need to fall any more trees xD\n3. A bridge with a two-level-deep hole under it. Two level - because last time I've rissen a bridge when trolls were on it, almost nothing happened. One blue blood spatter (very nice and beautiful color! I've lured those trolls into the fortress to color walls in blue for some time =^_^=) I don't suppose that 2 levels is enough to kill anyone, but I won't waste more space under my fortress for something that might not work at all. I've heared that 15 levels is enought to make a stew out of a goblin, but hey... If I wanna do that, I'll make a FUN tower...\n4. Furniture storage and workshops. Yes, still in a single room with only a small stone storage...\n5. Under it is an enterance itself with dorminatory on 1 side and axes, picks and a hammer on the other. Currently only 1 axe, since a hammer was stolen and other tools are in use.\n6. Under it is a kitchen with a storage and some tables and chairs. Those are no burgers, those are barrels...\n7. The Great Hall. It's only great because there are statues and an artifact floodgrate (see \"X\" near the pointer). The main (and only) meeting area.\n\n## High Above.\n\n<a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmYvRUCy23wiQNf8H8HHRT3qritM14yeGjXgpSr5a492VV'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmYvRUCy23wiQNf8H8HHRT3qritM14yeGjXgpSr5a492VV'/></a>\n\nTWBT allows to see both tree tops and fort's enerance.

But I will still post it here. Comment on how do you think I can make it better.\n\nSo what is it: it is a story based on my progress in Dwarf Fortress. I will write from the perspective of one of Dwarfs I will be playing from the beginning. And some other Dwarf if the one on behalf of whom I speak will die. I will use \"thoughts\" of a dwarf to spot out things that he likes/dislikes/wants and announcements, fort statistics and my own observations to make things at least a bit more interesting (since almost all dwarf thinks of is work, drinks, weather and how comfortable the bed was (sounds familiar?)))) Also I will add a (very) little stuff from myself to make stuff sound more logical and nice.\n\nHere it is:\n\nIt was 15 of Granite in the year 250, when our new fortress, Tabarustuth, was started. It began as an idea to expand the territory of our nation, \"The Rack of Kindling\". Not a distant outpost, we were building very close to another Dwarven town (which name I have forgotten now). But because it's local forces were limited and required to fend off constant attacks of goblins, we had to rely on our own skills. May Ral Mineumber be with us and the peace throughout the world!\n\nAh yes, I am Urdim Zegdomas... or \"Tattooedguild\" on the Common-talk. I am chief medical dwarf (work as a carpenter). I am sixty-five years old. Just the right age for adventures!\n\n17.01.250 Tropics. Jungle. Not the best climate, our continent can provide, but far from being called the worst. However constant rains are trouble. I hope that miners will give us the comfort of the limestone rock soon.\n\n20.01.250 Litast Tunilul (\"Doorlords\"), our hunter, was using copper bolts, which is against rules, but he is a lover of our Expedition Leader, so I he definitely can do that...\n\n04.02.250 Mason's and carpenter's workshops are setup (some work at last!) and the main hall is carved out. More like a hole for now, but no time for lucsuries - we have to set up basic production chains as soon as possible. And when ale, wine and beer rivers run, we can do all the smoothing and engraving we want...\n\n01.03.250 A butchery and a dorminatory are complete. And work is going. And there is beer. Oh yes.. Beer is good. But I am constantly annoyed by rain and flies. Maybe it's good that my workshop is indoors!\n\n01.07.250 Autumn has come. So much has been done, but even more is to be done. Damn, we still don't produce alcohol! Imagine what can happen if we run out! And the winter is closing in!\n\nAlso we had some kea problem. Damn creatures have stolen both our axes, quivers, backpacks... Almost everything that we brought from our homelands! Not that I'm feeling sad.. Everything is pretty awesome... We have started to produce crafts yesterday. Shells. Too much refuse from all those turtles we ate.\n\nAlso our miners have dig up some space for farms! Great news. More mushrooms - more alcohol! All that's left is to bring some mud with water!..\n\n.07.250 Traders came. Asking for shields, cut gems and figurines. Shields... I hope, no wars are coming.. We bought some good beer from them. Not enough for the whole winter, I'm afraid.\n\n2.10.250 We have a problem. We have a big problem. I told them to finish farm preparation faster! I've told them! No one listened! Now it's winter and we have a VERY limited supply of drinks! And also we have that animal problem too... No water for them at all. Bad. We already have a yak and a horse dead..\n\nIf you live on a different continent, you might think that \"tropics\" means that we won't have any snow here, but anyone from our lands know how diverse is weather here. It's hot in summer and chilly in winter...\n\n26.10.250 A Moonstone. It's going to be a busy month. First - problems with water, now - Mistem Uzlirvabok has begun an artifact... Let's see what will happen next...\n\n03.11.250 Ilidlemis, \"Ruledvine\", a schist floodgate with an image of a forgotten beast. Marvelous construction. And useful! But I hear, our EL wants to install it in a statue garden. Not bad.\n\n26.12.250 Vutok Seloredem, our second Hunter (one of first immigrants) has been found dead. Hunter is a dangerous profession... We found his mangled corpse today. It seems that he run out of ammo. Our craftsdwarf was doing his best, but it was too much of work for a single person... People are going to be devastated. Miners have started to carve out first burial level... So it begins.\n\nA SUMMARY OF THE FIRST YEAR\n1 dead, 0 missing, 2 animals dead. Halls are carved several levels under the ground. But we spent so much time carving them, that we did not even started building befroms and specialised production rooms, so all dwarfs sleep in the first enterance hall, and in a room nearby all the production is going.\n\nAbout products we make - all very basic production chains are set up. (Not much of chains, we only work with stone, bone, shell and wood which now.) So we are waiting for Elven and Human caravans to show up. Human specially, since we have lots of wood after that planning problem. And when I say lots, I mean that we have enough for several years of wood-only production. I hope Elves won't mind that...\n\n01.01.251 Snow is melting, the word is that <s>hippys'</s> Elven caravan is coming soon. Gems are sent to the depot."

This time I had too much to think about, so extra 30 minutes I spent meditating.\n\nVery productive by the way. I've discovered that I can run just as good without any stimulators like music or perverted pictures. I've understood why do I run: it appears that I'm not trying to run away from anything, and instead, my runs are manifestation of my idea of searching, and of the pursuit of my dreams. And I have solved a dilemma I had with my sister (4-th cousin, if I'm writing it right).\n\nThe reason I've decided to go running was that I've found old messages from my sister. And there was a question whether I should break my promises to myself, fall on the floor, cry, and fuck my sisters brains for a couple of hours, or to find another way to deal with my emotions and thoughts.\n\nFor 2 hours of running my brain was denying to think about anything. But after that I felt an urge to take my headphones off. When I've done it, of thousands thoughts in my head, I saw only those I was interested in. They hit me like an electrical shock when I spoke them and all the pain and tiredness of my body faded as I did so. And when I had an answer about that message problem, I've decided to make another circle without music and go home. On that circle I've answered some questions about myself that were bothering me.\n\nSo instead of spending the extra energy I had in me, I've found even more.\n\nGood thing was that I have decided to run home after that last circle. When I switched to walk from run, I've felt, that I could barely stand. I've felt as if all my body was empty. But my mind was sharp and I did not collapse even when everything got blurry and dark.\n\nSurprisingly, no pain in my muscles today. Seems that 1-4 hours in the bathroom really does help.\n\nP.S. Yes, Erkan, you were right, I do tonns of mistakes. https://www.languagetool.org/ does help."

Where are smart guys and what they are doing???\n\nIt's possible to build a file sharing app by simply allowing ZN to wait longer for file transfer to be over, but if someone would be able to berge it with bittorrent stuff, it would be much better. Actually, what I was thinking was merging torrent with ZN, with dominance of torrent. There is no need in all those web services and stuff for simple file sharing app.\n\nYes, persistent torrents are more secure, but I'm a bit tired of constantly downloading new versions of games and apps. With ZN-like technology, it would be possible to update clients' files. And client would be able to pin versions he likes (because new versions are more buggy sometimes and may lack of some functions).\n\nI suppose a smart move would be just to add it as a plugin to ZN and solve 2 problems: implement updatable torrents and ZN's large file transfer. But there should be a separate interface to control large files. Storing everything like ZN is doing now is not an option!"

Write them in the comments. Jokes don't have to be new for you, but they may be new for someone who does not speak your language. More of so, they don't have to be very funny, it's stupid to ask someone with a different culture and a background to provide a joke that is funny for you.\n\nThis idea came to me after that –î.–£.–ù.–Ø. (Dunya) thing. If @ks or @erkan are not too busy, they may send the link. The joke is old and not funny in Russia, however it's based on Russian language, so surely it was not translated.\n\nAlso I'm thinking towards native phrases, but may be it's worth another post. This idea came to me today when I was thinking about [\"Russian National Symbol\" joke](http://127.0.0.1:43110/blog.musickiller.bit/?Post:70:Open+Computers+OS#Comments) and someone in the street said \"I'm not made with a finger!\" (–ù–µ –ø–∞–ª—å—Ü–µ–º –¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω!) So I decided to make a page somewhere collecting all Russian phrases about a dick that I could find, so that people would not look like =\\ when I call it Russian National Symbol. Then the idea grow a bit into just collecting not very famous national phrases.\n\nIf you like any of those ideas, feel free to post it here.\n\n##Not_Funny_Stuff\nAh, yea. So that Klaus sould not say \"kids are reading\", I proclaim this post and comments 18+ (and 21+ for countries where the law says so). That does not mean we should not be polite and cultured here, but let's also be open-minded.\n\nAlso since my blog is not very popular, if you like the idea, share the link in your blog. All the ideas in this blog are free and have no copyright for no one, and if there were any rools like copyright here, it would be \"to be redistributed as Free and with no copyright in any iteration, 'copy of a copy' or modification\".

Why do we need NXT if we have NMC already? Can someone create a plugin that will work with NMC's API, checking for the name and giving an answer to the site. This way ZeroID will become a local plugin and there won't be any reppeating names!\n\nGood news is that this thing should be checked only once in a while, so a \"key\" for the site can be used on devices that don't have NMC client installed!\n\nActually I have 2 reasons to propose this:\n- Unlike NXT, NMC is used already\n- As far as I undertand, when names expire they get deleted from the blockchain => less weight of the chain itself.

Wich is very nice when you have several accounts or want to send a mesage through the network.\n\n## What I disliked:\n\n- It's not a clone of BTC: wich means it may contain bugs and vulnurabilities beyond BTC's. Comunity is on guard, but still it is something to take into consideration.\n- It's fast. And I'm afraid that it means that the blockchain is growing fast to."

Ok, here is the full story:\n\nI've reached the 10k limit several times, and several times I tried doferent ways to extend it. Every time I changed content.json inside site's users folder.\n\nFirst time I tried to sign it with zeronet siteSign. Failed. Visual counter updated, limit was not extended.\n\nSecond time I tried to sign it with the buttom in the side pannel. Failed. Then nofish told me that I've just done it wrong: should have designated what content.json have I wanted to sign.\n\nThird time (why do I call that a bug) I did it all right, signed with a side pannel, designated a right way before signing. PC's ZeroNet updated it right. I could post comments up to 11 kb (did not want to write more trash), but now I write this post from tablet, because I've discovered that I can't write any comments from it. A limit here is still on 10k. I dunno what to do. Will report it on Talk yesterday.\n\nStill going to bed now.\n\nGood night everyone!"

But I'm not sure if it should be free. Namecoin is great because to maintain a name you have to pay a small summ. I think that should be true here, because this name has to be stored, and disc storage in decentralized system is not as cheap as it is on a common server.\n##Authorization\n- A common site: client makes 0 coin transaction on an address, provided by site, and in the tranzaction, some secret key (or simply computer address?) is stored that a site gives to a client. Secret key is needed because several computers may require an authorization at the same time and the key would show which computer is a real one.\nWhen succeded, site authorizes client and remembers his computer (with a cookie?). There is a transaction fee, because someone has to process this authorization. But it is low enough that a client can use the service once or even several times (extra security = extra money) a day if needed.\n\n- A site with a monthly fee: client makes N coin transaction (defined by the site)... and everything else is just the same!\n# Why is that better\n- Unlike common authorization services, it's impossible to guess client's password.\n- It's a fully distributed authorization service.\n\n#My questions:\n- Can any existing coin system be used?\n- That means, can any system send 0.0 coin transaction?\n- And can this system send extra info (secret key) if needed.\n\n#Good answers:\n- <a target='_BLANK' href='https://ipfs.pics/QmZGFibFpQWmHGQTeij3oDJxKVDmWVKyXYG5R2359JqgeR'><img src='https://ipfs.pics/ipfs/QmZGFibFpQWmHGQTeij3oDJxKVDmWVKyXYG5R2359JqgeR' alt=\"Some IPFS.pics problems.

Tips and Tricks\n- usually you can replace stuff like \"zeronet.py\" with \"z*\", but because there is \"zeronet.pyc\", I don't do that. Correct me if I'm stupid ^_^\n- you can run previous commands with \"volume button\"+\"w\" even after reboot. Awesome. Linux rulez!\n- Debian need not your childish sudo! Just do it as a real SuperUser!\n- I could not create symbolic links on Android, so I did it like I wrote it here. (tar says \"can't create symbolic links\")\n- on startup (and after adding several new sites) wait for several minutes while all your sites get updated. Don't use zeronet, or it will be very laggy and sites will get \"timeout\" error.\n\n#5. Other use<s>less</s>full info\n\n- no it does not eat ALL the battery. On the phone (yes, I did that on the phone too!) it's not notisable, on the tablet... a bit. May be it's not coz of ZN. I had troubles like that before.\n- no it does not take all CPU or memory. Very kind to those ones actually\n- no it does not eat all your traffic. My 70 MB/day are MUCH more than enough for ZN + other browsing + apps. If you don't belive me, sync at home and work, and use it without network when on the move (don't, it's stupid) =) However, I only tested that with few sites on the phone, I still sync tablet at home. But I plan to test it with \"full power\" some day. Tested? comment here or write me on the mail so that I add more info!\n- yes, it's pretty cool, but don't share it with your stupid friends that ask \"what for did you do this?\" (I forgot what I wanted to write here, but this will do))))\n- you CAN'T drag \"0\" button. Or I can't.. May be you'll find a way?? To post stuff you have to edit site's properties to \"own\": \"true\" in a text editor.\n- benchmarks showing how sucky python is on a droid (trust me it's not that bad xD) http://127.0.0.1:43110/blog.musickiller.bit/?Post:40:New+blog+post\n\n- we need to make this guide better, help me! Also translate it to other languages. And to Russian too, they won't let me be in peace if someone won't do that..."

Just imagine: You open your eyes and you are 7 minutes early and all you think is \"oh, sure 7 minutes is enough for a good healthy sleep!\" So you close your eyes and just as you do that, you are awoken by an alarm. You think \"Now it feels much better! Now it is my second alarm and it's the perfect time to get up!\" You look at the clock and \"Oh fuck! It's my third alarm! I'm 30 minutes late! Then you blink, just to get that sleepyness out of your head, to water your eyes, and bam! It's your fourth alarm clock, and it's 1,5 hour too late!\n\nSo today I have sit up in the bed, tired of being angry about something that happens almost every single day, took my phone to see what classes have I missed and what else won't harm to miss (the usual thing), saw that today is a bad day to miss anything (the unusual thing)... saw that I'm actually 2,5 hours late... Why does it have to be this way?\n\nOh, I do remember time when I would get up just before my first alarm, and be glad that I am awake and eager to live through the day. When I was glad to see everyone and know that I do have a purpose... Every time I fall (or better say \"throw myself\", because I really do that intentionally) in love, everything is so much easier! I don't even get up - I awake sitting in my bed, staring at the watch, counting every second. And even if I do lay down again, it's not because I'm sleepy or tired, it's because I'm so overwhelmed by emotions that I can't stand or even sit straight!\n\nI miss that feeling. It was too long since the last time. Just as I predicted, I did not fall those last two times. It's good, it was not worth it, but it's also bad. Every time it's over, it is as if someone unplugs a power cable. I know I have a lot of power on my batteries and it won't harm to stay on my own for some time, to re-evaluate what happened, rethink everythink, recalculate, to make it better next time. But eventually, and always too soon, I run out of energy and everyday I wake up with more and more sad emotions and thoughts in my head. Or even worse, sometimes it's not sadness, but emptiness. A clean vacuum that (*looks at the time*)... well... sucks.\n\nSorry, I don't have enough time. I'm 3.5 hours late and counting. Counting too fast. May be I'll finish it later. I still hope I won't. Hope it get's better sooner.\n\nDamn, I hope my sister won't read it coz she needs a support now, not this... Good news ZeroNet is not exactly the same thing as internet and you can't just stumble on this page.. May be that's why I'm here?"

I've decided to split this thing into 2 posts (at least before I move it somewhere) because due to gigantic fonts in this blog, it's easier for me to edit this post this way.\n\n## 4. Write a post with video tag\n\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/htmL/html5_video.asp\nhttp://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp\n\nsource 1: http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/[hash]\nsource 2: http://ipfs.io/ipfs/[hash]\nsource 2: http://ipfs.pics/ipfs/[hash]\n\n\n(I'm posting it like that so that ppl can start, I will add more info and tricky parts a <s>bit</s> later)\n\nPlease tell me if you find any errors! Thanks!\n\n# Browser Addon\nUse it to redirect all links leading to gateways to your local IPFS instance.\n(VERY USEFUL!) (works for pictures in this blog)\nhttps://github.com/lidel/ipfs-firefox-addon\n\n# ToDo:\n- problems with sharing download links to videos (and files) through ipfs.io\n- <s>finish \"windows\" part.</s> DONE!\n- change \"mac\" part to something different. May be.\n- read questions ppl ask and write answers both in comments and in blog posts. (it's the cool part. I'm needed. And smart! ^_^ awesome!)))\n- tricks about using IPSF, like <s>browser addon</s> and smth else that I forgot now"

			"body": "<s>// will be moved as well</s> not worth it\n## 1. Save Space\nAs you all know, sites on ZeroNet are shared between all users who access them. I'm not sure how not essential files work, so let's assume that all of the files are shared between all the users. That would mean that if you visit a blog to read some news, you would also need to DL all the data the site contains. Multipage sites are not popular on ZN, so you will have to DL all the content as soon as you enter the first page.\nBut in case of IPFS, you can specify what files to pin and what files will be automaticly deleted.\n\n## 2. Save YOUR Space\nIn case of IPFS, you may decide to store NO data at all and use gateways provided for free. Ofcourse it harms decentralization and costs some power to those who host gateways, but this way you can watch films on your phone if you want to.\n\n## 3. The same thing actually\nYes, to tell you the truth if creators of ZeroNet solve the problem with big files, there will be no need for IPFS here. But until then, you don't really have a choice ;D\n\n## 4. DAG\nThe algorithm used in IPFS pervents the creation of copies of a same file. If a user is trying to upload a file that already exists on IPFS, it will be merged. (How awesome is that?!!)\n\n# What I think\nI think that guys should unite. ZN has great dynamic file sharing technology, IPFS is good at large static file transfer. Work together guys! Let's build that decentralized net you were talking about together! =D"

			"body": "I've fixed the blog and I think it's time to tell you my understandment of what has happened here.\n\nI belive it to be a bug: when user data limit is reached (see that little numbers near your comments? they have a tooltip!),  he is temporary banned, until he eraces enough messages to be back under limit. Problem with my case was that the last comment I wrote was huge. And I suppose that caused a bug: site rejected my auth_key and I could not even delete my old comments.\n\nSo if you ever get close to that 10 kb limit, tell me, I'll add some more space for you. The reason I got there so fast is... My emotional intability? Anyway, I post too much separate small comments. And because each comment is a json line with all the data like what post it's from and it's number etc., so it really does matter when I post 5 comments with 5 words in each... So I have to find a balance between limiting my freedom of \"SpEeCh\" and my readers' disk space saving.\n\n# How to fix?\n\nThat's easy. As usually I was thinking in the right direction, but lack of skill was too great.\n\n1. Open this file:\n<code> ZeroNet/data/[site]/data/users/content.json</code>\n2. Find this:\n<code>\"permissions\": {\n   \"banexample@zeroid.bit\": false,\n   \"nofish@zeroid.bit\": { \"max_size\": 20000 }</code>\n3. add a user you need, and the limit you wish to grant (don't forget that all the data is stored on every machine!!)\n4. in case you already have the same error I had, either open user's folder / data,json and delete some messages, or just delete user's folder.\n5. Sing  and Share!\n6. Tell others how to do that!! You may give this post's link, I guess =)\n\n# Wanna ask u smth\n\nSo now I lost all my comments... GOTTA WRITE MORE!\nBut!.. in order to find a less temporary solution, I am going to ask you to ask your questions on my zeromail. At least long questions. And surely offtopic questions go to the mail. Commenting posts is ok, it's cool, this way I know you read me, but let's not overdo again ;D\n\n## Tip:\n\nIn your comments youse citation (not only here, everywhere!), a short line or 2 words help in rebuilding a dialog when one user decides to erace his comments."

And that's IF ZeroNet supports files over 1 MB (wich it does AFAIR).\n\nOn the other hand, I could use IPFS. Bad news here is that browser redirect plugin is not working with ZeroNet and I need either to step on my own throat and use ipfs.io or ipfs.pics without relying on ipfs browser plugin (the whole idea of ipfs is destroyed) or to do what I've done in previous post: copy an \"embed\" link from ipfs.pics, modify img src to lead to localhost and add img alt to tell ppl that their ipfs is in trouble, but they can still see the image by clicking on it.\n\nYes.

I wated to add a picture from IFFS network into this blog by embedding it.\n2. For some reason, redirecting plugin does not work here. I don't know why, it just does not. So I decided to make a spoiler that would hide a picture, accessed with ipfs.io and display a picture hosted on 127.0.0.1. That way, a picture would be visible if a viewer had IPFS running and ready to be viewed (in the spoiler) if a user had no IPFS.\n3. I could not find a simple solution like some html tag or markdown tag or smth else, so I've added a script inside a text field.\n4. Damn script worked! Well... Not exactly. It would work if it was a working script. But instead it killed all the scripts on the page that were loaded after text field.\n5. I've tried fixing it by deleting the sctipt from data.json. I forgot that this file (if does not pass checking) is downloaded from other peers. So 3-4 times I've eraced that script again and again until I realised what I should do.\n6. I opened ZeroBlog and looked up how to sign a site from the console. Shut down ZeroNet, edited the script and signed the site.\n7. That's where the fun started! My blog was alright by the time thought I did not know that because due to some bug(?) in ZeroNet I had an old version of the page (cached?) inside Zero. (Yes, I cleaned up browser's cache several times.)\n8. I realised that only after I opened the site in my tablet. *THANKS YOU GUYS FOR SEEDING MY SITE BACK TO ME!!!*\n9. after some dumb \"change that, delete that\", I've deleted the whole site and downloaded it from the network (thanks again!)\n10. I need some time to relax now... It's my first blog and I almost killed it... Just when guys started to say \"ok, I got the link, gonna open it\" and \"I've added your blog to the index\" and stuff like that. Damn stress...\n\nDo I really learn everything the hard way?
