		<ul>
  <li>With fries the Chinese native medicine 
		special-purpose tile medicine pot suffering medicine curative effect to 
		be best; </li>
        <ul>
    <li>Because its child small among is big, this 
		still our ancestor's patent, although of undistinguished appearance, but 
		the completely collection science to a body, the minimum present market 
		so-called modernization automatic tonite pot also makes one, has the 
		model all not to be able to learn in there, is modern people's 
		intelligence quotient does not compare the antiquity person?</li>
    <li>Such structure is extremely perfect: </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Mouth small: Makes the water to be easy to 
		soak the medicine; </li>
      <li>Stomach big: Suitablly holds the medicine 
		(to tolerate world intolerable matter); </li>
      <li>Bottom small: Makes the medicine fluid not 
		to be easy to boil does the water; </li>
      <li>Has the mouth: Causes when the decoction 
		ebullition the medicine fluid cannot overflow, as well as the 
		convenience boils the good medicine to pour; </li>
      <li>Has the lid: The teapot all has the lid, 
		but have not forgotten this is before several millenniums invents, 
		modern people's any patent can pale by comparison;</li>
      <li>Ceramics: The stability is high, also 
		cannot and in the medicine effective component has the chemical change 
		under the high temperature decoction, guarantees drug efficacy which the 
		medicine can display should have;</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>If must also be possible to select the 
		earthenware, the earthenware cooking pot or the glassware; </li>
  <li>Metal household utensils and so on stainless 
		steel, iron hardware, copperware cannot use: </li>
        <ul>
    <li>The Chinese native medicine ingredient is 
		complex, contains has the carbohydrate, the amino acid, the protein, the 
		fat, the wax, the mildew, the plant pigment, the vitamin, the organic 
		acid, the alkaloid, the tannic acid, Gan Lei, the volatile oil, the 
		inorganic element (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, 
		sulfur, chlorine) and the trace element (iron, cobalt, molybdenum, 
		fluorine, bromine, copper, manganese, chromium, idodine, zinc, selenium) 
		and so on, alkaloid must after the tannic acid or the organic acid fresh 
		salifying, can dissolve to the water; </li>
    <li>The chemistry of metals ingredient comparison 
		does not hide decides, the easy command some raw material for medicine 
		like polygonum multiflorums, the gall nut, the root of herbaceous peony, 
		the Chinese rhubarb and so on to contain the tanning substance has the 
		chemical change, produces the ferric tannate and so on the deleterious 
		substance, affects the alkaloid the use; </li>
    <li>Lightly reduces the curative effect, causes 
		property of a medicine to change flavor, changes astringent and changes 
		rank, serious when can bring about taking to be ill;</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Does not suggest the use automatic tonite pot, 
	only if this automatic tonite pot also is the mouth child small among is 
	big, moreover does not have outside the filament or the metal reveals;</li>
    <ul>
  <li>Intending may suggest the 
	factory so produces, follows a model, also is inherits to the traditional 
	culture (has this product, please <a href="001a001c.html">Contact Us</a>).</li>
