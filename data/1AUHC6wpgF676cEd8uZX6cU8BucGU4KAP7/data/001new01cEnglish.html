<ul>
	<li>Use a new ς-energy Paper every 3 days: every Paper can only be used by 1 
	person for 3 days (72 hours), after which it becomes expired;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Effective within 3 days after Paper is folded or start of use, 
		thereafter it becomes expired;<img src="../img/origami.gif" width="245" height="303" align="right" /></li>
		<ul>
			<li>When folding the Paper, make sure that the side with numbers faces 
			outwards (i.e. numbers facing your body); The &#962;-energy paper can be 
			folded into any shape or size to suit the user, however, the paper 
			must not be torn or damaged.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Under no circumstances can the Paper be kept for over 3 days! Discard 
		immediately at expiry date even if there is no new Paper to be used 
		(because it is NOT suitable for our health after that);</li>
	</ul>
	<li>How to use: put Paper inside a pocket that is close to body; for patients 
	who rest in bed, put Paper under the pillow;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Duration for keeping Paper daily: 24 hours continuously; do not take the 
		Paper out unless necessary (can be taken out when having a shower);</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Please note that Paper must NOT be placed in your wallet, in case 
			the dirtiness of money contaminates the Paper;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Print the Paper off directly from the website; 1 page is enough; If the 
		printing is incomplete due to problems of the printer or software, the 
		printed copy still can be used.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Shrinking or change of the printing size is NOT allowed (leave the 
			printed Paper as it is); no editing allowed;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>If interested, you can read the numbers from Paper. You may gain 
		unexpected benefits by doing so;</li>
		<!--
		<li>For those who are simultaneously using multiple copies of Paper (e.g. 1 
		piece in the pocket, 1 piece under the pillow, 1 piece at office, 1 
		piece in the car), payments must be made for the corresponding copies of 
		Paper;</li>
		-->
		<li>Discard used Paper or unused Paper that has exceeded the expiry date immediately; Discard the Paper by tearing it into pieces and throwing into trash can (to prevent others contact the discarded paper) or burn the Paper (beware of fire);</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Prohibit from writing on Paper, including both sides of the Paper;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>It is a normal phenomenon that Paper changes colour, becomes torn, or 
		stinks (due to change of energy field). When this happens, DISCARD the 
		Paper immediately and use a new Paper;</li>
		<li>If Paper is damaged by factors beyond men’s control, e.g. wet by rain or 
		sweat at work, it still remains usable after dried-up (the wears and 
		tears on Paper’s surface or loss of colour do NOT affect the curative 
		effect, because the numbers have already “sunk in”);</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Paper on the website can also be photographed or downloaded by mobile phone 
	– to enable your mobile phone with healthy function, and to possess epochal 
	meaning, this is also a significant milestone and an open challenge!</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Photographing (you may also use portable mini digital camera):</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Set the font of the web browser to the smallest or able to view full 
			screen;</li>
			<li>Turn on Macro function (if this function available); turn off flash 
			lights (otherwise there is a need to adjust the angle to avoid 
			reflection of light that may obstruct the image);</li>
			<li>The image must be clear; try to include the entire image as per 
			printed copy, including the first line (header/title) and those 
			items in “For your attention”;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Downloading (for users whose mobile phone lacks the function of 
		photographing);
		<ul>
			<li>Use computer to save the webpage of Paper as image (PDF, JPG, GIF, 
			BMP…, can be in any format, but must be able to be viewed by your 
			mobile phone); can produce multiple images for multiple person to 
			use (produce the image only at the time of using);</li>
			<li>Transfer the image from computer to mobile phone (via data cable, 
			Bluetooth, infra-red, etc.); each image (transferred to mobile 
			phone) is for use once only (delete the image in computer right 
			away);</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Use: view 5 times or more daily (no need to read carefully; simply scan 
		through the part with numbers); no time limit for viewing and duration 
		between each viewing;</li>
		<li>Attention:
		<ul>
			<li>Transferred image in one mobile cannot be transferred again to another mobile (only computer mobile, mobile mobile is not allowed);</li>
			<li>Starting from the time when the photographing or the downloading takes place, image of Paper in mobile must be deleted after expired 
			(storing Paper in a memory card is the same as printing off the Paper; the only difference is using different media);</li>
			<li>It is highly environmentally friendly (saving paper), convenient for those who are in urgent need, and those who do not have a printer 
			(83% of mobile phones and 92.5% of smart phone can take picture);</li>
			<li>If the user is suffering very serious illness (very bad field), then the mobile could become malfunctioned, please evaluate the value of 
			health against the costs of damaging your mobile (these abnormalities including but not limited to, noisy background, 
			breaking in communication, battery going flat quickly, buttons showing abnormal functions, or malfunction), please refer to 
			Information Need to know for the cause of these abnormalities;</li>
