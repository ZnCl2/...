	MingXuan Reactions do signal the potency and healing 
	effect of our medicine, show the results of the treatment, curative effect of 
	the therapy, normal sensation, healthy response and a symptom of

<p align="right"><a href="/1AUHC6wpgF676cEd8uZX6cU8BucGU4KAP7">1AUHC6wpgF676cEd8uZX6cU8BucGU4KAP7</a></p>
    
	<p>
	
	When you have the MingXuan reactions, the right attitude is: take things as 
	they come, let it be and bear the reactions calmly without excessive 
	expectations.</p>
	<p>
	
	Any response that occurs after going through our TCM (Traditional Chinese 
	Medicine) treatment is normal reaction (including subsequent reactions), it 
	is the fundamental difference that distinguishes TCM from Western medicine.
	</p>
	<p>
	
	In terms of medicinal guides only, which work in guiding the property of a 
	medicine to reach the merisdians and internal organs where pathologic changes 
	occur, TCM leads Western medicine by as many as five thousand years. Judging 
	from this fact, we know that Western medicine cannot compare with TCM, not 
	to mention numerous profound TCM ideas. For instance, TCM advocates the 
	philosophy of "nipping in the bud";, which means guarding against the bidding 
	of any disease or stopping any illness at its nascent stage. This is the 
	greatest medical concept, enough to defeat Western medicine.</p>
	<p>
	
	MingXuan reactions are the very evidence for the efficacy of our treatment! 
	The recovery of Qi (a basic TCM concept, synonymous with "vital energy";) is 
	the sign of effectiveness! This is what we are proud of and where our 
	features lie. When our medicine arrives at the root cause of a disease, the 
	patient will surely feel uncomfortable or even painful, something like "it 
	is the darkest before dawn";.</p>
	<p>
	
	According to an ancient Chinese book <i>Shang Shu' Yue Ming (Part I)</i>, 
	"If no MingXuan reactions occurs after the medicine is taken, then the root of 
	disease is not eliminated and the disease is not cured";. The reactions 
	incurred after medicine administration are also known as "reverse reaction";, 
	"adjustment reaction";, "healthy reaction";, "immune reaction"; or "MingXuan 
	reaction";. All those responses are the effects of promoting human body's 
	self-healing ability, cell regeneration of internal organs and activating 
	the transmission mechanism of meridians. Such reactions are inevitable 
	metabolism necessary for radical cure.</p>
	<p>
	
	According to TCM, "reverse reaction"; is the very evidence for an effective 
	prescription, and by nature it is an appropriate and active response, but 
	not a warning response. It shows the efficacy of prescription or treatment 
	in stimulating the patient's natural healing ability, it helps a patient to 
	recuperate and promote cell metabolism to sufficient oxygen and nutrients.
	</p>
	<p>
	
	There is a popular TCM notion that "you are not recovering if no MingXuan 
	reaction appears";. "MingXuan reaction"; is not a side effect but a natural 
	phenomenon that comes up during effective conditioning for human body 
	organs. It shows the fight of body potential energy (vital Qi) against 
	pathogenic factors with the aid of medicine, and the patient will eventually 
	turn for the better. Just like flood protection method employed by Da Yu (an 
	ancient Chinese expert in flood control), MingXuan reaction is a good 
	physiological phenomenon that pathogenic factors and toxins are being 
	channeled off and removed from human body. But if pathogenic factors and/or 
	toxins are not completely removed, the disease or illness will come back 
	someday, although the disease symptoms already seem to be suppressed and the 
	patient already appears to get better. It is something like "if weeds are 
	cut without their roots dug up, they will grow again".</p>
	<p>
	
	During therapy, some symptoms similar to previous ones but not exactly the 
	same or those which have never been experienced, may appear in the affected 
	parts. Moreover, <b>the intensity of reactions may be automatically adjusted 
	according to individual tolerance</b> and such treatment is quite humane, 
	highly bio-intelligent and bio-automatic. If necessary, the reactions may 
	automatically stop or weaken (e.g. if you are to meet an important guest, a 
	running nose will automatically stop; if you are driving a car, pains in 
	your hands and feet will automatically decrease to a tolerable extent), so 
	the reactions vary from people to people. ------There is no need to worry, 
	for your health will improve after you get over those reactions. As a rule, 
	former symptoms may appear more serious in therapy. For example, if you have 
	rhinallergosis, you may sneeze and snivel more after treatment; and formerly 
	latent problems or symptoms tend to aggravate and make you even more 
	uncomfortable, such as asthma, gout or qualm.</p>
	<p>There are some people who might worry whether their conditions will worsen. 
	Of course not, unlike western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine never 
	affects normal tissue and aggravates patient conditions. In fact, it helps 
	control the state of an illness and cures the patient. Chinese medicine will 
	automatically classify and search for the root cause of disease, and in 
	accordance with the severity of illness, it will control the root cause 
	first for light illness, and control the symptoms first for serious illness, 
	with appropriate attention to both root causes and symptoms. The whole 
	process is automatic and programmed without aggravating patients' conditions 
	or affecting patients' somatic function and internal organs.</p>
<p>Keeping a right attitude is essential! Don't complain or make a fuss and do 
	keep calm. If you curve and fold a rubber hose, water will not pass through, 
	water pressure in one part will increase, the hose will swell, and the 
	folded part will be forced to spread out again if the water pressure reaches 
	a certain degree, and then the whole pressure in the hose will return to 
	normal after the water passes through the folded part. As people fall ill, 
	the meridian and collateral will be blocked just like a folded water hose. 
	Our body will defend such disease naturally by trying to open the blocked 
	meridian and collateral, so patients may feel pain, uncomfortable, or catch 
	a fever. If your immune system can't defeat the disease, external assistance 
	is required and TCM is there to help you. If the blocked meridian and 
	collateral is clear, patients will recover from disease and the pain and 
discomfort will just disappear.</p>
	<p>
	
	It is not adverse reaction, or side effect! Never compare it to side effect 
	of Western medicine (If you can't bear such uncomfortable feelings, diseases 
	will not be expelled out, and your chance of recuperation will be slimmer).
	</p>
	<p>
	
	Such feelings indicate that the therapy is right for the disease and begins 
	to take effect. Chinese medicine works in a similar way as "recovery of qi"; 
	in acupuncture (During acupuncture, if the patient gets the sense of needle 
	or qi, it shows that the therapy is effective). When the medicine is right 
	for the symptom and disease, it will come to the affected part and work to 
	treat the symptoms. By then, the recovery is not far away. This is the 
	ultimate level of traditional Chinese medicine and where we take pride.</p>
	<p>
	
	The momentary feelings are indeed somewhat uncomfortable. But if such 
	uncomfortable feelings can bring us thorough recovery, it will be worthy. 
	Pupation must be bitter, but a butterfly will be attractive and can fly and 
	dance in the sky after exuviation.</p>
	<p>
	
	TCM therapy usually appears in a wavelike form (similar to three-dimensional 
	spiral type; it seems like repetition, but it is not merely repetition), 
	emphasizing on the harmony between man and nature. In case of light illness, 
	one "wave"; (one run) will control patients' conditions, otherwise several 
	waves and impulsions are necessary. It is not difficult to find there are 
	interspaces and wave troughs between wave crests, the width and depth 
	depending on individual capability and adaptive faculty. For serious 
	illness, we apply great and thorough therapy, for light illness, a few of 
	little action will be effective. To be specific, it can be divided in three 
	stages including massive adjustment, fine adjustment and micro adjustment: 
	massive adjustment is drastically conducted at the first stage, and patients 
	usually will have obvious feelings; in fine adjustment stage, patients 
	usually will have few feelings or no feelings; in micro adjustment, patients 
	usually will be unaware of the therapy. Human body has a complex and 
	intricate internal structure, so different patients have different 
	susceptibilities and sensations. The sensations may be very simple or 
	complicated. Therefore, the patient need not pay too much attention to the 
	sensations. Do not worry whether the treatment can cure your disease when 
	you do not have particular feelings. When you are healthy or not very well, 
	do you pay attention to heartbeat or breath? This is also true of our 
	therapy. During lesion or TCM treatment, the patient might not experience or 
	feel all changes to some organs. If you can immediately know which part of 
	your body is wrong or does not work, you have no need to consult the doctor. 
	With or without sensations, TCM therapy still works. Do not forget that TCM 
	is a high-level medical system and prevails over any modern medical science.</p>

	Principles of medicine reaching the affected area (response to TCM 
	treatment):</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Spiral type: an automatic process that rotates continuously in a 
		DNA-like type with rising vital qi and falling foul qi (the health 
		gradually comes back, while the illness gradually abates);
		<ul>
			<li>This function is similar to the working of cilia of cells at 
			internal wall of our trachea. Capable of rhythmical motion, the 
			cilia clears away foreign matters and sputa without affecting our 
			respiration.</li>
			<li>It is the quintessence of traditional Chinese medicine, but we need 
			not have our therapy patented (we have our own self-protection 
			mechanism). Those profit-seekers have no way to understand and 
			master our treatment;</li>
			<li>This is where the greatness of our Chinese culture lies. This is a 
			good weapon against the ridiculous notion that TCM theories shall be 
			discarded while continuing the use of herbal medicine.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Different severity and sequence of priority:
		<ul>
			<li>After treatment, the sequence of morbid changes may remain 
			unchanged, but the severity will decline with each therapy.
			<ul>
				<li><b>
				123456789</b> 
			  =&gt; 123456789</li>
			</ul>
		  <li>More often than not, the sequence of priority will change. Formerly 
			light illness will exit the stage, but the previously lighter 
			illness might become a major threat. Major contradiction turns into 
			a secondary contradiction, while some secondary contradictions may 
			disappear. Some other contradictions will become secondary 
			contradictions (small problems are eliminated in the first round of 
			treatment);
			<ul>
				<li><b>
				123456789</b> 
			  =&gt; 34689ABCD</li>
			</ul>
		  <li>Sometimes major contradiction change into a secondary contradiction, 
			while a secondary contradiction becomes a major contradiction. This 
			often occurs in a critical case. By this time we shall concentrate 
			on major contradiction by containing the symptoms of a desperate 
			illness.

	Common feelings or sensations after using our threapy (inexhaustive 
	enumeration):</p>
<ol>
	<li>Cancers or 
	malignant diseases;</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>Patients may feel that the meridians is moving irregularly, and warm 
			waves are running up and down (meridians system in patient with 
			malignant disease is normally seriously damaged);
		<ul>
			<li>If you have the similar feelings after taking our therapy, it 
				indicates that you have weathered a crisis!</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>You may have a stinging feeling in focus (e.g. liver cancer, kidney 
			cancer, and lung cancer), red tendon and much discharge in the eyes, 
			and the color of your urine may look like strong tea...</li>
		<li>Patient may get a fever, which is beneficial to human immunity;
	  </li>
		<li>Western medicine focuses on reducing tumor size with medicine, but 
			the patient even may die when the tumors become smaller; during TCM 
			therapy, tumors may not shrink or even grow larger, while patients 
			can still live safe and sound, which is not rare. Why!</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Leukemia: 
	Often accompanied by green tears...</li>
	<li>'Liver 
	cancer: Stings in flank, especially in left side, and the emotion changes 
	easily...</li>
	<li>'AIDS: 
	symptoms of cold, distended feeling in hands, foot and the whole body, 
	exanthem appearing in the skin next day, ..., boils appearing and purulence in 
	toes and sole of foot, and other relevant symptoms for patients with other 
	kind of cancers or diseases at the same time;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>CD4 is only the index for Western medicine in judging resistance, 
			which can't truly reflect patients' immunity. It is limited and 
			partial, unreliable and worthless. There is no need to pay any 
			attention (including other medical examinations)! </li>
		<li>During clinical work, we often find very funny cases: AIDS patients 
			will remain vigorous, and work after having TCM therapy, although 
			the results of Western medicine analysis fail to reach the standard 
			indexes; The patients accepting Western medicine therapy, though 
			their results of the analysis seem better and CD4 is slowly 
			increasing, are always feeling listless and inert, they can't work 
			and live normally, even the whole conditions are declining, and the 
			patients have to give up treatment at last, for they are too weak, 
			even approaching to the end of their lives(e.g. some kinds of 
			antibiotics effective on culture medium may prove ineffective for 
			patients, but Western doctors fail to explain this contradiction.)
		</li>
		<li>In Chinese medicine, meridians including lung, large intestine etc. 
			is used as remedy index. TCM therapy helps better the holistic 
			immunity system. The category of holistic immunity of TCM includes 
			CD4, 5, 6 ... in Western medicine;</li>
		<li>When using TCM therapy, we shall observe in TCM views, and diagnose 
			in TCM methods (just like you can't evaluate western food with 
			standards for Chinese food, and you can't order Chinese dishes with 
			a menu for western food), un-sound views and examining methods in 
			Western medicine shall not be used here; for example, calcification 
			points of phthisis represent the past condition but mean nothing for 
			the current conditions (it is true of many other circumstances, such 
			as hepatitis, liver cancer, cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar 
			and so on. So we need to reevaluate these indexes objectively for 
			new conditions).</li>
		<li>In fact, Chinese medicine is very simple, it emphasizing on golden 
			mean and balance. In other words, TCM aims to improve the body's 
			immunity to fight diseases in a natural way. So TCM is easier to 
			earn and manage than Western medicine; with its own systematic 
			diagnosis system, TCM don't need any HIV test. The supplementary 
			means in Western medicine including electrocardiogram, X-ray, CT 
			etc. have become the main means or even money-making means in recent 
			20 years, so angels in white (doctors and nurses) are angels for 
			money.</li>
		<li>In the eyes of a true TCM doctor, there are only patients and 
			healthy people without distinguishing hepatitis B patients from AIDS 
			patients (such a differentiation was only made by Western medicine 
			about one hundred years ago)!, otherwise he is not a true TCM 
			doctor. TCM medical system already became mature nearly few thousand 
			years ago. Maybe things will be different for a TCM doctor trained 
			in Western medical system.</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Intestinal cancer: vomit or excrete green waste matters
	<ul>
		<li>Greenish waste matter indicates an early stage, while deep green 
			shows a severe stage ,with dark green for a critical stage (of 
			course, those waste matters show that the conditions were gone, and 
			it is important to spew or evacuate the root causes of the disease);</li>
		<li>The days prior to the vomit or evacuation are the ones of treatment, 
			and the days following the vomit or evacuation are the ones of 
			recuperation. Such reaction is a watershed and a red letter day for 
			rebirth;</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Patient who underwent surgical operation: flare, fever or pain may 
		reappear at the affected part;</li>
  <li>Heart disease: pulsation over the body, which represents the working of 
		medicine in regulating and supplying vital qi to the heart;
	<ul>
		<li>Suffocating pain in chest and upper abdomen, palpitation, sore and 
			painful tongue ...</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Hepatobiliary diseases: hepatic governs the sinew. Irregular motion or 
		spasm of the muscle shows the working of medicine in promoting the 
		movement of qi and blood in liver meridian;
	<ul>
		<li>Qualm, eye pain and lachrymation, irritability, getting angry for no 
			reason ..., the patient needs to contain his/her temper;</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Spleen governs the flesh: muscle twitch represents the working of 
		medicine in stimulating the movement of qi and blood in spleen meridian;
	<ul>
		<li>Dog tired, very sleepy;</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Respiratory diseases: lung governs the skin. The feelings of worm 
		creeping, itching or irregular air movement indicate the functioning of 
		medicine in promoting the movement of qi and blood in lung meridian;
	<ul>
		<li>Sore throat and feeling hot ... 
		</li>
	</ul>
  <li>'Kidney 
	disease: kidney governs the bone. Bone joints rattling and erection in 
	motion indicate that the medicine improves kidney energy;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Kidney failure patients: often feel tired and don't want to move. 
			After several rounds of TCM treatment, the kidney function will be 
			better;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Ren 
	channel disease: damp syndrome/morbid qi can exude from shoe bottom, and 
	leave damp shoeprint on the ground...</li>
	<li>'Urinary 
	bladder disease: patients sweat without the effect of environmental 
	temperature, even in air conditioned room or in snowing weather...</li>
	<li>'Genital 
	system disease:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Females often feel painful distension in lower abdomen and chest 
			region, and amount of menses seems abnormal, including secretion, 
			color, and odor... </li>
		<li>Males often feel painful distension in lower abdomen, perineum and 
			lumbar region ...</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Internal 
	injury, traumatic injury, rheumatoid disease, rheumatism, and gout: common 
	symptoms include pain, torpor, swelling, or localized skin ulceration ...</li>
	<ul>
		<li>It is the obstruction that causes the pain. Whenever the meridians 
			is blocked or is about to smooth, patients will feel painful (100% 
			is effective theoretically);</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Epilepsy: 
	patients feel stuffy and heavy in head, and phlegm (yellow and thick in the 
	morning, and white in the afternoon)..., thin phlegm indicates recovery;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>During therapy, previous symptoms may appear and don't worry about 
			it;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Mental 
	disease: patients may cough out or vomit out thick phlegm (phlegmatic 
	nodules, usually white), which indicate the disease is cured;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>During therapy, previous symptoms may appear and don't worry about 
			it;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Cataract: 
	patients may feel itchy and caligo, and gradually regain vision ...</li>
	<li>'Patients 
	from the same region or ethnic group may have the same feelings or symptoms, 
	such as yellow and swell. The reason is that they suffer from the same 
	disease;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>In case of swelling/puffiness, the patients may have problems with 
			corresponding meridians, and such symptoms will disappear after 
			recovery;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'The 
	physical indexes, which the higher will be higher while the lower will be 
	lower, may fluctuate and later return to normal values. With the help of TCM, our body begins to recover and take over the functions previously 
	restricted or replaced by Western medicine. So during this process, our body 
	will need some time to readapt its own recovery function, and during the 
	beggeing, it will have some positive feedback or negative feedback, then be 
	in full adaptation, and recovery. Then our body will no longer need Western 
	medicine.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Diabetes: blood sugar will increase, fluctuate, and become normal at 
			last; patients will further emaciate; sexual commerce is prohibited 
			during therapy;</li>
	  <li>Hypertension: blood pressure will increase, fluctuate, and become 
			normal at last. 
		<ul>
			<li>Pulse condition will obviously improve after taking two pieces 
				of dietary recipes; patients will feel bloated face and dilated 
				eyes, or itching hands and body;</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Hypotension: blood pressure will decrease, fluctuate, and become 
			normal at last; </li>
		<li>Alopecia: the symptom will deteriorate, fluctuate, and eventually 
			return to normal (due to promoted metabolism, lifeless hairs fall 
			off and then healthy hairs grow. Such progress is just like the 
			growth of milk teeth);</li>
		<li>Patients with fever: body temperature will increase. Fever helps us 
			strengthen our resistance against disease. So if the temperature is 
			not too high, fever does us no harm. At the moment, patients shall 
			rest in bed and decrease consumption of physical ability (if 
			children's body temperature exceeds 39.5°C, wipe their neck, armpit, 
			thigh root, chest, feet and hands with alcohol or cover such places 
			with ice bag);</li>
		<li>SARS: usually accompanied by fever, chest pain, a feeling like lid 
			opening and closing in throat...</li>
		<li>Cough: patients may cough more. Coughing is the just way for our 
			body to discharge unnecessary secretion which will not be eliminated 
			for months or years if the body's resistance is not strong enough. 
			After take TCM medicine, such secretion will be discharged 
			(typically, sputum nuclear), which indicates the recovery. At this 
			moment, cough remedy to stop it will impede natural adjustment of 
			the organism; </li>
		<li>Parkinson's disease: the affected limbs will gain strength in the 
			about fourth day with reduced shaking and sticky slobber. And later, 
			the affected limbs fluctuate between sthenia and adynamia till 
			recovery...</li>
		<li>Cancer indexes: the indexes may fluctuate or increase (they are only 
			indexes and views for doctors engaging in Western medicine and mean 
			the different in TCM medicine. Furthermore, these indexes help 
			nothing for patients, and always cancers are discovered only at the 
			end stage);</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Stroke, hemiplegia or pamplegia: after treatment, the patient will 
		experience uncontrollable but short-term movement of local muscle 
		joints, or even run quickly subconsciously and cannot stop without 
		grabbing a tree nearby ...
	<ul>
		<li>In reality, bodily movement is jointly controlled by two different 
			systems, i.e., subconscious conditioned reflex and brain nerve 
			center. The subconscious reacts quicker than the brain. It works 
			without any need to report any stimulus to the brain for processing. 
			So the patient's subconscious tends to recover faster, while the 
			brain nerve center fails to act in unison with the subconscious; 
			such out-of-step phenomenon will gradually disappear with the 
			recovery of brain nerve center in a couple of days.</li>
	</ul>
  <li>Sore head and pus-running feet: apart from a sarcastic curse (referring 
		to a sneaky person who is rotten from head to foot, bad in the extreme), 
		it is also a true description of the reactions after our treatment! It 
		is a wise TCM therapeutic method:
	<ul>
		<li>For any critical patient who suffers from malignant boils on head, 
			wound infection or intractable high fever, or any lesion in other 
			parts of the body, the patient may be so treated to excrete toxic 
			substances from Yongquan acupuncture point at the sole of foot. Even 
			an egg-size pustule will come up at Yongquan point and the heat will 
			soon disappear. The next day the pustule will break and a large 
			amount of smelly dark green pus. The patient will recuperate on the 
			seventh day (seven is the figure of termination);</li>
		<li>This therapy is also effective in curing craniocerebral injury and 
			intracranial hypertension. Surgical operations are not needed to 
			treat such patients.</li>
		<li>Laogong acupuncture point in the center of palm, Jing acupuncture 
			points at the end of fingers and toes, or acupuncture points related 
			to the disease are also helpful in inducing the said reactions;</li>
	</ul>
  <li><b>
	The reactions of sufferers of other diseases are not enumerated here, 
		but the basic principles are the same: </b>
	all reactions are the prelude to rebirth and recovery. Most patients who 
		receive our treatment have the following sensations or symptoms:
  <ul>
		<li>Pruritus, pain, rash, chicken pox, fester, petechia, yawn, sneeze, 
			cough and other symptoms similar to cold (all these are benign 
			reactions) ...
		<ul>
			<li>As a rule, you feel extremely itching before your wound heals. 
				So you will understand that itching is the signal of recovery.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Sweat, nasal mucus, tears, phlegm, saliva, abnormal feces and urine 
			(color, shape, stench, diarrhea, or quantity and frequency)...
		<ul>
			<li>Characteristics of diarrhea: as a rule, in normal case, 
				the patient will feel general weakness after several occurrences 
				of diarrhea. But during MingXuan Reations, the above feeling of 
				weakness after few times diarrhea will not happen, and tenesmus 
				symptom will also not have here.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Local heat: the principle is similar to heat generation by heating 
			wire of electric cooker during power connection. The electric 
			resistance there is high, while ordinary wires do not generate heat. 
			Pyrexia at cervical vertebra or scapula is often related to heart 
			trouble, and other heats varies from area to area are in terms of 
			its cause.</li>
		<li>Some patients feel chilly after treatment. The reason is because of 
			the heavy cold evil or cold Qi in their bodies, the the TCM is 
			helping the body to expell them;</li>
		<li>To sum up, the point of the body where you feel uncomfortable is 
			generally where the cause of your disease lies. So you may deduce 
			where your trouble used to be by knowing where you feel 
			uncomfortable;
		<ul>
			<li>The reactions of our patients differ from side effects of 
				chemotherapy and radiotherapy applied in Western medicine;</li>
			<li>Our patients may sense discomfort, annoyance, even pain and 
				agony brought by each reaction and shock. But their sensations 
				are totally different from those caused by diseases/injuries. 
				Their pain or agony contains and brings the comfort, happiness 
				and hope ...</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Different people may fall down with different diseases, while 
			different patients will have different reactions. The same disease 
			will react differently at different times and stage - health will 
			recover when conditions are ripe;
		<ul>
			<li>Take the disease seriously strategically and take it easy 
				tactically (Just hard work caring nothing about the gains- 
				comply with the directions for our TCM usage and then take the 
				reactions as they come);</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Lighter taste: it indicates that the meridian imbalance in your body 
			is rectified. With sensitive receptors, human body tends to adjust 
			(through the brain's control center) the category and taste of the 
			foods (the diet and the taste of a pregnant woman differs from her 
			ordinary foods and taste, because various elements are necessary for

			diet is also an important source for such elements for a fetus). In 
			addition, the doctrine of the mean is also manifested here;</li>
		<li>For more information, you may refer to 
		<u>meridian diagnosis and 
			typical symptoms</u>;
		<ul>
			<li>The degree of MingXuan reaction varies from person to person. It 
				is in direct proportion to the extent of imbalance. 
				Hypercorrection is not necessarily a derogatory term;</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
  <li>For some products such as 
	<u>Employee Quality Function Series</u>: after 
		using of our TCM, some employees may exhibit unusual negative reaction 
		(such as disobedience). Never mind. This is his true color. They used 
		to suppress and hide their true self, and they will turn for the better 
		after releasing their ego. A fault confessed is half redressed. After 
		treatment, they tend to act and think in one and the same way;</li>
  <li>The reaction of medicine arriving at the affected site is not necessarily 
		reflected on the patient;
	<ul>
		<li>For some patients who have received our TCM therapy, the reactions 
			might occur to their children, who undergo discomfort or even agony 
			instead of their parents. Therefore, those patient may not 
			experience the pain when their meridians are about to smooth during 
			TCM treatment;</li>
		<li>There are many responses and symptoms inexplicable to common sense ...</li>
		<li>Therefore, mobilize all initiatives and resources available, 
			including good wishes and blessings. The patient shall use our 
			product, and relatives and friends of the patient may also try on 
			the product (if they are willing to bear or reduce the patient's 
			distress) so as to strengthen the function and energy field of our 
			product and show their filial piety and love (including working 
			personnel who attend to the patient). We always respect people who 
			have filial piety and a loving heart. In addition, our TCM products 
			also help prevent all diseases, including infectious and hereditary 
			ones for those peaple.</li>
	</ul>
  <li>'Pregnant 
	women: the reactions will be more severe than those pregnant women who 
	haven't taken our medicine. Because during optimizing process, corresponding 
	adjustment takes place, which means the fetuses are different from others. 
	So it is a good thing, so there is no need to worry about it. For the sake 
	of your baby, do keep calm; </li>
	<li>'If the 
	products (such as &#962;-energy paper, &#962;-energy prescription, &#962;-energy chant) 
	change color, are broken or smell badly during the use, it shows you have a seriouse health problem (must replace it with a new product). But it is a 
	good signal and do not worry (if no such change occurs afterward, then it 
	means the big trouble is removed. Of course you continue to use the product 
	for consolidation);</li>
	<ul>
		<li>We present these next-generation hi-tech health products with high 
			intelligence and return to innocence and nature at the same time. 
			The function of any such product will dazzle great modern 
			scientists;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'For more 
	examples, refer to<u> typical cases and personal experience or our BBS</u></li>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have taken our medicine, you're welcome to share your 
			personal experience with us at
			<a href="https://www.duosuccess.com/bbs">www.duosuccess.com/bbs</a> and 
			let more people know about our ancient TCM;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>We might 
	presume that science is equal to superstition! Superstition means believing 
	in what you don't understand. How much do you know about science? That we 
	believe in science we don't understand is superstition itself;</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>There are superstition and superstition, but they are different. 
			Some so-called superstitions are valuable experiences passed down 
			from generation to generation in the times without computers and 
			Internet, including Fengshui in Chinese architecture, Guasha (skin 
			scraping) in TCM and the pregnant women can not raise their hands 
			over head or move bed, etc.
		<ul>
			<li>It is totally wrong to regard Chinese traditional culture as 
				feudal superstition. We need to change such a misconception.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>If you are carsick, you will be comfortable after vomiting jaundice 
			water or food residue. Otherwise, you may be more uncomfortable or 
			dizzy (it is wind evil in the view of TCM);
		<ul>
			<li>Modern scientists will never believe or understand that wind 
				evil can be vomited out in such a method, and they deem it 
				unscientific, because there are no such kinds of knowledge in 
				Western medicine. People think what scientists can't understand 
				must be unscientific, and even worse, people are misdirected to 
				believe that what science cannot understand is bad things;</li>
			<li>Is it scientific to take Western medicine to stop carsick 
				dizziness? If patients take medicine to get rid of the symptoms, 
				nerve conduction and reaction will be interfered. That means we 
				control one disease at the risk of asking for another trouble.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Diarrhea or vomiting due to ingestion of unhealthy food is 
			beneficial for our body, because our body discharges unwanted food 
			automatically for self-protection. What do you think if Western 
			doctor helps the patient stop diarrhea or vomiting? </li>
	  <li>During foot massage, the points at foot soles that correspond to 
			affected organs will be sensitive or even painful. Western medicine 
			will never understand this principle;
		<ul>
			<li>Or using acupuncture-where there is a pain, there is an 
				acupuncture needle.</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>We have got accustomed to the belief that Western science is true 
			science, while the legacy of our ancestors is superstition. People 
			dare not mention it for fear that others might think differently 
			about them;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Other 
	medicine (including Western medicine) is unable to control the MingXuan and 
	healing reactions caused by our TCM, and such reactions actually indicate 
	that the medicine is right for the disease and is exerting its potency;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>We can't use analgesic (such as Demerol and morphine) to control 
			pains caused by TCM therapy; antipyretic does not work in treating 
			fever caused by TCM therapy; the reason is that Chinese medicine 
			will stop side effects and harms caused by other medicine, and it is 
			this point that presents the human body's instinct and shows TCM's 
			greatness;</li>
		<li>We must wait for the automatic stop after the treatment; during this 
			period, the best way is to have a rest in bed, and take TCM on time;</li>
		<li>Of course, if you don't want to cure your disease, you can stop the 
			therapy and the medicines; and the reactions will stop after the medicine 
			potency gives off; </li>
	</ul>
	<li>'Though it 
	can't be explained in modern science, we care more about therapeutic effect. 
	If it cures patients, what's harm without reason? It is just like talking 
	and doing, in real society, talking and doing are always separated, that is 
	to say, a person who speaks well doesn't mean he can do things well;</li>
	<ul>
		<li>A great man once said: the cat that catches rats is a good cat, 
			regardless of white cat or black cat;</li>
		<li>He often said: practice is the only criterion for testing truth; 
			here, we may paraphrase: therapeutic effect is the only criterion 
			for telling medicine;</li>
	  <li>The remarkable therapeutic effect of TCM has been proved over the 
			long history of human beings. If you have any doubt, you are welcome 
			to have a try;
		<ul>
			<li>Till now, scientists haven't find any relation between meridians 
				and health, and Chinese medicine's effect on our body, so they 
				doubt whether it is right;</li>
			<li>Well, do you believe in TCM? If yes, it means you don't believe 
				science;</li>
			<li>Science itself is not necessarily scientific, for the concept of 
				science has been confused, or people believe in science blindly!</li>
			<li>A very simple example: Einstein founded Theory Relativity (one 
				object that moves relatively faster than another will 
				accelerate or decelerate the time) in 1905, and it was not 
				finally accepted until 100 years later (Nov. 11<sup>th</sup> 
				2007);</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>TCM does not accept what Western medicine preaches, and what TCM 
			can't tolerate is the latter's ungrounded and biased remarks and 
			criticisms;</li>
	</ul>
</ol>&#12288;</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom:0">
	Generally, people complain about TCM's slow effect, so we <u>modernize 
	Chinese medicine</u> to adapt to modern lifestyle and environment;</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm" start="1" type="1">
		<li>99% of our patients can feel the improvement progress starts within 3 
		days after taking our medicine! Even: 
		<ul>
			<li>80% of patients will feel so on the day they use our prescription.</li>
			<li>60% of patients will feel so within 1-20 minutes after our 
			treatment!</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>1% of patients may not experience the above mentioned reactions, or the 
		effect of the medicines, but it does not affect therapeutic effect. In fact, 
		the treat takes effect but the patients are unaware of it (just like 
		most of us can't pay attention to our heartbeat or breath);
		<ul>
			<li>Some people body and meridian are more sensitive, while others are 
		  not;</li>
			<li>In case of severe illness, the potency of medicines have to accumulate 
			before reactions occur (it is just like that you need to add another 
			spoon of sugar if the drink is not sweet enough);</li>
			<li>Some diseases themselves may destroy patients' perceptivity, and 
			their nerve conduction;</li>
		</ul>
	  <li>Cancers are intelligent cells (evidenced by the history of biological 
		evolution and the emerging bionics) and never await their doom. If not 
		eradicated, they will make a comeback and attack the patients more 
		fiercely;
 		<ul>
			<li>Now time and speed matter most: maybe the pharmaceuticals take 
			effect faster, otherwise the cancer will expand more quickly! As one 
			survives, another will die. Most people hear about virus variation 
			and modern Western medicine can do nothing about it. For example, 
			what western doctors are able to do is only to wait for
			"SARS" to disappear 
			naturally;</li>
			<li>Do you know about the viability of flies, mice and cockroaches? As a 
			matter of fact, pathogenic bacteria have far stronger viability. The 
			more inferior the organism is, the stronger viability it has (e.g., 
			protozoan, any of the lowest-rank and single-cell organisms)</li>
			<li>In reality, we can see that the combined wisdom of great modern 
			scientists is insufficient to get rid of pathogenic bacteria which 
			have been evolving for millions of years!
  			<ul>
				<li>The fact that the human body consists of bacteria casts doubt on 
				the function of antibiotics, a great invention of Western 
				medicine, for antibiotics fail to tell bad bacteria from good 
				bacteria;</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>If a patient has a good body with strong resistance and immunity or the 
		illness is at its early stage, the possibility of recovery is high; the 
		therapeutic effect differs from area to area. For instance, Eastern 
		people are more ready to accept TCM, or accept TCM therapy at the same 
		time, and the recovery rate is up to 99%.
 		<ul>
			<li>Before the emergence of a disease, TCM can diagnose the symptoms and 
			prevent the disease. So there is no question of recovery rate;</li>
			<li>If the patients have been ill for many years, with weak constitution 
			and resistance, or if the patients have been given up by Western 
			medicine, it is difficult to cure, but it doesn't mean there is no 
			hope; this phenomenon usually appears in Western countries, because 
			the patients turn to TCM for the last resort, the recovery rate is 
			merely 40%, or lower;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>It will be more difficult for patients who have undergone operations! 
		Because their meridians, which determine their body conditions, have 
		been broken or damaged;
 		<ul>
			<li>Some doctors cut off patients' vital meridians due to ignorance;</li>
			<li>Some patients' vital meridians are cut off because of their 
			ignorance, and those patients are pitiful;</li>
			<li>For TCM, surgical operation is seldom the best option. They just 
			prefer a better way to cure patients without inflicting too much 
			pain and damage on the patient.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Western medicine adopts local blocking method to contain pain or injury 
		(usually with the aid of anesthetics and hormones), which sometime 
		causes an irreversible and permanent damage to meridians and their nerve 
		conduction;. So the therapy is actually a self-deceiving and unwise 
		method.</li>

	Here, we do not want to talk big, like earliest discoveries, inventions or 
	contributions. Let's get down to business and try to solve your practical 
	problems. Just do it and try this TCM therapy, a few small sesames or peas 
	can force/drive out the diseases plaguing the patient for many years, and 
	also eradicate it! Seeing is believing. Why not try this quintessence of a 
	5,000-year civilization, or the magic of TCM? Why not make a try?</p>

	If your meridians are obstructed, you feel pain and even fall ill. Under the 
	influence of a TCM medicine, the affected meridians are being treated and 
	you will feel pain. <u>Agony signals the natural response of human body to a 
	disease</u>;</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm" start="1" type="1">
		<li>A short-term imbalance exists before a new balance. This is so called 
		dynamic balance. It is a normal reaction, and you will feel yourself better again after such reaction. 
	  <ul>
			<li>Pregnancy is kind of a rebirth for a woman. During pregnancy, major 
			change to internal secretion enables a pregnant woman to recondition 
			her health status. On the surface, the lying-in woman losses a lot 
			of vital energy. But in fact, apart from birth pangs, she benefits 
			most. In some difficult cases, if the patient is a married woman at 
			the child-bearing age, our advice is to give one more birth. With 
			appropriate recuperation, diseases will easily disappear after 
			delivery. Subconsciously women will understand the benefits of 
			pregnancy. Maybe it is a reward from Mother Nature.</li>
			<li>If a woman gives birth to and nurses a child at a relatively old 
			age, she will probably enjoy a long life. This is the symbol of 
			vigor for such a woman. The aging of reproductive system is directly 
			related to that of other organs. A woman whose climacteric comes 
			later will enjoy a longer longevity.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>It is similar to rally drill of "One, two, one";. At beggening, the 
		soldiers are not in the same step, when the trainer shouts "one, two, 
		one";, the group pace will be more irregular since they are all adjusting 
		their pace to achieve synchronism. After a period of muddle, they will 
		become synchronous, orderly and normal.</li>
		<li>To put it simple, human meridians is like a transportation network 
		including air, water and land transportation modes. The coordination of 
		meridians can guarantee normal working of all human organs. Once these 
		"channels"; are broken or blocked, various diseases or the dysfunction of 
		some human body will rise. If we talk more further, then it become to a 
		topic of <u>prolonging life</u>;</li>
	  <li>In the sense of Western medicine, it is a biological targeted missile 
		that can automatically identify and hit the target so that it can be 
		cured (biological targeted missile in Western medicine was recently 
		developed. It is said to be very advanced and costly but not very 
		reliable). As a matter fact, traditional Chinese doctors have been using 
		such missile for thousands of years;
 		<ul>
			<li>When Western medicine was introduced into China, its philosophy of 
			pretending to be responsible but shrugging off any difficult case 
			simply with "I am sorry"; as well as relevant policy inclined towards 
			Western medicine almost drove TCM practitioners out of mainland 
	    China;</li>
			<li>The rise of modern sciences almost eradicated traditional cultures 
			(including <i>Book of Changes</i> and TCM);</li>
			<li>If you are interested enough, you may find modern Western people 
			(such as Americans and Germans) concentrating on the study of 
			traditional Chinese classics (including <i>Book of Changes</i> and
			<i>The Art of War</i> <i>by Sunzi</i>);
  			<ul>
				<li>A wise man shall not heed only one side or echo what other says, 
				but have independent thinking and judging ability;</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Wake up and believe in traditional Chinese medicine to build up our 
			body and recover our health. Do not worry about cold, SARS or bird 
			flu, cancer or even AIDS;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Generally speaking, the patient suffers most when the meridians are 
		about to be opened;</li>
	  <li>Under the effect of our medicine, you might remember or think of the 
		diseases that plagued you more than 10 years ago. Our therapy worked to 
		expel your former injuries or diseases out of your body;
 		<ul>
			<li>This is the miracle of traditional Chinese medicine is modern 
			society. Such miracle cannot be created by Western doctors or 
			so-called TCM practitioners trained in a Western medical system;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>As a matter of fact, the patient's uncomfortable symptoms are natural 
		resistance of human body to a disease, or human body's 
		self-conditioning, such as pain;
 		<ul>
			<li>o In case of a 
			light illness, the patient has enough immunity to get rid of the 
			disease at its earliest stage. The symptoms of discomfort will 
			disappear in a couple of days. In this sense, human natural 
	    resistance conquers the disease;</li>
			<li>Otherwise, the disease will develop and worsen. By then external 
			assistance, especially doctors or physicians, will be needed;
  			<ul>
				<li>TCM treats the case by reinforcing and helping human immunity to 
				fight the disease;</li>
				<li>Western medicine usually treats the case by killing the affected 
				site with chemicals, removing it with scalpels or replacing with 
				transplanted organs. This is kind of cutting the cart before the 
				horse, or acting in a way that goes against the natural course;</li>

	<ol style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm" start="1" type="1">
		<li>In each of the abovementioned cases of unbalanced meridian, the 
		meridians are listed in the order of severity (i.e., the first one is 
		major contradiction affected most, while the rest are secondary 
		contradictions);</li>
	  <li>The meridians are listed in the order of severity of imbalance. The most 
		unbalanced one is first regulated. When this meridian is made close to 
		balance, the regulation shall be paused, for there is a worse affected 
		meridian has to be addressed:
 		<ul>
			<li>Then we regulate the formerly second unbalanced meridian, for it now 
			becomes the most unbalanced meridian and the major contradiction;</li>
			<li>Likewise, when this meridian almost reaches the balance, it shall be 
			paused because there is another worse unbalanced meridian that has 
			to be adjusted. The formerly third unbalanced meridian becomes the 
			worst affected one;</li>
			<li>The above sequences may change from time to time. Sometimes new 
			unbalanced meridians occur, or a formerly unbalanced meridian 
			automatically becomes balanced;</li>
			<li>Through repeated regulations, all the unbalanced meridians are 
			reconditioned well - this is the true meaning and principle of

		<li>If the efforts are concentrated on adjusting the formerly most

			effect;</li>
			<li>It is undoubtedly close to misdiagnosis or misjudgment;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>With the change of order of unbalanced meridians, i.e., change of most

<p style="margin-bottom: 0">Maybe you will feel intolerable during this stage, but you will surely feel

	hesitate but learn to accept this fact:</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm" start="1" type="1">
	  <li>For weak patients with severe conditions who cannot bear the efficacy of

 		<ul>
			<li>Divide the stage into several minor phases to make the reactions 
			tolerable;</li>
		</ul>
		<li><b><span style="background: yellow">
		Take things as they come</span></b>. 
		Keep calm and do not forget about mutual assistance.
		<span style="background: yellow">Do not ask for too much. </span>Do not 
		be greedy or think too much about something (do not be excessively happy 
		or unhappy);</li>
 		<ul>
			<li><span style="background: yellow">
			If you sense any of the above reactions, do not touch the affected 
			site or any place where such reaction occurs.</span> Let such reactions go away naturally;</li>
		  <li>Accept such reactions calmly and silently with an unruffled mind. Do 
			not complain, groan, or blame everyone. Only a trace amount of 
			complain or groan will adversely affect the effect of our treatment;
  			<ul>
				<li>We believe in and trust your forbearance. So calm down and be 
				patient. Everything will be OK;</li>
				<li>Young adults have stronger endurance than old or weak people. So 
				they get more dosage, experience higher intensity of reactions 
				and recover faster;</li>
			</ul>
			<li>You shall be full of gratitude to our traditional Chinese medicine 
			with a long history of around 5000 years;</li>
		  <li>Wait for those sensations to disappear and try to enjoy or 
			experience them during such waiting; (try your best)
  			<ul>
				<li>Avoid being caught in a draught (evil wind is the first cause of 
				various diseases);</li>
				<li>Wash with cold water or enjoy cold drinks and raw or cold foods 
				are forbidden during this period;</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Family members of each patient: must be confident enough to help the 
			patient get over the difficulties;
  			<ul>
				<li>Family members' good attitude and confidence matter most to the 
        patient's treatment and recovery. <b>Give up, or keep believing!</b></li>
				<li>Don't be in two minds about our product. It is the best medicine 
				and therapy in the world. It is a well proven method, so what 
        else do you want?</li>
				<li>Take good care of the patient and protect him/her from other 
				disturbances, especially during intense reactions (similar to a 
				key phase of philosophical meditation during which time no 
				interference is allowed);</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	  <li>The unbalance of seven emotions (joy, anger, worry, over thinking, 
		grief, fear and shock) affects the functions of internal organs, 
		disorders qi blood, blocks channel qi and causes or aggravates illness. 
		Excessive emotions may damage different internal organs. Do be careful:
 		<ul>
			<li>An excess of joy may lead to the sluggishness of vital energy. Joy 
			reflects the status of heart. Overwhelming or excessive joy will 
			result in slackness of heart qi, divided attention and 
			uncontrollable operation of channel qi;</li>
			<li>Anger causes qi to ascend. Anger reflects the status of liver. 
			Excessive anger impairs the liver, leads to quick ascending and 
			dredging of liver qi and blood rising with the qi;</li>
			<li>Excessive thinking leads to the stagnation of qi. Thinking reflects 
			the status of spleen. Over thinking impairs the spleen. Excessive 
			thinking, especially excessive worry, often leads to the stagnation 
	    and abnormal ascending or descending of qi in spleen & stomach;</li>
			<li>Grief causes qi depression. Grief shows the status of lung. 
			Excessive grief will impair lung qi;</li>
			<li>Fear causes qi collapse. Fear shows the status of kidney. Excessive 
			fear will impair kidney qi;
  			<ul>
				<li>Adjust your mindset. Don't be frightened. Fear will cause qi to 
				sink, reduce your immunity and adversely affect therapeutic 
				effect;</li>
				<li>TCM therapy works best in stimulating the patient's initiative. 
				No one wants to be quitter;</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Shock causes qi disturbance. Shock impairs the heart and leads to 
			distraction and turbulence of heart qi;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Positive attitude and support of friends and relatives:
 		<ul>
			<li>Symptoms of morbid changes to different meridians and internal 
			organs, the severity of disease and personal endurance vary from 
			person to person (that is why being a doctor is so demanding);</li>
			<li>Due to the similarities between symptoms of pericardium meridian and 
			kidney meridian (with severity of disease and personal endurance), 
			an ordinary doctor might easily mistake pericardium symptoms for 
			kidney meridian. Therefore, misunderstanding, misjudgment, 
    misguidance, misdiagnosis, wrong therapy... just follow; </li>
			<li>As a rule, lookers-on just see what they can see, but do not see 
			what they cannot see. They forget about what they cannot see or 
			know, including knowledge beyond their apprehension;</li>

	<p>Warning: anyone who chooses not to follow our instructions might receive 
	unexpected reactions. Their reactions are not necessarily normal, i.e., not 
	one of MingXuan reactions.</p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 0">
	
	The patient shall not give up halfway during treatment but go through the 
	whole treatment. Otherwise it is a waste of time and energy to receive 
	treatment after a period of interruption;</p>
	<ol style="margin-top: 0cm; margin-bottom: 0cm" start="1" type="1">
	  <li>Some patients give up their treatment and waste all their previous 
		efforts. It is a real pity that they are almost successful;
 		<ul>
			<li>If the pause is due to work or other reasons, you shall try best to 
			continue the treatment once you have enough time;</li>
			<li>TCM is the best medical system, and the Western medicine cannot 
			offer any help;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>When the body approaches balance, the adjustments will be slight and the 
		patient may not sense the above reactions by then;
 		<ul>
			<li>You might consider stopping the medicine and allow for automatic 
			body regulation; or continue to take our medicine for three months 
			after the reactions disappear. For specific measures and time, you 
			may consult us;</li>
			<li>Decoct and drink our medicine even when you are healthy;</li>
		</ul>
		<li>If you have the chance to receive our therapy and you sense the above 
		feelings or sensations, Congratulations!
 		<ul>
			<li>Then we will be more glad if you try to do something for TCM: tell 
			other patients the basics and benefits of TCM and help them 
			understand and accept TCM;</li>
			<li>If you try to help others and do good deeds, you will recover sooner 
			and be healthier.</li>
		</ul>
	</ol>
	<p>When you recover to a certain extent, you will be very sensitive to the 
	change of solar periods, weather and seasons as well as sun and moon 
	movement, magnetic storm and solar storm. That shows your harmony with 
	nature and kind of self-protection. Don't fret or worry. It will be OK after 
	such reactions. You are also sensitive to ordinary food and environment. If 
	you eat unhealthy or polluted foods, diarrhea will occur soon. All such 
	symptoms are human body's repulsion to and self-protection against foreign 
	pathogenic matters.</p>
	<p>It is worth noting that the reactions at the first stage stand for the 
	treatment of existing diseases, while the following reactions occur to 
	prevent any future disease, or preserve health or prolong life. Of course, 
	the improvement of health are also related to one's study, career, business, 
	official career, luck, etc. The time of appearance of them varies from 
	person to person and is closely related to each person's age, constitution 
	and physical & mental qualities (With superior performance and without 
	harmful chemicals, our products are suitable for long-term use).</p>
