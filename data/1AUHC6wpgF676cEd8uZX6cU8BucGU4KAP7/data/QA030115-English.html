  <p align="center"><font size="6">What does the 
		Chinese medicine doctor practicing western medicine treat the mechanism 
		the distinction is?</font></p>
  <p align="right"><a href="/1AUHC6wpgF676cEd8uZX6cU8BucGU4KAP7">1AUHC6wpgF676cEd8uZX6cU8BucGU4KAP7</a></p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Doctor practicing western medicine's function is similar to the poison 
		user and the instruction, instructs the people to use the toxicant to 
		treat or to kill by poison on their body to send the germ, the 
		microorganism. Is method which one kind uses poison to combat poison 
		(its in order to control the pathogenesis cell or the cancer cell 
		multiplies, needs to destroy cell DNA (deacidizing ribonucleic acid 
		(RNA)) to synthesize and so on function, simultaneously has 
		corresponding influence to normal cell, therefore in course of treatment 
		has enormous side effect); </li>
        <ul>
        <li>Or is west the pharmaceutical factory sales promotion / retails, their 
		work is accurately distributes the toxicant (west pharmaceutical factory 
		to be responsible to study must be allowed to kill by poison with 
		any / how much toxicants sends germ, but human body suffers injury may 
		control in may receptivity, guaranteed cannot kill by poison); </li>
        <ul>
        <li>The doctor practicing western medicine most 
		important department medicine, the newest medicine = best treatment, the 
		newest medicine = gives the patient for the patient the best treatment;
		</li>
        <li>Certainly, newest medicine = most expensive 
		medicine, but is not equal to the most effective medicine; </li>
        <li>You should better not count on it does not 
		have the poison, only prays as desired poisonous skill some, perhaps 
		poisonous persuasive somewhat (minus hair, few destructions hepatorenal 
		function); </li>
        </ul>
        <li>But the doctor practicing western medicine / western medicine to patient's 
		poisonous side effect, as well as the antibiotic question is is unable 
		to solve, is born that way;</li>
        <ul>
        <li>On July 7, 2002 the American disease control center announced that, 
		discovered the first example Vancomycin-Resistant Staph Aureus, VRSA the 
		case of illness, the medicine expert worried already the long nightmare 
		already became the fact;</li>
        <li>The penicillin once caused the doctor practicing western medicine study 
		revolution, but it was nearly invalid to the golden yellow 
		staphylococcus, the bacterium unceasingly changed suddenly, has all had 
		the resistivity to the many kinds of antibiotics, now already had 
		theMethicillin-Resistant Staph Aureus, MRSA, the Vancomycin-Resistant 
		Enterococcus, VRE; </li>
		<li>After appears VRSA, makes one care about this kind of bacterium can 
		disseminate in the sickness? Could repeat for 1950 ages, because 
		appeared the Vancomycin-Resistant Enterococcus, after the surgery 
		infected the universal popular situation? Can one day not to completely 
		treat patient's method;</li>
        <li>Future possibly will like before the penicillin invention, many present 
		become accustomed to save a life the surgery, will be able because will 
		be unable to eliminate the golden yellow staphylococcus the threat but 
		to implement with difficulty; </li>
        <li>Mr. has seen the cockroach or the mouse, the humanity never does not 
		want to extinguish them certainly, but is possible? Also much less is 
		compared to they small also primitive microorganism (a more primitive 
		biology, vitality is also stronger), they far appeared before in the 
		humanity has existed, they were Earth's original resident; </li>
        </ul>
        <li>If does not have the toxicant to be allowed to kill by poison, then 
		excises or replaces it. The modern age mechanic, imitates the machinery 
		service principle replacement damage the spare part, may be may, but the 
		level has lowered. Moreover from the ethics said always has the 
		difficult word place, after some transplant techniques patient, the 
		disposition custom manner thought conduct changed, turned with has 
		provided the organ same, even smoked the excessive drinking custom to be 
		also same, this only could explain provided the organ to die by no 
		means, the modern ethics scholars were worth being possible to encircle 
		may select; <ul>
        <li>Pleased hepatorenal transplant, leukemia patient's marrow transplant;
		</li>
        <li>But like does not pursue the appropriate contributor, the nature fate 
		willed it so (has found also very how many); </li>
        <li>North America has the thousands of leukemia 
		patient every year marrow period which waits for tallies, waits for 
		gains without pains perishes (on July 8, 2002 international blood 
		conference, Canadian passing society everywhere may electricity); </li>
        <li>As for chops the toe to evade the sand 
		insect, resorts to a cure worse than the sickness, satisfies thirst by 
		drinking poison, then is self-evident; </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Lacks carries on the prevention and the treatment technology to the 
		different stage disease, has not arisen starts without knowing where to 
		begin (or intoxicates), has arisen only can be just right for the 
		illness;</li>
        <li>When development western medicine, often 
		only has two, three new medicines in more than 5,000 research finally 
		can through the clinical experiment, but each research possible factor 
		million US dollars, the command to make the new medicine the cost to be 
		extremely high;</li>
        <ul>
        <li>The doctor practicing western medicine 
		through the force method, hardly many nonessential functions (or called 
		side effect) fills for the patient, moreover always did not plan or has 
		not remembered to the patient provides the second kind of choice, this 
		kind of business model already could not meet patient's need, could not 
		meet the modern need, specially the modern age had the thought and 
		already the patient which awakened; </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Moreover the curative effect is obvious to 
		all; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>The pharmaceutical factory response is 
		accelerates the development;</li>
        <li>Doctor's response is waits patiently, if 
		has the new medicine to inform you immediately; </li>
        <li>This is the present 
		international standard, legitimate, is regular legitimately, modern 
		people's medical way;</li>
        <li>Although the doctor practicing western medicine has gathered the global 
		person concerned's mental ability, unceasingly increases the new 
		technology, however increases the thing to be more, can bring more 
		loopholes; </li>
        <li>Or said if some topic has recent discovery every day, every day has the 
		remarkable progress, then only can say it not yet is mature; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>What a pity is the doctor 
		practicing western medicine has recent discovery nearly every day!</li>
		<li>But who since discovered how 
		many recent discovery the Chinese medicine millennium has had? </li>
        </ul>
        <li>If the non- standard, as well as because blind and the irresponsible 
		large dose hormone produces the bone necrosis (bone is dry);</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Frequently world standard, or 
		world health expert, also how? May cope with the birds and beasts flu, 
		may treat the cold?</li>
		<li>Whether or not will be able 
		to treat the cold to decide as the world the standard, or reputation for 
		world health expert? If in civilized world scientists also some 
		strengths of spirit, please; </li>
        </ul>

		<li>Mr. does not see water and sky of the Yellow River to come up, Mr. does 
		not see the person tear which waits for gains without pains tearfully: 
		In the non- blood relationship crowd, makes the blood stem cell the 
		matching success ratio to be very low, in ten ten thousand people only 
		then possibly finds to match. January 26, 2004 material demonstrated 
		that, merely in China, waited for makes the blood stem cell transplant 
		the leukemia patient has 4 million, probably has 50% is the child, why 
		the great scientist or are the doctors practicing western medicine 
		proud? They should see patient's bitter tear; </li>
		<li>Australian Melbourne's Peter the Maccallum cancer center, studies in 
		five years time follows up 179 lungs cancer treatment situation. The 
		statistical figure demonstrated that, studies the conclusion up to 2001 
		up to, only some 8 lung cancer patient still survived, survival 
		percentage not to 5%!</li>
		<li>As for heart disease, hypertension, renopathy, or diabetes, how many 
		people also has is may stop the medicine, but does not need life-long to 
		take medicine? This calculates? Calculated convalesces? The pitiful 
		people are also kept in the dark; </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Certainly west doctors the intention, also is is worth sympathizing 
		with, they also are the victim; </li>
		<ul>
			<li>Is not very many doctors practicing western medicine knew they are 
		already deceived or are misled (doctor practicing western medicine's 
		theory and western medicine factory);</li>
			<li>Was not very many doctors practicing western medicine knew they are 
		deceiving or mislead the others (pain certainly to look but in fact by 
		no means like this patient), very many people time have neglected in the 
		beginning of the disease by scientific or the irresponsible physical 
		examination time, very many people already were revealed at the disease 
		have misdiagnosed by the science or the computer breakdown, very many 
		people in front of being terminally ill is been scientific or ignorantly 
		gets rid; </li>
		</ul>
        <li>The doctor practicing western medicine now still 
		occupies passive and tries to find out the outlet in the process; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>Had seen a patient, relates by her knew, doctor 
		practicing western medicine's all almost cut her body on components: The 
		thyroid gland cut, the stomach has cut, the breast has cut, the womb has 
		cut, two side ovaries has cut, has be not muched left! We whether or not 
		thought deep, really is has the necessity to cut? Also has compared to 
		cuts a better method? Excision later patient's situation how? This is 
		the medicine should choice perhaps only choice? This is (with puts to 
		death by dismemberment to the life respect garrulously hacks what 
		differently)?</li>
        <li>If may the early diagnosis, not need to cut this to 
		cut that, may cure the patient, also why not? West doctors meet the 
		compunction?</li>
        <li>Has an elder to say that, I never saw that kind of business to be 
		defeated richly have also received, or fortunately the meaning received 
		money, except doctor practicing western medicine;</li>
		<li>Their scientific nature and the reliability, 
		believed does not compare the financial expert to the market analysis in 
		the line; </li>
        </ul>
 
        
        </ul>
 
        <li>The Chinese medicine treatment is is solid this cultivates the Yuan and 
		straightens up exorcises, cultivates is holding weak, compounds the 
		vitality, invigorates the blood remove extravasted blood, to improve and 
		to enhance the bodily function, thus fighting disease. Because the 
		disease cause of disease pathogenesis nothing more than internal organs 
		owe empty, the stagnation of flow of vital energy blood stasis, the 
		phlegm tie wet gather, painfully hot sun the embodiment, the channels 
		and collaterals stasis anti- and so on:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>The human body health is decided by the nerve, endocrine, the 
		circulation and the immunity function harmony has the foreword, human 
		body any pathological change, regardless of is the pathogen invasion is 
		the result of, or the climatic factor, the psychological factor or the 
		habits and customs / way causes, all is the result which the nerve, the 
		internal secretion, the circulation and the immunity function is out of 
		balance, namely is unbalanced; </li>
        <li>The Chinese medicine is not or sends the sick body to the cancer to 
		catch up with kills certainly, but is the raise and the prop human body 
		own resistivity and the immunity, the drive organism independent 
		ability; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>The general good six achievements have been allowed to stop the 
		medicine, lets organism cope with; </li>
        <li>Resembles the automobile to the red candle in front of wants throttle, 
		the inertia can cause the vehicles to continue to go, otherwise must 
		worry about the vehicle (overcorrects does not conform to Golden Mean);
		</li>
        <li>Or the picture climbs a mountain, has proceeded to the summit is again 
		descended a mountain, when things reach their extreme they turn back, 
		quits when you're ahead;</li>
        </ul>
 
        <li>Therefore the Chinese medicine is does not have the poisonous side 
		effect as well as the antibiotic question (stops medicine after, still had 
		correctly to recuperate with keeping in good health, caused health 
		resident); </li>
        <ul>
        <li>If some people because of certain reasons, thought may dismantle the 
		bridge after crossing, certainly could from seek its shame perhaps reap 
		what has been sown; </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The Chinese medicine principle is:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>The adjustment principle, with the Chinese native medicine, the 
		masculine and feminine elements five lines, the universe can the field 
		adjust the unbalanced channels and collaterals and the organism; </li>
        <li>The harmonious principle, is same like the radio, causes the patient and 
		the universe or the nature harmony, the fusion, the beauty gathers one, 
		the nature strength can cause it to convalesce;</li>
        <li>The balance principle, is same like the balance, nearby patient's two 
		achieved the balance is a health; </li>
        <li>Four two dials the extremely heavy principle, is one skill, is not the 
		big stone is battered to death the crab, is not chops the toe to evade 
		the granulated substance insect, is not ignorant kills by poison the 
		electric shock; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>
		Compared to Archimedes: For me a pivot, I 
		can lift the Earth cannot miss to there go, moreover as if makes sense 
		and early proposed, what napier is not the imported product; </li>
		<li>
		Taijiquan principle also similarly so;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Puts briefly, is takes advantage of opportunity lead skill the 
		principle;</li>
        <li>Below is our Chang Hui hears, is not certainly correct (may add on 
		certainly to), so forth only sees the trees not to see the forest, 
		actually has been separated from with the Chinese medicine principle:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Treats the cancer the Chinese native medicine to treat the cold the 
		Chinese native medicine to be more expensive than, daily dosage also big 
		many; </li>
        <li>The Chinese medicine is with the agkistrodon acutus tongue grass, 
		euphorbia fisheriana, the white arsenic, a seven flower, half lotus, the 
		camptotheca acuminata, the vinca rosea, dried toad venom, is drunk the 
		soul cane, the olive is kind and the purple Dan cane and so on treats 
		the cancer; </li>
        <li>The Chinese native medicine can increase the chemotherapy medicine the 
		sensitivity, may reduce or the reduced cancer cell regarding the 
		chemotherapy drug resistance, the increase chemotherapy effect;</li>
        <li>To some Chinese native 
		medicine investment large amount of money research, hoped discovers its 
		anti- cancer principle; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>Carries on in vitro chemical 
		activity test the Chinese medicine, discovered has kills by poison the 
		tumor cell and the anti- oxidized effect; </li>
        <li>Carries on the pharmacology 
		experiment and the toxicology experiment the Chinese medicine, as well 
		as chemical composition and active analysis;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>In order to understand the 
		Chinese medicine, establishes the Chinese native medicine tube basis, 
		conducts the research in view of the on hundred kind of Chinese 
		medicine;</li>
        <li>Insufficiency of the 
		supplement or the revision book on Chinese medicine, or revises it of 
		with the modern medicine knowledge;</li>
        <li>Some research institute or the Chinese medicine expert studies Chinese 
		medicine formula / Chinese medicine prepared medicine, monopolizes any any 
		cancer;</li>
        </ul>
        <li>When some people said to you: He is the Chinese medicine acupuncture and 
		moxibustion expert, perhaps the Chinese medicine cancer expert, or 
		grasps some folk prescription, understood treats some disease... ... If 
		you also have the sympathy but also gives up, you should use sympathetic 
		the look to look him, because he is indeed very pitiful, he only was 
		extremely rare studies the Chinese medicine some to think has learned 
		the Chinese medicine. The Chinese medicine has the system, is a 
		comprehensive discipline, we should not quote out of context; </li>
        <li>In hope medical Chinese medicine method diagnosis, treats an illness 
		with the Chinese medicine method, with Chinese medicine method 
		observation, with Chinese medicine method research, with Chinese 
		medicine method professor; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>The Chinese medicine is a complete medicine, does not have to rely on 
		academically with the aid of other supplemented or consummates it, 
		because since is an integrity, also what comes insufficient? How many 
		millenniums does the Chinese medicine have the history, the doctor 
		practicing western medicine only then has how many hundred years, is 
		that these hundred year before Chinese medicine diagnoses and the 
		treatment with what? Thought deep everybody was clear; </li>
        <li>The Chinese medicine has been successfully assimilated by the doctor 
		practicing western medicine, the ocean has melted, has enslaved, this is 
		not we wants to see, is sorrowful, is should not. Now we want to do are 
		change present the situation, the change present fait accomplice, this 
		is the work which we now is imminent must do;</li>
        <li>Now Chinese medicine colleges and universities new graduation center 
		doctor, 99.99% is the treatment (cold uses aspirin with the doctor 
		practicing western medicine, has a fever with antibiotic), the diagnosis 
		uses three big conventions, X beam, the electrocardiogram, the 
		stethoscope, the sphygmomanometer;</li>
        <li>Some Chinese medicine director professor or professor director, doctor 
		(generally speaking, has bachelor, doctor, professor's title, namely 
		indicated is Chinese medicine which raises in doctor practicing western 
		medicine), even also speaks plausibly and at length: Only the useful 
		doctor practicing western medicine's diagnosis, only then knew patient's 
		condition, only then knows the Chinese medicine the treatment result! If 
		has that center doctor not so, was certainly does not have only has; </li>
       <li>Now the traditional Chinese medicine college teaches the content, 
		basically is for, facilitates the test which take a test passes an 
		examination establishes, or in order to take a test; </li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>The Chinese native medicine 
		is only a Chinese medicine component, mutually depends on for existence, 
		the Chinese medicine and the Chinese native medicine are cannot 
		separate, the Chinese native medicine must coordinate the Chinese 
		medicine to be able to have the progress;</li>
        <ul>
			<li>The modern scientist 
		(including Chinese medicine and doctor practicing western medicine, 
		scientific research unit and institutions of higher learning, home and 
		overseas) complies the western medicine pattern, develops the Chinese 
		native medicine with the western development western medicine way, 
		attempts appraises certain effective components from the raw material 
		for medicine, and tries to depute, the result all is the defeat, the 
		result is not big;</li>
        <ul>
				<li>Because the Chinese native medicine ingredient is extremely complex, the 
		medicine may contain on hundred ingredients constantly, these 
		ingredients when the normal temperature and the high temperature, in 
		vivo and in vitro, alone exists and with other together existence can 
		have the different existence form and the mechanism, has the different 
		physical change and the chemical change; </li>
				<li>Simultaneously compound prescription often can have dozens of medicines, 
		has the rulers and the ministers to assist causes; </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Chinese medicine Tang Fangzhong many had 
		the certain clinical result, so long as again adds the research then 
		very big opportunity to have the achievement, radically needs with the 
		biotechnology to start by zero, does not have first to use the white 
		mouse experiment, later only then will perform the clinical test;</li>
        <ul>
				<li>The doctor practicing western 
		medicine the person and the mouse, in vivo and in vitro, within the 
		universe and outside the space regards as same level, is waits for the 
		discussion; </li>
			</ul>
			<li>Using had the basic theory or 
		the clinical result develops may the application Chinese native 
		medicine, may have the result in the short-term, Japan then steadily 
		occupies the global Chinese native medicine by this method seven tenths 
		markets;</li>
		</ul>
        <li>
The Chinese medicine is uses the universe energy;</li>
<ul>
        <li>The Chinese medicine 
		prescription is the universe can one of application methods, is the 
		universe can concrete use; </li>
        </ul>
        
        </ul>
        <li>Center doctor not only wants to treat the 
		patient, but also must treat / processes the doctor practicing western 
		medicine toxicant the side effect, and its harm which causes to the 
		patient, or blocks it; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>What is the doctor practicing western 
		medicine is not all clear to the cancer, how therefore discussed on 
		diagnoses the treatment, or research? Is similar to the non- standard or 
		the birds and beasts flu! </li>
		<li>The antibiotic glory history is doctor 
		practicing western medicine's magnificent history, when the antibiotic 
		declines time also is a time which the doctor practicing western 
		medicine declines, this is does not allow to question, now bears / the 
		anti- antibiotic bacterium everywhere, the antibiotic future is a total 
		darkness; </li>
		<li>The anti- virus's antitoxin has not slowly 
		been able to enter the stage, or radically is unable to enter the stage, 
		because the viral index of resistance virus's antitoxin / doctor 
		practicing western medicine is wiser; </li>
        </ul>
		<li>Same year, Toronto contracted the leukemia 
		the person of Chinese descent boy (family bit red blood cell hemopathy), 
		after the world looked everywhere the marrow not to attain low-spirited 
		returns to Canada in, certainly looked has accepted our Chinese medicine 
		treatment (1991-04-04), several Chinese native medicines soup side short 
		five months cured this to defer to the foul disease which the doctor 
		practicing western medicine knowledge had the marrow to transplant can 
		treat (to create world first example Shan K'aoyao to cure leukemia 
		patient which but could survive to startle world startled vulgar 
		medicine miracle); Similarly in Toronto, another with it similar person 
		of Chinese descent girl, the marrow transplanted successfully wants to 
		leave the world. </li>
        <li>The cancer does not govern died at the age 
		of 69 years old, famous coach nilsen dies of illness (success to perform

        <li>Abuses the antibiotic or causes the coronal virus 
	variation &quot;Central News Agency&quot; the Taibei 2003-6-15 electricity<ul>
        <li>&quot;National capital Times&quot; today quotes Harbin 
	medical college principal, pharmacology faculty working office director 
	said, although does not have the accurate epidemiology evidence to confirm, 
	this time infects humanity's coronal virus is because the humanity abuses 
	the antibiotic to create the viral gene variation the result, but the 
	present humanity abuses the harm which the antibiotic the phenomenon and 
	creates, indirectly has prompted this kind of possible existence. </li>
        <li>The serious acute respiratory tract syndrome SARS 
	epidemic situation wreaks havoc in world each place, sounded the humanity to 
	abuse the antibiotic once more the alarm bell.</li>
        <li>This pharmacology expert said that, now the 
	epidemiology expert positively is investigating the coronal virus variety 
	the reason, but in current, the foresight and highly takes to abuse the 
	antibiotic the harm, regarding resists SARS to have the vital significance.</li>
        <li>He believed, in prevents and controls in the SARS 
	process, should under the guarantee safe effective premise, the development 
	development and reasonably applies the anti- SARS medicine, avoids because 
	the human factor creates the new drug resistance production, creates the new 
	infectious disease to be popular. </li>
        <li>He quotes the World 
	Health Organization an investigation to say that, China is hospitalized the 
	patient antibiotic medicine utilization ratio to reach as high as 80%, use 
	antibiotic and jointly uses two kind of above antibiotics to account for 
	58%, far is higher than 30% international standard.</li>
        <li>The world health organization once warned that, 
	the various countries abuses the antibiotic to cause the vigorous 
	pathological change which may treat to cure with difficulty. Take the 
	pneumonia chain coccus as the example, to penicillin bears the medicine the 
	pneumonia chain coccus proportion, 21% increased from 1995 to 1998 25%, once 
	will be easiest the pneumonia streptococcic pneumonia which treated to 
	change with difficulty treats.</li>

        <li>The England gene therapy treats an illness 
		the child, makes two children to contract the leukemia (report 
		2003-6-29): </li>
        <ul>
        <li>An English medical service group uses the 
		brand-new gene therapy, creates disaster the sickness child which has 
		the congenital immunity system flaw to carry on &quot;the gene transformation 
		marrow to transplant&quot;, the new therapy transplants the traditional 
		marrow safer and is more effective than, but accepts the transplant to 
		have the possibility to suffer from the leukemia.</li>
        <li>&quot;The froth syndrome&quot; called &quot;the serious 
		compound immunity flaw&quot; (SCID), the origin is the patient congenital 
		lacks gene gammac, causes the human body to be unable to make the 
		element &quot;the gland Gansu acid deamination acid&quot; (ADA), appears the 
		immunity the question, the patient must live under the aseptic 
		environment. Because the patient is very difficult to find the 
		appropriate marrow to carry on the transplant, takes the medicine 
		substitution deficient ADA result also unsatisfactory, the new therapy 
		appears on the market concerning them really is a big good news.</li>
        <li>This London medical service group first 
		extracts the marrow from the patient body, then mixes in it a many blood

        <li>At present New York has the nearly 8,000
