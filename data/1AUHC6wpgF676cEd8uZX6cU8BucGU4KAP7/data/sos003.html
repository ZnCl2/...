<p>切爾諾貝利（&#1063;&#1086;&#1088;&#1085;&#1086;&#1073;&#1080;&#1083;&#1100;，Chernobyl）1986-04-26 
	01:24 發生的核事故，輻射量相當於 500顆美國投在日本的原子彈，8噸多強輻射物質洩露，輻射塵隨著大氣飄散到前蘇聯的西部地區、東歐地區、北歐的斯堪地維亞半島。烏克蘭、白俄羅斯、俄羅斯受污染最為嚴重，據估計約有 60%的放射性物質落在白俄羅斯的土地。蘇聯解體後獨立的國家包括俄羅斯、白俄羅斯及烏克蘭等每年仍投入經費與人力在於災變的善後以及居民健康保健。因事故而直接或間接死亡的人數難以估算，且事故後的長期影響到目前為止仍是未知數……</p>
<p>巴黎法新2011-04-24電：科學雜誌《自然》的最新分析顯示，若以日本福島第一核電站方圓75公里的禁區來做計算，目前全球有多達5億人是活在核威脅下。其中以美國受威脅人口最多，有超過1億1000萬人。中國有多達7300萬人受威脅，印度有5700萬人，德國與日本則分別有3900萬人和3300萬人住在核風險區內。不過《自然》的報道強調，要對核電站周邊範圍的潛在風險進行客觀評論&quot;幾乎不可能&quot;，而核電站周圍的人口集中程度也不能作為危險的測量。這是因為每個核設施都具有獨特的風險因素，包括地震風險、維修的質量、監督疏忽和設施內輻射性物質的數量等。然而這份分析卻讓人們意識到，若再發生另一起福島第一核電站核事故或是類似世界歷來最嚴重的核事故切爾諾貝利核事故，面對核風險的人到底有多少。</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: -19px">小常識：</p>
<ul><li>甚麼是核輻射？</li>
    <ul>
      <li>簡單來說，放射性物質以波或微粒形式發射出的一種能量就叫核輻射。核爆炸和核事故都有核輻射；</li>
      <li>宇宙、自然界能產生放射性的物質不少，但危害都不太大，只有核爆炸或核電站事故泄漏的放射性物質才能大範圍地對人員造成傷亡；</li>
    </ul>
  <li>核輻射有甚麼危害？</li>
    <ul>
      <li>核泄漏一般的情況對人員的影響表現在核輻射，也叫做放射性物質，放射性物質可通過呼吸吸入，皮膚傷口及消化道吸收進入體內，引起內輻射，y輻射可穿透一定距離被機體吸收，使人員受到外照射傷害（核輻射有a,b和y三種輻射形式。a輻射只要用一張紙就能擋住，但吸入體內危害大；b輻射是高速電子，皮膚沾上後燒傷明顯；y輻射和X射線相似，能穿透人體和建築物被機體吸收，使人員受到外照射傷害）；</li>
    </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>高溫分裂鈾的過程會產生一百多種新的化學物質，最危險的釋放物質通過吸入、攝入或皮膚吸收進入人體：</li>
      <ul>
        <li>顆粒狀放射性化學物質，包括放射性碘、碘-131、鍶-90、銫134和銫-137。對人類極其危險，因為它們酷似人體天然所需的物質（如碘），並極易進入人體的組織，多年後仍可導致各種不同癌症；</li>
        <li>碘-131：半衰期是八天，意味著它需要數月時間才會完全消失）。可通過攝入或吸入進入人體。可能落在草上被牛食入，並最終通過牛奶進入人體，也可能落在帶葉蔬菜上或聚集到海魚和淡水魚體內，被人食用（ 切爾諾貝利事故中導致超過5000個兒童甲狀腺癌病例）；</li>
        <li>鍶-90：半衰期長達29.1年。在化學性質上與鈣相似，趨於進入人的骨骼和牙齒。主要通過食物和水進入人體，可導致骨癌（骨骼附近軟組織的癌症）和白血病；</li>
        <li>銫-134：半衰期為兩年，大概要20年才會變成無害；</li>
        <li>銫-137：半衰期為30年（即30年後輻射強度才會減低一半。照此速率，至少要240年才能耗盡其放射能），即會破壞環境幾百年，尤其令人擔心。人會通過食物和水將其攝入，或類似灰塵被人吸入。會引起痙攣與非自願性肌肉收縮、無法走路、可損害人體DNA，引發癌症、先天缺損和遺傳性疾病；</li>
        <li>鈈：對人體危害比放射性碘及銫更大。半衰期極長，其中，鈈-239半衰期為2.41萬年，人類一旦吸入，鈈就會在肺及骨髓積聚，長期在體內釋放輻射，破壞細胞基因，增加患癌機會；鈈-238的半衰期為88年，並放出α粒子；鈈-240自發裂變的比率很高，容易造成中子通量激增；鈈-244，半衰期約為八千萬年，足夠使鈈以微量存在於自然環境中；</li>
        <li>鈾和其他重金屬，將掉落到反應堆安全殻的底部，不會進入大氣（之後需工作人員清理）；</li>
      <li>較低毒性的放射性氣體，包括氮-16、氚和氪。這些氣體比重輕，會快速消散，對人類的危害不大（氮-16迅速轉變為穩定的氧。氚能量很低，半衰期為12年。當它衰變時，以穩定的氦氣形式存在。氪很輕，進入大氣後迅速消散）；</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>放射病症狀有那些？</li>
  <ul>
    <li>內外照射形成放射病的症狀有：疲勞、頭昏、失眠、皮膚發紅、潰瘍、出血、脫發、白血病、嘔吐、腹瀉等。有時還會增加癌症、畸變、遺傳性病變發生率，影響幾代人的健康。一般而言，身體接受的輻射能量越多，其放射病症狀越嚴重，致癌、致畸風險越大；</li>
  </ul>
<li>半衰期：指放射性物質的原子有半數發生衰變時所需要的時間</li>
<li>碘片 (KI) ：目的是使甲狀腺內的碘飽和從而阻止放射性碘的攝入，<font color="red">不能保護來自于體外的放射性和被身體吸收的除碘以外的放射性物質</font></li>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="red">效能甚低，曝露後 3小時服用，碘-131攝取防止50%，曝露後 6小時服用無效；對40歲以上者無效，對其他物質如鍶-90、銫-137等無效</font>。功效取決於投與的時機，即將曝露之前攝取時效果最佳，隨著時間過去而效果遞減。 為了充分發揮穩定碘對碘甲狀腺阻斷效果的作用，需要在受照前或者受照後盡快服用穩定碘片。然而，在長期持續性釋放狀況下，則有可能出現重復照射的情況；</li>
    <li>且可引致副作用如甲狀腺腫大（對出生後一個月內的新生兒，穩定性碘服用量應保持在有效的最低水平。對有些人，例如，甲狀腺有結節者，突眼性甲狀腺腫已經治愈者，曾接受過放射性碘治療者，甲狀腺慢性炎症性疾病患者，甲狀腺單側切除者，有亞臨床性甲狀腺功能低下者，對碘過敏者，某些皮膚病（痤瘡、濕疹、牛皮癬）患者等，應慎用或不用穩定性碘）。僅供進入事故範圍，及短時間內曾接觸放射性物質者服用；</li>
    <li> 生理學上，人體碘的主要來源是甲狀腺的吸收，甲狀腺靠碘來産生甲狀腺激素。接觸放射性碘可導致甲狀腺癌顯著增加，特別是幼兒。吸入和食入的放射性碘在甲狀腺中蓄積；</li>
  </ul>
<li>食鹽、海帶、紫菜、碘片、鹹菜、榨菜、醬油、蝦皮等有阻止放射性碘的攝入功能？</li>
  <ul>
    <li>不行！要在短時間內攝取足夠的碘（趕在放射性碘的吸入之前）令甲狀腺內的碘飽和，以上物質的含碘量太少（食用鹽碘含量 20mg/kg - 30mg/kg），何況食鹽中氯化鈉（NaCl）含量為99％！1小時內食用 3kg食鹽已近乎荒唐。同時，碘-131僅是放射性化學物質之一，還有其他化學物質如鍶-90、銫-137等；</li>
    </ul>
<li>核輻射的治療方式？</li>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="red">中醫是唯一的治療方式</font>。人們無法控制輻射，不過可以中醫防治、提高人體抗禦能力，防止系統組織和遺傳基因受損，預防癌症，免步切爾諾貝利後塵；</li>
    <li>雖然世界這些年發展很快，但是在很多領域裡仍然非常落後和幼稚（包括曾幾何時一片高唱而現已落魄的PC和IT，也包括焦頭爛額的核能發電），在中國幾千年前已司空見慣家諭戶曉的東西，在現代人看來，仍然很新奇，特別是中醫的奧祕。</li>

  <p>In the Chernobyl (Чорнобиль, Chernobyl) nuclear accident happened in 1986-04-26 01:24, the radiation dose was equivalent to 500 atomic bombs that the United States threw onto Japan, which means that more 8 tons of strong radiation material leakage and radiation dust drifted to the western part of the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia in Northern Europe with the atmosphere. Ukraine, Belarus and Russia were the most polluted, and it is estimated that about 60% of the radioactive material fell on the land of Belarus. Countries declared independence after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, including Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are still making fund and manpower input each year for rehabilitation and resident’s health care after disaster. The number of people who were directly or indirectly killed by the accident is difficult to estimate and the long-term effects of the accident are still unknown.</p>

<p>Paris (AFP) 2011-04-24 news: The latest analysis of scientific journal Nature shows that if calculated the restricted area of the first nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan with the radius of 75 km, the currently there are up to 500 million people living under the nuclear threat all around the world. Of which the United States has the most threatened population with the number of more than 110 million people. As many as 73 million people were affected by threats in China, 57 million people in India, and there are 39 million people and 33 million people in Germany and Japan living in the risk zone respectively. However, the report of "Nature" emphasizes that it is "almost impossible" to objectively comment on the potential risks surrounding the nuclear power plant, and the risk can not be measured by the concentration of population around the nuclear power plant. This is because each nuclear facility has a unique risk factor, including earthquake risk, quality of maintenance, oversight and the amount of radioactive material within the facility.  However, this analysis makes people realize that if there is another Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant nuclear accident or nuclear accident similar to the world's most serious nuclear accident Chernobyl nuclear accident, how many people will face the nuclear risk in the end.</p>

   <p style="margin-bottom: -19px">Tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>	What is nuclear radiation?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>In simple terms, an energy emitted by radioactive material in the form of waves or particles is called nuclear radiation. Nuclear explosion and nuclear accident have radiation.</li>
      <li>The universe and the natural world can produce a lot of radioactive material with limited harm, and only radioactive material by nuclear explosions or nuclear power plant accident leakage can cause a wide range of personnel casualties.</li>
    </ul>
  <li>What is the risk of nuclear radiation?</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The most common impact of nuclear leakage on people is nuclear radiation, also known as radioactive substances, which can enter into the body through breathing inhalation, skin wounds and digestive tract absorption, causing internal radiation, while y radiation can be absorbed by body after penetrating a certain distance and lead external exposure to people. (Nuclear radiation have three kinds of radiation types a, b and y. a type radiation can be blocked by using a piece of energy paper, but will cause great harm if inhaled by the body; b type radiation is high-speed electron, which can cause obvious burn on skin; Y type radiation is similar to X ray radiation, which can be absorbed by the body after penetrated human body and buildings, therefore cause personnel damage from external exposure).</li>
    </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>	The high temperature uranium splitting process can produce more than one hundred kinds of new chemical substances, and the most dangerous substances material will enter human body through inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>	Granular radioactive chemicals, including radioactive iodine, strontium, iodine – 131, strontium - 90, cesium - 134 and cesium - 137. They are extremely dangerous to humans, because they are similar to the natural needs of the human body (such as iodine) and can easily enter into the body's organization, as well as still able to cause a variety of different cancer years later.</li>
        <li>	Iodine - 131: With the half-life of eight days, which means that it takes months to completely disappear)? Can enter the body through ingestion or inhalation. May fall into the grass and be fed by cow, and eventually enter into human body through the milk, or may also fall on the leafy vegetables or gathered into the fish and freshwater fish, which may be eaten by human (Chernobyl Accident caused more than 5000 children Thyroid cancer cases).</li>
        <li>	Strontium - 90: With the half-life of up to 29.1 years. With chemical properties similar to calcium, it tends to enter the human bones and teeth. Mainly enter into the human body through food and water and can lead to bone cancer (cancer on soft tissue near the bone) and leukemia.</li>
        <li>	Cesium - 134: With the half-life of two years, it will cost about 20 years to become harmless.</li>
        <li>	Cesium - 137: With the half-life of 30 years (i.e., the radiation intensity can only be reduced by half after 30 years. At this rate, it will need at least 240 years to run out of its radioactivity), which means it will destroy the environment for hundreds of years and is especially worrying. It will be taken by human through food and water, or be inhaled by human as dust. It will cause spasms and involuntary muscle contraction, unable to walk and can damage the human body DNA, causing cancer, congenital defects and genetic diseases.</li>
        <li>	Plutonium: Has greater harm to humans than radioactive iodine and cesium. It has very long half-life, including plutonium - 239 which has the half-life of 24,100 years. Once inhaled by human, plutonium will accumulate in the lungs and bone marrow, and then destroy cell genes and increase cancer opportunities by  long-term radiation release in the body; With the half-life of 88 Year, plutonium - 238 can release alpha particles; Plutonium - 240 has high spontaneous fission and therefore easy to lead to a surge in neutron flux.  Plutonium - 244 has a half-life of about 80 million years，which is enough to make plutonium exists natural environment with trace.</li>
        <li>	Uranium and other heavy metals will fall to the bottom of the reactor containment and will not enter the atmosphere ( need to be cleaned up by staff later).</li>
      <li>Low toxic radioactive gas, including nitrogen - 16, tritium and krypton. With light specific gravity, these gases will dissipate quickly and have little harm to humans (nitrogen - 16 will rapidly translate into stable oxygen. Tritium has low energy and a half-life of 12 years. And when it decays, it exists in the form of stable helium form. Krypton is very light and will dissipate quickly after entered into the atmosphere).</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>What are the symptoms of radiation sickness?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>	Radiation sickness symptoms caused by internal and external exposure are: Fatigue, dizziness, and insomnia, skin redness, ulcers, bleeding, hair loss, leukemia, vomiting, and diarrhea and so on. Sometimes also increase the incidence of cancer, aberrations, and hereditary lesions and affect the health of generations. In general, the body receives more radiation energy, the more serious the symptoms of radiation sickness and greater the carcinogenic, teratogenic risk will be.</li>
  </ul>
<li>	Half-life: Refers to the required time for half of the radioactive material atoms to decay.</li>
<li>	Iodine Tablet (KI): The aim is to saturate the iodine in the thyroid to prevent the intake of radioactive iodine, but <font color="red">can not protect from the radioactive material from the outside of the body and the radioactive materials absorbed by the body other than iodine</font>.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="red">With very low efficiency, it can take prevent 50% of iodine - 131 intake if used 3 hours after exposure, and will be is invalid if used 6 hours after exposure; Has no effect on people over 40 years old and also useless for other substances such as strontium - 90 and cesium - 137</font>. Its efficacy depends on the timing of the usage, which means it has the best effect is used before exposure and the effect will decrease as time goes by. In order to give full play to the role of stable iodine on iodine thyroid blockade, people need to take stable iodine tablets before or  after exposure as soon as possible.  However, in the case of long-term sustained release, there may be repeated exposure.</li>
    <li>	And it can cause side effects such as goiter (for neonates within one month after birth, the dosage of stable iodine should be kept at an minimum effective level. For some people, for example, people with thyroid nodules, with cured exophthalmos goiter, once received radioactive iodine therapy, patients with chronic cured inflammatory disease, unilateral thyroidectomy, with subclinical hypothyroidism, people allergy to iodine, patients with certain skin diseases (acne, eczema, psoriasis), etc., should not use or use stable iodine with caution). Only for people entered into the scope of the accident and have been exposed to radioactive substances for a short period of time.</li>
    <li>	In physiology, the main source of iodine in human body comes from absorption of thyroid, and the thyroid produce thyroid hormone. by iodine. Exposure to radioactive iodine can lead to a significant increase in thyroid cancer, especially in infants. Inhaled and ingested radioactive iodine will accumulate in the thyroid.</li>
  </ul>
<li>	Can salt, kelp, laver, iodine, pickles, preserved vegetable, soy sauce, and dried small shrimps prevent radioactive iodine in taking?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>	No way! Enough iodine end to be absorbed in a short period of time (before the inhalation of radioactive iodine) to the saturate the iodine inside thyroid, but the iodine content of the above materials are too little (the iodine content of edible salt is 20 mg/kg - 30 mg/kg), while its sodium chloride (NaCl) content is 99%. It is ridiculous to eat 3 kg salt within 1 hour. At the same time, iodine - 131 is only one of the radioactive chemicals, there are other chemical substances such as strontium - 90, cesium - 137 and so on.</li>
    </ul>
<li>	What is the treatment of nuclear radiation?</li>
  <ul>
    <li><font color="red">Traditional Chinese medicine is the only way of treatment</font>. 	People can't control the radiation, but traditional Chinese medicine can offer prevention and control, improve human resistance, prevent system organization and genetic damage, well as prevent cancers and avoid making the same mistake occurred in Chernobyl Accident.</li>
    <li>	Although the world has grown rapidly over the years, it is still very backward and childlike in many areas (including the PC and IT which have been widely promoted, but coming down currently, as well as the nuclear power generation which has leaded many disasters), things which are commonly used and well accepted in China for thousands of years, are still new to modern people, especially the mystery of Chinese medicine.</li>
