<p align="center"><font size="6">The ancient TCM lacks the scientific data? <br>
  Lacks the international approval the standard? </font><br>
The history can confirm the Chinese medicine 
existence and the value, like several millenniums to come to be same after, 
specially vanishes in the doctor practicing western medicine</p>

<p align="right"><a href="/1AUHC6wpgF676cEd8uZX6cU8BucGU4KAP7">1AUHC6wpgF676cEd8uZX6cU8BucGU4KAP7</a></p>

<p>Has not known the bustling place, how says the bustling place? A good 
bystander has the profession which the courage and wisdom comments him 
completely not to know, or the discipline, this itself waits for the discussion.</p>
<p>This is they does not know the Chinese medicine, possibly also adds on little 
the few prejudices... ... This is accumulates must becomes is a typical example.</p>
<p>Actually, the Chinese medicine already in accounted for in the world 1/4 
population to use long has reached several millenniums, its system integrity, 
system Yan Shen as well as the good curative effect, all were the Western 
medical skill can not hold a candle. The Chinese medicine already uses several 
millenniums things, the Western medical skill only then has now gone to the idea 
study, the research, the discovery, sought the tentative data, the certificate 
and the evidence! The very many things modern science all with difficulty 
explains (for example the pyramid question), but also only can explain the 
modern science is unable to explain, certainly cannot explain any. Or whether 
may understand like this: Others before several millenniums already the matter 
which completes, some people also are bewildered in there, touch own ears and 
cheeks... ...</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: -19">
Chinese medicine many contents, today modern scientific approach conclusion 
agree without prior consultationhappen to hold the same view after several 
millenniums, the Western medical skill theory more is to the deepened 
development, nearly more approaches the Chinese medicine certain theories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the molecular level biological research discovered many has the masculine and 
feminine elements attribute member to, but summarized the material nature in 
&quot;Yellow Emperor after&quot; in with the masculine and feminine elements; </li>
  <li>The lung has the multiple endocrine function, is quite capable to explain a 
Chinese medicine ` lung host body was mad ' said; </li>
  <li>Reflects the masculine and feminine elements balance from the pituitary gland - 
- adrenal gland axis often the valve question;</li>
  <li>Five lines of theories, the basic aspect and the cybernetics feedback mechanism 
has similar many;</li>
  <li>The Chinese native medicine compound prescription blend is very possible and the 
in vivo comprehensive regulation of metabolism process - - namely overall 
immunity is related;</li>
  <li>Biological clock rhythm and the Chinese medicine midnight and noon flows into 
the theory to have very big uniformity and so on; </li>
</ul>
<p>
Human's life is extremely short, if any matter all needed to understand the only 
then acknowledgement or used it, was not very easy, perhaps very weak matter. Or 
said we lovable scientists are being born, if in order to obtain the lungs 
expansion to absorb the first tone the scientific data, later only then will 
breathe, believed they all will be speechless, do not have the word to consider, 
because will have to die without doubt. </p>
	<p>
Or likes between captain and the sailor, captain's order sailor not necessarily 
understood, but acts accordingly / the execution then, the ship could go forward. 
If a sailor asked very many questions, why do approach left, why full sail, 
why... ... Specially the typhoon / hurricane / tornado approaches, captain can be 
called under him the cabin rest, not the time and he explained. </p>
<p>
In fact, many national like Japan, South Korea, Germany's pharmaceutical 
manufacturing plant, is simply medical prescription handed down from ancient 
times brings the Chinese medicine the production to sell, not only profit high, 
the curative effect also high (present Chinese native medicine market basically 
seizes by Japan and South Korea, in 2000 global Chinese native medicine market 
resultant 185 hundred million US dollars, Japan and South Korea from Chinese 
input Chinese native medicine raw material, retreatment exportation, have 
monopolized 90% international market).</p>
<p>
Then, why the classical Chinese medicine theory can have the that high standard? 
Down to after two millenniums medicine development not only not to its, moreover 
is also aware all must close up to it? Is ancient's world outlook and the 
methodology is wise? How many millenniums modern scientific conclusion since the 
ancient culture did have many agrees without prior consultationhappen to hold 
the same view after, what that also did explain? As ancient nation teaching 
other people, did not have the reason to pick the sesame seed to throw the 
watermelon.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional Chinese medicine:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Take the traditional culture as the 
	method; </li>
  <li>Is the overall macroscopic 
	research, closely unifies the world person, the climate, relationship 
	between living things and the seasons, the disease's outward manifestation 
	closely unifies, natural environment, social environment, individual 
	condition close union, as well as overall immunity; </li>
  <li>Emphasizes the disease and fall ill 
	individual difference;</li>
  <li>Because person, 
	when, acts as circumstances permit diagnosis and treatment principle;</li>
    <li>The medicine is the two gathers is 
	one, doctor may nimbly grasp and use tens of thousands of matches (this 1., 
	also sufficed opposite party to envy);</li>
    <ul>
  <li>Therefore some people must 
	supplement the book on Chinese medicine, worried it cannot follow the 
	development, actually too worries; </li>
</ul>
</ul>
  <li>Western medical skill:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>(Modern people's knowledge or 
	technology) as the method (often attends to one thing without losing track 
	of another thing) take the modern science;</li>
  <li>To is concrete in the research 
	scope, partial and the microscopic aspect develops (only sees trees not to 
	see forest); </li>
  <li>Emphasizes the disease and fall ill 
	general character;</li>
  <li>Lacks in macroscopic, aspect the 
	and so on whole and tendency research;</li>
  <li>
  The medicine is the separation, doctor basic is unable to decide the medicine 
	the choice, only can sit and watch it to become, waits for the 
	pharmaceutical factory the product;<ul>
  <li>

  Or west said doctor is only the pharmaceutical 
	factory salesman, is a pharmaceutical factory staff member, works for it;<ul>
  <li>
  Only is accurately uses these toxicants to their 
	request according to the label;</li>
  <li>
  Because of to the germ most effective share 
	quantity, is in front of a patient lethal dose spot;</li>
  <li>They do not need the very high thought, so long as complies with then; </li>
</ul>
  <li>
  This for is not good with traditional culture &quot;is has nothing to do with one 
	another for excellent doctor&quot;, is no comparison between them;</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This is a difference, also ten ten thousand 8,000 miles! </p>
	<p>Some principles cannot pass along with the time change, like Chinese 
	medicine penetrating judgment and curative effect. </p>
  <p>Has more than 2,250 
	years historical Dujiang weirs, is located upstream the Chinese Yangtze 
	River branch Minjiang River, take pilots, automatic accent Hong without the 
	dam, discharge of silt, the irrigation enjoys a good reputation the whole 
	world as the characteristic, has benefitted the irrigation area surely 
	people, from this time on the Chengdu plain flood and drought from the 
	person, does not know the famine, Shi Ch'eng&quot;day government office&quot;. Sichuan 
	therefore &quot;land of abundance&quot; fine reputation. Was now in the world only 
	preserves, take pilots without the dam as the characteristic ancient times 
	water conservation systems engineering. This ancient hydraulic engineering 
	had more than 2,250 years history, by the global water conservation 
	reputation is &quot;in human water conservation history milestone&quot;.</p>
  <p>A.D. previous 250 
	years, Sichuan's governor is the Suchuan county defends Li Pingwei to cause 
	hydro energy of the Minjiang River for a long time stably to moisten the 
	Chengdu plain, led the coast common people to repair Dujiang weirs. In order 
	to guarantee its water conservation system experience long time does not 
	fade, Dujiang weirs from fixes the date, has persisted strict &quot;the annual 
	repairs&quot; system: Whenever the winter waterless season, in canal head dams 
	the current the Minjiang River with the bamboo raft, by carries on the 
	service to Dujiang weirs, to the next year spring, will tear down again the 
	bamboo raft, &quot;will turn on the water the&quot; irrigation. The North Song Synasty, 
	official officially Qingming Festival will decide as &quot;to turn on the water 
	festival&quot;, and hold grand sacrificial offering activity, both &quot;will offer 
	sacrifice to water&quot; and &quot;to offer sacrifice to Li Ping&quot;, also the desire day 
	blesses the good harvest year also clear to reveal the current dynasty 
	prosperous times.</p>
  <p>The Li ice fathers and 
	sons, with the so simple principle, have solved the water supply flood 
	prevention problem, simultaneously century ten thousand th still were 
	allowed to use, not only so, how maintained also has is clear about / the 
	correct guidance. The modern scientist / experts also have what feelings?</p>
	<p>Once at any time, the modern science representative, English generation 
	of you already gradually were deviating a mole of law. Because the product 
	renews the main goal enhances the efficiency, but in light of the present 
	circumstances, alone depended upon infinite enhances the basic frequency 
	already no longer to be able to realize this goal. Circuit design more and 
	more small, caused the PC interior the radiation question more and more to 
	be also difficult to solve, creates the cost to be more and more high. The 
	&quot;frequency enhances the benefit which brings, has been already 
	counterbalanced by the hot question. The &quot;technology forever is the driving 
	force which the productive forces and the society develops is at. Dozens of 
	years ago, when the semiconductor technology are also more is one kind of 
	invention creation, innovates take the technology itself indeed can suffice 
	as a central mole of law effectively to stimulate technical the progress and 
	enterprise's development. For dozens of years, in under mole of law 
	direction, English generation of your time and time again user frequency 
	numeral achievement own hegemonic position, also took a higher position the 
	&quot;basic frequency is the quick&quot; concept ingrained instills into for certainly 
	the majority consumer. And even has well-known IT to write the hand to have 
	the satire in the article to express &quot;even links my two sirs all to say the 
	P4 basic frequency was high has accessed the net can quick 1.&quot;. </p>
	<p>This and is the doctor practicing western medicine how could similar, 
	this this is possibly a history, is the heartless history, is the historical 
	examination. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Some things are cannot use, like philosophy which the concrete numeral 
		expressed, philosophy; </li>
        <ul>
  <li>The Book of Changes is the philosophy, the Chinese medicine also is the 
		philosophy, is the high level philosophy, is may the universally 
		applicable philosophy;</li>
  <li>The different thing should use the different standard to observe and the 
		appraisal, the Chinese medicine and the Western medical skill although 
		all are uses for to treat an illness, but the two is distanced really 
		far;</li>
        <ul>
  <li>The Chinese medicine may lead troops to go to war (like resorts to arms 
		with medicine), the Western medical skill may?</li>
  <li>The Chinese medicine may the senate dynasty ask the politics (for 
		excellent doctor for is not good), the Western medical skill may?</li>
  <li>The Chinese medicine may simultaneously be the financial expert, the 
		Western medical skill may? </li>
  <li>The Chinese medicine may provide the business decision, the Western 
		medical skill may?</li>
  
  <li>The Chinese 
		medicine may provide the travel safe consultation (gentleman not to set 
		up under danger wall), the Western medical skill may? </li>
  
  <li>The Chinese medicine may provide the geomancy to select the dwelling, 
		the architectural design, the Western medical skill may... ...</li>
        </ul>
	<li>Chinese ancient astronomy how? Its achievement 
	/ scientific data, cannot 
		compare the Western medical skill or the modern is scientific 
		difference, may make its command to blush with shame? The ancient 
		astronomy is may use the numeral to express;</li>
  <li>Beautiful, is one kind of very ambiguous adjective, certainly does not have 
	the quota, because beautifully has very many kinds: Iced cold, fresh 
	refined, the instinct innocent wicked, cunningly and unreasonably does as 
	one pleases, intelligently cunning, the sentiment deep righteousness is 
	heavy;</li>
    <ul>
  <li>If does not have the very high literature attainments but also to have to 
	describe when an extremely beautiful girl, only has shames the moon and 
	flowers, beautiful woman, the national beauty day fragrance and causes the 
	downfall of a nation the beautiful woman and so on, at most adds on six 
	palaces cosmetics not to have the color; </li>
  <li>Only is describes the beautiful science with this? We also hoped beautiful is 
	may the formula computation or surveys with the instrument, but beautiful is 
	only beautiful after all, is beautiful is the perception, but is not the 
	rationality; </li>
</ul>
  <li>The laughter, the ancient commonly used &quot;oriole leaves Gu&quot; and the &quot;young 
	swallow turns over to nest&quot; to describe the sound the delight. But describes 
	the sound science with this? Because also does not have the quota! </li>
  <li>Subcritical class with supercritical class resolution flattery, but reality 
	and the dreamland division of, also should judge with that equation only 
	then quite is scientific?</li>
  <li>What all wants the scientific data, whether always somewhat lacks the ability 
	to do what one would like place? Very many things are cannot want certainly, 
	one-sideds wish; </li>
</ul>
  <li>The Western medical skill so-called scientific data, is the digital 
		game much, its theory can unceasingly weed through the old to bring 
		forth the new, several years have been able to change, this only can 
		explain it is not mature; </li>
        <ul>
    <li>Is similar to the cancer to have to wait till the last stage or the fist 
		is big when can discover is same, this is they directs to think the 
		arrogant scientific data;</li>
        <li>At the same time, this very moment, also only can be the scientific data 
		which regularly reinspects, and not accurate effective treatment plan;<ul>
    <li>Regularly reinspects, the regular observation, then tells you to have 
		how many changes; </li>
    <li>Had a look any place steadily, also has gone to any place, so long as 
		saw, was allowed to guarantee excised it;</li>
        <ul>
    <li>Will have the question the organ 
	excision, will be extremely is not responsible for / or the extremely ignorant 
	method, how many will a person also have to be allowed to cut? </li>
	<li>Why isn't allowed to consider 
	repairs it? Prevents it?</li>
  </ul>
    <li>After excises, stops bleeding the seam good wound, delivers to the 
		surgery table, namely the expression surgery succeeds (lives is leaving 
		surgery table = surgery success); </li>
    <li>The wound will heal later to be allowed to leave the hospital, doctor 
		kindly delivered the patient to go out the hospital front door, the 
		racket pats his shoulder, told him to say: No problem, every half year 
		inspects a time, if steadily, again came back shears; </li>
        <ul>
    <li>I agreed surgery itself, said to the doctor practicing western medicine 
		already is not a question, likes the arrow tail saw up to be same, easy; </li>
    <li>But the arrow tail saw up = arrow takes out = the arrow wound to 
		convalesce? Certainly, the arrow does not take out the wound also is can 
		good, but the arrow = feels uneasy in in vivo? </li>
  </ul>
    <li>Similarly, the marrow transplants the surgery to succeed = the marrow to 
		transplant successfully = cures? The answer is negative! <ul>
    <li>Whether you will know surgery later the question? Repel and anti- repel 
		question? The immunity twenty years not yet restore question? As well as 
		survival percentage question... ...</li>
  </ul>
    <li>The very many times populace can mislead, or many doctors practicing 
		western medicine itself own are not clear, actually this is a beautiful 
		misunderstanding; </li>
    <li><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">The surgery succeeds = 
		convalesces, certainly is not suitable the cancer!</span> Possibly 
		merely is suitable for the general appendicitis'typhlitis surgery, 
		even is not suitable the silt type gallstone surgery;</li>
    <li>This is doctor the behavior? Since is wants to help but not be able to, 
		why doesn't improve or the self-criticism self-criticism? </li>
    <li>So big flaw, so big theoretically flaw, so big clinical on flaw!</li>
  </ul>
    <li>The stethoscope, the sphygmomanometer, three big conventional, the 
		electrocardiogram, the supersonic wave, the X- beam data is accurate, is 
		approximately the value or certainly to the value? The equipment long 
		time proofreads time?</li>
        <ul>
    <li>First said in three big conventions blood count: Will use the patient 
		blood which the syringe will extract, will dilute according to the 
		proportion, under the microscope in the number certain area this blood 
		cell number, will press the scale adjustment again for the corresponding 
		this blood cell number, will write in the lab test report, will bring 
		back for west doctor, whether the contrast normal data (has certain 
		span) to understand the patient anemia or the infection;<ul>
    <li>If requests a specialer inspection, seeks some type the cell, also is 
		goes by the book, so concocts, only is only counts by this type cell; </li>
    <li>Precise, to is not certainly precise! Besides the artificial factor, the 
		flow itself factor also can affect counts;</li>
	<li>Survey digital itself also certainly, is not only a proportion, a 
		divisor, moreover the difference is enormous;</li>
  </ul>
    <li>Electrocardiogram: Through to the body surface electric potential 
		record, observes its graph corresponding wave mode in the corresponding 
		place appearance, decides normally or not; </li>
        <ul>
    <li>It finally just like you know, definitely is not precise, also is not 
		certainly to; If sees a profile on more than meter long 
		electrocardiograms papers to be unusual, also only some, this time 
		possibly is the question is at, also possibly is false alarm;</li>
    
    <li>Thereupon three ladders experiments for this, namely the 
		electrocardiogram normal did not express the heart is normal, the 
		electrocardiogram not normal did not express the heart is not normal;</li>
    <li>Pitiful does not know not knowing; </li>
  </ul>
  	<li>Therefore said: The auxiliary administrative offices inspection unusual not 
	necessarily is exceptionally, the auxiliary administrative offices 
	inspection normal not necessarily is normal (this is doctor practicing 
	western medicine's diagnostics teaches); </li>
  </ul>
    <li>We did not say too specialized, said relaxed; </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Said standard time, the Greenwich Mean Time is divides the Earth for the 
		different time zone, the time zone is basic is a division, is regular, 
		but this standard time zone also does not have the division, also has 
		twists place;</li>
    <li>The modern standard all has an adjustment the question, like the time, 
		the weight, the length, or tuning fork and so on, all need to use a 
		standard standard to adjust, moreover is fixed time carries on; </li>
        <ul>
    <li>This has had a question, namely usually said the science standard, or 
		the international standard did not know what refers to? Was equipment 
		which refers usually uses, or just used the equipment which the world 
		standard adjusted after just returns to, or with with adjusted the use the 
		standard standard equipment?</li>
    <li>The modern scientists use the equipment was the equipment which usually 
		uses, or just used the equipment which the world standard adjustment 
		later just will return to, or with with adjusted the use the standard 
		standard equipment?</li>
    <li>Also also has the standard the standard standard equipment? Namely uses 
		to adjust the commonly used equipment the standard equipment, whether 
		has need to be preciser or the standard equipment adjusts? </li>
    <li>In the adjustment place is standard, but in the different elevation, the 
		temperature, the barometric pressure, the latitude and longitude can 
		otherwise have the diversity?</li>
    <li>China has a literary reference is, spear of by the child, attacks shield 
		of the child;</li>
  </ul>
	<li>The sea woods fort measured does not permit the principle to promulgate to 
	us: Some granule position and the momentum cannot simultaneously survey, to 
	parameter survey Viet Nam, because surveys the disturbance, another 
	parameter then can change does not permit; The time, the space and the 
	matter all are not may be clear about the determination, we not impossible 
	completely accurate survey universe present condition. Namely measured 
	itself has disturbed, already was disturbs;</li>
    <ul>
    <li>You thought surveys the object weight with the hand several 9 grain of 
	sesame seeds and with balance (one kind the installment. Respectively hangs 
	a small dish in the bar beginnings and ends, an end puts the goods which 
	must call, an end puts the weights. When bar sub- balance, the weights 
	weight is the thing heavy) called 9g sesame seed that way is more precise? 
	Can be loyal to the original intention? 9 grain of sesame seeds are 9 grain 
	of sesame seeds, does not need to discuss the precision; 9g sesame seed 
	troublesome, the 9g sesame seed on definitely is not the 9g sesame seed, 
	because disturbs the factor too are many, needs to know how many errors the 
	permission precision does have, positive and negative 20%?</li>
	<li>General situation so, human's living specimen organization really;</li>
  </ul>
	<li>Too has enforced some, said to the human body surface description or the 
		survey;<ul>
		<li>The Chinese medicine is with with the body dimension, namely describes 
		&quot;inch&quot; significance with the human body itself proportion, like in 
		&quot;Guan&quot; in on wrist across to the grain two inches;</li>
    
		<li>This method to height size people all extremely accurate, definitely 
		compared to uses the ruler which in the market condition buys back 
		accurately, namely is more accurate than the modern standard, or 
		compared to modern standard modern age;</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Everybody sees the Chinese countryside to sell the pork? They may 
		accurate under you need all at once weight, not many somewhat also many 
		somewhat, also did not know they use any are the standard, but 
		definitely is not the international standard, only is similarly easy to 
		use or is easier to use, economical, also is said the matter does not 
		have certainly rightly;</li>
	
  </ul>
    <li>If the like this data is the scientific data, the modern scientists said 
		is 100 step smiles 50 step (is not 50 step smiles 100 step);<ul>
    <li>Because their value itself is approximately the value, approximately 
		value;</li>
        <ul>
    <li>Only is they unequal for approximately the value, but is called the 
		science the data (naming); </li>
    <li>Again as necessary adds on &quot;internationally recognized&quot;, sufficiently 
		fools these to be bewildered the sickness which but also turns to any 
		doctor one can find when critically ill, thereupon west the 
		pharmaceutical factory also has the commission reward, is similar to 
		insures broker's commission;</li>
    <li>Through each kind of media, lets the people think this is the good 
		thing;</li>
    <li>Through each kind of legislation, removes other medical methods, 
		guarantees its business the profit; </li>
        <ul>
    <li>Everybody whether or not 
	remembers these people which the before / present receives the protection 
	money, their domain to their importance, whether had the understanding the 
	smile;</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
    <li>May the doctor practicing western medicine use approximately the value, 
		why the Chinese medicine not to be allowed to use approximately the 
		value? </li>
    <li>West the medical approximately value is a science, why center is the 
		medical value approximately unscientific?</li>
	<li>Doctor practicing western medicine's data is accurate? Exposed has also 
		been able to let the person know whether to laugh or cry, error big, was 
		sufficiently dumfounded, if blood white cell count; </li>
	<li>If alternating current voltage 220v ±20% is normal, this is the 
		scientific error, normal, may accept error, natural error;</li>
	<li>This data is they frequently uses to fool the person the data! 
		Scientific evidence! When they want strangles the Chinese medicine the 
		time, wants to suppress has the threat to their market Chinese medicine 
		time, only must a gently data confirmation then, certainly they not be 
		able to look / either unintentionally or sedulously neglects the final 
		curative effect, simply does not propose the mortality rate, really did 
		not know this is any authorities; </li>
	<li>The Chinese medicine rigorousness, the China traditional culture 
		rigorousness, is certainly does not permit so sloppy, the thick hand 
		thick foot, manufactures in a rough way;</li>
	<li>If the Chinese medicine Tang Fang quantity and the proportion, are led 
		far astray by a slight error loses the great distance, also how could 
		tolerates ±20% error, this is the modern doctors practicing western 
		medicine understands with difficulty, or is inconceivable, 
		inconceivable;</li>
	<li>The doctor practicing western medicine could not do did not express the 
		Chinese medicine also could not do, west could not treat did not express 
		the Chinese medicine also could not govern; Now in market condition 
		so-called certainly sickness, only is the doctor practicing western 
		medicine says, certainly did not express these really are certainly 
		sickness, also did not express the Chinese medicine approves of it, did 
		not express the patient should believe it, willingly would rather 
		listens henceforth to decide;</li>
        <ul>
    <li>The doctor practicing western 
	medicine medicine deceased person is legitimate, because he is only 
	legitimate, some people have questioned the so high mortality rate? The such 
	high mortality rate is reasonable?</li>
	<li>Its theory basis is whether same 
	with other physical laws, has the revision either the denial possibility or 
	is essential? The answer is firmly; </li>
	<li>Same year sold the opium in 
	China, now is not in the thief shouted caught the thief; </li>
  </ul>
	<li>The scientists drive when science? Because also is the divisor side, 
		satisfies the need is away from also is only the divisor, approximately 
		approximately; </li>
	<li>Much less is the Chinese medicine which the doctor practicing western 
		medicine teaches, perhaps has inherited the doctor practicing western 
		medicine clothes earthen bowl Chinese medicine;</li>
  </ul>
    <li>The Western medical skill therefore can base in the society, monopolizes 
		in this profession, only is the political factor, the social factor;<ul>
    <li>Is their public relations level or the skill is wise, the dove occupies 
		the magpie nest, and understood the solicit assists to induce the 
		legislation to protect oneself (likes in front of patient surgery to 
		need to sign same); </li>
    <li>The traditional culture connotation, causes the Chinese medicine not to 
		be able to blow own horn, but Western medical skill carrying out always 
		enjoys;</li>
        <ul>
    <li>Their abundant fund, has grasped the media, has misled the patient;</li>
    <li>They the rumour, has all over the sky created the pseudomorph to the

        <ul>
    <li>Is only very many people, including the Chinese nation descendants, the

    <li>The Chinese medicine successor, the number standard has forgotten the

    <ul>
    <li>Because they also know oneself, 
	saw with own eyes the paper-insulated fire, therefore some places doctor

    <ul>
    <li>We wait to look at the situation

    <li>When thought if the Chinese

	did not know looks for time which any matter does... ... </li>
  </ul>
    <li>A 100 year ago conclusion: </li>
    <ul>
    <li>100 years ago, German scientist 
	feld &quot;the nerve non-renewable&quot; assertion caused the nerve the research area 
	to experience the nearly hundred years blank! Facing the brain illness 
	neurotrosis, the doctor practicing western medicine only can use expands the 
	blood vessel, dissolves the thrombus, invigorates the blood to pass winds 
	and so on the method carries on the treatment in view of &quot;blood vessel of 
	brain&quot;, after expected the patient passes the dangerous period to be able 
	the nature restoration; </li>
	<li>Facing brain illness suffering, 
	the doctor practicing western medicine is continuously helpless, becomes 
	historical the confusion;</li>
	<li>Until twenty centuries later periods, along with the molecular biology 
	development, (GM) succeeds to the ganglion Gansu fat withdraws with the 
	application, only then makes the doctor practicing western medicine to 
	realize suffers injury after the nerve is the ganglion Gansu fat which true 
	is deficient, from this time on only then has broken since long ago the 
	doctor practicing western medicine the deadlock and &quot;which thorny not whips 
	facing the neurotrosis the nerve non-renewable&quot; conclusion; 
	</li>
	<li>
  	Ignominious? Pitiful? Laughable? The question is smiles obtains?</li>
  </ul>
          <li>Here has two 
		interesting news: </li>
        <ul>
    <li>One is the modern 
	science representative, Microsoft's &quot;expert called the loophole repairs the 
	tonic method not good government to be supposed to subsidize the software to 
	develop&quot;;</li>
	<li>Another one is the frontier science representative, US's &quot;patriot missile 
	does not divide the enemy I to open fire&quot;;</li>
  </ul>
	<li>To the science worship, blindly 
	follows, itself should also be blindly believed in, namely blurry believed;</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Whether the self-praise speech 
	does need thought? Pseudo-science or false science?</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
    <li>We may hit the arena as necessary 
	with the doctor practicing western medicine under the fair situation;</li>
    <ul>
		<li>Has an extraordinary personality 
	to say: The practice is examines the truth the standard;</li>
		<li>Another extraordinary personality 
	also has said: No matter the Black Cat white cat, seizes the mouse is the 
	good cat;</li>
    <ul>
			<li>Has cured the patient is the 
	science, is really scientific;</li>
			<li>Has cured the patient is the 
	truth, is the hard truth; </li>
			<li>Otherwise, said again pleasantly to hear, also only said, finally also is 
	the chart poor dagger sees, reveals one's true colors, likes a non- standard 
	service;</li>
	  </ul>
	</ul>
    <li>That west the hospital, that west 
	doctor the scientific data which misdiagnoses them, the science recording 
	has publicized? I have not seen, you have seen?</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Doctor practicing western 
	medicine's procedure / west law is: Let doctor practicing western medicine 
	manage the doctor practicing western medicine;</li>
    <li>This to is fair? To public, to 
	patient, to society, to Chinese medicine?</li>
	<li>But, this is the present standard, is the recognition standard, is the 
	international standard! The question is we need to follow such standard? The 
	Chinese medicine needs with from such standard? </li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>Some people believed that, needs to 
	carry on to the traditional Chinese doctor educates again, to fully uses the 
	Western medical skill the achievement and the material, then studies the 
	Western medical skill the insufficiency. Or utilizes the western science, 
	separates the Chinese native medicine the medical special characteristic, 
	and formulates a standard in view of the raw material for medicine 
	ingredient; </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Everybody has seen the non- mule 
	non- horse? Sits the well view day, knows the immensity of heaven and earth; </li>
    <li>Should better not have to let 
	this person speak keeps a promise, otherwise is the ice age arrival, because 
	they too young, Western medical skill too young;</li>
  </ul>
  <li>As a result of some kind of reason, 
	some / many / all traditional Chinese medicine college, the Chinese medicine 
	hospital, center doctors all are using the stethoscope, the 
	sphygmomanometer, even three big conventions, supersonic wave, X- beam, 
	nuclear magnetic resonance... ... ! The Chinese medicine what saves, is sad;</li>
    <li>And what is more, has artificially 
	catches up with fashionably, must connect rails with the international 
	standard, must use the international approval the form to reflect the 
	Chinese native medicine contains chemical composition the type and the 
	quantity modern analysis technology vindicated oneself (for example 
	&quot;fingerprint atlas&quot; and so on), hoped for the Chinese native medicine which 
	is not clear puzzled the effective component manages for a long time &quot;ID 
	card&quot;; </li>
    <ul>
  <li>But does not go to the flowered 
	time in the actual research;</li>
  <li>Only knew the Chinese native 
	medicine is China has the independent intellectual property rights, minority 
	several has one of international comparison superiority industrial, but to 
	holds the family heirloom also is unclear in the hand in, wants to dress up 
	settles on the idea, therefore has eagerly to look at person's complexion; </li>
    
  <li>Frequently is 
	the science, left science, right science. The science also has any to be 
	great, takes the chicken feather when signal arrow, full tasteless. 
	Calculated science itself is a science, who knew any is the pseudo-science, 
	any also is the false science. Without in front of the science how are the 
	age people also live?</li>
    <ul>
  <li>The modern market economy did not 
	know there?</li>
</ul>
  <li>
	As soon as used &quot;science&quot; the method to manage 
	and the development Chinese medicine, the Chinese medicine survives in name 
	only, since because the millennium the Chinese medicine has been used to it 
	&quot;to lack the scientific standard for a long time the standard and the 
	quality control method&quot; environment! The fact had also proven this law is 
	reliable and feasible;</li>
    <li>Or said Shen Nong tastes all the 
	various grassy plants the time writes the book, modern great &quot;science&quot; 
	whether or not writes two to come out has a look? The request will not be 
	high, is completed later not to change then; </li>
  <li>Modern &quot;the science&quot; definition 
	either the tendency are &quot;&quot; or the &quot;demonstration which splits out with the 
	instrument on monitor&quot;, colored compared to black and white high tech, sad, 
	simply was deceives the common people, the level too is pitiful; </li>
</ul>
	<li>The international standard, the national behavior, the present law not 
	necessarily comprehensive or are correct, the legal permission not 
	necessarily is right, must look the standpoint says:</li>
    <ul>
  <li>The cigarette poisons to the human body is not inferior to the narcotics, 
	but many countries looked on the money share, has not certainly forbidden, 
	although it poisons is the recognition!</li>
	<li>Same year the English sold the narcotics in China, equally also was the 
	national behavior, was the national support;</li>
	<li>The very many places rental car, between the first back row seat common 
	installs the steel made of iron railing, this is the government behavior, 
	the national behavior, is legitimate, is the legal rule! The question is any 
	law and is correct or not. Your excellency thought that, why on the vehicle 
	has the security aerocyst, why the display board and are the steering wheel 
	soft? This is for be safe, for passenger's safety! The proper authorities 
	are adding the hard railing time also has thinks of passenger's safety? When 
	worried about vehicle or accident time, passenger's head and the steel and 
	iron railing hurriedly bumps into the time result! Simultaneously these 
	rental cars gates only can hold by the driver control the switch outside, if 
	the driver cared about center cannot open the gate, but the vehicle has 
	cooked meals, how should the passenger from place? This similarly is the 
	government behavior, is legitimate, also is said legitimate certainly is 
	correct by no means, driver's safety is needs to consider, passenger's 
	safety should neglect? How on the street should the pedestrian?</li>
	<li>The war also is the national behavior;</li>
</ul>

	<p style="margin-bottom: -19px">When Western

     <li>According to serves as the

<p>
	In in the feudal superstition three generations, the same surname should not

	Doctor practicing western medicine courtyard itself has concentrated the

  <li>
	
  This discovery is possibly helpful to points out the development method of

  <li>
  Recent discovery makes one suspect at present uses multi- Pakistan amine

    <li>Canadian passing society Toronto 
2002-6-11 electricity: Doctor frequently excises the womb treat illness, also 
accepts the womb excision surgery woman, the ovary is reached by the 
nonessential excision 72%;</li>
<ul>
  <li>An item recently announced the 
	memoir said that, the Canadian woman performed the excessively many 
	nonessential wombs excision surgery, doctor has taken this kind of surgery 
	the benign womb disease a method of treatment, but was in fact may use 
	outside the surgery the way treatment.</li>
  <li>In fact, in 35 year old of above 
	Canadian woman had 22% to perform the womb excision surgery, but majority 
	was does not have the definite reason. </li>
  <li>Makes the phenomenon compared to 
	the womb excision ratio which one pays attention is, doctor when excises 
	patient's womb also the association has excised patient's ovary; </li>
    <ul>
  <li>
  In patient which below 40 years old the woman accepts the womb excision 
	method, 72% has lost the ovary; </li>
  <li>In very many this kind of cases of 
	illness, besides endometrium shifting, why is very difficult to imagine all 
	people all also one and excises 40 years old by the maid patient's ovary; </li>
  <li>When you inquired when why 
	gynecology department doctor so does handle affairs, they can reply that, 
	they soon entered the menopause, the at that time they do not need these 
	ovaries again;</li>
  <li>In fact for this reason woman's 
	healthy ovary while convenient excises 40 years old below, is in any event 
	difficult circle it to say, because the Canadian women equally must only 
	then enter the menopause to 52 years old about;</li>
  <li>This data is shocking, even does 
	not have in the medicine the necessity; </li>
  <li>After the ovary is excised, not 
	only urges the woman to enter the menopause ahead of time, enters 
	prematurely certainly passes through the stage, moreover because the female 
	hormone secretion quantity play reduces, also can cause osteoporosis 
	sickness, even initiates the heart disease, and often follows losing sleep 
	which menopause appears with the intermittent fever;</li>
</ul>
  <li>Composes this memoir the expert 
	group people in charge said that, has obtained the rapid development in the 
	medicine science and technology, has the more treatments method to be 
	possible to supply choice today, this kind rigid by old style method 
	treatment womb disease phenomenon, causes she remembered long ago doctor 
	when the execution abdomen surgery, is often automatic conveniently 
	patient's appendix also one and cuts away. </li>
  <li>The above statistical data is 
	collects in Ontario Province, but University of Toronto medicine network 
	woman healthy business person in charge Doctor Shi T'uhua extrapolated, the 
	Canadian other areas situations are also similar;</li>
  <li>In the report suggested strengthens

  <li>Supplemented the hormone therapy 
	waste surpasses 1,000 hundred million Yuan, but also has harmed several 
	million women's lives!</li>
    <ul>
	<li>The American country health head 
	office (NIH) on July 9, 2002 announced that, after passes through eight 
	years half research to summarize, accepts the Hormone Replacement Therapy is 
	called HRT woman, because takes the mix 
	
	estrogen for a long time with Progestin the breast cancer, the blood embolism, 
	the stroke and the heart attack probability can increase (increase to suffer 
	from trouble breast cancer danger then already knowns by everybody, but 
	national health head office still so), therefore this bureau has terminated 
	the Prempro medicine experiment which carries on to 16,600 women, And with 
	the woman which uses this therapy gives the warning to doctor;</li>
    <ul>
		<li>US has 6 million women to take this 
	kind of mix hormone, some is the short-term takes, reduces the menopause dry 
	and hot and other is ill should the symptom; But some is the long-term use, 
	because many doctors believed HRT can prevent the heart disease, 
	osteoporosis sickness, is helpful the woman to maintain the health; </li>
  		
		<li>According to 
	NIH the entire American first large-scale research which does in view of the 
	HRT effect Women's Health Initiative, WHI, takes Prempro for a long time, 
	makes originally the healthy woman heart attack probability to increase 29%, 
	the stroke probability increases 41%, results in the breast cancer 
	probability to increase 26%;</li>
		<li>The management is National Heart, 
	Lung And Blood Institute association president Dr. Claude Lenfant pointed 
	out that, simultaneously takes the hormone and the progestin to suffers from 
	the profit which the trouble cardiovascular disease and the cancer degree of 
	hazard greatly surpasses any may take advantage of this obtains. </li>

	<li>Mai Mashih 
	reaches the university Dr. Sonia Anand and Dr. Salim Yusuf makes the 
	commentary in the Canadian medicine association periodical which August 20, 
	2002 publishes, refers to every year whole world flower to be direct and the 
	non- direct cost in HRT probably has dozens of hundred million Yuan, in the 
	past for 20 years accumulated the disbursement surpassed 1,000 hundred 
	million Yuan.</li>
    <ul>
		<li>The above numeral synthesized 
	several million HRT prescription charges for medicine, treats the HRT 
	medicine to cause illness complication the and so on breast cancer, heart 
	disease, stroke and blood clot expense.</li>
    <li>Dr. Sonia Anand and other experts all thought the 
	federation government subsidizes, synthesizes 16,600 Americas woman clinical 
	experiment material the research, has the most authoritative conclusion. 
	Takes the Estrogen and the Progestin synthesizes the therapy the danger too 
	to be high, urges the government to shift to an earlier time the termination 
	for 15 years research, just crossed for five years on sends out the warning 
	to doctor and the patient.</li> 
		
		<li>This research discovered ten 
	thousand women after a HRT year, can increase eight breast cancers, seven 
	heart diseases, eight strokes, as well as 18 person of legs or the lungs 
	appear the blood clot.</li>
		<li>The elegant cedar said that, this should awaken the government to allocate 
	more the research funds. She felt treats as the menopause the disease to 
	come the prescription treatment the responsibility to be supposed to share 
	by doctors.</li>
		<li>&quot;This is the natural ageing process, but the medical arena public figure 
	actually said should take medicine the government. In fact, only in the 
	extremely special situation, the female sickness talented person needs to 
	supplement the hormone therapy, but we urge some women to have the 
	dependence to this therapy.&quot; </li>
	</ul>
	
	<li>The Canadian cancer association (on 
	October 10, 2002 the Toronto Xingdao) urges the woman to discuss the hormone 
	substitution therapy with them doctor the advantageses and disadvantageses, 
	with considers the habits and customs and its the family history. The woman 
	uses the hormone substitution therapy (HRT) to prevent the long-term 
	disease, can increase the trouble breast cancer the opportunity.</li>
    <ul>
		<li>The American Women's Health 
	Initiative, stopped in the research early time, basically is because the 
	hormone substitution therapy was discovered can increase approximately 25% 
	opportunity to suffer from the breast cancer, simultaneously has the sign to 
	demonstrate can increase the heart disease, the stroke and the lung 
	accumulates the blood the opportunity. </li>
		<li>The cancer association inferior 
	poem and nurtures spatial branch administration inspector general Barbara 
	Kaminsky to indicate that, this research key point, lies in pointed out the 
	long-term use hormone substitution therapy is takes the prevention disease 
	one method, but is not uses for to relieve the menopause the symptom.</li>
		<li>&quot;Penetrates this research the 
	enlightenment, we urge the woman to discuss with them doctor use the hormone 
	to substitute for the therapy the advantage and the fault. Although the 
	hormone substitution therapy may relieve the menopause in the short-term the 
	illness, but woman's habits and customs and its family history, also needs 
	in to make before the decision to perform to consider.&quot;</li>
		<li>The breast cancer researcher Dr. 
	Karen Gelmon to state that, in all situations, the medicine should and uses 
	the least time take the lowest effective dose as to be advantageous.</li>
		<li>The Canadian cancer association 
	also suggested that, may the natural method relieve the menopause symptom, 
	meets the sleep to puzzle, but the regular movement reduces the pressure and 
	the improvement whole body and mind;
		
		The practice fine jade gal or 
	contemplates relaxes;
		Takes nourishment vitamin the E supplement and the 
	attempt in just before going to sleep front drinks with small yellow

	<li>New conclusion disadvantageous 
	hormone substitution therapy (on March 19, 2003)</li>
    <ul>
		<li>A scale is biggest, the lasted most long research discovered that, this kind 
	of method of treatment certainly cannot bring a healthier result for 
	certainly the menstrual period woman, or brings more pleasure for them.&nbsp; 
		</li>
		<li>The researcher carries on the 
	comparison to 16,608 women weights group, one splice has received the 
	hormone substitution therapy, another group has only used the invalid 
	comfort medicine, finally discovered, former sleep sees the improvement, the 
	mood by no means better or less melancholy, or is easier to obtain the sex 
	life to satisfy. This research report on will publish in &quot;New England 
	Medicine Magazine&quot;.&nbsp; </li>
		<li>The UC glaxo peduncle in the 
	editor's note which writes for this report pointed out, the research 
	institute obtains the conclusion extremely is clear about, after certainly 
	menstrual period woman if has not appeared the so shape, does not have to 
	accept the hormone for the acting therapy, but can not but carry on this 
	kind of treatment also to be supposed to use the small dosage as far as 
	possible in the short-term. </li>
		<li>The hormone substitution therapy 
	will be uses the estrin and the progestin synthesis supplement treatment to 
	these in the womb excision surgery later woman. Believed in the former 
	medical arena that, this kind of treatment is helpful to prevent the heart 
	disease, the Rectal Cancer, and the age related mental drop. The medical 
	arena also believed that, this therapy may reduce the intermittent fever, 
	the robber perspiration and is melancholy and so on certainly the menstrual 
	period so shape. But this research discovery, accepts the hormone 
	substitution treatment woman's heart disease, the stroke, as well as 
	endanger life the thrombus forms the risk instead advances, although accepts 
	this kind of therapy woman's coxa bone fracture, Rectal Cancer proportion 
	drop. The research draws the conclusion, the hormone substitution therapy 
	shortcoming is bigger than the advantage.</li>

	according to a Tuesday, the most commonly used hormone substitution therapy 
	not only can increase menopause the woman to suffer from the trouble breast 
	cancer the danger, but also can let the use breast radiography examination 
	cancer change difficultly. </li>
		<li>The hormone substitution therapy 
	union estrin and the yellow body hormone, these two kind of hormones 
	confirmed has the improvement osteoporosis sickness function, but also may 
	reduce the hip department bone fracture and the carcinoma of uterus danger. 
	However because the findings showed, Hui pharmaceutical factory (Wyeth) the 
	&lt;WYE&gt; union estrin and yellow body hormone drugs Prempro can increase 
	suffers from the trouble ovarian cancer, the heart disease and the stroke

	research in 2002. </li>
		<li>This Tuesday publishes in the 
	Journal of the American Medical Association the on report, stopped the 
	research to a year ago doing has further analyzed, confirmed the use

		<li>In addition, this item by 
	California Torrance the Harbor-UCLA Research and Education Institute carries 
	on the research also discovered that, the cancer must develop a more serious

		<li>In in identical periodical another 
	memoir, Seattle Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center the researcher 
	indicated that, they discovered, even if does not have every day the yellow

		<li>The healthy expert Friday proposed

		<li>Supplemented the feminine in vivo hormone can reduce the face hotly blood

		<li>Although the sole estrin hormone supplemented already was confirmed can 
	increase the female to suffer from the trouble breast cancer the 
	probability. But the Cancer Research UK charity scientist's newest research 
	demonstration, the compound hormone supplemented the therapy -- namely 
	simultaneously supplemented the estrin and the progestagen actually is more 
	dangerous. </li>
		<li>&quot;With other types hormone supplemented the therapy compares, the compound

	(Valerie Beral) professor talks about like this at the press conference. 
		</li>
		<li>Through carries on to the English 
	exceed 100 ten thousand 50-64 year old women asked the volume and two years 
	tracing research, shell Luo and its the research team discovered the

	is sole estrin supplement therapy four times. </li>
		<li>Publishes in the medicine magazine 
	findings demonstrated in lancet (Lancet) that, with never accepts the woman 
	which the hormone supplemented to compare, these accept this treatment the 
	woman because the trouble breast cancer death probability has outdone 22%.</li>
		<li>&quot;Accepts the treatment time long, this risk higher, what is most obvious is in

	inspect this report, finally gave the warning in the beginning of this month 
	to the medical arena and the public.</li>
  <li>If patient in takes after this drugs, has the following symptom, should look 
	at doctor immediately: The face, the arm either the leg department paralysis 
	or myasthenia, speaks perhaps the vision suddenly has the question, has the 
	stroke danger as if; The leg department swelling, the chest ache, or 
	polypnoea is possibly the blood embolism omen; Abdominal pain, colporrhagia 
	then possibly are the womb tumor. </li>
</ul>
  <li>The medical new tendency, the slight illness exempts takes medicine (on 
	February 5, 2003 the Wall Street Journal)<ul>
  <li>More and more many doctors when treatment sickness adopts drug - free the 
	strategy, thought likes the cold, constipation and so on the sickness, may 
	use to drink the fluid medium, to eat textile fiber food to treat, therefore 
	non- is essential does not write the prescription; </li>
  <li>The more and more many medicine evidence demonstrated that, copes with fills 
	from the nose to the constipation and so on the ordinary disease, does not 
	eat the medicine to have the fashion quickly. Some research also questioned 
	the pharmacy sells whether the prepared medicine does really have the 
	effect. For example, English medicine periodical (British Medical Journal) 
	the conclusion is, the market condition many famous coughs medicines, 
	including Robitussin, Dimetapp, the effect are not certainly better than 
	placebo, but the cough medicine merchant questions this research the method; </li>
  <li>Some doctors thought the human body has the resistance disease mechanism, 
	should let the human body automatic resistance disease; For example has a 
	fever is the human body resistance inflammation way, but scratches the body 
	with the sponge and drinks the fluid medium to have to compare takes Arab 
	League Si P'iling the safety. Pennsylvania US therapist learns and American 
	internal medicine department medicine meeting Doctor Shi No said that, the 
	cold does eat the medicine, convalesces the time is same; </li>
  <li>Doctor worries the commonly used prescription drug and the prepared medicine 
	common side effect, although some is very slight. Doctor said that, the 
	Sudafed and so on nose suppositories possibly makes the sickness blood 
	pressure to advance, the Advil and so on antiphlogistic if the long-term 
	use, possibly causes the stomach ache and the stomach hemorrhage, but Arab 
	League Si P'iling a kind of medicine possibly causes to bleed, the sickness 
	if has time the hypertension also can be more difficult to control;</li>
  <li>While the medicine evidence change with medicine idea, the populace the 
	television drugs advertisement weary bombing, as well as saw pharmacy each 
	kind of drugs flood, also starts to the medicine to have the resisting point 
	of view; </li>
  <li>But even if is doctor which not easily writes the prescription also said, the 
	sickness cannot all resist to any medicine certainly, likes strep throat or 
	a more serious heart disease and so on needs to take medicine the treatment; </li>
  <li>At the same time, some populace take certain prepared medicine are for other 
	reasons, likes some person of clothing Arab League Si P'iling to prevent the 
	heart disease;</li>
  <li>Below is doctor to certain illness suggestions substitution therapies: Washes 
	the hot water bath and drinks the fluid medium to govern the nose to fill, 
	to drink adds the lemon and the honey hot tea governs the cough, little 
	drinks the coffee and the chocolate governs the headache, as well as drinks 
	the fluid medium, eats textile fiber food and the movement governs the 
	constipation;</li>

  <li>The antibiotic Canada will paste the aphorism label (on February 5, 2003 
	Associated Press Washington)</li>
    <ul>
  <li>Federation food and the medicine administrative bureau (FDA) indicated that, 
	all antibiotics drugs later will have to add in February 6, 2004 paste take 
	excessively many can have the antibiotic aphorism label, will remind doctor 
	not to overflow the nonessential antibiotic prescription notepaper; </li>
  <li>The aphorism label reminds doctor to have after to confirm the sickness 
	suffers the bacterium but must to have the same symptom the viral infection, 
	only then opens the antibiotic to the patient. Doctor often opens the 
	antibiotic to because of the viral initiation earache child, perhaps the 
	filterable virus causes cold or cough adult patient;</li>
  <li>The antibiotic only can kill the bacterium, is invalid to the virus. But 
	prevents and controls the center according to the disease (CDC) to estimate 
	that, entire American doctor draws up approximately in a hundred million 
	antibiotics prescriptions notepaper, approximately half number of is not 
	essential. FDA request antibiotic medicine Canada pastes the aphorism label, 
	must remind doctor to inform the patient truly to press the importance which 
	the instruction takes medicine. The patient should not take the antibiotic 
	to the other people takes, or because the condition improvement premature 
	stops the medicine; </li>
  <li>In fact, bacterium increasingly not antibiotic influence. Many common 
	infections have been unable with the traditional antibiotic like penicillin 
	to cure, some bacteria are even unable by the market condition in any 
	antibiotic to cope with. Whenever the antibiotic is used, the remnant live 
	bacterium can change more formidable also the expanded spread. </li>

  <li>This company research department senior director peaceful wiese expression, 
	under the computer help, to the live nerve cell in the electric current 
	signal research, will assist the scientists to have a more thorough 
	understanding regarding the brain operation, and further will develop like 
	the nerve disease and so on old age dementia treatment way. Peaceful wiese 
	said in an interview that, &quot;For example the researcher may put the cranial 
	nerve cell slice on the chip, again serves with the medicine to observe the 
	nerve to send out the signal the way, as well as cell to some specific 
	medicine response.&quot; This kind newly researches and develops biosensor chip

  <li>In a paper which International Solid - State Circuits Conference on publishes,

	constructs 16,000 to be responsible to monitor the electric current pulse 
	the sensory element. The nerve chip surface and spreads has electrolyte 
	nutrition solution, guarantees the nerve specific energy survival to get 
	down. In the nerve chip electric circuit in constructs has the 
	high-amplitude wave, enables the sensory element to be allowed to detect and 
	to process from is different cell layers the weak electric current signal, 
	collects the material again will transmit to the computer on, and will 
	transform the colored image using of for the analysis;</li>
  <li>
  Peaceful wiese pointed out that, the researcher at present only can use the 
	extremely small probe, in the survey cell electric current activity. This

  <li>This advice reminder public public figure takes stops pain and in front of the

  <li>The medical department points out the example:&nbsp; when the children suffer from

  <li>Of THERESE STUKEL this research

    <ul>
  <li>Believed the majority person is informed since childhood, the oil and the

	so, the next elementary and middle schools will teach the related curriculum 
	by no means the time, it is necessary to change &quot;the oil and the water may 
	automatically mix the synthesis emulsion under the certain condition&quot;;</li>
  <li>&quot;New Scientist&quot; the magazine newest issue reported that, Australian national 
	university's scholar Parshley, why are studying floats can automatically 
	many a little makes a mickle in the water surface oil, in this science is 
	called the phenomenon which long-rangehydrophobicforce affects, was one of 
	riddles which chemistry research has not up to now been able to untie;</li>
  <li>He when observation water surface big piece suspended oil dispersing when 
	shape change, accidentally discovered the hatred water surface appears the 
	micro hole which many slight air bubbles creates.The people early knew 
	exposes the volunteer fire brigade absorbs quota gas in the air, Parshley 
	therefore guessed in these slight air bubbles the gas, possibly is the quilt 
	&quot;the long-distance hatred water power&quot; extracts from the water; </li>
  <li>In order to prove this guess, he has the surface the oil the water repeatedly 
	to freeze melts again, the gas nearly completely has extracted the water in, 
	finally obtains the emulsion which Shui Hoyu automatically mixes becomes, it 
	extremely even moreover stable, static was very long also not once separates 
	the precipitation; </li>
  <li>Many scholars equally feel with Parshley to this discovery extremely 
	surprisedly, but they temporarily all say its reason why, specially studies 
	this kind of question the chemist hoped knew whether this phenomenon does 
	duplicate;</li>
  <li>To medicine chemical industry extremely important: Many colleagues indicated, 
	if this discovery duplicates the confirmation after the scientific 
	experiment, has the extremely vital economical significance to the medicine 
	and the chemical industry, for example many at present thought only can 
	dissolve Yu Yu the medicine, future will be allowed to change to gas-free 
	the body only the water to make the solvent, will cause the drugs cost 
	greatly to reduce; The young paint such chemical industry product, also

    <ul>
  <li>
  Because abuses the antibiotic, the American anti- medicine disease germ

  <li>
  The expert warns that, to 2004 summer, no matter is the penicillin or the 
	erythromycin, to nearly 40% pneumonia chain coccus strain stall. At present 
	this kind of chain coccus every year all must cause several thousand disease 
	and so on examples meningitises and pneumonia in US.  
  </li>
  <li>
  The experts analyzed have come to discover since the American 8 states data 
	that, in 1996 this kind of chain coccus 21.7% strains could the anti- 
	penicillin, this numeral rise to 1999 26.6%. At the same time, this kind of

  </li>
  <li>
  West participates in this research the expert reaps the strange talk, the

	provide more evidence.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>
  For many years the public health expert pointed out that, excessively uses the

  <li>The scientist formerly thought person's brain arrived 15 years old then to

<p>The present social system and the legal permission uses the Western medical

all is the medicine, only is each other circumstances is different. </p>
  
	<p>In the reality, the Chinese medicine must observe the standard or the

At present, the return nature, green expense consciousness starting, causes the

<p>Moreover, to is going to enter old age social a twenty century to say that,

<p>The patient is not does not have the thought, the use Chinese native medicine 
treats an illness has the glorious history and the rich experience, has the

<p>Many people thought &quot;Chinese medicine very

	unreal meaning (is not wise meaning). These people have included the people 
	which certainly the majority accepts the western education, even has 
	included a our quite part Chinese medicine jobholders, down to researcher 
	and administrative personnel. In fact the Chinese medicine is very 
	unreliable, not wrong, the medical source to is easy, namely the Chinese 
	medicine is produces from the Book of Changes, if not unreliable explained 
	we have not learned, has not inherited, should examine and the thought from

	character is 5000 civilization is at, also is we proud is at. We have the so 
	civilized culture, why isn't allowed to carry forward in predecessor's 
foundation, but is fickle. Inherits work which is we now must do. </p>
  <p>The international approval standard, has

  <p style="margin-bottom: -19">West doctor and

  </ul>
  <p>The ancient traditional Chinese medicine 
	actually already was in front of the modern science! Very many doctors 
	practicing western medicine did not understand the thing, certainly did not 
express does not exist or is unreasonable. </p>
	<p>This world needs the philosopher, but not 
	too needs the scientist which these superficialities or thinks oneself 
	infallible to manage, does not need them to make the decision-making, 
	otherwise is the tragedy. The fact has proven this 1.. The scientists like 
	seeing the defeat, has been used to it the defeat, does not mind the defeat, 
	because they may approach successfully in the defeat, namely the defeat is 
	mother of the success. The question is we do not like being defeated! The 
	people do not like being defeated! The patient does not like being defeated! 
Because is defeated is the meaning death.</p>
	<p>In 2003 US &quot;Science&quot; the magazine announced 
	03 year American 10 big science breakthroughs, among &quot;dark energy&quot; the 
	science proves into this year most important science development. The 
	scientist had proven &quot;the dark energy&quot; will be impels the mystical strength 
	which the universe forever without limits will accelerate to expand (namely 
	some kind of unclear strength to exist in universe, and will cause make 
	universe resistance gravitation galaxy to leave by acceleration mutually 
	phase-shift). The scientist now does not need to attempt again confirms the 
	dark energy existence, but is the attempt discovers the dark energy by 
	really to be composed, as well as it can tell us how many related universe 
birth and the evolution matter.</p>
	<p>The dark energy concept proposed by Einstein 
	in the beginning of 20th century, also is called &quot;the negative attraction&quot;. 
	&quot;The dark energy&quot; according to thought approaches the energy, but non- 
	matter. The scientist believed that, is same with the dark matter, &quot;the dark 
	energy&quot; constituted in the universe not an obviously part. Einstein proposed 
	&quot;dark energy&quot; when own all do not believe its rationality, but the present 
	scientist estimated, &quot;the dark energy&quot; possibly occupied the universe 
	ingredient 2/3, to its understanding regarding the understanding time, the 
	space, the matter and the energy had the key function (&quot;the Wilkinson 
	microwave different the telescope to analyze the universe microwave 
	radiation background to the detector&quot; and to determine the universe age and 
	the composition. This research confirmation, the universe has 4% is only the 
	ordinary day common ordinary matter, 23% is the cold dark matter which is 
	composed by the unclear granule, the remaining approximately 73% piece are 
the dark energy). </p>
	<p>In other words the modern science knew at 
	best only is in the universe 4%, this 4% beside modern scientists not clear 
	science also is any science, this is the people is pleased with oneself, 
	smug was scientific! Actually this stands with the Chinese tradition in in 
	north star's looked the question the worldview still was very different.
</p>
	<p>Chinese ancient times Chang E rushed the 
	month, if modern scientists on Moon's, certainly has not been thought the 
	feudalism blindly believed in deceived people thing, because they said do 
	not understand truth. American &quot;courage&quot; has gone to after Mars with the 
	&quot;opportunity&quot; Mars vehicle, on the Chinese the north star believed they did 
not dare to raise, otherwise the Chinese was the pioneer. </p>
	<p>This &quot;Science&quot; the magazine has also 
	selected other 9 scientific research breakthrough, item is: Proved the mouse 
	embryo stem cell may evolve the spermatozoon and the ova. About this 1., the 
	very long before Chinese medicine thought will be pregnant later also to be 
	possible to change the embryo sex the viewpoint, was considered will be 
	fantastic! Although in the animal kingdom action the deficiency, even the 
	grown-up animal may automatically change the sex as necessary, but the at 
	that time doctor practicing western medicine certainly is not so believed, 
	they only are one-sided wish thought the ova had decided in the 
	fertilization at that time the sex (this sufficiently explains doctor 
practicing western medicine or modern science modernized degree).</p>
	<p>Outside the Chinese martial arts so-called 
	&quot;great distance takes number of people&quot; before, is published in the modern 
	scientist's ultra-long-range missile or the nuclear weapon equally is 
	impervious. Every day looked the doctor practicing western medicine the 
	person understands the doctor practicing western medicine? Not also 
	illuminates eats the toxicant (western medicine is toxicant) according to is 
	butchered by the person not by mistake; Why looked the Chinese medicine had 
	to learn the Chinese medicine only then to look at the Chinese medicine? 
	Your excellency really thought the traditional Chinese doctor is all right 
may do? Greatly was wants to help but not be able to.</p>
	<p>Some people call self, did not understand or 
	not the clear matter, he certainly does not do, also does not believe. This 
itself only can explain this person waits for the enhancement. </p>
	<p>The modern doctor practicing western 
	medicine and the traditional Chinese medicine compares, regardless of from 
	the method, theoretically or in the curative effect all appears does not 
	suffice maturely. In fact the Chinese medicine has the profound foundation 
	and the vast market, although the present Chinese medicine is taught with 
	doctor practicing western medicine's pattern, as well as the Chinese 
medicine essence or the essence have lost 7788, be not much left.</p>

<p>In Chinese medicine status like this time, this

	<p>2003-05-23 first recognized the &quot;atypical 
	pneumonia the cause of disease for chlamydia the&quot; scientist, the China 
	prophylaxis control center virology chief researcher, Chinese project 
	courtyard academician the great waves said to reporter, in own life comes 
	across very many setbacks, takes the scientist, in the scientific research 
	the bitter experience majority is the defeat, very little meets 
	successfully. He extrapolated, he observes non- standard patient, after 
	because arises the immunity to drop, initiated clothes original to continue 
	sends the infection. At that time, through the electron microscope, has not 
	seen the coronal virus, but separated chlamydia. He acknowledged the 
	electron microscope the observation conclusion has the limitation, is 
	&quot;one-sided view&quot;. The media questioned that, the non- standard time, the 
	medical research achievement will affect the clinical practice, so grave as 
	to affect a human life, the risk will enlarge, whether the medical research 
	will allow &quot;to make a mistake&quot;? Is not willing to disclose the name medical 
	arena public figure tells reporter: <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">
	Scientist's official duty is engaged in the scientific research</span>, the 
	scientific research is moves towards the truth from the error the process, 
	but needs to be responsible for the public health decision-making. The 
	scientific research does not have the limit, today thought to, tomorrow will 
	possibly be wrong, will be supposed to the scientist more than 1 minute 
intolerance.</p>
	<p>
            Whether may understand like this: The 
			science in walks to truth in front of process itself is wrong, all 
			contemporary science all is mature by no means, or stems from the

  <p>
  What is worth mentioning, the Hong Kong some 
	doctors practicing western medicine learn the association president to state 
	that, &quot;may penetrate the injection prevention flu vaccine to prevent the 
	pneumonia, also may consider the injection prevention pneumonia chain coccus 
	the vaccine, the old person, resided in the buildings public figure in 
	particular and excises the spleen public figure to receive is injected... 
	... &quot;. Talks irresponsibly, all did not know the cause of disease, what is 
	the vaccine? Moreover the vaccine has greatly strengthened pointed, this may 
	also, that also be allowed, actually that to be allowed? Needs the dot duck 
	feathers or the white mouse wool liquor. Please note, this person for the 
	specialized academic society's officials, is both the science and 
	authority's public figure. </p>
  <p>The doctor practicing 
	western medicine in at present, as well as the obviously future, radically 
	will be unable to resist the virus! It in antibacteria after, during hundred 
	next year front has not still gone a step further, this also no wonder, they 
	do not have this intelligence. The viral variety, all is has no alternative, 
	only can be the promise: The new vaccine, the new medicine in steps up 
	during the research! The pitiful patient only can be crazily crazily waited 
	for (if still also in). </p>
  <p>Center the doctor practicing 
	western medicine to treats the disease the basic philosophy concept is 
	completely different: The doctor practicing western medicine is kills by 
	poison the nature, the antagonism, when the virus invades in patient's cell, 
	doctor practicing western medicine's treatment can simultaneously kill the 
	cell, namely so-called &quot;with belongs to completely&quot;.</p>
  <p>The Chinese medicine therapy 
	is the overall immunity, enhances the patient body the resistance, enables 
	it effectively to resist the virus, the resistance bacterium, resists the 
	AIDS, resists SARS.</p>
  <p>Some people thought the 
	Chinese medicine lacks the scientific nature, copes with the illness in 
	particular which like the SARS variety virus causes, but the Chinese 
	medicine came in the past several millenniums for the Chinese general 
	populace to treat the many kinds of illnesses, proved really had its 
	feasibility. But the doctor practicing western medicine is a matter which 
	several for hundred years only then has.</p>
  <p>
	&quot;Typhus Discussed&quot; for 1600-1700 year, but 
	until present, so long as side just right for the illness, was that 
	sickness, was allowed to be highly effective (does not have to pay attention 
	is any cancer, any AIDS, any SASA). Said since birth to the Chinese medicine 
	that, can grasp &quot;Typhus To discuss&quot; is a good doctor, but &quot;Typhus Discusses&quot; 
	said in the traditional Chinese medicine, only is a medium level discusses, 
	popularizes easily to study the popularity, also is said also has high 
	level. </p>
  <p>Although generally thinks 
	the Chinese native medicine property of a medicine not compared to the 
	western medicine strongly, need comparatively long treatment time, but the 
	Chinese native medicine can be able to take stopgap measures compared to the 
	western medicine effects a permanent cure, also causes the side effect less 
	(certainly we also may think Chinese native medicine toxicity is not 
	stronger than western medicine). We already in light of this the spot have 
	done appropriately (<a href="003a-English.html">this were we are arrogant 
	masterpiece to modern people's improvement for it which but feels too 
	ashamed to be in public</a>). </p>
  <p>Front the doctor practicing western medicine 
	greatly has been inferior to in recent years, has becomes worse and worse, 
	exhausts the bag of clumsy tricks, becomes the history, becomes certainly 
	sings the potential. The AIDS and the atypical pneumonia are at a loss the 
	doctor practicing western medicine, is frightened by the slightest sound is 
	a spot. The doctor practicing western medicine declined has happen to given 
	the good opportunity which the Chinese medicine rose, because the doctor 
	practicing western medicine prospect was gloomy, the doctor practicing 
	western medicine strength did not create in all sorts of disadvantageous 
	situations, the Chinese medicine will change in the healthy health care and 
	the sanitation system unique experience and the knowledge quite importantly. 
	We challenge the doctor practicing western medicine, not only must use the 
	theory to speak, speaks with the technology, but also must use the curative 
	effect to speak, speaks with the product as well as the market strength. In 
	fact, we (including doctor practicing western medicine itself also) again 
	are constructing the people to doctor practicing western medicine's view 
	west, perhaps one day, you have found the hospital, in the market appear 
	will be the Chinese medicine, but is not the doctor practicing western 
medicine.</p>
  <p>We inherit our traditional culture, has 
	nothing to do with with the doctor practicing western medicine / west science, 
	also does not need them to acknowledge or the approval, is far from the 
	question which any connects rails, because the basic elementary theory is 
	not same. We study and study our traditional culture, is for inherits and 
	carries forward our traditional culture well. The present Chinese medicine 
	study method, is doctor practicing western medicine's study method, with is 
	doctor practicing western medicine's teaching method, even thereupon doctor 
	practicing western medicine's thought method and processing method. The 
	Chinese medicine, by the doctor practicing western medicine was already 
	taught, has very for a long time learned the very many doctors practicing 
	western medicine's method! Passes an examination the Chinese medicine under 
	the doctor practicing western medicine test and the instruction which grows, 
	certainly is not the Chinese medicine, only is at best the doctor practicing 
	western medicine acknowledged / under the permission Chinese medicine, already 
	worships the foreigner, forgot own heritage despite study of it. We should 
	soberly and clearly knew that, should carefully the ponder and the 
	introspection, any be the Chinese medicine! Although jade of the Tashan may 
	attack the stone, but cannot imitate others slavishly and lose one's own 
	originality, cannot repeat ideas, the others said sells the antibiotic, we 
	also look for the bupleurum chinenses salvia miltiorrhiza to sell, the 
	others sold the Chinese native medicine to gain 300 hundred million US 
	dollars, we also had to make vigorous efforts to catch up. West the medical 
	chemical element and the active principle analysis western medicine, the 
	Chinese medicine also uses the chemical element and the active principle 
	gauge tube Chinese native medicine (gives the euphemistic name: 
	International approval standard)! As if somewhat puts the cart before the 
horse. </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: -19">Speaks Chinese 
	compared to to speak English, the use more cerebrums spot (the London road 
passes 2003-7-1 electricity)<ul>
      <li>The scientific researcher 
		yesterday said that, how an item does process the language to the 
		cerebrum to have recent discovery the research to point out, said 
		Chinese the person uses the cerebrum spot said English the person are 
  more than. </li>
      <li>English &quot;Wellcome Trust the&quot; 
		charitable research organization scientific researcher discovered that, 
		said English public figure only uses the cerebrum the one side to 
		understand English, but said Chinese public figure needs two to come in 
		the annotation Chinese using the cerebrum the different intonation. 
  </li>
      <li>
      This organization psychologist Si court said that, &quot;we very surprised 
		discovered said different language the public figure, comes take the 
		different method use cerebrum as the language to decode. Since this has 
		overthrown some theories which the people has been long-time believed. &quot;&nbsp; 
  </li>
      <li>Si court carries on the brain 
		scanning after the voluntary research thing to discover that, they use 
		the cerebrum the different spot annotation language and the intonation.&nbsp; 
  </li>
      <li>Said English the person when hears to 
		English, left side of his / her cerebrum temple can start actively, but 
		said Chinese public figure uses the cerebrum about two. The cerebrum 
		right leaf usually uses for to process in the music the melody and the 
		language. 
  </li>
      <li>In Chinese, the intonation is very important, 
		because it entrusts with the similar pronunciation different meaning. 
		For example similarly reads &quot;ma&quot;, but actually may express mother, 
		curses at people, the horse perhaps the hemp, this completely regards 
  the intonation to decide. </li>
      <li>Si court said in the statement that, &quot;we 
		thought said Chinese the public figure uses the cerebrum right leaf to 
		come the annotation intonation and the melody, entrusts with each 
  character correct meaning. &quot;</li>

  <p>
	Said instead dumps, this has sighing of the 
	equally good results from different methods with the Chinese medicine 
	situation, instead will dump in very long period of time will be a very hot 
	topic, the customs duty trade barrier reduction causes the national 
	independent control trade the method to be more and more few, therefore some 
	countries will start to use instead dump the lawsuit the method to protect 
	our country the economic. One kind of product normal customs duty very low, 
	but added on instead dumps the tax very to be high, this product will keep 
	off outside the entrance to a country. According to the international 
	finance newspaper reported that, at present take instead dumps the case to 
	become the hindrance international trade development as the manifestation 
	trade conflict the fundamental mode. Various countries on the one hand in 
	through advancement square deal development economy, on the other hand also 
	instead dumps in the use establishes the new trade barrier. Enters the world 
	according to China to pledge, China faced with 15 years non- market economy 
	country treatment, therefore the WTO member side authority is authorized to 
	denies the Chinese exportation enterprise economic system is operates under 
	the market economy system. China's enterprise and exports the product when 
	to face the import side member instead dumps the lawsuit actually is at one 
	kind of extremely unfair gentle disadvantageous position. Namely the Chinese 
	medicine and China's enterprise and exports the product with to be at one 
	kind of extremely unfair gentle disadvantageous position in fact in the 
present.</p>
	<p>
	The Chinese not spare a glances to the oneself 
	extremely valuable Chinese medicine, but devotes the doctor practicing 
	western medicine which initiates itself not yet to consummate, to be full of 
	loopholes, as well as justifies oneself with difficulty, and hopes to seek 
	an impossibility, hopes the doctor practicing western medicine to be allowed 
	to acknowledge, the sympathy or gives the small place to stick an awl, 
	looked the person complexion, lives under subjugation, depends on others, 
	and gives the euphemistic name of &quot;and the world connects rails&quot;, this 
	itself also is a joke. The Chinese medicine present status question, also is 
	to in fact people's hardship issue of concern, believed in the obviously 
	future, the proper authorities will be able to face up to and to solve this 
	question. Is certainly unfair because of the present hygienic management 
	overhead construction to the Chinese medicine, is certainly unfair to 
populace's health.</p>
	<p>
  Makes foreign things serve China, to make the 
	past serve the present, we will have to restore the Chinese medicine the 
	eternity fine reputation, the Chinese medicine are the Chinese medicine, 
	will not need doctor practicing western medicine's agreeing with the 
	approval. </p>
	<p>
  Now, represented the world medical service 
	advanced level already is doctor practicing western medicine's double spiral 
	CT machine or the nuclear magnetic resonance scanner, but had in 5000 the 
	history the Chinese medicine, <a href="001a01080301b01a.html">natural food

	medicine may bring the health for the humanity, brings happily for the 
	world! </p>
	<p>
  The doctor practicing western medicine is so 
	prosperous, with western person's habit related, a matter no matter cannot 
	understand, the western person can pat chest No Problem (not question); The 
	Oriental then humbly said may try. This is the East and West culture 
	difference and the distinction, also is the Chinese medicine at present one 
	of status reasons. Actually Oriental's breastbone and the western person's 
	breastbone all is same (minimum doctor practicing western medicine anatomy 
	textbook all is such writes), the western person can / dare to pat the chest, 
	the Oriental also can / dare to pat the chest.</p>

  <p>We chat the big cancer of the intestines 
	(colon cancer), this is a cancer which the modern people most often suffers 
	from. Initiates the big cancer of the intestines the factor is complex, 
	except the diet factor, the life style like does not eat little moves, 
	factor and so on spiritual pressure, environment quality, also can mutually 
	&quot;report on accomplishments&quot;, initiates the big cancer of the intestines. The 
	symptom including the excrement belt blood, the excrement changes the scrap, 
	the body weight drops, the constipation, the diarrhea and so on. The doctor 
	practicing western medicine believed, if has these symptoms, should let make 
	the colon mirror inspection as soon as possible. The question is this time 
	has been late! The discovery is sick when often already belonged to the last 
	stage stage (doctor practicing western medicine's procedure was lets the 
	people understand guarded against the cancer from voluntarily to examine 
	starts. You discover west, only then tells afterwards yours discovery 
doctor). </p>
	<p>So-called dives the blood, refers to the 
	blood which the naked eye sees. If the excrement dives the blood examination 
	result is masculine, estimated the trouble colon cancer the probability is 5 
	to 18%, but mostly belongs to the initial period. This time, the doctor 
	practicing western medicine can let the patient accept the colon mirror 
	inspection, learned causes the excrement to dive the blood cause of disease, 
	this possibly is the hemorrhoids (hemorrhoids), the colon inflammation, the 
polyp or the initial period cancer of the intestines. </p>
	<p>The excrement dives the blood masculine 
	gender, discovered the excrement belt blood, with the colon mirror 
	inspection masculine gender, is a very close same concept, already did not 
	have no initial period later period the distinction, all was same, several 
	days with were early late several days. The excrement dives the blood 
	masculine gender is the cancer of the intestines initial period, is only the 
	relative excrement belt blood, says with the colon mirror inspection 
	masculine gender. This time already has formed, the cancer already grew 
	into, already was the later period! Only is when fills in the cause of death 
	facilitates some, was allowed several god knows, not to send ahead of time 
	to the cause of death is unclear, dies had all not known was how dies, in an 
	extremely difficult situation. May send the patient family member, lets them 
be dumbfounded. </p>
	<p>The colon cancer patient may frequently 
	examine the excrement to dive the blood (although discovered when already 
	was later period), but other cancers how, how also examines? This only can 
	explain the doctor practicing western medicine is imperfect or the 
	unqualified medical way, the major part disease all none who does not so. 
Has the conscience colleagues, whether or not thought.</p>
	<p>Twenty eight years ago once taught us the 
	doctor practicing western medicine diagnostics a renowned internal medicine 
	department professor, was goes to the country went to the toilet when the 
	open country discovered the excrement belt blood, faints from fear has 
	suffered from contracts the cancer of the intestines, very quickly then left 
us to go. Such diagnostics waits for as if the discussion. </p>
	<p>Doctor practicing western medicine's every 
	this all sorts let we firmer suggestion patient change the Chinese medicine, 
	the use Chinese medicine, otherwise uses the doctor practicing western 
	medicine to like is playing a Russia roulette, he can do only has prayed 
this is an expiration bullet, is a dud.</p>
	<p>&quot;New York Times&quot; a technical column author 
	pogue writes in his column that, a woman seeks purchases 60 inches plasma 
	televisions (Plasma TV) the opinion to him, when he knew when in her 
	family's sofa and the television distance only has 8 feet, the good words 
	urges her the such near distance to 60 inches televisions opportunities 
	wound look, also is unable in the vision to achieve watches the big firefly 
	curtain movie effect. But this woman or persisted must buy, because she 
blindly believed in this is at present the most fashion product.</p>
	<p>The Federal Republic of Germany Munich 
	University's famous Chinese medicine expert Polk stating Chinese medicine is 
	&quot;alone standard science&quot;, he said the &quot;tradition the traditional Chinese 
	medicine most has the comprehensive nature, the continuity and the actual 
	effect, but until now, truly excavates the treatment potential actually is 
	only a small part, moreover is precisely because this kind excavates, causes 
	its scientific core and the essence has the danger which discards. The 
	reason lay in has confused the scientific standard and the scientific 
	method. Produces by the western medicine in only is suitable doctor 
	practicing western medicine's method reto appraise the traditional Chinese 
	medicine, this is unreasonable, inevitably causes the defeat, this kind 
	attempts equally to observe the star in the daytime, in non- moonlight dark 
	night observation dark cloud. The respect and the application traditional 
	Chinese medicine method confirmed and applies in this science the reasonable 
	material, certainly returns to the ancient times, but was the basic logic 
necessity needs. &quot;</p>
	<p>If must be splendid, we greatly it may be 
	said the Chinese medicine the standard is the universe standard, in fact Yi 
Li contains the cosmic inventory.</p>
  
	<p>
    Perhaps may say the doctor practicing western 
	medicine present the standard also can catch up with the Chinese medicine at 
	best 5000 ago the standard, namely doctor practicing western medicine after 
	technology and theory rise and fall to Chinese medicine 5000. The doctor 
	practicing western medicine plagiarizes the Chinese medicine the theory and 
the achievement everywhere obviously.</p>
  
	<p>In brief, cannot govern science itself which 
	got sick not to be unscientific, could treat an illness unscientific itself 
was a science.</p>
