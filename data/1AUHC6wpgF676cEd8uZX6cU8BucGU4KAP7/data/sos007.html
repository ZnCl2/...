<p>醉臥沙場君莫笑，古來征戰幾人回（唐•王翰《涼州詞》）。昔者夏鯀作三仞之城，諸侯背之，海外有狡心。禹知天下之叛也，乃壞城平池，散財物，焚甲兵，施之以德，海外賓服，四夷納職，合諸侯於塗山，執玉帛者萬國（《淮南子•原道訓》）。鑄劍習以為農器，放牛馬於原藪，室家無離曠之思，千歲無戰鬥之患（《孔子家語•致思》）。心身健康平和，即可化敵為友、化解仇恨和停止戰爭。籍此幫助各國、地區、民族和宗教相互尊重，和平共處。和平安定是每個國家的人民都喜聞樂見和懂得珍惜的。</p>
<p>和平通常指沒有戰爭或沒有其它敵視暴力行為的狀態，也用來形容人的不激動或安靜。和平運動目的在結束某一特定的戰爭（或是所有戰爭），或者是減少某一區域中（或所有情形下）人與人之間的暴力衝突，目的是世界和平。其內容一般包括和平主義、非暴力抵抗、外交、杯葛、良知消費、支持反戰的候選人、示威及遊說集團立法等。中醫介入是醫學和戰爭史上的全新概念和里程碑。這是<a href="001a12010301.html">中醫犯罪學</a>的研究範疇。</p>
<p>做為一個負責任及有能力的醫院，我們將負起國際責任，積極參與國際間的救援事務，尤其是戰爭與和平這千古恆長慘烈悲絕的問題。</p>

<p>Don’t laugh when they fall asleep drunk on the battlefield. How many soldiers ever come back from wars in history (Tang – Wang Han “Song of Liangzhou”). In ancient times, Xia Gun built a city with a wall of three Ren (eight metres) high for protection. All vassals betrayed him. Other tribes outside were eyeing the city too. Yu knew the rebellion in the world. He destroyed the wall, gave away all the treasures, and burned the weapons. He governed and educated people with morality. The whole world yielded to his governing. Everyone took up their responsibilities and did their jobs. When Yu held a meeting of vassals in Tu Mountain, there were thousands of tribe leaders coming to offer treasures as tributes. (Huai Nan Zi – Teaching of Yuan Dao). Beat swords into ploughshares. Unleash the war cattle into the wildness. Families no longer suffer from separation. For a long time there are no disasters brought by wars. (“Analects of Confucius – To Think”). Healthy and peaceful mind and body can turn enemies to friends, dissolve hatred and stop wars. It can help countries, regions, nations and religions to respect each other and live together in peace. Peace and stability are what people want to see and know to treasure in every country.</p>
<p>Peace usually means a status in which there are no wars or other hostile or violent actions. It is also used to describe the calmness and quietness of a person. The objective of the peace movement is to end a certain war (or all wars), or reduce the violent conflicts in a certain region (or under all circumstances). The goal is to achieve world peace. The content normally includes pacifism, non-violent resistance, diplomacy, boycotts, conscientious consumption, supporting anti-war candidates, demonstrations and lobbying group legislation, etc. Traditional Chinese Medicine intervention is a brand-new concept and milestone in medicine and war history. This is in the discipline of <a href="001a12010301eng.html">TCM criminology</a>.</p>
<p>As a responsible and capable hospital, we will take our international responsibilities and participate in the international rescue tasks proactively, especially when war and peace – a strategic and drastic question for thousands of years – are involved.</p>

  <li>12-03-16 Successfully maintained the stability in Jiangmen. The objects regained good mentality. The social conflicts and collisions were resolved subtly to effectively maintain social stability (every member of the stability maintenance centre was completely convinced). Up to today (24 July 2014) the 121 military veterans are still calm and peaceful. They also participate in public services in nursing homes, etc., during their spare time, bringing a new image and positive energy to the society. A very bigoted Sanxia emigrate listened to the music only once and stayed out of trouble till now, smiling and greeting leaders (this is also the joy of our success).</li>
