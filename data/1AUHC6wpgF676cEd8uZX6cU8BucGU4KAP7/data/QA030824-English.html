      <ul>
        <li>The cooperation of Chinese and Western 
		medicine treatment most headache topic is: The China and the West 
		medicine metabolism mutually affects; </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Needs to innovate in in the medicine 
			research methodology, but obstructs to the modern science and 
			technology method level, must truly understand between the China and 
			the West medicine the relations still had long Lu Yaotsou; </li>
          <li>China and the West medicine Lian Yong 
			clinical research difficulty very big, covers the western medicine 
			clearly the ingredient, the target spot is clear about, but Chinese 
			native medicine then the ingredient is complex, target, how played 
			in the human body the role until now is still a riddle, therefore 
			had to want the idea, the tool, the method to coordinate to be able 
			to explain clearly, but at present still has not met the above 
			requirement; </li>
        </ul>
        <li>The China and the West medicine in the 
		treatment method, the idea and the method is not certainly same; </li>
        <ul>
          <li>At present two medicine distances 
			extremely are remote, do not have commonly any place, just like 
			scales the heights of is same, the China and the West medicine 
			respectively sets out from the north and south two peaks; </li>
          <li>But we believed two medicine 
			throughout can more and more approach, the different way but with 
			turns over to! The question is who assimilates who;</li>
          <li>We also believed, after ten years, 
			only some one medicine existence, approves for the common people and 
			accepts, because the reality is a reality after all; </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Because two medicine systems have 
		fundamentally to person's understanding are different, therefore 
		international certainly does not approve the traditional Chinese 
		medicine the clinical result (actually is doctor practicing western 
		medicine certainly does not approve Chinese medicine), likes Chinese the 
		popular degree and English is differently same, itself certainly did not 
		explain any (must blame speech, only can blame us ancestor not to have 
		territorial expansion ambition);</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The doctor practicing western 
			medicine study is knows the disease from the shape and the 
			structure, thought the human body the shape, the structure have 99% 
			is same; </li>
            <ul>
            <li>The identical disease each other 
			shape change is same, the disease has the community pathological 
			change, therefore appears the homogeneity the pathological change 
			crowd, therefore has the stochastic comparison in the clinical 
			research the request; </li>
            <li>If not the impossible all people 
			all to do the research, appears sampling the means; </li>
            <li>In order to strengthen the 
			representation, also joins the stochastic form, makes every effort 
			to conform with the scientific principle;</li>
            <li>When a sample is insufficient to to 
			explain when question, must have the comparison, the comparison 
			project, guarantees between the sample and the sample has the 
			commeasurability, namely follows the card medicine then heavy 
			design, survey and appraisal concept; </li>
          </ul>
          <li>The traditional Chinese medicine and 
			doctor practicing western medicine's study idea has the basic 
			difference, the Chinese medicine from the shape, the structure does 
			not know the human body, therefore does not have the series nature 
			community the view; </li>
            <ul>
            <li>The Chinese medicine thought 
			person's shape, the structure are live, is stimulated inside and 
			outside environment appears the response;</li>
            <li>Although the shape structure is 
			same, but each person's internal organs function respectively 
			different, after is stimulated can appear the different response, 
			its mood, the psychology and the point of view are certainly 
			dissimilar, this is the unusual individuality, the individual, does 
			not have to doctor practicing western medicine's homogeneity 
			community idea; </li>
            <ul>
              <li>The doctor practicing western 
				medicine is studies the human body structural change the rule;
				</li>
              <li>The Chinese medicine is the 
				research attaches to the human body shape structure, the human 
				body function change rule, this is the traditional Chinese 
				medicine clinical research cuts into the spot;</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>The individuality treatment may enhance 
		the curative effect; </li>
        <ul>
          <li>The individuality diagnosis and the 
			treatment are a goal which the doctor practicing western medicine 
			study recent years pursued, because only had like this only then may 
			further enhance the curative effect; </li>
            <ul>
            <li>The world health expert believed 
			that, the individuality treatment is a 21st century clinical 
			medicines development direction; </li>
            <li>But traditional Chinese medicine 
			this set of method already durable quite several millenniums; </li>
          </ul>
          <li>The doctor practicing western 
			medicine study saw the symptom of a trend to the individual 
			treatment, gradually moves towards the individual from the 
			community; </li>
            <ul>
            <li>But, its rationale throughout 
			regards as the person the community, makes it in at this time today 
			to walk into the difficult position;</li>
            <li>May anticipate, the doctor 
			practicing western medicine study next step of goal is the person 
			looked is a dynamic whole studies, although is nearly not impossible 
			(because has copper fetid odor). </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>In other words, the 
		China and the West medicine now certainly does not have the union the 
		common language or the possibility, also meant calculated with the 
		administrative order, at best only altogether uses an office, in the 
		identical office each does what he thinks is right, or with drinks pot 
		coffee. </p>
		<p>
		The doctor practicing western medicine 
		kills by poison the principle, with the Chinese medicine adjustment 
		principle is different. With doctor practicing western medicine's lethal 
		dose computation Chinese medicine hundred flowers snake tongue grass, 
		only has the Chinese medicine which the doctor practicing western 
		medicine educates only then to be able so to process! Screening treats 
		the cancer the Chinese native medicine, seeks has the anti- cancer the 
		Chinese native medicine, also only has the Chinese medicine which was 
		taught the doctor practicing western medicine only then to say. Such 
		being the case science doctor practicing western medicine, also why 
		helpless bug what? But non- standard classics? </p>
      <p>The traditional Chinese 
		medicine although has the advanced theory, but has restricted the 
		development step because of certain reasons backwardness. The atypical 
		pneumonia epidemic situation improved the Chinese medicine status, we 
		should grasp this opportunity development traditional Chinese medicine 
		system, weeds through the old to bring forth the new in the clinical 
		research, to obtain a better effect, benefits the patient. </p>
      <p>We should not spend the 
		time and the manpower physical resource establish the digital Chinese 
		medicine and the technical system in the clinical research. By the 
		digital literature concept knew and the explanation is doctor practicing 
		western medicine's study research way, certainly is not suitable in the 
		traditional Chinese medicine, simultaneously can more trace black, 
		because populace's understanding ability is limited, only if you will 
		have the original story the so abstruse traditional Chinese medicine 
		theory three languages two words explanations to be clear. Let alone the 
		populace did not understand that, the doctor practicing western medicine 
		did not understand, the Chinese medicine jobholders also many was the 
		heart has hit, referred difficultly bright, was not certainly easy to 
		understand and to achieve mastery through a comprehensive study of a 
		subject. In order to enhance strong points and avoid weaknesses, exempts 
		the spring white clouds, we should to the curative effect speak, makes 
		known to the public by the outstanding treatment result, take the high 
		speed highly effective any side effect as the characteristic, lets the 
		people understand and accept has in 5000 the history the outstanding 
		medicine. </p>
      <p>Doesn't have doctor practicing western 
		medicine's age, how the Chinese medicine is passes through? The Chinese 
		medicine tradition is the medicine parents heart, heart of take the 
		parents, regards the patient to leave as the oneself, is responsible for 
		it, will cure with the harmless method, thorough curing, will not be 
		able again to manifest suddenly curing! How could heard resembles like 
		the present, is one kind of commercial relation, doctor tries the big 
		prescription high sales commission, the patient tries to question each 
		doctor (hope looks for doctor which as soon as trusts and has help), the 
		patient and doctor are one kind of resistance or the resistance 
		psychology, how doesn't this affect the treatment? </p>
		<p>
		The doctor practicing western medicine to 
		fast caters to the common people critically ill psychology, considers 
		only the at present point of view, has excised the tumor, certainly has 
		been attractive, the question is the cause of disease has not 
		eliminated, next time also will be able again to send! But the next time 
		already will be the next time matter, Qian Ishou, the business already 
		makes in any case, next time sooner. Therefore said this although is the 
		business which succeeds, but to the patient is the irresponsible way. We 
		also understood this certainly is not doctor practicing western 
		medicine's original intention, what a pity is this is the helpless fact. 
		Doctor practicing western medicine itself also deeply feels confusedly, 
		receives the education and grasps the knowledge and the reality do not 
		tally, they also are seeking the outlet. </p>
      <p>
		The doctor practicing western medicine 
		certainly is not a complete system.</p>
		<p>The Chinese medicine has the Chinese 
		medicine system or the system, from became a body (minimum 300 year 
		before continuously so), moreover was extremely outstanding, why also 
		had to confuse one for the other, outsmarts oneself?</p>
		<p>
The Chinese medicine is uses the universe energy, 
the Chinese medicine prescription is the universe can one of application 
methods, is the universe can the concrete use, the universe can the use, 
certainly not ignorant killing by poison may place on a par with the simple 
excision. </p>
      <p>Long term says, still should by the 
		traditional Chinese medicine development traditional Chinese medicine, 
		push as soon as possible the traditional Chinese medicine to the 
		renewal, a higher level, namely modernized level, with when advanced 
		together. </p>
            
		<p>The Chinese medicine has the spirit, 
		gives up the doctor practicing western medicine which you now uses 
		diagnose the Chinese medicine knowledge which the method and the doctor 
		practicing western medicine teaches, earnestly grasps the Chinese 
		medicine four to examine with the corresponding unadorned Chinese 
		medicine foundation, do not study others any anti- cancer anti- virus, 
		must know, the Chinese medicine is despises to these. </p>
<p>
When the Chinese medicine goal with works as the 
doctor practicing western medicine is different, cannot the same date say. Is is 
an idea, is for the camp business, the doctor practicing western medicine is or 
may be the business dealing, but the business dealing to the Chinese medicine 
said is despises, makes money is not the Chinese medicine goal, may not be 
concerned only about profit, the Chinese medicine was the medicine parents 
heart, &quot;in big medical concise&quot; has been clear about the instruction. </p>
            
		<p>The cooperation of Chinese and Western 
		medicine only advantage, possibly is may alleviate the doctor practicing 
		western medicine the awkwardness which has no alternative facing the 
		disease.</p>
            
		<p>
		Some people the Hong Kong non- standard 
		period more than 1,700 people will catch an illness, 299 people die of 
		illness, destroy several hundred families happiness to put the blame on 
		to know limitedly to this kind of neopathy sickness. But in fact, if the 
		Hong Kong government and the medical department initially looks down 
		upon the Chinese medicine, if the doctor practicing western medicine can 
		suffice promptly to take the suitable guard measure (certainly, if has), 
		Hong Kong catches an illness and the casualty is may greatly reduce. The 
		entire port hospital appears the responsibility in any event to Hong 
		Kong because of the non- standard which the such serious human life 
		casualties has cannot be shirked, cans hardly absolve.</p>
		<p>
		(Why under the public sentiment turbulent 
		popular indignation and the formidable social pressure on nobody thought 
		investigated doctor practicing western medicine's responsibility), the 
		hygienic welfare and food commodity bureau Bureau Chief Yang x x 
		successively low-spirited leaves office with medical department 
		President Liang, says really, they are very treat unjustly with the 
		grievance, if these doctors practicing western medicine some original 
		stories, all have not put to death the people, they cannot die, they 
		cannot leave office, could not become the doctor practicing western 
		medicine for the crime lamb. The people most want to see not only are 
		the concerned official take the blame and resign, hoped consummates the 
		entire medical system. </p>
		<p>
		The paper wraps up the fire, the doctor 
		practicing western medicine already revealed one's true colors in front 
		of the non- standard, although still does not send Yu Wei and its the 
		present status, but made doctor practicing western medicine's future 
		great danger. The deeply grieved fact, constrains the anger, many years 
		hate, always some on first bursts out anger the thunder, shakes breaks 
		down the foundation which the doctor practicing western medicine pains 
		builds. The doctor practicing western medicine from thinks the 
		self-satisfied extremely high new science and technology, also is 
		mediocre, the Lian Hsiaohsiao non- standard also could not process, how.
		</p>
		<p>Chinese medicine and doctor practicing 
		western medicine although all are is a medicine, but the two entirely 
		different (trouble was the present Chinese medicine also in study doctor 
		practicing western medicine), the two concept was completely different. 
		Is a vegetarian on the picture and eats meat, with whether or not the 
		nutrition is two matters, is two completely different concepts. </p>
		<p>The Chinese medicine and the doctor 
		practicing western medicine not only are the academic struggle, moreover 
		is with the world common people long correlation struggle life and 
		death, involves the life to spread the coal, does not have any polite 
		erudite Confucian scholar, gently obeys. Because cures the disease to be 
		equal to dies, is equal to the death! Likes the non- standard the ghost 
		to be same, or like AIDS ghost! </p>
		<p>We do not discuss the cancer, said the 
		diabetes has been good, many dimorphism diabetes patient is after arises 
		for several years only then to discover the condition! By now the kidney 
		possibly already started to damage, the doctor practicing western 
		medicine only could depend upon albuminuria the inspection to discover 
		whether the patient kidney already did have the problem, also only could 
		act appropriately to the situation, slows down the aggravation of 
		disease, also only could passively filter to kidney fading with the 
		machinery, simultaneously knew this was firmly not the return avenue, 
		only was tows the time, one day compared to day heavy, one day really to 
		one day! Surpasses four tenths diabetes patients to be able to suffer 
		from the renopathy, finally only can depend on the kidney to transplant 
		or washes the kidney to maintain the life for a long time. Needs to wash 
		the kidney in the diabetes patient, only some 1/4 may exactly surpass 
		for 5 years, many also can suffer from the heart disease, the stroke, 
		loses one's sight and so on the illness complication. Such work fully 
		suffices? To results in the patient? Not only so, but also tells the 
		patient this is the only method of treatment! </p>
		<p>The doctor practicing western medicine 
		must calculate the lethal dose, calculates a kilogram / body weight; 
		Chinese medicine then concept different, is only with the switch 
		principle, non-toxic is harmless, the Chinese medicine treatment, is 
		natural being restored to health, is encouragement natural being 
		restored to health, promotes natural being restored to health. </p>
		<p>Since we understood and sees the doctor 
		practicing western medicine replete with errors, why doesn't let the 
		common people know? Why doesn't let the common people accept well, even 
		more may save their life the Chinese medicine? A doctor, has the 
		conscience doctor if knew own localization / standpoint, should consider 
		for the patient, considers for patient's benefit, considers for 
		patient's life. </p>
		<p>West doctor itself has received 
		misleading, was not west doctor's mistake, was the doctor practicing 
		western medicine has deceived the populace, was the doctor practicing 
		western medicine system has deceived the populace! Will be the doctor 
		practicing western medicine not the mature thing uses on the sickness 
		person, west hoped doctor will be allowed to awaken, will not deceive 
		oneself and others. Simply thinks that, why such many incurable 
		diseases, simultaneously so-called may treat, but is delays surviving, 
		has not removen the cause of disease, but the doctor practicing western 
		medicine never mentions removes the cause of disease, does not propose 
		the prevention.</p>
		<p>When the doctor practicing western 
		medicine could not process, the doctor practicing western medicine gave 
		up, the patients could not mind the Chinese medicine whether feudalism 
		had blindly believed in, they could look for the Chinese medicine. So 
		long as they accept / take the Chinese native medicine, they can profit.
		</p>
		<p>The sesame seed mung bean soup may treat 
		an illness, what concept is this? Looks like the atomic bomb and the TNT 
		blasting explosive concept, TNT needs a truck only then to be allowed to 
		explode a small hole, the atomic bomb is not a hole question, but was a 
		city question. We do not have to follow doctor practicing western 
		medicine's theory, because of its theory replete with errors, 
		simultaneously also is the ratio which said completes. The peanut 
		fries / boils, after eats the bodily response is different, the southerner 
		are many is not familiar with eats fries the peanut, because can get 
		angry. Some women, the physique compares the weak one common dizzy, the 
		clothing fries the black soybeans then, simple is effective, solid, 
		simply does not need any to guard against the dizzy medicine.</p>
		<p>The Chinese medicine has the Chinese 
		medicine the theory, the slow doctor of Chinese medicine's name or the 
		concept must changes, any Chinese medicine only can treat the chronic 
		illness, is wrong! The Chinese medicine has anxiously governs its sign, 
		slow governs its theory / stipulation, also is said also may use in to 
		administer first aid. The traditional culture pursue connotation, is not 
		the form external, semblance surface. If hits the Taijiquan, may stand 
		is hitting, may sit hits, also may lie down is hitting, may hit under 
		the static state, the law is indefinite method is this Italy.</p>
