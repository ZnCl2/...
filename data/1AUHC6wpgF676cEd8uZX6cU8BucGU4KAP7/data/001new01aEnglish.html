<p>The utmost important points need your attention 
are: Validity date, Time to take soup (dosage), Temperature of the soup, and 
prepare the Tang Fang precisely.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Prepare the Tang Fang (prescription) precisely</b>; 
	each printed copy of Tang Fang is for 3 days, one dosage per person per day. 
	That is to prepare 3 similar sets of ingredients according to each Tang 
  Fang.<ul>
		<li>One set of ingredients (one dosage) is for one day/person used. You can 
		prepare one set of ingredients daily or three sets all at once;<ul>
			<li>All ingredients and respective quantities prescribed on each Tang 
			Fang is a complete set i.e. one set for one day/person;</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>There is no special requirement on ingredient unless otherwise specify, 
		as long as it is the ingredient as named, reason being the substance of 
		the ingredient always remain no matter its form (e.g. toast ground nut, 
		fried ground nut, baked ground nut, salted ground nut, sugared ground 
		nut, or even ashes of ground nut is still ground nut), still named as 
		ground nut, its substance never changed, its field never change. The 
		quantity of ingredient must be accurate; any miscount will loose the 
		curing effect;<ul>
			<li>E.g. Chinese red dates, regardless of its place of origin, 
			regardless of its size, ripe or unripe, dried or fresh, regardless 
			of its shape, as long as it is Chinese red dates then it can be 
			used;</li>
			<li>E.g. &nbsp;Chrysanthemum, if does not specify color, any color can be 
			used; if does not specify place of origin, any place of origin can 
			be used; that means you buy from Chinese herb&#8217;s shop or florist, or 
			pluck from your garden all can be used;</li>
			<li>Ingredient in nuciform like gingko and walnut, must remove the 
			shell/crust to ease decocting;</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Moderate (when no specific quantity is given) : means any quantity you 
		deem fit. E.g. a single granule of sugar/salt or a small quantity are 
		acceptable;<ul>
			<li>Slice (in square centimeter) : the area of a slice is measured in 
			square centimeter, e.g. 1cm<sup>2 </sup>= 1 slice (length x width = 
			1cm<sup>2</sup>);<ul>
				<li>Please use the measurement unit if stated, otherwise follow 
				common practice, e.g. 1 slice of tea leaf means the area size of 
				the slice can be any measurement. If the measurement unit is 
				stated e.g. 1 slice of laver (square centimeter), you can cut 1 
				slice with the area size of 1cm<sup>2</sup> from a large piece 
				of laver;</li>
				<li>1 slice means 1 slice, few slices not equal to 1 slice even the 
				combination of the total area size is 1cm<sup>2</sup>;</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Cube (in cubic centimeter) : the volume of a cube is measured in 
			cubic centimeter, e.g. 1cm<sup>3</sup> = 1 cube (length x width x 
			height = 1cm<sup>3</sup>);</li>
			<li>Teaspoon is referring to the spoon for stirring sugar while drinking 
			tea. Soup spoon is referring to the spoon use for serving soup;</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>If a few family members using prescription simultaneously : Each family 
		member must print a copy of the Tang Fang, prepare the ingredients 
		separately and decocting the soup separately (dispense according to the 
		Tang Fang one by one i.e. Cannot dispense base on 1 Tang Fang for more 
		than 1 person);<ul>
			<li>The order of dispensing should start from elderly to youngest e.g. 
			Grandfather/grandmother, father/mother, elder brother/sister, 
			younger brother/sister (Strictly no writing is allowed on both sides 
			of the Tang Fang);</li>
			<li>Use 3 cups while dispensing ingredients for each Tang Fang (cup is 
			good as small size ingredient like sesame will not stick on it), can 
			use marker pen to write on the cup e.g. A1, A2, A3 (grandfather), 
			B1,B2,B3 (grandmother), C1,C2,C3 (father), D1,D2,D3(mother), 
			E1,E2,E3 (elder brother), F1,F2,F3 (elder sister-in-law), G1,G2,G3 
			(younger brother)......</li>
			<li>A1,A2,A3 are for grandfather to use on day 1, day 2, and day 3; 
			B1,B2,B3 are for grandmother to use on day 1, day 2, and day 3, and 
			so forth......</li>
			<li>Strictly not allow to multiply the quantity of ingredients nor 
			combine ingredients from a few Tang Fang to decoct the soup or drink 
			the same soup by more than one person;</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><b>Decoct 1 dosage per day</b>, 
		fill with water at least 3 inches above ingredients<ul>
		<li>Decocting utensil and method;<ul>
		<li>Use Traditional Chinese Herbs Decocting Pot (made in clay), feature of 
		the pot is top (mouth) and bottom (base) diameter are smaller then the 
		middle part of the pot, having a spout and cover;<ul>
		<li>Patient with serious illness is recommended to decoct the soup daily 
		i.e. once a day; if possible use charcoal; can take the soup 3 times a 
		day (must adhere to the given time schedule);</li>
		<li>Those with limited time (busy) can pre-decoct the soup and store it in 
		the refrigerator; must decoct the soup separately either use the same 
		pot and decoct 3 times or use 3 different pots to decoct simultaneously 
		( Not allowed to use 1 pot to decoct more than 1 dosage i.e. 1 complete 
		set of ingredients );</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>More than 1 person taking Tang Fang : use a few porcelain cups with 
		cover (can use porcelain plate as cover), 3 cups&nbsp; in a group (can use 
		porcelain bowl if no cup available), decoct by putting into pressure 
		cooker, microwave oven, or steamer to steam the soup (in this case, 
		water just need to be above ingredients because water will not be 
		evaporated in the steaming process);</li>
		<li>When travel : can use portable cooker, hotplate, or electrical oven;<ul>
		<li>When decocting is not possible, can use boiling hot water to prepare the 
		soup;</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>All ingredients stated on Tang Fang must put into the decocting pot 
		simultaneously (in any sequencing order unless specify);</li>
		<li>No need to soak ingredients, and no need to wash ingredients unless very 
		dirty like sand or mud;</li>
		<li>If ingredients including wine or alcohol, all alcohol will be evaporated 
		in the decocting process, as such those abstain from alcohol still can 
		take the soup without worry;</li>
		<li>It is alright to reheat soup stored in the refrigerator, medication 
		potency will not be affected;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Initially use strong fire to decoct then turn to use slow fire after 
	boiling,</b> 
	decoct the soup till 1/3 of a rice bowl<ul>
		<li>Initially use strong fire to decoct, after boiling, turn to use slow 
		fire to decoct (just bubbling) the soup just enough to fill 1/3 of a 
		rice bowl. No need to re-decoct the soup;</li>
		<li>Avoid to open the cover while decocting; If ingredients burned/scorched, 
		must throw away the soup and ingredients because the medication effect 
		has been changed;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Taking the soup twice a day</b>, 
	no need to eat dregs (ingredients left over after decocting)<ul>
		<li>Take the soup (medication) twice a day by splitting into two portions; 
		Not recommended to eat dregs due to beans are not easily digestible;</li>
		<li>Do not drink tea 30 minutes before and after taking the soup (may drink 
		warm water), avoid cold food and cold drink 30 minutes after taking the 
		soup;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><b>Take the soup punctually</b>, 
	according to stated time schedule and temperature of the soup<ul>
		<li>Taking time: Choose any two from the three stated time schedule. Each 
		schedule span over two hours, must take the soup within the schedule 
		(two hours), not allow to take the soup at any other time !<ul>
		<li>Time is referring to local time (where you are located), this is to 
		      harmonize with Qi and blood circulation of human body;
		    <ul>
		      <li>Strictly adhere to stated time schedule to take soup irregardless 
		            after meal or before meal, irregardless of gap in between taking 
		            soup (medication); night time can use alarm clock or vibration 
		            function of mobilephone;              
	          </li>
	        </ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Best timing : the first 3 minutes of each time schedule will bring the 
		best medication effect, especially good for people suffer serious 
		illness;<ul>
		<li>E.g. 23:00-01:00, the best time is 23:00-23:03, the medication effect is 
		30% higher than later time; Not allow to take the soup earlier e.g. 
		22:59 because this time is outside of the two hour span of 23:00-01:00;</li>
		<li>The reason we provide a two hours span of each time schedule is for 
		those who need to work or school able to take the soup at their 
		convenient within this time; Although the best effect is within the 
		first 3 minutes, the effectiveness in the remaining time can surprise 
		you too;</li>
	</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Temperature of the soup : adhere to Tang Fang;<ul>
			<li>Cold or Mild : Best with cold, mild is fine too (can take the soup right 
		after taking out from refrigerator );</li>
			<li>Mild : room temperature (25<sup>0</sup>C);</li>
			<li>Hot or Mild : Best with hot, mild is fine too (hot but at drinkable 
		temperature, can use microwave oven or hot water to heat up the soup);</li>
		</ul>
		<li>In the situation of not able to eat/drink, may use chopstick or cotton 
		bud to drop a single drop of the soup on the tongue of the patient, this 
		can apply to unconscious patient too;</li>
		<li>When out of home or travel : can bring soup in a container, some 
		container able to keep warm/cold, can keep the soup in refrigerator in 
		hot weather; feeding bottle is good alternative since it is hygiene and 
		can be reheated easily;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
		<li><b>Medication Potency/Effectiveness Multiplier</b> 
		: following are multipliers of the soup medication 
		potency/effectiveness, it is like turbocharger, it is the uniqueness of 
		TCM, and the most valuable and distinguishing feature of Chinese culture 
		:<ul>
			<li>When prepare the ingredients must be engross and meticulous, this 
			will strengthen the medication effect/potency:<ul>
				<li>We hope that the preparation, decocting, and the entire process 
				are completed by oneself or next of kin; Never prepare, decoct, 
				or taking the soup with a playful mindset; Others are not allow 
				to try or taste the soup;</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Decocting by son/daughter/next of kin will boost and strengthen the 
			medication potency/effectiveness another 50% !<ul>
				<li>Medication + love + filial piety, can have better and faster 
				curing effect; there is an old saying, decoct by different 
				people can make the difference in effectiveness;</li>
				<li>Try not to pass the process to worker or maid, unless there is 
				no other alternative; Also please remember to treat others well;</li>
				<li>Loyal, filial, benevolence, righteousness, trust, etiquette, 
				wisdom, and brave, among these behaviors loyal and filial are 
				the most important; we&#8217;ll use this as the standard to select the 
				distribution center and whom to decoct the soup, respect and 
				enjoy one&#8217;s career is very important, filial piety is utmost 
				important, without it nothing can be done and may not have good 
				effect, TCM take this seriously and so do other industries, 
				including breeding and agriculture ( flower will not blossom 
				beautifully without kindhearted planter) ;</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Perform good virtue : do not avoid from perform it because it is 
			just a trivial virtue, do not perform it because it is just a 
			trivial vice; God bless who think and act good;<li>Kindhearted patient will have better curing effect, this is an 
			important part of Chinese culture; If there is something you do not 
			want others to know about, the only way is not to do it in the first 
			place; what you sow is what you reap; great joy comes from helping 
			others;</ul>
		</li>
	<li>Discard used prescription or unused prescription that has exceeded the expiry date immediately; Discard the prescription by tearing it into pieces and throwing into trash can (to prevent others contact the discarded paper) or burn the prescription (beware of fire);;</li>
	<li>Under emergency situation where no time to decoct soup, just leave the 
	printed prescription under the pillow or close to body.</li>
</ol>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -19px">Note :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Reaction (including all kinds of reaction like dizziness, pain, muscle 
	vibration, hot, cold, etc ) after using the prescription means the curing is 
	taking place. Other points require attention please refer to
	<a href="001new01-English.html">Information Need-To-Know</a>, and please refer to
	<a href="QA-English.html">FAQ</a> for further information;</li>
<li>No side effect to human body, suitable to take the soup for long period ( 
	will strengthen the body after recovering from diseases, thereafter may 
	prolong human life span);</li>
<li>Period of treatment depends on seriousness of diseases, age, habitude, 
	constitution, surrounding environment that vary from person to person.</li>
