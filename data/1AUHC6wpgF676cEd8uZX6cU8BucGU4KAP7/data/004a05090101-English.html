<p>The Chinese medicine beauty gathers one, solves the human 
disease worry only method. Between universe never exhaustible the energy, with 
the landscape coexistence, the world with is long-lived, the livelihood same 
splendor, for ever and ever, the millennium by comes always is humanity's 
yearning for with the expectation. Therefore, we put up this place to lead to 
the health the bridge. </p>
<ul>
	<li>This is in the world the first on-line 
	hospital: During first is worthy of the name the hypothesized hospital, has 
	the entity hospital the complete function (prevention disease and treats 
	disease), and goes beyond, takes the lead with in advance the time, is the 
	high intellectual property rights high state-of-art science and technology 
	(computer network only is cooperates from, traditional Chinese medicine is 
	high tech)! Provides most ancient and the also most advanced Chinese 
	medicine medical service service through the Internet to the world, is 
	modern and the traditional perfect union standard. No matter in world any 
	quoin, is confined at home all may accept the treatment, all may feel the 
	horizon if neighbor Chinese medicine in advance formidable science and 
	technology strength, here and healthy zero distance; </li>
	<li>Use next generation medical service technology 
	entire automated hospital: The automatic diagnosis, the automatic treatment, 
	automatic suitably matches, the automatic protection human body, the 
	automatic adjustment is healthy, the self-balancing optimizes, needs any 
	artificial senate with with any artificial diagnosis, avoids subjective 
	absurd replete with errors misdiagnosing the waiting which certainly looks 
	with hardship with the endless endless night, may effectively prevent and 
	control any disease, truly achieves the foresightedness prevention and the 
	treatment, will prevent disease, treats an illness, the maintenance health 
	and prolongs the life the technical union to the sole entire suitable 
	solution. This technical concept is similar to sun's principle, so long as 
	has the sun, is willing to expose to the sun the sun the people all may 
	bathe under the sunlight; Or likes the bus not to have to survey the height 
	body weight, also does not have to pay attention to the male and female old 
	and young, so long as is willing to board all may let them achieve the goal;</li>
	<li>World biggest hospital: This the hospital may 
	simultaneously hold with the gang helps 64 hundred million people! This the 
	hospital use tradition Chinese medicine, the use classical Chinese medicine, 
	uses the orthodox school standard the Chinese medicine, but is not Western 
	doctor professor's Chinese medicine, is not the western-style Chinese 
	medicine, is not with the stethoscope sphygmomanometer Chinese medicine. So 
	long as accesses the net, each people all may in the hospital obtain the 
	first-class Chinese medicine treatment and the best curative effect in this 
	(And lacks deficiency medicine including remote border district to live and 
	to lack deficiency medicine countryside);</li>
	<li>World first doctor's fee along with the 
	hospital which presents: To the poor person said is a free hospital! Own 
	grasp pays expenses the standard, voluntarily pays according to own wish, 
	any expense worrying, nobody has not forced also nobody to receive after 
	dunning. Diagnoses and treats the expenditure in own grasping with the 
	budget within, facilitates quickly and safe is effective. In the present 
	looked a cold all can open $300~$400 medicines ages, specially the 
	countryside and does not have the medical insurance, does not have the 
	pension, does not have the unit to reimburse, if any sickness, everybody 
	does not dare to guarantee may pay complete expense the age, no matter that 
	continent that country, certainly also includes (matter which US common 
	American most worried is falls ill, lightly goes bankrupt heavily is with 
	one's family broken up and decimated), therefore, this hospital value and 
	the Chinese medicine future prospect will be self-evident. This is the true 
	prevention, the real treatment and the sincere help;</li>
	<li>May prevent and treat any 
	known and the unknown disease (treats different diseases with the same 
	method): The traditional Chinese medicine science and technology, the 
	ancient Chinese medicine, does not need observation, the old person young 
	children all are suitable, are suitable for any person. </li>
</ul>
<p>Security 
prescription is easy, effect Fang Nanch'iu! The patient goal is treats an 
illness, diagnoses is not a goal, to the patient said diagnoses the liver cancer 
lung cancer not to have any significance (although has economic value to the 
Western medicine), because this all is Zhuge Liang after the fact, 
simultaneously was yesterday Chrysanthemum! The correct method is prevents ahead 
of time and treats ahead of time, but was not when casts greatly wrong is 
already late only then now's your chance! The human life to is heavy, 
expensively to the daughter, a side aids it, Germany passes to this. Therefore 
we provide this service, will study carry out abundantly aids, natural food, 
natural health. May access the net the computer on 
as 
a hospital, solved the Chinese medicine to be difficult to study and the popular 
question. We lead the on-line hospital the common common people family, although 
is not the broken day uncultivated land, but also is earth-shaking, because this 
act at the same time can initiate a medicine revolution,Also let us remember 
Gorky "Song of the Petrel", in 
order to trillion is innocent with but by disease and doctor practicing western 
medicine, Dual suffering pitiful patient - -Let 
the storm wind and rain&#12288;comes 
more violent! </p>
<p>Sees a doctor, is 
relaxed! Governs cures, is simple! Because is correct for the life itself very 
simple -- like fruit method between, but breathes, world person and then.</p>
<p>The on-line hospital processes the patient to 
count the goal limit is the series printing machine speed and the number, if 
each minute 105 pages, each 
hour then process 6,300 people, 12 series printing machine simultaneously use 
then each hour may process 75,600 people, namely may process 1.8144 million 
people every day! If what, suffices advanced? Has when the need also may add 
many several computers as necessary, merely then can increase the hospital 
through the purchase extra computer and series printing machine we the handling 
ability, the website server frequency width also is may add as necessary! This 
is the ancient Chinese medicine inside story, is the traditional culture 
modernization value, is the millennium traditional culture precipitation, is not 
Arabian Nights. The computer place has not been allowed to use the express way 
to send to the prescription. Most importantly this hospital not only has treats 
the disease the function, but also has the prevention disease the function (to 
govern has not gotten sick)! I can the sufficient resources (after people 
understand Chinese medicine gathers manpower physical resource) continues to 
study the discussion to propagate the China traditional culture, trains the 
medical outstanding talented person, thinks the Chinese people. This work 
significance and is great, causes the astronautics also to pale by comparison, 
although the astronautics gathered and has used the national resources.</p>

<p>When IBM super computer Blue Gene is published, the world "is all crazy for 
it". This section super computer operating speed is in front of IBM develops 
"the dark blue computer" 100 times, are the present world operating speed 
quickest computers, this computer will fold the topic in the protein in the 
explanation process the extremely vital role. The protein folds the question is 
"the 21st century biophysics" important topic, if can untie this strange 
profound and secret, will raise an epoch-making revolution in the medicine and 
the medical care domain (in the protein control human body all cells process, 
they will fold decide its function the highly complex three dimensional shape. 
In folds any spot change which in the process occurs, can "turn ideal protein 
some kind of disease the business agent"). IBM research and development 
department Vice-President Paulo. horne said that, "one day, you possibly can 
enter this kind of clinic: In the clinic does not have doctor, only some 
computer, it can suffice for you to inspect the body, discovers suffers your 
pathogen, then acts according to your unique gene structure to open most suits 
your formula." Only is the Chinese medicine by the brand-new standpoint and the 
different concept, now and provides the so leading service on the annotation! 
Later will treat an illness does not have to leave the gate again.  </p>
<p>We also may 
through own high tech backstage support, in the countryside city establishment 
vending machine, provide the Chinese native medicine end product for have no way 
to access the net, or does not have the people which the time boils the 
medicine, becomes a low cost the Chinese medicine hospital. Also may develop the 
precious Chinese medicine science and technology superiority the world, the 
Chinese medicine hospital which the establishment spreads all over. </p>
<p>But the Western hospital present electron 
degree merely limits to the recording storage medical record, the printing 
prescription, the help delimits price with the charge, future also only will be 
able to limit to this, did not forget, they used are the toxicant! If 2005- 
09-25 news Beijing carries out the electronic prescription big hospital to 
delimit price the charge Windows merge, center lifts the example, only was the 
time which received a medical examination reduced 27 minutes: "20 year-old Mr. 
Zhang because goes see a doctor the cold to x x hospital, opens in doctor in the 
electronic prescription, reporter saw in the prescription diagnoses a fence 
series printing" the upper respiratory tract infection ", medicine" a spore 
pulls decides the capsule ", back attaches the measurement and the usage, the 
right under angle hits has doctor the name and doctor's own handwriting 
signature. Soon after, Mr. Zhang directly takes the formula to paying fee place, 
did not need to like equally delimits price in the past, pay in full spent 
directly to the pharmacy recipe. Reporter has calculated the time for him: 
Registers 3 minutes, receives a medical examination 10 minutes, pays fee 5 
minutes, the recipe 5 minutes. Outside except lines up, he received a medical 
examination has altogether used 23 minutes. Before the patient comes the 
hospital to complete these links at least to need 50 minute clocks." </p>

<p>
These Western 
medicine directs to think arrogant "electron", we already complete in the DOS 
age. Moreover, spend for half hour to watch a cold, but also has not added on 
lines up and goes and returns the time, as well as expensive expense, also is 
unworthy proud or is arrogant. At the same time, the patient untold hardships 
obtain the curative effect certainly not firmly western medicine, itself has 
serious and firmly the poisonous side effect! This spot, Western doctor and the 
patients all have the mouth difficult word or are miserable beyond description. 
The Chinese medicine already by far walked in theirs front, they also in and 
misdiagnose for the disease diagnosis is tired out from the press is in an 
extremely difficult situation, the Chinese medicine already may pointed prevent 
the disease, the Chinese medicine does not need the end of hills and rivers to 
come to light only then knew the cancer the occurrence, may guard against mishap 
however has not nipped in the bud, ahead of time before cancer forming prevents 
and treats it, has certainly also contained other diseases. The Chinese medicine 
already crossed to the disease diagnosis pass, early already understood the use 
natural harmless matter treatment and the prevention disease, the patient only 
must simply follow according to the side uses for parts then, moreover the 
charges for medicine also only several cents money, own access the net the 
printing prescription also was snaps fingers as soon as to wield the matter, 
definitely does not need 1 minute</p>
<p>Our ancestors when ancient times, has Tang 
Fangk'o on the stele, lets needing voluntarily press the side to use for parts, 
looks for a steed with the aid of its picture, curative effect suddenly. In 
Internet today, we will inherit develop, the ancient traditional Chinese 
medicine modernization electron, will move to the Chinese medicine hospital on 
the Internet, with will get sick differently governs, treats different diseases 
with the same method, ices source Yu Shuier coldly to the water, pupil surpasses 
the teacher will win to blue, in addition the space and time factor 
strengthening curative effect, the convenient patient, will not need Fatigue of 
travel, will be direct on-line voluntarily downloads then. On-line Tang Fang is 
the ancient tablet Tang Fang continuation and development, faithfully has 
inherited the ancient Chinese medicine essence, displays incisively the Golden 
Mean. Takes this side not to have to diagnose, does not need observation, the 
old person young children are all appropriate, any person all may take, is 
suitable for any person, serves to the world. 99% patient take the first soup 
side (on third) namely to be able to be effective, medicine to sickness 
institute! Even after 60% patient take medicine 1-20 minute effective (to have 
immediate recording), 80% patient same day are effective. 

 </p>
<p>We are inheriting the foundation has obtained 
the significant technological breakthrough, these technologies "shock" certainly 
majority medical worker. Our Chinese medicine prescription has the prevention 
treatment known and the unknown disease function , all has the curative effect 
to any disease, because uses is Gao Chieh principle of detailed balance (is not 
ignorant kills by poison), is Guang Pu and the omni-directional product, may the 
big area and large-scale launches the service. The Golden Mean, the doctrine of 
the mean, has balanced, has balanced the human body channels and collaterals, 
the vital organs of the human body friendly blood mind and body has balanced, 
the human body has been healthy on the nature, the resistivity enhanced, also 
naturally was allowed to prevent the protection known and the unknown disease! 
This, is the Chinese medicine characteristic.</p>
<p>Natural food and the natural --health can like 
you hope the sesame seed mung bean soup, the true traditional Chinese medicine, 
the standard China traditional culture, causes the beauty with the river chart 
Luo river book number and the space and time relations to gather one, was not 
kills by poison (typhus to discuss has contained number, but has not contained 
space and time), was another level civilization, certainly not the Western 
medicine could understand and persuade by reasoning, might not place on a par or 
the same date says. This Chinese medicine prescription is breaks a code to the 
ancient Book of Changes's annotation, everybody may easily the feeling and the 
experience, the feeling Chinese medicine artlessness 
plain and great, experiences Yi Hsueh simple not to be easy and the change. We 
use twenty years to carry on the recast work regarding this, had the 
epoch-making significance to the medical system -- to break through the Western 
medicine thought pattern, has propagated the ancient Chinese medicine, prevented 
and controlled outside the basic function through the simple inexpensive Chinese 
native medicine support many kinds of diseases, had makes one lean the goal 
innovation! This is the present any kind of medical service system does not 
have, is a completely independent Chinese medicine product, is worth the 
treasure which receives the best ritual agree to gaze, is the common people 
health dawn. The soup side composition uses extremely ordinary commonly used 
food (present law certainly not to think these foods are medicine), the medicine 
does not recover, makes the medium using the Internet, has easily to obtain, the 
suffering conveniently, the operation simple, safe highly effective, the 
compatible various countries' law and so on the fine characteristic, has solved 
certain countries to the Chinese medicine law and the limit question, has solved 
the problem which the money has not been able to see a doctor, the significance 
is extraordinary in the world medical service health history. </p>
<p>The parents in not far swim, only is in the real life are many with 
difficulty so. Loyalty and 
filial piety was difficult to be 
satisfactory to both sides since old times, very many people were unable serve 
to present nearby the body, the sub- desire raised did not kiss in the scene 
disappointed to lose the will. The world most cannot wait for the matter 
sentiment not too is filial piety the parents, also is in good health while the 
parents hurries to be filial piety, lets their health, lets them be joyful. Let 
the parents take the on-line soup side, the keeping in good health health care, 
prevents disease treats an illness, prolongs the life, also the filial piety, loyalty 
and filial piety two has not harmed from now 
on, even compares looks after by oneself fortunately. The overseas decoy, Yun 
the Yun scholar, goes off to study the another region, is unfamiliar with the 
people and the place, did not know where looks for the Chinese medicine, also 
may use this. When you will look back on in the future in the past, certainly 
will be able extremely not to rejoice and we "brushes past"!</p>

<p>Speaks of the Chinese medicine the principle, just like we can drive well, 
the necessity had not understood the motor car engine the principle, or 
understood boards rides also similarly may, Lian Hsueh drived all exempts; In 
the hotel room, can turn on the air conditioner the switch then, does not have 
to know this air conditioner the sign model or leaves the plant the year, much 
less some is the central air conditioning, see the air conditioner shadow in the 
room, but same nobody for this inquiry; Your excellency eats meal when uses is 
the rice bowl, what day He Ch'angho year what month of when who produces? Not 
also equally may eat to the full; That great modern scientist attracts the first 
air in him time, has had thought or has asked the breath principle? Definitely 
does not have, because some speeches are certainly exactly inadequate; The 
Chinese medicine may treat an illness, might as well first cures said again, at 
the appointed time like your excellency does not need for the life to rush 
about, may sit down slowly glances through the Chinese medicine the classical 
medicine, sufficiently wears down several lifetime the times (we to be allowed 
to provide Chinese medicine books table of contents for needing, or may 
voluntarily go to library consult), the foundation which because simple 
effective is easy behind Chinese medicine which uses to contain and oddity 
secret, is not in the short time may grasp 
for the major part person, is not three words two languages may explain white. 
Or leaves the lifelike portrait like painter three two on the drawing, whether 
your excellency did know he has paid several dozens years time for this? 
Therefore, frequently shouted says the truth, is how pale ignorant, not the 
politeness and is pitiful. If that in rides in front of gentleman requests the 
driver to say the engine the principle of work only then to board... ... 
</p>
<p>Some people 
thought this is be mysterious, treats the illness to save the patient can the 
knowledge, how to the perception be so generally broad. May understand that, 
Chinese culture itself was 
abstract 
and the system, the Chinese medicine also indeed is treats an illness with the 
bark stock, moreover the seven emotions and six sensory pleasures can affect the 
health and the organism resistivity or the immunity, simultaneously center the 
medical ten channels and collaterals solved the Western medicine to use the 
disease and the question which four Wan Toke the subject has not still 
straightened out; Our ancestors the fire clay knows the world with Jin Mushui, 
five lines of theories in fact far compared to the modern science molecular 
formula, the equation or the theorem law are also complete, at least according 
to us to know until now not yet changes, but the modern science besides 
mathematics, all scientific theorems law all and overthrows in the unceasing 
establishment bustles about; Outside the China traditional culture concept is it 
greatly does not have in, it slightly does not have, hundred lines of filial 
piety for first, if fries boils the Chinese native medicine point of view to be 
able to affect the curative effect (this far morning which comes compared to 
butterfly effect, moreover also already instructs clinically), or like in 
Buddhist studies bowl water has surely an infinite universe, is after all the 
level is different, the Chinese culture philosophy has contained the western 
philosophy, possibly is precisely because of feels but then passes. The Chinese 
medicine not only may be highly effective, moreover also may the medicine not 
recover!</p>

No matter is the

can effectively guarantee the organism the security and the health. The 
prevention is most effective "waits at ease for an exhausted enemy " the method, 
otherwise only can be attends to one thing without losing track of another thing 
badly battered, the Chinese medicine not only can suffice to treat the disease, 
moreover also can suffice effectively to prevent the disease, this is the 
Chinese medicine can suffice to continue one of several millenniums reasons.</p>
<p>Uses the toxicant 
poisonous side effect along with the Western medicine appearing, its question 
appears day by day seriously. Above medicine examination minimum need century 
time!Also was said present the western medicine is not all mature, still waited 
for the examination! Because the medicine influence is very profound, may reach 
life-long and the later ages, much less toxicant and manual synthesis chemical! 
Very many chemicals because test environmental condition different, obtains 
conclusion also entirely different, if outside the human body experiment is 
non-toxic harmless effective, but has entered the human body is virulent harmful 
is invalid, even is causes 
cancer 
cripples lethally, the calamity extends several generations! Although the great 
scientists continuously are relying on this to make money.</p>
<p>The gene topic just appeared on the market, the scientists were ready to 
fight, jubilant, now likes by the frost is hit has resembled. Transformation 
gene produces which from the gene transformation crops, confirmed can transfer 
breeds the area wild plant, then creates one kind from not to see, can to resist 
the force weed killer "the super weed". The scientist originally thinks the gene 
transformation the rape with it "the distant relative" between the wild leaf 
mustard nearly not the impossible overlapping reproduction, however followed 
closely the hereafter actually also to confirm this kind of overlapping 
reproduction. Differently convenes the method with the before scientist which 
large-scale reporter can widely propagandize greatly for is, the scientific 
circles for two years can seriously affect the crops to this kind the discovery, 
continuously are actually stuffy do not speak. These discoveries to uses the 
gene science and technology to transform the crops is a serious attack, to other 
gene research applications also however. The government ore solemnly to us 
guaranteed this cannot occur, however, the truth is reappearing after is actually hidden. 
 </p>
<p>American Johns - the Hopkins university's 
scientist "Natural Genetics" in the magazine reported in the newest issue that, 
They discovered many laboratories cultivation the human embryo does cell line 
can have the gene variation in the cell division later period! Human embryo stem 
cell cultivation time longer, cell division number of times more, thus in the 
fission process DNA (deacidizing ribonucleic acid (RNA)) duplicates the mistake 
which possibly appears to be more. They did to the American federation 
government approval cultivation 9 kind of human embryo cell line have conducted 
the research, discovered in fission dozens of from now on, 8 kind of embryos did 
cell line can appear above one kind in the human cancer cell the universal 
existence gene variation. At the beginning of 2005, 
the American University of California's scientists confirmed that, at present 
all human embryo did cell line has been polluted animal source culture medium in 
the raise and in the induction differentiation process, caused one kind of 
humanity the member which could not synthesize in the heredity to enter in the 
stem cell. Now, in 2005, also discovers 
the human embryo stem cell cultivation another malpractice. The scientist 
continuously thought may use this kind of cell to cultivate the human organ and 
to carry on the human body to transplant. But, this method of treatment is 
confirmed the existence question. </p>
<p>Craig Venter&nbsp; 
 
is the world-famous gene expert, once studied the gene group stochastic 
arrangement method, has made the significant contribution to the gene research. 
In 2000, he has published the fruit fly 
nearly complete gene atlas. After a year, also has published the human gene 
atlas rough draft. He said that, Today, we have grasped the technology, can 
suffice to identify and to compile many species the gene atlases, but this with 
understood the human physiology structure completely is two matters. The 
bacterium gene structure quite is easy to understand and to identify, but the 
multi- cells fresh laws of nature is much more complex, looks like the humanity 
then to have million hundred million cells, wants the one by one understanding 
certainly to be sure easy matter. Approximately some three tenths cancers are 
because the gene will appear the day after tomorrow to change but, but we not 
impossible only to depend on the gene to estimate and the control life each 
step, will be completely grasps the individual cell the operation material, also 
will be insufficient to to forecast the health or the disease, much less the 
human body will have million hundred million cells?......

only depends on the development which the 
present science proceeds in an orderly way, is is impossible to reach to this 
goal. Just because we still grasped to own gene material not deeply, I thought 
the future during 20 years we all will not be supposed to carry on humanity's 
gene transformation project, because we have not simply had the ability to deal 
with this kind of technology. </p>
<p>Very many

The Western 
medicine courage and wisdom and they receive the science training, sufficiently 
lets them establish the innumerable suppositions and the theory, after announces 
with wishes fulfilled ten year or twenty years happily has the anti- AIDS the 
vaccine (own how to 
to say how to 
says, this guts or the courage and wisdom said, really is unprecedented, has 
forgotten before this the self-praise so-called scientist's rigorousness, but 
does not have to take any responsibility for it, likes the modern popular 
limited company to be same, may clap as necessary to leave, already stated was 
the limited liability, does not need any compunction or is restless. 
Simultaneously this is one kind of arbitrary, also is one kind of misleading! 
All arbitrary conclusions all appear too early, everybody should not lower one's 
guard for this with negligent in precaution, 
should not for sell candy gentleman's promise to bring harm to oneself and to 
others). The patients believe in firmly to the Western medicine science and the 
advanced advertisements propaganda, but in the matter reality the Western 
medicine harmful is useless to the human body health, does not have the 
scientific basis, is for sell its product but to public's threat, is the through 
pseudo-science and the commercial cheat, even is has complete disregard for 
human life. This with the Chinese tradition reputation or the prestige is 
completely two matters, also because of this, has decided the modern science 
(including the Western medicine) the limited depth, limited prospect, with 
limited effect. Why has "the Kyoto Protocol"? Taunts is this moves out oneself 
pounds when the oneself foot the stone itself also to be possible to bring the 
opportunity. "covers 
Asia's theory&#8221;
to believe that, on 
Earth's biological energy adjustment environment maintains own health, if the 
coral and the seaweed, already evolved a set voluntarily to reduce the water 
temperature or to reduce the ultraviolet ray the biological mechanism to reduce 
the greenhouse effect. They when radiate faced with the high temperature or the 
strong ultraviolet ray, can release the dimethyl sulfur, forms in its place 
above sea level richly to contain the dimethyl sulfur the sea water, and is led 
by the wind the atmosphere, turns the aerosol suspended particulate matter, the 
steam is easy to gather forms the cloud on the particle, the promotion cloud 
formation, has the very tremendous influence to the area climate. Perhaps said 
the great scientist certainly is not on Earth's biology, but also does not 
compare the coral or the seaweed, therefore only then had the bionics, also only 
has the time which attends to one thing without losing track of another thing 
only then remembers the negligence or fear felt when thinking of something after 
the fact, is the question withstands this evil consequence by who. If we in mine 
coal and mining petroleum time whether or not has thought a deeper thing? And 
what is more massively excavates the coral to come the calcined lime, so that 
the artificial sea bed ecology disaster, the sea water rise sand beach changes 
smelly, billion years form the stable ecology on is removed by the intelligent 
humanity for the not worthy of mentioning lime the bottom to destroy all of a 
sudden, how ignorance and greedy! The idiom has stretches the facts, the proverb 
has chops the toe to evade the sand insect, the west has the young girl for to 
exempt the breast cancer in front of 18 years old on the double 
breast excision, the Western there medicine then there has the question to cut, 
or simply trades newly......, 
this is inherits.</p>
<p>
As early as in
19th century, the 
Austrian scientists mendel then proposed that, decided the organism 
characteristic the gene pairs the existence in the cell, comes from male parent, 
comes from female parent, this then was at present still instructs each 
scientific research the heredity law. But, the American Purdue university's 
newest research runs counter to as if with it, they in the experiment discovered 
one kind of plant can suffice some heredity codes which rewrites the obeying the 
father (mother) place to inherit, but (mother) this DNA fragment (deoxyribonucleic 
acid) achieves the unification with the grandfather, these plant later ages or 
two DNA
duplicate this have 
all carried on rewriting to the HOTHEAD gene, (mother) not the normal 
gene fragment rewrites the father with the ancestor parents' consistent normal 
fragment. This kind of plant rewrites the DNA fragment for the ancestor 
form situation frequent occurrence, similar "the gene backs up" 

appear like 
also appears on the person, this has broken the heredity law which the scientist 
continuously follows! ! Is said that, we continuously are all deceived by the 
scientists, although the scientists are the like this weakness. Likes some
200 ten thousand years 

ancient tree, 
is called the dinosaur time the live fossil --tile to force steps the cedar, 
once was dinosaur's food, the scientist in order to determine 
ancient tree 
the age, saw very simply saw up then, but this already will be the person 
condemned for all time! This tree experienced surely the year repeated 
difficulties to live down, actually as soon as is sawn by the science scientist 
does not saw! This is a scientist! Pitiful scientist.</p>
<p>Wrong Einstein 
restricted theory of relativity target speed of light constant law: Studies 
according to the England Cambridge University astronomy research institute 
expert, the speed of light meets on time slows down, if so, the restricted 
theory of relativity foundation namely has harms. They analyze from 143 photostars light, finally 
demonstrated, the survey atom unifies in together strength size "fine structural 
constant", since the universe big detonation, slowed down approximately 0.001 %, 
therefore, is closely linked with the fine structural constant the speed of 
light naturally is unable invariablely, so proved Einstein has harms. This team 
by no means direct measure speed of light, but is the light which the analysis 
remote "the quasi-stellar object" transmits; These quasi-stellar objects light 
consumes for ten hundred million years only then to arrive at the Earth, lets 
the scientist understand the universe initial period the basic law. The position 
huge "kyker" the telescope demonstrated in Hawaii that, certain wave lengths 
being possible only are absorbed change.</p>
<p>Since the 
scientists hundred years continuously thought the birds are stupid, namely
"the stupid bird ", 
thought bird's cerebrum mainly is the basis ganglion, this region control simple 
cerebrum function and instinct behavior. But these two all are not in fact 
right, moreover the basis ganglion is not a simple region. In February, 2005"Natural 
Nerve Science Commentary" reported, Duke University nerve biologist (Airidge 
Jiaweici)
leads a birds expert 
international group announced, birds' cerebrum and any mammal's cerebrum is 
same, is complex, is nimble, has creatively, in the related birds cerebrum 
anatomy textbook writes nearly all is wrong! Related bird's cerebral cortex with 
"intelligence " the majority view, needs to rewrite, has also must make the 
significant revision about the brain structure academic naming principle. Birds 
cerebrum Cheng Ts'utsu weaves undertakes and the cerebral cortex approaches the 
similar effect, this enables its not only to depend upon the instinct to 
survive, but also may remember the different scene, the academic society higher 
mammal's many kinds of skills. If the crow can lay aside three ten thousand 
grain of seeds, 6 months later again will 
retrieve, when its Tibet food if discovered other birds will watch in the one 
side, their a while has been able quietly to come back food rehides. Magpie when 
childhood had the comprehension faculty which fully suffices, knew an object 
hides in curtain 
back certainly did not explain this object already vanished.</p>
<p>The modern 
astronomy thought that, The galaxy formation is unceasingly fuses into a bigger 
galaxy by the small galaxy, but this theory has been broken, the astronomy 
circle needs reto know the galaxy the forming process. Has the astronomer to use 
the American outer space head office "Si pitzer" the infrared telescope and 
"Kazak suddenly" the outer space telescope, discovered is born to the universe 
forms the initial period the giant mature galaxy, this galaxy star forms as if 
in the galaxy. This galaxy forms the time, might trace to the universe age not 
to ten hundred million years ancient times time, only is the nowadays universe 
age 6%, the size actually had 130 hundred million year after year ages Milky 
Way's eight times. Now has 1,100 principles according to to urge the thorough 
research, is determined the first such galaxy starts the time in "the universe 
daybreak" which forms. But this, is the great scientist the matter which does.</p>
<p>
Everybody should 
also be able clearly to remember 2000 millennium insect question, 
this also is the great scientist lacks the foresight to create (the recording 
year way to be supposed to be 4 figures, but the computer scientists have only 
used 2, creates the world range 
century crisis, had the unprecedented confusion, is panic loss which and 
estimates with difficulty! The so simple year question, also may suddenly appear 
the great scientist's great superficiality..., 
scientist's official duty is is engaged in the scientific research, the 
scientific research is moves towards the truth from the error the process, 
namely the science in walks to truth in front of process itself is wrong, all 
contemporary science all is mature by no means, the science thought today to, 
tomorrow often will be wrong! The like this science is worth following or 
yearning for? Front crosses river needs to have strategic the judgement, 
otherwise what comes the field to envy the horse racing (same horses, because 
exchanges competes enters the stage order, obtains result which converts failure 
into victory).</p>
<p>In the Western medicine cancer chemotherapy, 
the cancer cell can increase some protein the production, these protein mass 
energy will enter in the cell the medicine to transport, will cause the medicine 
to expire, this kind of antibiotic nature will be one of main barriers which the 
present Western world medicine cancer treats. South Carolina medical college 
bryan. Tours "Biochemistry Magazine" on reports 
in 2005-05-27  
publication said that, one 
kind was previously considered only undertakes the structure function 
polymerization member hyaluric acid in the cell--, was initiates the cancer cell 
anti- medicine response the essential matter. The hyaluric acid can with its 
acceptor protein CD44  
union, 
-3

stir up with the phosphoric acid phaseomannite 
together, urges the cancer cell increase production to be able to transport the 
medicine the cell the protein, thus causes the cancer cell to have the 
antibiotic nature. In cancer cell hyaluric acid quantity more, the antibiotic 
nature is stronger. So long as with oppresses the anti- matter to prevent the 
hyaluric acid and the CD44  
acceptor 
protein union, can make the cancer cell to be more sensitive to the chemotherapy 
medicine, is helpful to the cancer chemotherapy. Before this the great 
scientists believed that, the hyaluric acid is in the cell one constitutive 
minute, it maintains in the organization the moisture content, and the 
maintenance organization cell elasticity, simultaneously also takes the 
extracellular matrix one kind of constitution "the frame ". Until now only then 
discovered it in process and so on inflammation, canceration and cancer cell 
antibiotic nature has the function. The pitiful before this patients, accept are 
only not the mature advanced plans! However, the most major problem has been the 
present plan is mature? </p>

American president the biological ethics commission member, humanity bioengineering management plan 
person in charge France Si. Fushan indicated that, You must understand between 
the science application and the technical application has the very big 
difference, is not possesses the thing which can suffice in the science to 
realize to be able to turn the technology, and obtains widely applies. Cloned 
the person is a typical example --is 
very obvious, clones the person technology to let the human society the ethics, 
the morals as well as the law has encountered the unprecedented awkwardness and 
the confusion. Besides factor and so on ethics, some cultural taboos also will 
hinder the people in the future "to improve own footsteps ". The majority 
country all to progresses in the person the good medicine experiment to have all 
sorts of limits. Certainly, if does not have these limits, the medicine research 
development speed to be able to be quicker, but, such speech, our society can 
fall into the crisis<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">.</p>
<p>Tadpole's tail has 
the nature reproductive property, if you a tadpole's tail break off, period of 
time you have been able to discover it unexpectedly long left a new tail, but 
the tadpole grew up after turns the frog on no longer to have this kind of 
reproductive property. This is because tadpole in turns in frog's process, the 
gene signal has also had the change. The Chinese medicine may urge this gene 
signal to restore, then causes this ability restoration. The humanity belongs to 
row of the animal which has the reproductive property, its itself also retained 
the regeneration ability, including the organ and the four limbs regeneration, 
is similar to the wound the regeneration to be same. Some one kind of bacterium 
belongs escapes bacterium sulfureum the family, this family's bacterium is very 
common in the fresh-water environment, moreover was contained by the human use 
elimination the sulfur the organic pollutant. It when external environment 
disadvantageous or nutrient insufficiency, escapes bacterium sulfureum may turn

and so on in the adverse circumstance to survive, once the environment is 
advantageous may grow into the normal state the strain. If we can suffice 
through the Chinese medicine help to cause the humanity to change stronger and 
have the survivability, why then we not such do?</p>
<p>
Our here only is 
offers a few ordinary introductory remarks so that others may offer their 
valuable ideas, the all over Chinese native medicine resources is the farmer 
medical service question only outlet, simultaneously tells the people the 
Chinese medicine is is unable with the Western medicine knowledge or the method 
understood and the understanding, the Western medicine is impossible to 
understand the sesame seed mung bean the function (although prescription is 
public)! Hoped the Chinese medicine and the people which is interested to the 
Chinese medicine, the numerous wills become the city, for the Chinese medicine, 
for the traditional culture, for ours descendant, inherits the Chinese medicine 
and lets the Chinese medicine survive in name only in our this generation. 
Starts from me, learns the Chinese medicine the foundation knowledge, grasps 
observation, namely sufficiently instructs clinically. Does not need corruptly 
greatly asks the ocean, to blindly worship foreign things, good Gao Wuyuan, does 
not need three big conventions, the stethoscope, the sphygmomanometer, the 
electrocardiogram, the supersonic wave, the radioactivity, the isotope, the 
fault scanning, the toxicant (the Western medicine is basic is with principle 
which kills by poison) and so on the shape but the under tool, in fact these 
very can make money the tool also does not have any medical value! Attractive 
center does not use, merely is the enhancement lacks the self-confidence 
confidence, if the present Western world medicine most advanced positron radial 
fault scanning (PET)
installs only can discover 5 to 10 millimeters sizes tumors, can 
discover 3
millimeters below 
tumors the new installments then are hopeful in 2008 to be able to appear on the 
market (compare with the normal cell, the cancer cell can absorb more glucose. 
Using cancer cell's this characteristic, for is injected by the inspector joins 
the radioactive substance the glucose, whether there is judges the tumor through 
the monitor radioactive rays, this method is called PET). 
No matter 3
millimeters or 5 millimeter tumors, all were 
already form, already was the later period (namely 3 millimeters or 5 millimeter tumors already was 
later period)! Although 3 millimeters either 5 millimeter tumors are 300 millimeters or 500 millimeter tumors early 
times, but also is 50 step smiles hundred steps, depends on this, we also want 
three to think this science advancement, 
is whether mature and whether should use it. But the Chinese medicine 
observation, may discover less than a millimeter 
tumor, may not discover the formed tumor, even may ahead of time 30 years discovery! Now at last 
is the early time discovered that, now at last is begins work (this time to be 
allowed 100% to cure)! Treasures own traditional culture.</p>

Cares for the aged 
the system and the social security question: According to the China census and 
the population research center forecast data display, front and rear 2030, 
the Chinese 60 year old of above old age 
population estimated will increase to four about the hundreds million, quite now 
European Union 15 countries population sum 
total. To 
2050, China 60 year old of and 65 year old of above old age 
population total respectively achieved 450 million and 335 million, 
in this meaning every three people were having an old person, China already 
strides in old age social the threshold. In May, 2005, 
World Bank announcement future the pension balance of payment memoir pointed out 
about China that, according to the present system pattern (mainly is Western 
medicine medical expense expenditure), to 2075, 
the China basic old-age insurance revenue and expenditure will be short of $915 
Thousand Trillion 
funds. How solves cares for the aged social security question and so on system 
is becoming a Chinese stern test, the development Chinese medicine melts the 
risk to become the national strategy high consideration question. This with when 
will challenge China's development, if China will be able to succeed overcomes 
the challenge to complete reforming, the entire world all will be able to obtain 
benefits from this prospect. So, the Chinese medicine shoulders the 
responsibility appears incomparably heavily.</p>
<p>Now people's custom is is sick first looked Western doctor, all spent the 
money or Western doctor gave up, only then came back looks at the Chinese 
medicine, this phenomenon 
shape paired doctor's many challenges. First, the Chinese medicine must let the 
patient understand any is is terminally ill, any also delays the condition, any 
is the prevention primarily, any also is begins work governs has not gotten 
sick, meanwhile must remind the patient present law to the Chinese medicine and 
the patient unfair, the patient is misled, finally suffered injury or the 
patient (to induce on picture has bought counterfeit goods or goods not to 
version, or smoking took drugs excessive drinking), including for this 
responsible people, the non- standard was model. 
And what is more, somewhat the critically ill patient which is given up by 
Western doctor, wants to request a Chinese medicine medicinal preparation 
medicine to have to bring back to life, otherwise is the inferior physician, 
this is a joke which we frequently meets, although the patient did not have the 
opportunity to smile in fact, we also feel bad for it. This situation is similar 
to modern people's being eager for quick success and immediate gain, some who 
are willing to go to the solid study or to recite the four books and five 
classics, in the market condition on common does not buy the degree and buys the 
test question (officials some people to deliver does not need to buy), in the 
reality work certainly does not need these only when the test must grasp 
knowledge, also some who in middle school university study the plane geometry 
three-dimensional geometry either the physiological biochemistry have used in 
the real life or needs to use? Now every one so thinks highly of English, except 
test when needs, also some who do need in the work? Including go 
abroad person! Whether the non- English-speaking country we don't need to 
go? This scenery cannot be long. Was time self-criticism modern education system 
and gives careful consideration the question which the tradition national 
culture inherited and develops, including traditional character.  </p>
<p>We knew that, about the cerebrum the hemisphere 
carries on the thought by the different way, the left brain favors to uses the 
language abstract to 
carry on the thought, the right brain favors to felt the figure carries on the 
direct thought about, only has unifies, can have the most perfect creative 
thought. General  
"read-write 
calculated" 
the 
education way is uses the left half brain the mechanical memorizing, the figure 
thought aspect quite is bad. Indicated to the right brain research that, the 
figure thought accepts the quantity which the information stimulates is language
1,000  
times, 
1

month memorizes 
1,000

words, or 
5

minutes remember 
100

words, these all do not calculate any miracle, 
so long as you can suffice skilled to utilize the figure thought, can develop 
the right brain. It is said German calls celler the person can suffice 
24

volumes big encyclopedias to know by heart, his 
means are abstract 
the information transforms the fixed picture, and according to needs to carry on 
the classification grouping. Chinese figure writing namely inborn has this 
characteristic and the merit! From this time on may see our ancestor's wise 
foresight and be great (traditional culture to live simply fame and fortune and 
psychological balance also all directly has benign function to right brain 
development, otherwise is advantage wants to cloud the mind, is blinded by 
greed, money-mad capacity for clear thinking). Why this the traditional 
character simplified the truth which was instead more difficult to study, 
simultaneously also needed to pay attention the simplified character "the love " 
was does not have "the heart ", namely unintentionally the love, continuously 
for a long time hence......, certainly 
also includes other torn to pieces after was torn to pieces......</p>
<p>The Chinese medicine and the Western medicine are entirely 
different, including diagnosis, if AIDS CD4  
is 
only one of Western medicine judgement resistivity targets, certainly 
incompletely/the integrity responded person's resistivity, its itself limits 
very much, or is not comprehensive, is said is unreliable or does not have the 
value, does not have to pay attention (including other inspections)! We in on 
clinical also frequently saw accepts AIDS person's 
CD4

which Western doctor treats slowly to rise, but 
simultaneously his/her the whole body condition also hurriedly is dropping, the 
most patients can not but give up continue to accept the treatment, because not 
good (has liked surgery was already successful, but person is exactly 
inadequate, because person whether does survive or cures closes the Western 
doctor's matter, Western doctor only is is responsible obediently operates, oh, 
in this question book has not written, I am sorry). 
The Chinese medicine is take the lung after with the large intestine after as a 
target. The Chinese medicine treats itself then enhances the human body the 
immunity, the Chinese medicine is the overall immunity. The Chinese medicine 
overall immunity category 
has contained Western medicine CD4, 5, 6..., 
the use Chinese medicine treatment, should use the Chinese medicine the 
viewpoint to observe, but did not suggest or should not use the Western medicine 
incomplete view review jian 
it; Was similar to the pulmonary tuberculosis calcification only to explain the 
past, did not express the present has any question. When person's ear because 
the strong noise has been injured when loses one's hearing, the Western medicine 
thought is the auditory nerve suffers injury, is irreversible; The Chinese 
medicine thought is the human body protects oneself the function to shield the 
ear function hibernation/shock it, namely the human body corresponding protects 
oneself the valve automatic shut-off, in order to avoid aggravates with the 
influence related other organs, the Chinese medicine treatment principle is 
reopens/opens it, the premise is knew this valve and opens the valve in there 
the password, namely that channels and collaterals do not pass or are not 
balanced. The Chinese medicine does not need the Western medicine 
the HIV

examination, does not need 
the DNA

arrangement, also does not need to wait for the 
data to come out, may prescribe medicine, has from becomes a body the diagnosis 
and the treatment system, is quickly reliable, please felt relieved. Including 
three big conventions, the electrocardiogram, 
X-ray, 
assistance inspection and so on CT  
/ 
assists the administrative offices/assistance......, 
did not forget, this only was the as the name suggests "assistance". 
Since the near twenty years, the Western medicine auxiliary method has become 
the most important method, even became has sought money the method, hateful! In 
the true Chinese medicine of eye, should be only sick division of person and the 
non- patient, but does not have the hepatitis B patient and the AIDS patient's 
distinction (because this only is Western medicine nearly hundred years matter)! 
Otherwise was not the Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine as early as before 
millennium already was mature! Only if is the Chinese medicine which the Western 
medicine teaches, or the pastor teaches buddhist priest, because professor is 
certainly incomplete, quotes out of context, shed book at the end of chasing, 
even will be most important or has valuably discarded, apart millimeter 
great distance of the difference, namely was similar to in the animal purebred 
and non- purebred (hybrid) the division, not roentgen not kind.

The Chinese medicine and the doctor practicing western medicine most greatly respectively 
are the Chinese medicine may cure the disease (including heart disease, 
hypertension, diabetes, cold and all kinds of cancer sickness), the doctor 
practicing western medicine is coexists for ever and ever with Mr., accompanies 
as necessary in the royal entourage (also includes the heart disease, the 
hypertension, the diabetes and the cold, but does not include the cancer, 
because the cancer the survival time too is short in doctor practicing western 
medicine's hand, therefore the doctor practicing western medicine hates to the 
marrow of the bones to the cancer, Mr. does not see them to receive the cancer 
patient's money is with ten thousand receives for the unit, but the heart

			&#962;-energy fang and the sesame seed mung bean side very is all simple, 
but did not forget: Life itself is very simple, the breath is simpler! The 
person arrives the first matter which this world does is an inspiration tone, 
leaves when this world makes last the matter also exhales last the tone. An any 
time tone cannot come up or swallow 
not under this tone, is a life! Simple? Simple, but extremely is also numerous 
and diverse! So that the humanity until now still did not understand in this the 
reason, what is a life? Or what is the life? First the number of days and the 
latter number of days also are extremely simple, 12345678 only, preschool's 
children can read, but the question also is precisely because too is simple, the 
scientists all looked does not glance (because of them not understand, 
may I ask, did not ask does not understand), therefore has to talk 
irresponsibly, also did not have the scientific basis.</p>
<p>
Although "the 
scientific basis", "the unscientific truth", "the scientific data", "has been 
unscientific", is that pale empty incapable and is ridiculously childish, but 
the foot has sufficed all to hinder the unscientific thing which the scientists 
seeks profit to banish to the lowest hell! Is authorized to the flavor is really 
good, may ride roughshod, vertically and horizontally unmatched in the world 
hand.</p>
<p>You have heard the star anise? You have used the star anise? You have eaten 
the star anise? Swiss medicament business roche group (Roche) 
the so-called disease-resistant poisonous medicine "Tamiflu

" is becomes take the star anise as the raw 
material refinement:) Although the especially sensitive luck still waited for 
the experiment, certainly could not prevent the birds and beasts flu, moreover
the H5N1  
virus had the antibiotic nature 
regarding this (05-10-16). However, under 
specialized packing and propaganda, like "raw material short, when production is 
easy to explode, the drugs manufacture takes time the exceed year, other 
pharmaceutical factories must meet the production requirement and the scale need 
important contract two three years and so on ", the especially sensitive luck 
has become the present world "the resistance birds and beasts flu liberator ", 
the people stored up this medicine in abundance, in the trade already obtain the 
perfect success! The curative effect, your excellency takes care of oneself, the 
cargo leaves the gate generally not to exchange a purchase. This time, whether 
should thought the Chinese medicine? </p>
<p>Chinese medicine theory and Chinese native medicine principle, although is 
completely different with the Western medicine, even lives far apart, the huge 
difference, the water and fire is not accommodating, but is at for the benefit, 
the Western medicine actually needs to use the Western medicine the theory 
instruction Chinese medicine, norm 
the Chinese medicine, castrates the Chinese medicine! Analyzes the Chinese 
native medicine with the western medicine principle the active principle, 
verifies the Chinese medicine with the Western medicine view the theory.  </p>
<p>The Chinese medicine by the Western medicine study which pitifully which opens the modern traditional Chinese 
medicine college raises, already abandoned the medicine to save the medicine, 
degenerates into "uses the Chinese native medicine the Chinese medicine ", but 
non- tradition "Chinese medicine ". How many filled with warm-blooded Yun the 
Yun scholar, is ambitious the gentleman so to fall into error, for the west 
pharmaceutical factory works as the salesman has gone, although they originally 
thought or now still thought may be totally dedicated to one's country, rescues 
the sickness! </p>
<p>Chinese medicine actually very simple, the 
Golden Mean, the whole is balanced, not general rule pain. Enhanced person's 
resistivity, human body itself own naturally knew how resists the disease, 
resists the disease, then treats all the various illnesses, moreover non-toxic 
is harmless! The Chinese medicine is equal to the rear services unit, provides 
the military supplies and the support, is not substitutes for the human body the 
function or the function, oversteps authority and gets involved in another's 
affaris, proclaims the guest to seize the host. This law far easy to learn 
becomes reconciled compared to the Western medicine grasps, most importantly is 
wiser, does not have the poisonous side effect. Cannot kill the chicken to use 
the oxen knife, regains a city with a atomic bomb, destroys the entire city, 
although inside has many priceless things, including justice and human 
conscience. On the highway drives, does not have to pay attention to an export 
is far, does not have to know the east longitude/north latitude the number of 
degree, or several counterclockwise several right extensions, counterclockwise 
how many right extension how many; Pays attention looked the index plate then, 
has a look the scenery, is proceeding along the road, this is a method, allowed 
nature to take its course, had known could be suitable, along was walking, could 
evade, evades the important questions for the easy, evades the calamity to avoid 
disaster, this was natural, also was the easy method! </p>
<p>The Chinese culture is extremely simple, simply 
to unbelievable, even is dizzy! But, this was traditional and the standard 
Chinese culture, gentle simple several near primitive, did not have any to be 
pleasantly surprised or the surprise, however the life on in this primitive 
center birth lived. </p>
<p>The Chinese medicine is not is unscientific, but was the Chinese medicine has already gone far beyond the science, has surmounted 
the science, the Chinese medicine was in advance. Also is said Chinese medicine 
far in front of Western medicine, the Western medicine "dreads" to the Chinese 
medicine formidable science and technology, also urges them to attempt to study 
and to grasp the Chinese medicine, and despicably forestalls to register the 
related patent, only is they too understood the Chinese medicine, the Chinese 
medicine was not their this level person may understand, the Chinese culture 
also was not they may clearness. </p>
<p>In the reality question, often discovered jumps over early, pays price 
smaller, but later, then pays the price is bigger. If quality question, if some 
quality question were discovered in the predesign, takes the measure to make the 
improvement the price is 1  US dollar speech, 
then was discovered in the product production stage, takes the correction 
measure to make the quality improvement the price is possibly 
100

US dollars; If when leaves the plant the 
examination only then were discovered, by now took the measure the price to be 
going to spend to go to 10,000  
US 
dollars; If is uses in the customer was discovered, even when customer use has 
had the quality accident, by now solved the question price possibly to have to 
amount to 100,000  
even 
1 million

US dollars. The disease question also is so, if 
some disease in embryonic stage time was discovered, takes the preventive 
measure to carry on the treatment the price is 
1

US dollar speech, then manifests suddenly the 
stage at the disease to discover, takes the remedial measure the price is 
possibly 100  
US dollars; If was serious 
when the condition only then were discovered, by now took the remedial measure 
the price to be going to spend to go to 10,000

US dollars; If in being terminally ill time only 
then was discovered, even when critically ill only then was discovered the 
condition the gravity, solved the question price possibly to have by now to 
achieve to million US dollars, even was he all, including life. Before the 
Chinese medicine is and starts at the disease start starts to treat, the Chinese 
medicine superior quality may easily deal with these issues, to eliminate all 
possible questions in the embryonic stage, creates a new better healthy 
condition, the this time preventive treatment certainly is the most economical 
procedure, this was the people searches already the long prevention disease 
method. </p>
<p>The curative effect decides all, lets the 
curative effect speak, lets the curative effect decide, lets the curative effect 
choose, the curative effect and the fact are any is any, certainly also needs 
the history to examine. In all medicine system and the culture, the Chinese 
medicine has only experienced several millenniums tests, but continued to 
survive, still retained, simultaneously was has the system to have the system 
the knowledge, is in the present world the best medicine or only may effectively 
prevent and control all diseases the medicine, but was not the deceit or the 
psychological comfort, why good weren't such academic we allowed to inherit and 
to propagate. The Chinese medicine already passed the historical examination, 
the Western medicine had been hopeful, if according to the present situation, 
the like this curative effect, cannot stop the medicine the awkwardness, to 
virus's helpless and medicine serious poisonous side effect! Is indeed very 
difficult the time which endures the historical examination center to need, idle 
talk passed. We do not need the flashy but lacking substance expert theory, does 
not need the fatal toxicant hormone, only looked the fact and the effect, hold 
the mouse then. The patient good was the truth, the patient has been good is a 
science. Time the Chinese medicine is the time which certainly counter-attacks, 
the Chinese medicine has risen the date also is the Chinese culture rises, is 
light of luck of and patient the the 
world common people of. Outlook on life different, ideal different, the goal is 
different, the pursue boundary is not same. Obviously, this on-line hospital 
promotes not only to the Chinese medicine, will have the decisive influence to 
the entire medical system. </p>
<p>Although the Chinese medicine extremely has the 
prospect, but it faced with market stern challenge. The Western medicine has 
already obtained the certain success in the medical market, luckily its clumsy 
curative effect, the bad poisonous side effect, specially in the high end market 
application, for instance the prevention disease, ahead of time diagnoses, 
aspect and so on early treatment, or unusual is primitive and lacks, only was 
starts, even lacks like. Therefore center the medicine now enters this market 
not to calculate too late. Said from academic and the technical angle that, the 
Chinese medicine is other medical systems substitutions and the revolution, for 
instance present popular Western world medicine. But the Chinese medicine must 
withstand the negative influence which a history leaves behind. Because of the 
before education and the propaganda, as well as the Chinese medicine easy to 
learn at first but hard to master, caused some users not to entertain the hope 
to it. However, the Chinese medicine compares its competitor has many reveals 
the superiority. Once the people realized to the Western medicine in the 
diagnosis and the treatment aspect limitation, specially in viral treatment 
aspect helpless and malignant disease misdiagnosing, the Western medicine at 
present the control status which will occupy in the medical system no longer 
exists, the Western medicine the harm which will bring to the patient stop over 
will be after all cans hardly absolve and is unable to push shifts. 
</p>
<p>The health is we to you most sincere blessing. 
Can come this also is the reason share, we hoped you can obtain any in here or 
have profit. The Chinese medicine may relieve the urgent matter for you and be 
worth you trusting, has the outstanding preventing and controlling disease 
function. Idles is all right also may boil drinks, beneficial is harmless, the 
health is the first qualification after all. The Chinese medicine prevention and 
the treatment, safe is more reliable than the Western medicine vaccine, 
simultaneously does not have the viral variation or the antibiotic question, 
also cannot let these causes 
cancer and the fatal matter enters the human body again by way of the 
luxurious feasting.  </p>
<p>The Chinese medicine 
preventing and controlling disease best choice, 64 million
common people's gospels, world medical service 
system tomorrow, will prolong the life way that must be taken! Has chosen the 
Chinese medicine, meaning you have been stepping road of the health. The 
counter- uncut jade returns to original condition, the return nature, the 
treasure loves the life! The balanced heart condition, the improvement psychology, improve the 
quality, the reduced embezzlement, the reduced evil, the reduction is cruel, the 
reduced war, the world peace. The life only a time, the essential choice often 
also only has a time, only has the Chinese medicine to be allowed to let the 
healthy partner as you like life. The western medicine = toxicant is the well 
known matter, is far away the narcotics, resists certainly the narcotics! 
</p>
<p>In this age, the 
Western medicine to the human body health help nearly is zero, therefore the 
modern people extremely need the health, needs to prevent and to treat the 
disease, because they nearly are in the region which close runs its own course, 
everybody from the danger, are in in the Asian health, they urgently need the 
Chinese medicine, needs the non-toxic harmless natural health. With the Western 
medicine most greatly similarity is, the Chinese medicine can pick to any 
disease and the question launches an attack on own initiative the way, 
beforehand prevents, and blocks each kind of possibility the development and 
extends, but must afterwards passively responded. </p>
<p>This on-line hospital disease prevents and 
controls the effect and the research results, possibly is throughout history, 
the predecessor never has seen! The Chinese medicine soon rules the world, rises 
in the international scene, Chinese medicine popularity time coming soon, the 
patients and the government correlation department needs reto adapt and the 
design corresponding system. Convinces the people to accept the main information 
which the Chinese medicine certainly is not we attempts to transmit, we thought 
this is the natural matter. Chinese medicine preventing and controlling disease 
any difficulty, has not been difficult only is the people to the Chinese 
medicine understanding. </p>

	This is the

	<li>When Western
