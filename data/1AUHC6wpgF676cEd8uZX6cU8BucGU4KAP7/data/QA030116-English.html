<ul>
        <li>The Western medical skill examination, the science, the statistical 
		data, many too simple are one-sided, one thing recorded and ten thousand 
		omitted, its theory itself waits for the discussion, cannot accurately 
		express or reflect patient's real present situation;</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Is similar to the cancer must wait till the 
		last stage or the fist big when can discover is same, the physical 
		examination year after year is year after year normal, also did not know 
		is emits from there, this is the modern science standard; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>Whether we may believe like this, each 
		example cancer discovery all is misdiagnoses, the most minimum each 
		example terminal cancer discovery all is misdiagnoses;</li>
      </ul>
        <li>Treats when reaches this point, also only 
		can regularly comes back the inspection, and the not accurate effective 
		treatment plan, only can be tries, the waiting, the waiting final that 
		day-long arrival; </li>
        <li>We did not say so heavy disease, said the 
		heart disease, the very oversensitive internal organs patient is sends 
		even the critically ill time at the heart disease only then knew is the 
		heart disease (otherwise three T experiment is unavoidably); Or the 
		hepatitis, must be needs to treat destroys to the liver cell surpasses 
		50% (before is 70%) only then has the opportunity to discover that, 
		namely this time shape and the nature already had the change, already 
		was too late; </li>
        <li>The naming disorder, does not have the 
		regularity, does not have the substantive instruction significance, is 
		discovered in the different age, tried to find out with gradually forms, 
		therefore as the name suggests for experimental medicine; Even has many 
		is, has created very many nonessential confusions which names with the 
		personal name, this also simultaneously explained the doctor practicing 
		western medicine is unscientific and is not rigorous, as well as 
		contention fame and fortune level;</li>
        <ul>
        <li>If the non- standard (2003-10-14) the year, 
		the diagnosis definition still has until now not been clear, therefore 
		is far from the treatment; </li>
		<li>Misdiagnosing rate reaches as high as 30%, 
difficult case of illness misdiagnosing rate surpasses 40%! Each example cancer, 
the heart disease or the stroke discovered itself is an example misdiagnoses 
(so, misdiagnosing rate certainly is not 40%, but was 80% or 90% question)!
</li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
        <li>The Chinese medicine acts according to four examines, the masculine and 
		feminine elements dialectically five line, the Tibet likely channels and 
		collaterals, not only may distinguish the disease the nature, the weight 
		and the spot, knows patient's present, after but also may infer the 
		patient pre-;</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Merely diagnosis by feeling the pulse 
		obtains the data and the material reach more than 70 items, far compared 
		to stethoscope, even the nuclear magnetic resonance for are many;</li>
        <li>Much less also has observation of patient's complexion, Wen Chen, asks 
		examines, as well as masculine and feminine elements theory, five lines 
		of theories, Tibet likely theory, channels and collaterals theory, with 
		diagnosis and treatment; </li>
        <li>The Chinese medicine diagnosis is discovers 
		the human body to lack any, or many any, namely Sheng Hoshuai, where is 
		not balanced. If diagnoses accurately, to patient's help can just right, 
		like a sweet potato, is hungrier much the time in the person, may rescue 
		a person life; Although sweet potato itself is not worth the money, but 
		equally is saved merit of the life, the value is often more important 
		than the price;</li>
        <ul>
        <li>But this, is precisely the life true meaning; </li>
      </ul>
 
        <li>Names succinctly, its itself is the 
		treatment instruction or the principle. Essentially, the Chinese 
		medicine diagnosis and the treatment are the identical body, is at the 
		same time and has systematically produces; </li>
        <ul>
        <li>If the Chinese medicine simply does not 
		have to pay attention to the non- standard is any, is how produces, acts 
		appropriately to the situation then; </li>
        <li>Or like the stroke, the Chinese medicine 
		does not have to know it is the hemorrhage stroke or lacks the courage 
		and uprightness stroke, is safe quickly, why not, this is in the level 
		difference. </li>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>The Chinese medicine and doctor practicing 
		western medicine's diagnosis is different, cannot the same date say, has 
		to compare or whose diagnosis to be actually correct, looked the 
		curative effect or looks at the survival rate then. </p>
        <p>Certainly, the doctor practicing western 
	medicine therefore the limitation and is one-sided, by no means west mistake 
	of the doctor, but is the entire doctor practicing western medicine system 
	question, most fatal place was has neglected macroscopic, but went to 
	extremes the flowered time to microscopically... ... </p>
    <p>The cancer and the non- standard cause doctor 
practicing western medicine's vulnerability to be completely unmasked, even more 
demonstrates doctor practicing western medicine's collapsing at the first blow.

      <li>Canadian passing society Toronto on May 31, 2002: The Canadian scientists 
		initially appraise the lung cancer gene group, hopes to assist doctor to 
		distinguish as soon as possible the patient accepts the treatment can 
		the result, or extremely possibly again recurs. </li>
        <ul>
        <li>The Canadian contracts in the cancer, the lung cancer lethality is 
		highest, therefore can forecast these patients need to strengthen the 
		treatment to have the great significance. It is estimated that this year 
		some 18,400 people die of the lung cancer, and has 20,800 people to be 
		able to diagnose suffers from the trouble lung cancer.</li>
        <li>University 
		Health Network responsible lung cancer gene group's Dennis Wigle doctor 
		said in the university health care network that, acts appropriately to 
		the situation is on the best plan, how but does the key question 
		distinguish the different patient, this research the Princess Margrret 
		hospital Ontario Cancer Institute carries out by subordination 
		university health care network Marguerite Princess.</li>
        <li>The medical arena presents the early diagnosis and the treatment is an 
		ancient sundial, but many lung cancer were discovered when already was 
		medicine and stone acupuncture needles the invalid stage. More difficult 
		is, some early times the lung cancer which discovered (were called first 
		issue of case of illness) the treatment result is not certainly good, 
		that is some lung cancer situation is bad, is not suitable the early 
		treatment advantageous condition the principle. If has the distinction 
		illness the method, doctor needs to waste the time, rapidly takes the 
		positive remedial measure. </li>
        <li>After the Dennis Wigle and the researcher observe the lung cancer 
		sickness the organization, discovered illness recurring has 22 kind of 
		special genes. They use may the quite massive genes science and 
		technology, filters 19,000 kind of genes to only remains 3,000 kinds, 
		then discovers 22 kind of special objects in among.</li>
        <li>The Dennis Wigle explains that, after entirely different accepts lung 
		cancer patient's gene group which the treatment the situation is good 
		and can recur. The neopathy person's gene if has the same 
		characteristic, we may forecast the situation. But we still need more 
		experiments, could in on clinical apply.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Only is, these work Chinese medicine in several 
millenniums before already completed, and continues to use until now.</p>
<ul>
      <li>2003-3-13 Xinhua News Agency Rome: The 
		Italian medical scientists invent the diagnosis small tumor scanner<ul>
      <li>This kind of new scanner can find out the 
		tumor cell in the short several minutes the type, and helps doctor to
		<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">find the small tumor which these 
		continually X beam inspection and the ultrasonic wave inspection all is 
		unable to discover</span>. This item is called as &quot;Trimprob&quot; the 
		technology, finally will become screens the many kinds of cancer cells, 
		even can diagnose the heart disease and so on other diseases one 
		effective method.</li>
      <li>Scanner inventor Wei dru uneven Austria on 
		13th when accepts the media interview said, he invents this kind of new 
		diagnostic instrumentation <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">can 
		discover slightly to half rice grain big tumor</span>, and makes rapid 
		and the credible diagnosis. It will be helpful to the early diagnosis 
		cancer, saves the patient life.</li>
      <li>Wei dru Qi Ao said that, the new scanner very 
		quickly will go on the market, will die for the reduction to the cancer 
		patient plays the role. According to the Italian media reported, 
		although the scientist has gained many victories in recent years at in 
		the same cancer struggle, but stubborn cancer &quot;fortress&quot; has not been 
		until now broken through. Only European place, the cancer every year 
		seizes the life much reaches 1.6 million people.<ul>
      <li>The editor pours: </li>
      <ul>
      <li>From this time on you whether do have the 
comprehension? Namely why the doctor practicing western medicine did discover 
the cancer all is a later period, because of Before this the doctor practicing 
western medicine to &quot;half rice grain big tumor&quot;, as well as is smaller than 
&quot;half rice grain big tumor&quot; all is turns a blind eye to, certainly must wait 
&quot;the egg big tumor&quot; only then to be startled is the beauty!</li>
      <li>Satirizes, the doctor practicing western medicine 
is by &quot;microscopic&quot; but proud. But doctor practicing western medicine's electron 
microscope as well as what nuclear magnetic resonance and so on why couldn't 
discover these &quot;half rice grain big tumor&quot;? Until today, on March 13, 2003, only 
then earth-shaking discovered - - was allowed to discover &quot;half rice grain big 
tumor&quot;! </li>
      <li>&quot;Half rice grain big tumor&quot; as well as is smaller 
than &quot;half rice grain big tumor&quot; the patient, whether you should consider, can 
hold inhuman?</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    </ul>
      <li>2003-08-13 innovation may examine the early lung cancer<ul>
      <li>Pointed out take the Vancouver as base 
		Genyous Diagnostics, this organization research and development new 
		testing method may in the early inspection lung cancer, thus may greatly 
		increase patient's chance of survival.</li>
      <li>Researcher Branko Palcic doctor said: 
		&quot;extremely early and the partial cancer trouble is machine does not have 
		the injury the disease. You may excise it, the long-term survival rate 
		is quite high, even if is the lung cancer.&quot; Getting sick when first 
		round is discovered the ratio which but can survive to be possible to 
		promote to 95%. </li>
      <li>The lung cancer is a principal factor which 
		the male and female cancer patient dies, because when discovers time, 
		the condition is ordinary worsened is unable to treat. </li>
      <li>If this organization inspection procedure 
		lives an authorization by Canada, most quickly may in 2005 the 
		application.</li>
        <ul>
      <li>The editor pours:</li>
      <ul>
      <li>This to the Chinese medicine said only is the 
	foundation knowledge, early has the system elaboration in the Chinese 
	medicine theory, is already using, the question is the people looks down 
	upon / does not know; </li>
      <li>Simultaneously the Chinese medicine level far 
		is higher than this, may before the forming namely had discovered, so 
		mentions, getting sick is discovered the ratio which but can survive 
		definitely to be able to surpass 95%.</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>
      <li>2003-09-17 Tsuen Wan port peaceful hospital 
		receive suspicion sand men and women patient, makes the entire port to 
		fall into the sand gentleman to be panic once again. The courtyard side 
		successively analyzes, the urination in a big way for the female 
		patient, the result unexpectedly is a masculine negative, &quot;is 
		intermittent&quot;. The health bureau yesterday afternoon card woman with 
		malformed vagina or uterus causing sterility patient and non- infected 
		Sha Shihhou, Tsuen Wan's port peaceful hospital once diagnoses the 
		female patient doctor and the nurse stopped isolating, this courtyard 
		indicated can examine the existing test sand gentleman coronal virus 
		mechanism; </li>
        <ul>
      <li>The port peaceful hospital market department 
		manager yesterday explained that, this courtyard and the non- sand 
		gentleman blood serum test, only can analyze the patient to be big, the 
		urinative sample, delivers to the sample the Hong Kong gene science and 
		technology (HKDNA) to analyze, emphasized the related test method may 
		examine the coronal virus. He said that, can regard as this event the 
		lesson, and the self-criticism emergency measure, again will have in the 
		future suspected Sha Shihke the document, will be able to transfer the 
		public hospital immediately; But if the patient only has part of Sha 
		Shihchih the shape, still could use analyzes, the urinative way in a big 
		way carries on the examination. </li>
        <ul>
      <li>The port peaceful hospital market department 
		manager pointed out, this 34 year old of female patients because have 
		difficulty in breathing to this month tenth and slightly have a fever to 
		this courtyard ask to examine, late two time has not had early the 
		discovery lungs according to X light to appear the difference, the blood 
		test discovered the white blood cell content is high. This month 14th, 
		the female patient after X light right side discovered the lungs have 
		the shadow. </li>
      <li>To the day before yesterday afternoon, 
		analyzed proves woman with malformed vagina or uterus causing sterility 
		in patient's excrement to have the coronal virus, suspected she infected 
		the sand gentleman, the courtyard side then informs the health bureau, 
		in the courtyard medical care personnel and the patient.</li>
    </ul>
      <li>After repeatedly tests, finally confirmed 
		transfers by the Tsuen Wan port peaceful hospital toward Majialie 
		Hospital's female patient infects the sand gentleman by no means, sand 
		gentleman misgivings end, but the event exposes the private hospital to 
		examine Sha Shihke shi Kefa, the accuracy becomes doubts. Once twice 
		experimented vacation masculine raising to Sha Shihts'e to indicate with 
		the hospital that, they did not want to appear the vacation masculine 
		gender to make social false alarm, the criticism government certainly 
		not to assist the private courtyard chemical examination sand gentleman.</li>
        <ul>
      <li>Raises indicated with hospital vice-president 
		that, this courtyard continuously sends a letter Hong Kong government to 
		hope assists to promote the sand gentleman fast to test the technology 
		and the laboratory level, this courtyard is willing to pay the expense, 
		like reequips the laboratory or the training technical personnel, even 
		purchases the fast test reagent to the government or the university, but 
		had not always replied, after seeks help many times, only has the port 
		big microorganism department expert to want today to this courtyard 
		inspection reagent, the laboratory and the technical personnel level.
		</li>
      <li>Kernel Chair An implores the unification 
		test, he thought the government must be the private courtyard &quot;does a 
		work&quot;, in order to avoid nonessential panic occurs again, one is sends 
		the expert to voluntarily to make the fast test the private courtyard to 
		patrol, promotion technical standards, if thought the private courtyard 
		ability voluntarily has not made the test, should the sample which 
		submits for the private courtyard carry on the test, confirmed is 
		infected only then passes along the patient toward the public hospital. 
		He acknowledged, in six, in July period, this courtyard Sha Shih tested 
		once appears two times of false masculine genders, was using the 
		flowered nearly 100,000 Yuan the reagent which purchased from the 
		Germany biotechnology PCR company, extracted the patient nose fluid 
		chemical examination, finally assumed the positive reaction; Another is 
		the fast test reagent which delivers using the inland government 
		presents as a gift, also assumes the positive reaction, but the 
		hereafter delivers two samples the Hong Kong University second chemical 
		examination, the only then confirmation is the false masculine gender. 
		Now the hospital many fast tests method all not after the official 
		clinical test, the accuracy and the sensitivity receives questioned, 
		therefore this courtyard if has the need to be able to use the big blood 
		test, the accuracy reaches as high as most likely. He refers, global and 
		the non- recognition fast test method, each place only can depend upon 
		the experienced chemical examination center to carry on the test, he 
		thought the Hong Kong may concentrate by the health bureau unification 
		processing test. </li>
      <li>Examines the vacation masculine gender 
		regarding the private chemical examination, whether analyzes the 
		standard to have the problem, the health bureau spokesperson indicated, 
		the auxiliary medical service industry administrative bureau is 
		responsible for medical affairs chemical examination specialized 
		supervising and managing, promotes them achieves the standard in the 
		solid service and the personal integrity aspect. </li>
    </ul>
      <li>The Hong Kong University, Chinese university 
		and the personal organization separately develops in view of the sand 
		gentleman coronal virus's fast test method, uses the patient different 
		sample, including the nose cavity fluid, the blood and the feces and 
		urine and so on, respectively has the certain limitation, but middle 
		reaches as high as by the nose cavity fluid and the blood accuracy most 
		likely, sends in the patient sickness to be possible to use three days 
		to a week in, after but the bowel movement sample takes a week the use 
		to be able to test whether contains the coronal virus. </li>
        <ul>
      <li>Port big microorganism department assistant 
		professor yesterday indicated that, this is the development PCR fast 
		test method, extracts patient's nose cavity fluid test, after many 
		improvements, including extracts the viral gene the method, the accuracy 
		becomes by the most third day increases to the present most likely, may 
		send three day sampling in the patient sickness to carry on the test, 
		knew as soon as possible the result and takes the emergency measure. The 
		bowel movement must send a week after the sickness to have more viral 
		quantity, only then is suitable to carries on the test; The urine sample 
		then is most unreliable. But he stressed that, the test accuracy still 
		needed to regard the sample innate nature and technician's level which 
		extracted. </li>
      <li>Center big chemistry pathology department 
		assistant professor indicated, center greatly uses the blood test 
		method, may send later on the week in the patient sickness to draw blood 
		the test, the accuracy reaches most likely, reduces along with the blood 
		in viral quantity, 14th date falls to four tenths two. Using the blood 
		test advantage is may know in the blood the viral density, is easy to 
		compare the patient in vivo virus quantity whether reduces, but 
		temporarily with difficulty knows in the nose fluid the viral quantity.</li>
      <li>He refers, at present between the work place 
		(hospital) uses PCR fast tests all kinds of, the partial accuracies only 
		has two three tenths. The individual hospital chemical examination 
		sample if demonstrated assumes the positive reaction, can give the 
		comparatively large-scale chemical examination, two universities or hand 
		over the health bureau second chemical examination, overlap resources. 
		He is soliciting support the medical department to unify the use test 
		method and the sample, if prevents Sha Shihtsai to erupt, must have 
		early to reach a verdict. </li>
    </ul>
      <li>The Tsuen Wan port peaceful hospital delivers 
		to the Hong Kong gene science and technology (HKDNA) the female patient 
		bowel movement sample tested to Sha Shih assumes the false positive 
		reaction, reporter yesterday wants to contact this company person in 
		charge, understood which test method used and the test accuracy, but the 
		company referred to the person in charge not in the port, was unable to 
		reply the inquiry.</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Some disciple of a master private doctors 
		disclosed, when May Sha Shihi tide near last act, a named HKDNA company 
		started to private doctor to sell the service, middle including the test 
		sand gentleman coronal virus, declared makes the chemical examination 
		the university to be more accurate than, the test mainly is examines the 
		feces and urine and the blood, the charge approximately is 900 to 1,000 
		Yuan. </li>
        <li>Called Beijing also picked the similar 
		method, President HKDNA and administrative President at the beginning of 
		May once indicated to the media, this company studied diagnoses Sha 
		Shih's method immediately, in view of incubation period sickness, so 
		long as the virus entered the human body penetration gene test, might 
		directly examine the viral gene, also whether there is still could test 
		the virus in the sample after the dilution. He declared the Beijing 
		country prevented the non- standard urgent science and technology motion 
		group also utilizes this method, carries on the test to 15 samples, 
		finally demonstrated, its sensitivity is the universal use &quot;counter 
		copies -- gathers the response test&quot; 1,000 times, reaches as high as 
		compared to the immune body test method sensitivity 100,000 times. This 
		company once to the medical department and the health bureau proposed 
		free the document makes the fast test for 1,000 Sha Shihke, but suffers 
		resists certainly.</li>
        <li>According to the material demonstrated 
		that, HKDNA was the Hong Kong attains the gene transformation food test 
		and kisses the child to recognize serves the ISO9002 standard management 
		certificate biotechnology company, three years ago establish, October of 
		the year before last year once succeeded invent &quot;may examine must arise 
		the natural and arising birds and beasts flu armor H5 hypotype virus' 
		wrap&quot;, and obtained the patent. President and administrative President 
		once were appointed Hong Kong scientific and technical university 
		biology department associate professor.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>The processing technique chaotic raises 
		panic, the Hong Kong economy just &quot;the big at the beginning of sickness 
		recovered&quot; actually transmits the sand gentleman misgivings, made all 
		the various trades and occupations unable to restrain to wipe 
		perspiration. Once because the atypical pneumonia has received the heavy 
		losses tourism and the catering business, criticizes the government this 
		processing technique to be improper, causes a residential panic, also 
		has the outside areas newspapers to reveal the length report event, the 
		field was worrying the related news can affect the economical step which 
		recovers, thought the government has the essential unification issue 
		mechanism, should not again appear a specious sand gentleman misgivings 
		document. </li>
        <ul>
      <li>The Tsuen Wan port peaceful hospital day 
		before yesterday the 5 PM of 15 minute received the chemical examination 
		company which voluntarily hired to inform, to refer to patient's 
		excrement sample after the coronal virus to assume the positive 
		reaction, in five and half o'clock notice health bureau, indicated 
		immediately had a suspicion sand gentleman patient, the patient escort 
		to Majialie Hospital to 10 PM of 20 revolutions per minute. The hospital 
		administrative bureau and the health bureau separately ten for a while 
		20 was divided and yesterday morning for a while 12 is divided the 
		confirmation event in the night before last and makes the response, 
		although the port peaceful hospital chemical examination result referred 
		to the patient to have the positive reaction, but the government has not 
		certainly listed as the patient officially &quot;a suspicion document&quot;.
		</li>
      <li>The port peaceful and the government night 
		before last is inconsistent to the patient situation view, yesterday 
		only then confirmed the patient non- infection sand gentleman, the news 
		is so chaotic, has the certain influence to the tourism.</li>
      <li>Is reprimanded is not willing to provide 
		measures the reagent, medical policy advisory council president refers, 
		the government is not willing to provide the fast test reagent to the 
		private hospital, creates this nonessential panic principal factor. He 
		refers to the private courtyard to the personal organization purchase 
		test or the chemical examination service, the innate nature guaranteed 
		with difficulty that, appears the vacation masculine gender not to be 
		also extraordinary. The partial private courtyards for exempt the 
		trouble, only has &quot;is the department all does not transfer&quot; the patient 
		to the public hospital, is easy to create the sand gentleman misgivings. 
		He believed that, the government must explain resists certainly to 
		provide the fast test reagent for the private hospital the reason, 
		suggested the authority may the cost price or the reasonable price 
		provides the reagent to the private courtyard, in order to the private 
		courtyard carries on the preliminary test, after confirmed the patient 
		infects only then transfers the government to process. </li>
    </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In the Tsuen Wan port peaceful hospital 
		receive suspicion sand men and women patient, makes the entire society 
		to fall into newly is panic, the port peaceful hospital resembles the 
		time to flow backwards, the picture returned to the sand gentleman to 
		run amuck the time. But when the courtyard side examines the feces and 
		urine many times for the patient, actually discovered Sha Shih's symptom 
		unexpectedly in plays the hide-and-seek with them, appear and disappear 
		from time to time, finally, the port peaceful hospital still the 
		dependent health bureau made the fast blood serum test, confirmed was 
		only false alarm, but this small undulation, made 6 million residential 
		nervous 24 hours, the heart to jump several hundred million, the 
		litigant is looks like is saved from death, suddenly like again world, 
		even though nobody is killed by the sand gentleman, also is scared to 
		death by the sand gentleman.<ul>
      <li>Because Sha Shih is one kind of new epidemic, 
		the entire port various sizes hospital the understanding which certainly 
		not fully suffices to it, also does not have one kind of unified 
		examination standard, everybody only can various Shi Kefa, examine Sha 
		Shih's coronal virus, the privately established hospital because lacks 
		the blood serum quick test the equipment, only can inspect the saliva 
		and the feces and urine way judgement sand gentleman illness response, 
		its is accurate rate probably only has two to three tenths, but the 
		public hospital blood serum fast test has most likely the accuracy. 
		Although the private hospital continuously relates the government health 
		bureau, inquiry concerned Sha Shih's most effective inspection 
		procedure, but the government aspect continuously makes every effort to 
		keep secret, regards this aspect material does the secret, slowly does 
		not make the answer, makes the privately established hospital completely 
		to be at a loss how to proceed, therefore only then occurred a 
		succession of made the misunderstanding which one knoid whether to laugh 
		or cry. </li>
      <li>Actually, this artificial wolf has come is 
		completely nonessential, it has exposed a question, that is the public 
		medical system selfish departmentalism sets at in our Yu Shashih threat 
		but not to attend to, simultaneously, also reflects this sand gentleman 
		not only is the disaster, also is the man-made disaster, because several 
		hundred human lives prices have not still let the government health 
		bureau change are intelligent, in under the sand gentleman's serious 
		threat, they also must divide the centimeter privately, will adopt 
		ossified the standpoint, the request private hospital suspected the sand 
		gentleman patient will deliver the public hospital diagnosis, if because 
		of government health bureau bureaucrat manner, Has delayed Sha Shih's 
		guard opportunity, depth of the its disaster, really is not inferior has 
		a mind to set at the person to the deathtrap.</li>

or what doctor practicing western medicine's expert does gather round the non-

not brag the expert at least, could not govern cannot guard against is not the 
expert, or like seized the fish expert. </p>
<p>Such many patients are delayed the diagnosis, has 
not been able promptly to discover and the effective treatment, dies a violent 
death, cherishes hatred the netherworld, also deserves what crime, who should be

listens to (to ask the way to the blind person, the analogy seeks for advice to 
the ignorant person. Borrows the deaf person's ear to listen, the analogy 
strives for to have gained nothing inhuman). Some patients accept the Chinese 
medicine treatment, actually uses doctor practicing western medicine's diagnosis 
to observe the curative effect, this itself is not correct, because doctor 
practicing western medicine's diagnosis until now still was not mature, liked 
doctor practicing western medicine's treatment to be not maturely same. 
Simultaneously in the logic has the error and the contradiction, since the 
doctor practicing western medicine is unable to treat, you counted on the doctor 
practicing western medicine may diagnose, or you believe doctor practicing 
western medicine's diagnosis (although very many people all so mistake, 
including traditional Chinese doctor down to Chinese medicine doctor, Chinese 
medicine professor)! In fact, the doctor practicing western medicine had the 
means to diagnose cannot have the such many terminal cancer, the cancer meant 
misdiagnosed, the cancer = later period (namely later period had been only then 
discovered, moreover very were many is patient discovers). </p>

to examine, doctor actually requests patient to teach). </p>
