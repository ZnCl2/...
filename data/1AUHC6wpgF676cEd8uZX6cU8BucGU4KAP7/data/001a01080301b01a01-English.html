<p>The soup 
therapy involves several important details. These details are to be followed 
very strictly in order for the cure to take effect much faster and more 
effectively. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The prescription has an expiry 
	date. Taking the medication should not exceed the date of expiry. This 
	means that all the ingredients have to be bought as soon as possible and 
	preparation of the soup should not take long. Taking the medication after it 
	has expired will not produce any healing effects.</li>
	<li>Taking the medication follows 
	a strict time schedule.</li>
	<ul>
		<li>For example: If the 
		schedule is from 8:00 to 10:00 – This should be taken at exactly “8:01 
		to 8:03” to get 100% potency. Should this be taken at “8:04 to 10:00”, 
		30% of the potency will be gone. Taking the medication over and beyond 
	  the set schedule is not effective.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<li>The medication should be taken 
	twice a day (as per schedule). There are 3 sets of time schedules to follow, 
  choose two schedules only.</li>
	<li>In preparing the medication, 
	the ingredients must be counted precisely. Note that an excess of “one” seed 
	or a miscount in the ingredient can dramatically change the effect of the 
  potency of the medication. </li>
	<li>Ideally, the patient should be 
	the one preparing his/her medication. Our patients can do this on their own 
	on the premise that they should be closely monitored by a sighted person. 
	However, it is very difficult for one person to monitor all five patients at 
	the same time. We advice that the preparation of the medication shall be 
	done individually in the beginning to avoid confusion or miscounts on the 
	part of the person monitoring and assisting the blind patient. Thus, one 
	patient should be instructed on how to prepare his/her medication on a 
	one-on-one basis initially until such time when all the five patients can 
  comfortably prepare their own medication with minimal supervision.</li>
	<li>Since one prescription is good 
	for three days, preparation of the medication should be the same. 
	<ul>
		<li>Prepare three separately 
	  bowls with labels showing the patient’s name to avoid confusion.</li>
		<li>Carefully count the 
		ingredients one by one and put them inside the bowl. (Note: The bowl 
		must be made only of ceramics. Plastics and metals cause damage to the 
	  medication due to its chemical components.</li>
		<li>As soon as the ingredients 
		are completed, fill the bowls with water (make sure that the bowl is 
	  filled three inches above the ingredients).</li>
		<li>Boil the medication for at 
		least 10 minutes. Do not worry if the water level goes down. Make sure 
		that the ingredients, such as seeds, have opened or softened. Cover the 
	  bowls while boiling.</li>
		<li>Do not taste or put a 
	  finger on the soup. This will take away the potency of the medication.</li>
		<li>Upon boiling, store the 
	  preparations inside a refrigerator.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>When taking the medication, 
	strictly follow the instructions. There are different ways in taking the 
	soup (cold, mild and hot takes). Cold take means that the medication should 
	be taken after coming from the refrigerator.&nbsp; Mild take means that the 
	medication should be under room temperature. (For mild takes, take the 
	medication out of the refrigerator 10 to 20 minutes before taking.) Hot take 
	means that the medication is considerably hot to swallow, but not boiling 
  and can burn the tongue.</li>
	<li>Preparing and taking the 
	medication should be done diligently and precisely. Note that a single 
	mistake such as a miscount can affect the healing process. An expired soup 
	must be thrown away. A soup that was tasted or touched before its schedule 
	of take will produce no healing effect even if it was the patient himself 
	who tasted or touched it. Detailed instructions must be followed very 
  carefully and strict monitoring should be practiced.</li>
	<li>Blind patients who are 
	eligible to take the medication are those who can still sense a faint amount 
	of light (such as the case of Mr. Hermie Alberto). There should be a strong 
	determination of the patient to be healed and the willingness to undergo the 
	treatment with the belief that his/her own body is creating the energy to 
	cure the damaged area of his/her own body. Patients must be focused on 
  healing themselves.</li>
	<li>The patients must not make fun 
	or ridicule the medication because this causes negative energies within 
	their own bodies and can produce no healing effects for them. The medication 
  and the process must be taken seriously.</li>
	<li>Always remember that the 
	medication balances the energies of the body in order for the body to heal 
	its damaged areas. Thus, it is not only the vision that is being healed but 
	the entire body is being strengthened to heal the cause of its visual 
  impairment.</li>
</ul>
