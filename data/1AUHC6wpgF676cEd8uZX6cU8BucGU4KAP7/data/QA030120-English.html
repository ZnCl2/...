<ul>
  <li>Does not use the clean raw material for 
	medicine, if certain raw materials for medicine moisten have the dust, might 
	as well the water used slightly for flushes;</li>
  <li>Front decocts medicinal herbs, but the water 
	used soaks the raw material for medicine approximately for half hour;</li>
    <ul>
    <li>The water wants the immerse raw material for 
	medicine, lets the raw material for medicine fully take up water, boils the 
	taste of a medicine;</li>
    <li>Soaks the medicine to have to use the cold 
	water, makes the raw material for medicine and the water uniform 
	temperature, the moisture content is easy to seep, advantageous raw material 
	for medicine release effective component; </li>
    <li>If uses the hot water, the partial traditional 
	Chinese medicines matter possibly can have the denaturation, the active 
	principle could not dissolve. For example the Poris cocos, fox, raw material 
	for medicine and so on malt, Chinese yam, includes the starch, if soaks with 
	the hot water fries again, can cause in the medicine the starch to congeal, 
	affects the drug efficacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>When decocts medicinal herbs, has flooded 
	approximately two inches, first uses the high heat (fire), Shui Feihou uses 
	the soft fire again (flame), maintains in micro boils the condition; </li>
    <ul>
  <li>Probably fries for a hour, how much regards the 
	raw material for medicine to decide; </li>
  <li>Not the suitable frequency operates the pot 
	cover, like fries sticks, fries burnt should abandon it, therefore time 
	property of a medicine is possible to change (for example the nutritious 
	codonopsis pilosula, the Chinese yam, ripely and so on, contains the sugar, 
	the amino acid can destroy, the drug efficacy greatly reduces. Also like 
	nepeta japonica, peppermint, lophantusrugosus and so on sparse wind 
	diaphoretic, once fries burnt, its volatile special characteristic then can 
	lose, even possibly has the opposite function); </li>
</ul>
  <li>After some medicines want under, because these 
	raw material for medicine volatilities are specially strong, like thin lotus 
	leaf, perilla leaves, Chinese cassia tree and hemp yellow and so on: </li>
    <ul>
    <li>If fries the time excessively is long, the 
	active principle easily evaporates along with the water, loses actually the 
	drug efficacy; </li>
    <li>Therefore, when the medicine almost fries, 
	after only then adds on the under raw material for medicine, again decoction 
	many two minutes then may; </li>
  </ul>
  <li>At the same time the medicine curative effect can 
	receive the suffering medicine thought to affect, therefore the suggestion 
	decocts medicinal herbs by the children; </li>
    <ul>
  <li>This is, in you which the traditional culture is 
	in sole possession of is unable to understand, might as well looked is one 
	kind of filial piety then; </li>
  <li>Spends very few to you; </li>
  <li>Was generally known in the future these 
	traditional culture by the people, you also may just to console oneself, not 
	be able at least always sense some any is short of; </li>
</ul>
  <li>Did not approve the use &quot;the single taste 
	Chinese native medicine tablets ready for decoction namely dissolves the 
	pellet&quot;, namely directly withdraws the single taste Chinese native medicine, 
	concentrates extract, the retreatment becomes a granule, finally 
	concentrates Cheng Chengt'ieh the Chinese native medicine; This dispensing 
	way although simple is easy, basically has realized the Chinese native 
	medicine dispensing automation, but also has some significant flaws: </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Cannot realize the precise quota by the 
	packaging machine quota seal small bag Chinese native medicine, creates the 
	error said regarding the highly enriched Chinese native medicine pellet, is 
	does not permit;</li>
    <li>Becomes the weight which the bag Chinese native 
	medicine combines to be limited, is unable to satisfy the traditional 
	Chinese medicine theory request which extremely is fastidious about to the 
	Chinese native medicine amount used (to count technique aspect in particular 
	request); </li>
    <li>The single taste Chinese native medicine 
	mutually between by no means has the extremely important chemical reaction, 
	but this to Chinese medicine curative effect obtaining with the influence is 
	extremely important; </li>
    <li>One kind of Chinese native medicine includes 
		the chemical composition possibly surpasses 100 kinds, the chemical 
		composition which the compound prescription Chinese native medicine 
		preparation includes possibly can achieve several hundred kinds, even 
		nearly thousand kinds; </li>
        <ul>
    <li>The Chinese native medicine contains chemical 
		composition many and complex, between them can the chemical reaction be 
		more numerous and diverse?</li>
      <li>More importantly this person whether or not 
		completely will withdraw, how but did he know will be completely 
		withdraws?</li>
        <ul>
      <li>Really is does not have the omission? What 
		hasn't omitted?</li>
      <li>Minimum Doctor A and Doctor B needs some 
		ingredient he has withdrawn? </li>
        <ul>
      <li>As far as I know, 100% withdraws is not 
		impossible; </li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
      <li>Whether contains the medicine the effective 
		component, becomes the proportion to withdraw? Can otherwise attend to 
		one thing without losing track of another thing?</li>
      <li>Withdraws what in the process whether or not 
		creates any / to it to harm or the decomposition destruction?</li>
      <li>How does the medicine direct to process? 
		After first boils under, after how first comes to arrive? </li>
        <ul>
    <li>Because certain medicines already were very 
		early fry ripely! Is not fresh, is not the first suffering!</li>
    <li>Liked hundred boiling soup (to seethe with 
		excitement 100 time / has water which 100 froth emits), with the water 
		which just seethed with excitement is different!</li>
    <li>Freshly just boiled the good gruel, before 
		it's too late ate was the healthy tendency restores vital energy; And so 
		on put cool has eaten perhaps again has overnight eaten, was cold, old 
		person getting sick is not suitable;</li>
    <li>Boils by who, is who suffering, then is 
		different; </li>
  </ul>
  </ul>

    <li>Provides this item of national monopolist, 
		believed is the layman;</li>
        <ul>
    <li>Or this item of national monopoly certainly 
		did not express this method feasibility, only is a new thing, is one 
		kind of business dealing;</li>
    <li>All use three big conventions, the stethoscope, 
	the sphygmomanometer and the nuclear magnetic resonance in the traditional 
	Chinese medicine college and the Chinese medicine hospital, with the urine 
	day white content, in the hemoglobin, the blood sugar, the blood pressure as 
	well as the blood contains the height which the bacterium virus counts, the 
	weight Chinese medicine treatment result age; </li>
    <ul>
    <li>In doctor practicing western medicine professor 
	Chinese medicine, center medical doctor practicing western medicine's idea, 
	viewpoint, request standard age;</li>
    <li>Inspects, the management, the control Chinese 
	medicine in the doctor practicing western medicine (even in medical record, 
	diagnosis, prescription) the age, this is may understand;</li>
  </ul>
  </ul>
  </ul>
