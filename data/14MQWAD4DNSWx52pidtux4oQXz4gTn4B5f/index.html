  <p>Noriko Arai is the program director of an AI challenge, Todai Robot
 Project, which asks the question: Can AI get into the University of 
Tokyo? The project aims to visualize both the possibilities and the 
limitation of current AI by setting a concrete goal: a software system 
that can pass university entrance exams. In 2015 and 2016, Todai Robot 
achieved top 20 percent in the exams, and passed more than 60 percent of
 the universities in Japan.</p>The inventor of Reading Skill Test, in 
2017 Arai conducted a large-scale survey on reading skills of high and 
junior high school students with Japan's Ministry of Education. The 
results revealed that more than half of junior high school students fail
 to comprehend sentences sampled from their textbooks. Arai founded the 
Research Institute of Science for Education to elucidate why so many 
students fail to read and how she can support them.&nbsp;

mostly through captive work. In Wamba, a most remote jungle location, I 
have observed unique aspects of bonobo lives (from imaginary play and 
laughter to inter-group encounters to accidents and death) that 
challenge and illuminate our understanding of human evolution. I aim to 
link the play of adult bonobos to insights on human laughter, joy, 
creativity and our capacity for wonder and exploration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    Ingrid Betancourt was a presidential candidate in Colombia in 2002 
when she was kidnapped by guerilla rebels. After six years in captivity 
and a high-profile rescue, she now writes about what she learned about 
fear, forgiveness and the divine.
  </div>

  <p>In 2002, the Colombian rural guerilla movement known as the FARC 
(Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) kidnapped Ingrid Betancourt in 
the middle of her presidential campaign. For the next six years, 
Betancourt was held hostage in jungle prison camps where she was ravaged
 by malaria, fleas, hunger, and human cruelty until her high-profile 
rescue by the Colombian government in 2008.   </p><p>But Betancourt's 
captivity did not diminish her sensitivity to the world. Since her 
release, the would-be president has become a memoirist and fiction 
writer. Her first book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Even-Silence-Has-End-Captivity/dp/1594202656" target="_blank"><em>Even Silence Has Its End</em></a>,
 which lyrically recounts her six years in the impenetrable jungle, was 
published in 2010. In 2016, she published a second work -- this time of 
fiction -- called <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Line-Novel-Ingrid-Betancourt/dp/1594206589" target="_blank">The Blue Line</a>,</em> about the disappearances in Argentina during the Dirty War from 1976 to 1983.   </p><p>Betancourt
 has received multiple international awards for her commitment to 
democratic values, freedom and tolerance, including the French National 
Order of the Légion d’Honneur, the Spanish Prince of Asturias Prize of 
Concord, and the Italian Prize Grinzane Cavour. She remains a vocal 
proponent of peace negotiations between the Colombian government and the
 FARC.</p>

    With his "Microsculpture" series, Levon Biss photographs the incredible details of insects.
  </div>

  <p>Levon Biss is a British photographer who works across many genres, 
including reportage, sport and portraiture. His passion for nature and 
photography have come together to create <a href="http://microsculpture.net/" target="_blank"><em>Microsculpture</em></a>.
 For the project, a unique photographic process composites thousands of 
images using multiple lighting setups to create the final insect 
portraits. Each specimen was mounted on an adapted microscope stage, 
allowing close control over the position of the specimen in front of the
 camera lens. Most insects were photographed in about 30 sections, each 
section lit differently with strobe lights to accentuate the 
microsculpture of that particular area of the body. Each insect portrait
 is created from more than 8,000 separate images. In between his insect 
projects, Biss continues to photograph humans.</p>

    Elizabeth Blackburn won a Nobel Prize for her pioneering work on 
telomeres and telomerase, which may play central roles in how we age.
  </div>

  <p>Dr. Blackburn is the president of the Salk Institute and a pioneering molecular biologist. She received the <a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/blackburn-facts.html" target="_blank">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a>
 in 2009 for discovering the molecular nature of telomeres, the ends of 
chromosomes that serve as protective caps essential for preserving 
genetic information, and for co-discovering telomerase, an enzyme that 
maintains telomere ends. Both telomeres and telomerase are thought to 
play central roles in aging and diseases such as cancer, and her work 
helped launch entire new fields of research in these areas.</p>  <p>In 
addition to the Nobel Prize, Blackburn has received nearly every major 
scientific award including the Lasker, Gruber, and Gairdner prizes. She 
has served as president of the American Association of Cancer Research 
and the American Society for Cell Biology, and on editorial boards of 
scientific journals including <em>Cell</em> and <em>Science</em>. She coauthored the best-selling book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455587974/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1455587974&amp;linkId=0313b6c094afde9823f4a6a36a40dc24" target="_blank"><em>The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer.</em></a> </p>

    David Brenner sees the good and the bad sides of radiation for 
health care, and his goal is to optimize radiation for situations where 
the benefits can be large and the risks small.
  </div>

  <p>Radiation is very much a two-edged sword -- used in the right way 
it has revolutionized modern medicine -- such as through CT scans and as
 a cure for many cancers. But radiation used in the wrong way can be 
harmful. To maximize the benefits of the many different types of 
radiation, we need to understand exactly how they affect us -- from our 
DNA to the whole person.</p>  <p>Brenner directs the Center for 
Radiological Research at Columbia University Medical Center. He started 
his career in theoretical physics --applying quantum mechanics to 
radiation therapy. While he has no doubt forgotten everything he knew 
about quantum mechanics, he has retained his love for applying hard-core
 physics concepts to solve biological problems. David has designed new 
“patient friendly” approaches for prostate cancer radiation therapy that
 are now in common use worldwide, and he is currently very excited about
 the prospects of beating pancreatic cancer with new types of radiation.</p>  <p>Over
 the past 6 years, Brenner has also been working towards a safe way to 
kill drug-resistant bacteria such as MRSA, as well as airborne viruses 
such as influenza, using a unique type of ultra-violet light.</p>

    Through his writing and his realized projects, Peter Calthorpe has 
spread the vision of New Urbanism, a framework for creating sustainable,
 human-scaled places.
  </div>

  Peter Calthorpe’s 30-year design practice is informed by the idea that
 successful places -- whether neighborhoods, towns, urban districts or 
metropolitan regions -- must be diverse in uses and users, must be 
scaled to the pedestrian and human interaction, and must be 
environmentally sustainable.<br><br>In the early 1990s he developed the concept of Transit Oriented Development (described in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1878271687/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1878271687&amp;linkId=2a0bdca7f8f1661c9c882e9ee6f5116a" target="_blank"><em>The Next American Metropolis: Ecology, Community and the American Dream</em></a>) -- an idea that is now the foundation of many regional policies and city plans around the world. His 2010 book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159726721X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=159726721X&amp;linkId=9b594d44f109206d925b71644a1899c8" target="_blank"><em>Urbanism in the Age of Climate Change</em></a>.
 Calthorpe Associates' work in Europe, Asia and the Middle East has 
demonstrated that community design with a focus on sustainability and 
scale can be adapted throughout the globe. His current work throughout 
China is focused on developing standards and examples of Low Carbon 
Cities in Beijing, Chongqing, Kunming, Zhuhai, Jinan and other major 
cities. <br><br>

  <p>Dalio started Bridgewater out of his two-bedroom apartment in New 
York City in 1975 and has grown it into the fifth most important private
 company in the U.S. (according to <em>Fortune</em> magazine). Because 
of the firm’s many industry-changing innovations over its 40-year 
history, he has been called the “Steve Jobs of investing” by <em>aiCIO</em> magazine and named one of <em>TIME</em> magazine’s "100 Most Influential People."</p>Dalio
 attributes Bridgewater’s success to its unique culture. He describes it
 as “a believability-weighted idea meritocracy” in which the people 
strive for “meaningful work and meaningful relationships through radical
 truth and radical transparency.” He has explained this approach in his 
book <a href="https://www.principles.com/" target="_blank"><em>Principles</em></a>, which has been downloaded more than three million times and has produced considerable curiosity and controversy.<p>&nbsp;</p>

    Jorge Drexler is a musician and the first Uruguayan to win an Oscar.
 His music plays with genre and influence, combining subtle harmonies 
and regional styles with electronic effects.
  </div>

  <p>Jorge Drexler doesn't lay claim to one identity over another. Born 
to a German-Jewish exile, Drexler grew up between Uruguay and Israel, 
traveled widely across Latin America, and eventually settled in Spain. 
Within his music, you can hear touches of milonga and bossa nova and 
even Bach, as his lyrics wrangle with notions of nationality and 
belonging, language, identity and love.</p>  <p>Like both of his 
parents, Drexler started his career as a physician, but at the age of 
30, he decided to pursue music full-time. The release of his fifth 
album, Frontera, caught the attention of Brazilian director Walter 
Salles, who tapped him to write the closing song for the 2004 film <em>Motorcycle Diaries</em>.
 Titled "Al Otro Lado del Río" (The Other Side of the River), the song 
won Drexler an Academy Award for Best Original Song and propelled him 
into the international spotlight.</p>  <p>Over the course of his 25-year
 career, Jorge Drexler has produced 12 albums, received 15 Latin Grammy 
nomination (with two wins in 2014 Record of the Year and Best 
Singer-Songwriter Album), four US Grammy nominations, 5 ASCAP Latin 
Awards, and one Academy Award. He has also collaborated with musicians 
from Shakira to Mercedes Sosa to Neneh Cherry and Jovanotti.</p>

  <p>Emily Esfahani Smith is the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553419994/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0553419994&amp;linkId=120a7e5745cd67954ae77f6d0a42e72b" target="_blank"><em>The Power of Meaning: Crafting a Life That Matters</em></a>,
 a book that explores what "meaning" means. She says: "In recent 
decades, there's been a rising tide of alienation, drift, boredom and 
depression throughout society. To be psychologically and spiritually 
healthy, we need to believe that our lives matter. We all need to 
discover ways to feel connected to something larger than ourselves -- to
 feel that our lives make sense. Fortunately, the search for meaning 
doesn’t require some grand or esoteric pursuit, as many people think. 
The untapped sources of meaning are all around us -- right here, right 
now."</p>  <p>Smith draws on psychology, philosophy and literature to 
write about the human experience—why we are the way we are and how we 
can find grace and meaning in a world that is full of suffering. Her 
writing has appeared in the <em>Wall Street Journal, New York Times and The Atlantic</em>. She is also a columnist for <em>The New Criterion</em>,
 as well as an editor at the Stanford University's Hoover Institution, 
where she manages the Ben Franklin Circles project, a collaboration with
 the 92nd Street Y and Citizen University to build meaning in local 
communities.</p>

 chatter in Silicon Valley may have propelled his book to bestselling 
success, but Ferriss himself takes a fervid stance against the 
distractions of technology toys that promote unnecessary multitasking.

    Katherine Freese has been working to identify the dark matter and 
dark energy that permeate the universe -- and to build a successful 
model for the early universe immediately after the Big Bang.
  </div>

  <p>Katherine Freese works in theoretical cosmology, at the interface 
of astrophysics and particle physics. This field has seen remarkable 
successes in the past decade, yet many questions remain, including: What
 is the universe made of? What is the dark matter? What is the dark 
energy? What makes the universe accelerate, both now and during an early
 period of inflation? Freese's research seeks to address these 
questions.</p><p>Freese is investigating the nature of the dark matter, 
the primary (unknown) constituent of the mass in galaxies. As part of 
this work, she recently discovered a new early phase of stellar 
evolution: Dark matter annihilation in the first stars gives rise to a 
heat source that overpowers all cooling mechanisms, preventing the 
further collapse of the stars. She is author of the 2014 book <em>The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter.</em></p>

    Gabriela González is part of the collaboration of more than 1,000 
scientists who measured for the first time the gravitational waves that 
Einstein predicted over 100 years ago. 
  </div>

  <p>Over 100 years after Albert Einstein predicted gravitational waves 
-- ripples in space-time caused by violent cosmic collision, like the 
merging of two black holes -- the LIGO Scientific Collaboration 
confirmed their existence using large, hyper-sensitive detectors in 
different parts of the world. As LIGO's former spokesperson and the 
person responsible for the collaboration of 90 international scientific 
institutions that the project entailed, Argentine astrophysicist 
Gabriela González announced the extraordinary discovery to the world in 
2016. </p>  <p>A relentless curiosity about the universe led González to
 astrophysics as a teenager. Over the course of her 25-year career, she 
has advanced the field of gravitational wave detection, working on both 
improving the sensitivity of interferometers and data analysis. She is 
the recipient of the E. Bouchet and the Jesse W. Beams awards from the 
American Physical Society, the B. Rossi prize from the American 
Astronomical Society, and the 2016 Scientific Discovery Award from the 
US National Academy of Sciences. She was the first woman to receive a 
full professorship in the physics department at Louisiana State 
University.</p>

 Robin Hanson re-imagines humanity's role as our tech becomes smarter. A
 pioneer in prediction markets, also known as information markets and 
idea futures, Hanson has been known since the 1980s for taking the very 
very long view on topics as varied as (a selected list) spatial product 
competition, health incentive contracts, group insurance, product bans, 
evolutionary psychology and bioethics of health care, voter information 
incentives, incentives to fake expertise, Bayesian classification, 
agreeing to disagree, self-deception in disagreement, probability 
elicitation, wiretaps, image reconstruction, the history of science 
prizes, reversible computation, the origin of life, the survival of 
humanity, very long term economic growth, growth given machine 
intelligence, and interstellar colonization.</p><p>Meanwhile, he has 
developed new technologies for conditional, combinatorial, and 
intermediated trading, and studied insider trading, manipulation and 
other foul play. Hanson is associate professor of economics at George 
Mason University, and a research associate at the Future of Humanity 
Institute of Oxford University. His next book is <a href="http://elephantinthebrain.com/" target="_blank"><em>The Elephant in the Brain</em></a>, co-authored with Kevin Simler, due in 2018.</p>

  Before she became an architect, a visit to a small village in 
Bangladesh immediately hooked Anna Heringer on an ancient and yet 
neglected building material -- earth. With its easy availability, 
durability and endless recyclability, she realized, there was a reason 
its use has persisted for thousands of years.<br><br>Since then, 
Heringer’s love affair with sustainable materials has deepened, 
resulting in acclaimed projects like woven bamboo hostels in China and 
the METI Handmade School in Rudrapur, where, along with local workers 
and schoolchildren, she created a building that drew on locally abundant
 materials and fostered modern, sustainable building skills in local 
craftsmen. In the 2014 book,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/reBuilding-Future-Education-Sustainable-architectures/dp/2390332153/" target="_blank"><em>The Future of Architecture</em></a>, she and her coauthors argue for a future that is low-impact and adaptable.

  with Jon Ardern, inspired by influences as far-flung as avant-garde 
architecture and Andrei Tarkovsky. The challenges Jain explores are some

methods and commons that can enable us to mitigate the shock of food 
insecurity and climate change. Recently they produced a series of 
civilian drones, and created a vision of a near-future city where these 
intelligent machines begin to display increasing autonomy with civic 
society. Among Superflux’s previous projects is a headset allowing blind
 subjects injected with a light-sensitive virus to develop a kind of 
“super-sight” sensitive to spectrums that ordinary vision cannot detect.</p>

    Titus Kaphar's artworks interact with the history of art by appropriating its styles and mediums.
  </div>

  <p>As Titus Kaphar says of his work: “I’ve always been fascinated by 
history: art history, American history, world history, individual 
history -- how history is written, recorded, distorted, exploited, 
reimagined, and understood. In my work I explore the materiality of 
reconstructive history. I paint and I sculpt, often borrowing from the 
historical canon, and then alter the work in some way. I cut, crumple, 
shroud, shred, stitch, tar, twist, bind, erase, break, tear, and turn 
the paintings and sculptures I create, reconfiguring them into works 
that nod to hidden narratives and begin to reveal unspoken truths about 
the nature of history."</p> <p>His latest works are an investigation 
into the highest and lowest forms of recording history. From monuments 
to mug shots, this body of work exhibited at Jack Shainman gallery 
December-January 2017 seeks to collapse the line of American history to 
inhabit a fixed point in the present. Historical portraiture, mug shots,
 and YouTube stills challenge viewers to consider how we document the 
past, and what we have erased. Rather than explore guilt or innocence, 
Kaphar engages the narratives of individuals and how we as a society 
manage and define them over time. As a whole, this exhibition explores 
the power of rewritten histories to question the presumption of 
innocence and the mythology of the heroic.</p>

    Garry Kasparov is esteemed by many as the greatest chess player of 
all time. Now he’s engaged in a game with far higher stakes: the 
preservation of democracy.

  <p>When 22-year-old Garry Kasparov became the world’s youngest chess 
Grand Champion, few could predict his turbulent career in chess or as a 
dissident. His chessboard wizardry was already the stuff of legend when,
 in 1997, he made headlines when he lost a rematch to IBM’s Deep Blue 
supercomputer, ushering AI into the public sphere.</p><p>Kasparov’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1610397193/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1610397193&amp;linkId=9d58bcf78cba198f0835904612a17427" target="_blank"><em>Winter Is Coming</em></a>
 details the rise of Putin’s Russia as well as Kasparov’s persecution 
and self-exile, and it serves chilling warnings of reactionary forces 
gathering in the West. He is the chair of the Human Rights Foundation,

    Jim Yong Kim is leading the World Bank Group in the global effort to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity.
  </div>

  <p>Jim Yong Kim is the 12th president of the World Bank Group. Soon 
after he assumed his position in July 2012, the organization established
 two goals to guide its work: to end extreme poverty by 2030; and to 
boost shared prosperity, focusing on the bottom 40 percent of the 
population in developing countries. In September 2016, the World Bank 
Group Board unanimously reappointed Kim to a second five-year term as 
president.</p>  <p>During his first term, the World Bank Group supported
 the development priorities of countries at levels never seen outside a 
financial crisis and, with its partners, achieved two successive, record
 replenishments of the World Bank Group’s fund for the poorest. The 
institution also launched several innovative financial instruments, 
including facilities to address infrastructure needs, prevent pandemics 
and help the millions of people forcibly displaced from their homes by 
climate shocks, conflict, and violence.</p>  <p>Kim’s career has 
revolved around health, education and delivering services to the poor. 
In 1987, Kim co-founded Partners In Health, a nonprofit medical 
organization that works in poor communities on four continents. He has 
received a MacArthur “genius” grant, was recognized as one of America’s 
“25 Best Leaders” by U.S. News &amp; World Report and was named one of 
TIME magazine’s “100 Most Influential People in the World.”</p>

 a draft code of conduct for geoengineering. It calls for geoengineering

decision-making and for disclosure of research and open publication of 
results. He is involved in developing <a href="http://www.origenpower.com/" target="_blank">a process</a> that uses natural gas to generate electricity in a way that removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.    </p>

former alcoholic, Lamott uses humor to weave through loss, parenthood, 
faith and the cancer diagnosis given to her best friend, in beloved 
books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bird-Some-Instructions-Writing-Life/dp/0385480016/" target="_blank"><em>Bird by Bird</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Help-Thanks-Wow-Essential-Prayers/dp/1594631298" target="_blank"><em>Help, Thanks, Wow: The Three Essential Prayers</em></a>
 . She says, “Hope begins in the dark ... if you just show up and try to
 do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: 
you don't give up.” <br><br>Her next book, <em>Hallelujah Anyway; Rediscovering Mercy,</em> is set to release in April 2017.

    A billion people around the world lack access to health care because
 they live too far from a clinic. Through Last Mile Health, 2017 TED 
Prize winner Raj Panjabi aims to extend health services to all -- by 
training members of the community.
  </div>

  <p>Raj Panjabi was nine years old when civil war broke out in his 
native country of Liberia. His family fled, eventually resettling in 
High Point, North Carolina. Raj dreamed of going to medical school and, 
as a student in 2005, he returned to Liberia. He was shocked to find a 
health care system in total devastation. Only 50 doctors remained to 
treat a population of four million.</p><p>With a small team of Liberian 
civil war survivors, American health workers and $6,000 he'd received as
 a wedding gift, Panjabi co-founded&nbsp;<a href="http://lastmilehealth.org/" target="_blank">Last Mile Health</a>&nbsp;in
 2007. Initially focused on care for HIV patients, Last Mile Health has 
grown into a robust organization that partners with the government of 
Liberia to recruit, train, equip and employ community health care 
workers who provide a wide range of services to their neighbors in 
Liberia's most remote regions. In 2016, Last Mile Health workers treated
 50,000 patients, including nearly 22,000 cases of malaria, pneumonia 
and diarrhea in children. While the organization focuses on integrated 
primary care, its network can be leveraged in a crisis. In the fight 
against Ebola, Last Mile Health supported government response by 
training 1,300 health workers in southeastern Liberia.</p><p>Panjabi&nbsp;is
 a physician in the Division of Global Health Equity at Harvard Medical 
School, Brigham and Women's Hospital and an advisor to the Clinton 
Global Initiative. He was ranked as one of "The World’s 50 Greatest 
Leaders"&nbsp;by <em>Fortune</em> in 2015 and named to <em>TIME</em>'s list of the "100 Most Influential People in the World"&nbsp;in 2016. As the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ted.com/participate/ted-prize/prize-winning-wishes/raj-panjabi" target="_blank">winner of the 2017 TED Prize</a>, he has a bold wish to take his work even further.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Whether it’s the long trek between high school classes or the

    Susan Pinker reveals how in-person social interactions are not only 
necessary for human happiness but also could be a key to health and 
longevity.
  </div>

  <p>In her award-winning book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Paradox-Extreme-Gifted-Gender/dp/0679314156/" target="_blank"><em>The Sexual Paradox</em></a>,
 Susan Pinker argued that biological differences could play an 
unexpectedly large role in creating the workplace gender gap. With <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Village-Effect-Face-Face-Healthier/dp/0307359549/" target="_blank"><em>The Village Effect</em></a>,
 she tracks another current: how social, face-to-face interactions are 
critical for the survival of our species, and how technology is 
isolating us from these life-saving bonds. As she writes: "Neglecting to
 keep in close contact with people who are important to you is at least 
as dangerous to your health as a pack-­a-­day cigarette habit, 
hypertension or obesity."</p><p>  In addition to her books, Pinker writes Mind and Matter, a column for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>
 illuminating surprising advances in human behavior research. Pinker’s 
numerous writings (including her weekly columns "Problem Solving" and 
"The Business Brain") have appeared in the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Financial Times</em>, among many others.</p>

  <p>Hidden under many meters of ice, a pool of meltwater lies under the
 Greenland Ice Sheet. Kristin Poinar studies how the meltwater forms and
 flows in this dynamic glacial system. She asks: How did this water get

climate change affecting this system? </p><p>Using data from <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/icebridge/index.html" target="_blank">Operation IceBridge</a> flights and from field instruments, she's building a numerical model of how crevasses form and channel water.

immigrants all over the world.
  </div>

  <p>Jorge Ramos immigrated to the United States from Mexico City, on a 
student visa at the age of 24. What started as a street beat for a local
 Spanish-language broadcast in Los Angeles in the 1980s has evolved into
 a career of remarkable distinction and credibility. Today, Ramos 
co-anchors Univision's flagship Spanish-language broadcast, “Noticiero 
Univisión," writes a nationally syndicated column, hosts the Sunday 
Morning show "Al Punto" and now, the English language program, "America 
with Jorge Ramos." He is the winner of eight Emmys and the author of 
eleven books, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1101989637/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=1101989637&amp;linkId=d3fcd625d1a8af0a3eb2e8afee0119af" target="_blank"><em>Take a Stand: Lessons from Rebels</em></a>, 2016;  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307475549/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0307475549&amp;linkId=3f56ed15ba1ddefcd722db7f27bd6482" target="_blank"><em>A Country for All: An Immigrant Manifesto</em></a><em>; </em>and  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W6RS5Q/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B001W6RS5Q&amp;linkId=2cc69496c22a15ba323fa4db79c17022" target="_blank"><em>Dying to Cross: The Worst Immigrant Tragedy in American History</em></a>.</p><p>
  In the absence of political representation in the United States, Jorge
 Ramos gives a face and voice to the millions of Latinos and immigrants 
living in the United States. He uses his platform to promote open 
borders and immigrants' rights and demands accountability from the world
 leaders he interviews. Nearly 1.9 million viewers tune into his program
 each night, and in 2015, Time named him one of "The World's 100 Most 
Influential People."</p>

  <p>Computer scientist Joseph Redmon is working on the YOLO (You Only

recognition and object detection at a speed that would seem 
science-fictional only a few years ago. The algorithm looks like the 
simple face detection of a camera app but with the level complexity of 
systems like Google's Deep Mind Cloud Vision, using Convolutional Deep

 technology that will be embedded on all smartphones in the next few

 a seat in the British House of Lords in 2009, Rabbi Lord Sacks is a key
 Jewish voice for universalism and an embrace of tolerance between 
religions and cultures. He rejects the “politics of anger” brought about
 by the way “we have acted as if markets can function without morals, 
international corporations without social responsibility and economic 
systems without regard to their effect on the people left stranded by 
the shifting tide." He also sees, as a key idea for faith in our times,

    Robert Sapolsky is one of the leading neuroscientists in the world, studying stress in primates (including humans).

  <p>We all have some measure of stress, and Robert Sapolsky explores 
its causes as well as its effects on our bodies (his lab was among the 
first to document the damage that stress can do to our hippocampus). In 
his research, he follows a population of wild baboons in Kenya, who 
experience stress very similarly to the way humans do. By measuring 
hormone levels and stress-related diseases in each primate, he 
determines their relative stress, looking for patterns in personality 
and social behavior that might contribute. These exercises have given 
Sapolsky amazing insight into all primate social behavior, including our
 own. <br> <br>He has been called "one of the best scientist-writers of 
our time" by Oliver Sacks. Sapolsky has produced, in addition to 
numerous scientific papers, books for broader audiences, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743202414/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0743202414&amp;linkId=c77042a21ca8162d0b8867853526b5ba" target="_blank"><em>A Primate’s Memoir: A Neuroscientist’s Unconventional Life Among the Baboons</em></a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716732106/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0716732106&amp;linkId=466047943345bdcc5ce51672dac5622a" target="_blank"><em>Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers: Stress Disease and Coping</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0684838915/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=teco06-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0684838915&amp;linkId=4ac5199f220a51cbe9c2088318a7657a" target="_blank"><em>The Trouble with Testosterone</em></a>.</p>

    Tomás Saraceno is an artist who invites us to consider the impossible, like spiders that play music or cities in the sky.
  </div>

  <p>Tomás Saraceno’s soaring artworks inspire human dreams and point 
to a world free of our earth-bound afflictions, whether by suspending 
its viewers in webs high above gallery floors or by casting solar<em>-</em>powered baloons adrift in the stratosphere -- or turning spiders into music-makers.</p>  <p>Part art project and science experiment, his latest work <a href="http://aerocene.org/" target="_blank"><em>Aerocene</em></a> bypasses the museum in favor of an unprecedented airborne journey. Using only the heat of the sun and wind for its locomotion, <em>Aerocene</em>
 not only shattered solar-powered flight records but also invites others
 to hack its open-source, interactive design and model its flight 
behavior.</p>

    In his provocative, mind-bending book "The Secret Life of the Mind,"
 neurologist Mariano Sigman reveals his life’s work exploring the inner 
workings of the human brain.

  <p>Mariano Sigman, a physicist by training, is a leading figure in the
 cognitive neuroscience of learning and decision making. He is the 
founder of the Integrative Neuroscience Laboratory at the University of 
Buenos Aires. Sigman was awarded a Human Frontiers Career Development 
Award, the National Prize of Physics, the Young Investigator Prize of 
"College de France," the IBM Scalable Data Analytics Award and is a 
scholar of the James S. McDonnell Foundation. In 2016 he was made a 
Laureate of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.</p>  <p>In <em>The Secret Life of the Mind</em>,
 Sigman’s ambition is to explain the mind so that we can understand 
ourselves and others more deeply. He shows how we form ideas during our 
first days of life, how we give shape to our fundamental decisions, how 
we dream and imagine, why we feel certain emotions, how the brain 
transforms and how who we are changes with it. Spanning biology, 
physics, mathematics, psychology, anthropology, linguistics, philosophy 
and medicine, as well as gastronomy, magic, music, chess, literature and
 art, The Secret Life of the Mind revolutionizes how neuroscience serves
 us in our lives, revealing how the infinity of neurons inside our 
brains manufacture how we perceive, reason, feel, dream and communicate.</p>

  <p>Guy Winch is a licensed psychologist who works with individuals, 
couples and families. As an advocate for psychological health, he has 
spent the last two decades adapting the findings of scientific studies 
into tools his patients, readers and audience members can use to enhance
 and maintain their mental health. As an identical twin with a keen eye 
for any signs of favoritism, he believes we need to practice emotional 
hygiene with the same diligence with which we practice personal and 
dental hygiene.</p><p>His recent book,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://geni.us/emotionalfirstaid" target="_blank">Emotional First Aid: Healing Rejection, Guilt, Failure, and Other Everyday Hurts</a>,</em> has been translated in 21 languages.

    As a child, Huang Yi longed for a robot companion. As an adult, he created a robot to dance with: KUKA. 
  </div>

  <p>Taiwanese dancer, choreographer, inventor, and videographer Huang 
Yi’s pioneering work is steeped in his fascination with the partnership 
between humans and robots. He interweaves continuous movement with 
mechanical and multimedia elements to create a form of dance which 
corresponds with the flow of data, effectively making the performer a 
dancing instrument. Named by <em>Dance Magazine</em> as one of the “25 to Watch,” Huang is one of Asia’s most prolific choreographers.</p><p>Harmoniously
 weaving together the art of dance and the science of mechanical 
engineering, HUANG YI &amp; KUKA is a poetic work that intertwines 
modern dance and visual arts with the realm of robotics, revealing 
humanity through a series of vignettes between live dancers and KUKA, a 
robot conceptualized and programmed by Huang. “Dancing face to face with
 a robot is like looking at my own face in a mirror...I think I have 
found the key to spin human emotions into robots,” Huang asserts.</p>  <p>HUANG
 YI &amp; KUKA is an original production of Huang Yi Studio +, developed
 at 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center, in association with Sozo Artists. 
Commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Manoush Zomorodi is the host and managing editor of <em>Note to Self</em>,
 “the tech show about being human,” from WNYC Studios. Through 
experiments and conversations with listeners and experts, she examines 
the new questions tech has brought into our lives. Topics include 
information overload, digital clutter, sexting “scandals" and the 
eavesdropping capabilities of our gadgets. </p><p>In January 2017, Manoush and Note to Self launched "<a href="https://project.wnyc.org/privacy-paradox/" target="_blank">The Privacy Paradox</a>,"
 a 5-part plan to help people take back control over their digital

stick up for our internet rights." Her book exploring how boredom can
