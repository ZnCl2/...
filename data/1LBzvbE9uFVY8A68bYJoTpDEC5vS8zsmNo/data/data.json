It is my hometown, but really, think about it now, it is never home. my father was killed in some sort of literarily-named revolution, he died young. my mother remarried but remained unhappy for the rest of her life. here i am now, mostly happy, because i have a happy family, with happy children. yes i am happy now but could never forget the past. yes the past passed but one day i think it could haunt back.\n\nI teach. but do i enjoy it? yes and no. i enjoyed it to the degree of learning myself. but i do not like it because i truly think people can never learn, yes they learn somewhat, but they never change. learning but not changing, that is frustrating when thinking about it. but let it be. it is ok. we should never hope to change others, and they will not change anyway. but if you think about it, why they should change, change into what, and change might not do them good. \n\nTo those good students i say my name. to those midiocres i say welcome. so you know my room is open for some of you, but not all."
