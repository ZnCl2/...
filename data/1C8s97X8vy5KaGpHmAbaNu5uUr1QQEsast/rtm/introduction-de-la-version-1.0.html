<h1>Introduction to version 1.0<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-de-la-version-1-0" title="Permalink to this headline"> </a></h1>
<p>That&#8217;s my economic activities experience of 20 years which went from volunteering to entrepreneurship passing to wage earners, in a deeply crisis system, which had seen his paroxysmal peak in 2007, which pushed me to be interested to money. Hitherto, it doesn&#8217;t appear me that socials and economics issues could be linked to code&#8217;s nature which governs however the whole exchange activities.</p>
<p>Models applied by financial world are based on prejudices about the value&#8217;s nature, and are in 2010 highly influenced by theoretical developments of quantum mechanics, not for money structure, but to estimate risks&#8217; investment.</p>
<p>But, and it is without doubt there the contribution of Relative Theory of Money, we must realize globalization issues which leads billions of people to develops monetized exchanges, as historical imbalances of intercontinental exchanges.</p>
<p>But for that global scale, this are linked ideas not to quantum mechanics, but to Relativity, which are the most relevant to hope understand which doesn&#8217;t works and try to bring necessary mutations.</p>
<p>An analysis based on the economic experience, associated with a study of mechanisms of the actual monetary system, made me understand that this latter relied on pre-relativists concepts and on a deeply asymmetry, which made centers of monetary issuance anomalies that are sources of bias.</p>
<p>The book&#8217;s subject is not to define the monetary system as it exist, but to define what would be an equitable money in the space-time, and which I also called &#8220;relative money&#8221; in that it can&#8217;t be define only relatively to every independent measure coordinate system: that linked to all citizen of a concern economic zone.</p>
<p>We will see that this is the fundamental notion of a field of value in expansion which allows understand the economic evolution under a global angle, and which forces us to define money, not only by encompassing economy as it is here and now, but also as it will be for future generations. This approach implies not only to redefine the monetary system in agreement with the relativity principle (which is a principle of symmetry), but also allows to interpret historical economic phenomenon with a new point of view, of new concepts, and therefore a new causal interpretation.</p>
<p>I will finish this introduction by saying the very great inside surprise which I felt when I discovered the Universal Dividend as a central paradigm of relativist money. I wasn&#8217;t really prepared to the beginning of that reflection.</p>
<p>But then, I will return, my astonishment were even greater when I discovered Yoland Bresson&#8217;s &#8220;time value&#8221; works. Even if differentials equations he proposes differ on its form than those I established to describe the same notion of value field, we exactly found the same related settings of global measures and locals ones. I didn&#8217;t struggle to translate them in to my own theoretical reference to understand them.</p>
<p>Whereas Yoland Bresson&#8217;s process went from an economics exchanges theorization, and that mine went from a relativist money theory, the fact that both approaches lead to a similar result have only to consolidate my conviction of his large result&#8217;s relevance, and that&#8217;s why I told him to write the preface of Relative Theory of Money.</p>
<p>I desired synthesize the conclusions&#8217; essential which I&nbsp;lead to, and I furthermore profusely illustrated on the website <a class="reference external" href="http://www.creationmonetaire.info">http://www.creationmonetaire.info</a>.</p>
<p>I would like the relative money theory permit help to establish the most equitable possible economy, and it would be beneficial to the whole persons presents and future.</p>
