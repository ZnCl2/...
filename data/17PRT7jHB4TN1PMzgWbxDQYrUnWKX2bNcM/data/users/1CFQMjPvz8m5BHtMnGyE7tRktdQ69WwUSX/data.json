			"title": "Adding existing React website to ZeroNet",
			"body": "Hi. I developed a React based dapp which makes json rpc s and communicates with a test blockchain. Is there a way for me and users to use the dapp in ZeroNet? I've created new (and cloned existing) zites before, but this one was developed in a different environment and needs the CORS plugin and perhaps other modifications to get it working. I've seen the documentation at https://zeronet.io/docs/ but can't seem to find out how to implement a plugin and make other necessary adjustments. Thx for any help ...",
