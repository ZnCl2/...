			"body": "The ZeroHello site has some nice stats and graphs, but none accurately represent the space used on disk. So it's hard to tell how much space is being taken up w/o using filesystem tools.\n\nRight now the system reports 999MB used, and size on disk is 1.27GB, since there are a metric fuck-ton of small files and folders:\n123,434 files and 69,199 folders.\n\nIs there another place where the size is more accurately reported or is this going to end up a feature request?",
