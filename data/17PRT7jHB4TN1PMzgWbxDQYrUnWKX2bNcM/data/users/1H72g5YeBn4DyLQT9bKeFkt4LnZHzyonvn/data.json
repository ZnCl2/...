			"body": "I believe you can use `fileWrite` to write a file to that subdirectory and then `fileDelete` to delete just the file but keep the directory, though agreed that this is a little silly if all you want to do is make a folder (but why would you just make a folder, presumably you're going to put a file in it at some point and thus the folder will just be made then?).\n\nRegardless, I believe the code for it would be:\n\n```\nasync myFunc() {\n    await zeroframe.cmdp(\"fileWrite\", [inner_path + \"/file\", \"\"]);\n    await zeroframe.cmdp(\"fileDelete\", [inner_path + \"/file\"]);\n}\n```",
