			"body": "Okay, so how I solve this is by referencing the auth_address of the user who posted the comment along with the id of the comment. Therefore, comments can use same id's as long as it's from different people.\n\nBut, to make sure the id's are unique for that one user, you need to implement a keyvalue that stores that next id to be used and then increment that when a new comment is posted. Then, you can use that value as the id for the next comment. This is what I did at first. **However**, there's an easier way, which is to just store that date the comment was posted as the id - this solution is *much* simpler than the other one.\n\nThere is technically the problem where if the user's time on their computer is wrong, then there could technically be overlap, but I think the chance of that happening is pretty low, imo.",
