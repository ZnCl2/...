			"body": ">\"Purposes only exist in relation to subjects. For example, a stream as such doesn't have a purpose, it only has and can only have a purpose when placed in relation to man (as a travel route, water supply, scenery, etc.). For a thing to have a purpose, intrinsically, requires that it have a goal, or end, with the implication that this end has not been reached or attained.\"\n\nThis was what someone told me when I asked a similar question (what's the purpose/meaning of life?). In short it's basically saying that there's no objective 'purpose' or 'meaning' and that it solely depends on what the end goal is.",
