			"body": "Not that I know of, but you could make your own zite by cloning the [GitHub-Repository](https://github.com/krixano/ZeroExchange/) or the [GitCenter-Repo](/17isV4gG9MmAwfcR6aroBN1nHmovrhodD4) into a new zite, then running `npm install` in your command line while being in the zite-directory, which will install all the npm-modules.\n\nAlso you should edit the zites `content.json`-file to ignore all the development-files (look at the `ignore`-stuff [here (/ZeroExchange.bit/content.json)](/ZeroExchange.bit/content.json).\nNext up you need to build the stuff by running gulp with ... `gulp`, in the command line, also in the zite-directory.\nThis will create all the files, people actually see on the zite.\n\nFinished!\n\nOf course that's kind of dumb, because you'd be creating a new ZeroExchange, just for Chinese users, which I believe isn't really good, as ZeroExchange does have the feature of \"Topics\", so you could just request a new topic by 0-mailing to `krixano@zeroid.bit`.\nThough I still think Chinese users should just write in Chinese in the topics that are just there anyways, because I bet that @Krixano will, at some point, put a language selection thingy somewhere here.. (no guarantee though).",
