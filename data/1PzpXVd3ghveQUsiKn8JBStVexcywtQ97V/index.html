<h4>TrackerSync</h4>
<h3>What is this?</h3>
<h1>This site contains a list file,which you can configure zeronet to read trackers from and use them to find more peers.The list can be dynamically updated,so only good and fast trackers are used.</h1>
<h3>How to use it?</h3>
<h1>In Zeronet settings(http://127.0.0.1:43110/Config),copy the following line to the "Trackers files" section:</h1>
<h2>data/1PzpXVd3ghveQUsiKn8JBStVexcywtQ97V/trackers.txt</h2>
<h1>Like this:</h1>
<img src="example.png" alt="example"><br/>
<h1>In some instances,Zeronet won't find the file if backslashes are used in the address.In that case,just use regular slashes.Apart from that,a restart is maybe required,and the trackers should work fine.</h1>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<h1>First this project started as an experiment,to see if the concept is working.<br/>As has been proven it works without a problem,the aim is to provide a secondary solution,if Zeronet's trackers go offline for some reason.I will add more and more working trackers,and remove the ones that became dead.</h1>
<h3>Ideas,discussion</h3>
<h1>I started a new thread on Zerotalk about the subject.Let's have a discussion,any idea or comment is welcome!<br/>Also feel free to suggest trackers to be added into the list!</h1>
