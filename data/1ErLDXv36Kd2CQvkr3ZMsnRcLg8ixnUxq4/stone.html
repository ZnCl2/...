				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
				We are all working towards the same goal of Godhood whether the path be by Kundalini Yoga, The Magnum Opus, or any other spiritual workings.
				As you progress in spiritual transformation, you understand and see more of the corruption and unfinished work of our souls.
				These spiritual workings, especially the Philosopher's Stone, will repair and bring your soul to Godhood.
				All of the alchemical goals can be reached quickly with the Philosopher's Stone.
				These alchemical goals are combine Spirit and Earth, Merge the Twin Serpents (Ida & Pingala), Unite the Upper and Lower Chakras, and Creating and using the elixir of life.
				The Philosophers Stone does all this at the same time.
				The Philosopher's Stone is always recreating itself, in a way always going through death and rebirth.
				The Philosopher's Stone is in itself a constant transformation, always active.
				Once the body completely adjusts to the stone's energy, the body will always be recreating itself, always keeping your body active.
				This is how Immortality works as the elixir of life is always recreating itself staying always active and new. As for magickal workings with the stone.
				You can multiply the power of your intentions as many time as you like and the stone continues to multiply the power of your intentions as long after it is programmed.

				<h2>The Process:</h2>
				<p>
					The explanation and understanding of how the stone works is a pain in the ass.
					The Philosopher's Stone contains the elixir of life, the soul, and aura.
					That is the formula.
					These ingredients of the stone are all made of each other, the same thing, but separate.
					The Aura is made of the very energy of all the physical world, electromagnetic energy.
					The Soul is made up of bioelectricity but the upper chakras are magnetic and the lower chakras are electric yet both sets are bioelectric which is electromagnetic.
					The Elixir of life is the male elixir, female elixir, and sexual elixir energies.
					Male is electric, female is magnetic, and sexual is electromagnetic while all are bioelectric.
					Since our body runs off bioelectricity, our Aura is bioelectric as well.
					Electric and Magnetic energy (male and female) are united by electromagnetic energy (sex), which creates electromagnetic/bioelectric energy (Male -i- Female + Sex/or just Sex).
					From this bioelectricity/electromagnetic energy (male + female + sex/or just sex) unites electric and magnetic energy again and the process is continued.
					The way it processes is that male (electric/bioelectric) -i- female (magnetic/bioelectric) + sexual (electromagnetic/bioelectric) energy = sexual energy (electromagnetic/bioelectricity) which is both male (electric/bioelectric) and female (magnetic/bioelectric) again.
					The stone creates the very energy that creates the stone.
					If you cannot understand this, I'm sorry, there is no other way to explain the process.

				<h2>Workings of Alchemy:</h2>
				<p>
					To merge the twin serpents (Ida & Pingala) is to merge the male and female aspects of the soul.
					Each serpent or aspect of the soul is one third of an already perfect soul.
					There's the Male (Pingala), Female (Ida), and Sexual (Sushumna) parts of the soul.
					To reach godhood, these parts of the soul need to completely merge.
					This is usually done with Kundallnl Yoga as it increases the sexual energy (the power) of the sushumna which brings the nnale ida and pingala together.
					This is best done by sexual relations with demons or the Cobra Breath Technique.
					The Philosopher's Stone does this as well. The process of how can be found in the above paragraph.
					The Ida is the female elixir, is magnetic energy, and is bioelectricity/electromagnetic energy.
					The Pingala is the male elixir, is electric energy, and is bioelectricity/electromagnetic energy.
					The Sushumna is the sexual elixir, electromagnetic and is bioelectricity.
					To "Combine Spirit and Earth" is to combine the soul with the energy of the physical world.
					These two are united by the elixer of life which is made of both energy of the soul and the energy of the physical world.
					The stone does this. Uniting the Upper and Lower chakras is the same as merging the ida & pingala aspects of the soul.
					Upper chakras are feminine, magnetic, and bioelectric/electromagnetic while the lower chakras are masculine, electric, and bioelectric/electromagnetic.
					The heart chakra is sexual and bioelectric/electromagnetic. The stone unites these.
					The elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Air, Quintessence) are all from electric, magnetic, or electromagnetic properties.
					The soul's Ida, pingala, and sushumna are of the elements.
					The stone will awake the elements within the soul.

				<h2>Stages of Progression:</h2>
				<p>
					From experience, I have learned of major stages in spiritual progression.
					When we progress we "repair" our own souls and bodies as they both have been corrupted and cut off from each other.
					After doing the Cobra Breath technique for so long, my sushumna transformed and it impacted my physical body.
					My sushumna was repaired from what i experienced.
					Prior to this change in my body and soul, my elixir energies would flow freely throughout the body after stimulation of their ruling glands.
					After the change, after stimulating the elixir glands (Pineal, Sacral, Sexual glands), the elixir energy would automatically flow through the sushumna.
					The male elixir would flow up through the chakras and into the aura as sexual energy already did and the female elixir of the pineal gland would flow down the sushumna through the chakras and into the aura.
					The body/soul now directs the elixir of life energies into the soul, body, and aura on its own.
					This is a big stage and it reveals so much.
					This stage is important and needs to be revealed to further understand and create the philosophers stone and its working.
					I would also like to mention that after your chakras become completely full of the elixir of life, you can expect your kundalini's initial rising.
					The Philosopher's Stone is EXTREMELY powerful.
					Your Body will be impacted as well as your soul. You have been warned.
					Spiritual Requirements for the Stone: I recommend to begin working with the stone only after your sushumna has been transformed in the way mentioned above.
					To reach this level stimulate your kundalini often so that sexual energy rises up the chakras empowering the sushumna.
					This can easily be done by The Cobra Breath technique, frequent sex with a demon, or simply empowering your base chakra often.
					Once this level is reached, empowering your chakras and Aura with the elixir energies is way easier and quicker.
					AII the elixir energies should already be strong in your chakras in soul.
					This is needed and is important for the creation of the philosopher's stone.
					AII chakras must be at awakened and strong.

				<h2>Preparation:</h2>
				<p>
					To prepare and meet the requirements for tine stone's creation perform the following meditation for a few weeks.
					Condense your Aura into a small ball of light and circulate through all the front and back chakra extensions, as well as stimulate the pineal gland with it.
					Finish at the base chakra and then place the ball a few inches below the base chakra directly on the kundalini serpent and hold it until it for a while until it activates sexual energy up the spine.
					Next time you do this meditation, condense the aura into the previous ball as this builds it's power.
					Save this ball for the stone's creation.
					Be sure to be frequently doing the Sacral Meditation from the Magnum Opus preliminary exercises to get the Male Elixir going as well.
					The soul must be prepared before the creation of this stone.
				</p>

				<h2>The Creation:</h2>
				<p>
					Extract a bit of bioelectricity from *each* of the 7 main chakras and place it into the ball. This bioelectricity from the chakras will activate your stone'strue power.
					You should feel the effects immediately after if your ball/stone is in your sacral chakra as it will circulate the energy. That is the creation of the stone.
					The stone should now have all of the formula, Bioelectricity + Aura + Elixir of life - or - Energy of Soul + Energy of Physical World + Energy of Immortality/Perfection
				</p>
			</div>
		</section>

		<section class="row">
			<div class="col-full">
				<h2>Cautions:</h2>
				<p>
					You should be able to feel the stone's new kind of energy.
					You may be able to feel the stone's "process" and may now understand how it works.
					If the energy is too strong for you, place the ball elsewhere such as your astral temple as the sacral chakra serves to circulate its energy throughout your soul and body.
					Work with it until you are able to keep it in your sacral chakra.
					This stone is EXREMELY powerful! It is the quickest and fastest way to godhood!

				<h2>Working with the Stone:</h2>
				<p>
					To empower the stone, you pretty must recreate it but adding on to it's power.
					Condense the aura into the stone, circulate it, and *Optionally* finish with extracting the new bioelectricity the 7 main chakras into the stone.
					There are other ways of using the stone such as connecting all your chakras to the heart chakra and spinning the stone in the center of the heart chakra.
					You may also use the circulate the stone in and out of weak chakras to strengthen them.
					Keep the stone clean by cleaning it daily they way you clean you aura and chakras.
					When the stone touches a chakra, the chakra will move closer to the perfect soul or godhood.
					All the alchemical workings can be defined by the simple circulating of the stone throughout the chakras.

				<h2>Magickal Workings:</h2>
				<p>
					The stone when programmed with your intentions, will constantly imprint your intentions throughout time.
					With that said, the power of your intentions/desires will be MULTIPLYING as time goes by.
					When you circulate a programmed stone throughout the chakras, you will imprinting and programming your soul with your desires over and over, quickly saturating your soul.
					When you place a programmed stone in the sacral chakra, your intentions will circulate throughout your soul, always programming your soul.
					You can vibrate a rune to further saturate the stone with your desires.
					The power of this stone is meant to create your perfect material life while perfecting your spiritual life.

				<h2>Stages of Transformation:</h2>
				<p>
					As you continue to work with the stone, your body and soul will go through many transformations on its own.
					This is because the stone is a combination of all alchemy workings and the stone is god (immortal/Perfect) energy itself.
					Your body and Soul adjusts to this.
