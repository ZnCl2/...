					Recently, terrorism attacks in Europe related to “Islamic State” and Islamic fundamentalism are getting more frequent, I'll try explaining what's going on.

				<h2>Islamic State exposed</h2>
				<p>
					It's pretty obvious that Islamic State is directly ruled by Jews and Israel, trough American CIA.
					Jews' tactic is to never expose themselves directly, they hide behind Gentiles to make them take all
					the blame for Jews actions. You can notice ISIS is ruled by Jews because terrorist claim to hate Jews
					and Israel, but they don't try invading or attacking it, even if Jews kill and treat Muslims in Israel as
					animals. That clearly means ISIS leaders are Jews and the whole Islamic State is ruled by Jews.

				<h2>About recent terrorism attacks is Europe</h2>
				<p>
					Since Islamic State's terrorists started attacking important cities in Europe, the trend is to make
					some hash-tags go viral: #PrayForParis first, now #PrayForBruxelles etc. It's not new that Jews
					control all mass-media, press, and social networks, it isn't new also the fact they know well how to
					control masses for manipulating and make Gentile people think and believe in what Jews want them	
					to believe. I will not go in detail about how Jews manipulate Gentiles in this pdf, but good resources
					about this are easy to find on Internet, see the Protocols of the Elders of Zion as example.

				<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
				<p>
					Jews are losing their power over the world and Gentile Volk all over the world is waking up from
					their lies. Jews know that and start trying save themselves by acting desperate like this. With their
					terrorism attacks over Europe, they want Gentiles fear they could die soon, they could be the next
					Islamic State objective for an attack. As we know, Jews' “god” takes power from People's fear and
					negativity. We also know that their so called god takes power when people prays him, because by
					praying, people gives it a little of energy to it. Now, Jews are trying using both this methods (fear
					and prayer) to gain some power for lasting as long as they can, they are desperate, they are at their
					last breaths.

				<h2>Ending</h2>
				<p>
					That only means Satanists are making impact and Jews will be nothing more than a memory of the
					past soon. They are trying to make Gentiles think that we are losing, while it is the exact opposite.
					It's important that everyone keeps empowering and evolving spiritually, and also keep doing Joy of
					Satan rituals against Torah and Jews, that's how we will win this war.
