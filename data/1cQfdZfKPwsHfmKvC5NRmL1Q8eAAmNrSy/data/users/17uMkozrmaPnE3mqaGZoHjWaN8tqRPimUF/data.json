			"body": "If you've been enjoying furry art on the internet for any (un)reasonable amount of time I'm sure you've been burned on some artists who've decided to purge their galleries or take down their art from third party hosts thus losing helpful metadata like image content tags. The question is: have any of you started personal archives, saving things locally or on a controlled server, and how much of a hoarder have you become?\n\nI've been regularly saving things I like for about half a decade now, and I've amassed a little over 97,000 files, furry in nature, with ~15,000 being from comics and ~20,000 from bulk downloads (everything else is mostly handpicked). If you're as far gone as I am then you're probably using some kind of media manager. I've been using Hydrus which is like a personal booru primarily focused on images, and it's been serving me well. It'd be interesting to see if any of you have any novel means of organization especially for collections which are too big to just dump in a single folder.",
