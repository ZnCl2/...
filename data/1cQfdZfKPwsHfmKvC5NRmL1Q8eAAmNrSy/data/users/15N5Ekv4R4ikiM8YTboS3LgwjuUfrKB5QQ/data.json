It's also no surprise a lot of us are in tech (no citation here, sorry).\n\nNow, why are there so little members here? in comparison to clearnet, in comparison to other zites.\n\nIs there an actual reason for it? Will the death of 8ch flood the pool with them? Is there just no interest? Are furs just too left?\n\nplz discuss :3",
