I've seen a handful of lolita fashion kemono shoots that utilize these genres well, and the expressive form of gl fashion livens the characters up a lot.\npic related: https://imgur.com/24p5vRL (I'll look into using the gallery more in the future, but I think with relatively few peers at present, it will be a bit unreliable for now.)\nI also enjoy the spectacle of Japanese-inspired western fursuits--I see some at Anime Weekend Atlanta that have pretty spectacular ensembles, but fursuiters don't seem to carry social media cards as much as other cosplayers at anime cons (lack of pockets?) so I don't keep up with them as much.",

			"body": "I'm making threads on this board, whether you like it or not!\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI've been a big sonic mood lately, mainly pining for the Sonic Adventure games. The first game has so much bullshit going on, but there are just a handful of awesome parts in it I will always love. It was the first game I ever bought as kid, so I'll never really be able to let it go. There is some real high quality lore delivered in that game, and Knuckles' and E-102's stories are still great imo. They are just surrounded by ... all the rest. I could talk about SA2 but we'd be here forever. I'm thinking about getting a Dreamcast secondhand just to get the true SA experience. :b",

				"body": "Welcome new users! Nothing like a good tragedy to get ZeroNet active again. I've been using the service on and off for a couple years now I think, and we haven't had a real spike in users since the ICANN was given up in October of 2016. (Wow, it's been that long?)\nIn a word, it's harder to find sites here. I think this one got linked on the main ZeroTalk site a few months back, that's where I found it, and the thread was relatively popular. I say relatively because a popular until recently would be one with like 10 comments, now they get like 80! Very excited.\nI don't know how much potential this site has on its own, I do really like text based boards though. I've seen someone talking about making a proper messageboard like the OG chans. I think having a board there could be preferable--just being in closer proximity to other 'net users gets attention. Right now, we're kind of our little island.",
