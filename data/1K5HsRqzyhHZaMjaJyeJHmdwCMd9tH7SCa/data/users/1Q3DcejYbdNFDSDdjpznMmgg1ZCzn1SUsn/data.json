I will publish another quick article on how to configure pf to push the ZeroNet + Tor through a VPN with dnscrypt_proxy (not much left to leak...) #parano #chasingtheperfectsetup #openforcomments\n\nSounds good ! I've no experience with pf(4) so far so that's a topic I would enjoy to read about ! Now you remind me I should Invest some time in setting up a kill switch or some strict outbound firewall rules for my newly setup VPN, not that it goes down or anything so far but it would be better. #paranotoo :)",
