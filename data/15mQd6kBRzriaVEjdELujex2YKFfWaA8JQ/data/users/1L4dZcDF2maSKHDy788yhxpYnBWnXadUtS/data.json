			"body": "your video is NOT autoplaying there which may mean the issue is in video. Differences between our videos: https://snag.gy/W0fNcn.jpg\nUPDATE: i tried to paste your code to my blog:\n<video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" src=\"/15mQd6kBRzriaVEjdELujex2YKFfWaA8JQ/data/img/Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--MP4.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">This browser does not stream this video</video>\n\nand it was autoplaying and looping even after page reload! which means problem is in your zeroblog? I am using [ZeroBlog Plus](/15mSYzsDxzarssqtV1pFPKqoCTaLdjVB2f/) , though if that is the cause, i do not understand how zite coding could influence video auto-playback.",

			"body": "> data-cke-saved-src\n\nthis is some programming error in the ZeroBlog i think. but despite of this, you can always revert back to original code and if the code is right, it will work - show up video (if the browser support it)\n\nIn my case i am using [ZeroBlog++](/19fZJhX7FGENeRRLB8ftgrziBJ5vsLtFog) and on it the video **worked** and showed up playing in Firefox beta (72.0). The video not shown (empty big space) when i just revert from text/code editor into WYSIWYG editor mode (< / > button)",
