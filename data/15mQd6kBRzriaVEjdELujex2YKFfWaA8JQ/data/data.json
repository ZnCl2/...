In both I have to right click on the image and select \"Play\". I expected that in Vivaldi because I have an extension to prevent autoplaying videos. But I have no such extension in Firefox.\n\nNow I wonder if ages ago, when I was being particularly annoyed by autoplaying videos, maybe I went into Firefox's `about:config` and set autoplay to \"false\".\n\nLooking there I see this:\n\n`dom.media.autoplay.autoplay-policy-api;false`\n\nI'll try changing that and reloading.\n\nNope, that did not make a difference. The video is just a still image until I right-click and choose play."

And the same things happens (to the same emojis) when I copy & paste here on ZeroBlog. (Just realized, they seem to be the sames ones that don't show right on the webpage in my browser either.)\n\nUnfortunately the emojis that fail are among the ones I'd probably most like to use to indicate media type I'm sharing on my \"media share\" blog.\n\nLet's see when I try copying & pasting those straight from the webpage into this post:\n\n*   Film frames, copied from Vivaldi where it doesn't show: 🎞\n\n*   Film frames, copied from Firefox where it **does** show: 🎞\n\nSame result for me: just an empty square both times. EDIT: when viewed in Vivaldi, they're both blank squares. But when viewed in Firefox, I see the film frames both times. And at the top of the page too.\n\nIn fact the other problematic ones (camera with flash, studio microphone, pirate flag) also work in Firefox."

			"body": "Just like I did with MP4 in the previous post, I'll try manually copying the WebM into this blog's `data/img` folder and then switch into Markdown edit mode (clicking `</>` button at top right) to put in HTML code.\n\nI use almost the same code, but changing the file name and type, to `video/webm`.\n\n```\n<video width=\"500\" height=\"286\" autoplay loop>  <source src=\"Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--WEBM.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />  Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n```\n\n<video width=\"500\" height=\"286\" loop=\"\" flashstopped=\"true\" id=\"dummyid39\" preload=\"metadata\"><source data-cke-saved-src=\"Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--WEBM.webm\" src=\"Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--WEBM.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\nYour browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\nFailure!!! I do not see the video at all, at least in the browser I'm using now (Vivaldi, based on Chromium). There is a big empty space where the video should be.\n\nGoing back into the markdown editor, I notice the first line of the HTML has had something added to it. It's gone from this:\n\n```\n<video width=\"500\" height=\"286\" autoplay loop>\n```\n\nto this:\n\n```\n<video width=\"500\" height=\"286\" loop=\"\" flashstopped=\"true\" id=\"dummyid39\" preload=\"metadata\">\n```\n\nWhy, I do not know. I'll try saving, sign and publishing the post, then viewing in other browsers to see what happens.\n\n*   Firefox: same big empty space.\n*   Chrome: same big empty space.\n\nBelow I'll try **editing** in other browsers, to see if I can take out and keep out that unwanted code insertion. Trying in Chrome now...\n\n<video width=\"500\" height=\"286\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\"><source data-cke-saved-src=\"Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--WEBM.webm\" src=\"Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--WEBM.webm\" type=\"video/webm\"> Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\nAgain, failure! Again, a big empty space. Again, the HTML code has been changed against my will. But this time it's been changed in a different way. Now the first **two** lines are:\n\n```\n<video width=\"500\" height=\"286\" autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\">​​​​​​​<source data-cke-saved-src=\"Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--WEBM.webm\" src=\"Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--WEBM.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n```\n\nAs wells as the changes to the first line, in the second, just plain `src` has become `data-cke-saved-src`. I don't know why, and I don't know what to do about this.\n\nSo at this stage, I cannot get a WebM to display in a ZeroBlog post at all, let alone playing and looping automatically like an animated GIF."

			"date_published": 1553113865.949,
			"body": "I'm looking for an alternative to animated GIFs, so I need the MP4 to behave like an animated GIF does:\n\n*   display automatically (the image is visible to the blog visitor without them having to do anything)\n*   play automatically (the blog visitor doesn't have to click on the video or press \"Play\", etc.)\n*   loop automatically (the blog visitor doesn't have to right-click and select \"Loop\", etc.)\n*   the whole image/animation is visible without any controls overlaid on it (e.g. no control bar obscuring the bottom part of the image)\n\nThe WYSIWYG editor does not have an \"Insert video\" button, so this will have to be 100% manual.\n\nAnd Markdown code does not have an \"Insert video\" tag (the way it has `![img name](img URL)` for images), so I will have to find and use appropriate HTML code.\n\nI've inserted a (long-form) video on my blog cloned from My ZeroBlog (see [this post here​​​​​​​](http://127.0.0.1:43110/1Ctjcvfovq6d1JWEGvM1JovCym4H6Es33L/?Post:8:Experimenting+with+uploads:+video)). Let's see if I can get the video working and displaying with all the other requirements (auto play, auto loop, no control bar) here on a regular ZeroBlog.\n\n* * *\n\n### Step 1\n\nI copy the MP4 into the same `\\data\\img` folder as the images.\n\n```\nC:\\Users\\Klu9\\Downloads\\ZeroNet-win-dist\\data\\15mQd6kBRzriaVEjdELujex2YKFfWaA8JQ\\data\\img\n```\n\n### Step2\n\nNow to find the right HTML code. From previous experiments, I already know how to do the following with HTML5 code on a **My**ZeroBlog:\n\n*   insert a video (hosted elsewhere on ZeroNet, e.g. KopyKate)\n*   make it auto-play\n\nThe question is, can I do the same here on a regular ZeroBlog? And can I do the following extras?\n\n*   make it auto-loop\n*   display without a control bar\n\nSo I do a search for [html code for video to auto play and loop](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=html+code+for+video+to+auto+play+and+loop). Then I search for [html code for video hide controls](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=html+code+for+video+hide+controls).\n\nI take a look at the following results\n\n*   StackExchange - [Play infinitely looping video on-load in HTML5](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10377453/play-infinitely-looping-video-on-load-in-html5)\n*   W3schools.com - [HTML video loop Attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/att_video_loop.asp)\n\nSo I will try to adjust the following code:\n\n```\n<video width=\"320\" height=\"240\" autoplay loop>\n  <source src=\"movie.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  <source src=\"movie.ogg\" type=\"video/ogg\" />\n  Your browser does not support the video tag.\n</video>\n```\n\nI'm using an MP4 (I'd forgotten about OGG, so I don't have a version in that format) and so I'll delete the line about OGG. I'll adjust the width and height attributes, as well as the URL obviously, to `<source src=\"data/img/FILE.NAME-mp4\"`\n\n```\n<video width=\"500\" height=\"286\" autoplay loop>     <source src=\"data/img/Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--MP4.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />    Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n```\n\n(For some reason the WYSIWYG code tool displays the original block of code on multiple lines of text, easier to view, but puts the second block of code all on one line, even when I try adjusting it back to multiple lines.)\n\nNow I'll try switching into Markdown edit mode and pasting that.\n\n<video loop=\"\" flashstopped=\"true\" id=\"dummyid89\" preload=\"metadata\" width=\"500\" height=\"286\"><source data-cke-saved-src=\"data/img/Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--MP4.mp4\" src=\"data/img/Monty.Python.Every.Sperm.Is.Sacred--MP4.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\nYour browser does not support the video tag.</video>\n\nSuccess!!! The MP4 video automatically displays, plays and loops, with no control bar visible.\n\n### **Correction: Failure!!! After reloading the page, the video does not play automatically, just a still image. In order to play, the user has to right-click on the still image, select \"Show controls\" and then press play.**\n\n### Notes\n\n*   One small point: in the WYSIWYG editor, I wasn't able to write anything below the video; I had to go back into the Markdown edit mode to write text below the video. Once I'd put some text down here in Markdown mode (\"Success!!!\"), then I could continue writing in WYSIWYG mode.\n*   For some reason, when I originally tried inserting a video with HTML code on a ZeroBlog (going back and forth between WYSIWYG and Markdown modes), it kept screwing up, in different ways. But here it went just fine. **CORRECTION: After publishing and reloading the page, the video does _not_ play, just a still image.**\n\n*   Autoplaying video tends to be a curse on the modern web. So I, like many people, have found a way to block that, in my case, using a browser extension. The video autoplays for me because I've specifically allowed / whitelisted `http://127.0.0.1:43110` in my browser extension. But other people may not have done that."
