				"body": "Like people have a zite signed by them, they need to have a directory with all their content (maybe its that a hub is, I not explore hub and merged knowledge at this time, I'm new on zeronet) signed by them. So the peers can verify the files like for zite before the update. The first advantage is security, the second is for spam, ban an user can ban all his content anywhere, the third is if someone die, community can create zite that merge the old content to the future content to continue the adventure. I need to learn more. ;) sry for my bad English too.\nYou can also clone your content and sign it with new key for save it in case of key lost or piracy",
