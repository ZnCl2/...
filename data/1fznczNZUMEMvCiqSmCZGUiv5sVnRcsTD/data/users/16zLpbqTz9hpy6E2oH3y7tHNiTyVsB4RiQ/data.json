Now they are sequentially displayed bulletin board style.\nimplementing a tree structure in the post themselves is difficult, I never saw a 100% satisfying solution, but a tree-structured index before or after the posts, or both, e.g.\n\nPost number one\nPost number two\n    Post number three\n        Post number four\n        Post number six\n    Post number five\n        Post number seven\nPost number eight\n\nlike in some old web interfaces for mailing lists, would help recognizing who answers to whom.",
