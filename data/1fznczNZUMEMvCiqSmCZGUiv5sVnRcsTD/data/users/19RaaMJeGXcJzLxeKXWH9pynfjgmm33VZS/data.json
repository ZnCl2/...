			"title": "Feature I would like to see: Zite's can be interacted with without needing to seed",
			"body": "By default, a zite should be interacted with like a clearnet site. If the user decides to help and seed the zite, they can. Sometimes, a user may want to help seed a zite but decides not to because they would then have to manage blacklists of users that post stuff they don't want to be seeding and that can become quite the list.\n\nWhile there would be a performance hit because the zite isn't being stored locally or on a local network, that's the trade off for not seeding.\n\nWe already have the distributed storage for everything, so the client can pull the pages down from multiple sources to help keep the speed up.\n\nThis might be a but more of a rambling and hard to understand, but I have the idea on my head, trying to find the right words to describe it might be confusing. I can explain more if any is interested.",
