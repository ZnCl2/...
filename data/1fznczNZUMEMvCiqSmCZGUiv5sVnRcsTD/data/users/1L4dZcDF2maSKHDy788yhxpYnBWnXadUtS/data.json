How can we back up them?\n\nmaybe this can help:\nhttps://hackage.haskell.org/package/github-backup\nhttps://github.com/IQAndreas/github-issues-import\n\n> A website for distributing binaries for Windows?\n\nchinese government blocked zeronet.io site i think, they not blocked github, so this may be hosted on github (https://pages.github.com ?), fosshub, gitlab or such.\n\n> .bit domains, registered by nofish. We cannot rely on them any more?\n\n[possibly no](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1516098717_1L4dZcDF2maSKHDy788yhxpYnBWnXadUtS), maybe the new zeronet maintainers should convert zerotalk, etc. databases contents .bit links to real addresses (maybe i can help with that) and setup new zerotalk etc site which will have contents of nofish's zerotalk.\n\n> nofish's ZeroMe hubs. Well, it is a problem\n\ni think it is lower priority task, but zeronet or zerome should be made to allow migration of a user profile between hubs, relevant Zerotalk topics: [#1](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:7_13Z7XxTa7JuFat3KzzMWu3onwM6biLuurJ), [#2](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1513334954_13aB79mzuRLgDYzQthn9wzycjw77WyDXh6)",
