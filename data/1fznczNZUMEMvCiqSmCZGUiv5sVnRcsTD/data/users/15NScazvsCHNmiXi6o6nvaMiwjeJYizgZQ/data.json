That will only encourage spammers to create multiple accounts, mine all at once.\n\nAs for implementation - can't we just add some PoW string to each post/comment (or other piece of content added)? Sort of like it is on bitmessage... Maybe that's not even a big change.. Could be integrated right into the js on the site, no?",

But I already see other problems there.. And still ZN has to run checks on it's own, not per-site.",
