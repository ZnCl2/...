</p>

Graphite (or Carbon) has been the main Anode for Chlorate production until it was 
replaced by MMO (Mixed Metal Oxides) Anodes. It is available to purchase as 
'Gouging rods', EDM (Electro Discharge Machine) Graphite, large electrodes and also carbon rods in dry cell batteries.
It is only suitable for Chlorate production, and will erode excessively if
used to make Perchlorate. Graphite may be dense and hard (EDM) or it may be 
more porous and softer/weaker (Gouging Rods).<br>
 It is advantageous to treat 
porous Graphite with Linseed oil or other substance  to fill up pours to slow up
 shredding and make it last longer in the cell.  See <a href="treating.html"> treating Graphite</a>.  There is 
little advantage in treating hard dense Graphite. Battery carbons do not need to be treated, see Wouters page for info. on battery rods. <BR>
If using Gouging rods the Copper metal coating must be peeled off first. Some small flakes of Copper can remain stuck to the rod. This Copper can be removed by electrolysing the rods in some NaCl until all Copper is gone and discarding the electrolyte. Rods will then need to be washed and dried if you are going to seal them.
 <br>The harder and more dense 
Graphite is, the longer it will last in a cell.<P>
The main advantage with Graphite is the fact that is is cheap and easily available
as 'Gouging rods', EDM or battery carbon rods. It is non toxic. The main disadvantage is the fact 
that it erodes a certain amount. This makes a black suspension/sludge in the cell that much
be removed. Purchasing  Graphite in  lump or sheet form and cutting  will  be cheaper than purchasing  rods. <P><p>
<IMG SRC="ph_erosion.jpg"  align=left hspace =10 border=3 alt="[Graphite Erosion versus pH]">
 For Graphite there are four main conditions that should be met to keep erosion to a minimum.<br>

<b><font color=red>I) </b></font>&#032The Chloride concentration in the cell should be kept above 50 Grams per Liter (this is most important). Severe Anode erosion will begin at 30g/l.<br>
<b><font color=red>II)</b></font> &#032The pH of the cell should be kept around neutral by adding acid to the cell (this is most important). <br></li>
<b><font color=red>III) </b></font>&#032The temperature of the cell should be kept below 40&deg;C though it can go up to 60&deg;C without undue erosion.<br>
<b><font color=red>IV)</b></font>&#032The current density (CD) on the Anode should be kept at around 35mA per cm squared. (33 to 43) is used in industry.<br>

Reading from reports of people using Graphite Anodes, it would appear that quite high current densities and quite high temperatures can be tolerated without excessive erosion. The big Graphite killer is low Chloride concentration and high cell pH.<br>
Be aware, especially with rods that as the Anode wears the rod gets thinner, the surface area gets less and current density will rise (if current is kept constant). As rod Anodes wear you need to lower the current going into cell or add more rods etc if you wish current density to remain constant. This problem does not happen so much with sheet Graphite.<br>
When you control pH you will get higher current efficiency and lower erosion  and the  Graphite that gets eroded does not all appear as black sludge 
(as in the non-pH controlled cell) but some of it goes off as  CO<Small>2</small>.<P>

The figures for Graphite erosion in a pH controlled cell are in the region of 3 to 6 grams Graphite sludge per kg Sodium Chlorate produced.<br>

Graphite is not to difficult to remove from the cell liquid when extraction of Sodium Chlorate begins. Boil the cell contents for approx. five or ten minutes (Al vessel not suitable) to destroy Hypochlorites and 
remove dissolved gas. Allow all the Graphite to settle to the bottom (few days) and decant off the clear liquid. The remaining small amount of black liquid can
be filtered if desired to obtain all the Chlorate.<br>
 Even in a pH controlled cell with low erosion it is next to impossible to make Potassium Chlorate that is snow white unless you add a large volume of water to the cell contents after the cell run has finished,  in order to dissolve all the K Chlorate, so that settling of Graphite is possible. Filtering hot solutions of K Chlorate is next to impossible as the K Chlorate will precipitate on/in the filter.   With pH controlled cells the produced K Chlorate could be used after a washing if the  amount of black discoloration can be tolerated.<br>

<p>
Graphite will get eroded far far too much if it is used to make Perchlorate.<br>
There is an old patent from 1918 using a <a href="div_cell.html">divided cell</a> which was tried but did not work.<br>
See <a href="grapper.html"> here</a> for an attempt to manufacture Perchlorate using Graphite in a normal cell.
