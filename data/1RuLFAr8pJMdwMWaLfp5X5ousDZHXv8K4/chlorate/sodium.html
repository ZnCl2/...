<font size=7 >S</font>odium Chlorate is the Chlorate that is 
mass produced by industry in tonnage quantities.<br> Its main use is in the making 
of ClO<SMALL>2</SMALL> (Chlorine Dioxide gas) for bleaching in the paper 
industry and others. Industrial setup's use a continuous method of making 
Chlorate as opposed to a batch process. The Amateur will usually use a batch process.
 <BR>The starting material is NaCl (Sodium Chloride or common salt). 
About 330 grams NaCl per liter of water is 
the starting solution.

 A 
saturated solution is OK, which can be made by heating the water and adding 
excess salt. When no more salt is dissolving, cool, and you will then have a 
saturated solution. Getting the NaCl to dissolve can be difficult but heating 
helps, not because the solubility of NaCl increased much with increase in 
temperature, but rather the heating stirs the solution. There is some information on Chloride solutions <A href="nacl.html">here</A> and <A href="salt_table.pdf">here</A>.<BR>
The wanted product, Sodium Chlorate, is very soluble. 


<P>Exactly what procedure you follow when making Sodium Chlorate is up to you. It depends on the Anode materials that you have available
and  on what Chlorate (or Perchlorate) salt  that you ultimately want. <br>
If you are ultimately going  to make 
Sodium Perchlorate you may decide to separate the Chlorate and Perchlorate steps 
by separating out the Sodium Chlorate and then using this Chlorate in another 
cell to make Perchlorate. 
 You may decide not to separate  the Chlorate and 
Perchlorate stages (labour saving) and simply keep running your cell without 
separating out the Chlorate as per US patent 3,493,478 (see the Sodium 
Perchlorate section). 
 You need a Lead Dioxide Anode to run from Chloride all the way to Perchlorate as wear rates ($$$)
on Platinum may be too high.<br>
This is not a sensible way to proceed IMO and the Chlorate and Perchlorate stages are better seperated.  <br>
If you have enough evaporation from the cell you can run a continous process by adding NaCl solution to the cell. The Na Chlorate will crystallize out when the 
concentration gets high enough and can be lifted out if Anode erosion products are not too much of a problem.
<P>If you are making Potassium Chlorate (from the Sodium Chlorate) you can simply run your cell for the 
required run time and take out a crop of Potassium Chlorate by adding KCl and start 
running the cell again. Anode erosion products may be a problem.
