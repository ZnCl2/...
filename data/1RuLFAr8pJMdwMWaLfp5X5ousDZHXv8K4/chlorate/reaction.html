There is not much to be said here that has not been said elsewhere. The reactions that occur inside a 
Chlorate cell are not easy explained by the non-professional to the non-professional. What actually happens, 
how fast it happens and what way it happens depends on a lot of factors including:  pH of bulk 
solution, temperature, concentration of starting, intermediate and end products, stirring of cell 
contents, current density on electrodes and current concentration in the cell, additives in cell, 
ratio of total volume of cell to area of electrodes, spacing and arrangement of electrodes, type 
of electrodes, cell voltage...and more.<BR>
To complicate matters more the effects of each of the parameters cannot be studied in isolation as 
all the parameters interact with one another in a complicated way. You also have the added complication 
of how YOU would like your system to behave. The industrial manufacturer will be very concerned with power consumption. The Amateur will not 
be very concerned. <br>
All theses factors create  a lot of healthy debate.
<P>

It should be noted that the Non-Professional cell will probably be operated at a high pH 
(ie. no pH control). When this is the case, practically all of the Chlorate is made by electricity 
and therefor there will be no chemical conversion of intermediates into Chlorate in the bulk of the
 solution, and therefor the temperature of the bulk solution will be somewhat irrelevant. Also the
 maximum possible current efficiency in this situation is 66.7%<br>
If pH control is to be realised, you will have to set up a system to drop HCl  into the
 cell. Throwing a 'slash' of 10 or 20% HCl into the cell every half day or so is not recommended. Addition of acid at least four times per day and added slowly to the cell is much better.<p>
 One term that gets mentioned in the literature is 'active Chlorine' or 'available Chlorine'. This is a term used to describe all the Chlorine that comprises the sum of concentrations
of Hypochlorous acid, Hypochlorite ion and
dissolved elemental Chlorine. However, at the usual pH
of electrolytic Chlorate production the latter can be neglected.<p>
The diagrams below attempts to show the overall reaction in a simplified manner<BR>

[DIAGRAM OF RELATIVE CONCENTRATION OF SPECIES IN A CHLORATE CELL]" ALIGN = RIGHT> </td><td>
Diagram on left shows the dependency of the concentration of intermediate species in the chlorate cell 
on pH. At a low pH the cell will generate Chlorine gas which will escape out of the cell and this will cause 
the pH to increase. As the pH rises the ease with which Chlorine can escape out of the cell gets less and 
less and the cell will stabilize at a pH of about 9 or 10.
 At this high pH, practically all Chlorate is made by electricity by the Anodic Oxidation of the Hypochlorous
ion (also known as Anodic Chlorate formation, or 'making Chlorate by electricity', or electrochemical Chlorate formation) at a maximum possible current
 efficiency of 66.66%, the nine electron route. Adding acid lowers the pH which will decrease the concentration of the Hypochlorous 
 ion and increase the concentration of the Hypochlorous acid. Thus it will be possible for Chlorate to form
 in the bulk of the solution by these species combining (Chemical Chlorate formation via the 'bulk reactions'), the six electron route.

cells</font></table></center><p>



The pH of the cell increases if you do not add acid to the cell. This is caused by Chlorine gas escaping 
from the cell. As the pH rises up to about 9  or 10 the Chlorine is no longer able to escape and the pH will 
stabilize. <br>
If you want you can control the pH of your cell. This will dramatically increase current efficiency and
 also give much much less erosion if you are using Graphite Anodes. It will decrease erosion on all Anode typed IMO. 
I have seen reports of acid being added to cell every 24 hours in order to control pH. This should be considered a maximum time interval
to use and better to add acid 3 or 4 times daily. Better still to set up a system to drop dilute HCl into the 
 cell.  A pH probe that is permanently immersed in the cell (a pH stat) and that is capable of withstanding cell condition will have a high cost.
The best strategy for the Amateur is to simply drop/pump HCl into the cell at a rate that will hold pH in the wanted region. The pH can be
checked periodically using an standard pH meter.<br>
 
The cell chemistry changes dramatically when the pH is held at the optimum and the optimum cell design
 changes too. When you are controlling pH it is good to have a fairly large bulk of solution in your cell 
 so that there is plenty of space away from the anode for the bulk reactions to take place.   Industrial set up  have two main parts to
 a Chlorate cell. The first part (cool temperature) has the electrodes closely arranged  so that the solution spends minimal 
 time between the electrodes. The solution (now rich in intermediates) flows into a bigger tank where
 bulk reactions take place and this is maintained at a high temperature. <br>
When the cell is pH controlled the  current efficiency goes up as temperature goes up. 
As a rough figure you can expect a 6% increase 
in current efficiency as you increase the temperature of your cell from 30 to 80C.
  <p>
If you are not controlling pH there is little point in having conditions favorable to bulk reactions IMO.
Most of the Chlorate will be made by electricity alone, therefor temperature will not have much effect on 
current efficiency. Note that Magnetite Anodes will not make Chlorate at a sensible CE if there is no pH control.<p>

<p>
As can be seen from the above diagrams and tables, it is very beneficial to operate a pH controlled cell 
  at a high temperature (assuming it will not erode the anode). Not alone does this increase current 
  efficiency directly (by helping the bulk reaction take place) but it also lowers the amount of acid 
  required to produce a given amount of Chlorate.<br>
 It is also beneficial to control the pH accurately. This increases current efficiency directly and it 
 also decreases the total acid requirement for a given amount of Chlorate produced. <br>
The acid requirement for a given amount of Chlorate  produced will go down as  current efficiency goes up.
<br>
With the pH of the cell at the optimum, the quantity of Chlorine escaping from the cell  will be greater 
than a similar cell run at a pH of ~9-10 (pH not controlled). This represents a current loss (ie. some current
 is wasted producing Chlorine for no good reason). It also represents a molar loss.  The extra amount of 
 Chlorine escaping from the cell is very small as can be seen from the graph.<p>
 <hr><br>
Figures from industry vary greatly as to the amount of acid used  per KG Na Chlorate produced with a range from 40 to 110 Kilo of 35% HCl per
Ton of Sodium Chlorate produced (40 to 110 grams 35% HCl per KG Na Chlorate). <BR>
If you assume that a CE of (say) 85% will be achieved in your cell you can calculate the amount of acid to add, per amp per hour, that equates to 
the figures in KG acid per Ton Na Chlorate. The actual figures calculated from the data above give an addition rate of 12% HCl of from 0.062ml to 
0.17ml per amp per hour. (Assuming CE of 85%, density of 12% HCl 1.058g/cc).<br>
Some actual practical figures used in amateur cells are:<br>
<ul>

<li>0.35ml per hour per amp, 12% HCl (Magnetite Anode in a very small Na cell running one amp).<br>
<li>0.13ml per hour per amp, 12% HCl (Graphite Anode in a 2L Na cell running five amps). <br>
<li>0.09ml per hour per amp, 12% HCl (Lead Dioxide Anode with no additive in a 2.3 liter cell running 6 amps).<br>
<li>Quote from Swede: <br><i>
 
HCl: With "T-Cell Jr" (KCl, 19L, 50 amps) I had the dosing timer set up
 to turn on 6 times per day
 for one minute, and each cycle of the dosing pump delivered 12-15 ml, so somewhere around 100 ml
 per day of 21% acid worked. I could probably have added more, the pH was more often than not 
 around 7.5 rather than 6.8, but I was very pleased at the stability. Once it was "forced" down
 to near neutral, there was no tendency to rapidly climb; periodic acid dosing as a concept works, 
 and I believe it is a good alternative to full pH control with an immersed probe, with its 
 associated probe poisoning problems.</i><br>
 [This works out at approx. 0.146ml 12% HCl per amp per hour. An MMO Anode was used.]<p>
 </ul><p>
It would appear that small cells require more acid than larger cells. Also approx. three times more acid is required to keep pH under control  at the start of the cell run, decreasing  to the above 'steady state' amounts after approx. two days. See the Graphite and LD Anode sections for some examples of pH controlled cells. When Chloride level gets to approx. 50 to 40 grams per liter the pH will stay around the wanted band without any addition of acid. This may be a useful indication of the end of the cell run.<br>
 Note that if a large excess of acid is added to the cell it will produce large amounts of Chlorine gas
 which may be a danger. Bear this in mind and set up pumping so that only a certain maximum of acid can enter 
 cell should the timer malfunction and/or use good ventilation. <br>
Various schemes have been suggested for adding acid to cells. A pump and timer as above is good or a small reservoir and a solenoid on a timer would suffice. There are some simple gravity systems <a href="hclscheme.gif">here</a>.<br>

 <font size=6>Reaction equations and cell chemistry in the Perchlorate cell</font>

All the reactions in a Perchlorate cell take place at 
the surface of the electrodes with no 'bulk' reactions taking place. The overall reaction can be describes thus:<br><center><big>
<b> ClO<small>3</small><sup>-</sup> + H<small>2</small>O =====> ClO<small>4</small><sup>-</sup> + 2H </b></big>   (2 Electrons are needed)<br></center><p>
<br>
The two most usual reactions at the Anode can best be described by quoting from the JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY 17 (1987) page 45 <p>
<i>
".............the mechanism of Anodic oxidation 
of (Sodium) Chlorate to Perchlorate on Ti substrate Beta Pb02 Anodes involves the Anodic oxidation of water in a 
one-electron transfer step to give an adsorbed (OH) radical as the rate-determining step. Perchlorate 
ion is produced by a subsequent fast oxidation step involving either the Chlorate ion or an adsorbed 
Chlorate radical and the adsorbed (OH) radical. Schematically, this may be illustrated as follows:" </i>
<p><center>
<img border=2 src=perk_mech.gif><p></center>
(Note: ad = adsorbed = to form a thin film (on electrode surface))
<p>

Hydrogen is produced at the Cathode. Very little unwanted reactions (Chlorate or Perchlorate being destroyed) occur at the Cathode. Quoting from the above study (page 39)<i><br>
"It was established that Cathodic Hydrogen evolution occurred at 100% 
current efficiency during the electrolysis of NaCI0<small>3</small> + NaCI0<small>4</small> solutions. In other words, the 
Cathodic reduction of Perchlorate to Chlorate, or of Chlorate to Chloride does not take place to any 
significant extent. The assay of the solution before and after electrolysis for Chloride, Chlorate and 
Perchlorate confirmed these conclusions." </i><br>
One unwanted reaction that occurs at the Cathode when making Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba Perchlorates is the metal Hydroxide depositing on the Cathode and causing current to stop flowing.
<p>
The study quoted above used a Lead Dioxide Anode. According to another study, [JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY 25 (1995) 126-136
<i>Mechanism of Anodic Oxidation of Chlorate to Perchlorate on Platinum electrodes]</i>, the mechanism for Perchlorate formation at a Pt Anode is the same as the first mechanism (above the blue 'OR') depicted in the reactions above.<br><p>
One further reaction route that can occur, (according to JAE 22 page 879, See Mg Perk. section) when the electrolyte is highly alkaline, is:<p> <center><big><b>
(ClO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>ad</sub> + OH<sup> -</sup> ===>  ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> + H<sup>+</sup> + e<sup>-</sup>
</center></b></big><p><br>
The main problem with Perchlorate production is that Oxygen is also produced (evolved) at the Anode as an unwanted reaction and wastes current (and erodes Anodes). The theoretical reaction Voltages for the wanted reactions and the O<small>2</small> evolution reaction are close. The rate of the wanted reactions increase more that the rate of the Oxygen evolution reaction as the Anode current density (Anode potential) is increased so that Perchlorate production goes up as Anode current density goes up. The (OH)<small>ad</small> seems to form a film on the Anode at high Anode CD which reduces O<small>2</small> evolution. Sodium Fluoride (and other additives) are sometimes used to increase the Anode potential for Oxygen evolution so that less Oxygen is produced. <BR>
Ozone is also produced at the Anode when Chlorate concentration gets low.<br>
To keep CE high you need a high concentration of Chlorate in the cell which does not suit Amateur one-off batch runs.<br>
The current efficiency also increases as the ionic strength  of the solution increases (higher concentrations of salts) but not by a large factor. There is an advantage to having both high Chlorate and high Perchlorate concentrations in the cell. This also does not suit the Amateur who will probably run a single cell from start (high Chlorate concentration and zero Perchlorate concentration) to completion (low Chlorate concentration and high Perchlorate concentration) and start again with a fresh new Perchlorate cell. This may have some implications for production of Potassium Perchlorate directly from K Chlorate as the solubilities are lower that the Sodium salts.<br><p>

<h3>pH control of Sodium Perchlorate cell</h3><p>

The current efficiency of Sodium Perchlorate cells is not dependent on pH. Commercials Perchlorate cells are pH controlled and this may be for reasons regarding Anode or equipment corrosion. Keeping pH low will also help if there is a problem with Hydroxides sticking to Cathodes which occures when makiing some types of Perchlorates). Remember the only way to control the pH of a Perchlorate cell without adding Chloride is to use Perchloric acid (to reduce pH). NaOH or KOH can be used to increase pH. Na Perchlorate cells that are not pH controlled, drift to a pH in the region of 11 and stay there.<br>

As a cell progresses from a pH controled Chlorate cell into a Perchlorate cell the acid demand drops to zero when the point of approx. 30 grams per liter Chloride is reached.The cell then stays around neutral for some time and then rises to a high pH. It takes large amounts of HCl to keep cell neutral at this point (there is no point in doing it anyways). When the cell becomes a Perchlorate cell proper the addition of Chloride will cause the pH to rise to a high level and it cannot be controlled in any sensible fashion. (there is no point in doing it anyways). The addition of HCl acid only makes things worse by causing the pH to rise as you are adding Chloride when adding HCl acid. If you want to run a Perchlorate cell at a low pH you should wait untill all Chloride has gone and then add SMALL amounts of HCl (or better Perchloric acid) to take the pH down.<br>
Using Perchloric acid to lower pH does not cause the problems associated with HCl acid. You could also use Sulphuric acid and perhaps have the added advantage of Sulphate improving %CE as described in a paper somewhere.
There is an account of attempting to control the pH of a Perchlorate cell using HCl acid in the Lead Dioxide Anode section (MMO substrate). It has been claimed in a paper that Lead Dioxide Anodes were observed to dissolve at high pH. I have never seen this happening though adding Chloride to Perchlorate cells seems to erode Lead Dioxide Anodes as brown froth starts to appear on the cell surface.  <p>
The pH of Barium Perchlorate cells (and probably other rare earths) has an effect on current efficiency. See the Ba Perchlorate section.<p>

<table width="100%" bgcolor=#9900cc><tr><td align=center><font size=7> Cell additives</font></table></center><p>
Various additives are used in  the Sodium Chlorate and Perchlorate cell.<br>
Sodium Dichromate is the main additive used in industrial Chlorate cells. It is not suitable for use with Lead Dioxide. It has several roles.<br>
<ul>
<li>Helps prevent corrosion of Fe Cathodes.<br>
<li>Helps to buffer the electrolyte in the pH range 5 to 7 (pH control used).<sup>&nbsp;</sup><br>
<li>Inhibits Oxygen evolution at the Anode.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>
<li>Suppresses ClO<sup>-</sup> and ClO<small>3</small><sup>-</sup> reduction reactions by forming a Cr<small>3</small>O<small>4</small> film on the Cathode. It effectively raises the cd on the Cathode. <br>
<li>Supresses Perchlorate formation at high Chlorate concentrations in the Chlorate cell. (according to JAE 1 (1971) 207-212)<sup>&nbsp;</sup>
</ul>
Dichromate lowers CE in the Perchlorate cell with both Pt and LD Anodes but not by a drastic amount.(JES 116 No. 1 page 150)<br>
Fluoride in the form of Sodium Fluoride plays a similar role to Chromate and is compatible with  Lead Dioxide. Fluorine also raises the Oxygen over-potential at the Anode 
(less Oxygen gets produced) giving greater CE in both Chlorate and Perchlorate production. Titanium Substrate Lead Dioxide Anodes can have any bare Ti etched but F does not damage the Anode proper. It raised %CE to a level where it is well worth adding.<br>
 MMO Anodes can be damaged by Fluoride containing electrolyte, therefor  Fluoride  is not recommended when using MMO. Fluoridated water has very little Fluoride in it and appears to give no problems but it is probably best to avoid it as it may  cause problems with MMO Anodes.<br>
Persulphate and Sulphuric acid  is also said to increase CE with Lead Dioxide in Perchlorate cells.<br>
Yttrium is also stated to have a similar role to Chromate and is not toxic  (Thesis of Linda Nylén).<br>
Sodium Molybdate is also  a possible alternative to Sodium Dichromate. (Journal of Applied Electrochem, Volume 37, Number 4 / April, 2007)<br>
Another patent (Google PCT/EP2006/069079) describes using Phosphates in conjunction with  Fe-Mo alloy coated Cathodes for buffering electrolyte and to stop Cathodic reduction thus eliminating Chromates.<br>
<b>
Chlorate cells that have been run by Amateur operators have shown that additives do not contribute a  large increase in CE and can be left out ('green cells') without any great consequence so long as Cathodes have a sensibly large current density when working (keep above 60mA per square cm, see Cathode section). </b>
