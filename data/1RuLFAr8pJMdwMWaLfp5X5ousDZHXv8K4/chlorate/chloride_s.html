<h2>Chloride Indicator strips</h2>

The following is from Swede's blog on APCFORUMS.<BR>

</DIV><BR><BR>If you go for these, be sure to get the high-range 
      strips, which test between 0.2g to 6.0 grams / liter. The first step, for 
      me at least, was to verify that the strips are reasonably accurate, and do 
      in fact work. At less than a buck a strip, I don't mind "wasting" a couple 
      to get the hang of their use. <BR><BR>I decided first to prepare a 
      mid-range salt solution. My beaker was 40 ml; 0.12 grams of NaCl dissolved 
      in 40 ml should create a 3g/l standard solution. <BR><BR>

      border=0>

</DIV><BR><BR>The strip is inserted and allowed to remain in the 
      test solution. The column is silver nitrate based; some sort of brown 
      powder or gel. At the top of the test strip is what appears to be a simple 
      yellow nylon string which is soaked in some sort of indicator. 
      Immediately, a much lighter tan color begins to creep up the strip. Hach 
      calls it "white" - regardless, the color change is very obvious. When the 
      moisture reaches the yellow string, it rapidly changes to a brown color, 
      and the test is complete at that point.<BR><BR>
      <DIV align=center>

</DIV><BR><BR>As another test, I noted the level of the tan 
      color, but left the strip in the solution to see if it would continue to 
      rise. It did not, which is pretty interesting to me. There is plenty of 
      chloride ion remaining in the beaker, and I would have supposed that the 
      color change would have continued until all of the silver nitrate 
      indicator had been converted to silver chloride. The fact that the color 
      only went so far, and no further, is a sign of a good, reliable strip 
      titration mechanism.<BR><BR>The standard solution yielded a peak of 5.2 on 
      the test strip, and that correlates to 1787 mg/L chloride ion which does not seem close. The stock solution is 
      3000mg/L" But that is 3 grams of SALT, not chloride ion. Chloride is 61% 
      of NaCl, so 3.0 X (0.61) = 1830 mg/L.<BR><BR>Stock solution: 1830 
      ppm<BR>Strip: 1787 ppm<BR><BR>YES!! Very nice and well within the errors 
      of this simple test.<BR><BR><B>On to the used electrolyte from the 
      chlorate cell. </B>I knew the concentration of the liquor was well beyond 
      the range of these test strips. The simple answer is accurate dilution of 
      the test sample. 10 ml of the liquor was diluted to 100 ml using distilled 
      H2O.<BR><BR>
      <DIV align=center>

</DIV><BR><BR>The dilted test solution was placed in a small 
      beaker, and once again, a test strip was inserted. The titration was 
      rapid, and I was unsure if the dilution was adequate. When the yellow 
      string turned brown, the white band peaked at 8.9, which was above the 
      high-end of the strip. Even though a bit of brown remained, the label on 
      the strip bottle stops at 8.0, which indicates anything above that is 
      probably not valid.<BR><BR>Another sample was dilted 20:1, and this sample 
      peaked at 7.8, still a bit high. I wanted the peak to be a bit lower. The 
      sample was again cut in half, now to 40:1. This one worked perfectly. Here 
      are all of the tests, from left to right, the NaCl standard, and dilutions 
      10:1, 20:1, and 40:1<BR><BR>
      <DIV align=center>

<IMG src="tcic10.jpg" border=0>

</DIV><BR><BR>The scale is NOT linear, thus the 40:1 sample is 
      not 1/2 of the 20:1 sample. The strip bottle reveals these Cl- ion 
      concentrations:<BR><BR><B>20:1 = 7.8 = 5512 mg/L<BR>40:1 = 5.8 = 2288 
      mg/L</B><BR><BR>Again, 7.8 is too high on the test strip, and enters a 
      region of inaccuracy. The 40:1 dilution was right in the heart of the test 
      range, and with test strips like this, as opposed to a true titration, you 
      want to be in the middle, and not at the extremes.<BR><BR><B>Now, for the 
      conclusion,</B> and the primary reason I'm doing this, <I><B>what is the 
      chloride ion concentration in the used electrolyte from my cell? 
      </B></I>Remember, we want the chloride ion concentration to be 10% or 
      greater in a chlorate cell... <BR><BR><!--sizeo:3--><SPAN 
      style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 100%"><!--/sizeo--><B>2288 mg/L X 40 
      = 91.5 g/L for the used electrolyte. 
      </B><!--sizec--></SPAN><!--/sizec-->So I was just a bit lower than 10%. 
      it's a good thing I halted the chlorate production where I did.<BR><BR>The 
      solubilities of salts of interest are...<BR><BR>Salt: 0 deg - 100 
      deg<BR><BR>KCl: 0238 - 0567<BR>KClO<SUB>3</SUB>: 0071 - 
      0570<BR>KClO<SUB>4</SUB>: 0008 - 0218<BR><BR>NaCl: 0357 - 
      0391<BR>NaClO<SUB>3</SUB>: 0790 - 2300<BR>NaClO<SUB>4</SUB>: 2090 - 
      2840<BR><BR>A saturated KCl solution on a hot summer day, at maybe 40 
      degrees celcius, is probably about 350 grams per liter, of which slightly 
      less than half is chloride, call it 47.5% chloride ion by weight, so a 
      saturated KCl starting electrolyte would be 166 grams/L 
      chloride.

<BR><BR><B>Future use of the test 
      strips:</B> These strips serve two purposes. The first use is to monitor 
      the chloride concentration in a cell. With 100 g/L being the minimum 
      chloride ion concentration, a 40:1 dilution of the electrolyte should not 
      be allowed to fall below 2500 mg/L, which is 6.0 on the strip. The second 
      use, to come later, is to test dissolved samples of the final product to 
      determine remaining chloride, which, while not dangerous, could wash out 
      colors.<BR><BR>
