<H1>11. LEAD DIOXIDE ON INERT BASIS ANODE </H1>

<H2>Manufacture of Electrodes</H2>

<P>Almost all methods for the manufacture of electrodes are based on electrode
position of the lead dioxide from a bath containing its salts. Diirkes,
in German Patent 2,259,821, describes a thermal method for making a lead-coated
electrode, the lead being subsequently oxidized to lead dioxide. The patent
describes the application of a paste of ferrous or zinc chloride and powdered
quartz and lead, followed by a drying and then a firing at 6OWC. But apart
from this example, all other methods described here are electrochemical.
We shall, for reasons which will become apparent, discuss graphite-based
anodes separately. Unless otherwise mentioned, all the coatings described
here, derived as they are from acid baths, are preponderantly of the <I>b</I>
-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> variety. much more limited amount of work has been done
on the preparation and behaviour of <I>a</I>-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> coatings.
</P>

<H3>PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/graphite anodes</H3>

<P>The important earlier patents are D.A.S. 1,182,211 and U.S. 2,945,791
(1960) and D.A.S. 1,496,962 (1966), all from the Pacific Engineering Corp.
The second of these specifies addition of a surface-active agent (such
as alkyl phenoxy polyoxethylene ethanol type) to reduce gassing, increase
throwing power and give a more compact deposit. Nitric acid is also stated
to give better throwing power. The stepwise reduction in current density
is mentioned in both the first and the second of these patents. All the
Pacific patents are characterized by details of &quot;bath management&quot;
which are trivial on the laboratory scale, but become crucial when plating
on an industrial scale. Typical bath composition from the earlier patents
might then be: lead nitrate, 50-400 g L<SUP>-1</SUP>; copper nitrate trihydrate,
0-20 g l<SUP>-1</SUP> nickel nitrate trihydrate, I 0 g l<SUP>-1</SUP>;
sodium fluoride, 0- 5 g L<SUP>-1</SUP>; surface active agent, 0-7S g L<SUP>-1</SUP>;
nitric acid, 0-4 g L<SUP>-1</SUP>; and pH = 1.5. This bath is operated
at 45-70<SUP>o</SUP>C at currents which may be constant (e.g. 25 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP>)
or increase or decrease during the plating. The fluoride ions may serve
to etch the oxides present on graphite. The patent D.A.S. 1,496,962 somewhat
amplifies the question. The nickel is stated to act as a grain-size refiner
the copper to prevent deposition (and thus depletion) of lead on the cathode.
This it does presumably by reducing the overvoltage for hydrogen evolution
at the cathode. (Wabner<SUP>41</SUP> has tested PbO<SUB>2 </SUB>deposits
for the presence of metals such as Cu or Ni and finds no detectable traces.)
This patent also claims advantages in the maintenance of the level of dissolved
iron below 0- 02 g L<SUP>-1</SUP></P>

<P>Further reading shows that in D.A.S. 1,496,962 (which is equivalent
more or less to U.S. Patent 3,463,707), the emphasis is on removal of iron(to
less than 0.02 g L<SUP>-1</SUP>) and chlorides, and obviating the need
to use the relatively costly Ni and Cu salts previously employed. These
baths thus contained only sodium fluoride and nitric acid, apart from the
lead nitrate at a concentration of 200 g l<SUP>-1</SUP> . Thangappan and
Nachippan<SUP>6</SUP> describe the benefits to be obtained by deposition
of the PbO<SUB>2</SUB> in a bath filled with fluidized inert particles,
i.e. one in which the mass transport of species has been enhanced compared
with normal conditions. A much smoother deposit is claimed. Huss and Wabner<SUP>7
</SUP>use paraffin-filled graphite and evacuate it before deposition, to
ensure absence of gases, while Narasimham<SUP>8</SUP> describes electrolytic
pretreatment of graphite in alkali with a 24-h &quot;soak&quot; period.
Little has been published in the PbO<SUB>2</SUB>-graphite area, although
an interesting glass-fibre/PbO<SUB>2</SUB> composite &quot;sleeve&quot;
to fit graphite rods has been described.&quot; Graphite is anisotropic
in its electrical conductance, and Wabner&quot; suggests this may lead
to poor current distribution and thus increased corrosion. He also states
that the graphite is capable of being &quot;burnt&quot; by the PbO<SUB>2</SUB>,
i.e. oxidized, and reports that this can lead with time to formation of
a void between the graphite and the inner surface of the PbO<SUB>2</SUB>
(which would presumably in any case be reduced). This constitutes another
reason (according to him) why such anodes are comparatively short-lived,
although the &quot;Pepcon&quot; commercial anodes are stated to last for
2 years approximately when fitted in hypochlorite cells. Narasimham and
Udupa,<SUP>48</SUP> in their recent and excellent paper reviewing preparation
and uses of these anodes, do not support the views of Wabner. In their
work, they describe how anodes in rod (75 cm long, 20 cm diam.) or plate
(90 cm X 18 cm x 2 cm) form behave, lasting for as long as 2 years. Although
these authors conclude by stating that Ti might be a better substrate,
it is quite clear that graphite-based anodes are a wholly workable proposition.</P>

<H3>Titanium-based anodes</H3>

<P>Although graphite-based anodes are still in use, notably by the Pacific
Engineering Corp. for their chlorate and hypochlorite production, the growth
is now seen to be in titanium-based electrodes which allow thinner and
mechanically superior cell designs. The first mention of these (as distinct
from graphite) was in U.S. Patent 3,463,707 or British Patents 1,189,183
(1970) and 1,159,241 or French Patent 1,534,453. In the entire treatment,
the question of the formation and deleterious effects of the passive oxide
layer must always be borne in mind. As Wabner points out, theconcept of
an electrode based on a Ti (a strongly reducing metal) substrate coated
with 4-valent, highly oxidizing PbO<SUB>2 </SUB>goes against all expectations
of success. The thermal coefficient of expansion of Ti (in contrast to
graphite) is close to that reported for PbO<SUB>2</SUB>, thus minimizing
thermal shock problems.<SUP>50</SUP> While pinholes in the outer PbO<SUB>2</SUB>
layer will not, with these substrates lead to catastrophic corrosion, it
will nevertheless allow a passive film high resistance to spread on the
(Ti) substrate surface beneath the PbO<SUB>2</SUB> layer.</P>

<H3>Electrodeposition on Ti-General</H3>

<P>The above-mentioned problems of deposition, whether anodiccathodic,
on Ti have given rise to several patents aimed at solving the problem.
Thus German Patent 1,170,747 discusses a Cr<SUP>3+</SUP> and F<SUP>-</SUP>
etch bath as pretreatment in electrodeposition, and U.S. Patent 2,734,8
specifies a pickling in 90<SUP>o</SUP>C HClfor 5-15 min with or without
a previous HF/HNO<SUB>3</SUB>etch or a molten NaOH descale bath. U.S. Patent
3,207,6 79calls for anodization of the Ti to a &quot;Yellow colour&quot;
prior to Pb deposition (but with a Pt &quot;flash&quot;).</P>

<H3>Complete Descriptions for Anode Manufacture</H3>

<P>There are dozens of patents describing the best way in which to prepare
PbO<SUB>2</SUB> anodes. There is no way of knowing, in most cases, the
true worth of the ideas proposed, for there is almost no example of performance
or appearance of an anode so prepared compared with one in which the step
was omitted. The best procedure is to detail all the steps, it being understood
that several of these may well be omitted.</P>

<P><I><B>Preliminary cleaning and treatment</B>. </I>We here consider mechanic
abrasion and degreasing. De Nora'suggests sandblasting with fine silica
sand followed by degreasing with benzene-a solvent virtually pro-scribed
in many cases today. Trichloroethylene is now usually specified. They note
that a pre-etch in boiling HCl leads to irregular PbO<SUB>2</SUB> deposition,
with a tendency to cracking. Barrett&quot; suggests that the sandblasting
is vital to ensure a good &quot;keying-in&quot; of PbO<SUB>2</SUB> to the
Ti substrate, and that choice of correct sandblasting conditions is vital.</P>

<P><I><B>Preplating stages</B>. </I>Prior to electrodeposition, almost
all procedure specify some means of removing the titanium oxide (although
as seen above, its formation is also specified). U.K. Patent 1,373,611
specifies a removal by cathodic reduction of the oxide. In theory this
is convenient in that it requires no separate stage but simply a reversal
of electrode polarity, although subsequent work shows H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>
is the best cathodization solution. Most other sources specify an etch
in HCl, HF, NaF or oxalic acid. D.O.S. 2,012,506 specifies 10 min at 25<SUP>o</SUP>C
of a 0.5 m HF/4 m NaF solution, another etch being specified in Belgian
Patent 702,806. A completely different idea is proposed by Wabner et al.<SUP>11</SUP>
They suggest that the deeper scratches which can be seen under the microscope
after mechanical treatment act as latent fault sites, even though they
appear to be evenly.covered over by the lead dioxide. After many hours
operation, these spring open again. Carborundum inclusions, and hollows
with covered patches of oxide, are other sources of failure. These workers
etch for 1h in boiling oxalic acid (15%). After a short time, when the
oxide has been etched away, a violent hydrogen evolution is seen, the metal
dissolving to form a reddish-brown titanium oxalato(III) complex. Figures
7 and 8 show S.E.M. photographs illustrating the &quot;stormy-sea&quot;
effect of this process. In the next stage (to which the authors state they
attach the greatest importance), the electrode, after washing, is boiled
in TI(IV) oxalate and oxalic acid (0.2 m and 1.25 m, respectively). The
authors state that neither with the naked eye nor with the S.E.M. does
this surface show any difference from the one seen after the previous etch.
The effect is only seen after plating. The whole idea is taken from D.O.S.
2,306,957 and it is worth quoting what the authors themselves stress,&quot;
namely, that if the PbO<SUB>2</SUB> deposit is chemically stripped from
a Ti substrate so treated, the &quot;effect&quot; remains and a fresh PbO<SUB>2</SUB>
deposit on that surface constitutes an anode as good as the original one.
Whether this argues in favour of some compound or species formed on the
surface, or simply reflects the physical state of subdivision of the surface,
is not known. We would opt for the latter suggestion. In a somewhat similar
vein, D.O.S. 2,023,292 suggests an intermediate firing process of the Ti
following the application of an aqueous solution of CrCl, or similar compounds
which are listed there.</P>

<P>Wabner&quot; reports many experiments aimed at illustrating the effect
that the TI(IV) pretreatment has on the substrate. For example, even at
60<SUP>o</SUP>C he states that TiO, formation is inhibited in air, in contrast
to the untreated metal. By means of S.E.M. photographs, he shows how the
PbO2 deposits more evenly on treated Ti instead of forming isolated clumps,
and it is suggested that PbO2 growth into fissures is likewise facilitated,
such fissures in their uncovered state being postulated as future electrode-failure
sites. Time-potential plots of Ti in the etch bath and in PBNO, plating
baths all reveal differences in behaviour, and Wabner quotes the work of

Thomas and Nobe@' as well as that of Goldberg and Parry- in showing that
TI(IV) ions inhibit corrosion of the metal apparently by facilitating passivation.
This work is possibly the source of inspiration underlying the TI(IV) pretreatment
concept.</P>

<P>It is impossible to condense here the extensive work of Wabner, much
of which has been published. We do not believe that any organic. compound
could survive prolonged contact with PbO2 without itself undergoing oxidation
and that if the &quot;magic&quot; of the TI(IV) treatment is to be explained,
it lies either in the subsequent decomposition of the oxalato or perchlorate
to form a stable inorganic species such as the titanoplumbate, or in some
effect on the morpbology of the surface. In so far as the performance of
such treated anodes can be matched in every way, as far as can be ascertained,
by well-prepared Ti alone, we opt for the latter suggestion. D.O.S. 2,344,645,
which again raises problems of electrode failure after operation at high
anodic potentials or long terms, seeks to avoid this failure (due to oxide
passivation on the Ti) by creating an interlayer. Plasma-arc spraying of
0- 15-cm thick layers of carbides or borides of Ta or Ti gives a conducting
layer which inhibits oxide formation. A grain size of 40-90 lim is suggested.
Such a suggestion recalls earlier ideas of Beer based on Ti anodes with
a nitride coating (D.A.S. 1,421,047), although irr this case the coating
was intended to be the outer one in contact with solution.</P>

<P><B><I>The electrodeposition process</I></B>. Lead dioxide may be anodically
deposited from a variety of baths. One of the best critical evaluations
of these comes from the work of Hampson and Bushrod.<SUP>12 </SUP>Since
commercially viable depositions must operate at reasonable current densities,
Hampson et al. excluded baths based on fluoborates, plumbites and silicofluorides,
since at current densities above 5 mA cm<SUP>-2,</SUP> these gave highly
stressed, flaky and poorly adherent deposits. Nitrate and perchlorate salts
of lead alone gave satisfactory deposits. With the latter, solutions of
2 M lead perchlorate and 1 M.acid gave good deposits at up to 50 mA cm<SUP>-2,</SUP>
provided the pH did not fall below 0. Acidity was controlled by circulation
of the solution through a bed of PbO. Hampson also reports that lead growths
on the cathode were a problem and that this was minimized by using the
lowest possible currentdensity on the cathode, i.e. having a larger cathode:anode
area ratio. Current efficiencies were approx. 100%. In almost all patents,
the nitrate bath is preferred, possibly because of the explosive hazards
of perchloric acid. Other workers specify pH 1.5-2.5 as the best condition.</P>

<P>Reporting on the nitrate bath, Hampson showed that the major phenomenon&quot;
in the nitrate bath was the build-up of nitrite, which, because it can
be re-oxidized to nitrate at the anode, leads to loss in current efficiency.
A graph shows that deposition efficiency ranges from 100% (nitrate absent)
to less than 20% when 6% of nitrite is present. At higher current densities,
the nitrite is further reduced to ammonium ions. The nitrite levels were
held down by circulation of the electrolyte through Pb<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>4</SUB>
Alternatively, H<SUB>2</SUB>0<SUB>2</SUB> may be added to remove NO<SUB>2</SUB>.
These authors report no effect of temperature in the range 20-40<SUP>o</SUP>C,
although commercially, baths are operated at 6O<SUP>o</SUP>C or higher.
The U.S. Bureau of Mines&quot; reports cracking when deposition takes place
above 70<SUP>o</SUP>C.</P>

<P>Narasimham and Udup<SUP>a18</SUP> have studied the throwing power of
the nitrate bath which they state passes through a maximum, but against
what is unclear. The effect of nitric acid and surface active agents on
throwing power was referred to previously. Oddly very few of the patents
cited here refer to the stress which occurs in electrodeposited PbO<SUB>2</SUB>.
It is again Hampson and Bushrod<SUP>12</SUP> who study this, and their
results are not easy to summarize. Simple nitrate baths gave compressively
stressed deposits.</P>

<P>An equally thorough study of the effect of current density, temperature
and organic additives on stress of deposited on nickel and graphite is
due to Narasimham and Udupa.<SUP>13</SUP> In the later paper they explored
the use of lead acetate as a buffer to relieve stress. Smith&quot; also
discusses the effect of deposition conditions on stress, higher stresses
occurring in more dilute electrolytes. Current density below 70 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP>
had little effect while well-stirred solutions gave stress-force deposits.
Organics, notably sodium acetate, acted most effectively as stress relievers.
Indian workers with much experience in this field appear to lay special
emphasis on CTAB (cetyl trimethylammonium bromide) for stress relief and
a very perfect surface. This has been described,&quot; as has its rate
of loss&quot; by oxidation etc.</P>

<P>Commercial baths operate at 60-70<SUP>o</SUP>C. Wabner <SUP>41</SUP>
states that lower bath temperatures result in anodes giving higher overpotentials
in subsequent use (for example, for oxygen evolution) and this probably
results from the higher overpotentials obtained during the deposition process
at lower temperatures and so there is thicker TiO<SUB>2</SUB> film formation.
All contain approx. 200 g l<SUP>-1</SUP> lead nitrate. Some have 10 ml
conc. HNO, l<SUP>-1</SUP>, others contain copper and/or nickel salts as
described earlier. De Nora (U.K. Patent 1,192,344) operates at 300g l<SUP>-1</SUP>
lead nitrate and 3 g l<SUP>-1</SUP> copper salts with 0.92 g l<SUP>-1</SUP>
&quot;'Tergitol&quot; (a sodium alkyl sulphate), and uses 250 A dm<SUP>-2</SUP>
current density. Bath compositions designed to produce correctly stressed
anodes (for primary batteries) are discussed in U.K. Patent 1,340,914.
It is pointed out that stress can be relieved by heating the finished electrode
in air and allowing it to cool slowly. The 360 g l<SUP>-1</SUP> nitrate
solution is unbuffered at pH 3-4 and no other bath constituents are used
except in one example where a two-stage deposit was built up, the inner
one as above and the outer one with a lead acetate/sodium nitrate bath.
(It should be pointed out that both this patent and Hampson's work cited
above relate to depositions on nickel. However, the findings are probably
of general applicability.) U.K. Patent 1,373,611 uses a bath with additions
of Cu, Ni salts, free nitric acid, sodium fluoride and heptafluobutanol
operating at 70<SUP>o</SUP>C, and uses a two-step deposition rate, the
first 20 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP> the second 60 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP>.</P>

<P>Among other ideas and suggestions we can include (frequently unspecified
benefits) are D.O.S. 2,012,506 (effects of 010gg l<SUP>-1</SUP> </P>

<P>urea addition), D.O.S. 2,306,957 (the laying down of two discrete PbOz
layers, the outer one harder than the inner one), the effect of current
interruption on PbO@ structure, and the use of glass beads in the plating
bath to avoid pitting due to oxygen bubble entrapment.&quot; The importance
of stirring or agitating the bath is universally stressed. One paper uses
a fluidized (silica) bed to improve quality and uniformity of deposits.'
In spite of the widespread use of nitrate baths, advocates exist for other
baths, for example, Lazarev<SUP>34</SUP> finds H<SUB>2</SUB>SiF<SUB>6</SUB>+
CH<SUB>3</SUB>COOH as good as the nitrate bath -, a similar bath has been
advocated, while sulphamate baths have also been patented.<SUP>36</SUP></P>

<P>Miscellaneous work on deposition. Ghosh<SUP> 16</SUP> has studied the
effect of various levels of superimposed a.c. on the d.c. used for electro-deposition
of the lead dioxide. Certain differences are noted in the case of deposition
of <I>a</I>-forms but no significant changes are seen during deposition
of the, <I>B</I>-form. A series of Soviet papers describe lead dioxide
deposition from trilonate (EDTA) baths.<SUP>17</SUP> However, no indication
is given as to the benefits so obtained, although the work is thorough
in respect of stress measurement etc.</P>

<P>Narasimham et al<SUP>.29</SUP> have studied the effect of cathode geometry
on the mode of deposition (mainly thickness) of the PbO<SUB>2</SUB> at
the anode.</P>

<P>Wabner@' maintains that deposition using ultrasonic probes results in
a2OO-300 mV lower overvoltage for oxygen evolution when the electrode is
in service.</P>

<P>Glassy PbO<SUB>2</SUB>. Wabner&quot; has reported the formation of a
&quot;glassy&quot; variation of PbO<SUB>2</SUB>. It is formed by deposition
from a conventional nitrate type bath to which has been added some Ti(IV).
The precise formula is given as follows: 2.5 ml of TiCl, are hydrolysed
in 300 ml distilled water, neutralized with NH<SUB>3</SUB> and the hydroxide/oxihydrate
so formed is well washed with water. It is then redissolved in HNO<SUB>3</SUB>(10
ml) and allowed to stand at 20<SUP>o</SUP>C overnight. Finally 66 g of
lead nitrate are added, the solution is made up to 200 ml (corresponding
to I N lead nitrate) and clarified with active charcoal. The deposition
takes place at 40 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP> and at 20<SUP>o</SUP>C. It was shown
that the glassy deposit was <I>a</I>-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> of the &quot;Plattnerite&quot;
form (in fact without any of the traces of <I>a</I> -PbO<SUB>2</SUB> normally
found) and that the grain size was approx. 600 A in contrast to the 6000
A of normally prepared deposits. Thus methods such as S.E.M. failed to
resolve any structure in such deposits at X 10,000 magnification. These
are highly stressed and, after standing in water, or presumably in service,
the morphology changes and visible crystalline structure begin to develop.
The alkaline &quot;tempering&quot; process described elsewhere also has
the same effect after 12 h. This interesting form of the dioxide may well
find certain uses in analytical applications-for example, where its low
specific surface area gives the benefits normally associated with polished
and smooth metals, and where its apparent lack of long-term stability is
less important.</P>

<P><B><I>Post-treatment of anodes.</I></B> Wabner and Fritz&quot; describe
an electrochemical post-treatment consisting of cyclic voltammetry between
+ 700 mVand +2280 mV. The effects of this are apparent to the naked eye
(colourchange from light grey to brownish-black) while an S.E.M. examination
(as shown in this work) depicts a change from smooth rounded contours of
the immediately formed anode to the mass of needles after the formation.
A further cycling, this time between the more anodic limits of 1650 mV
to 2350 mV is stated to give a more reproducible electrode for kinetic
measurements.</P>

<P>We have already described the effects of heating electrodes in air to
remove strain in the deposit. A similar proposal is found i D.O.S. 2,306,957
where the coated anode is suspended in weak hot alkali for a period of
time.</P>

<P>Regeneration of anodes. As they become more widely used, methods of
regenerating older anodes, removing the coating and corrosion products
and redepositing fresh PbO<SUB>2</SUB> will become available. To date,
the only reference appears to be a Japanese procedure&quot; for boiling
the anodes in nitric and oxalic acid mixtures.</P>

<P>The form of the anode. The traditional graphite-based anodes were and
still are rods of 2-10 cm diameter. Adhesion of the coating to these was
usually good. The advent of metallic substrates posed problems. Attempts
to deposit the dioxide on continuous expanses of flat section lead to progressive
failure, even when the initial defect is only localized. Expanded mesh
has proved to be an ideal form on which to coat PbO<SUB>2</SUB> while another
idea described in a U.S. Bureau of Mines report&quot; and in D.O.S. 2,012,506
is to drill holes in flat sheet at regular intervals. The lead dioxide,
with its good throwing power, deposits into and behind these holes and
anchorage is thereby provided. Another comment made by several workers
is the importance of avoiding sharp edges and corners on the form to be
coated. If these are present, nodular growths of lead dioxide will form
there.</P>

<H4><I>Deposition of alpha -PbO2</I></H4>

<P><I>T</I>he foregoing description of anode preparation relate to coatings
which consist predominantly of <I>B</I>-phase PbO<SUB>2.</SUB> Little has
been written concerning the deposition or behaviour of the a-phase although
it is known to exhibit a lower oxygen overvoltage. Ruetschi<SUP>25</SUP>
describes the deposition of <I>a</I>-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> on Pt. A detailed
description of an <I>a</I>-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> deposition bath is also given
by Grigger<SUP>19</SUP> using alkaline lead tartrate. However, the work
reported by Grigger<SUP>19</SUP> in fact relates to nitrate (e.g. ,<I>B</I>-phase)
deposits. Lartey<SUP>26</SUP> describes the formation of a very ductile
but thin coating of <I>a</I> -PbO<SUB>2</SUB> which is of good adherence
and is black, shiny and &quot;slippery&quot;, apparently having been deposited
in laminae which flake off when a given thickness is exceeded. The Faradaic
efficiency of the deposition, even at 5 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP>was c. 30%. Carr
and Hampson<SUP>27</SUP> have also reviewed baths for alpha phase deposition
while Issa et al.<SUP>28</SUP> have prepared deposits of mixed <I>a</I>-
and <I>B</I>-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> (92%, 80% and 60% <I>a</I>-phase) using formaldehyde
as a reductant in th edeposition bath. The study of Gancy<SUP>30</SUP>
covers both Faradaic efficiency and also stoichiometry, as well as other
details. Clarke <SUP>31</SUP> states that during or after PbO<SUB>2</SUB>
deposition from alkaline baths, some sort of luminescence is observed and
that deposits exhibit a high degree of preferred orientation.</P>

<P>Recently, Soviet workers have patented a bath based on acetone (6-8
g <SUP>L-1</SUP>), urea (3-5 g L<SUP>-1</SUP>) and lead acetate (7-13 gL<SUP>-1</SUP>)
in a 30-5O g L<SUP>-1</SUP> NaOH solution.<SUP>37</SUP></P>

<H3>Scientific Studies of Lead Dioxide on Inert Basis Anode</H3>

<P>In spite of the many recipes for their preparation, few studies of the
completed article exist. Largely for this reason, it is very difficult
to evaluate the comparative merits of the various means of preparation.</P>

<P>Metallographic (S.E.M.) studies of surface textures are reported by
Wabner<SUP>7,11,41 </SUP>and in the U.S. Bureau of Mines study;<SUP>15</SUP>
X-ray analysesof composition (85% <I>B</I>-phase, 15% <I>a</I>-phase) are
cited in Belgian Patent 702,806 and also by Wabner and Fritz.<SUP>11</SUP>
Rusin<SUP>51</SUP> shows how the <I>a </I>: <I>B</I> ratios vary with PbNO<SUB>3</SUB>
concentration and current density. A very fine study of the kinetics of
deposition<SUP>15</SUP> of <I>a</I>-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> is reported by Fleischmann
and Liler<SUP>20</SUP> and this is only one of a series of fundamental
studies devoted to the electrocrystallization process by Fleischmann.<SUP>22,23
</SUP>A more recent kinetic study of the electrodeposition and cathodic
reduction of PbO<SUB>2</SUB> on conductive tin oxide is due to Laitinen
and Watkins.<SUP>24</SUP> The best physical study of (electrical) properties
of the PbO<SUB>2</SUB> is probably that of Mindt.<SUP>21</SUP> Among his
more important findings are the increase in resistivity with time (over
12 days) and the effect of loss of oxygen on this. Also the fact that resistivity
of the a -phase is greater than that of the <I>B</I>-phase, by an order
of magnitude (p<SUB>B</SUB> = 10<SUP>-2 </SUP>fl cm, p<I>a</I> = 10<SUP>-3</SUP>
fl cm). In terms of the composite PbO<SUB>2</SUB>-TiO<SUB>2</SUB>, anode,
Wabner points out that <I>B</I>-PbO<SUB>2</SUB> and TiO<SUB>2</SUB> are
isomorphous (rutile) differing only by 7% in lattice size and that formation
of a mixed crystal might be possible. This can be considered both in the
context of the Pb-Ti interface and the binding processes there and also
in the context of a &quot;modified&quot; PbO<SUB>2</SUB> + TiO<SUB>2</SUB>
anode along the lines mentioned above. However, such an electrode could
not, one feels; be made by purely electrodeposition processes. </P>

<P>Wabner also speculates as to the possible existence of other compounds
in the system. He mentions lead titanates or titanoplumbates, and the importance
of such species, which have been referred in the literature <SUP>42 </SUP>remains
to be resolved.* He quotes the work of Haufe et al<SUP>.47</SUP> who show
that the electrical conductance of TiO<SUB>2</SUB> can be readily increased
by several orders of magnitude when certain other oxides are added and
this fact again may or may not be relevant to making better composite anodes.
A range of TiO<SUB>2</SUB> compositions can also exist with differing electrical
properties.<SUP>52</SUP> Scientifically as opposed to technologically,
Wabner has published more than any other worker on the PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Ti
composite and his writings therefore deserve careful analysis.</P>

<P>His use of a.c. techniques to investigate processes occurring PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Ti
anodes has been criticized (see Chapter 9) and Canagarat and Hampson<SUP>49</SUP>
illustrate some of the pitfalls of this technique.</P>

<P>The basis of his &quot;oxalate&quot; pretreatment is hard to understand
Possibly it does create on the surface of the Ti a monolayer or so of species
which impedes the oxide passivation which might otherwise take place when
the anodic deposition occurs. Randle,<SUP>43</SUP> measure the potential
of the Ti anodes during conventional deposition from nitrate bath onto
simply etched (but otherwise untreated) Ti, notes the when the potential
of deposition is greater than 2.0 V vs N.H.E., the resulting electrode
is useless or has at best a life of a few hours before failure due to high
electrical resistance occurs. Wabner points out that electrodes pretreated
with the oxalato method retain their special advantages even when the PbO<SUB>2</SUB>
is stripped off after some considerable time and redeposited. In view of
the extremely strong oxidizing proparties of PbO<SUB>2</SUB>, it seems
inconceivable that any oxalate remains unoxidized after being so coated.
Wabner believes that attempts obtain current-potential data with PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Ti
anodes are useless because of the large (and possibly indeterminate) iR
drop across the PbO<SUB>2</SUB> interface which he finds impossible to
separate from the overall drop. This may well be so.</P>

<P>The main problem with Wabner's findings is the weight of evidence to
contradict them or at least to restrict their validity. In fact, anodes
manufactured in the first commercially successful place<SUP>,44</SUP> based
on PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Ti with no interlayer or special pretreatment such as
describes, have been operating in hundreds of installations in the U.K.
and elsewhere (mainly in electroflotation plants) with a proven lifetiime
of 2 years or longer. In further apparent contradiction to the assertions
of Wabner,<SUP>44</SUP> the anodes made and sold by Messrs Morgett Electrochemicals
Ltd. are frequently stored in air for extended periods with no known deleterious
effects on their lifetime, instead of leading to early passivation failure
he suggests would take place. It is not possible here to state whether
Wabner's assertions stem from experiences with poorly prepared anodes or
whether the passivation failures he describes occur sooner in his solutions
(2 N -- H<SUB>2</SUB>SO<SUB>4</SUB>) than they do in the chloride- containing
media in which commercial anodes frequently operate Certainly passivation
would occur more easily in the former than in the latter solutions. Wabner's
other suggestion that 100 mA cm-<SUB>2</SUB>is the maximum permissible
current rating on account of temperature rise from ohmic eating in the
interlayer region also appears to be dubious. Electrodes have been operated
by us and others for 20-30 days in chloride media at 400 mA cm<SUP>-2</SUP>
without showing the voltage increase he describes. In conclusion, the TI(IV)
treatment does appear to reduce the rate of Ti passivation, but using properly
prepared electrodes, such a procedure seems unnecessary. A discussion of
corrosion of composite anodes is given on p. 299.</P>

<H4>Future of the PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Metal Anode</H4>

<P>There seems little doubt that the PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/metal (especially
Ti) anode has an important future in the electrochemical process industry
Experience in our own laboratories and elsewhere has shown that a considerable
degree of &quot;know-how&quot; is required before an anode capable of operating
successfully over a long period can be made. Even now, it not clear what
limits the lifetime of anodes, whether build-up of highly resistive films
or simple loss of PbO<SUB>2</SUB> are the main problems. From the large
and diverse &quot;recipes&quot; for their manufacture, it might well be
deduced that none of the elaborate &quot;inter-layers&quot; or pre/post-treatments
are really necessary. Future work will probably therefore proceed in two
directions,. These are:</P>

<P>(i) Study of the importance (or otherwise) of interlayers either</P>

<P>metallic or of TiN or similar compounds.</P>

<P>(ii) Study of mixed oxide coatings Pb<SUB>O</SUB>2-M<SUB>Ox.</SUB></P>

<P>In this respect, the history of the chlorine anode which has evolved
from a Ru<SUB>O</SUB>2 through a RuO<SUB>2</SUB>TiO<SUB>2</SUB> to a RuO<SUB>2</SUB>TiO<SUB>2</SUB>SnO<SUB>2</SUB>
electrocatalyst will undoubtedly be borne in mind. However, Mindt<SUP>21</SUP>
argues that high concentrations of &quot;dopants&quot; will be needed to
cause any significant effects. In this connection, for example, USSR Patent
49S,714 <SUP>40 </SUP>describes the preparation of &quot;resistive materials&quot;
based on PbO<SUB>2</SUB>, Sb<SUB>2</SUB>O, and other oxides. But knowing
that, if well made, simple PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Ti anodes have already a lifetime
of 2 or more years, any improvements will have to show marked benefits
especially if they are difficult to carry out.</P>

<H4>Morphology of the PbO2 Anode</H4>

<P>As should now be obvious, the morphology of the lead dioxide anode can
assume a variety of forms when examined under the optical or scanning electron
microscope. Dr D. Wabner has kindly provided a selection of micrographs
which are shown on the following pages and which represent a typical range
of PbO2 surfaces.</P>

<H5>Corrosion of PbO2/Inert Substrate Anodes</H5>

<P>We have seen elsewhere that the mode of corrosion of PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Pb
anodes takes place basically not at the surface but rather at the Pb(I
1) interlayer between the metal and the fully oxidizing PbO<SUB>2</SUB>.
In the composite anode which forms the subject of this chapter, no such
intermediate valence state exists (at least not as far as we know) and
one would therefore expect such anodes to corrode more slowly, if at all.
They do indeed show much higher corrosion resistance than their PbO<SUB>2</SUB>/Pb
analogues. A recent paper by Lartey&quot; summarizes published data and
shows new corrosion information on these composites. The findings of Lartey
are that corrosion is broadly related in Tafel fashion to the potential
of the anode, and that effects of Cl- concentration are important mainly
in as much as whether or not they &quot;depolarize&quot; the anode. Work
has continued on this aspect of the problem and there are indications that
the rate of corrosion (as shown by Lartey to be more or less constant over
a 2-week period) subsequently declines to reach a lower steadystate value.
Though these are only preliminary findings and subject to confirmation,
it is worth noting that similar effects have been found in long-term sea-water
corrosion tests of platinized titanium or similar precious metal-coated
Ti anodes. An explanation was offered there in terms of a high initial
loss rate due to poorly adherent metal grains on the outer surface of the
anode, which exposed a more strongly adherent layer beneath.</P>

<P>The corrosion products of PbO<SUB>2 </SUB>anodes in laboratory tests
appear to be mainly a powdery suspension of PbO<SUB>2</SUB> which may subsequently
settle out at the bottom of the reaction vessel. This poses a dilemma in
that it is difficult to explain what is in effect a corrosion not involving
any net chemical change in electrochemical (or indeed, chemical) terms.
One alternative explanation can be attributed to purely mechanical attrition
of the PbO<SUB>@</SUB> due, for example, to the scouring effect of bubbles
of gas formed at the electrode, If this is so, it should be possible to
vary the mechanical properties of the deposited dioxide so as to achieve
a mechanically more resistant structure. The means by which this might
be done are obvious from the foregoing pages. There is, however, a less
orthodox explanation which is as follows. It is not widely appreciated
that the evolution of a gas at an electrode surface causes substantial
potential fluctuations at the electrode-electrolyte interface. With a large
electrode, such fluctuations will appear to be averaged out, but there
is no doubt that they do occur, and can be of the order of 0- S V. The
effect of these fluctuations is to reduce the overvoltage of the system
momentarily. It can therefore be postulated that the corrosion protection
afforded by the anodically formed PbO<SUB>2</SUB> is periodically lost
when a portion of the electrode is covered by a bubble. In such a case,
the potential might fall back to the &quot;sulphate&quot; region. More
rapid dissolution would then take place. The dissolved sulphate would,
however, be reoxidized by contact with the anode, to PbO<SUB>2</SUB>, although
under these conditions much of it would not deposit onto the anode in a
mechanically satisfactory fashion. The result would then correspond with
what is seen-a build-up of suspended PbO<SUB>2</SUB> in the solution. Work
is presently under way on several fronts, aimed at the elucidation of this
question.</P>
