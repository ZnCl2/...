     thereafter soaking said porous ceramic substrate in a persulfate solution
     to cause oxidation of the lead oxide so deposited therein and thereon and
     effecting electrolysis in an aqueous lead (II) salt solution by using said
     lead dioxide-coated substrate as the anode and the aqueous solution as the

<HR>
<BR><BR>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>This invention relates to a method for the manufacture of an electrode
     excelling in corrosion-resisting property and having a porous ceramic
     substrate coated with electrodeposited lead dioxide and to the electrode
     manufactured by said method. There are the following three types of lead
     dioxide electrodes known to the art:
<BR><BR>A. The type of electrodes produced by having lead dioxide anodically
     deposited on the surface of a lead substrate.
<BR><BR>B. The type of electrodes formed solely of lead dioxide without using any
     substrate.
<BR><BR>C. The type of electrodes produced by having lead dioxide electrodeposited
     on the substrate of a corrosion-resisting substance other than lead.
<BR><BR>Of these three types, those of types b and c are called electrodeposited
     lead dioxide electrodes and they excel over those of type a in terms of
     corrosion-resisting property. They have already been put to practical use
     as electrodes convenient for the electrolysis of aqueous solutions.
<BR><BR>The electrodeposited lead dioxide electrodes generally available on the
     market include rectangular lead dioxide electrodes devoid of a substrate
     and lead dioxide electrodes possessed of a substrate of graphite, titanium
     or tantalum or a substrate of such metal having the surface thereof plated
     with platinum, gold or silver. At the present, lead dioxide electrodes
     using a titanium substrate are enjoying favorable acceptance in the
     market.
<BR><BR>The electrodeposited lead dioxide electrodes described above have their
     demerits: For example, the type of lead dioxide electrodes using no
     substrate are susceptible to fracture and therefore have their shape and
     dimensions inevitably limited and the type of electrodes using a graphite,
     titanium or tantulum substrate easily sustain cracks. When a crack occurs
     in such an electrode in the course of an electrolytic reaction, the
     solution undergoing the electrolysis penetrates through the crack and
     eventually comes into contact with the underlying substrate, with the
     result that the substrate is corroded by the solution. The crack,
     therefore, has an adverse effect on the service life of the electrode.
<BR><BR>A primary object of the present invention is to provide a method for the
     manufacture of an electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode which
     incorporates a substrate of high corrosion-resisting property and
     therefore permits desired electrolysis to be performed without entailing
     troubles for a long time.
<BR><BR>Another object of the present invention is to provide electrodeposited lead
     dioxide electrodes which enjoy high resistance to corrosion and withstand
     use conditions for a long time.
<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>To accomplish the objects described above, the present invention provides a
     method which comprises soaking a porous ceramic substrate in an aqueous
     led (II) salt solution, then soaking said substrate desirably in an
     aqueous persulfate solution incorporating aqueous ammonia or in an aqueous
     persulfate solution incorporating an alkali metal hydroxide and thereafter
     drying the wet substrate. In consequence of the treatment described above,
     lead dioxide is deposited on the surface and in the porous surface layer
     of the porous ceramic substrate.
<BR><BR>As the next step, electrolysis is effected by using, as the anode, the
     porous ceramic substrate having lead dioxide deposited as mentioned above
     and, as the electrolyte, an aqueous lead (II) salt solution. By this
     electrolysis, a black, fine-grained coat of lead dioxide excellent in
     electroconductivity is additionally formed to coat the lead dioxide layer
     covering the porous ceramic substrate.
<BR><BR>Consequently, there is obtained an electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode
     which is constructed of a ceramic substrate and a layer of lead dioxide
     formed to coat the surface of said ceramic substrate. This electrode has
     excellent electroconductivity. Even if a crack occurs in the coat of lead
     dioxide while the electrode is in use, the electrolysis under way is not
     interrupted by the crack because the ceramic substrate offers perfect
     resistance to the action of the electrolyte.
<BR><BR>BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE DRAWING
<BR><BR>FIG. 1 is an X-ray diffraction diagram indicating the structure of
     electrodeposited lead oxide.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 is an X-ray diffraction diagram indicating the structure of lead
     dioxide deposited by the soaking process.
<BR><BR>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
<BR><BR>A ceramic substance is a very poor conductor of electricity. Therefore,
     lead dioxide cannot be electrodeposited directly on the ceramic substance.
<BR><BR>For the formation of electroconductive films on the surface of ceramic
     articles, there have heretofore been proposed methods resorting to
     techniques such as chemical plating, vacuum evaporation and thermal
     decomposition. The process which comprises plating a given ceramic
     substrate in advance such as with platinum or silver by one of such
     methods and thereafter causing led dioxide to be electrodeposited thereon
     is easy to accomplish. It is, however, not advantageous from the
     economical point of view.
<BR><BR>The method of the present invention is characterized by first inducing
     deposition of lead dioxide by a chemical process or a soaking process so
     as to give rise to an electroconductive layer on the surface of a ceramic
     substrte which is intrinsically a poor conductor of electricity prior to
     causing electrodeposition of lead dioxide on said surface, and
     subsequently permitting the formed layer of lead dioxide to achieve growth
     by means of electrolysis and thereby producing a fine-grained electrode
     excellent in electroconductivity and advantageous for actual uses.
<BR><BR>Since the electrode according to the present invention uses a substrate of
     ceramic substance, it offers high resistance to corrosion and can be
     produced in any desired shape and dimensions.
<BR><BR>A porous substance produced by sintering silica, alumina, magnesia,
     zirconia, calcia, etc. is used as a ceramic material for the production of
     the substrate in the electrode of the present invention. The ceramic
     material may be made from either one member or from a mixture of a
     plurality of members selected from the group mentioned above. It is quite
     easy for such a ceramic material to be molded to any desired shape so as
     to suit the purpose for which the finally produced electrode is to be
     used.
<BR><BR>Since the ceramic substrate thus molded is a poor conductor of electricity,
     it is subjected to a treatment to impart desired electroconductivity to
     the surface thereof. And this treatment is carried out in accordance with
     the method disclosed by the same inventors in Japaneses Patent Publication
     No. 20164/1970. To be specific, the porous ceramic substrate molded to a
     desired shape is soaked in an aqueous lead (II) salt solution at
     temperatures from normal room temperature to 100.degree. C, preferably
     from 50.degree. to 80.degree. C, for a period of not less than 5 minutes
     and not more than 1 hour. The aqueous lead (II) salt solution is desired
     to be an aqueous solution of a water-soluble lead salt such as, for
     example, lead nitrate, lead acetate, lead perchlorate or lead sulfamate.
<BR><BR>At the end of said soaking, said ceramic substrate is taken out of said
     aqueous lead (II) salt solution and dried. This drying may be accomplished
     either by allowing the wet substrate to stand at normal room temperature
     or by being heated if accelerated drying is required. While the ceramic
     substrate is standing in the aqueous lead (II) salt solution, this
     solution penetrates into the porous surface layer of the substrate and
     adheres to the surface thereof as well. When the substrate is removed from
     the solution and then left to stand, the solution deposited in said
     surface layer and on the surface dries up to give rise to a uniform
     deposit of said lead (II) salt in the form of crystals.
<BR><BR>Thereafter, the dried substrate is again soaked in an ammoniacal aqueous
     persulfate solution or an alkaline aqueous persulfate solution to cause
     oxidation of the lead salt deposited on the surface.
<BR><BR>The aqueous persulfate solution incorporating aqueous ammonia to be used
     for said oxidation is obtained by preparing an aqueous 8-10% ammonia
     solution and adding to this solution such an amount of a persulfate to
     give a persulfate concentration of 5 to 6%. The concentrations of ammonia
     and persulfate mentioned above may be increased so as to suit the
     particular amount of the deposited lead dioxide desired to be oxidized on
     the surface of the substrate.
<BR><BR>The soaking in the aqueous persulfate solution incorporating the aqueous
     ammonia is required to be given for not less than 50 minutes up to 1.5
     hours, with the solution temperature kept between normal room temperature
     and 60.degree. C, preferably between 50.degree. and 60.degree. C.
<BR><BR>Examples of the persulfate, of which the aqueous solution is used for this
     oxidation, generally include persulfates of ammonium, sodium, potassium,
     etc.
<BR><BR>The aqueous persulfate solution incorporting an alkali metal hydroxide is
     obtained by adding a persulfate such as of ammonium, sodium or potassium
     to an aqueous solution of the hydroxide of an alkali metal such as sodium
     or potassium in such relative amounts that, in the finally produced
     aqueous solution, the alkali metal oxide concentration falls in the range
     of from 20 to 40 g/liter and the persulfate concentration in the range of
     from 60 to 100 g/liter respectively, with the pH value of the solution
     maintained between 13 and 11.
<BR><BR>As the result of the aforementioned treatment, crystals of lead dioxide are
     deposited on the surface of the substrate and in the pores distributed in
     the surface layer to a depth of several millimeters of the substrate.
<BR><BR>FIG. 2 is an X-ray diffraction diagram of the lead dioxide crystals
     deposited as described above. The horizontal axis is graduated for
     diffraction angle 20 and the vertical axis for the intensity of
     diffraction ray. From the diffraction diagram, it is seen that the lead
     dioxide is substantially composed of .alpha.-lead dioxide. If the formed
     layer of deposited lead dioxide does not have sufficient thickness and the
     substrate fails to show sufficient electroconductivity, a desired
     electroconductive layer can be obtained by repeating the aforementioned
     step of oxidative soaking. This soaking process is nothing but an
     operation intended to impart sufficient electroconductivity to the
     substrate. A layer of lead dioxide having a thickness sufficient for the
     purpose of a practical electrode is not obtained, therefore, by merely
     repeating this process.
<BR><BR>Desired growth of the layer of lead dioxide is accomplished by subsequently
     subjecting the substrate to the electrolytic process. This electrolytic
     process is effected as follows: In an electrolytic cell which contains, as
     the electrolyte, a lead (II) salt such as lead nitrate, lead perchlorate
     or lead sulfamate and, as the cathode, a piece of lead, copper or
     stainless steel (SUS 304, SUS 316, for example), the ceramic substrate
     which has been coated with lead dioxide in consequence of the
     aforementioned soaking process is disposed so as to function as the anode
     and electrolysis is effected.
<BR><BR>For the purpose of this electrolysis, it is desired to use aqueous lead
     nitrate solution as the aqueous lead (II) salt solution and to conduct the
     electrolysis under the following general conditions: The lead nitrate
     concentration is to fall in the range of from 0.5 to 1.0 mole/liter of
     Pb(NO.sub.3).sub.2, the pH value in the range of from 3.0 to 2.0, the
     solution temperature in the range of from 20.degree. to 60.degree. C and
     the anode current density in the range of from 0.5 to 20 A/dm.sup.2.
<BR><BR>The surface smoothness of the electrodeposited layer of lead dioxide is
     improved by adding to the electrolyte a nonionic surface active agent such
     as, for example, polyethylene oxide oleylether at a concentration of 5 to
     8 g/liter. The lead ion concentration and the pH value of the electrolyte
     can be adjusted by addition of a basic lead carbonate.
<BR><BR>Where the aqueous solution of any lead (II) salt other than lead nitrate is
     used as the electrolyte, the electrolysis is desired to be carried out
     under the following conditions: The lead (II) salt concentration is to
     fall in the range of from 0.5 to 1.0 mole/liter of electrolyte, the pH
     value in the range of from 2.0 to 3.0, the solution temperature in the
     range of from 20.degree.  to 60.degree. C and the anode current density in
     the range of from 0.5 to 10 A/dm.sup.2. The pH value is adjusted likewise
     by using a basic lead carbonate. Addition of a non-ionic surface active
     agent has a similar effect in improving the surface smoothness of the
     electrodeposited layer of led dioxide to the case of lead nitrate.
<BR><BR>The thickness of the electrodeposited layer of lead dioxide to be formed on
     the ceramic substrate serving as the anode increases with the increasing
     length of the time of electrolysis. For the purpose of an electrode which
     is to be used in the electrolysis of ordinary aqueous solutions, the layer
     thickness is generally sufficient in the range of from 1 to 3 mm.
<BR><BR>When the layer thickness has increased to reach a prescribed value, the
     electrolysis is stopped and the product of electrodeposition, namely the
     ceramic substrate now coated with the electrodeposited lead dioxide, is
     removed from the electrolytic cell and washed with water and dried. The
     drying is effected by first allowing it to stand at normal room
     temperature to 50.degree. C for preliminary drying and then exposing it to
     a heat at 100.degree. C. The layer of electrodeposited lead dioxide thus
     finally obtained is a fine-grained black coat excellent in
     electroconductivity. FIG. 1 shows an X-ray diffraction diagram of this
     product. The diagram clearly indicates that the product is an .alpha. +
     .beta. lead dioxide.
<BR><BR>A terminal attached at a proper position to the electrodeposited layer
     turns the product into a complete electrode ready for use.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 1
<BR><BR>A porous round bar of corundum (measuring 15mm in diameter and 300mm in
     height) was soaked in a saturated solution of lead (II) nitrate at
     90.degree. C for 5 minutes, then removed from the solution and left to dry
     at normal room temperature. Subsequently, the dried bar was placed in a
     solution which had been prepared by adding 30g of ammonium persulfate to
     500ml of aqueous ammonia (obtained by diluting an aqueous 28% ammonia
     solution with water of a volume twice as large) and heating the resultant
     mixture to 50.degree. to 60.degree. C and left to stand therein and
     undergo an oxidation treatment for about 1 hour. At the end of this
     treatment, the bar was washed first with dilute nitric acid and then with
     water and dried at 100.degree. C. Consequently, the bar was found to be
     coated with a layer of .alpha.-lead dioxide penetrating to a depth of 2 to
     3mm from the surface of the substrate.
<BR><BR>Then, the substrate which had been coated with the layer of .alpha.-lead
     dioxide as described above was disposed as an anode and a plate of
     stainless steel (SUS 304) was disposed as a cathode respectively in an
     electrolytic cell, which was filled with an aqueous 165 g/liter lead
     nitrate solution (with the pH value adjusted with nitric acid to 2.0). In
     this electrolytic cell, electrolysis was carried out at 25.degree. C. The
     anode current density was fixed at 0.5 A/dm.sup.2 in the initial phase of
     electrolysis and increased to a final level of 4-5 A/dm.sup.2 within four
     hours of electrolysis. After that, the flow of electric current was
     continued for 24 hours, with the current density fixed at said final
     level.
<BR><BR>Subsequently, said substrate used as the anode was taken out, washed with
     water and dried at 100.degree. C. There was consequently obtained an
     electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode having a corundum substrate coated
     with a uniform 2.0-mm layer of blackish gray lead dioxide.
<BR><BR>In an electrolytic cell divided into two compartments with an unglazed
     diaphragm, the electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode obtained as
     described above was disposed in the anode compartment and a lead plate of
     the same shape was disposed in the cathode compartment. With this
     electrolytic cell, production of iodic acid by electrolysis was tested
     under the following conditions: Anode liquid 500ml of 0.6N hydrochloric
     acid + 100g of powdered iodine, cathode liquid 500ml of 10% sulfuric acid,
     temperature 40.degree. C, voltage 5V, electric current 7A, anode current
     density 14 A/dm.sup.2. The flow of current was continued until 110.0 AH.
     Then it was discontinued and the anode liquid was evaporated to produce
     134g of iodic acid. By calculation, the yield was found to be 96.7%, the
     current efficiency to be 92.8% and the anode consumption to be 0.4 g/100g
     of HIO.sub.3. These results were substantially the same as those obtained
     by using a substrateless lead dioxide electrode.
<BR><BR>The fact that the electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode according to the
     present invention has greater strength than the substrate-less
     electrodeposited lead dioxide clearly indicates that the former excels
     over the latter in terms of practical utility.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 2
<BR><BR>A porous plate of mullite (measuring 50 .times. 150 .times. 2mm) was soaked
     in an aqueous lead (II) nitrate solution by following the procedure of
     Example 1. The it was taken out of the solution and immediately dried. The
     dried porous plate was then placed in a 30 g/500 ml potassium persulfate
     solution and, with the pH value adjusted to 12-13 by incorporation of 2N
     aqueous temperatures of hydroxide solution, treated for 1 hour at
     temperaturesof from 50.degree. to 60.degree. C. Then the plate was washed
     with water and dried similarly to Example 1. The dried plate was found to
     be coated with a uniform layer of .alpha.-lead dioxide having the same
     thickness as that obtained in Example 1 and penetrating into the surface
     layer of the porous substrate to a depth of 2 to 3mm from the surface.
     Subsequently, this plate was used to perform electrolysis and then treated
     in the same manner as before. Consequently, there was obtained an
     electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode having the porous substrate of
     mullite coated with a uniform compact layer of blackish gray lead dioxide
     having a thickness of 1.5mm.
<BR><BR>With this electrode used as the anode, electrolysis was performed by
     faithfully following the procedure of Example 1. The electrolysis gave
     entirely the same results, indicating that the porous mullite substrate
     coated with the layer of lead dioxide served as an excellent
     electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode similarly to the electrode
     described in Example 1.
<BR><BR>EXAMPLE 3
<BR><BR>A porous plate of zirconia (measuring 50 .times. 150 .times. 3mm) was
     soaked in a solution of lead perchlorate (226 g/1000 ml) at 40.degree. to
     50.degree. C for 10 minutes, then removed from the solution and dried at
     50.degree. C.
<BR><BR>Subsequently, the dried plate was placed in a solution which has been
     prepared by adding 30g of ammonium persulfate to 500ml of aqueous ammonia
     (obtained by diluting an aqueous 28% ammonia solution with water of a
     volume twice as large) and heating the resultant mixture to 50.degree. to
     60.degree. C and left to stand therein and undergo an oxidation treatment
     for 1 hour. At the end of this treatment, the plate was washed first with
     dilute nitric acid and then water and dried at 100.degree. C.
<BR><BR>After completion of this chemical treatment, the plate was used to conduct
     electrolysis under the same conditions as those described in Example 1.
     Consequently, as in Examples 1 and 2, there was obtained an
     electrodeposited lead dioxide electrode with a uniform compact layer of
     blackish gray lead dioxide having a thickness of 1 to 1.5mm.
