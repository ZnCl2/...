<h3 align=center>Electrolythic preparation of perchlorates</h3>
<hr>

      

        <h4 align=center> Abstract of the disclosure</h4>
Sodium perchlorate is prepared electrolytically from Sodium Chloride solutions in one step 
by passing a direct current through the solution , in the presence of sodium fluoride.
A mild steel cathode and a Lead Dioxide anode are satisfactory.<p><p>

This invention relates to the electroltic preparation of Perchlorates directly from Sodium
Chloride using Lead Dioxide anode.<br>
Hitherto it has been the practice to employ a two stage process for the production of
perchlorates from chlorides , the first stage being the oxidation of chloride 
to Chlorate using Graphite, Magnetite or Lead Dioxide anodes and the second stage consisting 
of the oxidation of Chlorate to Perchlorate, using Platinum or Lead Dioxide anodes. This
conventional process has various drawbacks, such as: <br>
(i) that in between the two stages the solutions have to be processed to isolate the Chlorate
and recover the unconverted Chloride:<br>
(ii) that Graphite gets desintegrated to a considerable extent and Magnetite to a lesser  extent 
when used in the production of Chlorates and<br>
(iii) that there is an inevitable loss of Platinum due to corrosion in the Perchlorate cell.<br>

With a view to avoiding the intermediate step of the processing of the liquor after the said 
first stage of the conventional process, it has been proposed that the effluent from the 
chlorate cell  should  be treated under different electrolytic conditions from thoses in 
which the sodium chloride solution was treated in the chlorate cell during the first stage 
of the process. But this proposed process also is a two stage process and the processing of
the effluent from the  chlorate cell introduces complications in the method.<br>
This invention has for its main object an improved method which will obviate the drawbacks 
of known methods, and whereby the perchlorates may be prepared directly from sodium chloride
in a single step of electrolytic oxidation, the conditions of electrolysis being maintained 
constant at predetermined levels throughout the period.  Another object of this invention is to
avoid the use of graphite, magnetite or platinum as the anode.
With these and other objects in view , this invention broadly consists of a process of preparing
 sodium perchlorate directly from sodium chloride  in a single step of electrolytic oxidation, 
which consists in passing a direct current through a bath of sodium chloride solution containing
 fluoride ions.<p>
The improved process according to this invention may be carried out into practice under the 
following conditions:<br>
(i) The said fluoride ions may be provided by adding sodium fluoride ou hydrogen fluoride to the
bath.<br>
(ii) About 0.5 to 5 grams per liter of sodium fluoride may be added; but about 2g/L is ok.<br>
(iii) The electrolytic oxidation may be carried out in  a cell having a stainless steel cathode
and a lead dioxide anode.<br>
(iv) The said anode may consist of a massive lead dioxide or  a GSLD.<br>
(v) The current density may be in range 5 to 40 amps per square decimeter.<br>
(vi) The electrolyte oxidation may be carried out at a temperature of  30  to 60 C.<br>
(vii) The process may be carried until all the chloride is converted into perchlorate, the
conditions being maintained constant at predetermined  levels throughout the process.<br>
The following Table I. gives the particulars of three different examples illustrating the 
invention.<p>
