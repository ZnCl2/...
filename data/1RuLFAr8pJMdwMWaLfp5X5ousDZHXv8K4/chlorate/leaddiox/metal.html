<H2 align=center>Making metal connections to an anode</H2>There are two 
connections to be considered regarding the anode. Firstly there is the 
connection to allow the anode to be plated (relatively easy to get right) and 
secondly there is the connection to the anode that is used when the anode goes 
into service. This is the most difficult connection to get right. This 
connection has to last for months and must pass substantial currents without 
heating excessively. It must be protected from the salts, both from salts that 
arrive externally to the connection (via spray from the cell) and also from 
salts that are transported to the connection via the substrate by cappillary 
action up the substrate (if the substrate is porous). This is the more difficult 
problem to counteract.  With Graphite or Ti substrate
anodes there is no connection problem as the supply is simply connected to the substrate.

<P>
<H3>Connections for long term service of the anode</H3>The connection to carry 
the heavy (10's of amps), long term (months) current for when the anode goes 
into service in a (Per)Chlorate cell is the big problem.  Most metals are not compatible with 
Lead Dioxide and if you try to put a copper strap onto the anode the current 
will stop flowing after a very short time. The problem is that non conductive 
metal oxides always appear at the junction of the metal and the Lead Dioxide so 
that current stops flowing. Silver forms a conductive Oxide when used to connect 
to Lead Dioxide and is therefor the only suitable metal for the job. See JES 
Vol. 105 page 101 (available on this web page) for a discussion.<BR>If Graphite 
is used to form a permanent connection it is difficult to get a low resistance 
contact to the Lead Dioxide because the effective contact area between the rigid 
Graphite and the rigid Lead Dioxide will be small. The Graphite will, at the 
very least, have to be lapped so that it will have good contact. 
It should be noted that silver is quite resistant to salts from the 
cells and is MUCH more resistant than copper. The Graphite and Silver paint is 
not a bad combination.<BR>
<P>Silver paint can be purchased from car accessory stores. It is used for 
mending rear windscreen heaters and is usually called 'Electroconnect' or 
'Electrorepair' or some such like. It can vary in price from shop to shop so 
shop around. It should cost about 8 US dollars for about 3ml. This sounds 
expensive but 3ml will do quite a lot of connecting. <A 
href="box.html">Scan 
of Silver Conductive Paint Box.</A>Conductive silver paint can also be purchased 
from electronic supply houses where it is sold for doing quick mending jobs to 
printed circuit boards. It is important to realise that the paint must have 
silver METAL in it, not just a silver colour. Aluminium paint is 'silver' paint 
but it will be absolutely useless for the task here. Ebay may be a source. Use 
'conductive silver paint' as a search string. <BR>Silver can also be 
electrodeposited on from a Silver Nitrate or Chloride tank, but it requires more 
work.
<P>The metal connection must be protected from the 
corrosive effects of the (Per)Chlorate cell. This is important. 
<BR>There should be no salts arriving to your connection via spray or such 
like (externally) if you operate the cell with a proper lid and the anodes and 
cathodes are installed in the lid properly.<BR>
<P> 
Silver is quite resistant to the salts from the (Per)Chlorate cell and is 
MUCH more resistant than Copper. <BR>If your junction between the anode and the 
conductor is not been overstressed (big current, relatively small area) then the 
connection is not too critical and crocidile clips or clothes pegs can be used 
to hold Copper braid in place against the Silvered areas. With Graphite or Ti substrate
anodes there is no connection problem as the supply is simply connected to the substrate.<p> 

See <A href="copper.html">Silver and Copper electroplated connections.</A><BR>
It must be bourne in mind that the 
connection will fail, no mater how good it is, if salts are getting to it.
