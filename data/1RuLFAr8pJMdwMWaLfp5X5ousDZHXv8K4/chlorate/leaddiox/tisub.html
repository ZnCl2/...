As the price of Titanium has decreased and become more easily available it has become a sensible choice 
as a substrate for a Lead Dioxide Anode.<br> Ti is from a group of metals known as Valve metals. The 
group includes Ta, Nb and Hf. These other members may be used as a substrate but they are more expensive
and harder to find. Valve metals become passivated under 'Anodic polarization' conditions. This means that if you connect a Valve metal to the + of a DC supply in a cell as an Anode, the protective layer of Oxide will immediately stop the current flowing and protect the metal. As you increase the Voltage there will come a point where this oxide layer will break down and the metal will corrode severely. This Voltage is approx. 21 Volts for Ti in Chlorate + Perchlorate solution @ 20&deg;C. It is approx. 45 Volts for Ta. If temperature is increased the breakdown Voltage decreases to about 70% at 60&deg;C (in salt solution)<SMALL>(From Industrial Electrochemical Processes, page 550)</SMALL>.<br>
If the same piece of Valve metal is connected as a Cathode, Hydrogen gas will immediately dope the Oxide layer and make it conductive so that current will flow. A Valve metal has Diode (Valve) characteristics when in an electrolyte.<p>

Ti is available on ebay. Search for Titanium sheet or plate or rod. (Search for Titanblech in the German ebay). Grade 1, 2, 3 or 4
 are best to use for Anodes as the more common 6/4 alloy (6% Al, 4% V) may not be suitable due to the alloying elements. (It may be OK). 
In the patents etc, when the Grade is mentioned it is usually Grade one. It is easy to drill and etch. Grade four is difficult to drill and will not etch with HCl, you will need HF acid. Hot Oxalic acid and hot Sulphuric acid can be used to etch Ti.
 There is some info on Titanium Grades

<p>
Lead Dioxide plated onto bare Ti will not work  because a layer of non-conducting Ti Oxide will always build up between the 
Ti and the Lead Dioxide because Lead Dioxide is a strong oxidizer. You must have a precoat between the Ti and the Lead
 Dioxide.<p>
<ul><li>
 Industry has used Pt or Pt Oxide as the precoat. This may be too expensive for the home producer.  An article, Performance characteristics of a new type of Lead Dioxide coated Titanium Anode,  Journal of Applied Electrochemistry.  Volume 25, Number 9 / September, 1995, describes an interface coat using Ti, Ta and Pt compounds.<p>
<li>
Another interface layers that has been mentioned is Ebonex, a trade name for Ti4O7.  Ebonex can be made from Ti + Hydrogen gas in an oven. See US 2957787, 'Making TiO2 Conductive'.  An Ebonex Electrode is described in JOURNAL OF APPLIED ELECTROCHEMISTRY 22 (1992) 200-203.<p>
<li>
A coating of Cobalt Oxide or Manganese Dioxide may also suffice as a precoat between Ti and LD.<P>
<li>
 A very cheap interface layer consists of Doped Tin Oxide (SnO<small>2</small>) .  Antimony, Molybdenum, Fluorine
 and Pt (and more) have been used as the dopant. See link below.<P>
<li>



US Patent  4444642 uses MMO as an interface layer. Old pool chlorinator cells, corrosion anodes, or regular MMO coated Ti mesh etc could be used as the substrate. See link below.<p>

<a href="mmold.html"> Ti substrate, MMO interface layer,  LD Anode</a><br><P>
Do not use Fluorine additive in Chlorate or Perchlorate cells when using Ti substrate LD Anodes as it may cause  cracking of LD and erosion of Ti substrate.<br>
