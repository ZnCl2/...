						<p>The present 
                        invention relates to a novel electrode for use in 
                        electrochemical processes and to the methods of making 
                        and using the same; and, more particularly, to a novel 
                        lead dioxide-coated electrode which is particularly 
                        useful in the electrolysis of chlorates in the 
                        manufacture of perchlorates, to its method of 
                        preparation and to its use especially in the 
                        electrolysis of chlorates to perchlorates.<BR><p>It has 
                        long been known that aqueous solutions of chlorates, 
                        such as the alkali metal chlorates, can be electrolyzed 
                        to form the corresponding perchlorate in solution. For 
                        example, in the preparation of potassium perchlorate, 
                        common practice is to electrolyze sodium chlorate to 
                        form sodium perchlorate, treat the sodium perchlorate 
                        with potassium chloride to precipitate potassium 
                        perchlorate and return sodium chloride to the chlorate 
                        cells. The literature on the electrolytic production of 
                        perchlorates indicates a unanimous acceptance of 
                        platinum as the only suitable anode material. In spite 
                        of the high capital investment involved and the 
                        significant replacement costs due to electrochemical 
                        attack and mechanical disintegration, platinum is still 
                        used as anode in the major perchlorate 
                        installations.<BR><p>However, for reasons apparent from 
                        the above, the search for a platinum substitute, both 
                        for perchlorate manufacture and for other 
                        electrochemical operations requiring  highly resistant 
                        electrodes, has proceeded for many years. None of the 
                        materials investigated in the past, however, has been 
                        adopted commercially.<p>

                        to be serviceable as anode material  in perchlorate

                        the electrochemical oxidation of chlorates. Although 
                        cold-pressed and sintered silicon anodes have been found 
                        to operate without noticeable erosion, during 
                        operation the voltage rises rapidly to a very high value 
                        due to polarization, and this polarization 
                        characteristic renders silicon unusable commercially.

                        low current densities. Although this material shows only 
                        a slight erosion during operation, the perchlorate is 
                        produced at a current efficiency of only 4 to

                        use as anode material in the electrolytic oxidation of

                        copper or nickel metal bases. Although the lead dioxide, 
                         especially in massive form, has a very low rate of 
                        erosion itself in the chlorate-perchlorate system, the 
                        base metals on to which it is deposited are relatively 
                        rapidly eroded since the electrolyte gains access 
                        thereto  through pin holes in the lead dioxide 
                        coating.<BR><p>According to this

                        a coating of the lead dioxide is electro-deposited 
                        directly on a tantalum body, which is rendered 
                        substantially oxide-free before the

						It has been found that lead dioxide can be 
                        anodically electrodeposited on to a tantalum metal body 
                        to provide an anode material which, although much less 
                        expensive than platinum, possesses markedly long life 
                        when employed in electrolytic oxidation systems, 
                        especially those systems which rapidly attack ordinary 
                        metals, such as the chlorate-perchlorate system. 
                        Tantalum metal is known to polarize anodically in most 
                        electrolytes, and in screening tests for a platinum 
                        substitute in the electrolytic oxidation of chlorates, 
                        tantalum was found to polarize within seconds. However, 
                        it was found quite unexpectedly that, in the 
                        conventional lead dioxide plating baths, this 
                        polarization does not occur so that deposits of lead 
                        dioxide of very high quality and of any desired 
                        thickness can readily be built up, by anodic 
                        electrodeposition on the tantalum metal base. The 
                        conventional lead dioxide plating baths generally fall 
                        within one of three principal systems: <br>
						(1) alkaline 
                        aqueous solutions of lead tartrate;<br>
						(2) nonalkaline 
                        aqueous solutions of lead perchlorate, and<br>
						(3) acid 
                        aqueous solutions of lead nitrate.<br>
						Thus it has been 
                        found that with any of these baths massive coatings of 
                        lead dioxide of high quality can be readily deposited on 
                        tantalum.<BR><BR>

						The polarization phenomenon referred to 
                        above, however, does occur with tantalum in 
                        chlorate-perchlorate oxidation cells. In this case, the 
                        rapid polarization of the tantalum prevents it from 
                        becoming attacked chemically due to electrolyte gaining 
                        access to it through the lead dioxide coating. When the 
                        lead dioxide-coated tantalum product is employed as 
                        anode in a chlorate-perchlorate cell, the current passes 
                        into the cell through the lead dioxide and the tantalum 
                        base acts as an inert core. Any current leakage through 
                        the tantalum results in the rapid formation of a 
                        polarizing film on the surface of the tantalum thereby 
                        preventing chemical attack thereon. The tantalum, 
                        therefore, never erodes or contaminates the bath. When 
                        the lead dioxide eventually becomes eroded,  the 
                        tantalum core may be reused as base for further lead 
                        dioxide coatings. The lead dioxide-coated tantalum anode 
                        of the present invention may also be employed as anode 
                        in the electrolytic oxidation of chromic sulphate to 
                        chromic acid, in the electrolytic oxidation of sulphate 
                        to persulphate and in the electrolysis of sodium 
                        chloride directly to sodium perchlorates.<p>

						In preparing the 
                        alkaline lead tartrate bath, lead tartrate itself may be 
                        added to water along with a suitable base,  or lead 
                        tartrate may be formed in situ in the bath. This latter 
                        embodiment is the preferred method of preparing the lead 
                        tartrate bath, and comprises mixing in water a soluble 
                        tartrate other than lead tartrate, such as  an alkali 
                        metal tartrate, like sodium potassium tartrate, a base 
                        and lead oxide (PbO).<BR><BR>The lead oxide dissolves in 
                        the alkaline tartrate solution forming lead tartrate in 
                        solution. In this embodiment it is not necessary that 
                        stoichiometric amounts of tartrate and lead oxide be 
                        employed. For example, with sodium potassium tartrate, 
                        NaKC4H4O6.4H20, between 1 and 1.5 parts, by 
                        weight preferably between 1.1 and 1.25  parts, by 
                        weight, thereof per part of lead oxide may be 
                        used.<BR><BR>
						The lead tartrate bath, as stated, is to be 
                        alkaline, and hence a soluble base, preferably an alkali 
                        metal hydroxide, including  ammonium hydroxide, is 
                        employed. Sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide are 
                        preferred, with the former being particularly 
                        advantageous. The amount of base present in the alkaline 
                        lead tartrate bath,  that is to say, the alkalinity 
                        of the bath, may vary somewhat. The prior art suggests 
                        that a total of 2.7 to 3.4 moles of alkali hydroxide be 
                        present in the bath per mole of lead tartrate. However, 
                        there is an improvement  in the anodic 
                        electrodeposition of lead dioxide from a lead tartrate 
                        bath which is achieved when the total amount of alkali 
                        hydroxide present provides a mole ratio thereof to lead 
                        tartrate of at least 4.5 to 1, and the amount of 
                        alkali hydroxide present may provide a mole ratio 
                        thereof to lead tartrate of as high as 8 to 1, or 
                        higher. When the lead tartrate is formed in situ in the 
                        bath, there results 2 moles of alkali hydroxide 
                        for each mole of lead tartrate formed.<BR><BR>This 
                        alkali hydroxide, of course, becomes part of the " total 
                        " alkali hydroxide in the bath, and must be taken into 
                        consideration in determining the amount of alkali 
                        hydroxide to provide the total mole ratio referred to 
                        above. In any event, the pH of the alkaline tartrate 
                        bath should be relatively high, pH values above 12 being 
                        particularly satisfactory.<BR><BR>The actual 
                        concentration of the main materials of the bath at the 
                        beginning of the deposition may vary widely, although 
                        excessively high concentrations may lead to 
                        precipitation and low quality deposits. For these 
                        reasons, the concentration of lead in the bath is 
                        generally not in excess of 8% (93 grams per litre). The 
                        concentration of lead may be substantially below this, 
                        and may be as low as 1 to 2% (10 to 20 grams per litre). 
                        In preferred practice, the concentration of lead in the 
                        bath ranges between 3 and 5% (between 32 and 55 grams 
                        per litre).<BR><p>

						The lead perchlorate bath for

                        neutral to acid, preferably acid. The bath may be

                        perchloric acid. The amount of perchloric acid employed 
                        will be at least that theoretically required to combine 
                        with the lead oxide to provide lead perchlorate, and 
                        preferably excess perchloric acid is employed so that 
                        the pH of the solution is acid. Referring further to the 
                        pH, acid pH conditions are preferred, as stated,

						The lead nitrate bath is essentially an 
                        aqueous acid solution of lead nitrate. In preparing the 
                        bath, lead nitrate itself may be added to water, or the 
                        lead nitrate may be formed in situ in the bath, as by 
                        mixing lead oxide (PbO) with aqueous nitric 
                        acid.<BR><BR>In connection with this latter embodiment, 
                        slow addition. of the lead oxide in finely divided form 
                        to the aqueous nitric acid, with stirring, is 
                        advantageous.<BR><BR>In general, the more acid the lead 
                        nitrate bath, the better its operation, and pH values as 
                        low as 0.8 may be employed. At acidities appreciably 
                        greater than this, acid fuming from the bath becomes 
                        excessive, especially at elevated operating 
                        temperatures. The  tantalum on to which the lead 
                        dioxide is plated is not attacked at pH values as low as 
                        this. Of course, the pH of the bath may range above this 
                        figure and may go as high as 4 or more, if desired. The

                        commences, may have a pH somewhat higher than the above 
                        figures, since, once operation has started, the pH drops

                        deposition operation, may vary widely. In this 
                        connection, the concentration of the lead nitrate  in 
                        the bath may range from as low as 50 grams per litre to 
                        as high as the maximum solubility thereof in the bath at

                        per litre. In general, it is desirable, in order to 
                        produce a lead dioxide deposit of optimum homogeneity, 
                        strength and surface characteristics, to maintain high 
                        concentrations of lead nitrate in the vicinity of the 
                        anode. Accordingly, concentrations  above the lower 
                        end of the range, such as at least 250 grams per litre 
                        and especially at least 300 grams per litre, are 
                        preferred.<BR><p>

                        in excess of its solubility at these lower temperatures, 
                         which may be in the neighbourhood of 400 grams per 
                        litre. For optimum commercial operation, the 
                        concentration of the lead nitrate will not exceed 350 
                        grams per litre.<BR><BR>In the lead nitrate bath, a

                        copper nitrate, Cu(NO3)2.3H20, may vary widely, and may 
                        run as high as  6 grams per litre, although it has been  
                        found that amounts as low as 0.5 grams per litre provide 
                        significant results.<BR><BR>There is a novel acid lead

                        polyether alcohols. The presence of such material 
                        ensures the deposition of hard, dense, fine-grained lead 
                        dioxide. The amount  of non-ionic surface-active
