<tr><th align=center> <font size=6> The Electrodeposition of  Lead Dioxide</font></table></table></table></center><p><br><p>

 <BR>There have been a number of different baths proposed for the 
electrodeposition (plating) of (Beta) Lead Dioxide but the bath that has gained general 
acceptance is the bath containing Lead Nitrate. The Lead Nitrate bath plates well 
under the widest range of parameters and is easy to make up. There is rather a lot of contradictory results in scientific literature regarding Alpha 
and/or Beta Lead Dioxide being deposited from acidic Lead Nitrate baths, see <A href="jes2002.html"> JES, 149 (9), 2002 </A> . High plating current density gives Alpha, low plating current density gives Beta at Nitric acid levels of 18 to 30g/l (not 100% sure what occurs at lower acid levels). Beta type  Lead Dioxide  is desired as the  outside layer of Anodes though Alpha has been shown to work OK too.<br>
The plating process can be represented by the following overall equation:<br>

<ul>
Pb(NO<small>3</small>)<small>2</small> + 2H<small>2</small>O =====>> PbO<small>2</small> + 2HNO<small>3</small> + H<small>2    </small> <br>
 ( two Electrons are required)</ul>
<br>
Nitric acid is produced at a rate of two moles of Nitric acid (126 grams) for ever one mole of Lead Dioxide (239.2 grams) deposited with 2 moles (53.604 Ah) of electrons  required when plating is proceeding at 100% current efficiency (CE). The rate of Lead Dioxide deposition at 100% CE is 4.462 grams per amp per hour. The build up of Nitrites in the tank causes CE to drop to very low levels if action is not taken to eliminate them.

 If the bath is not to have Lead Nitrate crystallizing out as it cools to room temperature, 
the Lead Nitrate should be kept below 400 grams per litre  of solution.<br>
 The solubility of Lead Nitrate in Grams per litre of water is approx. 360g/l @
0&deg;C, 560g/l @ 20&deg;C & 960g/l @ 60&deg;C. <br>
 The solubility in the tank will be a small amount less than this due to the presence of 
Nitric acid which suppresses solubility. At low Nitric acid concentrations (good plating conditions) there is little difference.<br>
The density of solutions made from adding 100, 200, 300 and 350 gram amounts of Lead Nitrate to one litre of water are  1.078, 1.157,  1.236 and 1.275 grams per ml of solution respectively. The density figure of 1.157 represents a solution concentration of 193 grams per litre of Lead Nitrate solution. The figure can be used as an indicator of the  lower limit of Lead Nitrate concentration for good plating.<br>
Distilled or deionized water should be used if possible but clean rain water will do if distilled is not available. The more shortcuts you take the more likely a failure will occur when
the Anode goes into service (or before).<BR>
See here for further <A href="baths.html"> discussion 
regarding plating baths</A> in general and alternative baths that can be used for plating.<BR>
See here for a <A href="leadbaths.html"> listing of alternative plating baths</A>. <BR>
The Lead Nitrate can be make using Lead metal (used for roofing 
and is available from builders providers) and Nitric acid.<br>
 See <A href="pbnitrat.html">Making Lead nitrate and other Lead compounds.</A>
 <BR>The Copper Nitrate can be made by 
reacting  Copper wire with Nitric acid and adding resulting blue liquid to 
plating tank. More Copper Nitrate may have to be added as Copper gets depleated.
<BR>
<BR>The function of the Copper Nitrate is to stop Lead metal from being 
electro deposited on to the Cathodes of the plating tank and therefor wasting 
Lead ions. Quite a lot of Lead will be deposited on to the Cathodes if you are 
using a near neutral plating solution. It is inclined to grow in very long dendrites
and cause an electrical short to the Anode. See -discussion regarding plating baths- 
(link above).<br>
<b><u>Current Density on Anode</u></b><br>
The amount of Beta or Alpha that is plated can be controlled by current density on the Anode according to one source I have communicated with. High current density (70mA per square cm) giving mainly the Alpha, 40mA per square cm and below giving mainly the Beta (@18 to 30g/l Nitric acid). This has been confirmed by X ray studies. See Electrochimica Acta 52 (2006) 786–793 for refs on info and also <A href="jes2002.html"> JES, 149 (9), 2002 </A>. regarding Alpha/Beta from Lead Nitrate baths. <br>
Sometimes a large current density is used at the start of plating in order to create a large density of PbO<small>2</small> nucleation sights to improve adhesion of the PbO<small>2</small> to the substrate.<br>
<b><u>Current Density on Cathode</u></b><br>
US patent 2,945,791 states that current density on Cathodes should be at 2X to 3X Anode current density. Nitrites building up in the tank effect plating CE (see below) and the higher the current density on the Cathodes the more the problem occurs so bear that in mind if you are not actively combating Nitrites. <br>
<P><u>HARDWARE</U>.
<P>The Plating tank can be a  glass beaker as it is good to be able to 
see the Anode plating.  Use a good tank as 
you do NOT want it to break and spill toxic Lead Nitrate all over the 
place.  Polyethylene seems to stand up OK. Cable ties become brittle and Silicon sealer deteriorates so do 
not use these materials in the tank. A plastic air stone (used for stirring) also failed after a few hours. Silicon tubing  holds up OK.
<BR>Heater for tank. 
This can come in the form of an aquarium heater with it's control altered to let it heat to 70&deg;C.  A magnetic hot plate stirrer can be used or other system that will heat the solution to 70&deg;C approx. Test out your system using water first to see how it is working. Polyester cloth can be used as a filter if using a two
tank system.

<p>A DC supply capable of putting 
out a few Volts and the required plating current is needed. Generally lower plating currents give smoother coats of Lead Dioxide and about 20mA/cm^2 is good for most of the plating run. This current density will give Beta Lead Dioxide from the Lead Nitrate tank. For some ideas on power supplies see <A href="supply.html">Power supplies.</A> 
<P>When deciding what plating current to use you simply calculate the surface area 
that you have to plate (cm squared) and multiply it by the current density (in 
mA/cm squared) you want to plate at. This will tell you the amount of mA that you need 
to put into the Anode. You simply adjust the Voltage on the supply to give you 
that current. If using the battery charger supply in the link above, you simply attach the required 
number of flying Leads to the Anode. A constant current source is good for this 
type of application. The Anode is connected to the positive lead.
<BR>The Cathodes for 
the plating tank can be Copper. Don't use Gouging rods, there are reports that some 
Gouging rods contain Iron particles. Iron is NOT wanted in the tank. 
 The Cathodes surround the substrate that you are 
plating and at least two should be used. The surface area of the Cathode(s) 
facing the substrate to be plated should be at least half the surface area that 
you are plating. Alternatively a spiral of Copper wire can be used surrounding 
the substrate or some Copper strips. Distance 
between substrate (Anode) and Cathode is not critical and can be of the order of 
about an inch or two. There should be no sharp corners or abrupt indents on the Anode 
to be plated. <p>

 <b><i><u>Nitric acid and Lead ion concentration control.</i></u> </b><br>
Nitric acid is formed as plating progresses. To stop the concentration of Nitric acid from becoming too high you must have a suitable large tank (if using a one tank system) If using a  two tank system with a pump, then the total plating solution volume need not be so large. You must add neutral solution to the plating tank at the appropriate rate.

It would appear from patents etc, that the best concentration of Nitric acid to have in your plating bath is in the region of 5 to 10 grams Nitric acid per litre. US Patent 3,463,707 explicitly states Nitric Acid concentrations higher than 20 grams per litre make it physically impossible to plate Lead Dioxide continuously but that is hardly true. The Nitric acid concentration will increase once you start to plate. You will get two moles of Nitric acid forming for every mole of Lead Dioxide that you plate which needs 53.604 Ampere hours of electrons. Thats 126 Grams acid for every 239.2 Grams Lead Dioxide, = 0.527 grams acid per gram Lead Dioxide deposited. An alternative way to describe this is to say that you will get 2.3506 grams of acid forming per hour per Amp. Most amateur Anodes in the past end up getting formed in baths with much more that the ideal concentration of Nitric acid in the plating solution. If using a one tank system (with no addition of Lead Compounds) a large tank is necessary. If you start your plating operation off with 6 grams per litre Nitric acid and you want to avoid the acid concentration going above 12 grams per litre Nitric acid you will need a tank size of  87.8ml per gram Lead Dioxide that you want to deposit. <br>
Figure out how many grams of Lead Dioxide you need to deposit to form your Anode from the projected Anode dimensions minus the substrate volume multiplied by the density of Lead Dioxide (9.37 grams per cc). <BR>
For example if you want to deposit 100 grams Lead Dioxide (not a large Anode) and you decide to start off your plating solution at 6 grams per litre Nitric acid and you do not wish for the acid concentration to go above 12 grams per litre, then you need a minimum (one tank system with no adding in of Lead Compounds during plating) of 100 multiplied by 87.8 = 8.8 litres. That's a big tank!!  It would appear that  adding Lead Compound (with or without a second tank) is the sensible way to go if the acid concentration is to be kept in the most desirable range.<P>
The pH of water and Nitric acid can be calculated from  <a href="http://www.sensorex.com/support/education/pH_calculator.html"> this</a> page. pH values corresponding to Nitric acid amounts per litre of water are given in the table (as per calculator at link) and they  correspond to actual measured values of pH when  Nitric acid  was added to a Lead Nitrate solution of 340 grams per litre. The molarity of 70% HNO<SMALL>3</SMALL> is 15.6 and it's density is 1.42 g/cc.<p>




The amount of Lead ion per gram of PbO<small>2</small> is 0.839 grams. The amount of Lead ion per gram of Lead Nitrate (Pb(NO<SMALL>3</SMALL>)<SMALL>2</SMALL>) is 0.6256 grams. Therefor each gram of 
deposited Lead Dioxide will use up 1.341 grams Lead Nitrate.  The concentration of Lead Nitrate should not be let fall below 200g/litre. If the tank size is large enough to keep the Nitric acid concentration at reasonable levels then Lead Ion depletion of the plating solution will not be a problem. It is advantageous to have the Lead ion and Nitric acid concentration as constant as possible during plating.

 When going for a one or two tank system and adding Lead Compound as plating progresses, the total plating solution volume need not be as large as when using a one tank system with no addition of Lead Compound. 
<BR> If using a one tank system and adding Lead compound you will need to add the amounts in the table below<p>
Each mole of Electrons (26.8 ampere hours) that flows  will produce one mole Nitric acid (63 grams), assuming 100% current efficiency, which is equal to  2.35 grams Nitric acid forming per hour per amp.<br>
 Another way to look at this is to say that  a half mole of Lead Dioxide  is plated onto the Anode per 26.8 ampere hours,  (119.6 grams Lead Dioxide per 26.8 ampere hours) which is equal to 4.462 grams Lead Dioxide per amp per hour. You need to add Lead compound to replenish the transfered Lead Ions and depending on the Lead compound you are using the weight added will need to equal the molar amounts of Lead Ion being transfered. The table below gives the relevant molecular weights of the Lead compounds that are used and thus the amounts to add to the tank per amp per hour. This amount of addition will keep the extra acid generated neutralized as well. This is the rate at 100% CE.<p>

	The addition of Carbonate or Basic Carbonate will cause problems with foaming, bubbles and floating. A slurry of these compounds may  have to be made (by adding some of the compound + some neutral plating solution to a well capped container and shaking) in order stop them  floating on the surface of the plating solution. Lead Carbonate comes in a large array of molecular weights so check what you have.<br>
	It may be possible to have an excess of Litharge at the bottom of a one  tank system (if stirring is not used or perhaps intermittent stirring) which will react fairly slowly with the Nitric as it is produced and help keep the Lead ion concentration constant and the Nitric acid concentration in the wanted range.  If the Litharge is too finely divided (small particle size) it may react too easily with the Nitric acid and be inclined to keep the pH of the bath too high (concentration of the Nitric acid will be too low). You cannot use Lead Carbonate or Hydroxide or Basic Lead Carbonate in excess in the one tank system as they will keep the pH too high (they react too readily with the Nitric acid formed) and the Carbonate will also cause bubbles/foaming as it reacts with the acid. See <a href="tankcare.html">here</A> for some observations regarding addition of Lead compounds to the tank.<br><p>
	
From US Patent No. 4,130,467, we have Litharge addition rates of 4 grams per amp per hour in one example and 3.5 grams per hour per amp in another example. The additions were made every two hours.
They used a six litre tank in the second example which gives an idea of tank size/deposition rate between each addition of Litharge. It is next to impossible to get a figure for surface area they were plating.

</td><td>When using a two tank system with Lead Dioxide deposition being performed in one tank and an excess of neutralizing Lead compound in the  other tank (more neutral  solution), then you must pump the more neutral liquid into the plating tank at the appropriate rate to keep Nitric acid at the desired concentration and keep Lead ion replenished. <b><font color=red>
The amount you need to pump out of the Plating tank into the Neutral tank has been found from experience to be in the region of 17ml per Amp per minute. The pH in the more neutral tank will stay in the region of pH = 3.5 (thats what it did with the Pb Carbonate I had anyways) with the pH in the Plating tank staying around one.  </font></b>
<br>It should be noted that no solid Lead compounds should be allowed to come across from the neutral tank or the pump rate will need to be reduced by a large amount.<br> The simple arrangement shown  works as a two tank system with a very simple pump based on an aquarium air pump to keep the more neutral tank stirred. A magnetic stirrer bar would be better. Stirring of some sort is necessary. Careful of spray, use covers. A peristaltic pump on a timer serves well to pump fluid from the Plating tank to Neutralizer tank. Half inch holes in the Neutral tank covered with a wrap around cloth serve as a return path for the fluid.  The tank can be set up first using a solution of (say) Ammonium Nitrate at a density of approximately 1.3 grams per cc and a temperature of 70C to ascertain pumping rates/times etc. Perspex beads can be added to the tank and if vigorous stirring is used they will keep bubbles swept off the forming Anode. Stirring of some sort is required  in the plating tank. Floating some polystyrene in the plating tank can help lessen evaporation which can be a nuisance. Don't use cable ties, or anything made from Nylon, in the plating tank as they turn brittle and break after 24 hours or so.</table><p>
There is a useful Microsoft Excell spreadsheet (in a .zip file) <a href="plating.zip">here</a> that can be used for calculations regarding the Lead Nitrate plating tank.




<BR><p>
<b><i><u>Formation of Nitrites</i></u><br></b>

It appears from some Lead Dioxide plating runs that Nitrites are not a problem if a few grams of Minum (Pb304, red Lead) is put into the Neutralizer tank though it may give LD Anodes that give low CE%?.<br>
See <a href="nitrites.html">here</a> for some discussion.<p><br>

<IMG alt="[BAFFLE ]" hspace=10 src="baffle.gif"  align=left vspace=10><br>
<IMG alt="[BAFFLE ]" hspace=10 src="substrate_y.jpg"  align=right vspace=10><br>
Lead Dioxide is inclined to grow on protruding edges giving 'molars' of Lead Dioxide that are not suppored by any Ti substrate. They are inclined to  fall off after some weeks or months of operation of the Anode. They should be avoided as they  shorten the life time of Anodes, waste plating time, waste chemicles  and give an Anode that gets smaller in surface area as the nodules fall off. The diagram shows a plastic baffle placed at the substrate edges to stop this phenomena. <br>If using drilled Ti as the substrate it is  a good idea to spend some time shaping the substrate and perhaps serrating the edges as shown in the diagram.<p><br> 
During plating some Copper will be deposited 
onto the Cathodes and if the blue colour of the plating solution gets weak, add more Copper Nitrate. You can add Copper Carbonate to the neutralizer tank  to help keep Copper concentration high enough.<br>
 There will also be some bubbles on the Anode that are not 
welcome but are inevitable. Addition of Perspex beads together with stirring is a great help at keeping bubbles swept off the Anode if stirring is aggressive enough. <br>
Plating current should not be interrupted.<BR> <br>
Weigh the Anode substrate before plating so that you will know how much 
Lead Dioxide was electro-deposited for calculating plating CE etc.
<P>Keep an eye on evaporation from the tank as it can lower the level of 
electrolyte in the tank and leave you with a shorter than expected 
Anode. Some polystyrene beads floating on the liquid surface would help to reduce evaporation. 

<BR>It is a very good practice to test the tank 
using a small piece of Graphite about one inch or so at about 
20mA/cm^2 and see that the plating is good. If the tank will not plate 
Graphite there is a problem with it. Keep Gouging rods away from the tank.
<br><P>Ions that are bad news in a plating tank, according to the literature, 
are Chloride (US 3,463,707), Iron (US 3,463,707 & 4,038,170), Cobalt, Selenium and Arsenic.
