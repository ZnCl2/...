<h2 aligh=center> Lead Dioxide substrate Lead Dioxide Anode </h2>

<img src="ldslda.jpg" align=right border=2>
This Anode was proposed by G.P. (name depending on pond side :-)) Success varied, with anodes lasting from hours to months. Pieces of Lead Dioxide were put into a porous plastic bag/wrap. A Graphite rod was placed on top of the contents of the bag/wrap and the contents + part of the Graphite rod was plated. The bag/wrap used in the picture was mesh material used in the garden to keep down weeds.<p>
