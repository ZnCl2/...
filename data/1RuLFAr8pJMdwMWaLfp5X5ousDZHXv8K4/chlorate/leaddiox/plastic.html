<H2>Plastic Substrate Lead Dioxide Anodes (PSLD anode).</A></H2>
<HR>
A substrate can be made from plastic.<p>
The plastic substrate Anode has been difficult to get to work for the Amateur. 
It is difficult to obtain a good heavy coat of Lead Dioxide that will adhere
well to the plastic substrate and give a good reliable connection at the top
for the heavy, long term connection required for the (Per)Chlorate cell.<p>
The advantages of the plastic substrate 
it that it is easy to obtain and is non porous and therefor will not suffer to a 
great extent from the problem of the salts from the Chlorate/Perchlorate cell 
getting to the current connection by cappillary action. Not all plastics will 
stand up to the harsh conditions in a Chlorate/Perchlorate cell and there you 
must know what type of plastic you have. Plastics that are suitable for the task 
are polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, teflon, ployvinylchloride (PVC) and 
polystyrene (...and counting).<BR>If you have a plastic and you wish to see if 
it is up to the task, you can test it by setting up a chlorate cell using a 
graphite anode (or lead dioxide) and placing the plastic to be tested in the 
cell close to the anode for a few days. If the plastic remains intact then it is 
probably ok for to use as a substrate for an anode. Plastic bars can be 
purchased from your supplier of raw materials for lathe work. Engineering supply 
firms should carry it. Get PVC if you can. <BR>

  </TBODY></TABLE>The pictures show the worlds first polystyrene substrate 
anode made by Stefano Lissa. The substrate was part of a floppy drive. The cell 
is an open cell and the connection is protected and sealed by a mixture of 
solvent and polystyrene. It was an experimental set up.
<P>To make the plastic conductive it is painted with a solvent that melts a 
layer of the plastic and it is then rolled in a excess of dry lead dioxide 
powder. You should use plenty of dry powder at this stage. Don't be tempted to 
rub off the excess from the anode at this stage. The excess can be removed when 
the solvent is fully dry. Try not to 'disturbe' the layer of solvent/melted 
plastic when applying the powder. A handy solvent that will melt most plastics, 
including PVC, is plumers glue which is available at the hardware store. It is a 
mixture of MEK, and Tetrahydrofurvan. <BR>Connections are applied as described 
elsewhere on this page and it is plated. Metal connections will not give as many 
problems as with the porous ceramic substrates when the anode goes into service 
as there will be no conduction of salts up the plastic substrate.<BR>The anode 
is plated in the usual manner, as per the ceramic substrate anodes. There can be 
a problem with the plating solution creeping up the powered anode and corroding 
the connection that is make to the anode for to plate it. This will not be a 
problem if you are using a graphite connection when you are plating the anode. 
If not, the best method is to plate about one inch of one end of the anode and 
then turn the anode upsidedown and make a good connection to this small (inch 
long) plate and then plate the rest of the anode.
