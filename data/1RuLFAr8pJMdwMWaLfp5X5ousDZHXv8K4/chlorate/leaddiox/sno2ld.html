The layer of Doped Tin Oxide is applied by painting on a fixed ratio solution of Tin and dopant compounds 
that are thermally decomposed into the Oxides. A layer of Alpha Lead Dioxide is plated next using an alkali
 Lead salt bath or perhaps a Lead Nitrate bath at a high current density. Next and lastly a Beta layer of Lead Dioxide is plated on top using a Lead Nitrate plating bath. The Alpha layer has better adherent properties that the Beta. It is also smoother and levels better. The Beta is better for exposure to the Chlorate or Perchlorate cell electrolyte as it wears less.<br>
 The substrate can be a drilled flat sheet of Ti. Mesh should be OK. Another possible alternative is to obtain a quantity of Ti welding rods.
They can be had from you local welding supplier as a special order or as a sample. You can then 'weave' the rods together to form a mesh with, say,
0.3 cm square holes, the mesh  being the size of the Anode you want. You can weave more/less dense as you think fit. The Ti rods that are horizontal will play no part in taking current to the Anode, it all being done by the vertical rods. <br>
The Ti must be surface treated before any coatings are applied by 
degreasing, etching and (if possible) sandblasting.<br>



It should be noted that certain Tin and Antimony compounds are toxic. This is especially true if you
attempt to make your own compounds from Tin and Antimony metals + acids. <p>


The picture below shows an Anode made with a drilled 1mm thick Ti substrate. The small depressions on the <br>
surface give an indication of the spacing of the holes which were 2.5mm diameter.  The Anode measures 5 cm by 30 cm.<p>

(In relation to the Anode)<br>
The process that I finally settled upon is a bit laborious but I have had pretty consistent results:<br>

I used Ti sheet of about 1mm thickness because that is what I had at the time. A little thicker would 
probably be better.<br>

The first step involves drilling the solid sheet full of small holes. I used a piece of perforated 
stainless as a drilling guide/pattern. The holes then need to be de-burred or slightly countersunk to 
get rid of the ragged edges left by the drilling step; I just used a larger diameter drill bit to do this.<br>

The substrate should then be sandblasted, (to help the PbO2 adhere to it. The holes are needed for the 
same reason) degreased with dish-washing soap, thoroughly rinsed in clean water and dried.<br>

Next, a semiconducting coat of Sb doped SnO<small>2</small> was applied by painting on a solution 
of SnCl<small>4</small> + SbCl<small>3</small> in water + Butanol, drying, and then heating to 500&deg;C or so in an oxidizing atmosphere i.e. air. This step was repeated five to ten times to give a 
suitable coating thickness.<br>

Then a thin (about 0.1mm) layer of Alpha PbO<small>2</small> was plated onto the substrate from an
alkaline lead tartrate bath. <br>

The final coat of beta PbO<small>2</small> was then plated over top of this from a lead nitrate bath.
 This layer was about 2mm thick.<p>

The Anode performed well in a perchlorate cell.<br>
The Anode above was only used for two batches of perchlorate, starting from NaClO3, which means that
 it has seen about 200 hours of use at a current of 35-40 A. It still looks pretty much exactly the same.
 I have made other Anodes (using the same process) that I've used in Chlorate cells for hundreds of hours 
with no visible signs of wear.<br>

The Alpha PbO<small>2</small> layer was added in order to improve adhesion + uniformity of the final beta 
PbO<small>2</small> layer.
See US5683567 for a description of a very similar anode.
I used to always try and cut corners but after accumulating a whole lot of hazardous waste from failed
 attempts I've come to realize that it is easier to do it properly, even if it is more work.<br>

I chose the SnO<small>2</small>/Sb<small>2</small>O<small>3</small> system because it is easy to apply
and the raw materials are easy to come by and above all cheap. SnO<small>2</small> also has a higher
Oxygen overvoltage than PbO<small>2</small> which supposedly means that any exposed SnO<small>2</small>
will not interfere with the Anodic formation of Perchlorate. </i><p></table>

<h4>Drilling Titanium</h4>
<ul>How easy Ti is to drill will depend on grade. Grade one is easy (for small holes anyways) and can be drilled with ordinary steel drill bits, Grade 4 is difficult. <br>
Quote:<br>
CP titanium won't start out very hard, but it will work harden rapidly, faster than 304 or 316 stainless steel. I'd recommend a high speed center drill, especially if you do not have a drill press or milling machine. Carbide will just break up if you try to drill by hand. Drill speed should be 800-1200 rpm for a 1/8" hole, 1/16 would be twice that, 1/4 would be 400-600. Scale accordingly. Use heavy feed and don't hesitate, as each turn of the drill should peel up a chip at least 0.004 thick. Otherwise the material will harden under the drill point.</ul>

<h4>Etching Titanium</h4>
<ul>
If the Titanium has been coated before it may require  a greater time in the etching bath for to get rid of the previous coating(s). If the Ti has been handled much or there is cutting oil on it, it must be degreased first before etching starts. This can be performed with kitchen cleaner and a scouring pad. The Ti should then be washed down with dishwasher detergent.<br>
The grades of Ti that are alloyed with Al (usually 6Al4V, meaning 6% Al & 4% Vanadium) is easy to etch in 12% HCl at room temperature once you start it off by sandpapering the Ti. Grade one is more difficult with the 12% HCl needing to be at a minimum of 85C. Heat the acid first and then put Ti into it. If the acid is heated from room temperature with the Ti in the acid it will not etch. If the Ti is sandpapered before going into acid this will guarantee a start to etching. It is probably best to use 20% HCl to hurry things up. A pot of 12% HCl left to boil will become 20% HCl as the water boils away. <br>
Grade four is very difficult to etch with hot HCl having no effect. It can be etched using molten NaOH or HF acid (BOTH DANGEROUS). A product which may be useful for etching Ti is a paste sold in welding shops for cleaning Stainless Steel after it is welded. It contains HF & Nitric Acid.  It may be called CromeBrite or some such. It has been stated that Titanium can also be etched using a mixture of Ammonium Persulphate + Sodium Flouride.<br>
Oxalic acid can also be used to etch Ti. A 10% solution in water has been used. It has been claimed that Oxalic acid gives a superior etch as it attacks the Ti grain bounderies more aggressively that HCl. Heat to 80&deg;C or more before placing Ti into the etch bath.<p>
When etched the Ti can be washed. <b> Use distilled water or perhaps solvent. Do not use raw water as the Ti must be kept very clean at this stage. </b>Keep the Titanium held in such a way so that the unetched (top) part is at the bottom so that no run-off comes from the unetched area onto the etched part. This caused streaks and may stop ATO from forming. Washing the etched Ti in clean 12% HCl and not drying (give it a shake and stop run-off from unetched part to etched part) before applying the ATO percursor has also been succussful at this stage. <br>
Most sources dry the Ti at this stage.</ul>

Note:<br>
Titanium does not permit films to be prepared at higher temperatures that 500&deg;C because the interface
 undergoes a sort of swelling and the over-layer becomes fragile and scales. Keep below 500&deg;C.<br>
