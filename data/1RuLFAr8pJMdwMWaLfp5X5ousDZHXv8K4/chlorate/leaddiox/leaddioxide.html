 <FONT SIZE=5> A</font>n insoluble Anode that is relatively cheap, easy to make, reliable, and long lasting 
 for the manufacture of Chlorate's and Perchlorate's has long been sought after by the non-professional. 
 The Lead Dioxide Anode (the Poor Mans Platinum)  is one way to go. <br>
There are a number of different types and methods of construction of the Lead Dioxide Anode 
that have found use in industry.
The usual type of Lead Dioxide Anode that was used in the past by the big producers of Chlorate's 
and Perchlorate's had Graphite and Ti substrates. The Graphite 
substrate Lead Dioxide (GSLD) Anode requires a high quality thick coat of  Lead Dioxide to protect the Graphite
 from the Chlorate/Perchlorate electrolyte. It also needs a high quality , hard and dense Graphite  
 (although home producers have used battery carbons) in order to have a high reliability. Gouging rods
 are NOT acceptable. <br>
The original patent that was issued by a major Chlorate and Perchlorate manufacturer to make Graphite Substrate Anodes is 
US 2,945,791 and is available in the 'further reading section'. (see also US 3,463,707) It uses a well controlled setup. 
<br>Amateurs have found it very  difficult to obtain a GSLD Anode 
that has lasted long in an electrolytic cell. The Anodes appear to be OK when plated but fail after a 
time when used. That's not to say that it cannot be done.<p>
The Ti substrate Anode needs an precoat between the LD and the Ti as LD will oxidize Ti metal. An adherent coating of Lead Dioxide  is also required. 
Ti substrate Lead Dioxide Anodes that have been successful in industry have 
had a coating of Platinum metal or Pt Oxide  applied to the Ti before being coated with 
Lead Dioxide. An alternative to the Pt/Pt Oxide is a semiconductor coating of doped Tin Oxide. This is 
applied by painting and thermal decomposition. Another alternative is to coat an existing (purchased) MMO Anode with LD. 
<BR>Massive Lead Dioxide Anodes (Anodes having no substrate) have also been proposed and are  long 
lasting once a successful Anode has been produced. The problem here is that it is difficult to make
 massive Anodes of the required size that have no flaws, a tiny flaw or crack will cause the hard brittle
 Anode to fail by breaking.
 <br> Plastic and ceramic substrate anodes were proposed in order to obtain Anodes that did not require a 
 perfect coating of Lead Dioxide.
The ceramic substrate Anode was not a success as the porous substrate conducts salts up to the connection 
when it goes into service. It also requires a reasonably good coating of Lead Dioxide in order to carry the
 heavy currents when used in a Chlorate or Perchlorate cell. The plastic substrate Anode has the same problem of 
 requiring a good coat of Lead Dioxide to carry heavy currents.<p>
  Anodes that have an inert reinforcing fibre mesh  as a substrate are being tried. The  
 type of Anode will be 'forgiving', unlike  Anodes with Graphite  as the substrate where a less than 
 perfect coating of Lead Dioxide gives inevitable failure  once it goes into service. 
 They are comparable to massive Anodes but with the added reinforcing of the inert fiber mesh or other substance. A valve metal with no precoat could also be used so long as the long term electrical connection is not made to the valve metal.
 <p>
<u>The current state of thinking is this:</u><p><ul>


Ti substrate Anodes using the Sb doped Tin Oxide precoat or a purchased MMO precoat. Ti substrate is a mesh or drilled flat sheet. 
First an Alpha  then a Beta Lead Dioxide coating is applied. Good control of plating baths. Since Ti 
is readily available this may be the best way to go. These Anodes are very rugged and will continue to work even if Valve metal is exposed.<P>

Inert mesh reinforced massive  Anodes are a viable alternative for the Amateur. Good success has been reported using plastic domestic 'pot scrub' material as the reinforcing mesh.<p>

Graphite substrate made correctly using a good grade of graphite and a semi professional plating setup. No corner cutting on temperature 
control etc. Steady Lead ion concentration in the electrolyte (use large bath or/and compound addition) and not too much 
pH/Nitric acid concentration variation (use large bath or/and compound addition). Use surfactant and put on a thick coat (min. 3mm) of LD. Expect failure! See US Pat. US  2945791<p></ul>
One guy has used the LDSLDA (Lead Dioxide substrate Lead Dioxide Anode). Scrap Lead Dioxide pieces 
from previous Anodes are but into a porous bag, a Graphite rod is put down on top and the bag and some
 of the rod is plated. Success has been varied with some Anodes lasting hours, some lasting months. 
 The system has the advantage that you will not need a very well controlled plating tank/set up. See 
 <a href="ldslda.html"> here</a>. <p>
 
 The Magnetite substrate 
 Lead Dioxide Anode may be workable. It appears that when a solid piece of Lead Dioxide is simply attached to a piece of
Magnetite and placed into a Perchlorate cell it will function as a successful Anode.
See <a href="ldonmag.html"> here</a> for details.<p>
<p> See <a href="alfabeta.html"> here</a> for more info on Lead Dioxide types. <p>
 
<hr> All lead compounds are toxic, particularly the soluble compounds like Lead Nitrate, Acetate, etc. 
They have a cumulative effect (the damage builds up) on your nervous system. See
<a href="poison.html"> LEAD POISON</a> for more info. <hr><p>
The following general rules should be followed when using the Lead Dioxide Anode.<p>
<ul><li>
 It is probably best to keep the CD below 300mA per sqauare cm as Anode wear gets greater and greater as CD goes up.
<li> It is probably best not to use Fluoride (in Perchlorate cells) with a Titanium substrate Anode as erosion of substrate will take place. Use Sulphuric acid instead or a Persulphate salt if you want to use an additive. See JES Aug 61 (further reading section). (NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THAT)
<li>Keep temperature below 50&deg;C. Destruction of an Anode occured at 74&deg;C according to JES Aug 61 (further reading section).
<li>
High pH will increase Anode erosion and above a pH of 11 Anode dissolution occurs according to JES Aug 61 (see further reading section). The pH of Sodium Perchlorate cells drifts alkaline and can rise up to 11 over a period of a day or so. High pH is associated with Chloride in the cell.
<li>Keep Chloride in Perchlorate cells to a minimum as this will  give a longer life to the Anode IMO.
<li>
Be aware that their may be small quantities of soluble Lead in a Perchlorate cell that has been run with a Lead Dioxide Anode. A small quantity of Sulphate added to the cell will cause any Lead ions to precipitate as Lead Sulphate.<p>
</ul>
