<h2> Titanium substrate Lead Dioxide Anode with ATO interface layer (III)</h2></center>
<hr size=20  color=grey><br><p>
<table><tr><td>
The previous Anode was a failure due to plating rig problems. The Alpha bath also refused to give a good even coating of Alpha Lead Dioxide so it was decided not to use an Alkali Alpha bath but rather to use a Lead Nitrate bath throughout for this Anode. Alpha LD can be deposited from the Lead Nitrate bath if you use a high current density (60mA per square cm) and if the acid concentration is from 18 to 30 grams per litre. I am not 100% sure if I did achieve Alpha LD as I do not know if Alpha LD is deposited from the Lead Nitrate bath when acid is at the lower concentration that my bath was run at (about 10 grams per liter, pH 0.8). pH was checked with a professional meter/probe and was calibrated.<br><p>
A piece of Titanium was coated with ATO and placed into the Lead Nitrate bath. The power supply (constant current type) was connected to the Anode and Cathodes before placing the Anode into the tank.
There were no Nitrites at the start of plating as shown by Aquarium testing kit.<br><p>
A pumping rate 17ml per minute per Amp was required when the pH of the plating tank was kept at around pH = 0.9. The pH of the neutralizing tank was around 3.6.  <br>
A wet solid paste of Lead Carbonate and Copper Carbonate was kept added in excess to the N Tank. If the Carbonates are not whetted before hand they are sometimes inclined to float on top of the Nitrate fluid and can cause quite an irritating mess. <br><p>
Some green insulating tape was wound around the substrate so that the LD would have an abrupt end. The fluid level in allowed to fall anywhere on the tape and plating will commence at the bottom edge of the tape. This is not a good idea as the Lead Dioxide grows up around and over the tape (as seen in photo) and has no support. A plastic baffle would be better or perhaps nothing at all which usually gives a tapered edge to the Lead Dioxide.<br><p>

The plating set up is shown in the picture. It contains two liters of fluid. It is a  ghetto type of set up but done the job OK. Containers are PE. The P-Tank is the plating tank and consisted of a 2.5 liter can with the top cut off. A perspex sheet was placed in the bottom and hot-melted to give a good flat bottom for the magnetic stirrer bar to function. The N-Tank (neutral) is just a one litre can with half inch holes cut half way down and covered with a polyester cloth to act as a filter. This N-Tank is placed inside the P-Tank. Do not use cable ties (Nylon?) in the plating tank as they become brittle after approx. 24 hours and break. Silicon sealer fails too. The plastic air-stone used to agitate a tank broke too. The plating solution is aggressive toward certain plastics, so beware. Teflon tape is good for tyeing things if needed.<br>
The Anode is not shown in the tank. Perspex beads can be seen floating on top of the Lead Nitrate/Copper Nitrate solution. They were put in to scrub bubbles off the Anode as it plated but stirring was not violent enough for this and they just sat on top. They served  two good purposes by slowing evaporation and stopping the (toxic) spray from rising from the surface of the plating liquid caused by bubbles. A cover (not shown) was put on the tank when in use. <BR>
A Ti Cathode is visible at the edge of the tank. There were two and they got coated with Copper. The peristaltic pump was on a timer and pumped fluid from the P-Tank to the N-Tank. (Silicon tubing is OK.) The (more neutral) fluid then returned to the P Tank via three large holes that were cut approx. half way down the N-Tank. These holes were covered with a band of polyester cloth that acted as a filter to stop solid Lead Carbonate (and Cu Carbonate) coming into the plating tank.<br>
A constant current power supply was used to run current to Anode. The current was adjusted as the Anode got bigger to keep the plating current density in the region of 20mA per square cm (Beta LD). Current was run at 60mA per square cm for the first two hours to give Alpha (hopefully?) LD. <BR>
Some Copper Nitrate was added directly to the P-Tank as few times as the blue colour was getting very weak.<br>
Temperature of tanks was around 67&deg;C with the heater set to about 210&deg;C. The liquid in the oval glass dish ('Pyrex' from hardware store) was mainly water but had a layer of 'liquid paraffin' (veterinary product) floating on top to stop evaporation. The water had some Ammonium Sulphate dissolved in it so that if any Lead Nitrate was slobbered into it, the Lead was converted to insoluble Lead Sulphate. <BR>
A magnetic stirrer bar was in the bottom of the P-Tank under the Anode.  It was discovered that as plating progressed the Lead Carbonate + Copper Carbonate was sitting in the bottom of the N-Tank and needed stirring up. A drill was set up to stir this tank  (messy) and put on the same timer driving the pump so that it did not run all the time. A better stirrer would be needed for to keep the Carbonates stirred. I was afraid to put the stirrer too near the bottom as there was lots of torque with the stirrer and if it snagged the tank the entire plating setup would have landed on the floor (not a pretty sight). A magnetic stirrer bar would be best. An aquarium air pump with an air stone (common plastic air stones fail!) helps of you don't have a magnetic stirrer.<br><img src="substrate.gif" align=left   alt="[Diagram of drilled Ti substrate]"><p>
The Ti substrate had a Tin Oxide coating applied as per the last Anode. The substrate was very narrow and a bit too thick at 2 MM. It would have been better if is was 1.5 MM as perhaps the holes would have plated better and filled in completely.  The holes in the substrate were 4mm dia. and were counter sunk a small amount (not enough). The substrate had a surface area of 16cm squared and weighed 8.2 grams. It measured 8cm by 0.2cm by 0.8cm. [edit] The substrate proved too thick and should be tapered at the edge more IMO with perhaps serations or 'semi-holes' drilled at the edges something like the diagram.

<BR><p>
An Alkali Alpha LD bath was not used and instead a high current density was used for the first two hours to give an (hopefully) Alpha coat.  High current density also causes a high density of initial nucleation sites on the substrate. <br>
Nitrites started to show up after approx. one half hour. Minimum (Red Lead) was added to the N-Tank as it is stated that they will counteract the Nitrite problem. I have no idea if it helped but it seemed to have. The current efficiency for the plating job was very high (99%!) so Nitrites seemed not to be a problem at all.<br><p>
The total plating time was 23.4 hours. Total Ah's passed was 12.407 (0.463 moles). Total LD plated 55.3 grams. This works out at 99%CE. (one mole LD = 239.2g and two moles of e<sup>-</sup> are required per mole LD). It would appear that Nitrites are not a problem if Red Lead is used in the tank. Nitrites lower plating current efficiency and perhaps give bad wearing coats of LD.<br>

This picture shows a similar substrate but not the actual substrate that was coated.<br>

The bottom of the Anode looks like a Meteorite.<br>

The finished Anode has the classic 'shimmering velvet' look of new Lead Dioxide.<br>
The surface area of the Anode is 36.2cm squared which if worked at 150mA per square cm (conservative) will give a 5.4 Amp Anode. <br>
The weight of the Anode when dry (before use, including connection) was 84 grams.<br> <p>

<center><H2>Using the Anode</h2></center>
<h3><FONT COLOR=RED>Run One</font></h3>
<p>
The Anode was put into a Sodium Chlorate 3.8 liter cell that had (approx.) 600 grams per liter Sodium Perchlorate + 6.7g/l Chlorate  and run at 5 Amps (approx. 140mA per square cm). The Chloride level would have been low but not measured. Cell temperature was around 32&deg;C. The two  Cathodes of Ti mesh (old MMO) had approx. 60cm squared surface area (four sides total). 
<br>This was a 'Chlorate scavenging' role for the Anode.  50% Sulphuric acid solution was added to the cell at the start both as a pH reducer and as an additive to improve CE. On addition of Sulphuric acid a precipitate was observed. There was dissolved Lead from previous Lead Dioxide Anode runs. Sulphuric acid was added until there was no more precipitate. The cell was decanted and started again. The pH was 3.3. The pH hovered in the region of 4.4 until the cell was finished without any need to add acid. Over the next 104 hours the Chlorate concentration was reduced from the 6.7 figure to 2.9 grams per liter. A %CE of 1.43%. Over the next 70 hours the Chlorate concentration was reduced from 2.9 to 0.84 grams per liter. A %CE of 1%.
<br> The cell run was deemed finished.

<h3><FONT COLOR=RED>Run Two</font></h3>
Another cell was set up as above by simply adding some Sodium Chlorate to the cell. The concentration of Sodium Chlorate was 7.3 grams per liter. Cathodes as above. This was a 'Chlorate scavenging' role for the Anode. This cell was run at a high pH to see if it made any dramatic changes to the %CE. 3.7grams NaOH was added to the cell and this raised the pH from 3.7 to 10.5. It stayed around 10 for the duration of the run. <BR>
The Chlorate concentration fell by 2.16 grams per liter over the first 43.5 hours (Chlorate conc. now 5.14g/l) which was a %CE of 1.9%. Over the four   days the concentration of Chlorate was reduced to 1.6 grams per liter, a %CE of 1.4%. There is no advantage in operating a Perchlorate cell which has a very low concentration of Chlorate ('Chlorate scavenging') at a high pH. Also bear in mind that it has been reported that Anode dissolution occurs at a pH of 11. <br> The cell was let run for another two days. The Chloride (Cl<sup>-</sup>) concentration of the Cell was checked at the end of the run and found to be less than 0.5 grams per liter.<br>
The cell was let run for another 4 days and shut down. The Voltage across the cell at the end of run was 4.62 Volts.<br>The Anode had been running for a total of 3 weeks. The Anode was dried and weighed and had lost no weight (still 84 grams). <p>

<h3><FONT COLOR=RED>Run Three</font></h3>
<table><tr><td>
<img src="s_anode_40.jpg" border=1  alt="[Anode at 40 days]"><p></td><td>
A cell the same as above was set up by simply adding some Sodium Chlorate to the 3.8 liter cell. This was another 'Chlorate scavenging' run.  The current density on the Anode was raised to 280mA per square cm (it was 140 for the previous two runs). This give a current into the cell of 10 Amps. The cell was kept cool by placing it into a container of water and it ran at approx. 37&deg;C. There was still Sulphate  (improves CE) in the cell from previous additions of Sulphuric acid (I presumed).<br>

The Chlorate concentration at the run start was 20 grams per liter as measured with a titration. The Perchlorate concentration was in the region of 600 grams per liter (not actually measured). Chloride concentration was close to zero. <br>
 The Voltage across the cell at startup (36.5&deg;C) was  5.34 Volts.<br> 
 The Voltage across the cell at the end of the run (35.2&deg;C) was 5.5 Volts.<br></table>
 After 29 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 11.2 grams per liter, a CE of 5.8%<br>
 After another 23 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 8 grams per liter, a CE of 2.7%<br>
 After another 26 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 6 grams per liter, a CE of 1.5%<br>
 After another 67 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 2.3 grams per liter, a CE of 1.05%<br>
 After another 51 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 1.2 grams per liter, a CE of 0.4%<br>
 After another 94 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 0.4 grams per liter, a CE of 0.16%<br>
 The cell was let run for another day and stopped. <p>
 The pH of the cell at the start was five. 2cc of 12% HCl was added which lowered pH to 2.5. After one day pH was
5 and 1cc acid was added to lower pH to 2.5. Another  24 hours later pH was 7.2 and 2cc acid was added to take pH to 2.5. Seventy two hours later pH was still 2.5 and had decreased to 2.0 just before the cell was stopped.<br><p>

A white deposit formed on the Cathodes which could be brushed off easily. Lead Sulphate perhaps?<br>
The cell liquor was crystal clear with a very small deposit of light brown stuff on the cell bottom. This deposit was filtered in a dried and weighed filter paper and was 0.15 grams when dried. Composition unknown.<br>
The Anode was dried with a paper towel and let sit for an hour or so to dry and then weighed and found to be 83.7 grams, a weight loss of 0.3 grams. <p>
</table>


<h3><FONT COLOR=RED>Run Four</font></h3>
Another cell was set up to perform another 'Chlorate scavenging' task by simply adding some Chlorate to the 3.8 liter cell above. There was still Sulphate in the cell from previous runs (I presumed). The current density on the Anode was reduced to 83mA per square cm (3 Amps into the 3.8 litre cell). The cell was not put into a bucket of water for cooling purposes as there was no need. The starting Chlorate concentration was 16.6 grams per liter. After some hours of operation the Voltage across the cell was  4.16 Volts @20.2&deg;C. Starting pH was 2.5.<br>
After 139 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 12.1g/l, a %CE of 2.0% (relatively low).<br>
After another 103 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 10.5g/l, a %CE of 1.0% (relatively low).<br>
Eight grams of Potassium Persulphate (35.5cc of a 225g/l solution) was added to the cell at this stage to see would it make any difference with CE (see JES 1958). The addition caused no Chlorine gas to come out of the cell.<br>
After another 94 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was measured at 8.4g/l, a %CE of 1.4% (still very low).<br>
Current going into the cell was increased at this point to five Amps (Anode CD  = 140mA per square cm). After another 114 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was measured at 4.62g/l, a CE of 1.27% which is similar to cell runs above at this Anode current density.<br>
The %CE of this cell was very poor when the current density on the Anode was at 83mA per square cm but was OK (at least it was comparable to cell runs above) when the CD was increased back up to 140mA per square cm. <br> The self stirring action of the cell was poor due to the fact that not as much gassing was going on at the electrodes when compared to other cells with more Amps (>3 Amps) being fed to the Anode. Perhaps this made a difference (guess). The 'current concentration' (the Amps per liter of cell) is a figure that gets quoted in the literature. The current concentration was very very low for this cell. The whole process (Chlorate scavenging) was of course slowed down even more by the fact that there was only 3 Amps going into the cell (as opposed to 10 Amps for a cell run above). <br>
There was a deposit of white material on the mesh Cathodes that could be easily brushed off using a toothbrush.<br>
The next run will be stirred to see of there are any gains to be had.<br>
The pH of this cell run was 1.2 at the end of run without any acid being added to the cell. It ran at a temperature of around 21&deg;C without any external cooling.<br><P>

<P><h3><FONT COLOR=RED>Run 	Five</font></h3>

Another 'Chlorate scavenging' run was started by simply adding Chlorate to the cell described above. This time stirring was used to see if it made any difference to the %CE. A magnetic stirrer bar was used and a sheet of glass was placed in the cell bottom to stop the bar from drilling a hole (as it does!) in the bottom of the plastic container. It was assumed there was still Sulphate in the cell from the previous run(s). Current density on the Anode was put at 200mA per square cm (7.14 Amps into the 3.8 liter cell). <br>
After 6.5 days of operation the Chlorate concentration had fallen to 5.9g/l (down from 19.8g/l), a %CE of 2.4% (not very good).<br>
After another 3 days of operation the Chlorate concentration was at 2.44g/l, a %CE of 1.3% (similar to comparable non-stirred cells above).<br>
After another 82 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was 0.53g/l, a %CE of 0.62%.<br>
The cell was stopped at this point.
The pH of the cell was about 1.8 throughout the run. The temperature was around 28&deg;C.<br>
Stirring of the cell seems to be of no help to increase %CE.<br>
The Anode was washed, dried and weighed and found to have lost  0.2 grams over the period since it was last weighed. The Anode now weighed 83.5 grams.<br><p>

  <img src="cracked_2.jpg" align = right border=1  alt="[Cracked Anode + End]"><p>
  Another cell was cranked up using recycled Salt + Chlorate solids and solutions of Chlorate from various sources. The cell container was the same as in the runs above, 3.8 liters, mesh Cathodes etc. Current into the cell was a constant 7.14 Amps, 200mA per square cm Anode current density. There were no additives added but it was not known if additives were in any of the 'slops' that were put together to make up the cell liquor. <br>
  The cell was let run for 13 days before any measurements were taken.<br>
  The Chlorate concentration was measured at 470g/l on day 13. The starting Chlorate concentration was  very high but was not measured.<br>
  On day 13 it was noticed that pieces of Lead Dioxide had fallen off the top and the bottom of the Anode. The electrolyte has a lot of brown foam on the surface. There may have been contaminants in the liquor as it had come from a number of unknown sources. Not much cell monitoring was carried out in regard to %CE.<br>
  After another 126 hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was measured at 304g/l, a %CE of 35%.<br>
  After another 94  hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was measured at 156g/l, a %CE of 42%.<br>
  After another 345  hours of operation the Chlorate concentration was measured at 20 g/l, a %CE of 10.6%.<br>
  The cell was run for another 8 days and was deemed finished. The liquor containing mostly Perchlorate  + a small amount of Chlorate was boiled down and added to another Perchlorate cell.<p><br>
  
  
  The pH of the cell could be kept around neutral for the first few days my adding approx. 10cc of acid per day.
  On day 19 the pH was measured at 8.8 so acid was added to reduce the pH. A total of 80cc of acid was added in lots of 20cc to take the pH to 7.1. There seemed to be some buffering action taking place. The next day the pH was at 7.5 so 20cc of acid was added to take the pH to 7.3. Two days later pH was 7.4 so 10cc acid added.
  On day 22 (cell at 156g/l Chlorate) the pH was at 10.5, 40cc acid was added to take the pH to 2.0.
  Four days later the pH was at 3.8 so 15cc acid added. Ten days later (20g/l Chlorate) the pH was at 1.50 and stayed in that region until the cell finished.<br>
  There was a small build up of white deposit on the mesh Cathodes. The starting contents of this cell came from sources of unknown history. <p>
  
  
  The Anode was inspected at the end of the run and found to have some large cracks as shown in the picture. The 'meteorite' of Lead Dioxide had fallen off the bottom and the nodules of Lead Dioxide that had grown over the insulation tape (green) at the Anode top had partially fallen off (day 13) as stated above (see picture).<br> </td></tr></table>

  <table><tr><td>
  
  
  
  <img src="split.jpg"  align = left border = 1   alt="[De-laminated Anode]">
  
  A cell containing dissolved Potassium Chloride was started up to run up some time on the Anode.

   Two pieces of Teflon tape were tied around the Anode where the cracks were to help to stop it from splitting any further.
The cell was pH controlled at around 6.90 and ran at a modest five Amps.  After three days of operation the Anode was inspected and was as shown in the picture. The Anode had met it's Waterloo!<BR>
 It was assumed that making Potassium Chlorate did not seem to 'agree' with it, as making Sodium Perchlorate would not (IMO) have caused the de-lamination of the LD to have happened so rapidly if at all. Perhaps solid K Chlorate is  inclined to precipitate between the LD and the substrate and heave out the LD? The LD was riped from the sides of the substrate leaving behind 'bushings' of Lead Dioxide in the substrate holes as shown in the picture. The Lead Dioxide between the two Teflon tyeings was bulged out not unlike bulging rust on Iron.<br> Potassium Chlorate can be seen on the Cathodes.<BR>
  <img src="ld_bushings.jpg"   border = 1   alt="[LD BUSHINGS]"><p>
 This Anode has been in operation for a total of 112 days.<p>
 </td></tr> </table>
  
  
  
 

<br><p><hr>
Judging from the runs above, Sodium Chlorate 'scavenging' is a very low %CE task. Increasing the current density on the Anode from 140 to 280mA per square cm  lowered   %CE a bit but it allowed the cell to finish quicker. Lowering the CD to  83mA per square cm give an even worse CE%.
Stirring of the cell did not improve %CE. Advantages of adding Persulphate were little or none as shown with the MMO substrate (not the Anode described here) Anode described elsewhere, during cell runs No. Three versus No. Four. <br>
This Anode is giving a low current efficiency (%CE). It should be higher IMO. Perhaps adding a surfactant to the plating tank would help? Perhaps the presence of the Read Lead (Minum) in the tank is giving  Lead Dioxide which has very low catalytic activity? Perhaps you NEED some Nitrites in the plating tank?

<br>It is advisable to keep pH at neutral or lower in Perchlorate cells as it has been reported that a pH of 11 can cause Anode dissolution but controlling the pH of Perchlorate cells is a black art. I have not seen any Anode dissolution even though the cells were at high pH for long periods of time.<br>Keep temperature below 50&deg;C as it has also been reported that high temperatures can cause Anode dissolution. <br>Best not to make Potassium Chlorate with LD Anodes?!<br>
Some more effort would need to be put into preparing the Ti substrate by tapering the edges and rounding off the bottom. A 'proper' Alpha coating (from an Alkali Lead plating bath) may also help with adhesion of the LD to the substrate.<p>
