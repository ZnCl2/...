<h1 align=center> Mixed Metal Oxide (MMO) Anode in action</H1>


The Anode shown here is a 'wire' type corrosion control electrode. It has a Copper core surrounded <br>
by Ti with a MMO on top. The coating is black in colour. It would seem that Ir Oxide is black and the Ir<br>
 Oxide prevents the coating from being stripped off when Anode is used in dilute (brackish) solutions <br>
 or even in clean water. The Anode current densities in corrosion control are less than that in a<br>
 Chlorate cell.<p>
Below, the Ti with Copper core can be seen. The anode wire is 3mm Dia. <br>
The welding rods are Ti of 1.5mm Dia.<p>

A computer supply, 5 Volts, was used to run the Anode. A diode was connected in series to reduce the,<BR> 
current to 8 amps. Anode was run about 240mA per square cm.  Temperature was about 25C. Volume of cell<BR>
 about 3.4 litres.<br>
K Chlorate precipitated from cell about 24 hours after cell was started. <BR>
There appeared to be damage to the surface of the anode after a single run.<br>
 It appeared as if a part of the MMO coating  on the upward facing surface of the anode near the top of<br>
 liquid was  eroded away. It is difficult to tell. The area concerned still emitted gas when in use.<P>
 The cell was run a second time. Saturated solution (18C) of KCl used. Current was reduced to 4.1amps.<br>
 Approx. 125mA/cm squared. 
 The cell was run for approx. 1.5 days until K Chlorate began to precipitate out.<br> The cell was cooled to 
 15C and the ppt was filtered out<br>
 The cell was run for a further 10 days, cooled to 15C and the K Chlorate filtered, dried and weighed. Current <br>
efficiency was measured (based on yield of K Chlorate above) to be 65%. No pH control. No additives (like <br>
Fluoride or Persulphate) added.<br>
