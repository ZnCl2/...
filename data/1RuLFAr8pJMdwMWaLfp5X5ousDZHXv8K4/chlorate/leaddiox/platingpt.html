<H1 align=center>Plating Titanium with Platinum</H1><br><p><br>
The following is from "Metals Handbook"<br>
Pt is used in the Chlorine-Caustic industry where a thickness of Pt of from 0.05 to 0.1 mils is used. Replating of the anodes may be required every two years depending on operating conditions. The attrition rate of Pt appears to be about 0.5 grams of Pt per ton Chlorine produced.<br>
Several Platinum and Electrode suppliers have developed reliable methods for Platinum plating Titanium; most employ proprietary solutions.<br> A Platinum Diamino Nitrate bath has been used successfully to apply Platinum plates to Titanium. In this and other procedures, however, certain precautionary steps are required, to achieve adherent, uniform plates. The surface must be cleaned thoroughly and etched in HCl or HF acid to produce a roughened surface. Some procedures also involve a surface activating treatment just prior to plating. Immersion for 4 minutes in a solution of Glacial Acetic acid (895 ml) containing HF (125 ml of 52% HF), followed by a prompt rinse, appears to be an effective activating treatment if performed immediately prior to plating. A post-plating treatment, consisting of heating to 750 to 1000F (400 to 540C) for a period of 10 to 60 minutes, stress relieves the plate and improves adhesion. This treatment can be performed in the air atmosphere where a light Oxide film will form on unplated areas.<br>
I have also been told that when Ti is being plated with Pt, the Ti must go from the etch bath to the plating bath immediately (when still wet) so that no Oxide can form.<br><p>
