<h2>Sodium Chlorate cell with MMO Anode run to low Chloride concentration </h2>

A cell was run with an MMO Anode until the Chloride concentration was very low in order to ascertain what 
the current efficiency would be as the Chloride concentration decreased. 
The MMO was of unknown quality as it was second hand but it functioned OK as a Chlorate maker
 non the less. <br>
 Temperature of cell was approx. 60&deg;C, volume was 2.2 litres, current was 8 Amps (constant), pH was held
 around 7.1 by dripping 12% HCl into cell at a rate of 1.1cc per hour. Chloride in cell at the start of the run was 294 grams per litre. <br>
 Titration's were started when Chlorate concentration was at 241 grams per litre (= approx. 160 grams per litre Na Chloride) and was 
 run for a further 9 days.
 <br><b>On day nine the Anode passivated (failed!!).<br></b>
 The current efficiency was not very high at any time with this Anode. First 5.3 days, CE was 79% with Chloride now at approx. 160g/l. Next 143 hours, CE was 65% with Chloride now at 47g/l . Next 38 hours, CE was 51% with Chloride concentration now at 21g/l.<br> It would appear that MMO is a good Anode at lowering Chloride concentration to low levels but it is foolish to use it to lower Chloride below 80 or so grams per litre as you are going to damage the Anode.Industry stays above 100g/l Chloride. The Chloride concentration in this cell at the point where the Anode passivated  was 21 grams per litre Sodium Chlorate. A new properly coated Anode is not going to fail first time if you do leave it in a cell with low  Chloride concentration but you will not know the MMO constitution of your Anode and/or it's ability to withstand low Chloride concentrations.<br>
 MMO may be like Pt in so far as the absolute no no zone for it's use is when there is both Oxygen and Chlorine being produced in the cell (see Pt Anode section). This occurs when Chloride is at a low concentration and Chlorate is present (cell getting close to a point where Perchlorate may start to form). There was little visible sign that the Anode had passivated but passivated it had. There were no insulating deposits or such like built up on it.<br>
 There was Perchlorate present in this cell when the liquor was tested with Methylene blue.
