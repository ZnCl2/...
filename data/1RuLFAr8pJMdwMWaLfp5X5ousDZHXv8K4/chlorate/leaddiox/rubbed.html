<h2>Some observations on  'rubbed on '  lead dioxide</h2>

Regarding what happens to the mixture of PbO2 and water that can be pasted onto something
to make it conductive I have found the following.<p>
The pasted PbO2 does not turn into 'plated type' PbO2 above the plating solution level (if all of anode is not put into tank to plate all of it at once).
 When you put a part of the pasted ceramic into the plating bath the
solution travels up the paste and the paste changes colour and almost has the appearance
of having a very thin plating of PbO2 on it surface, it is very thin if it is there at
all.<br>
The pasted PbO2 below the solution level dissapears and gets incorporated into,
converts/become part of the plating proper. There was no powder layer between the plated
on PbO2 and the original ceramic when plating is finished and the
plate will adhere to the ceramic.<br>
