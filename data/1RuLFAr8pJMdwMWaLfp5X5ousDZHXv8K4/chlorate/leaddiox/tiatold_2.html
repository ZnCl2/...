<h2> Titanium substrate Lead Dioxide Anode with ATO interface layer (II)</h2></center>
<hr size=20  color=grey>
This Anode was not completed properly as the Lead Nitrate plating system malfunctioned and the plating had to be stopped when only a very small depth of LD was plated (approx. 0.4mm).<br>

A piece of Grade one Titanium was shaped and drilled as per the pictures. The Ti measured approx. 14cm long (12.5cm active), by 1.85cm wide by 2.5mm thick. It was etched in 20% HCl for a few hours and seven coats of ATO were applied. The ATO precursor solution was obtained by reacting Tin metal + Antimony metal (solder) with HCl as described elsewhere on this page (Tin Oxide Anode section, at the link "This link describes a successful procedure for using SnCl2:2H2O to obtain a conductive Tin Oxide coat on Titanium").
The Ti substrate was kept in an 'upside down' position (or at least horizontal) so that the part of the Ti that was to receive the ATO coating was not contaminated with run off from the top of the Anode that was being handled. The Ti was not washed with water when it came out of the etch pot. It was lightly dried of adhering acid with a heat gun and then 'washed' with precursor solution by holding the Ti in an 'upside down' position and running excess ATO precursor solution onto the Ti surface using a plastic pipette. About 6ml of solution was used. The Ti was then dried and two more coats of ATO precursor solution applied using a small polyester cloth brush. The Ti was then baked for 8 minutes at 480&deg;C. The Ti then received a further 6 bakes with three coats per bake. The last bake was performed for 30 minutes.<br>
The ATO coated Titanium is shown in the picture. Total active surface area was approx. 52cm squared. <IMG SRC="all_coats.jpg" align=left border=5 vspace=8 hspace=18 alt="[ATO on Ti]"> A second piece of Ti was given a similar ATO coating in parallel and tested in a Chlorate cell to check that the ATO coating was OK. <br><p>
A coating of Alpha Lead Dioxide was now applied by using a Lead Tartrate bath. The Lead Tartrate bath was made up from:<br>
<ul><li>50 grams Potassium Sodium Tartrate </li>
<li>25 grams Sodium Hydroxide</li>
<li>48 grams Lead Oxide (Litharge)</li><br>
Dissolved in the order  listed into 1 liter of  water. The bath was heated to 60C to dissolve all Litharge. Any Litharge that did not dissolve was left in the bottom of the bath The Litharge was NOT ground with a pestle and mortar to get rid of the lumps  before adding to bath. This way a mistake IMO as quite a lot of PbO did not dissolve (approx. 15 grams). Perhaps grinding might have helped, not too sure.<br>
The actual bath size used way 1 litre.
The bath was used at 70C with a current density on the Anode of 1.2mA per square cm.  Stirring was not used and this may have been a mistake, not too sure.  The tank had to be topped up with water on a regular basis as the level dropped due to evaporation. Ti cathodes (two) were used. The ATO coated Ti was plated for 24 hours. <br>
An extremely bad coating of Alpha Lead Dioxide was obtained as shown in the picture. The Alpha seems to have only nucleated in places on the Anode surface for some reason or other. The Alpha that did plate adhered well to the Ti.

I decided to go ahead and plate with Beta LD from a Lead Nitrate bath. A standard Lead Nitrate bath was made up of approx. 400 grams per liter Lead Nitrate + some Copper Nitrate in deionized water. The bath was 70&deg;C and stirring was used. A two tank system was used, one tank was kept neutral by adding Lead Carbonate while the plating tank was at a pH of approx. 1. Each tank was 1 liter. There was a filter between each tank to stop solid Carbonate coming into the plating tank. A peristaltic pump on a timer was set up to  pump solution from the plating tank to the neutral tank and a glass siphon tube was used to return the neutral solution to the plating tank.  (Very small bubbles in the liquid kept accumulating in the siphon tube and after approx. 0.75 hours stopped the tube from working, requiring it to be filled with liquid again (baby siting job!). The system was shut down after approx. 3 hours.) 
Plating was performed at 20mA per square cm and stirring was used. No perspex beads were added to the plating tank. <br>
A good coating of Beta Lead Dioxide seemed to be forming on all parts of the Anode surface as shown in the picture. Approx. 0.3mm? coating was applied.<br>

The plating tank was tested for Nitrites, after approx. one hour of plating, using an aquarium kit. It showed positive. 3ml of 16% Hydrogen Peroxide was added to the tank and there was an immediate reaction which caused a mass of very small (Oxygen?) bubbles to form. It appears that you cannot add H Peroxide to the tank as it causes the Nitric acid to react with and dissolve! the Lead Dioxide. When the H2O2 was placed into the neutral tank it caused quite a lot of bubble too for some reason or other.  I may try Red Lead next time. When a little piece of LD + some plating solution is place into a test tube and a drop of H Peroxide added bubbles immediately start to stream from the LD.<BR>

A strap of Grade one Ti was attached to the Anode using a Grade 5 Titanium screw (6Al4V alloy) and the Anode placed into a Perchlorate cell which consisted of approx. 600 grams per liter Sodium Perchlorate + 58 grams per liter Sodium Chlorate. The task really is just to lower the Chlorate down to a level where the residual Chlorate can be eliminated using chemicals. The joint where the Anode was joined to the Ti strap was deliberately put below the solution level so as to see would this type of non welded joint perform OK. A similar idea was expressed on AmateurPyro by 'pdfbq' using a Pt Anode and Ti strap and some homemade Ti rivets. This type of joint seems to work perfectly. The Grade 5 screw corroded after a few days and was replaced with a homemade Grade one rivet with did not corrode. It would appear that Grade 5 is very inferior to Grade one in this type of application.

The Anode was operated in a Perchlorate cell for about 5 days and then stopped as all the LD was starting to fall off. The coating was of course far too thin.<p>
