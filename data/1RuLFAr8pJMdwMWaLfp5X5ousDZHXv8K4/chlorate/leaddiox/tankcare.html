<H2 align=center>Plating tank compound additions for the Lead Nitrate tank</H2>


The acid in the tank must be neutralized and the 
Lead ion concentration replenished by the addition of some of the 
following.<BR>Litharge (PbO) (mol weight: 223), somewhat hard to dissolve if not 
finely ground,<BR>Lead carbonate (PbCO3) (mol weight: 267), caused bubbles when 
added,<BR>Basic Lead carbonate ((PbCO3)2:Pb(OH)2)) (mol weight: 775), causes 
bubbles when added.<BR> 
<P>Litharge can be purchased at the ceramics store. Basic 
Lead Carbonate is called White Lead and is used in paints 
for boats. Lead hydroxide can be made from Lead Nitrate and Sodium hydroxide. 
<BR>80 grams NaOH dissolved in water is added to 332 grams Lead Nitrate 
dissolved in water and a white ppt immediately form's. This is lead Hydroxide 
and it should be washed a number of times before it is added to the tank.<BR><br>
The 
amount of compound to add to the tank depends on the amount of Lead Dioxide that 
was deposited on the anode that was plated.  The amount of compound to add to the tank depends on what 
particular compound you are using and is thus:<BR>

<P>If the tank becomes neutral before all of the amount of compound is added 
simply stop adding. Add some Nitric to put the pH low.  
<P>The following is some observations regarding the addition of compounds to 
tank.<BR>Lead carbonate PbCO3 (lab grade and dry from container) dissolves 
easily with some bubbles, more bubbles and foaming if using surfactant.<BR>Basic 
lead carbonate (PbCO3)2:Pb(OH)2 (lab grade and dry from container) won't 
dissolve easily and will float on top of the liquid and if the spoonful is large 
enough to overcome the surface tension of the plating bath it will sink as a 
fluffy lump and remain on the bottom where it will dissolve slowly with the 
occasional big bubble of CO2 emitted. If using surfactant in the bath the basic 
Lead Carbonate will 'wet' much easier and dissolve easily and cause a large 
amount or rising foam which can be difficult to keep in the tank. The only way 
to make this compound dissolve satisfactorily in a bath that has no surfactant is 
to make a slurry of the compound before adding to cell. This is done by putting 
some water and the basic Lead Carbonate into a (coffee) jar and shaking 
vigorously until the powder wets. This slurry will dissolve instantaneously 
without too much foaming. Add small amounts at a time.<BR>Lead Hydroxide 
dissolves easily and creates no bubbles.<BR>Lead Oxide (PbO) Litharge. This 
will dissolve easily if the particle size is small. If the Litharge is put into 
a container and stirred, the particles that remain in suspension will dissolve 
easily (because they are small). The larger particles will remain on bottom of 
bath container for a time, this is no harm.<BR>PbO is a good cheap neutralizer 
and it can be added to tank so that there is always some of it on the bottom of 
the tank where it can be stirred up now and again.

<P>Ions that are bad news in a plating tank, according to the literature, 
are:<BR>Chloride, Cobalt, selenium, arsenic and Iron. The only ion that is likely to 
effect you is Iron. If you are using 'crocodile' clamps made of steel to make 
connections to an anode that is being plated, you must be careful that no 
corrosion (it is very likely to form on the damp clamp) falls or gets into tank. 
Better not to use Iron at all. Not too sure about SS but it has been in a 
plating tank and had no corrosion or ill effects reported. Keep Gouging rods out of 
the tank as them may contain Iron particles.
<P>Nitrites are formed at the cathode as a side reaction and can build up 
in the tank. The addition of Hydrogen Peroxide to the tank has been used to 
counteract this problem. The build up of Nitrites lowers 
current efficiency and will give bad coats of Lead Dioxide. Resting the tank for 
a day or two after it has been neutralized will allow Nitrites to convert back 
to Nitrates and allow the tank to plate at its best. Bubbling air through the tank will  speed up the process. Careful of splashes/spray.<BR>
