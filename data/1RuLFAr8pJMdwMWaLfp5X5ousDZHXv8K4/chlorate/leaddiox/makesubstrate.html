<h2> Making, casting and fireing your own substrate</h2>

By mixing your own clay you will have control over the
porosity and, to some extent, the firing
temperature.<br>

A good starting point would be:<p>

Kaolin...............52% <br> 
Potters flint........35% (Sourse of Alumina)<br>  
Feldspar (potash)....13% <br><p>

Matures at cone 10.<p>

This would be fine for slip casting but not
plastic enough for other forming methods. In order
to improve the plasticity you can replace up to a
third of the kaolin with a good ball clay.
Replacing some or all of the flint with calcined
alumina will result in a stronger product (up to
300% improvement in fired strenth!). The amount of
feldspar determines how much glass is formed on
firing, more feldspar means more glass and lower
porosity. Too little feldspar will result in a
weak product (unless fired VERY high). You can
also try replacing the feldspar with the same
amount of nepheline syenite, this will not only
cause the body to mature at cone 8 but it also
acts as a source of alumina to some extent. You
should have no trouble in locating these
materials from the ceramics supply store.<p>
Example<p>
The substrate was made by slip-casting the
following mixture in a plaster mould:

Alumina (calcined): 33.5% (alumina)
G200 feldspar:      13.5%
EPK kaolin:         53.0%

To above mixture water was added to the amount of
25% of the total. The slip was deflocculated by
adding about 1% of Darvan #7. After casting/drying
it was fired to about 1300 degrees Celsius to give
a very hard, strong, paper white, slightly porous
ceramic body. <p>

See <a href="http://www.digitalfire.com/magic/toc.htm" > Magic of Fire </a> for more information on 
ceramic working  and materials.<p> 
It would be highly advantageous to sand blast the finished product.<p><P>
Another type of substrate that may be suitable can be fabricated using abrasive grit and polyester resin (available from car accessory shop).<br> 
Al2O2 (aluminium oxide) or silicon carbide (carborundum) is suitable and the grit size should be from about 30 to 80. Using mesh size 60 you should mix 1 part (weight) resin to 3.6 parts grit (60)
and mix well. If a grit size is not 60 you may have to add more or less resin. Then add the hardiner. This mixture should be placed into a mould that will give the finsihed product a rough surface. A mold can be made from potters clay (no need to fire, only dry it) or a sand mold. A plastic pipe will not make a suitable mold. <p>
