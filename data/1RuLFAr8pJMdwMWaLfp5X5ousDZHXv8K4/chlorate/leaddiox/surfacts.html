<h2> Surfactants</h2>

What is a surfactant?<br>
They can be divided into a number of groups.<br> Anionic surfactants have a hydrophobic tail and an anionic head, such as dodecylbenzenesulfonate.<br>
Cationic surfactants have a hydrophobic tail and a cationic head, such as cetlypyridinium.<br>
Nonionic surfactants have a hydrophobic tail and an uncharged but hydrophilic head, such as poly(propylene oxide)/poly(ethylen oxide) biblock polymers (Pluionic)  <br>


I found this on the net:<p>

There are four main classes of detergents: anionic, cationic(both ionic), non-ionic and amphoteric.<br>

1)Anionic Detergents<br>

Anionic means a negatively charged molecule. The detergency of the anionic
detergent is vested in the anion. The anion is neutralised with an alkaline
or basic material, to produce full detergency. Anionic surfactants are a type of ionic surfactant.
<br>

2)Cationic Detergents<br>

Cation means positively charged. The detergency is in the cation, which can
be a substantially sized molecule. The cationic detergents invariably
contain amino compounds. The most widely used would be the quaternary ammonium
salts, such as cetyl trimethylammonium chloride(bromide), a well known
germicide.<br>

3)Nonionic Detergents<br>

The vast majority of all nonionic detergents are condensation products or
ethylene oxide with a hydrophobe. They would be the single biggest group of
all detergents. <br>

4)Amphoterics<br>

These have the characteristics of both anionic detergents and cationic
fabric softeners. They tend to work best at neutral pH, and are found in
shampoo’s, skin cleaners and carpet shampoo. They are very stable in strong
acidic conditions and have found favour for use with hydrofluoric acid.<p>

SO THERE you have it<br>
SIGMA have a lovely catalogue on surfactants.<p>

The surfactants that have been proposed for adding to lead dioxide plating tanks have been both cationic and nonionic. <p> 
Cetyltrimethlyammonium bromide (also called Hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) is a cationic surfactant that is claimed to reduce stress in lead dioxide in JES Sept. 1976 p1294 (available on this page).<br>If using this surfactant it is desirable to mix it with a small amount of water before adding to plating tank, as it is inclined to form clumps that are tedious to dissolve.
Use about 3 grams per liter.<br> 
US PATENT No. 2,945,791 and JES Feb. 1958 (on this page)  recommends a surfactant of the 'alkyl phenoxy  polyoxyethelene ethanol class' . It has a trade name "Ipegal CO-880 (was made by Antara Chemical Division of General Dyestuff  Corp.) and is a nonionic surfactant. Use one or two grams per liter.<p>
A surfactant similar to the Ipegal is Synperonic NP-30 from ICI and
also Tergitol NP-9.5 from Union Carbide.
