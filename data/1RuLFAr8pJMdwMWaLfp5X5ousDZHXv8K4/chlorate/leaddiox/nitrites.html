<h3>Nitrites</h3>


Nitrites are formed at the Cathode as a side reaction and can build up 
in the tank. <br>

NO<small>3</small><sup>-</sup>  +  2e  +  2H<sup>+</sup> ===>   NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O<br>
<font size=-1>One mole Nitrate + two moles acid + 2 moles electrons ===> One mole Nitrite + 1 mole of water<p></font>
Then the  reaction below starts to occur at the Anode.<br>
NO<small>2</small><sup>-</sup>  +  H<small>2</small>O  -  2e  <sup>-</sup>   ===>  NO<small>3</small><sup>- </sup> +  2H<sup>+</sup><BR>
<font size=-1>One mole Nitrite + one mole water - 2 moles electrons ===> One mole Nitrate + 2 moles acid<p></font>


Since the potential required for the above process (0.80V) is far lower than that
required for the formation of PbO2 (1.46V) , current efficiency will drop as the unwanted reaction if favoured.
The addition of Hydrogen Peroxide to the tank has been used to 
counteract this problem by Oxidizing Nitrites back to Nitrates. The build up of Nitrites lowers 
current efficiency and will give bad coats of Lead Dioxide. Resting the tank for 
a day or two after it has been neutralized will allow Nitrites to convert back 
to Nitrates and allow the tank to plate at its best. Bubbling air through the tank will  speed up the process. Careful of splashes/spray.<br>
In US Pat. 2994649 it is stated that a 'Sodium Nitrite' (!) increase of 0.1% will reduce plating CE to 30%.  Hydrogen Peroxide (35%) was added slowly over a half hour period to the 1364 litre tank to eliminate Nitrite.  Note that they are not making an Anode in this patent and the current density is very high on the SS that is being plated. The PbO2 is being manufactured as a reagent.<br>
Another paper available <a href="nitrites.pdf">here</a> gives information on Nitrites reducing plating CE. This paper encourages low current density on the Cathodes to reduce Nitrite formation. Hydrogen Peroxide and Pb3O4 are used to counteract the Nitrite problem.  Note that this paper is concerned with making plates for batteries.<br>
Another paper (Lead Dioxide Coatings, Chem. Soc. Rev.  40, 3879–3894 (year 2011)) states that the presence of Copper Nitrate in the plating tank suppresses Nitrite formation. I have never heard this mentioned before in any other paper. From experience of making some LD Anodes using a two tank plating system it would appear that Nitrites are not a problem when a few grams of Pb3O4 (Minum) is added to the neutralizer tank.<br>
Nitrite testing kits are available for aquarium's and may be useful for detecting Nitrites in the tank. <br>
<br>
You cannot use Hydrogen Peroxide to destroy Nitrites while there is Lead Dioxide in the tank. The H2O2 will facilitate the Nitric acid to attack the PbO2 whereby it starts to dissolve and form a mass of bubbles in the tank. LD is also a catalyst for the decomposition of Hydrogen Peroxide.
From some Anode runs it appears that using Red Lead (Pb304) gets rid of Nitrites.<p>
