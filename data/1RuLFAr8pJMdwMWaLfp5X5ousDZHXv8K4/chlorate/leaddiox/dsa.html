 The MMO (Formally known under the trade name of  DSA, Dimensionally Stable Anode) was invented by Henry Beer.
 The term is generally used to describe any Anode having a Valve metal substrate coated with Oxides of Noble metals. Ruthenium Oxide on Ti is by far the most usual type and is used for Chlorate synthesis. The Noble metal Oxides alloy with the  Valve metal Oxide, usually Titanium Oxide and the coating is conductive. They are the Anode of choice for all Chlorate manufacture nowadays. The other type of MMO usually encountered is used for corrosion control and it contains the Ir Oxide/Ta Oxide mix. The more common types of MMO will not make Perchlorate but if Pt (or Pt + Pd) Oxide is present in the coating they will make Perchlorate as stated in US 4267025. This type of MMO is not available for purchase AFAIK.<br> 

There are a large amount of combinations of Oxides, processes and substrates. The original MMO (DSA) was a Ti substrate with   a Ru Oxide coating. 	The Ru Oxide alloyed with the Ti Oxide giving a new Anode surface material. They can be made by thermal decomposition of compounds that have been applied to the substrate. There are a large number of patents on the subject. The new Anodes had the advantage of lasting a long time, the Anode/Cathode spacing did not require adjustment (Dimensionally Stable) and they had a low over-potential for Chlorine evolution in salt solution which meant that cells now ran at a lower Voltage giving large power savings. They also work at much larger current densities than Graphite which means cells are more compact.<br><p>

MMO Anodes are available to purchase from corrosion control companies, pool chlorination companies, sewage treatment companies and others. They have impressive life spans when used properly. Corrosion control Anodes have lifttimes of years at current densities that are lower (in Brackish water) that what you would use at in a Chlorate cell. The coatings on corrosion control Anodes will be geared toward corrosion control (Oxygen Evolution) as opposed to Chlorate making but it would be fair to assume that they will have long lifetimes in the Chlorate cell and will make Chlorate efficiently. In fact the higher the salt concentration the longer the life. The MMO is cheap if you can purchase in small amounts. Minimum orders may apply. There is a good article at the bottom of this page from Platinum Metals Reviews if the reader is interested in the development of the MMO Anode.<br>

Pool Chlorination devices are often dumped when in fact the actual Anodes and Cathodes of the device are OK. They may have salted up or perhaps the power supply failed. They can be had from company's supplying Chlorinators as scrap. An example from XENOID is shown below. <p>

It is difficult to find as much info on MMO as on the other Anodes regarding current densities and temperatures used in Chlorate cell.<br>
Current density used in Chlorate cells are in the region of 300mA/square cm. Temperature in industry (pH controlled cells), is in the region
of 70&deg;C to 80&deg;C.  There is a Thesis in the further reading section regarding MMO in modern Chlorate cells.<br>
MMO is very rugged when used properly and can last 10 years in commercial plant. It can be used at high temperatures which favour Chemical Chlorate formation (in pH controlled cells). They can also be used to take
the Chloride level low (50g/l) without undue damage to the Anode. This is  an advantage if trying to take solid Sodium Chlorate out of solution. It is probably better to keep above 100g/l Chloride if you are trying to maximize Anode lifetime.
<br>
 The anti corrosion Anodes (Ir + Ta Oxide) are designed for use in very low Chloride situations. It may be OK to use them in Chlorate cells with low Chloride content without undue erosion but CE will obviously suffer. Remember that they are used at very low current densities when being used as corrosion control Anodes in very low salt concentration mediums.<p>
When the Anode in installed in the cell it should be surrounded sensibly with Cathode(s) so that the current is evenly distributed on the Anode. If you place just one Cathode in the cell this will give a greater current density on the side close to the Cathode which may have implications for Anode erosion if you are running the Anode at high current densities. Some wire type Anodes have a Copper core for carrying current. This can be sealed by drilling out the bottom half inch of Copper and filling with sealer.<br>
See <a href="mmo_low.html">here</a> for  a study of an MMO Anode in a Chlorate cell that was run all the way to very low Chloride concentration.<br> 
<p>
<A href="mmopics.html">Wire MMO (Anit corrosion Anode) installed in cell</A><p>
The wire Anode (above link) was used in a cell in an attempt to make Perchlorate. Current density on Anode
was 120mA/cm squared in a 0.5 liter cell containing 250grams Na Chlorate. 2 grams NaF where added to cell. 
Chlorate was twice recrystallized to give a low Chloride concentration. The cell was run
for approx. 25 days at one Amp. No Perchlorate formed. The (small) Chloride concentration (as guesstimated with a visual Silver Nitrate test) did not seem to diminish.<br>When the Anode was examined after the run it was
noticed that the black coating on the Anode had been removed in places and where it was not removed it could
be simply rubbed off with a cloth. There was still an active coating on the Anode though as it continued to 
emit gas when put into a Chlorate cell. There was no noticeable rise in cell voltage.<p>
<br><p>
There are a large amount of reports of MMO Anodes that stop functioning after a relatively short time in cells. It is believed this is caused by impurities in the cell liquor. There is a very good discussion regarding impurities in Chlorate cells to be found in <A href="mmo_poison.pdf">Effects of Electrolyte Impurities in
Chlorate Cells</A>. <br><b> Keep cell liquor as free as possible from impurities. </b>
<br>

According to <A href="http://www.corrpro.com/corrproProductDetails.asp?cProduct=98&amp;cType=11">www.corrpro.com</A> MMO should not be used in electrolytes containing Barium or Cadmium.<br>
According to Encyclopedia of Chemical Processing and Design, Vol 51, 1995 page 146, Barium is  a poison to Noble Metal or Noble Metal Oxide Anodes and may even reduce there lifetimes.<br>
According to US Patent 7,250,144 (July 2007)  Fluorine additive can damage Chlorate Anodes (MMO, since it is a modern patent).<p>
There are a huge variety of Patents for MMO (DSA) Anodes using TiO2 + Nobel metal Oxides. Nobel metal Oxides can be obtained from some photographic supply stores, eg. http://www.artcraftchemicals.com <p>
US Patent 4267025 depicts an MMO Anode made from Ti, Platinum Group Oxides + Tin Oxide that is suitable for Perchlorate production.<p>
