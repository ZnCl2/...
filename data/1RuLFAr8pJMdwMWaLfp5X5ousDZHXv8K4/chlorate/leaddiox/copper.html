<h2 align=center> Electroplating metal connections</h2>
<BR>People have suggested that you cannot 
electro deposit silver directly onto Lead Dioxide and that it must be sprayed on 
or painted on.<BR>You may be able to use an "electroless" silver plating tank to 
plate silver onto the PbO<SMALL>2</SMALL>. This is a plating tank that does not 
use plating current to but the silver onto the object to be plated. The silver 
deposits onto the object of its own accord. It is not the same as silvering 
mirrors, where a similar thing happens. The silver baths that are used for 
silvering mirrors will only put on a very thin deposit of silver and then will 
STOP plating. The true electroless plating tanks will go on depositing silver 
and build up a layer of silver of the required thickness that you want. Be very 
careful with silver electroless plating baths. If they are left lying around 
after the plating job is complete, very explosive compounds can form and will 
cause an explosion as soon as you touch the container. The following electroless 
silver plating baths are taken from US Patent No. 3,318,794. See 
http://ie.espacenet.com/ for the patent.<BR>In the patent they discuss silvering 
the inside of a hollow cylindrical powdered Lead Dioxide/plastic polymer anode 
with silver using the following process:<BR>Solution A: <BR>15 g. silver nitrate 
in 1500 ml solution with enough ammonia so that the final pH is 10.
<P>Solution B:<BR>1 gram silver nitrate and 0.83 grams Rochelle salt in 500 ml 
water, boiled for 20 minutes and filtered
<P>The anode cavity is washed with 5% NaOH and then filled with 460 ml A and 90 
ml B
<P>Electrolysis is carried out with a silver electrode hanging in the center 
(recall that this is plating the inside of a hollow PbO2 cylinder). The silver 
is plated on the Lead Dioxide until the process ceases, then a new solution is 
prepared and used to plated, etc. several times until a decent layer is 
deposited.<BR>After this, copper is plated over the silver using with a bath 
made of 200g/L CuSO4 and 50g/L H2SO4.<BR>
<P>
<H3>Plating copper</H3>Copper sulfate/sulfuric acid is the preferred copper 
plating bath in the electronics industry. Copper concentration in the 12-18 g/L 
range, sulfuric acid in the 200-250 g/L range and chloride in the 30-60 ppm 
range. Levelling/carrier agent such as 2,000 polyethylene glycol and brightening 
agent such as an alkyl sulfonate both in the ppb/ppm range are essential for 
macro and micro level grain refining to enhance the hardness and tensile 
strength of the deposit. Without these additives the deposit will be matt in 
appearance and have both lower ductility and be more susceptible to cracking 
under thermal stress.<BR>The proper control of these components is most easily 
determined using a Hull cell which allows you to visually compare the appearance 
of the deposit over a range of current densities. This is accomplished by 
angling the cathode at 45 degrees WRT the anode in a small plating cell (I can't 
recall the dimensions off the top off my head). These later two components are 
typically proprietary in nature and sold by electroplating chemical specialists 
such as Lea Ronal/Shipley, MacDermid Chemical, Atotech USA.<BR>The cathode is 
the piece that is being plated the anode in this case would be a copper bar or 
basket with copper balls or chips.<BR>The bath must be aerated at the cathode to 
prevent burning (soft powdery copper deposition). The cathodic current density 
is typically in the 12 to 18 ASF (13 to 19mA/cm^2) range for the Cu/H2SO4 ratio 
outlined above.<BR>Regarding the chloride...it's use pertains to a copper 
sulfate plating bath. The purpose is to aid in uniform dissolution of the copper 
anode as the cupric ions are deposited onto the piece your plating. Chloride 
becomes a component of the black film that forms on the anode (along with the 
organic additives). The film forms as the copper in the anode dissolves to 
replace the cupric ions as the plate onto the cathode (your product). It is 
usually added in the form of HCl but NaCl works as well.

<H3>Purifying sterling silver</H3>Dissolve your sterling silver in nitric acid; 
a bit of heat will help if your acid is dilute. Next, precipitate the silver as 
the chloride, AgCl, by adding an excess of NaCl solution. Wash your precipitate 
and then reduce it to metallic silver by one of the following methods:
<P>1) Add an excess of NaOH solution and heat to boiling/ nearly boiling. Add 
either glucose (dextrose) or formaldehyde solution, a little at a time, until 
all the AgCl is reduced to metallic silver. (The resultant silver powder is 
grey. not shiny) This method only takes less than an hour.
<P>2)Add some pieces of zinc to your AgCl under water. The zinc will slowly 
reduce the AgCl to silver metal. The excess zinc can be dissolved in HCl. This 
method takes a few days.
<P>3) Dry your silver chloride and intimately mix it with an excess of Na2CO3 
(soda ash). Heat this mixture with a propane torch (this is normally done on a 
block of charcoal) until the silver melts to form a button of pure silver.
<P>I prefer the first method as I have used it on several occasions in the past. 
I have never tried this, but you might be able to make your own conductive epoxy 
by adding the silver powder obtained in methods (1) or (2) to some normal (not 5 
minute!) epoxy. The idea is to use the epoxy to bond some copper strip to the 
electrode. This will only require a small amount of epoxy. It might also work if 
you add graphite powder rather than silver although I expect the resistance to 
be higher.
