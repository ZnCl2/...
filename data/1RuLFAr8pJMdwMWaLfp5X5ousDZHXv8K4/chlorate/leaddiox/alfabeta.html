<BODY>

<H2 align=center>Lead Dioxide</H2>Lead Dioxide has two crystal structures, 
(polymorphic), Alpha and Beta. The Beta structure is the structure best able to  
stand up to the (Per)Chlorate cell conditions and it is what is mainly 
electro deposited from the acidic Lead Nitrate bath when current densitys of less than 40mA per square cm is used for deposition.<br> 
The Alpha structure is not good at standing up to the (Per)Chlorate cell 
electrolyte. The Alpha form has better adhesion properties and can be used to give a more uniform, smoother coating of LD. 
The Alpha structure is electro deposited from alkaline baths and is 
used in US PATENT No. 4,064,035 where it is electro deposited alternatively with 
Beta to eliminate stress in the Lead Dioxide. The Alpha form has no internal stress, unlike the Beta form.
The Alpha can also be deposited from an acid Lead Nitrate bath when a high (70mA per square cm) current density is used, according to RPW.<BR>
The diagram shows the structure of Alpha and 
Beta Lead Dioxide.

<P>Lead Dioxide is highly conductive and is more conductive than most metals. 
This is because of the deficiency of Oxygen atoms in its crystal lattice which 
leave charged carriers available in the crystal lattice. <BR>Lead Dioxide is not 
stoichiometric. It formula could more accurately be described as PbO<FONT 
size=1>1.98<FONT size=3><BR>
<P>The Alpha Lead Dioxide is slightly more conductive that the Beta,the 
resistivity of Alpha being 10^<SUP>-3</SUP> and Beta being 4 * 10<SUP>-3

electro deposited Lead Dioxide. Most of the Lead Dioxide deposited from the Lead 
Nitrate bath is Beta Lead Dioxide. <BR>
