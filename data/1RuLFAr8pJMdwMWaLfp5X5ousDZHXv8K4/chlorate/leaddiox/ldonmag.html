<BODY><H1>The Magnetite substrate Lead Dioxide anode, MSLDA</H1>
It appears that when a solid piece of Lead Dioxide is simply attached to a piece of
Magnetite and placed into a (Per)Chlorate cell it will function as a successful anode.<P>

There is no reaction 
between the Lead Dioxide and the Magnetite.<BR> The Magnetite is very resistant to (Per)Chlorate cell conditions
and does not erode by any significant  amount.<BR>
 The current entering the anode goes into the electrolyte via
both the Magnetite and the Lead Dioxide. In a Chlorate cell the  Magnetite may take part in the making of 
product along with the Lead Dioxide. In a Perchlorate cell only the Lead Dioxide is involved in making
product as Magnetite will not make Perchlorate. The  current leaving the anode via the Magnetite is 
obviously wasted but this is of no great consequence. The anode can be used to go from Chloride to Perchlorate
in a single run of the cell.<br>

The anode has been briefly tested in both a Perchlorate cell (Chlorate to Perchlorate), and in a cell
which was run from Chloride all the way to Perchlorate (low Chlorate concentration at end of run). There is little anode contamination of the electrolyte.
If too low of a Current density is used on the anode when in the Perchlorate cell no Perchlorate will form.<br>
With the first test of the anode in the Perchlorate cell,  a current of 1 amps would not make Perchlorate.
 A current of 4.1 amps made Perchlorate in abundance.<br>
A one mole (54 grams NaCl) cell was run for 4 days. The 100% current efficiency for conversion of the Chloride to 
Chlorate is approx. two days. After two days  the cell was tested for Perchlorate. Perchlorate
 had formed. (It may have formed sooner as the cell was not tested). It would seem the cell is working
at 100% current efficiency.??  Since the cell is small (150ml), the current is 4.1 amps, and the current density on the Lead Dioxide (ignoring Magnetite) may be up to 400mA per CM squared, Perchlorate may have
started to form before Chloride level dropped to approx. 10%??. (10% Chloride is roughly the level 
of Chloride that Perchlorate begins to form at in a more typical cell). I am not too sure why 
Perchlorate formed so early. The cell is sitting in a  container of water to keep it cool.<p>
 This anode looks like a rugged, reproducible anode for the amateur (Per)Chlorate maker.<p><br>
 Magnetite can also be plated with Lead Dioxide. One single attempt at plating Magnetite from a
 Lead Nitrate bath was made. A very light coating of LD was successfully applied to the Magnetite 
 and the anode worked OK in a Chlorate cell.<br>
 A  heavier coating with testing is required.<p>
