Potassium Chlorate is not hygroscopic 
and has no known hydrates.<BR>
Potassium Chlorate can be made similarly  to Sodium 
Chlorate. Since Potassium Chlorate is much less soluble than Na Chlorate the K 
Chlorate will crystallise out of the cell electrolyte as you run the cell.  If you 
are using carbons as Anodes the Graphite will be difficult to separate out of 
the solid product and you will have to re-dissolve it in order to filter out the 
Graphite. Using pH control will greatly help here as there will be little Graphite sludge to filter out. 
 If using Lead Dioxide there will be a small amount of brown Lead 
Dioxide on the bottom of the cell with the solid Chlorate and if you wish to 
remove it you will have to re dissolve the Chlorate and filter. This will take 
a lot of water as the K Chlorate is not very soluble and if you try to use very hot 
water you will get the K Chlorate crystallising out in the filter.
 <BR>Potassium 
Chlorate is by far the most popular Chlorate for the Amateur to make as it is dangerous to use Sodium Chlorate for Pyro stuff.
 If you keep your cell clean, use a MMO (DSA), or Pt Anodes and a non corroding 
Cathode (proper type of SS or Ti) you will be able to harvest almost pure K 
Chlorate from your cell at regular intervals. It should be given  a wash 
using cold water to get rid of any KCl that is clinging to it.  Washings should be returned to the cell so that nothing is wasted.

<BR><p>KCl 
can be obtained as a fertilizer, it is called Muriate of Potash. It may have 
49% K written on the bag. (100% pure KCl will have 52.44% K). In the USA where the %K is stated is a different way (as %K<SMALL>2</SMALL>O !) there may be 60% K<SMALL>2</SMALL>O written on the bag. 60% K<SMALL>2</SMALL>O = 49.8% K = 95% KCl (by weight). You may wish to purify the fertilizer grade by recrystilizion.

<BR>	Another possible source of KCl 
is with the people who sell equipment for softening water. Sodium Chloride is 
usually used in the devices but some people object to having any Sodium ion 
in their drinking water so they need to use Potassium Chloride. This KCl will be  pure.<br>
'Lo-Salt' or 'Lite-Salt are products containing both NaCl and KCl. These salts can be seperated but this is lots in work for the Amateur. You will be better seperation at the Chlorate stage where solubilities are alot different. If you want to seperate NaCl and KCl you can start  <A href="sep_na_k.html">here</A>.
<P>
<H4>Run time</H4>You should start off your K cell with about 340g of K Chloride (approx.)
per litre of water (saturated solution). When running 
the cell you may add water or KCl solution to top it up if evaporation allows. A similar modification, 
as per the Na cell, should be made to the run time of the K cell if you are 
using KCl solution to top up the cell. <BR>The run time for a K Chlorate cell 
can be calculated by simply dividing the figure's in the table (in the run time 
section for Na Chlorate) by 1.27 and using the resulting figure as per usual in 
the formula, or use the program. 
<P>At the end of the run you will have a ppt of Chlorate on the bottom of the 
cell.<BR>Remove the Chlorate, and add 0.61 grams KCl for every gram K Chlorate 
removed from cell and top up with water if necessary. You will now be back 
(approx.) to the conditions at the start of the run. The run time will be the 
same as it was the first time. You will probably have to recrystallize your crop 
of K Chlorate to clean it up from Lead Dioxide or Graphite. If using MMO (DSA) and a 
non corroding Cathode you can use after a single wash to remove Chloride.

<P>
<H3>Potassium Chlorate from Sodium Chlorate</H3>Potassium Chlorate can also be 
made by adding KCl solution to Sodium Chlorate solution (so called double 
decomposition). The Potassium Chlorate will ppt out as it is the least soluble 
of all the components in the solution.<BR>If you make Sodium Chlorate first and 
then make Potassium Chlorate by adding KCl, you can get rid of  Lead Dioxide 
powder  by letting the Sodium Chlorate cell settle for a day and then decanting 
off the Sodium Chlorate. This saves you the bother of filtering. You could 
probably get rid of the Graphite by the same method (if you are using a Graphite 
Anode) but you would have to let the cell settle for more than a day (give it a boil to get rid of dissolved gasses)  and the 
decanting would have to be done carefully. When the decanting is done you will 
have a clear liquid containing Sodium Chlorate + NaCl that can be used to make 
your K Chlorate.<BR>
<P>The amount of KCl to add to the Sodium Chlorate will depend on the amount of 
Sodium Chlorate that you have in solution. You need the same amount of moles of 
KCl as there are moles NaClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> if you want to get as much 
KClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> as possible. For every gram NaClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> you will 
need 74.5/106.5 = 0.699 grams KCl. It is difficult to know how much 
NaClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> you have in the solution if you have not started with 
solid NaClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> and dissolved it in the water. 
<P>The whole thing can be simplified if you are going to make more Na Chlorate 
in order to make more K Chlorate. If you simply estimate the amount of Sodium 
Chlorate in the solution and add the appropriate amount of KCl. You can do this 
when the solution is cold. Keep adding the KCl slowly with stirring until you 
are getting no more precipitation of KClO<SMALL>3</SMALL>. Then stop adding the 
KCl and filter out the KClO<SMALL>3</SMALL>. You can then start up the Sodium 
Chlorate cell again by using the solution that you filtered. There will now be 
enough Sodium Chloride in the cell for electrolysed to begin. There will be some 
K Chlorate dissolved in the cell but it will not matter. You will get it out the 
next time around. The run time will be similar to the first time around, or 
slightly shorter (5 - 10%).
