<H2 align=center>Run time for Sodium Perchlorate cell</H2>The current efficiency 
for a Perchlorate cell is not pH dependent as shown by scientific studies.  The electrolyte will drift 
alkaline. Efficiency increases as the current density on the Anode increases and 
decreases as the amount of Chlorate in the solution decreases. The current efficiency in industrial plants are  80%, 
and above.  Industrial plants always keep the Chlorate and Perchlorate levels high and separate out the Perchlorate in a crystallizer. The Amateur will (probably) be running 
the Perchlorate cell on a batch process and will therefor run the cell until there is little or no Chlorate
 left. This will give lower current efficiencies. <br> Since it only takes two moles (as opposed to 6 moles
 for Chloride to Chlorate) of electrons to make one mole of Perchlorate from one mole of 
Chlorate,  Perchlorate cells can have (pleasantly) surprising short run times.
<BR>In order to make one Chlorate molecule into one Perchlorate molecule you must move 
one Oxygen atom from water to the Chlorate. This takes two electrons. Another 
way of saying this, is that it takes two moles of electrons (26.8 Ah x 2) to 
make one mole of Perchlorate out of one mole of Chlorate.<BR>The overall 
reaction equation is: NaClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> + H<SMALL>2</SMALL>O + two electrons 
===&gt; NaClO<SMALL>4</SMALL> + H<SMALL>2</SMALL> gas<BR>
<P>The Chlorate concentration at which the current efficiency starts to decline 
is not a well defined point and varies form cell to cell. There are a lot of variables that effect 
the point at where the low Chlorate concentration effects current efficiency.  I 
have assumed that it is effected at about 100g/l Chlorate which is roughly where 
it happens in a fairly typical cell. The actual current efficiency that you will get for a particular Anode and cell set up 
will be difficult to predict in advance. Titrations for Chlorate can be very useful.

The table shows recommended run times for a Perchlorate cell running at an 
overall current efficiency of 50%<p>
<P align=center><IMG alt="[DIAGRAM OF TABLE CALCULATION]" hspace=10 
src="_img/calcperc.gif" vspace=10></P><br>
Another form of the above formula you can use is:<br><p>
<b>
Run time in hours = <big>(</big>5360 X Weight of Chlorate to convert<big>) / (</big>Molecular weight of Chlorate X Amps X %CE<big>)</big></b>
<br><p>



If using Chlorate solution to top up your cell you will of course need to factor this into your run times.
<BR> <BR>
The current 
efficiency will be about 80% when the Chlorate levels are above about 100g/l but 
as the Chlorate level drops below the 100g/l mark (as more and more Perchlorate 
is formed) the current efficiency drops and you get an overall current 
efficiency of 50% (or less) if you run your cell to the point where there is very little 
Chlorate left. <br>
This saves labour and you 
can take out nearly pure Perchlorate out of the cell by simply evaporating off 
all the water. You may wish to destroy the small amount of Chlorate left in the 
cell first by chemical means.
<BR>If you want to run your cell and stay in the 
high current efficiency region (&gt;100g/l Chlorate) then you can stop running 
your cell at the recommended time (assume you are getting approx. 80% CE)  and then attempt to take out a crop of Perchlorate.  Crystalizing out solid Sodium Perchlorate is not really possible for the Amateur to do
successfully and the only real practical method is to reduce the Chlorate to a low level, chemically 
destroy residual Chlorate  and evaporate all the water away. Titrate cell contents to see what Chlorate levels are at the end of the run.<BR>
<br>
Note that Platinum Anodes will erode if used to reduce the Chlorate concentration
to a low value. Keep a check  on Anode erosion.<br>
  Lead Dioxide is really needed (Pt will do it if erosion is ignored) if you wish to run a cell from Chloride to Chlorate to Perchlorate to low Chlorate concentration (this overall method is not to be recommended IMO), without stopping.  Platinum will erode if you use it to go from Chloride
  to Perchlorate. Erosion will be greatest during the time when Chlorate concentration is low and there is still Chloride in the cell  but it may still be worth taking an
erosion hit in your particular situation if you want to save labour. Pt plated Titanium Anodes can be ruined 
after a batch or two!<br><p>
If making Potassium Perchlorate from Potassium Chlorate, K Perchlorate will crystallize out of solution due it it's low solubility. Don't know much about %CE in K Perchlorate cells using K Chlorate as the starting material. It has been done by 'Swede'with OK %CE figures.<p><br>
From Swede: <br>If you know the  amount of dry (and anhydrous) solid product you have produced in grams from a run you can calculate the CE using the following simple formula:<br><p>
<table Border><tr><td>Process</td><td>Formula for CE in %</tr><tr><td></tr>
<tr><td>Na Chloride to Chlorate</td><td>151.08 * Weight/Ah</tr>
<tr><td>Na Chlorate to Perchlorate</td><td>43.78 * Weight/Ah</tr>
<tr><td>Na Chloride to Perchlorate</td><td>175.10 * Weight/Ah</tr></table><p>
There is a small spreadsheet <a href="na_perk_calc.zip">here</a> that is useful for calculating %CE from two successive Chlorate titrations of a Perchlorate cell.<p>

<table border=2 bordercolor=red><th colspan=2><center>Some useful Weights</center></th>
