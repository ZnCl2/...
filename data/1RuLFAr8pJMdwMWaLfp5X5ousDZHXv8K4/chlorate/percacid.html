<h2 align=center>Perchloric acid</h2>



Perchloric acid can be produced by electrolysis or by a ion exchange mechanism using a resin.<br>
See: Trans. Electrochem. Soc. 75, 271 - 78 (1939) for electrolysis method.<br> 
US Patent No. 2,392,861 describes the industrial production of Perchloric acid using NaClO<SMALL>4</SMALL> and HCl.<br>
Also US Patent No.  1271633  describes making Perchloric acid from HCl by electrolysis.<br>
There is a discussion regarding Perchloric acid manufacture at: http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=12&page=1     

<p>
The acid is extremely corrosive and is very damaging to tissue. It will form explosive mixtures with anything combustible and these mixtures may ignite or detonate without warning. The usual strength of the acid is 72%wt where it forms a constant boiling point azetope. The 70% acid is fairly stable, the anhydrous acid (100%) will explode of its own accord if stored for a period of time. It can only be stored indefinitely at liquid air temperatures.
<br><p>
From the Russian Journal article:
<pre>
Colourless perchloric acid, i.e. an acid containing
no lower oxides of chlorine, does not explode out 
of contact with reductants, and is therefore safe
  when handled carefully.</pre>
Beware if your acid has a yellow tint!<p>


<h3>Preparation</h3>

The following is from JACS  15 page 15 (1910)<br>
The Perchlorate must be free from Chlorate.<br>
A saturated solution of Sodium Perchlorate  was poured into two and one half times its volume of pure HCl (density 1.20). After thorough agitation the Sodium Chloride was allowed to settle, the the clear liquid was siphoned off, and the Sodium Chloride drained in a funnel by suction, and washed with a little more acid. The solution containing HCl and Perchloric acid, with a little salt of Na was evaporate until dense white fumes of Perchloric acid began to appear (203&deg;C). The liquid was found to be completely free from HCl. At this point the concentration of the Perchloric acid is approx. the density of the dihydrate, about 70%. <br>
The acid above may contain small amounts of NaClO<SMALL>4</SMALL> which may ppt out of solution. The acid can be distilled (use a Kieldahl bulb) if necessary.<br>
It is not advisable to store Perchloric Acid, make and use as required.<p>
Perchloric acid can be prepared from Barium Perchlorate and dilute Sulphuric acid. Sulphuric acid is slowly added to a solution of Barium Perchlorate until no more Barium Sulphate (insoluble) precipitates. The acid can be concentrated to 70% approx. by boiling until dense white fumes appear. Do not use concentrated Sulphuric acid as you will get concentrated Perchloric acid + the risk of formation of Cl2O7.<br> To quote: <i>Also avoid any risk when setting the HClO4 free from Ba(ClO4)2 or Ca(ClO4)2 from H2SO4 and never do it on dry salt with more than 70% H2SO4 because over 72% HClO4 becomes an hazardous compound...so expect an explosion (because of transcient Cl2O7) from H2SO4 (95% concentrate) and dry salt (btw dry salt is hard to get owing to strong hygroscopicity)...</i><p><br>

Another method to make Perchloric acid using Ammonium Perchlorate + HCl + Nitric acid is described by H. H.  WILLARD (see 'Further Reading' section). This method was attempted by 'Woelen' with little success as described <a href="woelen_p_acid.html"> here</a>.<p>


<h3> Uses of Perchloric acid</h3>


Perchlorates are the salts of Perchloric acid. Most of the Perchlorates can be produced by Perchloric acid and the Chloride or Nitrate of the metal and heating to drive off the HCl or HNO3 formed.<br>
All of the Perchlorates can  be formed by  reacting the appropriate Hydroxide or Carbonate with the acid. This method of production is not used because of the expense of Perchloric acid compared to Sodium Perchlorate, but it gives very pure Perchlorates.

<h2>Dangers</h2>
<pre>Some Accidents Involving Perchloric Acid 

1. Explosions may occur when 72% Perchloric acid is used to determine Chromium in steel, apparently due to the 
formation of mixtures of Perchloric acid vapor and Hydrogen. These vapor mixtures can be exploded 
by the catalytic  action of steel particles. 

2. Two workers are reported to have dried 11,000 samples of alkali-washed hydro-carbon gas with Magnesium 
Perchlorate over a period of 7 years without accident. However, one sample containing Butyl Fluoride caused a 
purple discoloration of the Magnesium Perchlorate, with the subsequent explosion of the latter. 

3 . A worker using Magnesium Perchlorate to dry  Argon reported an explosion and warned that warming and 
contact with oxidizable substances should be avoided. 

4. An explosion was reported when anhydrous Magnesium Perchlorate, used in drying unsaturated hydrocarbons, 
was heated to 220 degrees C. 

5 . An explosive reaction takes place between Perchloric acid and Bismuth or certain of its alloys,
 especially during electrolytic polishing.

 6. Several explosions reported as having occurred during the determination of Potassium as the Perchlorate are 
probably attributable to heating in the presence of concentrated Perchloric acid and traces of alcohol.
 An incident  in a French laboratory is typical: an experienced worker in the course of a separation of
 Sodium and Potassium removed a Platinum crucible containing a few decigrams of material and continued
 the heating on a small gas flame. An explosion pulverized the crucible, a piece of Platinum entering the 
 eye of the chemist. 

 7. A violent explosion took place in an exhaust duct from a laboratory hood in which Perchloric acid 
solution was being fumed over a gas plate. It blew out windows, bulged the exterior walls, lifted the roof, 
and extensively damaged equipment and supplies. Some time prior to the explosion, the hood had been used for
 the analysis of miscellaneous materials. The explosion apparently originated in deposits of Perchloric acid
 and organic material in the hood and duct. 

 8. A chemist was drying alcohol off a small Anode over a Bunsen burner in a hood reserved for tests involving 
Perchloric acid. An explosion tore the exhaust duct from the hood, bent a portion of the ductwork near 
the fan, and blew out many panes of window glass. 

9. An employee dropped a 7-pound (3.2 kg) bottle of Perchloric acid solution on a concrete floor. 
The liquid was taken up with sawdust and placed in a covered, metal waste can. Four hours later, 
a light explosion blew open the hinged cover of the can. A flash fire opened three sprinklers which promptly
 extinguished the fire. 

 10. A 7-pound bottle of Perchloric acid solution broke while an employee was unpacking a case containing 
three bottles. The spilled acid instantly set the wood floor on fire, but it was put out quickly with a
soda-acid extinguisher. 

11. At a malleable Iron foundry, Perchloric acid had been used for about 4 years in the laboratory for the
 determination of the Silicon contents of Iron samples. A cast Iron, wash-sink drain at the bench used for 
 this purpose had corroded and the leaking acid had soaked into the wood flooring, which was later ignited 
 while a Lead joint was being poured. This fire was extinguished and part of the woodflooring was removed. 
 Later in the day, at a point slightly removed from the location of the first fire, a similar fire occurred 
 when hot Lead was again spilled. This time the fire flashed with explosive violence into the exhaust hood 
 and stack above the workbench. Laboratory equipment and records were wetted down extensively and damaged. 

 12. A stone table of a fume hood was patched with a glycerin cement and several years later, when the hood 
was being removed, the table exploded when a worker struck the stone with a chisel. The hood had been used 
for digestions with Perchloric acid and, presumably, acid spills had not been properly cleaned up. 

13. A conventional chemical hood normally used for other chemical reactions, including distillation and 
washing of organic materials, was also used during the same time for perchloric acid digestion. 
During a routine washing procedure, the hot gases went up the 12-inch tubular transit exhaust duct and one 
of a series of explosions occurred that tore the duct apart at several angles and on the horizontal runs. 

14. During routine maintenance involving partial dismantling of the exhaust blower on a Perchloric acid
 ventilating system, a detonation followed a light blow with a hammer on a chisel held against the fan at 
or near the seal between the rear cover plate and the fan casing. The intensity of the explosion was such 
that it was heard 4 miles away. Of the three employees in the vicinity, one sustained face lacerations and
 slight eye injury; the second suffered loss of four fingers on one hand and possible loss of sight in one 
eye; the third was fatally injured with the 6-inch chisel entering below his left nostril and embedded in 
the brain. 

15. A 6-pound (2.7 kilograms) bottle of Perchloric acid broke and ran over a fairly large area of a 
wooden laboratory floor. It was cleaned up, but some ran down over wooden joists. Several years later a 
bottle of Sulfuric acid was spilled in this same location and fire broke out immediately in the floor and 
the joists. 

16. A chemist reached for a body of Perchloric acid stored on a window sill above a steam radiator. 
The bottle struck the radiator, broke, and the acid flowed over the hot coils. Within a few minutes the
 wooden floor beneath the radiator burst into flame. 

 17. An explosion occurred when an attempt was made to destroy Benzyl Celluloses by boiling with Perchloric acid. 
18. An explosion occurred as anhydrous Perchloric acid was being prepared via Sulfuric acid dehydration 
and extraction with Methylene Chloride when a stopper was removed from the separatory flask. 

19. A rat carcass was dissolved in Nitric acid, the fat skimmed off, and Perchloric acid added. The mixture 
was heated to dryness and touched, setting off an explosion that cracked the fume hood and nearly blew out 
the sash. 

20. A Perchlorate-doped polyacetylene film was prepared and stored under Argon in a seated vessel. 
Two weeks later, the film detonated when the vessel top was being removed. Earlier safety testing failed 
to show any reaction to flame or impact. 

21. Perchlorate-doped Polyacetylene samples combusted violently in the Oxygen atmosphere of a Schoniger flask. 

22. An explosion occurred in a fume hood upon Ether drying of a second crop of crystals of 
Hexaminechromium (III) Perchlorate that were washed with absolute Ethanol and anhydrous Diethylether. 
Following aspiration of the Ether wash, the Ether damp filter cake was agitated with a glass stirring rod
 and the mass detonated. 

 23. Perchlorate-doped, highly conducting Polythiophene Pt-CIO, exhibits excellent ambient stability, but 
the film should not be heated above 1000C. Touching an extremely dry Pt-CIO, film (kept in a desiccator
 over P20,) with tweezers might cause an explosion of the film. 

24. Some samples of rare earth organic Fluoride were re-ashed with Perchloric, Sulfuric, and Nitric acid in I
 liter beakers. One of the beakers started foaming, turned yellow, and then exploded. The surface of the 
 hot plate was bent downward, and the imprint of the beaker was left in the metal surface of the hot plate 
 by the force of the explosion. 

 25. Drying an Acetonitrile adduct of Neodymium Perchlorate at 5OC in vacuum apparently produces a compound 
 that can detonate on mechanical contact.
