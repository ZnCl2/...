<h2>Is it Pure? Testing for Chlorates</H2>
The following is from Swede's blog on at WWW.APCFORUM.NET<BR>

One of the most critical things you can do</b> when you manufacture perchlorates is to ensure that your product is, in fact, free of chlorate contamination.  There&#39;s no reason to bother converting your chlorate to perchlorate if you are not going to clean it up... you may as well use the chlorate itself.<br /><br />There are a few methods to test for chlorate.  I am not going to go into them in detail, except for one.  Suffice it to say that none of them is totally simple AND sensitive.  It&#39;s not like dipping pH paper.  It takes a bit of effort to create a sensitive test, but of course it&#39;s worth it.<br /><br />One of the tests I tried makes use of a chemical called N-Phenylanthranilic Acid, which I will call NPAA.  NPAA is not something you buy in a feed store.  It took some effort to obtain 50 grams of so, and it is not cheap.  The good news is, a little goes a long way.  The bad news is, the traditional test procedure itself, as Wouter Visser describes it on his excellent website, frankly sucks, and I think I have come up with a better way to do it.<br /><br /><div align='center'>

</div><br /><br />NPAA comes as a fine, grey powder, with a bit of a funky smell.  It is not particularly hazardous.  Wouter&#39;s procedure is to dissolve a small amount in concentrated sulfuric acid, and then add a few drops of this to your aqueous sample.  A brown or red coloration is indicative of chlorate presence, while a white precipitate indicates pure perchlorate. This is the result, using Wouter&#39;s method, on three different test samples:<br /><br /><div align='center'>

<img src="npaa02.jpg">

</div><br /><br />It <i>kind of</i> worked.  The sample far right is commercial perchlorate.  The other two were intentionally chlorate-contaminated in varying degrees.  Overall I didn&#39;t think this test had good sensitivity, and as-described by Wouter, I simply didn&#39;t care for it.  Getting significant color required too much acid, which chews up the goods, as I am guessing the ratio of acid to NPAA is too high.  It is the NPAA that creates the color <i>in an acid environment.</i> Dissolving NPAA in sulfuric is a pain; storing it in that state, ready to use, is out of the question.<br /><br />I thought a bit... NPAA is simply an indicator. Why not use something else to carry the NPAA, then slowly acidify the sample with the sulfuric?  This way, I can go heavy or light with the indicator stock, and acidify <i>as needed</i> to develop the coloration if it is there.<br /><br />I dissolved a very small amount of NPAA in 99% isopropyl alcohol, which promptly turned a transparent grey color.  I also added some concentrated sulfuric acid to an erlenmeyer flask, ready to use as needed.  The tincture of NPAA is on the right:<br /><br /><div align='center'>

<img src="npaa06.jpg">

</div><br /><br />My first test was to repeat the earlier effort with three samples, 1.0 g/l chlorate, saturated chlorate, and commercial perchlorate.  Aqueous samples are used.  I strongly recommend you DO NOT drip concentrated sulfuric acid on unknown, powdered oxidizers&#33;  Three test tubes were prepared with the samples.  The sample size was small, just enough to cover the bottom of the test tube.  Into each, I added three drops of the indicator tincture.  This immediately produces a white precipitate in all cases, as seen here:<br /><br /><div align='center'>

<img src="npaa07.jpg">

</div><br /><br />Then, each sample received 5 drops of concentrated sulfuric.  If you see color, but it disappears, add a few more drops of sulfuric.  The color then stabilizes.  Here are the results:<br /><br /><div align='center'>

<img src="npaa08.jpg">

</div><br /><br />All right&#33;  Looks good&#33;  Interestingly, the sample that had a lower chlorate concentration produced a deeper coloration. The colors do seem to vary, but ANY discernible color equals chlorate contamination.<br /><br />The next step... how sensitive is it?  If the test is not sensitive enough, it&#39;s useless.  I diluted my 1.0 g/l sample by ten, creating a 0.1 g/l chlorate solution.  Was it sensitive enough to detect this low level?<br /><br /><div align='center'>

<img src="npaa10.jpg"></div><br /><br />

The colour can be easily seen. <br /><br />The sample was cut by a factor of 10 again, creating a 0.01 g/l chlorate solution.<br /><br /><div align='center'>

<img src="npaa11.jpg">

</div><br /><br />NOW it&#39;s getting tricky.  The picture doesn&#39;t show it well, but there was a discernible color.  0.01 g/l is like a pinhead of chlorate tossed in a one liter bottle.  Excellent sensitivity.  After this test, I halted any further dilutions... I knew the procedure worked.<br /><br />The next interesting test for me was to check my raw, recently harvested perchlorate.  I was under no illusion that it would be pure, and I fully expected strong coloration.  I was not disappointed...<br /><br /><div align='center'>

<img src="npaa14.jpg">

</div><br /><br />It didn&#39;t even have the dignity to turn a pretty shade - it looked more like mouse turds in water.<br /><br />The test development was a total success, and the use of a tincture of NPAA vs. dissolving it in sulfuric allows for a MUCH easier test procedure.  It also allows me to store the tincture in a ready to use form.  The other promising chlorate test Wouter describes makes use of indigo carmine, HCl, and a bit of boiling. If I can get away from boiling, especially boiling HCl, I&#39;m all for it, and will stick with the NPAA test, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll try the indigo carmine at some point.<br />
