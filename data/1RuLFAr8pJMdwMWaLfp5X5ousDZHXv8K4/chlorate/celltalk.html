<h1> Some cell design examples</H1><p>
Example 1<br>
<font color=maroon>The designer has decided that he wants to make  1Kg of Sodium Chlorate per week. he is not too strapped for cash.</font>
<P><h4>How much Anode surface area needed:</h4><p>
He has no Anode(s) or no power supply yet. By looking at the run times section for Sodium Chlorate
on this page the following fact is noted. <br>

<italic> In a typical non pH controlled Amateur cell you will get 0.00596 grams Chlorate formed per minute per Amp.</italic>
<br> 
That’s the same as 60.0768 grams formed per week per amp (There are 10,080 minutes in a week)
Therefore to make 1000 Grams  per week you will need to run 1000/60.0768 = 16.64 Amps (say 17).<br>
Looking at the max. allowable current densities on the different Anode materials will give figures 
similar(ish) to theses: Platinum 300mA/square cm, Graphite 30mA/square cm, Lead Dioxide 300mA/square cm,
and Magnetite 30mA/square cm. He may like to run his Pt, LD, or Magnetite Anodes at a higher current density as the figures above are fairly conservative.
He will not want to run his Graphite Anode at a higher current density so as to keep erosion at bay.<br>
Having decided what Anode material he is going to use he then sets about deciding how much surface area
he needs on the Anode. Assuming Graphite, he will need 17/.03 = 566 square cm Min. That’s the Anode surface
area that is immersed in the electrolyte remember. He then decides if he is going to use Gouging rods,
EDM Graphite or some other Graphite. He may wish to use the Graphite at a much lower Anode current density to keep Anode erosion ever lower. If he wishes to halve current density, he will do so my simply doubling the Anode surface area. If using rod shaped electrodes be advised that as the rod wears it will have a smaller surface area, the current density will rise (assuming current into cell remains the same) and wear rate will increase. It may be advisable to start with a low current density so that as the Anode wears the current density will not go above 30mA per square cm. If using flat pieces of Graphite the Anode wear will not have much effect on the surface area of Anode. <br>


<P><h4>How much NaCl: </h4><p>
In order to make 1Kg of Chlorate you need exactly (1000 X 0.55) grams of NaCl. The 0.55 comes from the division  of the molecular weights. The electrolytic cell and the 
Anode will not operate under such clear cut conditions. You will need at least 100 grams per litre NaCl
to be left in the cell after your run so that the conditions for Graphite Anode erosion are met. If you try
to use up all the Chloride the Anode will get eaten away rapidly coming toward the end of the run.<br>
<big>So:</big> We need to use at least 550 grams of salt for to be converted to Chlorate + 100 grams per litre to be left in the cell at the end of the run. He will need a container that will hold approx. 3 litres of solution. This is a minimum size. If you run 17 amps into this 3 litre container you will have problems keeping it cool. Better to just use a container that is much much bigger than this. About 25 litres would be great filled with saturated NaCl solution. This will stay cool. About 330 grams NaCl will dissolve in 1 litre of water. At 17 amps you will still get the 
same amount of product forming (assuming similar current efficiency which is probable). It may not suit the impatient amateur as he will not be able to draw product from this larger container until a few weeks have passed. He may add Chromate, Persulphate or NaF to increase current efficiency. He will add water to the cell to keep volume steady. He may add salt solution. If he adds salt solution he needs to factor this into the run time. <p>



<h4> Power supply:</h4>
He will probably purchase his power supply. The exact output voltage of the power supply needed to drive
17 amps into the cell is unknown. It will be somewhere between 3 and 6 volts. He will probably purchase a DC power supply having the ability to supply at least 17 amps at a fixed voltage anywhere between 1 and 10 volts. The power supply will have a nice current meter to tell him what amps are going into his cell. It will also have (though not essential) a nice volt meter to tell him what voltage is across his cell. He will be careful that he does not become too obsessed with the voltage across the cell. The current going into the cell may vary a small amount as the cell runs. The temperature, ageing of Anodes and changing concentrations of salts will vary the resistance of the cell somewhat. He may have to adjust the voltage a bit to keep current at exactly 17 amps. He may choose not to worry about the fact that the current is not staying at exactly 17 amps. <br> If he is very dedicated to Chlorate making he will purchase a power supply that has the ability to put a programmed current (a power supply which is a fixed current source) into his cell. He will set the supply to put 17 amps into his cell. There will be a meter for measuring current and (for interest) a meter to measure the voltage across the cell. The current going into the cell will remain rock steady at 17 amps, the voltage across the cell may vary a bit as the resistance of the cell varies. <p>

<h4>Cathodes:</h4>
He will choose cathodes that will be at least similar surface area to the Anode(s) and place them around the Anode(s) in a sensible fashion. It is wise to place cathodes each side of Graphite Anodes in order to keep the current distribution on the Anode surface fairly even. If he were to place the Cathodes at one end of the cell, the current density on the side of the Anodes closest to the Cathodes will likely have a greater value than the side that is not toward the Cathodes which will have consequences for erosion, especially with Graphite.


<hr><br> Example 2<br>
<font color=maroon> The Amateur has a computer power supply and he is thinking of purchasing some Gouging rods from EBAY and he wants to make as much Chlorate as he possibly can. He is rather strapped for cash. He has a multimeter.</FONT>
<P><h4>How much Anode surface area needed:</h4><p>
Firstly test supply with a resistor to see if it is working.
We have a power supply that puts out a fixed voltage of 5 volts DC and a few other voltage outputs (12V and others). We use the 5 volt output which is the main output. The supply also has a maximum current output on this 5 volt output which is hopefully stated on the supply. The maximum current that this line can  supply is the maximum current you can put into you cell without risking damage to the supply. Calculate the Anode surface area from this maximum available current. Say the maximum current is 10 amps this means that you need at least an Anode surface area in the electrolyte of 10/.03 = 334 square cm. (This comes from the fact that you want to keep the Anode current density below 30mA per square cm to keep Graphite erosion at bay). How many Gouging rods do you need to give you this surface area? The area of a rod is (ignoring the small circle at the bottom of the rod) Pi X Dia. X h (remember h is the length of rod actually in the electrolyte). Use at least this amount of rods. It would be great to use twice as many to keep Anode current density real low and therefore keep erosion low. This is especially true as the Gouging rods wear, their surface area will decrease, current density will increase and erosion will increase.
<P><h4>How much NaCl:</h4><p>
 Use a container that is about 10 litres or larger in size filled with saturated NaCl solution. About 330 grams NaCl will dissolve in 1 litre of water. Use a 20 (or a 30!!) litre container if you like. Calculate the run time and keep in mind that you must stop running the cell when you have got to the stage where you have 100 grams per litre (definitely keep above 50) Chloride so as to keep erosion on the Graphite to a sensible limit. He may add Chromate, Persulphate or NaF to increase current efficiency though them do not make much difference.
<h4>Cathodes:</h4>
He will choose cathodes that will be at least similar surface area to the Anode(s) and place them around the Anode(s) in a sensible fashion. It is wise to place cathodes each side of Graphite Anodes in order to keep the current distribution on the Anode surface fairly even. If he were to place the Cathodes at one end of the cell, the current density on the side of the Anodes closest to the Cathodes will likely have a greater value than the side that is not toward the Cathodes which will have consequences for erosion, especially with Graphite. 
<p><h4>Running the cell:</h4>
The supply is connected and the voltage and current is measured. The current will be measured to ascertain how much product you will be making per week and to see that the supply is not being abused.  Be sure that the multimeter will take the current that may be flowing. It may be lower that the supply rated current as the supply may have heated up so much that the thermal shutdown in the supply has come into play. You can put the Anodes and Cathodes further apart or put diode(s) in series with the line going into the cell in order to raise the resistance seen by the supply (this will lower the current below the maximum that the supply can handle). Run the set-up so that the current is below the maximum (say 10% below) allowable for the supply. You will have 5 volts across the supply terminals  at this point because the supply is a fixed voltage type of supply that was made to supply current at a fixed five volts.  If you have used diode(s) to manipulate the current through the cell, the voltage across the cell will be less that the voltage across the supply by (0.9 X [number of diodes]) volts.<br> The amount of Chlorate you will be making will be:<br>60.0768 grams per week per amp, 9 amps will give you 540 grams per week. (assuming around 50% current efficiency. You will not be able to 
crop this amount in the first week as it stays in solution due to the high solubility of Sodium Chlorate. It depends how much electrolyte you have started off with. You need to run the cell for the amount of time as described elsewhere on this page. He will add water or salt solution to the cell to keep the volume constant. If he uses salt solution he will need to factor this into the run time. Be patient.
<p><hr>

Example 3<br>
<font color=maroon>The designer has a Lead Dioxide Anode and a huge 12 Volt battery charger. He is not to concerned with making the maximum Chlorate possible per week but he is very impatient and wants Chlorate NOW.</font>
<P><h4>How much Anode surface area has the Anode:</h4><p>
The amount of the Anode that will actually be in the electrolyte is used to calculate the surface area of the Anode. A current density of 300mA per square cm is easily accommodated with a Lead Dioxide Anode. He may wish to run his Anode at a smaller current if he so wishes but since he is impatient for product he may decide to run the Anode at a higher current density. Assuming the area of the Anode is 70 square cm, this will allow a current of 70 X 0.300 =  21 Amps to be run though cell. 

 <P><h4>How much NaCl:</h4><p>
The cell volume will be kept small so that Chlorate can be extracted as soon as possible. Looking at run times described elsewhere on this page he sees that with 21 amps running into the cell will give him about 21 X 0.00596 = 0.12516 grams Chlorate formed per minute, which is 180 grams per day. He will set up his cell so that he can extract Chlorate after two days, ie. 360 grams theoretical. In order to make 360 grams Chlorate, 360 X 0.55 = 198 grams Chloride are needed. Since Lead Dioxide does not get eroded by low Chloride concentration there is no need to have a quantity of 'buffer' Chloride in the cell as far as Anode erosion is concerned. It will be impossible to convert all of the 198 grams of salt into 360 grams Chlorate as run times are (as described elsewhere) based on having a decent amount of Chloride in the cell at the end of each run. He will use 270 grams NaCl dissolved in somewhat less than one litre of water. Also if he uses too little Chloride he may get Perchlorate forming if the concentration of Chloride falls below (approx.) 10 grams per litre.  He may add NaF or Persulphate but not Chromate to increase current efficiency.
<h4>Cathodes:</h4>
He will choose cathodes that will be at least similar surface area to the Anode and place them around the Anode in a sensible fashion. It is wise to place Cathodes each side of the Anode in order to keep the current distribution on the Anode surface fairly even. If he were to place the Cathodes at one end of the cell, the current density on the side of the Anode closest to the Cathodes will likely have a greater value than the side that is not toward the Cathodes which will probably have consequences for erosion. Lead Dioxide is fairly robust though.
<p><h4>Running the cell:</h4>
The cell is less than one litre is size and has  21 Amps going into it. This cell will heat up too much. The cell can be placed sitting in a large container of water so as to keep it cool. The power supply will be set up to run 21 amps through the cell. The open circuit voltage of the (big) battery charger will be approx. 13 volts. When connected to the cell it will probably send too much (more that 21 amps) into the cell. The current going into the cell can be decreased by adding a resistor or diodes in series with the input of the cell. The voltage across the cell will be in the region of 4 to 6.5 Volts (approx.)  The voltage across the charger will be 12   volts nominal. The current going into the cell will not be a perfect smoothed DC but this is not a problem. It will be difficult to measure the exact effective current because of this. There will probably be a current meter on the charger which will give an accurate enough indication of the current. If a battery of reasonable quality is connected to the charger it will act a a huge capacitor and the set up will have a nice steady current (and Voltage) going into the cell. If no battery is available it is OK. The cell will be run for 2 days and the Chlorate extracted by evaporating some of the water away and letting it crystallize out. If he does not turn of the power after 3 days he may get Perchlorate starting to form. <br> After a crop or two of Chlorate he may decide to be more patient regarding the process, use a much larger container and allow Chlorate to accumulate before extraction. He will add water to the cell to keep volume steady. He will not add salt solution since he want Chlorate quickly.

Example 4 <br>
<font color=maroon>The designer has a bench power supply with a maximum output current of 3 amps. He is going to purchase some Platinum wire or a Platinum clad Anode. Cash is scarce.</font>
<P><h4>How much Anode surface area should he purchase:</h4><p>
This is entirely up to himself. He will look at the price of the wire and weep. If he wants to run the set-up at the max. current that his supply can give (looking at typical current densities used for Pt. of 300mA per square cm) he will need 3 amps/0.300 amps = 10 square cm of Platinum in the electrolyte. He will purchase Pt wire with a sensible diameter which will carry 3 amps. If he purchases Pt. of (say) A.W.G.(B & S) = 42 (that’s S.W.G. between 45 & 46) this will have a diameter of 2.5 thousands of an inch. This measly wire will not carry 3 amps. It will melt. He will purchase wire of approx. 25 A.W.G (26-27 S.W.G) which will carry 
3 amps. This wire is still thin, around 19 A.W.G. would be nice so that the Anode will be self supporting. <br>
The surface area of a cylinder is D X Pie X L. Assuming we use 19 A.W.G. (D = 0.9119mm) we need a length of wire which is <br> 10/(3.142 X 0.09119) = 35 cm. He will need another inch to come up out of the cell, say 38 cm total length. He will bend the wire into a shape for to use as the Anode. Some like to wind the wire onto a former (say a glass tube). Winding the wire onto a tube will have some consequences for current distribution on the Anode. The Anode will have a very small current density on the wire next to the tube, it will have a larger current density on the side of the wire away from the tube. Keep this in mind. It would be good to wind the wire in a spiral of about 2 inches Dia. that is self supporting. <BR>
The price of this Anode will not be small. The smaller the Dia. of the wire you use the less Dollars you need to spend to get a certain surface area.  See the section on the Pt. Anode. You could buy half the length suggested and squeeze (run through a mandrill) or hammer the wire so that it's surface area is doubled (or more) thus saving Dollars. <br>
If he uses a Platinum clad Anode all his current carrying problems will end as the substrate of the Anode will carry 3 amps easily. He still needs 10 cm squared of Anode area in the electrolyte. <BR>
Since the Anode is so expensive he may decide to purchase less surface area and run the Anode at a higher current density, still running 3 amps into cell. Pt. will take quite a high current density without eroding. He could also purchase light wire that will not carry 3 amps but will carry (say) 0.5 amps. He will cut this wire into 6 equal lengths and have 6 Anodes coming out of the cell connected to a bus bar (like a comb arrangement). Anode surface area in the electrolyte must still be 10 square cm to give similar erosion conditions to the single Anode. The 6 Anodes will save cash and give him more work.

<P><h4>How much NaCl:</h4><p>

Looking at the run time section elsewhere on this page it is noted that 3 amps will give you (0.00596 X 3) = 0.01788 grams Chlorate formed per minute = 180.25 grams per week (current efficiency about 50%). This will use 180.25 X 0.55 = 100 grams Chloride per week. The 0.55 comes from division of the molecular weights of NaCl and Na Chlorate. Assuming that he wants to harvest Chlorate once per week he will need  100 grams Chloride in solution + (about) 100 grams Chloride per litre left at the end of the run so that erosion of the Anode is kept at bay and to keep current efficiency at a sensible level. Platinum will erode somewhat if used in a cell that has a low Chloride concentration in it. About 330 grams NaCl will dissolve in 1 litre of water. He will dissolve approx. 145 grams NaCl in about 0.45 litres water.  After a week approx. 40 grams of Chloride will be left per 100ml solution. He will stop his cell at that point so that erosion of the Anode is kept at bay. He will add NaF, Chromate or Persulphate to increase current efficiency. He may decide to top up the cell with water or salt solution. If he used salt solution he must factor this into the run time.
 

<h4>Cathodes:</h4>
He will choose cathodes that will be at least similar surface area to the Anode(s) and place them around the Anode(s) in a sensible fashion. It is wise to place cathodes on all sides of Anodes in order to keep the current distribution on the Anode surface fairly even. If he were to place the Cathodes at one end of the cell, the current density on the side of the Anodes closest to the Cathodes will likely have a greater value than the side that is not toward the Cathodes which will have consequences for erosion. If he has a spiral type Anode he will place a rod inside the coil and a few (3 perhaps) around the outside of the coil. If he has a flat Platinised Anode he will place a sheet each side of the Anode.


<p><h4>Running the cell:</h4>

He connects his bench power supply up to the cell.  + to Anode, - to Cathode. He increases the voltage until He gets 3 amps to flow. He will keep an eye on the current so that it does not increase above 3 amps and abuse the power supply. The current will vary somewhat as the resistance of the cell varies due to temperature and solute concentration changes. The voltage will be in the region of 3 to 6 volts. He may wish to connect a high wattage resistor (or a bulb of the correct size) in series with the power supply and increase the voltage of his power supply so that the current flowing will not be so dependent on the whims of the cell. Doing this will not increase the voltage across the cell. If he uses a 1 ohm resistor (with at least 3 watts dissipation ability) and increases the voltage of his power supply by 3 volts the current will still be 3 amps. As the resistance of the cell varies the current will not vary quite so much, as the added resistor 'swamps' or helps to mask the effects of changing cell resistance. The supply (now consisting of a voltage supply + a resistor) has some characteristics of a controlled current source. If he is not too worried about the current varying a little bit (or he doesn't’t know/care what the heck I am talking about) then he can leave the resistor out. <p>
