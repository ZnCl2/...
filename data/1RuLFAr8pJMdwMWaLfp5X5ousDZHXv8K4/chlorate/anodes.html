<b> Anode Overvoltage</b><br>
Overpotential or Overvoltage refers to the excess electrical potential over theoretical potential at which the desired element is discharged at the electrode surface. <br>
It will obviously vary with the different Anode materials. It also varies from electrolyte to electrolyte given a fixed Anode material. It also varies with current density, age, temperature etc. For Chlorate making we would like an Anode with a low Chlorine overpotential and a higher Oxygen overpotential. Because 
Amateur Chlorate cells are (usually) not pH controlled, we also need an Anode material with a low overpotential for the Oxidation of Hypochlorite ion.<br>
 For Perchlorate making we want a material with a low potential for both the Anodic Oxidation of water (to give adsorbed OH radicals) and the discharge of the Chlorate ion. A high Oxygen overpotential is also very disirable. The higher the Oxygen overpotential the better because it means that Oxygen gas will not be generated at the Anode. Oxygen forming at the Anode is a leakage current we do not want and is one of the reasons for not getting 100% current efficiency when making Chlorate or (especially) Perchlorate. It  also wears the Anode. <p>
<br><B>Catalytic activity of Anode material<br></B>
The Catalytic activity is very much tied into the different Anodic overpotenitals of the Anode material and is really the same subject from a slightly different point of view.<br>
 When making Chlorate in a non pH controlled cell, Chlorate is produced at the Anode surface by Oxidation of Hypochlorite ion to Chlorate (also known as 'Anodic Chlorate formation', or 'Making Chlorate by electricity', see Cell Chem. section).  In industrial cells a different  reaction takes place in the bulk of the solution (after Chlorine is produced at the Anode) as the pH is favourable for the appropriate species to be present in the proper ratio in the liquid for these so called 'bulk'  reactions (also known as 'Chemical Chlorate formation') to happen. <br>
 In industry the Anodic Oxidation of Hypochlorite   is very undesirable and is avoided. In amateur non-pH controlled cells it is the way all the Chlorate gets produced. The Anode material must therefor   have Catalytic activity for the evolution of Cl<sup>-</sup> and in addition to this must have catalytic activity for the Oxidation of Hypohlorite ion in the non-pH controlled Chlorate cell. <br>
Magnetite has poor to zero activity for the Oxidation of Hypochlorite ion. Pt, C, MMO and MnO2  are OK.    PbO2 is not very good AFAICS.<BR>
In the Perchlorate cell certain species get adsorbed (form a thin coating) on the Anode and reactions happen at the Anode surface only. The Anode material must not incourage the formation of Oxygen or it will be the dominant reaction and no Perchlorate will get formed.

    <TD>Graphite or Carbon</TD>
    <TD>Graphite is a dense form of the element Carbon. The terms Graphite and 
      Carbon are sometimes used interchangeably.<BR>Dense Graphite is much 
      better than Carbon (softer and more porous than Graphite) as far as 
      erosion is concerned.
 <br>Graphite or Carbon can be make to last longer by 
      impregnating it with Linseed oil or some other substance to plug  pores in order to decrease  shredding. Dense 
      Graphite cannot be impregnated with the oil. Proper pH control of the cell is of huge significance in regards to erosion too.<br> 
       Carbon can 
      be purchased at welding supply shops in the form of Gouging rods, and it 
      is very advantageous to treat them with Linseed oil or other products, to make them last longer as they are very porous. <br>Gouging rods are manufactured in 
various ways and may even contain Iron particles. That may be good for gouging, not so good for Chlorate making.<br>
      Dense Graphite can be purchased at engineering supply shops where it is 
      used in EDM's (Electro Discharge Machines). <br>
 Carbon rods from dry cell batteries can also be used. A large Graphite art pencil can also be used successfully. <br>
      Industrial users of Graphite keep the temperature below 40&deg;C, Chloride concentration above 100g/l  and current density  between 33 &amp; 43 mA 
      per square cm therefor Graphite Anodes will be big and bulky compared to other types.<br> It should be noted that as 
      Graphite rods erode their surface area gets less and less. Therefor the 
      current density will increase  as will erosion. Bear this in 
      mind when using Graphite rods.<br>
Controlling the pH of the cell will  have a huge influence on erosion.  Figures from Industry regarding Graphite erosion 
      are very  impressive, being as low as 4 kg per Ton Sodium Chlorate (4  grams per kg Na Chlorate). <br>
There is information regarding pH controlled amateur cells in the 'Graphite Anode' section below. The big Anode killers are high pH and a Chloride concentration below 30 grams per liter.<p>

Graphite will NOT make Perchlorate in any sensible fashion.
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Lead Dioxide</TD>
    <TD>A good Lead Dioxide Anode will last a long time and it is not effected 
      by high temperature's (within reason, below 55&deg;C) or low Chloride or Chlorate levels. 
      If Chloride levels get low in the Chlorate cell (approximately 50g per litre Chloride), 
      Perchlorate will start to form. You should not use  Chromate additive with a Lead 
      Dioxide Anode as Chromate's lower 
      current efficiency by forming a thin layer on the surface of the Anode. 
      Anode current densities of 80mA  to 300mA  per square cm  can be 
      used. The lower current densities are used in Chlorate cells as current efficiency will suffer if a high current density is used.  High current densities do 
not effect current efficiency in Perchlorate cells, in fact it improves CE.<br>
Lead Dioxide is the <I>HOLY GRAIL </I>of Anodes. It can be let run 
      and run until all Chloride has turned to Perchlorate which saves a great 
      amount of labour. This in not a sensible way to proceed though IMO.  The Ti substrate Anode is the way forward for LD Anodes.<br>
	  It is a good idea to have a small quanitiy of Sulphate (few grams per liter) in a Lead Dioxide cell so that any Lead that may become soluble will be precipitated as insoluble Lead Sulphate.
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Platinum</TD>
    <TD>Platinum is a good Anode but is expensive. It will make Chlorate and Perchlorate.<br>
  Erosion increases if Chloride levels are low in a  Chlorate cell and also if Chlorate levels are low in a  Perchlorate cell. The presence of Chloride in a Perchlorate cell also increases erosion. If using this Anode material to make Perchlorate, start with a cell that has
	  zero (0.00%) Chloride in it and use Dichromate to stop Chloride formation at the Cathode and thus help protect the Anode.<br>
	  Pt can be plated onto Valve metals (Ti, Ta, Hf, Nb). Anodes used by industry are often Platinum clad (as opposed to electroplated). If purchasing a plated Valve metal Anode be aware of the coating thickness as some are very thin. Pt depths of 1.27 to 2.54 micron  have been reported for Chlorine production Anodes with wear rates of 0.5 grams per ton Chlorine (Metals Handbook).
<br> Pt/Ir alloys (choice of industry) with current density's as 
      high as 750mA per square cm have seen use in Perchlorate cells. Pt is not too temperature sensitive 
      as far as corrosion is concerned, keep below 40C. Current densities can be 
      high at 300mA and up, 600mA has been use in a commercial cell for 
      Perchlorate.<BR>Wear rates of 500 to 220mg/Tonne have been stated. Smooth 
      Pt, for example wire, (same as electro deposited Pt) is preferred as its 
      wear rate is less that other forms of Pt, like for example thermally 
      deposited coatings.  <br> Pool Chlorination Anodes are sometimes Pt based (as opposed to MMO). </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>DSA<BR>or<br>MMO</TD>
    <TD>MMO (Mixed Metal Oxide (Trade Name: DSA (Dimensionally Stable 
      Anode)), usually made from the Oxides of Noble Metals, Ru and Ir,   on a Titanium (a Valve metal) substrate. Used by ALL Chlorate Industrial setup's nowadays. Not recommended  to be used 
      in electrolytes where the Chloride level has been let drop very low 
      (30g/l absolute minimum), better to keep at or above 50g/l Chloride. They can be used 
      at relatively high current densities, 300mA per square cm, around 200mA per square cm could be considered a working value. There are a range of MMO types on the market. In corrosion prevention 
      applications they are used in very low Chloride concentrations at low current density. They are also used in swimming pool Chlorination systems.<br>
MMO will not make Perchlorate AFAIK though some types (Pt Oxide based) may be capable of making Perchlorate.<br> MMO should not be 
      operated at high temperatures. Pool Chlorination Anodes are mostly MMO Anodes though sometimes they are Pt metal based.  Do not use Fluoride additive with MMO.
      <P></P></TD>
  <TR>
    <TD>Magnetite</TD>
    <TD>It has been used to make Chlorates in Japan (and India) up to (and 
      beyond?) 1971. Anodes last a long time in a 
      Chlorate cell even if there are low Chloride concentrations. Current 
      density's up to 30mA per square cm have been used in Industry. Current 
      density is not limited by erosion concerns but rather by economic reasons as current efficiency suffers a lot. High temperatures do not erode them,  up to 70C. They will not lower the Chloride concentration efficiently to low levels 
      possibly because of their surface electro chemistry. <BR>
You must use pH control in order to obtain Chlorate. Magnetite will make Perchlorate but at a rather low CE.
</tr><tr><td>Ferrite</td><td>
Ferrite's, as used 
      in high frequency transformers and radio aerials, will not make Chlorate 
      as they are not conductive. There is a type of ferrite from www.dextermag.com, N102, as described 
	  <A href="n102.pdf"> here</a> that can be used to make Chlorate. Had no reports from anyone using this material.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Manganese Dioxide (MnO<small>2</small>)</TD>
    <TD>This Anode will make Chlorates very successfully. In a  Perchlorate cell it erodes. This Anode is easy to make and has been shown to work in a K Chlorate cell for 100 days. Use at approx. 50mA per square cm. pH control does not seem to make the Anode last longer time wise.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Spinal Cobalt Oxide (Co<SMALL>3</SMALL>O<SMALL>4</SMALL>)</TD>
    <TD>This Anode will make Chlorates
      and Perchlorates but  it will not stand up to Chlorate cells for more than a few days. It only lasts for hours in a Perchlorate cell.</TD></TR>
<tr><td>Sn Oxide Anodes</td><td> The Tin Oxide Anode doped with Antimony is not a very successful Chlorate or Perchlorate Anode.  Tin Oxide doped with Bi Oxide is stated to be useful for Perchlorate production in a US Patent.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Diamond </TD><TD>The Boron Doped Diamond Anode will make Chlorates and Perchlorates. It is very expensive.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>Pyrochlores </TD><TD>These are made by baking. They may turn out to be a winner. No one has made or tried them AFAIK</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Titanium, Gold, Tungsten, Tantalum etc</TD>
    <TD>Theses metals will not make Chlorate or Perchlorate. 'Titanium Anodes' are mentioned as being used for Chlorate production. It is Ti with a coating of MMO that is really being referred to.</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Lead</TD>
    <TD>Lead will make Chlorate and Perchlorate as (badly adhering) Lead Dioxide forms on its surface. Be prepared for a 
      toxic mess as the Anode will corrode from the beginning. 
</TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Lead/Acid <br>battery<br>plates</TD>
    <TD>Car battery plates have been suggested as Anodes for cells 1001 times. I have not read any reports of success using them. They will fall apart
or passivate soon after going to work. The Lead Dioxide in held in a Lead metal mesh. It is not hard and compact like a proper LD Anode. The Lead
mesh is also exposed and will erode.
