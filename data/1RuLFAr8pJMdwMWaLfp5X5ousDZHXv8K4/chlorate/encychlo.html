<P><PRE>
 CHLORATES, ELECTROLYTIC PRODUCTION

   Sodium and potassium chlorate are produced commercially by electrolysis 
of aqueous solutions of the corresponding chlorides. Other chlorates, which 
have only limited commercial use, are made from sodium chlorate by 
metathesis.
   The sodium salt, NAClO3, is made in an electrolytic cell having no 
diaphragm and usually having anodes made from impregnated graphite. A few 
cells in this country now use lead dioxide anodes, while magnetite is also 
employed to some extent in European cells. Anodes may also be made of 
platinum or platinum-clad titanium. Mild steel is widely used for cathodes, 
although stainless steel and graphite are also employed. Steel, plastic, or 
concrete are used for cell bodies. Cell covers are plastic, asbestos-cement, 
or some other inert, nonconductive material.<br>

   This reaction is favored at temperatures above 30C and at a pH below 7. 
Under alkaline conditions and temperatures below 30C the hypochlorate will 
remain unreacted. A typical chlorate cell is shown in Fig. 1.

Chlorate cells are operated at such a low temperature that not all of the 
heat produced can be carried off by evaporation of water from the 
electrolyte. Therefore, cooling coils are customarily employed. These coils 
are usually of steel, located within the cell, and are bonded to the cathode 
to provide protection against corrosion. External cooling of circulated 
electrolyte may also be used. Owing to the decrease of overvoltage at 
higher temperatures, and its effect on heat generation, the thermal 
conditions are inherently stable and cooling water may be controlled by a 
setting on a hand operated valve. The difference between the cell voltage 
and the theoretical decomposition voltage (2.3 volts) represents the heat 
which must be removed from the cell by cooling methods. 
  Electrical supply and arrangement of chlorate cell systems are similar to 
those used in chlorine plants. Cells are usually connected in one or more 
electrical series operating at up to 600 volts, but the electrolyte and 
cooling water flows are in parallel.
   The cell covers are provided with a gas duct system to vent the byproduct 
gas. Cell gas, principally hydrogen contaminated with oxygen and chlorine to 
the degree that it is usually not recovered, is vented to the atmosphere. In 
some systems air is drawn in over the vapor space and mixed with the 
hydrogen to drop its concentration below the explosive limit. Cells may 
also be sealed and operated with a high hydrogen content in the vent gas.
   Some facilities employ cells having bipolar electrodes which are arranged 
to divide a long narrow cell container into a large number of parallel 
chambers, each being an individual cell. One side of each electrode is 
anodic with the opposite side being the cathode in the next chamber. Current 
is introduced into the first electrode of the battery and leaves from the 
last. This arrangement allows a very simple electrical bus system and a 
compact arrangement of the cells.
   No outstanding advantages can be attributed to any particular cell 
design. The operating success of a plant is usually a function of the 
chlorate plant in its entirety. Whereas past practices have involved cells 
containing a large volume of dead space to allow retention time for the 
conversion of hypochlorite to chlorate and various cascade systems to allow 
for liquor flow through groups of cells in series, present practice tends 
toward large cells having no dead space and simple parallel liquor flow 
through individual cells. Advantages of this trend arise from the greater 
electrolyzing capacity per unit area of floor space and from simplified
operation of the cells. These changes in design have not resulted in any 
apparent loss in current efficiency.
   Chlorate cells are not particularly sensitive to variations in operating 
conditions and will produce satisfactorily within a wide range for each
variable. Thus, it is customary for each facility to operate it's cells in 
such a manner as to obtain maximum fiscal economy, taking all plant expenses 
into consideration. Therefore, it is not possible to set forth exact 
operating data for chlorate cells and the following table merely contains a 
representative range of characteristics based on the use of graphite anodes.
   As in the case of chlorine cells, chlorate cells must be dismantled at 
the end of the useful life of the anodes for cleaning and anode replacement. 
The absence, of a diaphragm in the chlorate cell makes this repair 
relatively simple.
   It is customary to add several grams per liter of sodium chromate to the 
electrolyte to assist in maintaining pH on the acid side and to reduce 
corrosion effects on the metallic portions of the cell (not usable with 
lead dioxide anodes). In the event that either the cell container or the 
cooling coils are of metal, they are bonded to the cathode to provide 
cathodic protection against corrosion. Fig. 2 is a basic flowsheet for 
sodium chlorate production.

loss of chlorine from the electrolyte. Therefore, the stream being returned 
to the cells from the rundown tank is acidified with chlorine or 
hydrochloric acid using automatic control based on pH.
   The feed to the crystallization system contains hypochlorite ion which 
must be removed by heating, air blowing, and/or acid or thiosulfate 
treatment. The feed is also made slightly alkaline with caustic soda 
following hypochlorite removal. Failure to remove hypochlorite and acid will 
cause serious corrosion problems in the evaporator. The liquor is 
subsequently filtered to remove anode mud and other solids. If required by 
the concentration of chlorate, the purified liquor may then be evaporated in 
continuous, multi-effect evaporators until chlorate just starts to 
precipitate. The liquor is then transferred to either an evaporative or a 
surface cooled crystallizer where crystallisation takes place. In some 
systems "salting out" of chlorate with sodium chloride is employed.
   Crystallizers may operate at temperatures as low as -1OC. The slurry 
from the crystallizer is continuously centrifuged to remove chlorate 
crystals, with the mother liquor being returned to the rundown tank.

   Chlorates are reasonably stable but, since they are very powerful 
oxidizing agents, have a tendency to react strongly with reducing agents.
Accordingly, great care must be taken that all equipment and plant 
facilities are kept clear of wood, oil, combustible organic materials, 
sulfur, ammonium salts, dust, and easily oxidizable metals such as aluminum 
and magnesium. Moving equipment must either be run dry or lubricated with 
water or fluorinated lubricants. Pump packings must be of the noncombustible
type. Chlorate solutions are especially dangerous with respect to materials 
that are both absorbent and oxidizable. Rubber and plastics, although 
organic in nature, may be relatively safe for certain applications provided 
that they do not become impregnated with solution, that they do not exude 
organic materials such as oils and plasticizers, and that their temperature 
is kept well below the ignition point. Good safety practice requires that 
employees in chlorate facilities wear a complete change of clean clothing 
every day and that it be washed after each shift. Clothing should also be 
changed immediately in the event that it is splashed with chlorate solution 
since, when dry, chlorate-saturated fabric becomes violently combustible. 
Rubber shoes should also be worn since leather easily impregnates with 
chlorate solutions and becomes hazardous. Chlorate solution will easily 
creep into small cracks and other interstices in equipment and then form 
crystals. Upon crystallization, expansion occurs which may cause serious 
leaks. Chlorate solutions will also creep and deposit crystals in cell 
vents. Therefore, daily washdowns of plant facilities are advisable.
   Sodium chlorate is employed principally for pulp bleaching (reactant for 
chlorine dioxide generation), as a herbicide, and as an intermediate for 
the production of ammonium perchlorate, the oxidizer for most solid rocket 
propellants. Potassium chlorate is used in matches, flares, and pyrotechnic 
devices.
