<p><a href="us4272354.pdf">US Patent No. 4,272,354</a> describes a Bismuth doped Tin Oxide Anode (Sn0<small>2</small>/Bi<small>2</small>O<small>3</small> or BTO) that is described as <i>useful for Perchlorate production</i>. The patent states (col. 4) that <i>the synergistic effect of the BTO hinders Oxygen evolution</i>. This is very desirable for Perchlorate production. In example III the patent also states that the most useful ratio of Sn to Bi (actual metal) is from 9:1 to 4:1(10% to 20% Bi).<p>
<h4>The Anode</h4>
Example III in the patent used Bismuth Nitrate in the precursor for the BTO. An attempt of the procedure was made but the Titanium was passivated as soon as a coating of precursor was baked. HCl was added to the precursor to see if that would help but it made no difference. The Bismuth Nitrate was abandoned in favour of Bismuth Chloride. <br>
Bismuth Trinitrate Pentahydrate. <br>
Bismuth(III) Nitrate Pentahydrate,
Bi(NO3)3:5H2O [10035-06-0] is obtained by dissolving Bismuth metal, Bi2O3, or
(BiO)2CO3 in Nitric acid. Attempts to remove the water of hydration yield
monoclinic crystals of Bismuthyl Nitrate Hemihydrate, BiONO:1/2H2O [10361-64-3] (41). Addition of Bismuth Trinitrate Pentahydrate to alkali yields a product
termed Bismuth Subnitrate that is widely used in pharmaceuticals. This material
approximates the composition 6Bi2O3:5N2O5:9H2O.
<p>
Patent No. 4222998 describes ways to make Bismuth Chloride that uses Chlorine gas + metal.<br>
Kirk-Othmer states that Bismuth metal will dissolve in Aqua Regia and when evaporated, a hydrated form of Bismuth Chloride is left behind, BiCl3:2H2O. This can be distilled (447&deg;C?) to give  anhydrous BiCl3.<br>
