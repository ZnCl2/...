<h4>Making SnCl<small>4</small>:5H<small>2</small>O</h4>
<ul><li>SnCl<small>4</small> (anhydrous) can be manufactured by applying Chlorine gas to Tin metal. The formed SnCl<small>4</small> (liquid) should be allowed to drip onto the Tin metal in the apparatus. The reaction is exothermic. The Tin metal should be OK if cut into small pieces or powdered.<br>
There is a procedure below for making Anhydrous SnCl<SMALL>4</SMALL><BR><I><PRE>
This is how you make anhydrous SnCl4:

Take a small diameter to height vessel , zylindric so to say where a gasdispersingtube goes to the bottom
 and another from the top out. You can make this with a rubber-stopper with two holes, but wrap the 
 fucking stopper in teflon tape, seriously not just a little bit but 5 to 10 times around. Or the 
 rubber gets eaten and chlorine all over is no fun.

The dispersingtube you hook to your chlorine generator, dry, dried, conc. H2SO4 dried chlorine. 
The outlet you hook to a suckbackpreventervessel and then to a vessel to scrub the chlorine, don´t
 remember what I used then. In the processing flask you fill chloroform or DCM, leave some headspace. 
 Into the chlorinated solvent comes tin. Tin leaves made by simply melting 99% tin solder and let it
 dropping on the floor. Tiles are preferred a carpet might be not so good. Just stuff so much tin in
 that the gas gets more dispersed on its way up but is not blocked.
Add a mini, mini, mini, drop of Mercury. Or a mercury salt. 
Make sure everythings tight, fire up the chlorine generator (you can say a short prayer before if you like to)
 and here we go. <br>
Hg makes for some small amalganation and chlorine eats the tin even in the cold no problem. When almost
 all of the tin is gone - there are some residues, you´ll see - shut the generator down. Clean the lines 
 but seal the flask from the air. Put the flask in the freezer. Put a distillation flask in the freezer.
 Prepare distillation setup. Shortway distillation. Open the colden flask with the SnCl4, hold your breath,
 as HCl fumes evade. Transfer to distillation setup. Distill solvent- Change receiving flask and distill 
 the SnCl4. Your distillation setup must be closed except for a vent equipped with a CaCl2 drying tube 
 yes? After distilling put the SnCl4 in a glas-vessel which fits for the volume and can be hermetically
 sealed, say grounded glass stopper and wrap this with teflon tape. Store in the freezer. 

Everytime you open it you´ll have the tears of success.

I made about 250ml SnCl2 in a afternoon and had only two days problems breathing, so that was good.

The procedure is curtesy of Hyperlab/Antoncho IIRC.

Anhydrous SnCl<small>4</small> will dissolve in cold water ( warm/hot will decompose it).<br>
The SnCl<small>4</small> should be added to a minimum amount of water and this solution saturated  with Chlorine gas. The  solution is then  evaporated and condensed. When this solution is  cooled, deposits of SnCl<small>4</small>:5H<small>2</small>0 will form.  DTO films can be made from SnCl<small>4</small> (anhydrous) without converting to the hydrated form, US Pat. 3627669.<br>


<p><li>Oxidize Stannous Chloride with Chlorine gas. Evaporate on a steam bath or gently  boil directly on a hotplate. If hydrolysis occurs (ppt forming) add tiny amounts of conc. HCl until solution is clear. Evaporate until crystals of SnCl<small>4</small>:5H<SMALL>2</small>O separate when cooled.<br>
<p><li> Stannic Chloride can be made from Tin metal + Aqua Reiga. Dissolve and evoporate.<br>
4HCl + 2HNO3 + Sn ==> SnCl4:5H2O + NO2 + NO + 3H2O <p></ul><p>
A mixture of HCl + H2O2 + Stannous Chloride gives a hydrated SnO2, not Stannic Chloride.<br>
