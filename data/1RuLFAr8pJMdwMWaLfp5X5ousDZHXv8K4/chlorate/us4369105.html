<BR><BR>Also of various degrees of relevancy are U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,073,873; 
3,711,382; 3,711,397; 4,028,215; 4,040,939; 3,706,644; 3,528,857; 3,689,384;

<BR><BR>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION <BR><BR>An insoluble anode for electrolysis, 
especially electrolysis of brine solutions, is prepared by coating an 
electroconductive substrate with a first coating comprising one or more oxides 
of the group of metals consisting of Sn, Pb, Sb, Al, and In, and then an outer 
coating comprising an effective amount of a monometal or polymetal oxide having 
a spinel structure conforming substantially to the empirical formula comprising 
M.sub.x Z.sub.y Co.sub.3-(x+y) O.sub.4, where O.ltoreq.x.ltoreq.1, 
O.ltoreq.y.ltoreq.0.5, O.ltoreq.(x+2y).ltoreq.1, where M represents at least one 
metal of Groups IB, IIA, and IIB of the Periodic Table and where Z represents at 
least one metal of Group IA. The spinel coating optionally contains a modifier 
metal oxide. The coating is prepared by applying a fluid mixture of the metal 
oxide precursors to the substrate and heating under oxidizing conditions at a 
temperature in a range effective to form the first coating and the second 
(spinel) coating in-situ on the substrate. A "polymetal" cobalt spinel is used 
herein to describe a spinel containing a plurality of metals, of which cobalt is 
one. <BR><BR>FIG. 1 illustrates data from only certain embodiments described 
hereinafter . <BR><BR>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <BR><BR>Cobalt oxide based 
anode coatings of the spinel type are sensitive to preparation temperature. 
Anodes prepared at temperatures above 450.degree. C. tend to have high operating 
potentials in service; furthermore, these potentials tend to increase more 
rapidly than those of anodes prepared at lower temperatures. It has unexpectedly 
been found that the anodes of the present invention are more tolerant of high 
preparation temperatures than are those of the prior art. A high temperature 
yields a tougher, more highly sintered active coating, and is thus desirable, if 
low operating potentials can be maintained. <BR><BR>It is believed that the 
cobalt oxide based anode coatings of the spinel type are sufficiently permeable 
to oxygen at elevated temperatures that oxidation of the electroconductive 
substrate (typically a valve metal such as titanium) can take place during the 
coating operation. It is well known that valve metal oxides are poor electrical 
conductors in the anodic direction; thus such high-temperature anodes have 
undesirably high resistances and thus high operating potentials. <BR><BR>It is 
believed that the interface layer of the present invention functions by reacting 
with the valve metal oxide as it is formed on the surface of the substrate, 
rendering it electrically conductive. The mechanism by which this is 
accomplished is uncertain. Trivalent metals such as indium may function as 
conventional semi-conductor dopants in the (tetravalent) valve metal oxide 
lattice; tetravalent metals such as tin may form conductive solid solutions with 
the valve metal oxide, analogous to RuO.sub.2 -TiO.sub.2 solid solutions. 
<BR><BR>One feature that distinguishes the present invention from interface 
layers of platinum group metals and/or oxides is that the interface materials of 
the present invention cannot in themselves form the basis of an operable anode 
coating: tin oxide can be used as a dopant in solid solution anode coatings but 
is insufficiently stable to be used alone, and antimony and indium oxides are 
highly reactive in typical brine electrolysis anolyte. It is thus unexpected 
that their presence in interface layers stabilizes the operation of anodes in 
brine electrolysis. <BR><BR>In general, the first metal oxide coating is 
prepared on a cleaned, oxide-free, electroconductive substrate, such as 
titanium, by applying to the substrate a layer of precursor metal compound 
which, when thermally decomposed in air, yields the oxide of the metal affixed 
in-situ on the substrate. More than one metal oxide precursor may be used 
simultaneously, so long as the precursor compound is at least one thermally 
decomposable compound of Sn, Pb, Sb, Al, In or mixtures of these. The precursor 
may be a metal-organic, or otherwise contain organic moieties, but is preferably 
an inorganic compound. It is preferred that the precursor metal compound be 
carried in a liquid medium, such as water, alcohol, water/alcohol, 
water/acetone, and the like; preferably the precursor metal compound is soluble 
in the liquid medium. During the heating step of the process the liquid carrier 
is boiled away and plays no further part in the process. The steps of applying 
the metal oxide precursors, followed by heating to create the metal oxides, is 
beneficially repeated one or more times, thereby assuring that a contiguous 
well-adhered coating of the metal oxide is obtained, though only one coat is 
operable. It is best if this metal oxide underlayer has a thickness in the range 
of about 20-400 A, coatings as thin as about 10 A demonstrate operability as to 
coatings thicker than 400 A but there are no additional benefits to be derived 
from such thicker coatings which are commensurate with the expense of laying 
down such thicker coatings. The temperature used in forming the metal oxide 
underlayer may be from the decomposition temperature (in air) of the metal oxide 
precursor to as high as several hundred degrees centigrade, preferably a 
temperature in the range of about 200.degree. C. to about 450.degree. C., most 
preferably about 250.degree.-450.degree. C. The baking time is generally in the 
range of about 1.5 to about 60 minutes, the higher temperatures requiring the 
lesser times. Excess time at the higher temperatures can lead to unwanted 
oxidation of the substrate. <BR><BR>In general, the spinel coating is prepared 
in-situ on the so-coated electroconductive substrate by applying a fluid mixture 
(preferably a solution) of the spinel-forming precursors along with, optionally, 
any modifier metal oxide precursors desired, to the coated substrate, then 
heating at a temperature and for a time effective to produce the spinel 
structure as a layer or coating on the pre-coated substrate. The spinel coating 
is found to form a contiguous, well-adhered layer on the undercoating of metal 
oxide applied first. <BR><BR>The temperature effective in producing the spinel 
structure is generally in the range of about 200.degree. C. to about 475.degree. 
C., preferably in the range of about 250.degree. C. to about 400.degree. C. At 
temperatures below about 200.degree. C. the formation of the desired spinel 
structure is likely to be too slow to be feasible and it is likely that 
substantially no spinel will be formed, even over extended periods of time. At 
temperatures above about 475.degree. C. there is likely to be formed other 
cobalt oxide structures, such as cobaltic oxide (Co.sub.2 O.sub.3) and/or 
cobaltous oxide (CoO), whether substituted or not. Any heating of the spinel 
above about 450.degree. C. should be of short duration, say, not more than about 
5 minutes, to avoid altering the desired spinel structures to other forms of the 
metal oxides. Any modifier metal oxides present, being contained in the spinel 
structure as a different phase, will be formed quite well at the spinel-forming 
temperatures and any variations in the oxide form of the modifier metal oxides 
are not significant in the present invention. By using the undercoat prescribed 
in the present invention, the preferred temperature range for formation of the 
spinel topcoat becomes about 400.degree. C.-450.degree. C., most preferably 
about 400.degree. C.-425.degree. C. <BR><BR>The length of time at which the 
heating is done to form the spinel structure is, generally, inversely related to 
the temperature. At lower temperatures within the prescribed range, the time may 
be as much as 8 hours or more without destroying the spinel structure or 
converting substantial amounts of it to other oxide forms. At the upper end of 
the prescribed heating range, the time of heating should not be extended beyond 
the time needed to form the desired spinel structure because extended heating 
times may destroy or convert a substantial amount of the spinel to other oxide 
forms; at the upper end of the range a heating time in the range of about 1 
minutes to about 5 minutes is generally satisfactory in forming the spinel 
without forming other oxide forms. <BR><BR>The substrates of interest in the 
present invention are electroconductive metals comprising the valve metals or 
film-forming metals which includes titanium, tantalum, zirconium, molybdenum, 
niobium, tungsten, hafnium, and vanadium or alloys thereof. Titanium is 
especially preferred as a substrate for preparing anodes to be used in 
electrolysis of brine. <BR><BR>The precursor cobalt compounds used in making the 
present spinel structures may be any thermally-decomposable oxidizable compound 
which, when heated in the prescribed range, will form an oxide of cobalt. The 
compound may be organic, such as cobalt octoate or cobalt 2-ethyl hexanoate and 
the like, but is preferably an inorganic compound, such as cobalt nitrate, 
cobalt hydroxide, cobalt carbonate, and the like. Cobalt nitrate is especially 
preferred. <BR><BR>The precursor metal compounds of Groups IA, IB, IIA, and IIB 
and of the modifier metal oxides (if used) may be any thermally-decomposable 
oxidizable compound which, when heated in the prescribed range, will form 
oxides. Organic metal compounds may be used, but inorganic metal compounds are 
generally preferred. <BR><BR>Modifier oxides may be incorporated into the 
substituted or unsubstituted Co.sub.3 O.sub.4 coating to provide a tougher 
coating. The modifier oxide is selected from among the following listed groups: 
<BR><BR>Group III-B (Scandium, Yttrium) <BR><BR>Group IV-B (Titanium, Zirconium, 
Hafnium) <BR><BR>Group V-B (Vanadium, Niobium, Tantalum) <BR><BR>Group VI-B 
(Chromium, Molybdenum, Tungsten) <BR><BR>Group VII-B (Manganese, Technetium, 
Rhenium) <BR><BR>Lanthanides (Lanthanum through Lutetium) <BR><BR>Actinides 
(Actinium through Uranium) <BR><BR>Group III-A Metals (Aluminum, Gallium, 
Indium, Thallium) <BR><BR>Group IV-A Metals (Germanium, Tin, Lead) <BR><BR>Group 
V-A Metals (Antimony, Bismuth). <BR><BR>The modifier oxide is, preferably, an 
oxide of cerium, bismuth, lead, vanadium, zirconium, tantalum, niobium, 
molybdenum, chromium, tin, aluminum, antimony, titanium, or tungsten. Mixtures 
of modifier oxides may also be used. <BR><BR>Most preferably, the modifier oxide 
is selected from the group consisting of zirconium, vanadium, and lead, or 
mixtures of these, with zirconium being the most preferable of these. 
<BR><BR>The amount of modifier oxide metal or metals may be in the range of zero 
to about 50 mole %, most preferably about 5 to about 20 mole % of the total 
metal of the coating deposited on the electroconductive substrate. Percentages, 
as expressed, represent mole percent of metal, as metal, in the total metal 
content of the coating. The modifier oxide is conveniently prepared along with 
the substituted or unsubstituted Co.sub.3 O.sub.4 from thermally decomposable 
oxidizable metal compounds, which may be inorganic metal compounds or organic 
metal compounds. <BR><BR>The carrier for the precursor metal compounds is 
preferably water, a mixture of water/acetone, or a mixture of water and a 
water-miscible alcohol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, or isopropanol. The 
carrier is one which readily evaporates during spinel formation. The precursor 
metal compounds are preferably soluble in the carrier or at least in very 
finely-divided form in the carrier. Solubilizing agents may be added to the 
mixture, such as ethers, aldehydes, ketones, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfoxide, 
and the like. In some instances, adjustments to the pH of the mixture may be 
made to enhance the solubility of the metal compounds, but attention should be 
given to whether or not the pH adjuster (acid or base) will add any unwanted 
metal ions. Ammonia is generally the best alkalizer since it does not add metal 
ions. <BR><BR>The procedure for preparing the coatings comprises starting with a 
clean substrate with surface oxides and contaminants substantially removed, at 
least on the surface(s) to be coated, then applying the interface coating as 
described above. The mixture of metal oxide spinel precursors in a liquid 
carrier is applied to the substrate, such as by dipping, spraying, brushing, 
painting, or spreading. The so-coated substrate is subjected to a temperature in 
the prescribed range for a period of time to thermally oxidize the metal 
compounds to oxides, thereby forming, on the interface coating, the spinels of 
the present invention, along with any modifier metal oxides or second-phase 
metal oxides which may be co-prepared but which are not part of the expanded 
cobalt oxide spinel crystal structure. Generally, the first such application 
(which usually gives a relatively thin layer) is done quickly to avoid the risk 
of excessive oxidation of the substrate itself. Then as additional applications 
are made (i.e., applications of the precursor liquid carrier containing the 
metal compounds, followed by thermal oxidation) the thickness of the coating 
builds up, becomes tighter and denser, and there is a substantially reduced risk 
of excessively oxidizing the substrate under the interface coating and the 
spinel coating. Each subsequent layer is found to combine quite readily to 
preceding layers and a contiguous spinel coating is formed which is adhered 
quite well to the interface on the substrate. It is preferred that at least 3 
such layer-applications are employed, especially from about 6 to about 12 such 
layer-applications. <BR><BR>It is best to charge the initial mixture of metal 
compounds into the liquid carrier in such a way that the desired ratio of metals 
are present on a molar basis to satisfy the stoichiometry of the desired 
polymetal cobalt spinel, also referred to herein as expanded cobalt spinel or 
substituted cobalt spinel. <BR><BR>The following enumerated paragraphs are 
presented to offer a simplified explanation, based on belief and experience, of 
what transpires when one or more monovalent or divalent metal ions replace a 
portion of the cobalt ions in a cobalt oxide spinel, but the invention is not 
meant to be limited by, or confined to, this simplified explanation. This 
explanation is intended to cover metals of Groups IA, IIA, IB, and IIB insofar 
as replacement of cobalt ions in a cobalt oxide spinel structure is concerned. 
<BR><BR>1. A "single-metal" cobalt oxide spinel, Co.sub.3 O.sub.4, is understood 
as having, per molecule, one Co.sup.++ ion and two Co.sup.+++ ions to satisfy 
the valence requirements of four O.sup.-- ions; thus the single metal cobalt 
spinel may be illustrated by the emprical formula Co.sup.++ Co.sub.2.sup.+++ 
O.sub.4.sup.-- to show the stoichiometric valence balance of cobalt cations with 
oxygen anions. <BR><BR>2. When divalent metal ions are substituted into the 
cobalt oxide spinel structure, they tend to replace divalent cobalt ions. For 
example when Mg.sup.++ is substituted into the Co.sub.3 O.sub.4 spinel 
structure, it replaces Co.sup.++ giving a spinel illustrated by the empirical 
formula Mg.sup.++ Co.sub.2.sup.+++ O.sub.4.sup.--. <BR><BR>3. When monovalent 
metal ions are substituted into the cobalt oxide spinel structure they tend to 
replace divalent cobalt ions. The maximum monovalent ion substitution may be 
illustrated as, for example, Li.sub.0.5.sup.+ Co.sub.2.5.sup.+++ O.sub.4, to 
show stoichiometric valence balance. The empirical formula may be illustrated 
as, for example, Li.sub.y Co.sub.3-y O.sub.4, where y is not more than 0.5, 3-y 
is at least 2.5, and where (y times Li valence) plus (3-y times cobalt valence) 
equals 8. <BR><BR>4. When two or more divalent metal ions are substituted into 
the cobalt oxide spinel structure, then the structure can be written, 
empirically, as M.sub.x M'.sub.x' Co.sub.3-(x+x') O.sub.4 or as, e.g., M.sub.x 
M'.sub.x' M".sub.x" Co.sub.3-(x+x'+M") O.sub.4. <BR><BR>5. When two or more 
monovalent metal ions are substituted into the cobalt oxide structure, then the 
structure can be written, empirically, as Z.sub.y Z'.sub.y' Co.sub.3-(y+y') 
O.sub.4 or as, e.g., Z.sub.y Z'.sub.y' Z".sub.y" Co.sub.3-(y+y'+y") O.sub.4. 
<BR><BR>6. When at least one monovalent metal ion and at least one divalent ion 
are substituted into the cobalt oxide spinel structure, then the structure can 
be written, empirically, as M.sub.x Z.sub.y Co.sub.3-(x+y) O.sub.4 or as, e.g., 
M.sub.x M'.sub.x' Z.sub.y Co.sub.3-(x+x'+y) O.sub.4 or, e.g., as M.sub.x 
M'.sub.x' Z.sub.y Z'.sub.y' Co.sub.3-(x+x'+y+y') O.sub.4. <BR><BR>7. If an 
excess of monovalent and/or divalent metal ions are present in the mixture from 
which the substituted cobalt oxide structures are prepared, the excess metal 
values tend to form a separate metal oxide phase which is not a spinel structure 
but which is present with the spinel structure. <BR><BR>8. It will be understood 
by practitioners of these arts that there may be some degree of imperfect spinel 
crystals which, if they could be isolated and measured separately may not 
conform exactly to the empirical structures written in this disclosure, but the 
spinel products prepared according to this invention can be said to conform 
substantially to the empirical formulae shown. <BR><BR>9. If metal values are in 
the mixture (from which the spinel structures are formed) which do not 
effectively replace cobalt ions in the cobalt oxide spinel structure, these 
metals tend to form separate metal oxide phases which act as modifiers of the 
spinel structures. For instance, where the spinel structures are formed by 
building up a contiguous layer of the spinel on a substrate by repeated 
applications of spinel-forming ingredients, each application being followed by 
the heating step, the modifier metal oxides are beneficial in providing 
toughness and abrasion-resistance to the layer. The amount of modifier metal 
oxides should be limited so that the desired spinel is the predominant 
ingredient of the coating. <BR><BR>The metals of the relevant groups of the 
Periodic Table are as follows: <BR><BR>______________________________________ IA 
IIA IB IIB ______________________________________ Li Be Cu Zn Na Mg Ag Cd K Ca 
Au Hg Rb Sr Cs Ba Fr Ra ______________________________________ <BR><BR>Operative 
upper limits for molar percentage of the M and Z metals which form polymetal 
spinels with cobalt are, based on total metal content of the spinel: 
M.ltoreq.33.3%, Z.ltoreq.16.7%, and M+Z.ltoreq.33.3%. Any excess of M and Z will 
form a separate phase of the metal oxide amongst the spinel crystals. When M 
metals are used in the coating, it is preferred that on a molar metal basis M is 
at least 8%. When Z metals are used in the coating, it is preferred that on a 
molar metal basis Z is at least 4%. <BR><BR>The following examples are to 
illustrate the invention, but the invention is not limited to the particular 
embodiments shown. <BR><BR>Experimental <BR><BR>The type of test cell utilized 
here was a conventional vertical diaphragm chlorine cell. The diaphragm was 
deposited from an asbestos slurry onto a foraminous steel cathode in the 
conventional manner. Anode and cathode were each approximately 3".times.3" (7.62 
cm.times.7.62 cm). Current was brought to the electrodes by a brass rod brazed 
to the cathode and a titanium rod welded to the anode. The distance from the 
anode to the diaphragm face was approximately 1/4 inch (0.635 cm). Temperature 
of the cell was controlled by means of a thermocouple and heater placed in the 
anolyte compartment. A 300 gpl sodium chloride solution was fed continuously to 
the anolyte compartment via a constant overflow system. Chlorine, hydrogen, and 
sodium hydroxide were withdrawn continuously from the cell. Anolyte and 
catholyte levels were adjusted to maintain an NaOH concentration in the 
catholyte of about 110 gpl. Power was supplied to the cell by a 
current-regulated power supply. Electrolysis was conducted at an apparent 
current density of 0.5 ampere per square inch (6.45 cm.sup.2) anode area. 
<BR><BR>The etching solution employed in the examples below was prepared by 
mixing 25 ml analytical reagent hydrofluoric acid (48% HF by weight), 175 ml 
analytical reagent nitric acid (approximately 70% HNO.sub.3 by weight), and 300 
ml deionized H.sub.2 O. <BR><BR>Anode potentials were measured in a laboratory 
cell specifically designed to facilitate measurements on 3".times.3" 
(7.62.times.7.62 cm) anodes. The cell is constructed of plastic. Anode and 
cathode compartments are separated by a commercial PTFE membrane. The anode 
compartment contains a heater, a thermocouple, a thermometer, a stirrer, and a 
Luggin capillary probe which is connected to a saturated calomel reference 
electrode located outside the cell. The cell is covered to minimize evaporative 
losses. Electrolyte is 300 gpl sodium chloride brine solution. Potentials are 
measured with respect to saturated calomel at ambient temperature 
(25.degree.-30.degree. C.). Lower potentials imply a lower power requirement per 
unit of chlorine produced, and thus more economical operation. <BR><BR>EXAMPLE I 
<BR><BR>Fifteen pieces of ASTM Grade I titanium expanded mesh approximately 
3".times.3".times.0.063" (7.62.times.7.62.times.0.16 cm) were dipped in 
1,1,1-trichloroethane, air dried, dipped in HF-HNO.sub.3 etching solution 
approximately 30 seconds, rinsed with deionized water, and air dried. The mesh 
was blasted with Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 grit to a uniform rough surface and blown 
clean with air. Two interface coating precursor solutions were prepared as 
follows: Solution (A) contained 15.1 g of SnCl.sub.4.5H.sub.2 O dissolved in 5 
ml concentrated reagent HCl and 30 ml technical isopropyl alcohol; Solution (B) 
contained 2.03 g SbCl.sub.3 and 15.1 g SnCl.sub.4.5H.sub.2 O dissolved in 5 ml 
concentrated reagent HCl and 30 ml technical isopropyl alcohol. The active 
spinel coating precursor, Solution (C), was prepared by mixing appropriate 
quantities of Co(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O, Zn(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O, 
aqueous ZrO(NO.sub.3).sub.2 solution and deionized H.sub.2 O to give a mole 
ratio of 10 Co:5 Zn:1 Zr. <BR><BR>Five sets of anodes were prepared, each 
containing three samples. Sample (a) of each set contained no interface coating, 
and thus serves as a comparative example. Sample (b) contains an interface 
coating of tin oxide obtained from Solution (A). Sample (c) contains an 
interface coating of tin and antimony oxides obtained from Solution (B). 
<BR><BR>All interface coatings were prepared at 450.degree. C. For all samples 
(b) and (c) the specimens were brushed with the appropriate interface solution, 
baked in a 450.degree. C. convection oven for about ten minutes, removed and 
cooled in air about ten minutes. One additonal interface coat was applied in a 
similar manner. For sets (1) and (2) Sample (a) was given two coats of active 
spinel at 450.degree. C. while Samples (b) and (c) were being given their two 
interface coats. <BR><BR>All fifteen anodes were given eight coats of active 
spinel in the following manner: the substances treated as described above were 
brushed with solution (C), placed in a convection oven heated to the temperature 
listed in Table I below, baked for about ten minutes, removed, and cooled in air 
about ten minutes. Seven additional coats were applied in a similar manner. 
After all coats were applied and baked, the anodes were given a final bake at 
375.degree. C. for about one hour. <BR><BR>Potentials of the fifteen anodes were 
measured in the laboratory cell described above. The cell was heated to about 
70.degree. C. and electrolysis was conducted at an apparent current density of 
0.5 ampere per square inch (6.45 cm.sup.2) anode area. Results are shown in 
Table I and FIG. 1. It is apparent that the anodes of the present invention are 
much less sensitive to preparation temperature than are those of the comparative 
example. <BR><BR>TABLE I ______________________________________ Bake Temperature

of ASTM Grade 1 titanium expanded mesh approximately 3".times.3".times.0.063" 
(7.62.times.7.62.times.0.16 cm) was dipped in 1,1,1-trichloroethane, air dried, 
dipped in HF-HNO.sub.3 etching solution approximately 30 seconds, rinsed with 
deionized water, and air dried. The mesh was blasted with Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 grit 
to a uniform rough surface and blown clean with air. An interface coating 
precursor solution was prepared as follows: 1.30 g of InCl.sub.3.4H.sub.2 O and 
0.009 g SbCl.sub.3 were dissolved in 3.2 g concentrated reagent HCl and 20.5 g 
technical isopropyl alcohol. An active spinel coating precursor, Solution (C), 
was prepared by mixing appropriate quantities of Co(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O, 
Zn(NO.sub.3).sub.2.6H.sub.2 O, aqueous ZrO(NO.sub.3).sub.2 solution, and 
deionized H.sub.2 O to give a mole ratio of 10 Co:5 Zn:1 Zr. <BR><BR>The 
specimen was brushed with the interface solution, baked in a 400.degree. C. 
convection oven for about ten minutes, removed, and cooled in air about ten 
minutes. The specimen was then given twelve coats of spinel. Each coat was 
applied by brushing with spinel coating precursor, baking at 400.degree. C. ten 
minutes, removed from the oven, and cooling in air about ten minutes. After the 
twelfth spinel coat had been baked the anode was given a final bake at 
375.degree. C. for about one hour. <BR><BR>The anode was placed in a diaphragm 
chlorine cell as described above and operated for over 1.5 years. The cell was 
shut down from time-to-time for measurement of the anode potential in the 
laboratory cell, also described above. The potential of the anode at 0.5 ampere 
per square inch (6.45 cm.sup.2) apparent current density and 70.degree. C., 
measured versus saturated calomel at 30.degree. C., was 1082 mv prior to 
start-up, 1104 mv after 0.15 yr. operation, and 1093 mv after 1.5 yr. operation. 
It thus demonstrated stable operation in long-term service as a chlorine anode.
