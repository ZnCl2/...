<P><BR>
How long to run a cell can be a difficult question to answer. <br>
It will depend on the amount of NaCl that
 you started off with, how low you want to decrease the Chloride concentration to (Anode wear considerations), the current entering the cell and  the current efficiency (CE). <br>
 The current 
 efficiency achieved in Industrial plant (with pH control) is in the region of 95%. For the Amateur it will be less as  pH control is  not usually performed 
With Platinum, Graphite, MMO and MnO<small>2</small>  
 45% to 55% for a typical set up without pH control will be achieved, assuming you are not running your cell to a low Chloride 
 concentration, say 60g/l or less. MnO2 gives poor CE in Na cells. Magnetite needs pH control for to achieve sensible CE.<br>
With MMO good efficiency's are achieved even when the cell is let run to low (40g/l) Chloride levels.
With Lead Dioxide low CE's without pH control are obtained. </P>

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>Small lesson on electricity</P>
</B></FONT><P>The way the Chlorate maker should look at electricity that enters the cell is in terms of the
 total number of electrons that has entered the cell over a period of time (that's the total charge, that
 has entered the cell). Amps are the RATE of flow of charge. (like gallons per second is to water).There
 are a number of different units that are used to describe the number of electrons (charge). (This is
 similar to the fact that there are a number of different ways to describe, for example, length, the 
 Meter, Mile, Foot, Yard, etc )</P>
<P>The Coulomb, (C) [pronounced cool-em]<BR>
The Ampere hour,(Ah)<BR>
The Ampere minute, (Am)<BR>
Ampere seconds, (As)<BR>
The Faraday, (Named after Michael Faraday) = One mole of electrons.<BR>
See <A HREF="whatmole.html"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">What is a mole</U></FONT></A><BR>
All the above units are equivalent and are related thus:</P>
<TABLE BGCOLOR=YELLOW>
<TR><TD>
<P>One mole of electrons = 1 Faraday = 26.802Ah (Ampere hours) = 1608Am = 96487As = 96487 Coulomb's
= 6.02 X 10<sup>23</sup> Electrons
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>


<P>The units we usually work in are Ampere hours (or sometimes moles of electrons).<BR>
When our cell is converting Chloride into Chlorate at 100% current efficiency it means that every six 
mole's of electrons that enters our cell is used to convert one mole of NaCl into one mole of NaClO3. 
It takes six electrons to 'stick' the three Oxygen atoms onto the Chloride.<BR>
When Charge is flowing at a rate of one Coulomb per second this is called one Amp. As stated above the Amp 
is the RATE of flow of Charge. The length of time needed for a current of one Amp to shift one mole of 
Electrons is 26.802 Hours.<br>Their are 58.443 grams  NaCl (74.55g KCl) in one mole.</P>

<P>The following table is taken from Mike Browns page and shows the time for a 
<A HREF="runtable.html"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Sodium Chlorate cell running at 100% current efficiency, 
to convert all of the Chloride in the cell to Chlorate.</U></FONT></A><BR>

If you run your cell for the amount of time in the (100% efficiency) run time table you will get 
somewhere between 45% and 55% of the NaCl turned into Chlorate for a cell that is not pH controlled. 
That is what 
we call 45 to 55% current efficiency. The other 45 to 55% of the electrons are 'lost' to other processes 
in the cell. </P>
<P>When your cell is working, some water is used up in the reactions and some will evaporate. 
This volume loss will have to be replaced or the cell contents will get small in volume and leave
 your Anode and Cathode not immersed as far as you would like. You can either add water or salt solution.
 If you want to separate Sodium Chlorate out of your cell as solid product then it is essential to keep topping
 up your cell with NaCl solution. You will have a high concentration of Sodium Chlorate in your electrolyte
 when you are finished which will give you some solid Chlorate ppt.<br>
 Know what the concentration of the top up solution is and keep a note of how much
 you add.<br>

 If you have a lid on the cell there will be little evaporation and therefor no room for adding salt solution. <br>
If you run your cell with no lid, a Salt/Chlorate mist will descend on everything around the cell. The mist gets created by the bubbles of Hydrogen leaving
the cell.  It may be necessary to operate the cell outside or better to have some sort of cover that will allow evaporation but trap the dreaded mist.</P>

<P>So, to get back to the original question: How long should I run my cell for?</TD>

</TABLE>


<P><BR>
It depends on what you are doing. You will also have to take into consideration what type of Anode you are using, ie. if using Graphite the salt concentration
should not be let fall low or excessive erosion will occur.  If  Sodium Perchlorate is the target, with no separation of 
intermediate Chlorate,(not recommended BTW) then you will be letting the cell run for a long time and it is difficult to give a figure off hand, see the 'Sodium Perchlorate' 
section.<BR> If you are making KClO3 by adding KCl, things are not very critical and you can let it
 run for the amount of time in the<BR>
<A HREF="table54.html"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Sodium Chlorate cell run time calculation.</U></FONT></A>
 This formula will give you the practical run times for a cell that is working at various efficiencies. 
The formula 
 insures that there will be about 100g/l of NaCl in the cell that is unconverted to Chlorate at the end 
 of the run. This is OK, as it means that you will have gotten sensible current efficiencies throughout
 the run of the cell because you have not run your cell to very low Chloride concentrations where you 
 would have gotten ridiculously low current efficiencies. It also means that you will not have eroded 
 you Anodes excessively, especially Graphite.<BR>
You then add KCl, filter and start again.  
 There will be 100g/l of Sodium Chloride left in the cell when you use the run times given by the formula.
 That’s why the cell volume is included in the formula.</P>
<P>For the person who wants to separate out solid Sodium Chlorate from the cell you should run your cell
 for the amount of time in the<BR>
<A HREF="table54.html"><U><FONT COLOR="#0000ff">Sodium Chlorate cell run time calculation.</U></FONT></A>
 (same as above)<BR>
Include the NaCl that was added when topping up the cell in the run time calculation.<p>
When removing product from the cell by crystallization, the appropriate  mutual solubility diagram should be consulted. An
explanation of how to interpret 
 mutual solubility diagrams is in <A HREF="mut_sol.zip">here</A>.<br>
 Another useful document is in <A HREF="b_fitch.pdf">How to Design Fractional Crystallization Processes</A><br>
Also the book "Aqueous Solutions and the Phase  Diagram" by FREDERICK FIELD PURDON
and VICTOR WALLACE SLATER,  is very useful reading.  It is available in Google Books.<br><p>
From Swede: <br>If you know the  amount of dry (and anhydrous) solid product you have produced in grams from a run you can calculate the CE using the following simple formula:<br><p>
<table Border><tr><td>Process</td><td>Formula for CE in %</tr><tr><td></tr>
<tr><td>Na Chloride to Chlorate</td><td>151.08 * Weight/Ah</tr>
<tr><td>Na Chlorate to Perchlorate</td><td>43.78 * Weight/Ah</tr>
<tr><td>K Chloride to Chlorate</td><td>131.22 * Weight/Ah</tr>
<tr><td>K Chlorate to Perchlorate</td><td>38.69 * Weight/Ah</tr>
<tr><td>Na Chloride to Perchlorate</td><td>175.10 * Weight/Ah</tr></table><br>
<br><p>
Note that the amount of Amper Hours required per mole of Li, Na and K are the same per mole of starting salt. The amount of Amper Hours required per mole of Mg, Ca, Sr and Ba are double what it takes per mole as these elements are in col. 2 of the periodic table (see formula of their Chlorates and Perchlorates).<br><p>
For Perchlorate cell runtimes see the 'Sodium Perchlorate' section.<br><p>
