The Cathode has a relatively non demanding job to do in the Chlorate or Perchlorate cell. The reactions that must happen at the Cathode occur easily and most metals are 
protected by the fact that they are connected to the minus of the supply, (Cathodically protected).<br>
 Two unwanted reactions that happens at the Cathode in  the Chlorate
cell are Hypochlorite and to a lesser extent Chlorate being reduced ie.converted back into Chloride. This is undesirable as it  wastes  current by destroying the wanted products. Keeping the current density high on the 
Cathode will decrease the amount of Cathodic reduction of Hypochlorite, therefor Cathodes of excessively large surface area should not be used. (Ullman,  page 24 & 9) Use similar surface area to Anode or smaller and cover the backs of the Cathodes with a nonconductor. Using smooth surfaced material helps reduce actual surface area.  This does not apply when making Alkali Earth metal Chlorates and Perchlorates as Cathodes in those cases must be kept large to stop Hydroxides from precipitating onto them. <a href="cat_size.html">See this link for the result of using a very large Cathode in a Sodium Chlorate cell</a>.<br>
Using Titanium metal stops the reduction of Chlorate unlike Iron which reduces Chlorate. Chromates added to the cell also stop Cathodic reduction as do Yttrium(III)  compounds. Fluorides and Persulphates  also.<br>
 Transition metal ions are  responsible for the catalytic reduction of Hypochlorite in the bulk of the cell solution in a Chlorate cell. Therefor it is best to avoid Nickel,  Copper, Zinc, Cobalt, etc as a Cathode material.<br >
Keep the current density on the 'working' side (the side of the Cathode next to the Anode) at approx. 60mA per square cm or more especially in 'green' cells. Use perforated material or if using large flat sheet Cathodes it would be best to cover the sides away from the Anode with nonconductor. This will help to stop reduction of Hypochlorite back to Chloride at the Cathode surface.<p>

    <TD>Titanium</TD>
    <TD>This is a good  Cathode material if you can get it. It won't corrode 
      and contaminate the product. The metal and it's hydrides have 
      electro catalytic effect similar to Mild Steel for the evolution of Hydrogen. It also has the advantage of not reducing Chlorate. 
It lasts about 2 years in 
commercial cells with Hydrogen embrittlement ending its life. Use Grade 1, 2, 3 or 4. The Grades containing Al are inclined to warp especially at high temperatures. There are reports of thin sheets of Grade one Ti becoming brittle and breaking soon after they are installed in a cell. Use sheets that are at least 1mm thick.

    <TD>Stainless steel</TD>
    <TD>There are many types of stainless steel.<BR>Food grade works good, 
      some of the other grades will corrode a small amount and give your 
      solution a yellow colour. The yellow colour is colloidal Iron and Chromium. 
      The Chromium is bad news when you are using a Lead Dioxide Anode as it 
      forms a thin layer on the Anode and reduces the current 
      efficiency. Try and use a grade that will not corrode at all. Protect exposed 
      surfaces of the SS at the top of the electrolyte using plastic or such 
      like as most of the corrosion (when cell is running) takes place above the liquid line.
     Don't leave the Cathodes in the electrolyte with the power switched 
      off, remove and wash them.<BR>Just about any grade of SS will do the job. Grades of SS that 
	  would be best are type 347, 316 and food grade SS, Durimet 20, Hastelloy HB-1, 
      Hastelloy HC-3, Hastelloy C. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Mild steel</TD>
    <TD>This is cheap but it will corrode if you don't have Chromate in the 
      electrolyte to help protect it. You can't use chromate's if you are using 
      Lead Dioxide Anodes and as Chromate's will lower current efficiency. Some 
      of the Cathode will have to come up above the solution level so as to get 
      a connection to it. This part should be protected with a plastic sleeve or 
      something similar to stop it corroding in all cells, Chromate's or not. The 
      corrosion products are not detrimental to the Chlorate product but you may 
      have a yellow colour (colloidal Iron) that need extra work to get rid of. 
      You must not leave the Steel in the cell if it is turned off or it will 
      corrode even more. According to JES Vol.105. No.3 (1958) [bottom of last 
      page] using mild steel drastically reduces current efficiency?. It has 
      been used in industry. </TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Copper</TD>
    <TD>Copper is OK if you are going to use your Chlorate for bleaching! For 
      all other uses of Chlorate it should be ruled out completely. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Nickel</TD>
    <TD>Nickel can be used as a  cathode if you can get it but it will corrode if 
      you don't have Chromate's in the electrolyte for to protect it. It leaves a black mess in the Chlorate cell. It has been 
      used in Perchlorate production. You can't use Chromate's with Lead Dioxide 
      as the current efficiency will be lowered. You may be able to get Nickel 
      welding rods as a free sample from your welding supply store. In a report from a home producer of Perchlorate,
     Nickel welding rods when used in a cell that went all
     the way from Chloride to Perchlorate suffered corrosion. <br>
      Don't leave in a cell that is not operational. Since it is a transition metal, it's ions
      will help to reduce Hypochlorite in the solution bulk of a Chlorate cell which is undesirable. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Graphite</TD>
    <TD>Graphite can be used for a Cathode but will blacken your product a 
      small amount in the long run. Leaving them sitting in a cell when it is 
      turned off causes it to erode somewhat and they shred a bit when the 
      current is turned back on. Take them out of 
      the cell when they are not in use and give them a wash. Graphite does not reduce Chlorate back to Chloride (DSA Thesis). <br>
	  Graphite rods are 
      available as gouging rods from the welding supply store. Remove the Copper 
      coating (if they have any) by peeling. Then run the rod in a cell as an Anode for a 
      short period and dump contents. This gets rid of all Copper that may have been  on the rods after peeling.

 <TR>
    <TD>Lead metal </TD>
    <TD>Lead has never been used in industrial setup's but would make an easily fabricated Cathode. It's tendency to reduce Hypochlorite and Chlorate back to Chloride is unknown. 
      <P></P></TD></TR>

  <TR>
    <TD>Lead Dioxide</TD>
    <TD>Lead Dioxide should NEVER be used as a Cathode as it will dissolve in 
      a short space of time 
      <P></P></TD></TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Platinum</TD>
    <TD>Do not use Platinum as a Cathode. A Pt coated Niobium Cathode crumbled after approx. 150 hours of operation (H<small>2</small> embrittlement of Niobium?). Thanks to "ytmachx" (YouTube) for that information.
