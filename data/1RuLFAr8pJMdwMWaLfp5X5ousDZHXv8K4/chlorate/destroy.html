<h2 align=center> Destroying Chlorate with chemicals</h2>


When making Perchlorates from Sodium Perchlorate you must have pure Perchlorate. The only sensible and feasable way to purify Sodium Perchlorate from Chlorate contamination is to destroy all traces of Chlorate by chemical treatement.
When 'raw' Sodium Perchlorate is removed from  cell liquor it will be contaminated with some Chlorate. There must not be too much Chlorate in the product or it will be wasteful and foolish to attempt to destroy a large amount of Chlorate by chemicals. <br>
The Perchlorate should be dried and weighed and then re dissolved so you can then destroy all traces of Chlorate before going on to make other  Perchlorates.<br>
If you have a solution of Perchlorate that has been obtained by letting your cell run for long enough to convert nearly all of the Chlorate to Perchlorate then you can proceed with the destruction of the Chlorate without crystallising out the Perchlorate.  The absence of Chlorates should be checked for by using a sensitive test for Chlorate after the destruction step has been completed. See 
<a href="tests.html">Tests for Chlorate and Perchlorate.</a><br> 
 There should be NO Chlorate. A Perchlorate that contains ANY Chlorate must be treated as if it WAS Chlorate in regard to dangerous combinations with combustibles, like for example Sulphur.
You also have the extra problem of Chlorate contamination if you are going to make Ammonium Perchlorate, you don't want any Ammonium Chlorate forming. <p>
Note: Sulphite can be spelt either as said or as Sulfite.<br>
Sulphate can be spelt either as said or Sulfate.<p>
See <a href="bis_sul.html">here</a> for a detailed description of Chlorate removal from Potassium Perchlorate by Swede.<p><br>

All the chemicals below work by reducing the Chlorate ion. The Sulphites have the same reducing power in dilute acidified solutions as Sulphur Dioxide. All the Sulphite and Sulphur Dioxide reactions take place in a similar manner. You can test for the presence of Chlorate in your product as per <a href="so2pat.html"> US Patent No. 2,392,769 </a><br> Use K compounds if you need to keep Na out of your final product. <p>
<h2>Sodium Metabisulphite</h2>
The solution should first be acidified to pH 3 or so using Sulphuric or HCl acid, the Sulphite added and the solution  heated strongly or  boiled<p>

The Sodium Metabisulphite reactions take place according to:<P>



First, the Metabisulphite dissociates:<P> 

Na<SMALL>2</SMALL>S<SMALL>2</SMALL>O<SMALL>5</SMALL> + H<SMALL>2</SMALL>O <---->
 2Na<sup>+</sup> + 2H<sup>+</sup> +  2SO<SMALL>3</SMALL><sup>2-</sup><BR>

The Sulphite then reacts with Chlorate:<P>

3SO<SMALL>3</SMALL><sup>2- </sup>+ ClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> <sup>-</sup> => 3SO<SMALL>4</SMALL><sup>2- </sup> + Cl<sup>-</sup><BR>

The overall reaction is:<P>

3Na<SMALL>2</SMALL>S<SMALL>2</SMALL>O<SMALL>5</SMALL> + H<SMALL>2</SMALL>O + 2NaClO<SMALL>3</SMALL> => 3Na<SMALL>2</SMALL>SO<SMALL>4</SMALL> + 3H<SMALL>2</SMALL>SO<SMALL>4</SMALL> + 2NaCl<br>
There is more info. <a href="dissoc_2.jpg">here</a> on dissociations.<p>


You can then neutralise the solution using Sodium Hydroxide which will give you more Sodium Sulphate and water.<br>
H<SMALL>2</SMALL>SO<SMALL>4</SMALL> + 2NaOH ==> Na<SMALL>2</SMALL>SO<SMALL>4</SMALL> + 2H<SMALL>2</SMALL>O
<p>
2.68 grams of Bisulphite is required per gram Sodium Chlorate for complete destruction to occur.<p>
<h2>Sodium Bisulphite</h2>
Similar to Metabisulphite<p>

<h2>Sodium Sulphite</h2>
Similar to Bisulphite<p>
<h2> Sodium Disulfite</h2>
Similar to Bisulphite<p>
<h2>Sulphur Dioxide</h2>
See <a href="so2pat.html">US Patent No. 2,392,769</a><br>  
The chemical equation would be: <br>
SO<small>2</small> + H<small>2</small>O ===> 3H<small>2</small>SO<small>3</small> + ClO<small>3</small><sup> -</sup> ===> Cl<sup>-</sup>  + 3SO<small>4</small><sup>2-</sup><br>
Sulphur Dioxide gas is much more soluble in cold water that hot water so it is best to keep the Perchlorate solution cool to absorbe the SO2.<br>
Sulfur dioxide gas can be generated by a number of means including adding HCl to Sodium Bisulfite and gently heating.<br>
A way to make SO<SMALL>2</SMALL> is to add Sulphur (55g) to Sulphuric acid (120ml) + 2 grams of Fe<SMALL>2</SMALL>O<small>3</small> as catalyst and heat strongly. (Thanks to GarageChemist for that).<br>
The Perchlorate solution should be neutralized when all Chlorate has gone.<br>
There is some info. on making SO2 <a href="so2.html">here</a>.<br><p>
<h2>Ferrous Sulphate + H<SMALL>2</SMALL>SO<SMALL>4</SMALL></h2>
This is cheap and easy to obtain. The reaction products should not be a problem.
The Sulphate should be dissolved in the acidified water (the acid will stop Iron Hydroxide form forming, it is also necessary for the reaction that destroys the Chlorate)  first and then added to the solution that is being treated.<br>
6FeSO<small>4</small> + NaClO<small>3</small> + 3H<small>2</small>SO<small>4</small> ====> 3Fe<small>2</small>(SO<small>4</small>)<small>3 </small>+ NaCl + 3H<small>2</small>O<br>
Keep the pH  below 3 for the reaction to proceed and the solution should be heated/boiled.<br>
For every gram of Sodium Chlorate that needs to be destroyed you need 1 * 6 * 3.66 = 22 grams of FeSO<small>4
</small>:7H<small>2</small>O, quite a large amount. (3.66 is the ratio of the molecular weights). If using anhydrous Ferrous Sulphate you would need 8.6 grams.<p>



<h2>Ferrous Ammonium Sulphate  + H<SMALL>2</SMALL>SO<SMALL>4</small></h2>
Same as Ferrous (II) Sulphate but it is more expensive and harder to get.
Does not oxidise in air as  Ferrous (II) Sulphate does and won't form Hydroxide when added to water. Keep solution below pH 3 for destruction reaction to proceed. Heating or boiling should be used. You will need quite a lot per gram Chlorate.<br>


<h2>Strong acids</h2>
HCl is the best acid to use. Wouters page explains the process and is thus:<br>
Acid is added to the solution to be treated and the solution is boiled. Yellow gas is released (the more Chlorate the more gas) as the Chlorate is destroyed. <p>
2KClO<small>3</small> + 4HCl ===> 2KCl + 2H<small>2</small>O + 2ClO<small>2</small> + Cl<small>2</small>
<p>This yellow gas is ClO<SMALL>2</SMALL> and is explosive at concentrations above 10%. It is also very toxic, as is the Chlorine gas, and should not be inhaled under any circumstances. You should use an excess of HCl acid and heat for a long time as the reaction can be sluggish especially when the acid is dilute. If using HCl, any excess acid can be gotton rid of by boiling. There should not be large amounts of Chlorate present (as with all the other methods) when adding acid. The solution is them basified with NaOH (or appropriate hydroxide or carbonate if you are concerned for the final colour that the produce will make when burned) and the presence of Chlorate should be checked for using some of the sensitive tests for Chlorate. 
HCl acid can be purchased at the builders providers and is used for cleaning cement.<br><p><hr>
