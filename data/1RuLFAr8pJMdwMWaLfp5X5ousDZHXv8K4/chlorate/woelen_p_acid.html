<h2 align=center>Perchloric acid from Ammonium Perchlorae, Nitric acid and Hydrochloric acid</h2>

<pre>
Failure while method looks promising


I purchased some ammonium perchlorate, hoping to be able to make perchloric acid, according to the method, 
mentioned in the attached file. I tried several times, but the experiment is a total failure each time.

I took ammonium perchlorate, nitric acid (65%) and hydrochloric acid (30 ... 35%), in the quantities as
 mentioned in the attached document, but scaled down a factor 50. The acids are general lab grade and are
 clear colorless liquids, not the usual yellow stuff from a hardware store. The ammonium perchlorate is
 from a seller, geared towards pyrotechnics. It is a coarse crystalline solid which dissolves completely 
 and gives perfectly clear solutions in distilled water. Normally one has to ballmill this coarse material
 when used for pyrotechnics, but for my use in chemical experiments it is perfectly OK.

When heating the mix, the solid ammonium perchlorate dissolves with difficulty. At a certain point in time,
 a lot of gas is produced (first, a lot of orange gas is produced, probably a mix of NOx and ONCl from the
 aqua regia formed), but lateron the gas mix becomes colorless. The liquid goes from colorless, when cold 
 and just mixed, to yellow/orange, when heated and lateron it becomes colorless again. I kept on heating 
 and had the liquid boiling for a long time and in the meantime producing nasty dense fumes. But finally,
 the clear liquid more or less solidified and a white crystalline mess was produced. At that point I stopped
 heating and quit the experiment. I have the idea that I just boiled off water and acid. 

I expected that after some time I would end up with a clear liquid, which remains clear without any solid
 matter in it. I have to conclude that this method of making perchloric acid does not work very well, at
 least not in my setup. Are there any other people who have experience with this method? It sounds very
 good. Coarse ammonium perchlorate without anticaking agents can be obtained fairly easily where I live 
 and it would be a great source of the hard to obtain perchloric acid if this method works. 
 Any suggestions from other people are welcome. Simply heating a mix for a while does not work,
 you just boil off most of the acid. Probably part of the ammonium is destroyed
 (you get a lot of colorless gas), but only a part. Maybe the colorless gas was only in small amounts.
 Due to the boiling it may look much more impressive than it actually was (small bubbles of gas can act
 as starting points for formation of large gas bubbles from boiling liquid).
 
 
 From 'Roscoe Bodine' (below)
 
 Maybe try a half scale experiment in the same two liter flask and use a cold finger or a reflux condenser. 
 There must be a loss of the volatile acid reactants rather than the loss of volatile byproducts which would 
 explain why the reaction desired is not proceeding and you are being left unreacted starting solid material
 because it didn't have the required contact time and reaction conditions.
