<H2 align=center>Ammonium Perchlorate from Sodium Perchlorate and Ammonium 
Chloride</H2>The following assumes that ALL traces of Chlorate have been 
destroyed before conversion of the Sodium Perchlorate into Ammonium Perchlorate. 
If there are traces of Sodium Chlorate present, Ammonium Chlorate will form, and 
this will give a dangerous unstable product.

 See <A 
href="destroy.html">Destroying 
Chlorate by chemical means</A> for to eliminate all Chlorate.

<P>
<H3>Method 1</H3>You can scale the following up or down:<BR>Looking at the 
mutual solubility diagram below we see that since 
NH<SMALL>4</SMALL>ClO<SMALL>4</SMALL> is the least soluble of all the possible 
products at low temperature it will precipitate/crystallise first. However, if 
your solutions are too concentrated NaCl will also precipitate, contaminating 
your product. So, aim to have about 33g of NaCl per 100g of water at the end of 
your conversion as this is just below the saturation point of NaCl (see graph).
<P>Now, 33g of NaCl is 33g/58.5g = 0.564 moles of NaCl.<BR>You need 0.564 moles 
of NaClO<SMALL>4</SMALL> per 100ml water, that's 0.564 * 122.5g = 69.1g 
NaClO<SMALL>4</SMALL><BR>The amount of ammonium chloride required is 0.564 
moles, which is 0.564 * 53.5g = 30.17g NH<SMALL>4</SMALL>Cl<BR>This will produce 
0.564 moles of NH<SMALL>4</SMALL>ClO<SMALL>4</SMALL> which is 0.564 * 117.5g = 
66.27g NH<SMALL>4</SMALL>ClO<SMALL>4</SMALL>
<P>Now, in order to get everything to dissolve you need to have the temperature 
at 90 degrees or slightly higher. If you go too hot you lose a lot of water due 
to evaporation. You should dissolve the NaClO4 first in a minimum of water @ 
about 90 degrees. Then dissolve the ammonium chloride in the rest of the water 
but this requires a lot of heating because ammonium chloride absorbs a lot of 
heat when it dissolves.<BR>Then simply add the solutions, mix and cool ever so 
slowly to -10 degrees or so over a period of about 24 hours. You can wrap the 
container is insulation and leave it to cool down to room temperature (in a warm 
place if possible). Then put into freezer, still wrapped, and cool further. 
Don't let ice form. The slow cooling will produce big crystals of ammomium 
perchlorate which are easily washed with cold water with minimum loss of 
ammonium perchlorate.<BR>The total amount of ammonium perchlorate produced is 
0.564 moles which is 0.564 * 117.5g = 66.27g. Not all of this will come out of 
solution but you should get about 50 grams.

<H4>How the Pro's do it</H4>The graph below shows the mutual solubilitys of the 
the relevent salts. The system is suited to fractional crystallization. Starting 
at point A the mother liquor is cooled, resulting in the crystallization of some 
Ammonium Perchlorate. The composition of the mother liquor is now represented by 
point B. Some liquid is now evaporated off (flashed off, as it is called) to a 
composition C. The evaporation is done in a vacumm and some Sodium Chloride, the amount being represented 
by the length of line segment C-D, will ppt out of solution so that the point D 
is reached. Some water is now added so that the starting concentrations are 
reached again, point A. Some more reactants are added (Sodium Perchlorate cell solution + 
Ammonium Chloride solution) to maintain the volume in the crystallizer system and the cycle is repeated. 
<BR>This process is continued 
repeatedly so that crystals of the proper shape, size and size distribution are 
obtained.<BR><SMALL>From: Chemical Engineering Progress (Vol. 57, No. 11, page

<H3>Method 2</H3>See US Patent No. 1,453,984 which is available <A 
href="us1453984.html">here.</A>
<P>Having read the patent it is simply a matter of using a weighing scale to 
keep track of your solutions so that you will know what percentage solution you 
are dealing with.
<HR>
The graph below shows the solubilitys of the relevent salts in both methods 
above. Ammonium Perchlorate and Sodium Chloride form what is called the 'stable 
pair', ie. they are the most two likely salts to ppt out of solution. This graph 
is not a mutual solubility graph.
