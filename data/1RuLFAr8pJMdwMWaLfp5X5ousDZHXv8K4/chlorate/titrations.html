<h2><u>Titration for solid sample</u></h2>

The Titrations described here are called back titrations. All Chlorate in the sample is destroyed and the amount of Chemical used up in the destruction process is ascertained and that figure is used to ascertain the original amount of Chlorate present<p>
A solution of Ferrous Sulphate in water + acid (acid Ferrous Sulphate solution) is made up by dissolving 7.0 grams of Ferrous Sulphate Heptahydrate (3.83g Anhydrous FS, or 4.28g 1H2O) in 80ml freshly boiled distilled water + 5ml concentrated Sulphuric acid (add acid to water first). This solution (approx. 85ml) is made up to 100ml. It would be better to use 10ml of acid according to other sources but 5 ml seems to be OK.<br>
Make up a solution of  0.1N Potassium Permanganate  (3.1608g per liter, 0.02M). You may need approx. 120ml per titration if you run a blank each time. You need to run only one blank if doing a number of titrations in a reasonably short time period.<br>
Obtain a 10% Manganous Sulphate (112g/l Monohydrate) solution.<p>

Weigh accurately a 0.1g (Chlorate + other) sample (previously dried over conc. Sulphuric acid for 24 hours) and dissolve it in 10ml distilled water in a 250ml flask.<br>
 Add 35.0ml
of the acid Ferrous Sulphate solution and boil gently for 3 minutes. <br>
Cool, add 10ml of 10% Manganous Sulphate (112g/l Monohydrate) solution and titrate the excess Ferrous Sulphate 
with 0.1N Potassium Permanganate solution. <br>
Run concurrently a blank with 35.0ml of the acid Ferrous Sulphate.<p>
% NaClO<small>3</small> = [(A-B) x 0.17742/W]<br>
where A = ml of K Permanganate solution used in blank, B = ml used in the sample test, W = weight of sample(use around 0.1g).<P>
The above can be used for testing an unknown with a Chlorate content from zero to 100% Chlorate. If you are sure your solid sample contains a low percentage of Chlorate (say a sample from the end of a Perchlorate run) you may want greater resolution than what the above can offer. Take a larger sample size to titrate (say 1 gram as opposed to 0.1 gram) and proceed as above. The % Chlorate will now be :<br>
%NaClO<SMALL>3 </SMALL>= [(A - B) x 0.1772/1.0]<br>
The 1g sample method will work OK so long as the percentage of Chlorate in the unknown is less than 15%, ie. from zero to 15% Na Chlorate.<br><p>
The advantage of this system is that no redox indicator is needed. Chemicals are easy to obtain. The biggest problem is that Cl<sup>-</sup> will 
interfere. This is prevented by adding MnSO<SMALL>4</SMALL> to the solution before titrating with K Permanganate. See <A   href="titrat.html">here</A> for more detailed info.<br><br>
Manganous Sulphate can be made with Sulphuric acid, K Permanganate and Oxalic acid. The MnCO<SMALL>3</SMALL> is then precipitated by adding
NaHCO<SMALL>3</SMALL>. The MnCO<SMALL>3</SMALL> was then washed and added to  Sulphuric acid to give MnSO<SMALL>4</SMALL>.<BR>
Note that it is <b>very</b> dangerous to add Sulphuric acid to solid K Permanganate, it should only be done in solution.<br>
Ferrous Ammonium Sulphate Heptahydrate, Fe(NH<Small>4</Small>)<Small>2</Small>(SO<Small>4</Small>)<Small>2</Small><b>:</b>6H<Small>2</Small>O, (molecular weigh 392.2g) can be used instead of the Ferrous Sulphate and it is in fact better as it does not get oxidized by Oxygen from the atmosphere. Use  9.8 grams per 100ml acid solution.<br>
It may be difficult to weigh 0.1 gram of solid if you do not have an appropriate scales. Dissolving 5 grams solid in a solution made up to 250ml will give you 0.1 gram per 5ml. This will be easier to measure.<br>
The procedure can be tested using pure K Chlorate which is easy to obtain pure by crystallization. Dissolve  11.5 grams K Chlorate in 500 ml solution  and use 5ml to give the equivalent  0.1g of 100% pure Na Chlorate as above. Titrating this should give a result of 100%.<br>
A redox indicator can be used in the above to more clearly show end points if you like. See <A   href="titrat.html">here</A> for more info on KMnO4 titrations.<br>
Solutions of Permanganate and Fe Sulphate should me made up fresh as they do not keep well for long periods though they should be OK for a few months in  tight capped bottles.  Attempt to keep the Permanganate concentration as accurate as possible. Wash the container(s) for  the Permanganate using a small amount of Permanganate solution before using them to get rid of organics. Make up more than one liter if you do not have appropriate scales. Use lab grade K Permanganate or recyrstallize to purify.

<p>
Take an appropriate sample size and add it to 10ml distilled water in a 150ml flask.<br>
 Add 35.0ml of the acid Ferrous Sulphate solution and boil gently for 5 minutes. <br>
Cool, add 10ml of 10% Manganous Sulphate (112g/l Monohydrate) solution. (Add a few drops of indicator if you are using indicator). Titrate the excess Ferrous Sulphate 
with the 0.1N Potassium Permanganate solution. Add one cc of the Potassium Permanganate at a time so that a distinct colour change (red as contents are
swirled if not using indicator) is seen at the end. 
When not using indicator  the red colour does not persist for very long and the solution will go to a more dirty Orange color within 40 seconds or so. If you get a red colour that does not dissapear when you add the first ml of Permanganate, you need to use a smaller sample size from Chlorate cell.
<br> Run concurrently a blank with 35.0ml of the acid Ferrous Sulphate.<p>
NaClO<small>3</small> in grams per liter = [(A-B) x (1.7742/Sample size in ml)]<P>
where A = ml of K Permanganate solution used in blank, B = ml K Permanganate used in the sample test. (The blank should be in the region of 88ml)<br>
Use a 1ml diabetic syringe (with an integral needle, as these are more accurate that the type with a removable needle) if you do not have  a 1ml pipette for the small sample sizes. 50cc syringes are OK for the Fe Sulphate and Permanganate solutions.  <br>
If taking samples from a cell to track CE make sure the cell volume is the same at each sampling time.<br>
See notes above  in relation to the K Permanganate solution (make it up as accurately as possible).<br><p>
