DO NOT OBSCESS OVER THE <i>"VOLTAGE NEEDED TO MAKE CHLORATE (OR PERCHLORATE)"</i> OR THE <i>"VOLTAGE NEEDED TO GET THE REACTIONS TO HAPPEN" </i> ETC ETC.<p>

 Most amateur Chlorate cells that you read about are operated at 5 Volts and the owner will announce that you 'need 5 Volts to get the Chlorate reactions to happen' and you 'need 7 Volts to get the Perchlorate reactions to happen'. Amateur Chlorate cells are very often driven with an old computer power supply. This supply puts out a steady 5 Volts. You are <b>STUCK </b> with 5 Volts. It has nothing to do with the cells 'needing five Volts to make Chlorate' or needing five Volts 'to get the reactions to happen'. If the cell Voltage is increased to say 7 or 8 Volts this does not mean that 'the Perchlorate reactions will start to happen' or that the cell will start to make Perchlorate.<br>
This type of bull-shit is constantly dripped out (or plopped out to be more technically correct)  time and time and time and time again.<p>
The theoritical Voltage needed to 'make Chlorate' is really the theoritical Voltage needed to get Chlorine gas to form at the Anode plus the Voltage needed to get Hydrogen gas to form at the Cathode. These Voltages (standard electrode potentials as they are called) are calculated on paper using lots of high falutent stuff involving thermodynamics. They have  a value of around 1.36 and -0.82 Volts respectively giving an overall theoritical Voltage (Voltage needed to make Chlorate (dare I say!)) of 2.18 Volts.<br>
When a cell is operated the actual 'Anode Voltage' and 'Cathode Voltage' can be measured and are measured by scientists working in the field using  a third electrode in the cell called a reference electrode. These electrodes can be  of various types, for example, a saturated Calomel electrode (SCE), a Silver Chloride electrode and a standard Hdyrogen  electrode (an unyeildy beast I believe). In practice Voltages above 1.36 and -0.82 Volts are observed. This 'extra' Voltage that is observed is called overvoltage or overpotential. You have both Anode overvoltage and Cathode overvoltage. This Overvoltage or overpotential is made up  of various components which we will not go into here (look it up in Wiki if you like) and it varies with temperature, electrode (Anode or Cathode) current density, Anode or Cathode material and lots of other things. The smaller the overvoltage the better as it means that less power will be consumed by the Chlorate making cell which is very advantagous to industry. It is not that important to the Amateur as their power supplies are usually hopelessy inefficient anyways (when compared to industry) and their cells will have relatively large spacings between electrodes leading to more Voltage drop and energy wastage.<p>
Sometimes the Amateur will actually increase the spacing between the Anode and the Cathode so that there will be more Volts dropped accross the space (wastes power too) so that the cell will draw less current from the power supply and not overload it or cause it to shut down.<p>
The actual Voltage between the terminals of a  Chlorate cell will be the sum of the following Voltages:<br>
 The Voltage dropped by the wire/runner leading from the positive cell terminal down to the Anode plus 
<br> the Voltage dropped by the Anode plate itself plus<br> the Voltage drop accross the Anode coating plus<br>
 the theoritical Voltage required to make Chlorine gas plus<br> the Anode overpotential for Chlorine production plus  <br> the voltage drop accross the electroylte solution from Anode to  Cathode (the space between Anode and Cathode) plus<br> 
the Cathode overpotential for Hydrogen production plus<br> the theoritical Voltage needed to make Hydrogen gas plus 
<br> the Cathode coating Voltage drop (if there is a coating) plus<br> the Cathode plate Voltage drop plus<br>
 the drop in the lead wire/runner going from the Cathode to the cell  negative terminal. <br>
 In an Amateur cell being run with a 5 Volt computer power supply and good thick wires between the supply and the cell terminals, all these Voltages will <b> HAVE TO </b>  add to 5 Volts because the power supply is supplying a rock steady five Volts. If the cell is large (large electrodes) or/and the space between the Anode and Cathode is small then the supply may shut down as too much current may flow, or to put it another way, the resistence of the cell will be too low for this particular  5 Volt power supply as the current that the supply can output (at the rock steady 5 Volts remember) is too low. 
<P><br>
When a cell is supplied by a constant Voltage source (a computer power supply) the  current drawn by the cell will increase as the temperature of the cell increases. To put this another way the resistance of the cell decreases as the temperature rises. This is mainly caused by the actual electrolyte becoming less resistive and there will be less Volts dropped accross the space between the Anode and Cathode. This Voltage that is not now being dropped accross the Anode/Cathode space will now be dropped somewhere else in the cell (perhaps Overvoltages rise as the current density on the Anode and Cathode increases). The cell terminal Voltage is still five Volts remember, because thats what the supply puts out! (assuming good thick wires are between the cell and supply).
<p><br>
When it comes to Perchlorate cells the Voltage used to drive current into the cell is somewhat higher than Chlorate cells because the resistence of  Perchlorate cells is somewhat higher that Chlorate cells. This increased resistence is caused by a number of things including the fact that the reaction that happens at the Anode (the discharge of the Perchlorate radical as it is oftern termed (lets just call it the 'Perchlorate reaction')) has a value a bit higher than Chlorine discharge Voltage (as you get in a Chlorate cell). Hydrogen gas is generated at the Cathode just like in a Chlorate cell. Overvoltages are higher as very often the current density on the Anode and Cathode is larger than in a Chlorate cell. The electrolyte resistance may be higher. Cell temperatures are inclined to be lower. It is desirable to have  a supply that puts out more than 5 Volts when supplying a Perchlorate cell in order to be able to 'shove' enough current into it.<br>
Look up a thing called Ohms law!<br> But 5 Volts will make Perchlorate  if you have the Anode and Cathode close together, the cell warm and you are (therefor) happy with the amount of current going into it.<p>
Do please remember that you need the proper Anode material for Perchlorate making.<br>
Constant current supplies are nice to have when making Chlorate and Perchlorate but they are by no means essential.<br>
When a constant current supply is connected accross the cell the current into the cell will remain constant. It will have the same value of Amps when the cell is cold or hot or if you move the electrodes closer together or further apart. The Voltage accross the cell will vary as the resistance of the cell changes (when for example warming up). Do not use a constant current supply that has too high of an open circuit Voltage output (you will see this Voltage when the supply is disconnected from the cell) as this can cause severe problems with connections overheating if the connection becomes corroded and its resistance rises. A welder used as a supply can have this problem. Be careful of fires when using a welder.   <br><P>
So what happens when I connect a twelve Volt power supply (computer power supply lets say) to my Chlorate cell?<Br>
Too much current will be driven into the cell. If the power supply does not shut down (ie. if it's a large power supply) this will cause the Anode to have too large a current density (too many amps per square centimeter working area) and lead to Anode damage. The Anode damage is probably caused by Oxygen being evolved at the Anode surface. The cell may heat up too much and boil. The high current will not damage Cathodes IMO. <br>
