<h2>The Sodium Chlorate cell</h2>
One could talk for a very long time indeed about the design for a Sodium Chlorate cell.<br>

The amateur usually finds it difficult to know where to start when it comes to setting up a cell. It can be
very confusing when one reads all the information available on the topic. Most of the reading material is 
geared toward the industrial producer (or sometimes the scientist who is studying the subject) who will have
a different set of constraints forced upon him when compared to the amateur. The amateur will not be too sure 
how much quantity of product to make, how much money, time, effort and space to allocate to the project.
Very often the starting point will be the power supply that is to hand, or the Anodes that can be made or purchased easily . Sometimes it will be decided to make
a certain amount of product per time and having decided this, go on to obtain Anodes and a power supply.
<br> The amateur will not be terribly interested in making the cell as small as possible, 
getting maximum current or power efficiency or having the smallest possible voltage
across the cell. <br>The amateur will (very often) be interested in Anode wear rate, whether or not the 
power supply to hand is suitable or how much product will be produced per week.<p>The amateur will be using (probably) a non pH controlled cell, this is OK. All industrial setup's use pH control. <p>
 The amateur will probably use what is to hand which may be a cheap power supply, cheap Gouging rods etc. The cell container can come in the form of a bucket with a lid. 
The plastic that the bucket is made from must be able to withstand the cell electrolytes and fumes. A PVC bucket is ideal. Some holes are drilled in the lid to accommodate the electrodes and a vent tube. 
The vent tube is useful as it allows gasses to be vented out of the building in a controlled manner. A hole about 5cm in diameter is also made in the lid for looking into the cell and also for adding water or NaCl solution as required. A piece of plastic is needed for to cover this hole and stop fumes and mist from getting out of the cell onto connections etc.<br>
 The electrodes should be sealed into the lid because if fumes and mist are getting on connections you will have problems trying to maintain them. 	Also gases coming to the surface of the solution generate 
a mist of the solution which 
will drift out of the cell. This mist will rust and corrode all metal objects in the vicinity of the cell and beyond!.<p>

The design parameter that always raises it's head is the <b>Anode current density</b>. This parameter
is important because you must keep below a certain Anode current density to avoid eroding the Anode excessively. This is 
particularly true with Graphite. Anode current density is the Anode current (cell current) divided by the 
total surface area of the Anode which is in the electrolyte. It is usually quoted in Amps per square cm.
When you have decided what the Anode surface area will be and what the current density on the Anode will be, you will know what the maximum 
current through your cell can be. You do not have to run this 
maximum, you can run less current into the cell if you so wish but. <p>
Another design parameter that gets discussed is the ratio of the size of the cell (the liquid volume) to the current going into the cell. This in not a critical parameter. It has little effect on current efficiency. When the current going into the cell is raised (if you add more Anodes say and adjust power supply) and the cell volume is  kept constant in order to shorten the run time of the cell, there will come a point where the heat generated by the process will not be able to escape fast enough from the cell and the temperature of the cell will be too high. If you must run a large current into a small volume of electrolyte you can keep the cell cool by putting it into a large container of water. Industrial setup's uses cells that are small in  relation to the current going into them. They use cooling coils in the cells to keep the cell cool and transport heat away. This keeps the real estate used by the cells small. The amateurs cells can be large in comparison to the current going into them. The only disadvantage in doing this is that the run times of the cells can be long. This can leave the impatient amateur feeling as if nothing is happening at all as he is forced to wait perhaps two weeks before he can take out a crop of Chlorate. The cells WILL still be making Chlorate at the same rate as a smaller cell with the same current going into it.  <p>

The amateur very often comes up with some weird and wonderful arrangement of  electrodes  for to stop Chlorine gas escaping from the cell. It should be noted in industry that most cells use a very simple arrangement of parallel plates in a vertical arrangement. With the Amateur cell the pH is not controlled. It is  impossible for Chlorine gas to escape out of a cell which has a high pH (Amateur cell). There will be a smell of Chlorine at the start but once the pH rises no Chlorine of any significance will come out of the cell. Add NaOH or KOH at start if  
 there is a problem regarding smell of Cl2.<P>

The temperature of the cell (IMO) is of little importance to current efficiency in non pH controlled set up. All Chlorate is made by electricity (not by species meeting in the bulk of the electrolyte as you have in pH controlled setup's) with little or no bulk chemical reactions going on. Temperature should be kept at a level so that Anodes are not damaged/eroded. Very low temperatures may cause Na or K Chloride to come out of solution.<p>

The power supply for to supply the cell with this current will ideally be a controlled 
current source. With a controlled current source you set the power supply to put a certain current 
into the cell and the voltage across the cell will vary as the cell resistance varies. <br>
Most power supplies for sale or to hand are NOT controlled current sources. They are 
controlled voltage sources (either fixed or variable). <br>


This means that when you connect the supply to the cell the Voltage 
across the cell in rock steady at whatever the Voltage of the supply is set at (assuming the supply is not being abused) and the current put into the
cell is dictated by that (rock steady) Voltage and the resistance of the cell.
 If the supply has a variable Voltage
 output then the current can be varied by lowering or raising the Voltage of the supply.<br> When the power supply is a fixed voltage 
output (you cannot vary the Voltage with a knob. An example is a computer power supply) then the only way you can vary the current is by 
manipulating the electrodes in the cell or you could add a resistor or a number of diodes in series with the line going into the
cell to lower the current. With a computer supply (5 Volts output) the current going into the cell will 
probably be within acceptable limits. If you have a fixed 10 or 12 volt supply then the current will 
probably be excessive and you will need a resistor or diodes to limit current. Diodes work by dropping 0.9 Volts across themselves, they effectively lower the power supply voltage seen by the cell by approx. 0.9 Volts. Another trick with a 12 volt supply, is to put two cells in 
series so that less current will flow into each cell. <br>
12 Volt battery chargers can make an acceptable supply as they tend to have controlled current characteristics.
They are a half way house between a controlled current source and a controlled Voltage source. <br>
You will need a current meter in the line going into your cell (or in the power supply itself) in order
to measure current. Voltage across cell can also be noted with a meter if desired. <p>

Do not get obsessed with the Voltage across the cell. The voltage across the cell will have a value
no doubt. Some folks  are inclined to latch onto the voltage appearing across the cell as if it were
some very important, almost magical, parameter. Some times you will hear a statement like:
"I ran my cell at 3.6 volts, therefore I was making Chlorate. I increased the voltage to 7.4 volts 
 and I am now making Perchlorate". It is NOT the Voltage across the cell that decides if you
 are making Chlorate or Perchlorate. If the Voltage is too low not enough current will get pumped into the cell. This will give you slow production. If you have a bad connection which causes a large Voltage drop this will lower current going into the cell too. <p>

<h4>Cathodes</h4>
Titanium is King when it comes to Cathodes. Use the CP grades as the alloy stuff is inclined to warp. Keep the plate fairly thick (3mm or so) as very thin plate can become brittle and fall apart in a short space of time due to the Hydrogen which is produced at the Cathode surface.  Ti is relatively expensive. Stainless steels are next best but be aware that if they corrode (as when you do not have the cell in operation perhaps) they will release Iron and Chromium (not good with LD) into your cell. Cathodes are inclined to corrode in the space above the electrolyte. Using high grade SS (stuff that will not stick to a magnet) is probably best.<br>
 A flat Anode should have a Cathode on each side  so that the current is evenly distributed on the Anode surface. Keep Cathodes small as this will decrease reduction (unwanted) reactions that occur at the Cathode surface.<p><br>

 <IMG border=4 alt="[Cell too tall for Anode]"  src="too_tall.gif" ></td><td>

<h4>Cell shape</h4>
The shape of cell is not very critical but do not place a short Anode/Cathode unit into a deep cell as the bottom half of the electrolyte will not take place in the action as it will be cold and will remain unmixed. A tall cell will need regular stirring.<br>If running a K cell it can be advantageous to have space at the bottom of the cell for K Chlorate to accumulate. You could allow perhaps one Cathode to go to the cell bottom for stirring as the H gas coming from the Cathode will keep the cell agitated. Having over sized Cathodes is not very wise either as it encourages unwanted reduction reactions.

<h2><font color=green> pH Controlled cells</h2></font>
If you intend to control the pH of the cell in order to increase the current efficiency and to decrease Anode wear then you should think of the cell as having two distinct areas. <br>
<ul>1) The area next to the Anode
<br>2) The  (so called) bulk solution area<br></ul>
 Different reactions take place in these areas and they should be treated differently  if the maximum advantage is to be taken from controlling the pH. See 'Cell Chemistry' section for details. A two compartment cell is best. The compartment containing the bulk of the liquid should be much larger that the area containing the Anode. The compartment containing the Anode should be kept cool (below 40C or so) for Graphite, but this is not so important for other anode materials. The bulk area should be allowed to get hot (70C or more) so that the bulk reactions are encouraged. The diagram below depicts a possible two compartment cell with a crude crystallizer. It will take quite some time before Sodium Chlorate will begin to appear as crystals in the bottom of the third container.
<IMG border=4 alt="[pH controlled cell and crystallizer]" 
hspace=10 src="phcell.gif" vspace=10></P>
A one compartment system can be used also. It should be fairly large in relation to Anode size so that bulk reactions can take place in order to obtain maximum benefit from pH control.<br>

See Wouters page for more information on cell design.
<p>There is further information and some long winded discussions on general cell design <a href="celltalk.html">here</a>.</P>
<p>There is description of a continuous K Chlorate production cell <a href="carl_tauch.pdf">here</a> from Carl Tauch (taken from pyrobin files without permission!).</P>

<br><p>
<h2>The Sodium Perchlorate cell</h2>

There are only two Anode materials for use in Perchlorate cells namely Platinum and Lead Dioxide. Boron doped Diamond will work if you can get it! Pyrochlores are another new material that has been reported in a patent but no reports of it being made or tried by Amateurs has been reported. <br>Reports of using other Anode materials to produce Perchlorate in a <i>sensible</i> fashion are pye in the sky.<br>

The Anode current density in Sodium Chlorate cells can be quite high and can be much higher than Chlorate cells. The Voltage across Sodium Perchlorate cells will be higher both because of the higher current density on the Anode and the fact that reactions going on at the Anode demand a higher Voltage when compared to Chlorate cells. <BR>
The size of the Cathodes (and therefor the Cathode current density) can be lower if you so wish as there is no Hypochlorites in Perchlorate cells that will get converted back to starting ingredients (salt) by Cathodic reduction. Damn all Chlorate will be converted back to salt at the Cathodes and even less Perchlorate. <BR>
There is a lot of conflicting reports of effects of pH on current efficiency. CE can be effected by pH depending on other cell parameters but generally CE is unaffected by pH. Keep pH below 11 if using Lead Dioxide Anodes as they will be eroded.
