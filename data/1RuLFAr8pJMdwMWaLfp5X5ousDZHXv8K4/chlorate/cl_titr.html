<h2> Simple Chloride Titration</h2>

You will need:<br><ul>
 A weighing scale that will weigh to at least one tenth of a gram.<br>
 Two 1ml diabetic syringes and a 10cc syringe with needles. (or burettes).<br>
 Small clear glass container that holds approx. 30cc.<br>
 Silver Nitrate.<br>
 Indicator. </ul>

Weigh out 1.453 grams Silver Nitrate and dissolve in approx. 40 cc water and make the solution up to 50cc.
 Store in a stoppered bottle. This quantity of reagent will do at least 50 tests.<br>
Indicator is Sodium or Potassium Chromate. About 4 grams Chromate dissolved in 25cc water is OK. If you do
not have any Chromate you can use Dichromate. About 4 grams Dichromate dissolved in 20cc water mixed with 
1 gram Na (or K) Hydroxide dissolved in 5cc water. 25cc total of indicator. About 6 drops of this is used 
per titration. <br>
Take a 1cc sample of solution to be measured for Chloride concentration using a diabetic syringe.
 Add this 1cc sample to the quantity of water shown in the table. You will have an idea of what the 
 approximate concentration of Chloride is in the solution before you start. If not then use the 
 0 to 350 value and titrate again if more accuracy is required should the actual concentration turn out
 to be much lower.<br><p>
<table border align=right hspace=10><tr><td><center>Estimated<br> concentration <br>of Na Chloride<br>
in grams per liter</td><td>Add to 
</td></tr>
<tr><td>0 to 350</td><td>349cc</td></tr>
<tr><td>0 to 200</td><td>199cc</td></tr>
<tr><td>0 to 100</td><td>99cc</td></tr>
<tr><td>0 to 50</td><td>49cc</td></tr></table>
Mix well and take 10 cc of the now diluted sample and place into a  clear glass container
that  gives a clear view of it's contents and holds approximately 30cc. Add another 10cc water to the
10cc already in the 30cc container.<br>
Add 6 drops of the indicator solution. The Chloride sample solution to be titrated will be a yellow colour.<br>
Take 1cc of the Silver Nitrate solution using a diabetic syringe.<br>
Drop the Silver Nitrate into the sample solution stirring all the time. Insoluble Silver Chloride is formed and 
the solution will have a cloudy but still yellow colour.<br>
A slight permanent red colour indicates that all the soluble Chloride has been transformed into insoluble 
Silver Chloride.<br>
The concentration of Chloride per liter of solution can be calculated from the following.<p>
NaCl(grams per liter) = ['Add to' value from table + 1] * [cc's AgNO<small>3</small> solution used]<br>
KCl(grams per liter) = ['Add to' value from table + 1] * 1.276 * [cc's AgNO<small>3</small> solution used]<p>
Example: If the estimated value of Na Chloride was 150 g/l and 0.6 cc of AgNO<SMALL>3</SMALL> solution was used 
to precipitate all Chloride (permanent slightly red colour obtained), then the Na Chloride concentration is:<br>
[199 + 1] * 0.6 = 120 grams per liter NaCl.<br> <p>

If you need some practice with this system it is a good idea to make up a solution of 200 grams per liter 
NaCl by weighing out 100 grams NaCl and dissolving in water. This solution is then taken up to 500ml. Practice on this solution to get an idea of when the colour change should be deemed to have happened.<br><p>
<B>Note on accuracy:</B><p>
The best you can do with a diabetic syringe is &plusmn;0.02 cc (one drop off needle). When using the 0 to 350 dilution this gives an error which corresponds to &plusmn;7 grams per litre Chloride in a sample. In a 4 liter cell this will give an error of 4 * 7 = 28 grams Chloride for a particular time. If two samples taken in succession have a 0.02cc titration error going in the opposite direction this will give a error of 2 * 28 = 56 grams (Sodium) Chloride in the cell which corrosponds to an error of 56 * 1.82 = 102 grams (Sodium) Chlorate. This can have serious implications if using measurements to ascertain %CE if only a small amount of Ah's have been ran through the cell between samples.  Run a fairly large quantity of Amper hours through the cell between  samples. Alternatively you can dilute the Silver Nitrate solution to make a dilution of  four times greater that recommended above. That's 1.453 grams Silver Nitrate in 200 cc water. You will need to add four times as much of this now diluted solution to obtain end conditions (red colour). This will give an maximum error of  &plusmn;1.75 grams Chloride, down from &plusmn;7.0, assuming of course that you are still measuring to &plusmn;0.02ml. The formula for obtaining Sodium Chloride concentration will now be:<br>
NaCl(grams per liter) = ['Add to' value from table + 1] * [cc's AgNO<small>3</small> solution used]/4<p><br>
Some points:<br>
If taking samples from a cell to track CE make sure the cell volume is the same at each sampling time.<br>
Use a diabetic syringe with an integral needle as they are more accurate.<br>
Use a dedicated syringe for the Nitrate and Chloride solutions.<br>
Always eliminate bubbles from syringes.<br>
Weigh the  Silver Nitrate as carefully and as accurately as possible.<br>
Hyprchlorites or Chlorites do not interfere with the test but it should be noted that if you test a 
sample from a cell and then test the same cell contents that has been boiled, there will be a small increase
in Chloride concentration due to destruction of the Hypochlorites. Boiling increases the amount of Na Chloride by approx. 2 to 3 grams per litre assuming Hypochlorite concentration is approx. 4 to 6 grams per litre (value in commercial cells).<br>
There is a more exacting Chloride titration procedure in the Sodium Chlorate section under "Collection of Graphs and Tables".<p>
<h4>Chlorate determination</h4>
The Sodium Chlorate in a Chlorate  cell can be calculated by knowing the <u>starting</u> amount of Na Chloride per liter and noting the fact that each gram of Chloride that is no longer present will have formed an amount of Chlorate equal to  1.82 * [Chloride no longer present] in grams per liter assuming the volume of the cell is the same as at the start. If calculating the total Chlorate in the cell do not forget to multiply this figure by the cell volume in litres.<br>
