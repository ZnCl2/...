Sodium Perchlorate is not used in 
pyrotechnics due to the fact that it is hygroscopic. It has three hydrates 
containing 0, 1 and 2 water molecules. It is used to make Ammonium or Potassium 
Perchlorate and other Perchlorate's by double decomposition.<BR>The Chlorate and Perchlorate stages are best separated.
<P>
Start with solid Sodium Chlorate and dissolve it in water to make a 50%(wt) 
solution (that's approx. 720g Chlorate per litre of solution) of Chlorate and 
run it for the amount of time recommended in the run time section or until the Chlorate concentration is low.<BR> You could also start with a solution of Chlorate that has a low amount of Chloride in it. When using Pt it is recommended to have NO Chloride. LD can tolerate Chloride.

materials can be SS, Graphite, mild Steel, Nickel and Titanium. Phosphor Bronze has been used by industry.<p>
When mild steel, Bronze and Nickel is used, Chromate's are desirable to stop the Cathode from being 
attacked by the Hypochlorous acid in the cell electrolyte. (0.5 to 5 grams/Liter). Chromates also increase 
current efficiency by stopping reduction at the Cathode (the conversion of
Chlorate and Hypochlorite back to Chloride, though this happens to only a tiny extent in Perchlorate cells).<br>
 Chromate's are not compatible with Lead Dioxide. Use Titanium as a Cathode if
you can get it.<br>
Sodium Fluoride or a Persulphate may also be used  to stop Chlorate or 
Hypochlorite being converted (reduced)
back into Chloride at the Cathode but remember Fluoride cannot be used with Ti substrate Anodes. Fluoride also raised the Oxygen over-potential at the Anode which means less Oxygen gets produced giving higher %CE. Additives are best left out IMO except perhaps if using Pt and you are attempting to keep Anode erosion to a minimum by keeping Chloride from appearing via Cathodic reduction.
<P>When using Platinum as an Anode it's wear rate will increase as the Chlorate 
concentration decreases, and below 50g/l it  may be excessive, high temperatures also 
increase it's wear rate. Wear rates from manufacturers have been reported
as 3 to 6 grams Pt per ton Sodium Perchlorate in cells ran with a high concentration of both Chlorate and Perchlorate (no Chloride). <br>
The concentration of Chlorate should be kept above 100g/l if a high current efficiency is 
desirable. <SMALL> (The Perchlorates. Schumacher J.C. P86)</SMALL><BR>
The temperature of the cell is usually maintained at 
about 30 to 60<SUP>o</SUP>C. The current density on the Anode is usually much 
greater than with Sodium Chlorate manufacture, and high current density's do not 
decrease current efficiency. Typical Anode current densities are from 150 to 
400mA per square cm for Lead Dioxide Anodes and 200 to 500mA per square cm for 
Platinum. Most commercial plants use water circulation through coils in the cell 
for to remove heat generated in the cell to stop it from overheating as the cell volume is small in relation to the Amps going through the cell. The 
Amateur can keep the cell cool by putting it sitting in a large tub of water or 
by keeping the current per volume low at around one Amp per 300ml of 
solution or less.<BR>The Voltage across a Perchlorate cell is higher than a Chlorate 
cell and will be in the range of about 4 to 6.5 volts.<BR>The cost of electrical 
power for to make one Kg of Na Perchlorate from Na Chlorate is about two KWh 
(two "unit's" of power) which is approx. 18 US cents.<BR>



<P>To start your cell about 700grams Na Chlorate are dissolved in some water and 
more water added to make one liter (A solution of Sodium Chlorate containing 
700g/l has a density of 1.428 and is 49%(wt) Sodium Chlorate, see Graphs and 
table's in the Sodium Chlorate section). Commercial cells also have a very high concentrations of Sodium Perchlorate in them and this helps to increase %CE, ie. high ionic strength solutions raise the CE. <BR>
<BR>The current is turned 
on and the cell is run for the appropriate time as outlined in the run time 
section. The product is then either turned into K or Ammonium Perchlorate (see 
relevant section) or solid Sodium Perchlorate is extracted and the mother liquor 
is returned to the cell for the next run of the cell.<BR>
All mother liquor should always be returned to the cell as it will be rich in Chlorate and Perchlorate because of their high solubility.
Note that Platinum Anodes will corrode if used to reduce the Chlorate concentration to a very low value though I do not know how severe the erosion will be. You need Lead Dioxide if you wish to run a cell from Chloride to Chlorate to Perchlorate to Low Chlorate concentration, without stopping. This is not a sensible use of a Lead Dioxide Anode as erosion takes place and the runs are long (very long if not using pH control) which will wear the Anode. Running the Chlorate concentration to very low levels (less than one gram per liter) using a Lead Dioxide Anode is OK and gives little or no erosion of the Anode. It is a low %CE process though.<p>
 There is a good description of a Perchlorate cell using a Platinum wire Anode at the bottom 
of this page by GarageChemist. In his cell you must use Dichromates to stop Chloride from forming in the cell and you must
start the cell with zero (thats 0.00%), Chloride in the electrolyte to avoid Pt Anode erosion.<br>
<BOLD>SMALL</BOLD> amounts of Chloride in the cell are a Pt Anode killer.<p>
There are a number of descriptions of Perchlorate cell runs using Lead Dioxide Anodes under 'Titanium Substrate Anodes' in the 'Lead Dioxide Anodes' section.<br><P>
Since Sodium Perchlorate has a number of hydrates this will need to be noted if yields are being weighed and calculated.  Which hydrate forms depends on the solution concentration and temperature as your product crystallizes. The usually hydrate that forms (between zero and 50&deg;C) is the mono-hydrate. This mono-hydrate must be heated to 60&deg;C to obtain NaCl0<small>4</small>:0.8H<small>2</small>O. It must then be heated above 150&deg;C to obtain anhydrous Sodium Perchlorate.
Melting takes place at 472&deg;C and decomposition starts at 490&deg;C and ends at 520&deg;C. <small> (Reactivity of Solids 3 (1987) 75-84)</small>
