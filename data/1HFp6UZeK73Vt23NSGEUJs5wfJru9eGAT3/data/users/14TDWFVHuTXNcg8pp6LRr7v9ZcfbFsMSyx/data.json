Now I'll let it run until I've watched all the films I wanna watch on the British Netflix or until Netflix blocks my VPS – whichever comes first.\nI think the film industry and Netflix are most imprudent in their ways of handling this.",

However, the answer to your question is still the same. Whether this is an expeditent way of backing up files is another kettle of fish.",
