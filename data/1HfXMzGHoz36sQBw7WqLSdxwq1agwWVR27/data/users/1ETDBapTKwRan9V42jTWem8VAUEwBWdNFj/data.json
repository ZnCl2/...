			"title": "Vue - $emit not working from parent to child",
			"body": "So I'm trying to add event handling to my Vue app and am having a hard time.\n\nIn the parent, I have a method that emit's a signal:\n\n```\napp.$emit(\"updateSomething\", value);\n```\n\nIn a Vue component, I'd like to run a method when this $emit fires, but because this is a component of app, app doesn't actually exist yet, and thus I can't do the following in `mounted`:\n\n```\napp.$on(\"updateSomething, function(value) {\n    console.log(\"Got value: \" + value);\n});\n```\n\nI tried making another Vue instance to act as a global messaging bus, but the child Vue component still isn't able to access that instance in its `mounted` method.\n\nHow do you handle calling child methods from the parent Vue app? Is there another way other than $emit? Am I doing something wrong? To be fair this is the first time I've ever used $emit and $on in Vue so still finding it a bit hard to understand.",
