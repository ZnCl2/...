			"body": "Greetings KxoQA,\n\nI'm creating a digital safe-space for a community of mine and I'd like to create in on ZN due to the server-costs and need for anonymity of the community. I would copy a website like ZeroTalk or ZeroMe but I have some specifications for the system that I'd like to be met. First and foremost, I'd like an expandable system that allows for many users and data, for this I was thinking hubs. The second goal is something more moderated, as to prevent trolls and other problematic individuals. I understand that on a decentralized system, that'd be harder. Any good solutions or ideas?\n\nThanks in Advance!",
