			"body": "Hello, i am not a programmer alas, but i am curious how GitCenter (http://127.0.0.1:43110/1GitLiXB6t5r8vuU2zC6a8GYj9ME6HMQ4t) works while probably main repository is at https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/\nIs there any sync, or it serve as a backup and for testing the things? For example if a programmer contribute to the ZeroNet based repository, he also needs to do the same for Github based repository? Thanks and sorry if this is a dumb question.",

			"title": "How to hotlinking images from other zites?",
			"body": "Hello,\n\nhow can i ensure my zite visitor will see \"embeded\" images on my site while these images address will be other zite address? I mean per current zeronet workings, such embeded images will not load in case the visitor not visited that site on which these are hosted.\n\nIs it sufficient to invite my site visitor to first visit the site from which i will be linking the images? The images are optional on that site, so will not be downloaded upon home page visit. Will ZN download them automaticaly when \"hot-linked\"?\n\nOr other way - can i add an iframe to my zite, which will automatically load also other zite or the image in iframe?\n\n[glightstar suggested](/1TaLkFrMwvbNsooF4ioKAY9EuxTBTjipT/?Topic:1556467817_1Mi7rUdBpQc99kfuvippGxgEbM7ZKdSXUD/Hotlinking+images+from+other+zites#comment_120_14K7EydgyeP84L1NKaAHBZTPQCev8BbqCy) that one may create script that will ask visitor if he want to download images but as i am not a developer i do not understand scripting.",
