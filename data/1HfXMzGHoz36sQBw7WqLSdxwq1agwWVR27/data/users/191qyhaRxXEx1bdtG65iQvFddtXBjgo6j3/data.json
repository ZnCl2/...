			"body": "Hi,\n\nI'm creating a Zite but I have no idea on how to create a thumbnail. This is important because if I have to display the images in smaller version instead of thumbnails, the images will be downloaded and since there will be a lot, it will weight a lot, making the \"optional\" side of these images kind of useless. So how could I do that ?",

			"body": "I found the JS but it uses tons of other functions over the JS file and I'd have to rewrite all my code and learn + use hundreds of their lines to be able to use this. Considering the input gives a blob, I have no idea how to resize it. After hours of research, every single solution tells me to get the image in the input ( Which there isn't, apparently. I mean these StackOverflow threads are from 2010... ), resize it in a canvas and THEN convert it to blob to send it. Apparently I can't modify it. ",
