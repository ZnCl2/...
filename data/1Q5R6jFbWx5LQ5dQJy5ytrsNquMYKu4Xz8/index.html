<p>You might think that streaming music over the internet is better for the environment than buying physical copies (like CD's, vinyl discs etc) but a <a href="http://sciencenordic.com/how-music-listening-effects-climate">recent study</a> <em>(clearnet link)</em> shows that may not be the case. If you think about it it's not that strange. Say you buy a CD of your favorite music, there will be an environmental impact in the resources used for manufacturing and greenhouse gasses released when shipping the disc to you. After that energy will only be used when you actually listen to it. But if you choose streaming music this data will have to be delivered from servers in large data centers located in several places around the world. Those servers run day and night the whole year around and use a lot of energy, even when no one listens to the music in question.</p>
<h2 id="backing-up-humanity">2018-12-20 Backing up humanity</h2>
<p>Ok, first post. This blog will probably stray from strict environmental issues to also be about things commonly associated with transhumanist topics.</p>
<p>Many dangers face the human civilization, most urgent is global warming but there are also other scenarios that threaten humanity (asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes, deadly gamma-ray bursts and so on). The later scenarios threaten not just human civilization but human survival as a species. Say that sunlight would be blocked out for a significant time-period, several years perhaps. The shortage of food would make humanity severely endangered as a species, perhaps reducing us to very small groups of individuals. Such small groups might not prosper in the long run, even if the conditions on Earth improve.</p>
<p>To reduce the risk of future extinction, humanity should back itself up on other planets, for the time being Mars is the most likely candidate. The late Dr Stephen Hawking was talking about this before his death I believe.</p>
