I would put a warning in your ban list that you sensor political speech and content from users you think are offensive. Also several sites you said that there were active bit mining applications and I found nothing to back that up at all. No html references to any program that was bit-mining in the background and no processes doing that.  Needless to say your ban list is disturbing to me that you feel it is your obligation to pick and choose what content others can see or not see. Everyone has a delete button and a block and ban button on Zeronet. Use it when you feel it is necessary.  I would rename your ban list to say suggested ban list.   ",
