            "body": "<p>Prologue</p>------------------------------------------------<br><br>It\n started out, like many good stories begin, with another boring day at \nsome lousy nine-to-five. But it wasn't any boring day. For one because \nit was night, but that's beside the point. I was on my way out of the \nbuilding to do my usual cigarette break while&nbsp; waiting on that damn mail\n server to boot up. I passed Dominica, the haggard old janitor from \nsouth the rio grande. She said hello and I offered some token hand \ngesture of acknowledgement to that regard. Exiting the building, I \npulled out my pack of Lucky Strikes. The good ones. Not the ones I had \nbeen saving for a special occasion, but the really good ones. And that's\n when I noticed something was off. The nicotine hit harder than it \nshould have. Way harder. These weren't my good cigarettes, they were my \nPCP cigarettes! <br><br>I began to question my decision not to label the\n pack laced with mind-altering narcotics when I was struck with an even \nbigger question. Why the hell did I have those with me? Was it because I\n always carry a pack of PCP laced cigarettes on my person? No, that's \nexactly what they want me to think. Clearly this was planned. The KGB \nwas hatching an elaborate conspiracy against me, and there was only one \nway to stop them!<br><br>On my way back in I saw Dominica, and she made \nsome offhanded comment about how I didn't look so good. Damn! Those \nbastards got to Dominica, too? Or was she always one of them?<br><br>\"Â¿SeÃ±or? Are you okay? You do not look so good...\"<br><br>\"LIES!\"\n I shouted at the top of my lungs, \"Slander and lies! I- Wait a minute. \nIf you're Mexican why the hell are you speaking English?\"<br><br>She seemed genuinely confused. A good act, but I wasn't having it.<br><br>\"Que?\"<br><br>\"It's too late for that!\" I roared as I let my left hook fly.<br><br>I\n tasted the blood before I felt my fist making contact. Which was weird,\n because I know for a fact commies don't bleed. It could only mean a \nsecond party was conspiring against me!<br><br>\"Who are you working for?!\"<br><br>\"United Custodial!\" She wailed between sobbing, \"Please don't hurt me! Have family!\"<br><br>\"Of course. How could I have been so blind?\" &nbsp;<br><br>It all made sense. My eyes were open to the truth, and I had no intention of blinking.<br><br>\"You aren't a Soviet spy... You're a Nazi!\"<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter One - Dial 666 For Satan</b></u><br><br><br>So, I'm a drug lord, now.<br><br>It\n was this whole mob thing, you know how it goes. I found a little bit of\n maybe a few hundred keys of coke inside some greaseball's apartment, he\n comes home, trips over his dead wife, and all of a sudden he falls on \nall the bullets coming out of my gun. And I guess a lot of it can be \nabsorbed through the skin, because I don't know WHEN I stole that boat, \nbut it is wasted, I mean just absolutely trashed. I just abandoned it on\n the beach. Million dollar yacht, and it's absolutely destroyed.<br><br>Oh,\n right, so, I didn't, y'know, show up unannounced to a foreign country \nand suddenly become the cartel or anything. First thing I did was to \nswing a rusty pipe I found, and sure enough, here's some dude talking on\n an iPhone, and wouldn't you know it, he just walks right into the pipe I\n totally wasn't swinging at him. I tried apologizing, but he seemed \npretty out of it; I don't know, he was probably some junkie. But. on the\n up-side, guess who found a free iPhone nearby? I know there's a lot of \niPhone hate, but to be fair, you have no idea how many \"lost flip \nphones\" I had to find before that point. Not one of them had internet \naccess. Punk ass bitches.<br><br>So, because I'm not an idiot, I bribe \nthe little aztec dude at the supermarket with a gram of coke in exchange\n for looking the other way while one of those prepaid mobile cards went \nmissing. Naturally, they all went missing, along with the cash in the \nregister, seventy five boxes of Chocodiles, plus all of the tequila, \nNyQuil, and outdated hustler magazines they had. Also, wouldn't you know\n it, he also ran into my rusty pipe while he was off in the water-closet\n frosting the tips of his mustache. Coincidentally, I found about two \nlines short of a gram of cocaine, plus the keys to the back, and even \nsome free surveillance footage tapes. How lucky am I, right?<br><br>It \nwas around sundown when I got to the end of what has to have been hands \ndown the longest two miles of dirt road in the history of ever. It was \nsome hill overlooking a small town, but they had power lines running \nthrough the jungle, so I guess I shouldn't have been taken aback to find\n the dingy little motel offering insanely overpriced wifi on what has to\n be hands down the slowest internet connection in the entire world.<br><br>Now,\n I figured I'd need some help if I was going to evade INTERPOL and their\n robot kill-hounds so I tried to find some of my Colombian relatives on \nsocial media now that I had a new iPhone. And since I was using an \niPhone on ass-slow internet speeds I would use the platform designed for\n ass-slow old people! Facebook! So, I got in contact with one of them, \nfiguring at least a city councellor might know a decent place for me to \nlay low for a while. Except I can't explain that I'm on the run from the\n mafia, or that I've got a duffel bag filled with cocaine, or that I'm \neven trying to blend. And that was my first mistake. Turns out I \nunderestimated the whole, family super-bond thing, because instead of \nhelping me rent a low-key appartment, I found myself in the one place \nmost likely to draw attention to me. The home of an ambitious senator \nliving in Cartagena.<br><br>So, pretty much the first day I'm there, \nCarlos, we'll call him, introduces me to his family. It's him, his wife,\n and his three kids. The wife is okay, beter looking than most women her\n age in this hellhole. Though, judging by the size of their home I came \nto the conclusion that he was doing quite well for the supposedly \ncleanest running candidate. She's also a livid drunk, and a lot more fun\n after the sun goes down and the glasses stack up. Makes sense; being \nforced to keep up appearances in public must get stressful when you've \ngot an entire city's eyes on your husband's career. The twins, \nidentical, both not too bad, in their own right, were about fifteen or \nso, and were apparently football stars. It'd take a while before I \nlearned that meant soccer, here.<br><br>Columbia is weird.<br><br>---<br><br>\"Up. Get up.\"<br><br>... Nnnghhh.<br><br>\"La cocaina. Show it to me, now.\"<br><br>It\n was an unusual way to be awakened at three in the morning, but I have \nto give it to the man for bringing the machette. And the backup pistol.<br><br>\"How the hell did you know?\"<br><br>He laughed and lowered the revolver. Severely confused, I raised an eyebrow.<br><br>\"Pinche,\n gringo. You show up in my country unannounced, with no luggage, wearing\n the clothes of a... how you say, douchebag? A... Ah... What is phrase? \nActing like a total Andy Dick.\"<br><br>\"Six of one...\"<br><br>\"Also you are soaked in blood and you haven't once let go of that duffel bag in the entire ten hours you've been here.\"<br><br>Beat, and in desperate need of my morning cocaine, I opted to concede defeat.<br><br>\"Yeah, I guess it is totally-\"<br><br>\"Obvious, yes? I am aware of this.\"<br><br>\"Ha.\n Talk to me about obvious. You're pretty well off for a city councelman.\n Wonder what kind of skeletons you have in your closet.\"<br><br>\"In the dog bowls, actually.\"<br><br>\"What, not the garde-Wait what about the dog bowls?\"<br><br>\"That\n is, after they are finely ground in the basement, mixed in with arroz, \nmaiz, some chick peas, perhaps a dash of pepper... You get the idea.\"<br><br>\"God damn, dude.\"<br><br>\"And if you do not wish to meet the same fate, you will hand the cocaina over to me.\"<br><br>\"My nigga. I knew you weren't legit.\"<br><br>\"This is Columbia. Who the fuck do you think is?\"<br><br>\"Not me, that's for damn sure.\"<br><br>\"Yes, and, clearly not me, either.\"<br><br>\"So where does that leave us?\"<br><br>\"You have information about me, I have information on you.\"<br><br>\"And enough firearms between us to have every LEO in the city swarming the survivor.\"<br><br>\"How you say, slow your roll, amigo. I am not going to kill you.\"<br><br>\"Oh yeah, well I- Wait, say what now?\"<br><br>\"Yes, what is wrong with you? I would not kill you.\"<br><br>\"You lost me.\"<br><br>\"You\n are family, and since we both have evidence of the other's criminal \nhistories, you will live here, pushing cocaina to wealthy tourists until\n you feel safe to return to los Estados Unidos.\"<br><br>\"And if I refuse?\"<br><br>\"Don't.\"<br><br>The\n twins entered the room after that, or, just one of them. Not sure \nwhich, but he had a bit of coke caked on to the rim of his nostril and \nhe looked lit.<br><br>\"Ninety-seven percent.\"<br><br>\"You are joking?\"<br><br>\"Tested twice.\" he smirked, tapping the bulb of his nose like a cocky dickhead.<br><br>Carlos weighed out a pound and tossed it over to me.<br><br>\"Have this gone in fourty eight hours.\"<br><br>\"How the hell am I supposed to move a pound of cocaine in fourty-eight hours?\"<br><br>They broke out in laughter.<br><br>\"Look around you! This is the tourest capitol of Columbia!\"<br><br>---<br><br>The\n next day they took me to do some shopping, and I learned how to dress \nmore like an arrogant white douchebag. I have to hand it to the twins, \nthough. They know what looks good on me.<br>I assumed I'd just be \nwalking the beach near the resort, but we stopped in on one of the \nbeachfront restauraunts, really modern place. Obviously, expensive and \npacked with white people. The one girl who hadn't been bussing tables, \nas it turned out, was Sofi, whom I failed to recognize at first. See, it\n had clearly been a while since I'd visited, which was once, when I was \nlike, ten. Back then, Ana Sofia was this annoying brat who, despite \nbeing a tight piece of loli derrierre, was still annoying. Now she was \nseventeen, and I'm still harder than diamonds.<br><br>I mean, it's \ncompletely disorienting to see that she's a whole different person. She \nwas with some friends, and I guess they didn't recognize me at first, \neither, but they were pretty flirty off the bat.<br><br>\"Aye, es guapo, no?\"<br><br>\"Why is it always the handsome ones who are gay?\"<br><br>\"What, is it because of them?\" I asked, gesturing nonchalantly to the twins.<br><br>\"You mean you aren't...\"<br><br>\"No, no. I mean, maybe that one time when I had a bit too much Sangria, but besides, they're my cousins.\"<br><br>They broke out laughing, and Sofia slapped them.<br><br>\"Cayate, he doesn't know.\"<br><br>\"Doesn't know what, now?\"<br><br>\"Cousin marriages are pretty common around here,\" Alejandro pointed out, pinching my ass as he sat down to my left.<br><br>Before I could respond, Daniel snuck up and slapped my ass, before taking a seat to my left.<br><br>\"Really tightens the family bonds.\"<br><br>They both started making obscene gestures which, as far as hazing goes, not as bad as I was expecting this whole thing to be.<br><br>\"I'm not gay, I mean, allegedly. Mardi Gras, it's all fuzzy but I'm, like, ninety percent sure I've never done anything gay.\"<br><br>\"Hear that, Sofia, he's still available.\"<br><br>\"Shh!\"<br><br>\"Right down the hall, too.\"<br><br>\"Is this for real? Serious shit, if you're still hazing me, cut it out.\"<br><br>Just then, the waiter brought the drinks, which I downed faster than a dying man in a desert.<br><br>\"What is the matter with him?\"<br><br>\"Long story.\"<br><br>\"Did he at least bring the cocaine?\"<br><br>I nearly spat my drink.<br><br>\"You know?\"<br><br>They laughed.<br><br>\"You're dressed like a douchebag, wearing sunglasses indoors, and you haven't once let go of your bag since you got here.\"<br><br>\"Exact same speech, twenty four hours ago.\"<br><br>\"Shut up, and where do we do this? The car? I don't feel like bribing the restroom attendant with my lead pipe.\"<br><br>Before I could react, Sofi had already snuck the coke out and on her second \"sample.\"<br><br>\"Â¡Es incredible!\"<br><br>\"Bullshit. Let me.\"<br><br>More\n snorting, and a surprising amount of rich white people not giving a \nsingle solitary fuck at the scene unfolding around them.<br><br>I don't \nknow what they were shouting, but I'm pretty sure it meant this was some\n damn good coke. I was starting to get the idea that this would be \neasier than expected when some of the other patrons offered to buy some,\n themselves. Our food had only just arrived before I came to the \nconclusion that I'm really going to like it here.<br><br>I looked around in disbelief.<br><br>\"Is no one gonna stop this?\"<br><br>Alejandro chuckled.<br><br>\"We are in the cocaine capitol of the world.\"<br><br>\"Our tourism is primarily wealthy gringos and university students looking to see a little snow when they visit our beaches.\"<br><br>\"Oh my god.\"<br><br>\"Right?\"<br><br>\"Totally obvious.\"<br><br>\"Like your withdrawls.\"<br><br>\"What? Oh, yeah. You noticed?\"<br><br>Sofia\n cut another line for me, and the last thing I remember before I woke up\n was the oddly enthusiastic grins of anticipation as they watched me \ntake a nose dive.<br><br>---<br><br>The blaring alarm clock was bad enough, but I could've done without my throbbing... Head... And a...n...ussss...<br><br>I\n slowly rolled my head to see, yes, Alejandro. Knowing what I'd find, \nbut still in that spacey state of disbelief, I turn the other direction \naaaand...<br><br>\"WHAT THE ACTUAL SHIT-\"<br><br>\"-Are you novinhos doing in my bed?!\"<br><br>\"Wait, no, I'm telling you, I'm not gay, I just blacked out and-\"<br><br>\"Oh, honey, there's nothing to be ashamed of.\"<br><br>\"Wh- I-\"<br><br>\"Not you! Them.\"<br><br>\"Oh boo.\"<br><br>They bounced back and forth with the teasing, slinking out of bed and down the hall.<br><br>\"Wait, I don't even... Did they? Did we-\"<br><br>Before I knew it, Sofia had a finger to my lips.<br><br>\"You talk too much.\"<br><br>She\n moved in for a kiss, and holy shit. That electric fucking shock when \nher tongue pushed past my lips. Depending on who you ask, we made out \nfor either five minutes or half an hour. When she finally broke away, \nthere was some definite afterglow.<br><br>\"Are you ready for round two?\"<br><br>---<br><br>\"Seriously, though-\"<br><br>\"For the last time, nothing happened.\"<br><br>\"Not the twins. You.\"<br><br>\"Oh?\"<br><br>\"Yes, my god Soph, I can't feel my legs.\"<br><br>\"You're complaining about that?\"<br><br>\"Who's complaining?\"<br><br>\"What's there to complain about?\"<br><br>\"Well,\n as tasty as it was, I wasn't too big on using my tongue to clean the \nspooge out of your-MOTHERFUCKER! WHAT THE SHIT-\" Catching myself, I \nclear my throat, \"...Are you doing in here, Ma'am?\"<br><br>\"Don't mind me, mijo. Desayuno will be waiting when you're ready.\"<br><br>And\n with that, she began to unfold the laundry, taking her sweet time \nbefore heading to the twins' room. Meanwhile my mind drew up blank as I \nprocessed the fact that I just watched as the single most awkward moment\n of my life played out as though nothing was unusual at all.<br>&nbsp;<br>Sofia broke the silence.<br><br>\"Mind if I shower, first?\"<br><br>\"Please tell me that didn't just happen.\"<br><br>\"Que?\"<br><br>\"Your mom! How is she not flipping out?\"<br><br>Sofia arched an eyebrow, \"Seriouso?\"<br><br>\"Right, third world country. Totally forgot.\"<br><br>\"You're\n an ass,\" Sofia sighed as she went to shower, her thick hips swaying \nfrom side to side as she walked away, \"but at least you're good in bed.\"<br><br>\"Not like I have a choice.\"<br><br>\"Not what I meant.\"<br><br>For the first time in ages I got to relax from the stress of being wanted for all those mass murders I committed.<br><br>... And that was when I got the call.<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter Two - Foreign Policy</b></u><br><br><br>\"Are you sure?\"<br><br>I nodded.<br><br>\"Two hundred kilos. Cash up front.\"<br><br>Alejandro and Daniel exchanged worried glances.<br><br>\"We've never moved that much before.\"<br><br>\"At least, not at once.\"<br><br>I shrugged.<br><br>\"I have, it's real easy.\"<br><br>\"How do you figure?\"<br><br>\"Go in, get the money-\"<br><br>Sophie shook her head.<br><br>\"No, this could easily be a cartel trap.\"<br><br>\"What, no, li-\"<br><br>\"Sophia is right,\" Daniel interrupted, \"A first time buyer paying up front for that much?\"<br><br>\"Look, if you would just hear me out-\"<br><br>Alejandro agreed.<br><br>\"It could even be la policia.\"<br><br>I whistled loudly.<br><br>\"Oye!\"<br><br>\"Puto!\"<br><br>\"Bastardo!\"<br><br>Ignoring their insults, I went on.<br><br>\"Even if it's the cartel or the cops or whatever, we still stand to gain a lot here.\"<br><br>They all exchanged confused glances.<br><br>\"Look, obviously you guys have a lot of guns, right?\"<br><br>\"Si, and grenades as well.\"<br><br>\"Perfect! So even if it's not a trap, we go in, shoot up the place and take back the cocaine and the money.\"<br><br>\"You are joking, no?\"<br><br>I put on the most serious look I could muster.<br><br>\"I never joke about armed robbery.\"<br><br>\"I don't know, pissing off the cartel is a big mistake.\"<br><br>\"Agreed, we rely on them.\"<br><br>I raised an eyebrow.<br><br>\"For what?\"<br><br>\"Seriouso?\"<br><br>\"Oh, right. Your dad's a politician.\"<br><br>\"So obviously we can't pass up an opportunity like this, pero...\"<br><br>Suddenly, I got an idea.<br><br>\"What if we became the cartel.\"<br><br>They all burst out laughing.<br><br>\"No, seriously, we need a plan.\"<br><br>\"I am serious!\" I exclaimed, a little taken aback, \"How hard could it be?\"<br><br>\"The cartel are in charge of the police force, the military, and the entire drug trafficking scene here.\"<br><br>\"Picking a fight with them is like asking for a bullet in the head.\"<br><br>\"What if we killed their leader?\"<br><br>Sophie smacked me upside the head.<br><br>\"This isn't the highlander, you can't just kill the head of the entire cartel and expect them to bow down to you.\"<br><br>\"Why? Has anyone ever tried it before?\"<br><br>They were stumped.<br><br>\"Well, no, pero-\"<br><br>\"So what's the big deal?\"<br><br>\"You mean aside from the fact that it would be suicide?\"<br><br>\"You don't know until you try.\"<br><br>\"What kind of insane logic is that?\"<br><br>I smiled menacingly, holding up my knife.<br><br>\"The fun kind.\"<br><br>---<br><br>I\n stared down the face of death itself. Splinters of wood flying past my \nhead as the table gave way to heavy artiliary fire. Thinking fast, I \npulled out a grenade, kissing it once for luck before I tossed it over \nmy shoulder.<br>Or, at least, that's how I imagined things would go. But\n it turned out that killing the head of the cartel was way easier than I\n thought. I mean, I was so high I don't remember how we even pulled it \noff, so it seems pretty anti-climactic in retrospect, but I did get some\n serious stabbing done, judging by all the blood stains on my knife and \nclothes.<br><br>Aljeandro was dumbfounded.<br><br>\"I can't believe it worked.\"<br><br>Daniel was equally suprised.<br><br>\"I can't believe they just surrendered.\"<br><br>\"What did you expect?\" I asked, \"We just killed their leader.\"<br><br>Sophie held up a blood stained cell phone.<br><br>\"And also their successors.\"<br><br>\"Right? Hey how did we pull it off, anyway?\"<br><br>\"Seriouso?\"<br><br>\"Cocaine makes me black out.\"<br><br>\"Well...\"<br><br>---<br><br>Hours earlier...<br><br>\"So\n this is what we do. At three in the morning, we drive to their \nappartment to make the deal, killing any hired thugs in the process. \nThen we torture the HNIC until he gives us the location of his superior.\n We keep following the chain of command until we find out where the head\n of the cartel lives. Once we find his estate, Sophie, you cut the feed \nto the cameras while Alejandro and Daniel use these silencers to take \nout any patrols on the property. Once security is neutralized, I'll \ncreate a diversion using some gasoline and this book of matches I got \nfrom a strip club. Then we storm the compound killing every last mofo in\n sight.\"<br><br>\"What happens when their successors show up with reinforcements?\"<br><br>\"Good question. They don't.\"<br><br>\"Que?\"<br><br>\"Or,\n at least, not with reinforcements. See, we'll hold the head of the \ncartel at gunpoint, having him call each of his next in command up to \nthe estate where we will be waiting to ambush them with a series of \nhastily constructed traps.\"<br><br>\"That has to be hands down the most ridiculous-\"<br><br>---<br><br>Hours later...<br><br>\"Still can't believe we pulled that off.\"<br><br>I did a line of coke.<br><br>\"Never underestimate the things you can do when you're coked up.\"<br><br>Sophie shook her head.<br><br>\"Fine, you were right.\"<br><br>Alejandro began,<br><br>\"So, now that you're the head of the cartel...\"<br><br>\"What's our first order of business?\" Daniel finished, \"Aside from getting high, I mean.\"<br><br>\"Well,\" I grinned deviously, \"Whatever the fuck we want.\"<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter Three - Playing Politics</b></u><br><br><br>The manager of the First National Bank of Columbia slammed a fist down on his desk.<br><br>\"This is an outrage! You can't just demand all of our money like this.\"<br><br>\"Well, you say that...\"<br><br>I motioned to the cartel gunmen behind me.<br><br>\"You won't get away with this!\"<br><br>I laughed as I repeated myself, adding extra sarcasm for sentence seasoning.<br><br>\"Well, _you say that!_<br><br>\"La policia will show up any second to have you executed you little shit!\"<br><br>\"Funny story...\" Alejandro explained, \"See, we kind of are the police now.\"<br><br>Daniel elaborated on that.<br><br>\"To the extent that we killed the real police and nobody argues with our guns.\"<br><br>\"This- This is an outrage!\"<br><br>\"No,\" I corrected him, cocking my .45, \"This is a robbery.\"<br><br>---<br><br>\"Remind me again,\" Sophie demanded, pinching the bridge of her nose, \"What good did this do us?\"<br><br>\"See, by robbing half of the city blind, we create widespread fear in the other half.\"<br><br>\"Which\n we use to charge the other half for our protection racket,\" Alejandro \nexplained, \"And then we switch out every week or so.\"<br><br>Sofi was dumbfounded,<br><br>\"This is insane!\"<br><br>\"No,\" I corrected her, \"What's insane is the great deal I got on these five white tigers.\"<br><br>I patted the top of the cramped, rusted iron cage. From inside, an unseen jungle cat roared.<br><br>\"And\n if we want to stay in the black after that ludicrous impulse buy,\" \nAlejandro continued, \"We'll basically have to take over a whole other \ncartel.\"<br><br>\"Exactly,\" Daniel added, \"because you would not believe how much it's costing us to feed them.\"<br><br>I put on an annoying grin, slid up to Sophie, and ribbed her with my elbow.<br><br>\"And what are the chances of us pulling _that_ off, again?\"<br><br>Sophie sighed in defeat.<br>\"AYe dios mio.\"<br><br>---<br><br>Sophia\n pulled the car around, and we loaded the blood-soaked duffel bags into \nthe trunk. We spent the ride home in relative silence, taking in the \nfact that we siezed control over most of the cocaine trade in Columbia \nin the space of a night.<br><br>\"You didn't have to shoot him, you know.\"<br><br>\"Who,\" I asked, \"The blind old janitor?\"<br><br>Alejandro rolled his eyes.<br><br>\"Any of them.\"<br><br>\"Look,\" I explained, \"Blind people are dangerous.\"<br><br>\"To who?!\" <br><br>\"_Whom._\" I corrected Alejandro.<br><br>\"To nobody,\" Sophie growled, \"Because you sociopaths killed everyone in there!\"<br><br>\"Exactly!\" I piped up, \"Which is what he would have done with his Daredevil blind-guy judo powers!\"<br><br>\"You really are loco!\"<br><br>I snorted a line.<br><br>\"What's loco is how pure this stuff is. Come on, smell it. What are you, chicken?\"<br><br>Sophie\n slammed the brakes, sending the silver platter flying onto the \ndashboard as we all shouted angrily and confused. There was a brief \nmoment of silence, save for the sound of the platter spinning on it's \nedge faster and faster until it came to rest after an awkward and tense \nfew seconds.<br><br>\"I'm sorry,\" Sophie smirked, \"I'm a what?\"<br><br>\"COCK!\" I shouted, rubbing a bright red spot from where my forehead made contact with the seat in front of me.<br><br>\"And you're an ass.\" Daniel groaned, his glasses split in two from the impact.<br><br>\"How bout you buddy?\" I piped up, back to my old self, \"You holding up?\"<br><br>Alejandro,\n who I guess had a thing about abrupt stops, had puked a little into his\n lap and was hunched over. In place of a response he gave me the finger.<br><br>Sophie turned towards me and tried to get us back on topic.<br>\"Where to next?\"<br><br>\"I think it's time we paid the President a little visit...\"<br><br>---<br><br>Carlos\n shot out of bed when he heard the confetti cannon go off. Looking \naround, he saw the four of us around his bed. Then he saw the banner.<br><br>\"What is the meaning of this?\"<br><br>\"Suprise, you're the new President of Colombia!\"<br><br>He was dumbfounded, \"I am? How?\"<br><br>\"Because, papi,\" Sophia explained, \"We killed the old one.\"<br><br>\"Idiotos! The cartel will have my head! And the police would never allow it!\"<br><br>\"Calm down,\" I assured him, \"None of those people are coming after you.\"<br><br>\"Of\n course they are!\" He cried out as he hopped out of bed, \"El Presidente \nwas their biggest political advocate! Killing him is a death sentence!\"<br><br>\"Well, see, about that...\" Alejandro began.<br><br>\"We kind of are the cartel now.\" Daniel explained.<br><br>Carlos's jaw dropped.<br><br>\"Y... Y la policia?\"<br><br>\"All taken care of,\" Sofia smiled, \"We're in control of the authorities, as well.\"<br><br>\"In what possible way?\"<br><br>I laughed.<br><br>\"Because they can't arrest us now that they're dead.\"<br><br>\"And you did all this in a single night?\"<br><br>Sofia nodded.<br><br>\"You wouldn't believe how easy it was.\"<br><br>\"Even I don't believe it, and I was there.\"<br><br>\"Ditto.\"<br><br>\"So Mr. Mayor,\" I mused, \"What's your first order of business?\"<br><br>Carlos stood at the window, looking out into the sunrise as a streak of gold washed over him.<br><br>\"To take over the world.\"<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter Four - Problem Child</b></u><br><br><br>Somewhere deep in the jungles of Thailand...<br><br>A\n balding, gun-weilding stooge slammed a brick of cocaine down onto the \ndesk as a small child with a fierce temper leered up at him.<br><br>\"What the fuck is this?\"<br><br>\"Our latest shipment, sir.\"<br><br>\"THIS?\" He spat, \"This is hardly even a pound!\"<br><br>\"We have been had, it would seem.\"<br><br>\"Get me the head of the columbian cartel!\"<br><br>\"About that, sir, it would seem they're under new management.\"<br><br>\"How do you know?\"<br><br>\"It was what I was told when I called him.\"<br><br>\"Then bring me the head of the new cartel leader!\"<br><br>\"Like, the actual head, or...\"<br><br>\"It's a figure of speach, moron!\"<br><br>\"Oh, right away, sir!\"<br><br>---<br><br>We\n woke up that night unsure of what we were hearing. It sounded like a \nmix between a scream and gunshots. Bursting into his room, we feared for\n the worst. What we saw was only marginally worse. There, like a \nsleeping walrus, Carlos lie riddled with bullet holes. A knife sticking \nout of a single brick of coke. Pierced through that coke knife was a \nnote.<br><br>And I knew what needed to be done.<br><br>---<br><br>\"You can't go to Thailand!\"<br><br>I slammed the trunk down.<br><br>\"I sure as shit can.\"<br><br>\"Esta loca!\"<br><br>\"No, Sofia,\" I glared at her, \"What's loca is the fact that I listened when you idiots-\"<br><br>I pointed towards Alejandro and Daniel.<br><br>\"-Told me nothing could possibly go wrong.\"<br><br>\"What? I thought we could save money by diverting product away from Thailand.\"<br><br>\"Plus, cutting the costs of delivery with that drone was brilliant.\"<br><br>\"Yeah, no it isn't,\" I insisted, \"That drone cost us 2.8 mil!\"<br><br>\"Eh, it's a long term sort of savings.\"<br><br>\"Yeah, it'll pay off.\"<br>-<br>\"You know, eventually.\"<br><br>\"It'd better,\" I growled, \"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to kick some dumb kid's teeth in.\"<br><br>\"You are serious?\" Sophie demanded, \"The Jade Dragons are like the mafia times twelve!\"<br><br>\"Their gunmen are more ruthless individually than the entire cartel-\"<br><br>\"Our cartel!\" I reminded him.<br><br>\"-Than OUR cartel as a whole.\"<br><br>I locked and loaded.<br><br>\"Exactly why we need to gain control.\"<br><br>Sofia got in the car.<br><br>\"I'm going with you.

We had, ah, secured a plane. By which I mean we held the entire \nairplane hostage until we got where we needed to be. When we were about \nfifteen clicks from the area the Jade Dragon headquarters was supposedly\n located, we grabbed our parachutes and jumped off. But not before \nkilling the pilots. Not because we had to, or because the passangers \nwere witnesses. We just did it for the lulz is all.<br><br>We passed a \nroaming patrol squad somewhere near a river whose name I have literally \nno idea how to pronounce, and Sofia got the jump on them.<br><br>\"Hands in the air!\" She shouted, pointing an AK-47 at them, \"Don't even think of resisting.\"<br><br>Before\n they could comply, I snorted a good-luck line of coke and dropped from \nthe trees. My knife in my hand, I was completely in the zone. I tasted \nthe blood splashing on my numb face, the glint of silvery steel flying \npast my eyes, as though it were someone else's hand doing the stabbing. \nIn that moment, time slows down, and your body seems to go on autopilot.\n It's as if nothing else exists, just you and the blade.<br><br>\"Okay, they're dead already!\"<br><br>I\n blinked, bewildered. I had completely forgotten Sofi was with me. \nLooking down, I admired my work. It may have been overkill, but an \naverage of sixteen stab wounds per corpse just doesn't feel like enough.\n That's why I stabbed them twenty five times. Each. Except for the one \nwho met my eyes when I was stabbing him. Him I did twenty seven.<br><br>\"Do you even need those?\" Sofia asked me, \"That's really gross.\"<br><br>I nodded, still in the zone.<br><br>\"I want the Jade Triad's leader to see the look of fear in his subordinate's eyes.\"<br><br>\"Whatever.\" Sofia rolled her eyes, \"Just hurry up before the sun goes down.\"<br><br>Bent\n over the corpses, I dipped my fingers in the hollowed out eye sockets \nof the Thai gang members and smeared two streaks of blood across my \ncheekbones.<br><br>\"Lock and load, bitches.\"<br><br>Sofia raised an eyebrow, giving me a look that was like, \"really?\"<br><br>\"What?\" I demanded, \"We just air dropped into Thailand and that's what you draw the line at?\"<br><br>\"Let's just get moving.\" Sofia growled beneath her breath, \"I have a bad feeling about this.\"<br><br>With that, we made our way out of the clearing and into deep shit.<br><br>---<br><br>\"Look,\" I reasoned, ignoring the deafening hissing surrounding us, \"It's totally not possible to avoid a cliche, here.\"<br><br>Sofia nodded in agreement, blowing a lock of hair away from her face.<br><br>\"It could be worse.\"<br><br>\"Oh absolutely.\"<br><br>\"I mean, you call this menacing?\"<br><br>\"It is a pit of snakes, though.\"<br><br>\"Hey!\" Someone shouted in the background.<br><br>\"Sure, but you could at least throw some scorpions in for good measure.\"<br><br>\"Hey! Listen to me you farang pieces of shit!\"<br><br>\"I would've gone with a cauldron of acid.\"<br><br>\"I'm partial to molten lead, myself.\"<br><br>\"Are you fuckers deaf or something?\"<br><br>\"Why lead over acid?\"<br><br>\"Because at least with lead you can Han Solo the guy.\"<br><br>\"Total myth. At those temperatures it's like cremation.\"<br><br>Suddenly, we were interrupted (rudely, I might add) by the deafening roar of machine gun fire.<br><br>\"Listen to me assholes!\"<br><br>\"Do you mind?\" I demanded, impatiently, \"We're trying to have a conversation, here.\"<br><br>The seven year old drug lord snarled at me.<br><br>\"How dare you!\"<br><br>\"Easily.\"<br><br>\"How dare you speak to me in such an insolent to-\"<br><br>\"Cayate!\" Sofia interrupted him, \"Do you not know how rude you are being?\"<br><br>\"I am the leader of the largest Thai crime syndicate!

Whatever it takes to not make my tinnitus any worse than it already is.\"<br><br>We both turned our heads over to the Jade Dragon leader.<br><br>\"You were saying?\"<br><br>\"I- You shorted me!\"<br><br>I laughed.<br><br>\"Kid, until you killed her dad I had no idea you even existed.\"<br><br>\"We had a deal!\"<br><br>Sofia corrected him, \"No, you had a deal with the old cartel.\"<br><br>\"I was promised 200 kilos a week!\"<br><br>\"Well now you're just being unreasonable.\"<br><br>\"You only sent one!\"<br><br>\"And look at how ungrateful you're acting.\"<br><br>\"I will kill you both!\"<br><br>\"Yeah, we kind of gathered that from the whole dangling over a pit of snakes thing.\"<br><br>\"Asps.\" Sofia corrected me, \"They're venomous asps.\"<br><br>\"Wh- How is an ass venomous?\"<br><br>\"No no no no, asps, with a P.\"<br><br>\"The things that killed Caesar?\"<br><br>\"You're thinking of Cleopatra.\"<br><br>\"Cleopatra didn't die of asps.\"<br><br>\"I'm pretty sure she did.\"<br><br>\"Do you idiots always act this way?\"<br><br>I turned my head towards the Jade Dragon leader.<br><br>\"One thing you should know about the new cartel, kid, we do things different.\"<br><br>\"We get the job done, but usually by complete accident.\"<br><br>\"Or out of dumb luck.\"<br><br>\"Almost entirely out of luck.\"<br><br>\"Yeah, we're usually too caught up with infighting and getting high to actually do our jobs.\"<br><br>\"Things just kind of line up for us.\"<br><br>All of a sudden, a Jade Dragon henchman busted into the room looking frantic.<br><br>\"Sir, the army has stormed the compound!\"<br><br>\"What? How long do we have?!\"<br><br>\"They're already insi-\"<br><br>Before\n he could finish his sentence, the henchman was interrupted by a series \nof gunshots, and the Jade Dragon leader ducked behind a barrel. As the \nshootout between a seven year old drug lord and the Thai military \nunfolded behind us, Sofia and I went back to what we did best.<br><br>\"So then what killed Caesar?\"<br><br>\"Brutus betrayed him.\"<br><br>\"Really? I thought it was Shakespear?\"<br><br>\"You're thinking of the play.\"<br><br>\"So it was based on a true story?\"<br><br>\"Not based off of.\" Sofia explained, \"That actually happened.\"<br><br>\"You will never take me alive!\" The jade dragon leader shouted, \"I die with my dignity!\"<br><br>The\n young child-leader of the Jade Dragon gang self-terminated with his \nknife, and a wave of heavily armed Thai soldiers stormed into the room. \nThey all aimed their guns at us, and I used what little of my hand \nwasn't tied up to wave an upside down hello.<br><br>\"Who are you two?\"<br><br>Sofia turned over to look at the soldier.<br><br>\"Ahhhh... Tourists.\"<br><br>The soldier was dumbfounded.<br><br>\"Tourists? In a thai drug lord's compound?\"<br><br>\"I know, right? Crazy what happens when you go on vacation.\"<br><br>The soldiers exhanged glances.<br><br>\"Seems pretty legit.\"<br><br>\"I agree.\"<br><br>\"Completely legitimate.\"<br><br>They\n cut us down and gave us a ride back to the airport. We didn't gain any \nland in Thailand, but by that logic we didn't lose any, either.<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter Five - Coming (Back) To America</b></u><br><br><br>A\n handful of weeks passed when it occurred to me I was actually kind of \nbored. Being the only drug lord in all of Colombia AND the President was\n a lot of work. People kept bugging me about bullshit like \"American \nmilitary intervention\" and \"not being recognized as a legitimate leader \nby the United Nations\". Also apparently diverting billions of whatever \nforeign money Colombia uses (Pesos? No wait, the Bolivar! Uhhh... \nRupees?) is something that you can only do if you're, you know, \nColombian. To the people of the country I was brutally exploiting, I was\n yet another CIA-planted dictator. Ironically, the CIA thought that too \nbecause they sent agents in to extract me back to the states when they \nrealized a revolution was incipient. And once they realized I _wasn't_ \nCIA they dropped me onto the nearest rooftop and took off. But not \nbefore thanking me for helping them continue to financially cripple \nanother already impoverished nation of brown people who had enough \nreasons to hate American imperialism.<br><br>Returning home was a \nhassle. And not just any hassle, a hassle I had to deal with for a solid\n three days completely sober. Well, except for whatever gas station \nboner pills I was able to steal. Now, riding a greyhound from the gulf \ncoast to the beaches of LA with a comedown on my heels and the pigs \nbreathing down my neck was bad enough on it's own. But you have to \nadmit, it's just a little worse knowing that, of all the crazy, white \ntrash bus people you're somehow the one getting all the weird stares. \nNot 600 pound, takes up two and a half seats, midwestern landwhale Betsy\n Nobbs who was wearing the ill-fitting mickey mouse shirt with camo \nsweats. Not meth mouth Bubba who didn't have a shirt. No, apparently \nhaving more bloodied leather on your person than a tranny dominatrix at a\n gay dungeon puts you on the lowest rung of the white-trash ladder. \nAnyway, I finally got back to the beach house, fiddled with the key for a\n bit before finally getting the front door open when \"GOOD LORD, MAN \nWHAT THE HELL IS THAT BEHEMOTH?!\"<br><br>The bobcat dug it's claws deep \ninto my buxom he-chest, teeth bared and snarling furiously like that one\n cougar who found out I didn't wear a rubber. I knew I was in deep shit!\n Or maybe I would've been, if&nbsp; Kid hadn't had the damn thing trained so \nwell.<br><br>\"Down, Jebbediah Oswald!\"&nbsp; Kid whistled, \"Heel kitty, good kitty!\"<br><br>The\n beast dislodged it's talons from my chest cavity and slinked back as my\n bitch of a little sister offered me a hand. Or, that's what I'd have \nbelieved if I didn't know any better. Slapping my last \nblood-and-coke-covered twenty into her deceptively dainty little hand I \nhelped myself to my feet. <br><br>\"...'Sgood to see you too.\" I groaned \nas my sister got to her feet and wiped a speckle of my jism from the \ncorner of her lips, \"One question...\"<br><br>&nbsp;Kid put a hand to her hip, raising an eyebrow quizzically,<br>\"Is it why you're suddenly such a cheap-ass?\"<br><br>I shook my head as I handed her a few hundred dollars, knowing she'd at least share some of the smack she bought with it.<br>\"Good to see you again, too.\"<br><br>Kid put on an over-exaggerated show of acting like an innocent, well-behaved little girl.<br>\"Is it about how I missed my loving, protective big brother so much I ran away from home to see him?\"<br><br>A pause.<br><br>\"No.\" I answered bluntly, just so done with her bullshit, \"No it is not.\" <br><br>Another pause.<br><br>\"... Are you gonna-\"<br><br>I gestured my hand towards the wild animal marking my fucking couch.<br>\"Jebbediah Oswald?\"<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter Six - Pol Potheads</b></u><br><br><br>Okay,\n picture this. You wake up with a throbbing... Everything. Mostly head \nand asshole, but everything hurts. You're face down in a pool of every \nbodily fluid known to man (and several known only to birds) and you're \npretty sure you've done all the drugs. Just... Just so many of them. The\n first thing you see is a goat staring down at you, but it's bleating \nlike a sheep which is a pretty good indicator that you've stolen it for \nthat exact reason. When the tinnitus wears off you hear the sounds of \nsirens and attack choppers. Yes, plural. Flood lights pour in through \nthe shutters illuminating a completely trashed hotel room, and someone \non a megaphone is shouting at you in a language you don't speak and \nthey. Sound. PISSED. <br><br>Just as you're trying to figure out where \nin the ever-loving fuck you even are, the Burmese army storms the room \nand that's the exact moment your underage sister comes out stark naked \nfrom under a pile of half-burnt rattan chairs wearing a large equine \nstrap-on, a Barack Obama mask straight out of the purge, and literally \nnothing else.<br><br>So, yeah, that's how my Saturday started out.<br><br>---<br><br>\"So?

And I mean about the charges, ass.\"<br><br>\"Yeah, take that tone why don't you.\"<br><br>\"Can you make this go away or what?\"<br><br>\"I don't know, maybe? I guess?\"<br><br>\"Jesus H. Christ Phil what the fuck am I even paying your outrageous retainer fees for, anyway?\"<br><br>\"Look,\n I'll do my best but shit man, I haven't even heard of half these \ncharges.\" My lawyer stressed, running his hand through his wispy gray \ncomb over, coffee stains lining his ratty gray suit, \"I mean Jesus fuck,\n what did you just invent new ways to break the law?\"<br><br>\"Look, I don't even remember how the fuck I got here.\"<br><br>\"You did enough drugs to black out and then had sex with an underage girl.\"<br><br>\"Who.

She's twelve!\"<br><br>\"Yeah, which obviously doesn't help your case any.\"<br><br>\"So why the fuck are they charging her for?

I'm forced up to my feet by a \nhandful of burly men. It's only been a couple of days, and I haven't \neven had a trial, yet. I couldn't see. The blindfold over my eyes took \ncare of that. I could hear though. And smell. It smelled a lot like \nblood. They dropped me onto my knees, but they pushed too hard and I \nfelt my skin scrape against a grainy concrete floor. Something told me I\n wasn't going in front of the jury.<br><br>That something was the sound of of an AK-47.<br><br>\"Great. I always knew this was how I was gonna die.\"<br><br>From the other side of the room, a familiar voice piped up.<br><br>An english voice.<br><br>It sent shivers down my spine.<br><br>Memories of my harrowed past.

I take it you're being executed, too?\"<br><br>The\n blindfold was removed, and I saw my little sister sitting atop a throne\n of severed heads. Khmer Rogue heads. She mocked the sound of a gameshow\n buzzer.<br><br>\"Guess again, douche-nozzle.\"<br><br>---<br><br>\"So, let me get this straight...\"<br><br>\"What, the horse dildo wasn't straight enough for you.\"<br><br>\"Strap-on!\" I corrected her, slightly more pissed off, \"And also...\"<br><br>&nbsp;Kid sighed dramatically, rolling her eyes.<br><br>\"Ugh!

Now, normally&nbsp; Kid would\n have sold it all at a ludicrous mark up, or just killed both our \nparents and cashed out the life-insurance policy they left us, but \nseeing as the police nearly caught on the last time she tried to murder \nour mom and dad (did I mention she did that, yet?) we had to compromise \nand settle for a classic \"blackmail the richest idiot we can find\" scam.\n Now, normally we'd go to hollywood since it's less than an hours drive \nif SOMEBODY could move her ass before rush hour, but since most rich \nhollywood stars already have an arsenal of child starlets to fuck, the \nwhole \"film&nbsp; Kid having sex with Leonardo DiCaprio\" scheme wasn't going \nto fly. Naturally, for anyone rich who isn't a movie star, there are \nkids literally walking the streets of LA if you know where to look. So \nthat left comic con, where socially-challenged man children with wealthy\n daddies and a secret, shameful longing to fuck little girls go to show \noff their ten thousand dollar iron-man suit cosplays along with other \nwealthy weeaboo cosplayers.<br><br>And I wish I could say we didn't get \nthe money except we totally did and also we killed someone who may or \nmay not have been the son of a Yakuza dude.<br><br>Did I mention we \nkilled someone in the Yakuza?

I swear, if I wasn't prolapsed we might have made\n it to the continental breakfast without running into the crooked cops \nfrom the shootout. At first we were afraid they wanted to avenge their \nfallen comrades, but it turns out they were actually a rival gang that \nwanted us to run drugs over the border.

Which is why our first stop was to drop\n the goods at a pharmacy before catching the robot dog fights.<br><br>Okay,\n I know what you're thinking. I'm going to explain and yes, it is as \nbadass as it sounds. But first, let me set the scene. It was a few years\n back when DARPA built a prototype robotic dog. Now, back then they were\n wonky and could only walk on flat surfaces like basketball courts. \nThere was some mild improvement right up until the government shut down,\n and that was when the science bitches got approached by the \nmother-fucking Clockwork Nazi Party. Yeah. Oh you thought robot dogs \nwere as over the top as it got? We're hitting all the tropes up in this \nbitch. So these nazis were cyborgs but like the kind of cyborgs from \nbefore the 80s. All analogue, just motor oil and red bandages and those \nbomb-ass Hugo Boss uniforms. Totally fucking metal, and they run the \nrobot dogfighting racket across the entire Afro-Caribbean circuit. They \nrun the shit out of it.<br><br>Only problem is, the Chinese-backed \nTurkmen Mafia (the other one, with the fleet of hover-carriers not the \none with the space-Voltron) picked that exact day to recognize my little\n sister and I in the crowd and next thing we know we had a bunch of \nassholes from Central Asia's letterbox sliding burlap sacks over our \nheads before braining us with what I can only assume was a wrench.<br><br><br>And\n maybe it was the cocaine or the rush from winning every bet we placed \n(Kid really knows how to pick them) but at some point we had decided we \ncould run the operation better. But we were never going to take the \nAfro-Carribean circuit from the Robot-Nazi Mexicans in some podunk North\n Mexican shithole town. Like every fuckin' MAN knows, the robot dog \nfights only get real in Quaracas, the most dangerous city in South \nAmericanistan.<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter Eight - The Not-So-Final Countdown</b></u><br><br><br><b>4:00 AM</b><br><i>T minus four hours until Z-Corporation goes public</i><br><br>Climbing\n the windows of Z-Corp, the international mega-corporation headed by \nJanet Reno that secretly runs the entire cyber-Nazi robot dog fighting \noperation,&nbsp; Kid and I were in the middle of yet another argument about \nhow we could have avoided strapping suction cups to our knees and elbows\n if we had just used the elevator like normal people.<br><br>But I ask you, is climbing a 60-story international super-villain's headquarters not totally badass?<br><br>\"No!\"&nbsp; Kid shouted, barely audible over the roaring winds, \"Because it's fucking freezing up here!\"<br><br>\"Well how was I supposed to know a backwards-ass hellhole would have backwards-ass weather?\"<br><br>\"Because we went to the same private school!\"<br><br>\"Well if I payed attention in school do you think I'd be scaling a building in Quaracas?\"<br><br>We reached the 42nd floor and I began the process of cutting a hole into the glass.<br><br>\"Besides, I already lost the receipt for the spy gear.\"<br><br>&nbsp;Kid scoffed, putting on a pair of prosthetic tits and arranging her hair to look like Adolf Hitler's wet dream. <br><br>\"Since when have you paid for anything?\"<br><br>I blinked.<br>\"Oh yeah.\"<br><br>\"You know what to do, right double-oh-stupid?\"<br><br>I\n pulled out the auto-hacking USB drive (it's a thing, shut up.) as if \njust to prove my point and we made our way to our mission objectives.<br><br><b>4:15 AM</b><br><i>T minus three hours forty-five minutes until Z-Corp goes public</i><br><br>\"Huh.

Our jaws agape at the sheer number of alien \ncorpses surrounding us. The battle was so epic I can't even describe it.\n There were laser spiders and factions of aliens who supported our \noverthrow of the Trans-Galactic Empire. There was a fight with a giant \npurple alien guy and I met a talking trash-panda and-</p><br>No... Wait.<br><br>That's the Avengers,<br><br><p>Anyway\n I ended up as the space president which I didn't really want until \nsomeone told me about space cocaine. So I put like a whole bag of space \nblow in my ass and next thing I know I was speeding my ass off while a \nspace politician walked me around the giant Intergalactic Space Base \nserving as the fortified palace for the space emperor, which I was \nreminded an almost insulting number of times was now me. I discovered \nthe holo-room which I was repeatedly told was not a Holodeck because \nthat was copywritten by Star Trek and therefore not something we should \nrefer to the holo-room as. But also fuck Americans and their copyright \nlaws. My first order as space dictator was to immediately rename all \nHolo-Rooms into<br></p><p>Holodecks. This did not go well. We got \nslapped with a massive lawsuit and I basically bankrupted yet another \notherwise doing pretty okay government body.</p><br><p>This led to a \nmassive revolution in record time (believe it or not, I've blundered my \nway into enough positions of power to have a top ten of those) but \nbecause the space army was entirely drones and because I was smart \nenough to triple the IT guy's salary in spite of the crippling economic \ndepression I caused, the army of drones was able to crush the revolution\n and just like that I squashed my first coup!<br></p><br><p><img src=\"http://127.0.0.1:43110/1EDDavbxFcxVfwZUEPU11LWPrgfTrSJads/media/1565632553562.jpg\"></p><br>While\n I had ruthlessly gunned down roughly ten thousand angry aliens (read: \nsuccessfully kept my bitchin' job as Space President For Life) there was\n still the problem of finding the<br>Judases in my administration. Since\n I didn't really know who in my cabinet had supported the coup attempt I\n had no choice but to drain the space swamp entirely. So after a quick \nseries<br>of executions Soviet-style I got to work appointing my new \ncabinet. Some nerd who called himself my chief advisor tried to get me \nto hire the most intelligent minds in the known<br>universe, but he was a\n fuckin' nerd so I ignored his advice and had him ruthlessly wedgied to \ndeath. Then I high fived my newly created robot death squad which \nfucking hurt because<br>they're robots so I had them execute themselves \nand then I had the boys in space-manufacturing whip up a new robot death\n squad; this time with specially-engineered high-five technology.<br><br>Up\n next on the agenda was to learn the history of the Galactic Empire. \nNaturally it went in one ear and out the other. But after that I got to \nlearn all the highest level secrets a highly<br>advanced Type-III \ncivilization had at it's disposal. I learned about bigfoots being a \nsuper-race of ape-beasts that once spanned the world but are now largely\n thought to be extinct, which<br>is fucking metal. I learned about the \ngiant alien mass of tentacles at the center of the universe that will \nslowly consume us all in it's terrifying, matter-deleting beak, which is\n fucking<br>metal. I learned about the way the great space wizard \ndictacted all weather on Thunaria five, the planet of eternal Viking \ncannibal babes, which is fucking metal. And oh yeah, this little<br>green space nigga taught me the secret of what happens after death. Which is fucking metal.<br><br>Not metal was the way I noticed the quantum revolver hidden up his sleeve. <br>\"I believe you, Assistant to the Great Space Leader, Xygagg of Nomulon.\"<br><br>Before he could draw his gun I had drawn mine, blasting him between his four beady yellow eyes.<br><br>\"But I don't trust you.\"<br><br>Now\n with the secret cabal of traitors fully taken care of (probably) all \nthat was left to do was hire on a new team of crack politicians. \nUnfortunately I couldn't remember any of the <br>people that nerd \nrecommended and I wouldn't hire them anyway because they sound like \nnerds too. This meant I had to go with the B-team. Except I didn't \nreally have a B-team so instead I <br>decided to go see if Sophie and \nthe twins were cool with ditching Colombia for a kick-ass space \nadventure! I left Kid behind to handle running my space-dictatorship \nbecause if watching <br>Vice's North Korea documentaries has taught me anything it's that you always keep power in the family.<br><br>And\n speaking of keeping things in the family, part of why I left my \nflat-chested (yet admittedly way hotter and tighter) little sister at \nhome was so I could take a few extra days to<br>bang Soph before Kid has\n the chance to get jealous of her ridiculously massive tits and try to \nkill her because literally every girlfriend I have ever had since the \nday that little<br>psycho was born ended up dead under very suspicious \ncircumstances. So I take a ship down to Earth, managing to choke back \nthe vomit once I made it out of hyperspace. Figuring I'd find<br>her exactly where we'd left off, I landed in the backyard of whatever passes for the White House in Colombia.<br><br>\"No no no no!\" Alejandro shouted, \"Not my herb garden!\"<br><br>\"Fuck your herb garden!\" Daniel cried out in agony, \"What about my fucking weed?!\"<br><br>Sofi came up and slapped both of them across the back of the head.<br>\"Aye dios mio! We make first contact with alien life and this is what you're worried about?\"<br><br>\"Is\n that what you're calling me now?\" I inquired sarcastically over the \nship's loudspeaker, \"Less than a few months ago it was 'daddy'.\"<br><br>\"You\n have got to be kidding me.\" They all groaned in unison as I opened the \nhatch and extended my hand to help them in, \"Now let's go we've got a \ngalaxy to rule.\"<br><br>The three of them stood there, dumbfounded.<br>\"I'm sorry, what?\"<br><br><br><u><b>Chapter Eleven - Star Trip</b></u><br><br><br>We\n probably would have made it to the Star-Base where Kid was if it wasn't\n for two things. One, I didn't understand which of the alien scribbles \nmeant \"Autopilot\". And two, the alien who<br>landed in our backyard was \napparently smuggling an assload of space-drugs on account of the massive\n amount of space-LSD that I found onboard. After a breif bender we found\n ourselves in a<br>little bit of a pickle. And by little I meant little \nlike Tom Cruise. As in Scientology. As in a fleet of twelve \nScientologist space-747's surrounding us.<br><br>Yes, it would seem we found out where L. Ron Hubbard disappeared to.<br><br>---<br><br>\"Surrender the UFO\" L. Ron Hubbard demanded over the monitor, \"and face death!\"<br><br>\"Umm... No?\" I told the stubby ginger ball of lard, \"Because why the fuck would we do either of those things?\"<br><br>\"REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\"<br><br>With\n an autistic screech fueled by his autism and rage fueled by \namphetamines, L. Ron Hubbard ordered his fleet of space-747s to fire \ntheir laser weapons. This did surprisingly little to<br>damage the hull \nof our ship and, despite not understanding the language, I definitely \nunderstood the universal symbol for fuckin' shit up - the big red \nbutton.<br><br>\"Uh... Fire?\"<br><br>Anticlimactically pressing the big \nred button, I watched as a shock wave of plasma energy rippled out from \neach direction of the hull, immediately liquifying the golden 747's that\n were<br>somehow the airplane Xenu flies despite not being invented when\n he supposedly did this? It's fucking crazy man and you've been reading \nthis garbage. Fuck.<br><br>Fuck.<br><br>Okay, so it turned out L. Ron \nHubbard wasn't even on that ship which was lame but I get it. Smart \nmove. Fuck, I'll give it to him. He did it right. And now they totally \nstarted a war with <br>our galactic empire which I thought was the \n*only* galactic empire but no there's like fucking five of these things \nAND TO TOP IT OFF this motherfucker made the beef personal and said he<br>was gonna kill me and my entire dictator family which is TOTAL RAPE but whatever.<br><br>Fuck I hate Scientology.<br><br>---<br><br>\"What\n the fuck did you do?!\" the familiar voice from the very familiar back \nof her head shouted out at me on the comscreen, \"There are Tom Cruise \nliterally everywhere!\"<br><br>\"First, the plural is Tom Cruises.\" I began, \"Second, what?\"<br><br>\"Clones!\" She shouted, punctuating each word with a plasma weapon discharge, \"So! Many! Tom! Cruise! Clones!\"<br><br>Breathing heavily, Kid slouched down beside the monitor.<br>\"That's the last wave for now. Get over here, fast. I don't think I can keep them back for much longer.\"<br><br>The transmission ended and Alejandro slammed his fist down on the dashboard.<br><br>\"DAMN IT! Let's go save our cousin!\"<br><br>I shot him a \"you're being very unchill look\".<br><br>\"Dude, she's fine.\" I explained, \"We go through shit like this at least once a week.\"<br><br>\"Yeah,\" Daniel pointed out, \"Together.\"<br><br>\"Oh fuck.\" I dropped my joint as I went slackjaw, \"LET'S GO SAVE MY SISTER!\"<br><br>Hitting\n the big red button directly next to the other big red button we lurched\n into hyperdrive. Once we arrived back at the Space Base we immediately \nslammed into like five Sea Org space<br>747's that were clustered like, \nway too close together for no good reason. So we plowed through them and\n shot a few others down like super easily becuase 747s are the most \nretarded vehicle<br>for any kind of battle much less motherfucking space battle so... yeah.<br><br>We\n docked and boarded, murdering a few dozen scientology enforcer bots on \nthe way to the primary quantum supercomputations room which was like a \nserver room but gigantic, dimly lit, and<br>built like a maze for no \ngood reason. We took a quadrangle formation and made our way through the\n creepy maze of blinking lights and towering, humming server racks. A \ncouple of times I<br>swear I saw a cat-like figure leap through the corridors and I was certain it w-<br><br>Kid\n screamed like a banshee as she prepared to plunge a knife she had \nprobably made from a sharpened femur from one of the dead Tom Cruise \nclones.<br>\"DIE SCIENTOLOGY SCUM!\"<br><br>\"nonononowaitKidit'sme!\"<br><br>\"Ace!\" Kid wept tears of joy as she outstretched her free arm for a hug, \"WHO THE FUCK IS THIS BIG TITTED BIMBO!\"<br><br>Rather\n than hug me, Kid pimp slapped the fuck out of me. And as I saw stars in\n my field of vision Alejandro and Daniel pulled the two thots away from \neach other.<br><br>\"Look, I don't have time to jack it to a catfight \nright now.\" I explained, \"So let's just work together and kill these \nscientologists.\"<br><br>After a brief pause I added,<br>\"And then please do fight because my dick is diamonds right now.\"<br><br>---<br><br>\"Fan\n out!\" the real L. Ron Hubbard instructed his Tom Cruise clone-soldiers \nas they stormed Space Base 2069, \"I won't rest until each one of these \nAshtrays gets tone-40'd into suicide.\"<br><br>\"Sir yes sir!\" The Tom Cruise clone soldiers echoed, \"I suck so many fat cocks Penelope left me.\"<br><br>\"Yes,\" L. Ron Hubbard chuckled to himself, \"Yes you do.\"<br><br>Watching\n it from the terminal access unit we hacked into somehow (apparently Kid\n is a secret nerd or something because she actually fucking bothered to \nlearn this dumb alien language) and<br>controlling the surveillance \ncameras we were able to determine the Scientologists would find their \nway to us within no time at all. Overlooking the server maze on the \nobservation platform,<br>L. Ron Hubbard lorded over the battle, \nmenacingly. His Tom Cruise clones entered the maze from all six points \nof access, leaving us no course of action but to fight.<br><br>\"I don't \nsuppose this is the part where we find out we have secret superpowers?\" \nKid joked, laughing nervously, \"Or something like that?\"<br><br>\"No.\" I growled, \"This is the part where we kick some ass.\"<br><br><p>---</p><p><br></p>We\n stood there, surrounded by the corpses of hundreds of dead Tom Cruises.\n Alejandro and Daniel had shapeshifted into massive white wolves, the \nformer with deep crimson markings dyed into his fur in the style of a \nbaseball player's eye black, with a deep crimson dot on his forehead, \nwhile the latter had a deep cerulean blue crescent moon on it's forehead\n and blue around it's eyes. Sofi was holding an entire server rack above\n her head with one hand like it was fucking nothing. Kid was hovering \nlike a foot off the ground and the tips of her normally straw blonde \nhair were glowing pink and blue while her hands were emitting almost \nultraviolet globs of fluctuating translucent energy, and I was tossing \nand catching a ball of searing hot blue fire in the air like a fucking \nbadass.<br><br>L. Ron Hubbard stomped his foot in frustration, \"Oh you have got to be fucking kidding me!\"<br><br>Kid teleported us to the observation platform and blocked L. Ron's escape.<br><br>\"Hail Xenu, bitch.\"<br><br>\"Ohfucknotintheface-\"<br><br>---<br><br>Flying\n back to Earth in the UFO, Kid used her telekinesis to pass the bong to \nme, while I lit the weed so we could all get lit. I mean come on, yeah \nwe killed L. Ron Hubbard and basically destroyed two massive space \nempires in a single weekend but also we're stoners with very low \nattention spans and that just isn't compatible with being superheroes. \nSophie and the twins had opted to stay behind and help rebuild the space\n empire, and since the CIA had installed some puppet dictator into \noffice in Colombia we just decided to go back home. The toilet gimp was \nback for work and I hadn't taken a piss since I found out they outlawed \nthem in Space Base after the Bath House Act of 4200 ZK. Naturally he was\n very pleased to have come back to work when he had and I was about four\n gallons lighter. Everything is cool for a change. Kid's in her room \nmaking bank on her private Snapchat, I'm getting high on the couch \npaying my little sister to stick a sharpie up her ass under the \npseudonym \"xxDigBic69xx\" and I'm watching Gordon Ramsey yell at grown \nmen until they cry.<br><br>Shit's finally back to normal.<br><br><b>Chapter Twelve - 9001 1337 Street Suite 420 Floor 69</b><br><br>Shit\n was clearly not back to normal because why the fuck would shit ever be \nnormal for us? Almost immediately after we got settled back in we both \ngot a text from an unknown number.<br><br>&gt; Run.<br><br>&gt; Now.<br><br>Naturally\n we had each elected to leap out the nearest window and to our credit, \nlistening to the mysterious text messages turned out to be the right \ncall because as soon as we had begun scrambling towards the ocean my \ngoddamn beach house got blown up in what could only be a targeted act of\n terror courtesy of Turkmenistan's most notorious terrorist group, \nFundamentalist Athiest Resistance Team; A.K.A. F.A.R.T.<br><br>But we \nknew we couldn't defeat FART alone, so Kid and I teamed up with an \nexpert in Turkmenistani terrorist cells by the name of Phreak Sh0w. Or \nwe would have if he didn't die from a deadly F.A.R.T. assassination. It \nwas totally bullshit.<br><br>\"So,\" Kid declared as we stood before the \nburnt down apartment buildings where Phreak Sh0w had been murdered, \n\"It's come to this.\"<br><br>\"Yup.\" I agreed, cloaking myself in a brilliant cerulean burst of flames, \"Time to fight fire with fire.\"<br><br>---<br><br>We\n didn't want to be costumed terrorists, but the Turkmenistani FART is \nnotoriously difficult to track down. That meant the only way to find the\n FART was to draw them out of hiding. We had found out about their<br>protection\n racket from an email Phreak Sh0w had set to go out to us should he die \nbefore he could assist us in tracking FART down. It told us about three \nmultiethnic grocery stores in the little Turkmenistan district<br>of Des\n Moines, Iowa that may have also doubled as a secret FART rendezvous \npoint. After a quick Greyhound ride Kid and I were finally in Des \nMoines' scenic Little Turkmenistan district, where we wasted no time \nterrorizing the little grocery store to see which of it's occupants were\n actually secret assassins who would stop our terrorizing.<br><br>Holding\n a tank of propane in one hand and Kid's hand in the other, she \nlevitated us inside the store (menacingly) and as the rubes inside \nstared at us in wonder and awe I flung the propane tank into a crowd and\n chased it with a fireball. KABOOM! Screaming filled the store as \nshrapnel from the tank slaughtered thirteen Turkmenistani FOBs who had \nbeen babbling in some foreign gookish tongue. Meanwhile Kid used her \ntelekinesis to draw a swarm of grocery carts into the main (and only) \nentrance to the store, colliding with the crowd of terrified people who \nwere probably thinking we were some kind of vengeful gods. Because \nthey're from Turkmenistan and therefore they have primitive reasoning \nlike that.<br><br>Suck it, Turkmenistan.<br><br>Suck it like your mother sucks it.<br><br>And\n sure enough, our little venture into domestic hate crimes and costumed \nterrorism drew out five Fundamentalist Athiest Resistance Team members. I\n was about to turn them all into ash when I heard Kid in my head with \nher telepathy.<br><br>\"Wait.\" her voice echoed in my head, \"I recognize one of them.\"<br><br>As\n soon as she thought it, the second of the five ninjas' eyes narrowed as\n his pupils darted from target to target. Faster than his gaze, his \nhands had already slain the two ninja nearest him. And no sooner had the<br>remaining\n pair of ninja recognized the traitor in their midst before they too \nwere slain by errant kunai. Stepping forward and taking off his mask we \nwere greeted by the smiling face of Phreak Sh0w himself. Somehow he \ncheated death I guess. I dunno. I stopped calling bullshit on life a \nlong time ago.<br><br>\"Phreak Sh0w!\" Kid cried, happy to see the close family friend we literally never mentioned until this point, \"You're alive!\"<br><br>\"No Kid,\" he replied, \"I'm actually his twin brother, Black H@.\"<br><br>\"Wow! I heard that as the 'at' symbol!\"<br><br>\"Yeah how did you do that?\" I asked.<br><br>Black H@ dabbed for dramatic effect, \"with hacking, bro.\"<br><br>All\n of a sudden a flurry of binary ones and zeroes manifested around us, \ndigitizing us into the virtual world where the Turkmenistani freedom \nfighter faction known as the Fundamentalist Athiest Resistance Team's \nreal base of action was located.<br><br>\"Whoa!\" I exclaimed, surprised by my low-poly avatar and the Tron-like grid pattern beneath my feet, \"What did you do?!\"<br><br>\"Simple,\" Black H@ humblebragged as he pushed his glasses back into place, \"I hacked us into the internet.\"<br><br>Almost\n as soon as he said that, Black H@ was blasted by a virtual mecha dragon\n and lost all his hit points. As he demanifested into a series of ones \nand zeroes, doomed to a fate far worse than death, Kid and I<br>summoned\n our virtual weapons and slew the mecha dragon, charging the cyberspace \ncompound where the Turkmenistani F.A.R.T. had gathered for a company \nFortnite session.<br><br>We stormed the compound and blasted apart force\n fields, virtual avatars of ragtag adventurers, and Ralph, who wouldn't \nleave. By the time we had slain every last Turkmeni FART agent it was \ntime for my midday beer and Kid was starting to go through withdrawals. \nIt had suddenly dawned on us we had no idea how to get out of there.<br><br>\"I don't suppose Phreak Sh0w or Black H@ were actually triplets right?\"<br><br>\"Not even this dumpster fire of an excuse for a story would do _that_ big of a cop out.\"<br><br>---<br><br>Next\n thing we knew, Kid, me, 0verClock me, and the Penguin from the General \nauto insurance commercials were all in front of the crater where my \nfucking house used to be.<br><br>\"Oh goddamn it.\"<br><br>\"So where are you gonna go now?\" Kid asked 0verClock.<br><br>\"There are still rogue FARTs out there.\"<br><br>Kid snickered.<br><br>\"Yeah I bet there are.\"<br><br>\"I'm off to avenge my brothers!\"<br><br>With a seig heil motion 0verClock hacked himself to Nepal to fight the giant yeti FARTs of Sation V.<br><br>\"I still can't believe they were triplets.\" The me from 5 days ago remarked.<br><br>\"I still can't believe he autotuned his voice.\" I griped, \"Lucky motherfucker sounds like he ate T-Pain.\"<br><br>\"You guys wanna get high?\" The penguin asked.<br><br>\"Holy shit,\" Kid yelped, \"you can talk?\"<br><br>\"Oh every penguin can.\"<br><br>\"K.\"<br><br>\"Also yes.\"<br><br>\"Yes we do.\"<br><br><b>Chapter Thirteen - We Are Number One But With Giant Space Boobs</b><br><br>Since\n my bullshit insurance company apparently doesn't cover rocket launcher \nattacks (which is hella gay) I was forced to turn to family for shelter.\n Also the police kept calling saying I was wanted for questioning in<br>the\n murder case of someone named Dominica? I have no idea what that's about\n but I really hope they catch whatever lunatic did it. So it came as a \nsurprise when I showed up to Space Base 2069 with my ship full of \nheroin, pot, meth, blow, hooch, mescaline, DMT, MDMA, LSD, and a vial of\n Euphoria - the made up drug from 90210 stuffed up my ass. And if I'm \nbeing honest that's probably why we ended up detained by Space Customs \nand Immigration. Which was weird because as I repeatedly screamed at \nSofi, we literally owned the place.<br><br>\"I told you a hundred times already,\" Sofi growled, frustrated, \"This is a democracy now.\"<br><br>\"Since when?!\"<br><br>\"Since they voted on it.\"<br><br>\"That's not how a dictatorship works!\"<br><br>Sofi\n blinked, suddenly realizing we had basically become dictators in exile \non account of the fact that my idiot cousins don't understand how a \ndictatorship works. Luckily we were able to join the legions of<br>scientists\n and weapons engineers who suddenly weren't millionaires after democracy\n allocated funding to other fields like decommissioning the Famine Mines\n of Garbaxi-B and restoring road infrastructure. As the<br>de-facto heads of the pro-dictatorship anti-democracy resistance force we had to take on an armada of drones.<br><br>Turned\n out going up against an entire army of drone robots weilding military \ngrade plasma weapons is actually a pretty bad idea when all you have are\n AKs and a bunch of LSD. So we picked an easier place to conquer: \nColombia.<br><br>The first attempt to take power back didn't work out to\n well on account of the fact that the CIA plant they put in power wrote \nout the law that says anyone who kills the previous president \nautomatically becomes<br>president. So our backup plan was to join a \nrevolutionary group laying low in the vast rainforest that encompasses \nthe Colombian wilderness. And that's how the five of us found ourselves \ngetting shitfaced on bottle after filthy bottle of illegally distilled \ntequila with various large bugs taken from around the rainforest jammed \nup inside them. And nothing psychs you up for a revolution more than \ntripping balls off five bottles of mexican shine and whatever exotic \npsychedelic chemicals were in the centipede from bottle number three. \nNext thing I know we're storming the capitol with the help of the \nVietnamese White Nationalists (don't ask) and after a brief period of \nhaving to explain to a bunch of rice farming gooks in Klan hoods why you\n don't rape until AFTER you have control of the capitol we finally \nmanaged to shell the palace and take control of the entire country.<br><br>And\n the first order of business was to rebuild the palace. I wasn't about \nto be a cruel and eccentric dictator with two completely blown-up homes.\n Naturally I decided to make it entirely out of Obsidian and made it \nlook totally metal. Like a combination of whatever kind of castle the \ndevil would buttfuck hitler in and some techno-corporate dystopian mega \nskyscraper. This thing was massive, brutalist, and looked totally evil.<br><br>Next\n order of business was to make the rest of the city match. I wasn't \nabout to stick out like a sore thumb, there's a homeowners association \ngoddamn it! So I had literally the entire national funding cut and \nslashed in favor of making a capitol city that looks like something out \nof Metalocalypse. Naturally this led to another revolution trying to \ntopple my regime but the joke's on them because if there's one thing I \nlearned from nearly dying in space by plasma drone strike it's that \nscientists and armies are a dictator's best friend. And if there's one \nthing I learned from North Korea it's that having nukes stops you from \nbecoming America's next forever war.<br><br>Naturally I proceeded to \nskip straight past armies and scientists and plowed the nation into \ncrippling debt to fund the development of AI scientists and \nplama-weilding superbots that would significantly reduce our<br>need to \nentertain the notion of sanity and stability required to run a \ndictatorship. We also had a sudden liberation from debt on account of \nthe fact that nobody wants to argue with the guy who has an army of \ndeath bots weilding plasma weapons and neutrino grenades. Lastly, I \nrelocated the capitol building to the top of an artificial mountain I \nhad constructed in the middle of the rainforest. I also had a massive \nfifty lane highway paved through a huge swath of the rainforest and \nlined the sides of that road with the skulls of the natives we mowed \ndown to pave it. I'm pretty sure that thing is haunted too because every\n last construction worker who built it died mysteriously. Well, it's not\n really a mystery after that one guy's dash cam caught the reflection of\n an indian ghost in the back of his car choking him out and causing him \nto veer off the road and have a lethal collision.<br><br>I know what \nyou're thinking and no it's not like that. This ghost is actually \ntotally unrelated. Not native-Colombian indian, I mean indian like dot \nnot feather. I think this might actually be the ghost of the tech<br>support\n guy I had sacrificed after the road was built so that I could ensure \nthe fibre optic lines I had put in (what, am I just going to not have \ninternet at my capitol built on top of a man made mountain in the<br>middle of the rainforest? Come on.) would never experience any connection issues.<br><br>Also\n if you don't mind the fact that the radio occasionally picks up the \nsignal of the tech support guy screaming profanities about your mother \nor the fact that any call to On-Star made while driving down that road \ngets rerouted to the plane between worlds where the tech support ghost's\n soul eternally suffers then you should really drive that highway \nbecause it's absolutely beautiful and you can totally see my giant evil \ncastle looming over the horizon the entire drive there. Space-Base 2069 \nSo that was all well and good but it turns out there's actually a lot \nmore to being a tyrannical dictator than just building weapons of mass \ndestruction and relocating your palace to some completely asinine \nlocation way out in the middle of nowhere. You also need to decide what \nremote villaiges should starve, what ethnic or religious groups need a \ngood cleansing, and someone to cook up some quality propaganda to be \nheard by everyone in Colombia at threat of death. So basically, that \nmeant Sofi was in charge of starvation Alejandro and Daniel were on team\n make-me-look-way-more-competant-than-I'm-acually-not, and Kid was in \ncharge of the ethnic cleansing which was perfect because she already had\n our six foot four inch great grandpa's SS-officer suit tailored down to\n fit her four foot ten, stick thin frame. Actually that wasn't even in \nanticipation of her appointment, she had gotten that altered back before\n we even left for Space-Base 2069. I think she just wanted to wear it \nfor shock value or something. Either way, she did an excellent job of \ngetting rid of the goddamn Hondurans plaguing our ethnically diverse \nnation. There is no fucking room for any goddamn Hondurans in my fascist\n south american dictatorship goddamn it!<br><br>Alejandro and Daniel \nwere doing a great job with the propaganda department to be honest. I \nmean, I wasn't expecting them to but people were actually coming on \nboard with the idea of me inventing golf and me being the first man on \nmars. And I got to hand it to them, it's pretty hard to be a free press \nwhen there's a ten foot tall Free Speech Sentinal bot two feet to your \nright ready to plasma blast you into fine mist of atomized blood vapor. \nWe killed anyone who opposed us and Sofi was doing a great job of mining\n starvation, which she assured me was a thing you could do. I didn't \nbelieve her because all the meth I had to take to keep up with actually \nputting the work into running my country effectively had me paranoid I \nwas being betrayed by everyone I knew and loved in this world, so I \ncalled up my new buddy Kim Jong Un and he assured me it was absolutely a\n thing you could do. So that ended that fit of paranoia for at least \nfour or five hours.<br><br>But I was still concerned some idiot was out \nto get me. I was constantly looking over my shoulder, checking the \npalace security tapes for proof that my diarrhea was the result of a \ncovert assassination attempt and not the result of the literal grams of \npure methamphetamine I was shoveling down my mouth hole every day. And \nironically I actually did discover an assassination attempt on my life.<br><br>And it was by none other than the most insidious nazi bitch I ever encountered.<br><br><b>Chapter Fourteen - Dominica's Revenge: Part One: O' Janitor, Won't You Clean My Sins?</b><br><br>I had never seen anything like it.<br><br>Everything\n I loved. Everything I had worked for. All the wealth I robbed this \nnation of! Gone! I felt so jewed by this Nazi secret agent asshole! Who \neven was she?!<br><br>\"I was the clone of the woman you murdered sent back in time to the year 2069 to ensure that someone stops you!\"<br><br>\"That\n makes no fucking sense!\" I shouted, \"I have suspended a lot of \ndisbelief reading my own story but this is fucking ridiculous.\"<br><br>\"...\n You took over a foreign government three separate times with zero \ncasualties in the space of a handful of hours and this right here? \n_This_ is where you draw the line?\"<br><br>\"I mean...\"<br><br>\"Yeah.\"<br><br>\"Fuck.\"<br><br>\"Total bullshit right?\"<br><br>\"What? No!

I refuse to listen to you brag about \nsomething that, were it a work of fiction, would be no more legible than\n the lunatic ramblings of a schizophrenic homeless man wearing a tin \nfoil hat and pants soaked in urine!\"<br><br>\"Those are the _best kind_ of stories!\"<br><br>\"I hate you with the burning passion of a million suns.\"<br><br>\"I hate me too and that's what makes me a relatable, dare I say lovable asshole!\"<br><br>\"I refuse to demean myself to whatever masochistic fucks are reading this.\" She explained, \"I choose death!\"<br><br>As\n I watched the clone of a woman I murdered commit suicide in an \nunexpected existential crisis, I began to wonder how I let my life get \nthis totally badass.<br><br><br>~~~<br><br>*Two weeks earlier* _inside of my fucking metal mountain castle_<br><br>\"what\n the fuck is this?\" Sofi demanded in the reflection of the glass case \nsurrounding my priceless faberge egg, \"And why did we have to reassign \n1300 famine miners to do actual work?\"<br><br>\"Because, dear cousin,\" I \nexplained, slightly more pedantic now that I had an otherwise useless \nstatus symbol telling anyone I bragged to about my pants-on-head \nretarded levels of wealth,\"I needed them to mine for gold so I could \nafford to pay off the loan I used to buy _this_ work of wonder.\"<br><br>I gestured to the only black faberge egg, crafted during his experimental goth phase.<br><br>\"You are a fucking idiot.\" Sofi explained, \"Faberge didn't have a goth phase.\"<br><br>\"Oh.\" I blinked, \"That would explain the ticking.\"<br><br>\"The what?\"<br><br>KA-BOOM!<br><br>Two\n things happened to me in that moment. I saw the ruins of my once \ntotally bitchin palace crumble before me, and I watched as my little \nsister was sliced diagonally in t wain by a giant piece of shattered \nobsidian castle wall.<br><br>And in that moment a part of me died for the first time.<br><br>---<br><br>Coming\n to in what I at first mistakenly assumed was a sex dungeon of my own \ndesign, the presence of medical equipment that was actually st*erile and\n not covered in spunk was a pretty good cue in that I was in the totally\n black metal hospital bed of the capitol city I had nearly bankrupted \nColombia for in the process of making it all look totally fucking metal.\n Ripping the IVs out of my body I stood up, only to find my entire lower\n half was making that weird hydraulic noise cyborgs make and to my \nhorror I glanced down and saw my legs - or what had become of them - \nfused with the very machinery that now filled the void left by the fire \nthat was started from the assassination attempt in my faberge egg room \nwhich was conveniently located next to my room full of canned gasoline \nand my room full of nitroglycerine stockpiles.<br><br>I screamed, and as\n the nurses rushed in in their skimpy, all black corset panty combos, I \nhit them and watched as they were flung into the wall. My every step \nburned as a result of the exposed flesh and that was when I saw it. A \nsuit made of my own skin - or something designed to emulate it \nperfectly. I found it was stretchy like rubber and form-fitted to my \nevery curve and crevice. I was slightly less horrified about what had \nbecome of me and officially ready to hunt down that rogue assassin who \nwas giving me food poisoning. She would totally flip if she knew I had \nbecome a fucking terminator. This is gonna be so fucking awesome!<br><br>But\n even as a cyborg I couldn't face down what I now understood to be a \ntime nazi alone. I would need the help of someone just as badass as me. \nAnd since Sofi and the twins were dead or missing (whichever, I never \nbothered to actually check tbh) I was left with one option.<br><br>\"Is \nthis her?\" I asked, staring down at the frankensteined together halves \nof my tween sister's bare, flat, and freckled chest, \"I mean all of \nher?\"<br><br>The mortician did a jack off motion behind my back, \"Yes, your exhaltedness.\"<br><br>\"And are you aware I can see your reflection, Mortimer?\"<br><br>\"My name isn't m-\"<br><br>I shot the disrespectful guy who was <i>definitely</i> named Mortimer with my gold plated 28 special.<br><br>\"Sofi,\n make sure this guy's family gets sent to th-\" I began, realizing I \nstill had no idea if she was alive or dead, \"Oh right.\"<br><br>Shrugging,\n I dragged my little sister's lifeless corpse to the ruins of the castle\n where she died, and I spent hours using my newfound cyborg \nsuper-strength to clear away pile after giant slab of rubble until at \nlast<br>a twenty-something foot circular area had been cleared away to \nmake room for what was about to be the craziest thing I ever tried.<br><br>But I know it'll work.<br><br>I saw it happen on an anime.<br><br>---<br><br>Back\n in our old palace, I set about making sure everything was ready to trap\n the would-be time traveller nazi assassin so I could interrogate her \nand execute her, possibly not in that order since I basically fullmetal \nalchemist'd my way into having a little sister again. Just one problem, \nshe still had that stitched together scar which I guess made her look \nlike an anime character too? I dunno man I'm not the weeb writing this \ntrash.<br><br>Anyway, she dyed her hair black (eyebrows too) which was \nkinda cool. I guess to get revenge or whatever? Symbolize a new chapter \nin our lives? All I know is nothing has really changed. We cheat death \nlike every other day, even if it's just by avoiding a heroin OD for the \nmillionth time. Seriously, I'm sure Sofi and Alejandro and the other one\n are probably just fine, they'll probably be reintroduced in half two \nand be super mad at me just watch.<br><br>\"Are you ready?\"<br><br>\"As I'll ever be.\"<br><br>\"Are you going emo now or some shit?\"<br><br>\"I'm twelve.\" Kid snarked, \"Not retarded.\"<br><br>\"Alright, that's fair.\"<br><br>\"Wait,\"\n Kid noticed, pointing at a fluctuation on the security monitor, \"does \nthat ripple look like a haggard old mexican woman to you?\"<br><br>I had flashbacks to the nazi spy I murdered while high off my ass on PCP. \"Nyoh my god.\"<br><br>\"Dominica.\" Kid snarled, \"She's back.\"<br><br>\"Yes, I-\" I started, \"Wait how did you know about Dominica?\"<br><br>\"I caught her digging through our trash trying to find out where you worked.\"<br><br>\"And you didn't tell me until just now because?\"<br><br>\"Because I got high, bro.\"<br><br>\"You know what, that's actually okay with me.\"<br><br>\"So what's the plan?\"<br><br>\"Well...\"<br><br>---<br><br>\"... And then we spring the trap on her before she gets near us.\"<br><br>\"Sounds easy.\" Kid agreed.<br><br>\"One problem.\" A voice in the wind pointed out.<br><br>Dominica deactivated her Chamelion suit and pointed a gun at us.<br><br>\"History\n says you two die in that explosion.\" She explained, \"I don't know what \nkind of horrible things you do to make even _the Nazis_ want you dead \nand I don't care. All I know is, you and girl-Hitler over there<br>cause the future to be a dystopian sci-fi nightmare.\"<br><br>She\n drew a badass gunsmoke grey samurai sword with a glowing red stripe \nalong it's blade, \"So I'm going to make sure and correct it!\"<br><br>I looked at Kid, who looked at me.<br><br>We\n both pulled our guns but apparently she could block bullets which is so\n bullshit but whatever I guess. So she takes us hostage which is such \nfucking bullshit, man! And we end up back where we started in the<br>wreckage of some insane castle I had dreamt up in a fever dream on cocaine.<br><br>~~~<br><br>So\n with the story having come full circle I had one last thing to take \ncare of. If history said I was supposed to die there, who fucked with it\n to make Kid and I the way we were?<br><br>I mean, I know why Kid was \nthe way she was. I basically ripped off Full Metal Alchemist just to \nbring her back, but me? Who used their future-y cyborg tech to bring me \nback? Was it the Russians? The Illuminati? The fucking FEEB?!<br><br>That\n was when I remembered everything. My memory came back. I had come to \nbriefly, as the paramedics were trying to finish me off for sending \ntheir families to the famine mines.<br><br>A flash of light and there he was.<br><br>Future me.<br><br><b>Chapter Fifteen - Dominica's Revenge Part Two: So It's Come To This</b><br><br>Now I know what you're thinking. If I was dead how did future me come back to save me?<br><br>Well,\n I saw the scar on my - his - arm where he burned himself with a \nlighter. A lighter that the me from the past from that one time a few \nchapters ago had used to get high as fuck bro. Clearly he had killed the\n real Dominica and the one from the time with the PCP cigarettes was a \nclone just like the one who killed herself. And if I knew anything about\n my own life it's that the me from the past probably went into the \nfuture to go back to the past and inject me with nano-robots that would \nsave my life by turning what was left of my exploded up corpse into the \nbitchin' awesome super cyborg you see before you.<br><br>And if there \nwas anything else I knew about myself it's that if I was a time clone \nwho knew I wouldn't let me live then I would totally hide in India.

So I took the time travel device off of<br>the lifeless corpse of the second dominica clone and grabbed Kid by the waist.<br><br>She gave me a worried look. \"Ace, what are you doing?\"<br><br>\"Tying up a loose end.\" I said as I cocked my sawed off plasma-shotgun.<br><br>A\n cloak of blinding green light enveloped us and we were warped into the \nfuture.

Children with glowing tribal \nmarkings and cybernetic organs ran amok around the agrav train's cabin, \nand a man with wires and pipes running from his back to his brain split \ninto two people so one could act as his own footrest.<br><br>Kid's jaw dropped. \"What the fuck did you do?\"<br><br>---<br><br>Making\n our way through the dense under-layer of the massive skyscrapers \ntowering around us, so tightly grouped that we assumed it was one in the\n morning or something, the only light showing us how bizarre humanity \nhad become was that of the refreshingly old-school neon signs that were \nprobably just there for that aesthetic cyberpunk glow.<br><br>We figured\n the best place to look for me from the past in the future was in \nwhatever bar was the diviest and sleaziest...

Surprisingly, we actually found him at one of the higher end bars\n with that comfortingly aesthetic pink and blue neon glow.<br><br>\"I knew you'd find me eventually.\" He sipped some glowing green drink, \"Come here to tie up loose ends?\"<br><br>\"No.\" I answered, slamming a pair of severed ears down on the bar in front of him, \"I came to let you know you're safe.\"<br><br>\"I believe you.\"<br><br>Before he could finish with an \"But I don't trust you.\" I pulled out my plasma blaster and liquified him.<br><br>\"Nice try, motherfucker!\"<br><br>A pair of space-credit tokens fell to the floor, and it occurred to me that maybe I was planning on just buying myself a drink.<br><br>Oh well.<br><br>Realizing\n we never even bothered to check if we had enough time-fuel, Kid and I \ndiscovered we were basically trapped in the future until we could \nfuture-Bonnie and cyber-Clyde our way into buying an illegal time travel\n device on the Kameranian black market.<br><br>We stepped out of the \nelevator into the pristine hallway wearing pull-over masks that made our\n faces look like TV static and cocked our quantum SMGs.

Well, not really. Our feet just kind of \nclunked against the frosted blue glass and the doors slid open but if we\n had kicked them open it would have been cooler when we started \nshooting.<br><br>\"Get your hands on the fucking ground!\" Kid demanded, \"Nobody move!\"<br><br>\"Well which is it, sir?\"<br><br>\"That's m'aam to you!\"<br><br>Kid shot the guy and everyone immediately dropped to the floor.<br><br>\"Your money is insured!\" I explained, \"Or maybe it isn't.

Uh... _Informative._\"<br><br>\"Yes,\n now if you'll excuse me I have to leave you alone with our unguarded \nprosecutor and the room where the only proof of a crime occurring is \nkept unlocked.\"<br><br>\"Yeah we'll be here,\" I rolled my eyes, stuffing \nwads of newspaper into the filing cabinets and dousing them with lighter\n fluid as the AI demanifested, \"Just don't mind us.\"<br><br>\"Ready?\" Kid asked as she held up her lighter.<br><br>I held up mine as we hurried down the hall, trailing gasoline the whole way to the window. \"Let's blow this joint!\"<br><br>We\n kicked the windows out, totally nailing it this time, and jumped down \nto the neon blue and pink haze illuminating the clouds beneath us with a\n soft vaporwavey, 1980's glow.<br><br>Freefalling down the side of the \nbuilding at 180 floors and counting, I held Kid's hand and activated the\n parachute. We drifted down to the seedy underbelly of New Dehli 2420 \nand high fived as we touched down amid the surreal, studio-ghibli-esque \nassortment of bizarre alien life around us.<br><br><b>Chapter One: Same Shit Different Future</b><br><br>Hiding\n out in our futuristic apartment, Kid and I took turns taking massive \nbong rips. Weed in the future was something else, man. I swear it almost\n made me hallucinate this big ass nigga coming up and handing me this \ntablet thing right before I fell asleep.<br><br>And when I woke up my \ndumb ass had been so high I didn't even react to a dude literally \nbreaking into my house and leaving us a fucking tablet because of course\n that's what had fucking happened.<br><br>Fuck my life.<br><br>---<br><br>\"What's it say?\"<br><br>I pushed my sister's face away from mine, \"Cut it out! I'm about to find out!\"<br><br>I\n pressed what I assumed was the power button and desperately hoped \nwasn't a bomb. It was and thankfully we got a prerecorded message of \nmister black dude in tiny round shades like a matrix lookin ass bitch \ntelling us what's for. Turns out he was part of a secret society of high\n tech future assassins and we just murdered his next hit - Attourney-Bot\n General 9001-Xe.<br><br>\"So you see why we cannot allow you to live.\" \nhis recording explained, \"But we also wouldn't want to lose such \nvaluable assets. So we're giving you one chance to ammend your mistake \nand possibly even join the<br>Fraternity of Reapers.<br><br>\"Oh fuck yeah!\" I geeked out, still high as balls, \"We're gonna be future assassins!\"<br><br>\"That is so fucking dope.\" an equally high Kid exclaimed as she fist-bumped me.<br><br>We\n received the name of our next mark the following week and I was \nsurprised to find out it wasn't one of those tests that required us to \nkill each other if we wanted in and then we find out the guns we were \ngiven<br>were fake and it was all just to see if we'd sacrifice anything to work as an assassin team for the Reapers.<br><br>So\n naturally that was what we found out we had to do as soon as we got \nhome and found another tablet on the bed along with two guns.<br><br>\"... So you have your orders. I look forward to seeing which one of you prevails.\"<br><br>The tablet short circuited and Kid exchanged glances with me.<br><br>\"On three.\" I agreed.<br><br>She\n nodded and we both took a gun, our draw speeds equally matched as we \nsqueezed the triggers and felt a burning pain in between each of our \neyes.<br><br>The guns, it just so happened, were real.<br><br>---<br><br>What's\n weirder than almost dying and finding out you're still alive? Knowing \nit was because one of you is made of plot-armor magic and the other is a\n friggin nano-machine cyborg!<br><br>\"How fucking awesome was that!\"<br><br>\"We cheated death TWICE!\"<br><br>From\n behind us, the voice of a dude played by Samuel Jackson made it's \npresence known. \"And in doing so you're worthy of joining us.\"<br><br>\"It's Samuel L Jackson!\" I shouted!<br><br>\"Say English, Motherfucker!\" Kid begged, starstruck<br><br>\"What?\n No I'm- Look, you can55 call me Mad Dog. I'll be your handlers until \nyou're off probationary status. After a few kills you'll be full-fledged\n Reapers.\"<br><br>Me and Kid were practically bursting out of our skin and he sighed, acquiescing.<br><br>\"Motherfuckers.\"<br><br>We high fived and geeked out as he left shaking his head in sheer disbelief.<br><br>---<br><br>So\n a newly raven haired Kid and myself put on our best cyberpunk leather \nand glow stripe outfits and picked the coolest looking guns we could \nfind and set out to atomize someone named \"Sheik Furrah Maldamanalala\" \nwhich I have been repeatedly assured is a genuine Indian name in the \nyear 2420 (nice)<br><br>So we tried to track this dude down but nobody \nin the seedy Indian underbelly seemed to know where to find him. And \nthen we asked the board of directors if they could find some body and \nthey asked who and we told them and this guy just stands up and says \n\"uh... I'm Sheik Furrah Maldamanalala.\" And I look at the paper to \ntriple check if I got the right guy and sure enough it was totally him \nso Kid whipped out her plasma pistol and shot him five times in the \nchest.<br><br>Also since we couldn't leave any witnesses we killed our entire board of directors to boot.<br><br>---<br><br>\"What the fuck did you do?\" Sam Jackson demanded, \"You killed the entire board of directors?!\"<br><br>\"I mean... Yeah?\"<br><br>\"Our leader was on that board!\"<br><br>\"The shiek was our leader?\"<br><br>\"What? No! The other guy!\"<br><br>\"So what you're saying is, by highlander rules, Kid's now leader?\"<br><br>\"I- NO!\" He shouted, \"That's not how any of this works.\"<br><br>Kid pulled a gun on him.<br><br>\"I'm sorry, you were saying?\"<br><br>\"Hail the new leader!\"<br><br>\"That's what I thought.\"<br><p><br></p><p>---<br></p><p><br></p>So\n as the new leaders of the Reaper assassin clan I got totally high as \nfuck on future crack which was like regular crack but if crack fucked \nfentanyl and ass-raped mescaline. It makes you hard as fuck, too. I \nthink I must have jacked off like twenty-nine times that night. Sadly, \nwe didn't have much to be leader of as we would just then learn from a \nReaper on 1 HP that the Nazis were taking revenge for the death of their\n leader who, of fucking course, was on the board of directors we \nmassacred the other day. As he bled out on the floor in front of us, Kid\n and I turned our heads to face each other and giggled like idiots.<br><br>Just\n as Nazis busted in prepared to kill us (we literally could not defend \nourselves with how hard we were laughing, the dudes had hitler staches \nand our sides were in orbit) a flash of green light took us from the<br>future to what I could only assume was the present where my newly remodeled house had been paid off by my insurance.<br><br>\"What the fuck Sofi?!\" I demanded, apparently no longer high out of my mind, \"Do you know how hard I was tripping?!\"<br><br>\"Yeah what the fuck you sexy bitch?\"<br><br>\"I- Wh- We'll fuck later.\"<br><br>Kid pumped her fist. \"Aww yiss!\"<br><br>\"Hey what about me?\" I demanded.<br><br>\"Well you can start by thanking me for saving your lives.\"<br><br>\"News flash, dipshit!\" I shouted, \"We weren't about to die because things usually work out for us.\"<br><br>Sofi just stared at me with this face that screamed \"bitch, really?\"<br><br>\"Oh. Right.\" I realized, \"My bad.\"<br><br>Sofi\n shook her head and got back in the VTol to go back to Colombia where I \nguess she was gonna do an actually good job of being in charge of \npeople?<br><br>You know. If she doesn't let them vote her out of a job again.<br><br><b>Chapter Two - Ah Fuck My Life</b><br><br>Things looked like they were finally back to normal. For real this time.<br><br>No\n yeah I wasn't buying it either. Making my eggs just goes off without a \ngiant robot nazi interrupting me? Bullshit. Kid's playing with a clone \nof a sabertooth tiger that's also part alien and it _DOESN'T_ attack me?<br>Clearly I'm in a simulation or something. And to top it all off the mailman is tucking is lizard tail into his cargo shorts! A-<br><br>No.<br><br>Wait.<br><br>That... That's not right. Hol' up.<br><br>Hol' up.<br><br>Mailman.<br><br>Lizard tail.<br><br>Alien tiger.<br><br>Ah fuck.<br><br>The reptilians are back.<br><br>---<br><br>\"We have to get rid of it right now!\"<br><br>\"Why the fuck for?!\"<br><br>\"It belonged to the reptilians!\"<br><br>\"Then why the fuck did the Nazis want it?\"<br><br>All\n of a sudden we saw the tiger changing the channels telepathically to \nFox, where they were marathoning the Nuremburg Rally, and we saw the \nwhite tiger longingly seig heil at the screen.<br><br>\"Damn it Kid,\" I scolded, \"Is that alien white tiger <i>also</i> the reincarnation of Adolf Hitler?\"<br><br>\"So what if he is?\" Kid whined, \"Agremnax the Destroyer is a good boy and I love him!\"<br><br>\"Damn it, Kid! He's part alien and the Nazis are going to use him to bring back Hitler!\"<br><br>\"You don't know that!\"<br><br>\"Actually\n ve were planning exactly these things.\" The gestapo officer announcing \nhis presence chuckled to himself, \"Unt if you do not cooperate-\"<br><br>Kid and I both drew our .38 specials and shot the nazi several times in the dick and balls.<br><br>\"Achtung!\" The nazi gurgled, \"I haff been shot!\"<br><br>\"Shut up we're trying to think!\"<br><br>\"Okay so if the nazis sent him in here...\"<br><br>\"That means there are about three to five more waiting outside.\"<br><br>\"So what are we looking at?\"<br><br>\"The locks will only hold them for two more minutes.\"<br><br>All of a sudden there was a loud clicking as Agremnax the Destroyer jumped up and undid the locks with his teeth.<br><br>\"... Or less, if they have the literal reincarnation of Hitler on the inside.\"<br><br>The nazis busted in and held us at gunpoint.<br><br>\"Hi guys.\"<br><br>---<br><br>Kid\n and I hung upside down over a dug out pit of several dozen starving \npigs as nearby in what appeared to be the remains of a castle floor with\n a swastika in a circle the Nazis began the job of using ancient magicks\n to resurrect Hitler. They even hired a DJ to hype the nazis up. It was \nsomething else.<br><br>\"So I should probably have gotten the parrot instead?\"<br><br>\"God no can you imagine the things it would hear?\"<br><br>Kid imitated a parrot's squawking. \"Fuck me harder with that horse cock you prepubescent bitch!\"<br><br>\"So how many do you think are down there?\"<br><br>\"At least twenty.\"<br><br>\"How do you know?\"<br><br>\"I can tell the difference.\" Kid shrugged, \"Number 14 is my favorite.\"<br><br>\"Why's that.\"<br><br>\"He's got a little bit of poop stuck to his tail and it splatters on the other pigs when he gets happy.\"<br><br>\"That's cute.\"<br><br>\"Hey,\" The Nazi called over to us, \"You guys don't sound very terrified and it's really bringing everyone down.\"<br><br>\"Sorry!\" I shouted<br><br>\"How's this?\" Kid asked as she put on a look of horror<br><br>\"It's better, thanks you guys!\"<br><br>\"No problem chief.\"<br><br>\"Yeah you guys keep doing your thing we'll escape in a minute.\"<br><br>\"Okay cool can you just give us a heads up beforehand?\"<br><br>\"Oh no of course\"<br><br>\"Yeah this isn't our first escape from being tied up over a pit of dangerous animals.\"<br><br>\"actually this happens like once or twice a week.\"<br><br>\"<i>At least</i> once or twice.\"<br><br>\"Okay you guys are doing great by the way real five star performance.\"<br><br>\"Oh no yeah likewise.\" I conceded, \"This is classic comic book peril.\"<br><br>\"Like good enough to give us a favorable review, ya?\"<br><br>\"Oh yeah no just untie us and we'll totally sign your performance cards or whatever.\"<br><br>\"Oh goodie!\" the nazi giggled excitedly as he got us down and untied us, \"Now if you could just-\"<br><br>I\n grabbed the nazi's pistol and shot him in the head, unloading the clip \ninto the rest of the nazi scumbags before nailing a totally sick shot on\n the tiger-Hitler-Reptilian-Hybrid.<br><br>Unfortunately the mutt just \nwouldn't die and as it ran off into the woods Kid and I tore ass after \nthe thing. It must have been real quick though because at some point we \nended up in a clearing with no idea which<br>direction to go in. And also no idea where the hell we were.<br><br>\"Nice job,\" Kid groaned, \"We're fuckin' lost in the woods. Again.\"<br><br>\"How is any of this my fault!?\"<br><br>\"You chased after him first!\"<br><br>\"Because he's your pet!\"<br><br>\"Bullshit.\"<br><br>\"Okay fair I did it to stop hitler and the r-\"<br><br>I\n stopped mid-sentence and mid-step as an eerie, all-encompassing green \nlight washed over us. It was unbreaking as it fell upon us, and I'm \ncertain I could feel my sperm die in that moment.<br><br>We stood there,\n pretty sure the reptians were gonna royally fuck my shit up tight dawg,\n when the Middle Child Ship returned to the mothership to do what middle\n child ships do best: be failures who will never live up to the \nexpectations set by the older brother ship.<br><br>\"Did a reptilian ship just...\"<br><br>\"No yeah it definitely just left.\"<br><br>\"For what?\" Kid demanded, \"Did they find him?\"<br><br>\"No,\"\n I correccted her, sepping out of the thick underbrush onto the cliff \noverlooking the massive fantasy city of Nome, home of the Gnomes, \"And \nseeing as how we're not in Kansas aymore...\"<br><br>\"The fuck are you on ab-\" Kid began as she stepped out with me, \"Oh.\"<br><br>\"Yeah.\"<br><br>\"Oh fuck.\"<br><br><b>Chapter Three - No Place Like (g)Nome</b><br><br>First I should clarify we definitely weren't high and this definitely wasn't Kansas anymore.<br><br>Actually that's a lie. We were very high and we've never been to Kansas.<br><br>But\n we were definitely not tripping. And as we approached the cobblestone \nstreets the sight of all the bearded midgets made me realize one thing:<br><br>We're pretty much gods to them.<br><br>So\n with that in mind you can probably guess what Kid and I did to take \nover the bizarre parallel fantasy world we apparently stumbled into. And\n we did it in record time because a world of smurfs and elves is a world\n of swords and magic and a world of smurfs and magic doesn't hold up to \nguns and shit.<br><br>---<br><br>\"You'll never get away with it!\" The (former) Gnomish Emporor griped, \"You're too darn tall!\"<br><br>\"That's\n a damn lie!\" I shouted as I pointed a gun at the manservant attending \nto my feet, \"the gnomes love me, don't you Short Run?\"<br><br>\"Y-Yes sir.\" Short Run stammered in fear, \"Also my name is-\"<br><br>\"Shut the fuck up, Short Run!\" Kid shouted at him angrily.<br><br>---<br><br>\"Sir, the Taliban is invading!\"<br><br>I looked up from eating my little sister's ass and pulled off my gimp hood. \"The what?\"<br><br>\"The Taliban!\"<br><br>\"... As in the Afghani Taliban?\"<br><br>\"Where the fuck did you think you were?\"<br><br>\"... Noooooot in a rural afghani villaige populated by terrified pygmies?\"<br><br>\"That does explain the hummus.\" Kid mused, pulling her hot pink ball-gag off.<br><br>---<br><br>The\n sun beat down on the mud hut roofings of the rural afghani villaige, so\n rural in fact that it didn't even have a gun market (which really would\n have come in handy for what was about to happen to these poor<br>schmucks).\n Kid and I considered abandoning ship, but then I remembered 9/11 and \nhow funny it was. After that we decided to just fuck it and bail on \nthese midges.<br><br>So we get to Kabul and as expected those dudes \ndon't even bother to check if we're terrorists they just let us on the \nplane. And after getting back stateside we made our first order of \nbusiness to get just absolutely<br>fucked up.<br><br>---<br><br>Step \nnumber one when waking up on a cold floor with no idea where you are and\n how you got there is to check your surroundings for people. I found \nthree. One was alive, but unconscious, and the rest were the previous \noccupants of the house my little sister and I had apparently broken into\n in what I can only surmise was a drug-and-alcohol-induced black out. \nNow, you might then look for your phone and call the police. Two \nproblems with that - someone was already calling me and evidently I \nwould have to visit the hospital at a later point in time to get an \nobject removed from my colon. Punching my abdomen I heard the phone \nconnect and a (very muffled) voice on the other end of the line.<br><br>\"This is the Bulldog.\" The modulated voice on the other end of the line growled, \"Are they dead yet?\"<br><br>\"Uh... Yes?\"<br><br>\"Where are you?\" The voice demanded, \"It sounds wet.\"<br><br>\"I'm going through a colon!\" I explained half paying attention, \"I mean tunnel.\"<br><br>\"Regardless, we have another job for you.\"<br><br>\"Cooooool.\" I trailed off, \"Just one question.\"<br><br>\"No questions.\"<br><br>\"K.\"<br><br>\"I'm sending the address.\" The voice growled, \"The mark is six one, bald, and knows you're coming.\"<br><br>\"What,\" I joked, \"Is it mr Clean?\"<br><br>\"... Just get the job done.\"<br><br>Click.<br><br>The\n coordinates I got in a text a few minutes later, but with no way to \nread it I had to borrow the dead guy's cell to call the one person who \ncould help me figure out who I just agreed to murder.<br><br>\"Madam \nWhorina Thotiana's Gypsie Psychic Emporium and Notary Public, this is \nMadam Whorina Thotiana speaking. How can I help you, Ace?\"<br><br>\"Damn you're good.\"<br><br>\"I know dahling, I'm a psychic.\"<br><br>\"Do you know wh-\"<br><br>\"Mister Clean.\"<br><br>\"I fucking knew it!\" I shouted, hanging up immediately before she could slap me with charges.<br><br>---<br><br>According\n to I.N.T.E.L., Mr. Clean was on the 69th floor of the Nabisco Tower in \nDubai, which was currently under the control of the Siberian branch of \nZ-Corp. That meant we couldn't just bust in the way we normally did. \nWe'd have to hijack a cargo plane and HALO in overhead. But to do that \nwe'd need a B-team to cut the power to the whole city. Luckily, for us, \nGuatemalan ISIS was more than happy to stage a terror attack on the \npower plant to lure the military to their coordinates. That left the \nsimple matter of killing mr Clean to Kid and I. And thanks to our \nefforts in Caracas we had clearly dealt a financial blow to Z-corp, who \ncould only afford two easily overwhelmed guards to patrol the massive \nskyscraper rooftop.<br><br><br>\"Son of a bitch.\" Kid scoffed, \"You knew.\"<br><br>\"You think I'd just let you play dirty?\" he growled, \"I'm mister fucking Clean.\"<br><br>He whapped her across the back of the head and from then on out it was up to me to rescue my little sister. Again.<br><br>---<br><br>\"Kid Courageous.\" Mister Clean began his monologue pacing my little sister, \"So we meet again?\"<br><br>\"Bitch I'm twelve.\" Kid laughed, \"Were you lurking around my middle school or something?\"<br><br>\"You don't remember?\" He chuckled darkly, \"From Caracas?\"<br><br>\"Oh shit.\"<br><br>---<br><br><i>Several weeks ago </i><i>at Z-Corp HQ...<br></i><p><br></p><p>\"Please wait!\" The last of the nazi stormtroopers insisted, \"You killed our leader that means you're the oberfuhrers now!\"<br><br>We both turned to face him.<br><br>\"Why the fuck would we want that?\"<br><br>\"Oh, balls.\"</p><p><br></p><p>---</p><p><br></p><p>\"You were the guy we shot?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Yes.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's retarded.\" Kid reasoned, \"It was a headshot.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I'm a cyborg now.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh that reminds me, we need to cut this short.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Why the hell would we do that?\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Because I'm about to be rescued.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"Oh please,\" Mr. Clean roared with laughter, \"Who could possibly get past me?\"<br></p><p><br></p><p>\"I mean...\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"I'm fucking BIONIC.\" Mr Clean bragged, \"It'd take a better, more futuristic cyborg to-\"<br></p><p><br>All of a sudden I used the full extent of my cybernetic augmentations to burst through the door and tackle Kid clean out the window of the 69th floor of Z-Corp's Dubai branch (nice).</p><p><br></p><p>\"Took you long enough!\" Kid shouted as I pulled the ripcord on the parachute.</p><p><br></p><p>\"Wow, okay.\" I scoffed, \"So just drop you right here or?\"</p><p><br></p><p>She pulled a gun on me.<br>\"Try me bitch.\"</p><p><br>\"Rescinded.\"</p><p><br></p><p>\"That's what I thought.\"<br></p>",
