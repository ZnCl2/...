You'll have to go into the folder containing your blog and open the `all.css` file.\n\nSearch for `.left .avatar{` and replace the last object where it says image pixelated with:\n\n```\n background-image: url('data:image/jpg;base64,____');\n```\n\nYou'll have to convert your avatar image to base64 and replace `____` with the text (it will be rather long).\n\nSecondly, to make sure everything looks ok, change `background-size:` to 100%."
