So this part should work. \n\nAs for the ZeroNet part: Your ideas look good, but a bit complicated. It would be cool if something like this worked in the end. But for the moment, it is ok to have a static page listing the options to get in touch.",

Or probably it will also work, if you load it on a proxy, that then keeps it in cache for a few hours.\n\nAs to the theme: I prefer to not have the theme in the repo. I wanted to add theme downloading to the publish_zeronet.sh script. But just didn't have the time yet. \nDid you have to change anything in the theme files?\n\nOnce I can load your code, I will disect it. Or even better, if you could edit the pull request to not contain the theme files. That would help keeping the repo small.",
