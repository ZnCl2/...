<h4>
Preface to
the First Edition
</h4>

<p>
The question of the state is now acquiring particular importance both
in  theory and in practical politics.  The imperialist war has
immensely  accelerated and intensified the process of transformation of
monopoly  capitalism into state-monopoly capitalism.  The monstrous
oppression of  the working people by the state, which is merging more 
and more with the all-powerful capitalist associations, is
becoming increasingly  monstrous.  The advanced countries - we mean
their hinterland - are  becoming military convict prisons for the
workers. 
</p>

<p>
The unprecedented horrors and miseries of the protracted was are making
the people's position unbearable and increasing their anger.  The world
proletarian revolution is clearly maturing.  The question of its
relation to the state is acquiring practical importance. 
</p>

<p>
The elements of opportunism that accumulated over the decades of
comparatively peaceful development have given rise to the trend of
social-chauvinism which dominated the official socialist parties
throughout the world.  This trend - socialism in words and chauvinism
in deeds (Plekhanov, Potresov, Breshkovskaya, Rubanovich, and, in a
slightly veiled form, Tsereteli, Chernov and Co.  in Russia;
Scheidemann.  Legien, David and others in Germany; Renaudel, Guesde and
Vandervelde in France and Belgium; Hyndman and the Fabians in England,
etc., etc.) - is conspicuous for the base, servile adaptation of the
"leaders of socialism" to the interests not only of "their" national
bourgeoisie, but of "their" state, for the majority of the so-called
Great Powers have long been exploiting and enslaving a whole number of
small and weak nations.  And the imperialist war is a war for the
division and redivision of this kind of booty.  The struggle to free
the working people from the influence of the bourgeoisie in general,
and of the imperialist bourgeoisie in particular, is impossible without
a struggle against opportunist prejudices concerning the "state". 
</p>

<p>
First of all we examine the theory of Marx and Engels of the state, and
dwell in particular detail on those aspects of this theory which are
ignored or have been distorted by the opportunists.  Then we deal
specially with the one who is chiefly responsible for these
distortions, Karl Kautsky, the best-known leader of the Second
International (1889-1914), which has met with such miserable bankruptcy
in the present war.  Lastly, we sum up the main results of the
experience of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and particularly of 1917.
 Apparently, the latter is now (early August 1917) completing the first
stage of its development; but this revolution as a whole can only be
understood as a link in a chain of socialist proletarian revolutions
being caused by the imperialist war.  The question of the relation of
the socialist proletarian revolution to the state, therefore, is
acquiring not only practical political importance, but also the
significance of a most urgent problem of the day, the problem of
explaining to the masses what they will have to do before long to free
themselves from capitalist tyranny.
