<h4>
Chapter VII: The Experience of the Russian Revolutions<br>
of 1905 and 1917
</h4>

<br>

<p>
The subject indicated in the title of this chapter is so vast that
volumes could be written about it.  In the present pamphlet we shall
have to confine ourselves, naturally, to the most important lessons
provided by experience, those bearing directly upon the tasks of the
proletariat in the revolution with regard to state power.

<h4>
PostScript to the First Edition
</h4>


<p>
This pamphlet was written in August and September 1917.  I had already
drawn up the plan for the next, the seventh chapter, "The Experience of
the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917".  Apart from the title,
however, I had no time to write a single line of the chapter; I was
"interrupted" by a political crisis - the eve of the October revolution
of 1917.  Such an "interruption" can only be welcomed; but the writing
of the second part of this pamphlet ("The Experience of the Russian
Revolutions of 1905 and 1917") will probably have to be put off for a
long time.  It is more pleasant and useful to go through the "experience
of revolution" than to write about it.
