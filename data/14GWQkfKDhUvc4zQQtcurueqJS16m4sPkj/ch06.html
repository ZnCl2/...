<p>
The question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and
of the social revolution to the state, like the question of revolution
generally, was given very little attention by the leading theoreticians
and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914).  But the most
characteristic thing about the process of the gradual growth of
opportunism that led to the collapse of the Second International in 1914
is the fact that even when these people were squarely faced with this
question they tried to evade it or ignored it. 
</p>

<p>
In general, it may be said that evasiveness over the question of the
relation of the proletarian revolution to the state - an evasiveness
which benefited and fostered opportunism - resulted in the distortion
of Marxism and in its complete vulgarization. 
</p>

<p>
To characterize this lamentable process, if only briefly, we shall take
the most prominent theoreticians of Marxism: Plekhanov and Kautsky. 
</p>





<a name="s1"></a>
<br>&#160;
<br>

<h4>
1. Plekhanov's Controversy with the Anarchists
</h4>


<p>
Plekhanov wrote a special pamphlet on the relation of anarchism to
socialism, entitled <em>Anarchism and Socialism</em>, which was published in
german in 1894. 
</p>

<p>
In treating this subject, Plekhanov contrived completely to evade the
most urgent, burning, and most politically essential issue in the
struggle against anarchism, namely, the relation of the revolution to
the state, and the question of the state in general! His pamphlet falls
into two distinct parts: one of them is historical and literary, and
contains valuable material on the history of the ideas of Stirner,
Proudhon, and others; the other is philistine, and contains a clumsy
dissertation on the theme that an anarchist cannot be distinguished from
a bandit. 
</p>

<p>
It is a most amusing combination of subjects and most characteristic of
Plekhanov's whole activity on the eve of the revolution and during the
revolutionary period in Russia.  In fact, in the years 1905 to 1917,
Plekhanov revealed himself as a semi-doctrinaire and semi-philistine
who, in politics, trailed in the wake of the bourgeoisie. 
</p>

<p>
We have now seen how, in their controversy with the anarchists, marx and
Engels with the utmost thoroughness explained their views on the
relation of revolution to the state.  In 1891, in his foreword to Marx's
<a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1870/gotha/index.html">Critique of the Gotha Programme</a>, Engels wrote that "we" - that is,
Engels and Marx - "were at that time, hardly two years after the Hague
Congress of the [First] International, engaged in the most violent
struggle against Bakunin and his anarchists."
</p>

<p>
The anarchists had tried to claim the Paris Commune as their "own", so
to say, as a collaboration of their doctrine; and they completely
misunderstood its lessons and Marx's analysis of these lessons. 
Anarchism has given nothing even approximating true answers to the
concrete political questions: Must the old state machine be smashed? And
what should be put in its place?
</p>

<p>
But to speak of "anarchism and socialism" while completely evading the
question of the state, and disregarding the whole development of Marxism
before and after the Commune, meant inevitably slipping into
opportunism.  For what opportunism needs most of all is that the two
questions just mentioned should not be raised at all.  That in itself is
a victory for opportunism. 
</p>

<br>&#160;
<br>

<h4>
2. Kautsky's Controversy with the Opportunists
</h4>

<p>
Undoubtedly, an immeasurably larger number of Kautsky's works have been
translated into Russian than into any other language.  It is not without
reason that some German Social-Democrats say in jest that Kautsky is
read more in Russia than in Germany (let us say, in parenthesis, that
this jest has a far deeper historical meaning than those who first made
it suspect.  The Russian workers, by making in 1905 an unusually great
and unprecedented demand for the best works of the best Social-
Democratic literature and editions of these works in quantities unheard
of in other countries, rapidly transplanted, so to speak, the enormous
experience of a neighboring, more advanced country to the young soil of
our proletarian movement). 
</p>

<p>
Besides his popularization of Marxism, Kautsky is particularly known in
our country for his controversy with the opportunists, with Bernstein at
their head.  One fact, however, is almost unknown, one which cannot be
ignored if we set out to investigate how Kautsky drifted into the morass
of unbelievably disgraceful confusion and defence of social-chauvinism
during the supreme crisis of 1914-15.  This fact is as follows: shortly
before he came out against the most prominent representatives of
opportunism in France (Millerand and Jaures) and in Germany (Bernstein),
Kautsky betrayed very considerable vacillation.  The Marxist <em>Zarya</em>,
which was published in Stuttgart in 1901-02, and advocated revolutionary
proletarian views, was forced to enter into controversy with Kautsky and
describe as "elastic" the half-hearted, evasive resolution, conciliatory
towards the opportunists, that he proposed at the International
Socialist Congress in Paris in 1900.  Kautsky's letters published in
Germany reveal no less hesitancy on his part before he took the field
against Bernstein. 
</p>

<p>
Of immeasurably greater significance, however, is the fact that, in his
very controversy with the opportunists, in his formulation of the
question and his manner of treating it, we can new see, as we study the
history of Kautsky's latest betrayal of Marxism, his systematic
deviation towards opportunism precisely on the question of the state. 
</p>

<p>
Let us take Kautsky's first important work against opportunism,
<em>Bernstein and the Social-Democratic Programme</em>.  Kautsky refutes
Bernstein in detail, but here is a characteristic thing: Bernstein, in
his <em>Premises of Socialism</em>, of Herostratean fame, accuses Marxism of
"Blanquism" (an accusation since repeated thousands of times by the
opportunists and liberal bourgeoisie in Russia against the revolutionary
Marxists, the Bolsheviks).  In this connection Bernstein dwells
particularly on Marx's <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864iwma/1871-cwf/index.html">The Civil War in France</a>, and tries, quite
unsuccessfully, as we have seen, to identify Marx's views on the lessons
of the Commune with those of Proudhon.  Bernstein pays particular
attention to the conclusion which Marx emphasized in his 1872 preface to
the <a href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1840/com-man/index.html">Communist Manifesto</a>, namely, that "the working class cannot simply
lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own
purposes". 
</p>

<p>
This statement "pleased" Bernstein so much that he used it no less than
three times in his book, interpreting it in the most distorted,
opportunist way. 
</p>

<p>
As we have seen, Marx meant that the working-class must smash, break,
shatter (<em>sprengung</em>, explosion - the expression used by Engels) the
whole state machine.  But according to Bernstein it would appear as
though Marx in these words warned the working class against excessive
revolutionary zeal when seizing power. 
</p>

<p>
A cruder more hideous distortion of Marx's idea cannot be imagined. 
</p>

<p>
How, then, did Kautsky proceed in his most detailed refutation of
Bernsteinism?
</p>

<p>
He refrained from analyzing the utter distortion of Marxism by
opportunism o this point.  He cited the above-quoted passage from
Engels' preface to Marx's <em>Civil War</em> and said that according to Marx
the working class cannot simply take over the ready-made state
machinery, but that, generally speaking, it can take it over - and that
was all.  Kautsky did not say a word about the fact that Bernstein
attributed to Marx the very opposite of Marx's real idea, that since
1852 Marx had formulated the task of the proletarian revolution as being
to "smash" the state machine. 
</p>

<p>
The result was that the most essential distinction between Marxism and
opportunism on the subject of the tasks of the proletarian revolution
was slurred over by Kautsky!
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "We can quite safely leave the solution of the problems of the
     proletarian dictatorship of the future," said Kautsky, writing
     "against" Bernstein. 
          </p>
     <p class="inline">
                                            (p.172, German edition)
</p>

<p>
This is not a polemic against Bernstein, but, in essence, a concession
to him, a surrender to opportunism; for at present the opportunists ask
nothing better than to "quite safely leave to the future" all
fundamental questions of the tasks of the proletarian revolution. 
</p>

<p>
From 1852 to 1891, or for 40 years, Marx and Engels taught the
proletariat that it must smash the state machine.  Yet, in 1899,
Kautsky, confronted with the complete betrayal of Marxism by the
opportunists on this point, fraudulently substituted for the question
whether it is necessary to smash this machine the question for the
concrete forms in which it is to be smashed, and then sough refuge
behind the "indisputable" (and barren) philistine truth that concrete
forms cannot be known in advance!!
</p>

<p>
A gulf separates Marx and Kautsky over their attitude towards the
proletarian party's task of training the working class for revolution. 
</p>

<p>
Let us take the next, more mature, work by Kautsky, which was also
largely devoted to a refutation of opportunist errors.  It is his
pamphlet, <em>The Social Revolution</em>.  In this pamphlet, the author chose
as his special theme the question of "the proletarian revolution" and
"the proletarian regime".  He gave much that was exceedingly valuable,
but he avoided the question of the state.  Throughout the pamphlet the
author speaks of the winning of state power - and no more; that is, he
has chosen a formula which makes a concession to the opportunists,
inasmuch as it admits the possibility of seizing power without
destroying the state machine.  The very thing which Marx in 1872
declared to be "obsolete" in the programme of the <em>Communist Manifesto</em>,
is revived by Kautsky in 1902. 
</p>

<p>
A special section in the pamphlet is devoted to the "forms and weapons
of the social revolution".  Here Kautsky speaks of the mass political
strike, of civil war, and of the "instruments of the might of the modern
large state, its bureaucracy and the army"; but he does not say a word
about what the Commune has already taught the workers.  Evidently, it
was not without reason that Engels issued a warning, particularly to the
German socialists.  against "superstitious reverence" for the state. 
</p>

<p>
Kautsky treats the matter as follows: the victorious proletariat "will
carry out the democratic programme", and he goes on to formulate its
clauses.  But he does not say a word about the new material provided in
1871 on the subject of the replacement of bourgeois democracy by
proletarian democracy.  Kautsky disposes of the question by using such
"impressive-sounding" banalities as:
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "Still, it goes without saying that we shall not achieve supremacy
     under the present conditions.  Revolution itself presupposes long
     and deep-going struggles, which, in themselves, will change our
     present political and social structure."
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly, this "goes without saying", just as the fact that horses
eat oats of the Volga flows into the Caspian.  Only it is a pity that an
empty and bombastic phrase about "deep-going" struggles is used to avoid
a question of vital importance to the revolutionary proletariat, namely,
what makes its revolution "deep-going" in relation to the state, to
democracy, as distinct from previous, non-proletarian revolutions. 
</p>

<p>
By avoiding this question, Kautsky in practice makes a concession to
opportunism on this most essential point, although in words he declares
stern war against it and stresses the importance of the "idea of
revolution" (how much is this "idea" worth when one is afraid to teach
the workers the concrete lessons of revolution?), or says,
"revolutionary idealism before everything else", or announces that the
English workers are now "hardly more than petty bourgeois". 
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "The most varied form of enterprises - bureaucratic [??], trade
     unionist, co-operative, private...  can exist side by side in
     socialist society," Kautsky writes.  "...  There are, for example,
     enterprises which cannot do without a bureaucratic [??]
     organization, such as the railways.  Here the democratic
     organization may take the following shape: the workers elect
     delegates who form a sort of parliament, which establishes the
     working regulations and supervises the management of the
     bureaucratic apparatus.  The management of other countries may be
     transferred to the trade unions, and still others may become
     co-operative enterprises."
</p>

<p>
This argument is erroneous; it is a step backward compared with the
explanations Marx and Engels gave in the seventies, using the lessons of
the Commune as an example. 
</p>

<p>
As far as the supposedly necessary "bureaucratic" organization is
concerned, there is no difference whatever between a railway and any
other enterprise in large-scale machine industry, any factory, large
shop, or large-scale capitalist agricultural enterprise.  The technique
of all these enterprises makes absolutely imperative the strictest
discipline, the utmost precision on the part of everyone in carry out
his allotted task, for otherwise the whole enterprise may come to a
stop, or machinery or the finished product may be damaged.  In all these
enterprises the workers will, of course, "elect delegates who will form
a sort of parliament". 
</p>

<p>
The whole point, however, is that this "sort of parliament" will not be
a parliament in the sense of a bourgeois parliamentary institution.  The
whole point is that this "sort of parliament" will not merely "establish
the working regulations and supervise the management" of the
"apparatus", but this apparatus will not be "bureaucratic".  The
workers, after winning political power, will smash the old bureaucratic
apparatus, shatter it to its very foundations, and raze it to the
ground; they will replace it by a new one, consisting of the very same
workers and other employees, against whose transformation into
bureaucrats the measures will at once be taken which were specified in
detail by Marx and Engels:
</p>

<p class="quotec">
  (1) not only election, but also recall at any time;
</p>

<p class="quotec">
  (2) pay not to exceed that of a workman;
</p>

<p class="quotec">
  (3) immediate introduction of control and supervision by all, so that
      all may become "bureaucrats" for a time and that, therefore,
      nobody may be able to become a "bureaucrat". 
</p>


<p>
Kautsky has not reflected at all on Marx's words: "The Commune was a
working, not parliamentary, body, executive and legislative at the same
time."
</p>

<p>
Kautsky has not understood at all the difference between bourgeois
parliamentarism, which combines democracy (not for the people) with
bureaucracy (against the people), and proletarian democracy, which will
take immediate steps to cut bureaucracy down to the roots, and which
will be able to carry these measures through to the end, to the complete
abolition of bureaucracy, to the introduction of complete democracy for
the people. 
</p>

<p>
Kautsky here displays the same old "superstitious reverence" for the
state, and "superstitious belief" in bureaucracy. 
</p>

<p>
Let us now pass to the last and best of Kautsky's works against the
opportunists, his pamphlet <em>The Road to Power</em> (which, I believe, has
not been published in Russian, for it appeared in 1909, when reaction
was at its height in our country).  This pamphlet is a big step forward,
since it does not deal with the revolutionary programme in general, as
the pamphlet of 1899 against Bernstein, or with the tasks of the social
revolution irrespective of the time of its occurrence, as the 1902
pamphlet, <em>The Social Revolution</em>; it deals with the concrete conditions
which compels us to recognize that the "era of revolutions" is setting
in. 
</p>

<p>
The author explicitly points to the aggravation of class antagonisms in
general and to imperialism, which plays a particularly important part in
this respect.  After the "revolutionary period of 1789-1871" in Western
Europe, he says, a similar period began in the East in 1905.  A world
war is approaching with menacing rapidity.  "It [the proletariat] can no
longer talk of premature revolution." "We have entered a revolutionary
period." The "revolutionary era is beginning". 
</p>

<p>
These statements are perfectly clear.  This pamphlet of Kautsky's should
serve as a measure of comparison of what the German Social-Democrats
promised to be before the imperialist war and the depth of degradation
to which they, including Kautsky himself, sank when the war broke out. 
"The present situation," Kautsky wrote in the pamphlet under survey, "is
fraught with the danger that we [i.e., the German Social-Democrats] may
easily appear to be more 'moderate' than we really are." It turned out
that in reality the German Social-Democratic Party was much more
moderate and opportunist than it appeared to be!
</p>

<p>
It is all the more characteristic, therefore, that although Kautsky so
explicitly declared that the era of revolution had already begun, in the
pamphlet which he himself said was devoted to an analysis of the
"political revolution", he again completely avoided the question of the
state. 
</p>

<p>
These evasions of the question, these omissions and equivocations,
inevitably added up to that complete swing-over to opportunism with
which we shall now have to deal. 
</p>

<p>
Kautsky, the German Social-Democrats' spokesman, seems to have declared:
I abide by revolutionary views (1899), I recognize, above all, the
inevitability of the social revolution of the proletariat (1902), I
recognize the advent of a new era of revolutions (1909).  Still, I am
going back on what Marx said as early as 1852, since the question of the
tasks of the proletarian revolution in relation to the state is being
raised (1912). 
</p>

<p>
It was in this point-blank form that the question was put in Kautsky's
controversy with Pannekoek. 
</p>






<a name="s3"></a>
<br>&#160;
<br>

<h4>
3. Kautsky's Controversy with Pannekoek
</h4>

            
<p>
In opposing Kautsky, Pannekoek came out as one of the representatives of
the "Left radical" trend which included Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Radek, and
others.  Advocating revolutionary tactics, they were united in the
conviction that Kautsky was going over to the "Centre", which wavered in
an unprincipled manner between Marxism and opportunism.  This view was
proved perfectly correct by the war, when this "Centrist" (wrongly
called Marxist) trend, or Kautskyism, revealed itself in all its
repulsive wretchedness. 
</p>

<p>
In an article touching on the question of the state, entitled "Mass
Action and Revolution" (<em>Neue Zeit</em>, 1912, Vol.XXX, 2), Pannekoek
described kautsky's attitude as one of "passive radicalism", as "a
theory of inactive expectancy".  "Kautsky refuses to see the process of
revolution," wrote Pannekoek (p.616).  In presenting the matter in this
way, Pannekoek approached the subject which interests us, namely, the
tasks of the proletarian revolution in relation to the state. 
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "The struggle of the proletariat," he wrote, "is not merely a
     struggle against the bourgeoisie for state power, but a struggle
     <em>against</em> state power....  The content of this [the proletarian]
     revolution is the destruction and dissolution [Auflosung] of the
     instruments of power of the state with the aid of the instruments
     of power of the proletariat.
     </p>
     <p class="inline">
                                                               (p.544)
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "The struggle will cease only when, as the result of it, the state
     organization is completely destroyed.  The organization of the
     majority will then have demonstrated its superiority by destroying
     the organization of the ruling minority."
          </p>
     <p class="inline">
                                                               (p.548)
</p>

<p>
The formulation in which Pannekoek presented his ideas suffers from
serious defects.  But its meaning is clear nonetheless, and it is
interesting to note how Kautsky combated it. 
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "Up to now," he wrote, "the antithesis between the Social-Democrats
     and the anarchists has been that the former wished to win the state
     power while the latter wished to destroy it.  Pannekoek wants to do
     both."
     </p>
     <p class="inline">
                                                               (p.724)
</p>

<p>
Although Pannekoek's exposition lacks precision and concreteness - not
to speak of other shortcomings of his article which have no bearing on
the present subject - Kautsky seized precisely on the point of
principle raised by Pannekoek; and on this fundamental point of
principle Kautsky completely abandoned the Marxist position and went
over wholly to opportunism.  His definition of the distinction between
the Social-Democrats and the anarchists is absolutely wrong; he
completely vulgarizes and distorts Marxism. 
</p>

<p>
The distinction between Marxists and the anarchists is this:
</p>

<p class="quotec">
  (1) The former, while aiming at the complete abolition of the state,
      recognize that this aim can only be achieved after classes have
      been abolished by the socialist revolution, as the result of the
      establishment of socialism, which leads to the withering away of
      the state.  The latter want to abolish he state completely
      overnight, not understanding the conditions under which the state
      can be abolished.
</p>

<p class="quotec">
  (2) The former recognize that after the proletariat has won political
      power it must completely destroy the old state machine and replace
      it by a new one consisting of an organization of the armed
      workers, after the type of the Commune.  The latter, while
      insisting on the destruction of the state machine, have a very
      vague idea of what the proletariat will put in its place and how
      it will use its revolutionary power.  The anarchists even deny
      that the revolutionary proletariat should use the state power,
      they reject its revolutionary dictatorship. 
</p>

<p class="quotec">
  (3) The former demand that the proletariat be trained for revolution
      by utilizing the present state.  The anarchists reject this. 
</p>



<p>
In this controversy, it is not Kautsky but Pannekoek who represents
Marxism, for it was Marx who taught that the proletariat cannot simply
win state power in the sense that the old state apparatus passes into
new hands, but must smash this apparatus, must break it and replace it
by a new one. 
</p>

<p>
Kautsky abandons Marxism for the opportunist camp, for this destruction
of the state machine, which is utterly unacceptable to the opportunists,
completely disappears from his argument, and he leaves a loophole for
them in that "conquest" may be interpreted as the simple acquisition of
a majority. 
</p>

<p>
To cover up his distortion of Marxism, Kautsky behaves like a
doctrinaire: he puts forward a "quotation" from Marx himself.  In 1850,
Marx wrote that a "resolute centralization of power in the hands of the
state authority" was necessary, and Kautsky triumphantly asks: does
Pannekoek want to destroy "Centralism"?
</p>

<p>
This is simply a trick, like Bernstein's identification of the views of
Marxism and Proudhonism on the subject of federalism as against
centralism. 
</p>

<p>
Kautsky's "quotation" is neither here nor there.  Centralism is possible
with both the old and the new state machine.  If the workers voluntarily
unite their armed forces, this will be centralism, but it will be based
on the "complete destruction" of the centralized state apparatus - the
standing army, the police, and the bureaucracy.  Kautsky acts like an
outright swindler by evading the perfectly well-known arguments of Marx
and Engels on the Commune and plucking out a quotation which has nothing
to do with the point at issue. 
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "Perhaps he [Pannekoek]," Kautsky continues, "wants to abolish the
     state functions of the officials? But we cannot do without
     officials even in the party and trade unions, let alone in the
     state administration.  And our programme does not demand the
     abolition of state officials, but that they be elected by the
     people....  We are discussing here not the form the administrative
     apparatus of the 'future state' will assume, but whether our
     political struggle abolishes [literally dissolves - auflost] the
     state power <em>before we have captured it</em>.  [Kautsky's italics]
     Which ministry with its officials could be abolished?" Then follows
     an enumeration of the ministeries of education, justice, finance,
     and war.  "No, not one of the present ministries will be removed by
     our political struggle against the government....  I repeat, in
     order to prevent misunderstanding: we are not discussing here the
     form the 'future state' will be given by the victorious Social-
     Democrats, but how the present state is changed by our opposition."

                                                                 (p.725)
</p>

<p>
This is an obvious trick.  Pannekoek raised the question of revolution. 
Both the title of his article and the passages quoted above clearly
indicate this.  By skipping to the question of "opposition", Kautksy
substitutes the opportunist for the revolutionary point of view.  What
he says means: at present we are an opposition; what we shall be after
we have captured power, that we shall see.  Revolution has vanished! And
that is exactly what the opportunists wanted. 
</p>

<p>
The point at issue is neither opposition nor political struggle in
general, but revolution.  Revolution consists in the proletariat
destroying the "administrative apparatus" and the whole state machine,
replacing it by a new one, made up of the armed workers.  Kautsky
displays a "superstitious reverence" for "ministries"; but why can they
not be replaced, say, by committees of specialists working under
sovereign, all-powerful Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies?
</p>

<p>
The point is not at all whether the "ministries" will remain, or whether
"committees of specialists" or some other bodies will be set up; that is
quite immaterial.  The point is whether the old state machine (bound by
thousands of threads to the bourgeoisie and permeated through and
through with routine and inertia) shall remain, or be destroyed and
replaced by a new one.  Revolution consists not in the new class
commanding, governing with the aid of the old state machine, but in this
class smashing this machine and commanding, governing with the aid of a
new machine.  Kautsky slurs over this basic idea of Marxism, or he does
not understand it at all. 
</p>

<p>
His question about officials clearly shows that he does not understand
the lessons of the Commune or the teachings of Marx.  "We cannot to
without officials even in the party and the trade unions...."
</p>

<p>
We cannot do without officials under capitalism, under the rule of the
bourgeoisie.  The proletariat is oppressed, the working people are
enslaved by capitalism.  Under capitalism, democracy is restricted,
cramped, curtailed, mutilated by all the conditions of wage slavery, and
the poverty and misery of the people.  This and this alone is the reason
why the functionaries of our political organizations and trade unions
are corrupted - or rather tend to be corrupted - by the conditions of
capitalism and betray a tendency to become bureaucrats, i.e., privileged
persons divorced from the people and standing above the people. 
</p>

<p>
That is the essence of bureaucracy; and until the capitalists have been
expropriated and the bourgeoisie overthrown, even proletarian
functionaries will inevitably be "bureaucratized" to a certain extent. 
</p>

<p>
According to Kautsky, since elected functionaries will remain under
socialism, so will officials, so will the bureaucracy!  This is exactly
where he is wrong.  Marx, referring to the example of the Commune,
showed that under socialism functionaries will cease to be
"bureaucrats", to be "officials", they will cease to be so in proportion
as - in addition to the principle of election of officials - the
principle of recall at any time is also introduced, as salaries are
reduced to the level of the wages of the average workman, and as
parliamentary institutions are replaced by "working bodies, executive
and legislative at the same time". 
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, the whole of Kautsky's argument against Pannekoek,
and particularly the former's wonderful point that we cannot do without
officials even in our party and trade union organizations, is merely a
repetition of Bernstein's old "arguments" against Marxism in general. 
In his renegade book, <em>The Premises of Socialism</em>, Bernstein combats the
ideas of "primitive" democracy, combats what he calls "doctrinaire
democracy": binding mandates, unpaid officials, impotent central
representative bodies, etc.  to prove that this "primitive" democracy is
unsound, Bernstein refers to the experience of the British trade unions,
as interpreted by the Webbs.  Seventy years of development "in absolute
freedom", he says (p.137, German edition), convinced the trade unions
that primitive democracy was useless, and they replaced it by ordinary
democracy, i.e., parliamentarism combined with bureaucracy. 
</p>

<p>
In reality, the trade unions did not develop "in absolute freedom" but
in absolute capitalist slavery, under which, it goes without saying, a
number of concessions to the prevailing evil, violence, falsehood,
exclusion of the poor from the affairs of "higher" administration,
"cannot be done without".  Under socialism much of "primitive" democracy
will inevitably be revived, since, for the first time in the history of
civilized society the mass of population will rise to taking an
independent part, not only in voting and elections, but also in the
everyday administration of the state.  Under socialism all will govern
in turn and will soon become accustomed to no one governing. 
</p>

<p>
Marx's critico-analytical genius saw in the practical measures of the
Commune the turning-point which the opportunists fear and do not want to
recognize because of their cowardice, because they do not want to break
irrevocably with the bourgeoisie, and which the anarchists do not want
to see, either because they are in a hurry or because they do not
understand at all the conditions of great social changes.  "We must not
even think of destroying the old state machine; how can we do without
ministries and officials&gt;" argues the opportunist, who is completely
saturated with philistinism and who, at bottom, not only does not
believe in revolution, in the creative power of revolution, but lives in
mortal dread of it (like our Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries). 
</p>

<p>
"We must think only of destroying the old state machine; it is no use
probing into the concrete lessons of earlier proletarian revolutions and
analyzing what to put in the place of what has been destroyed, and how,"
argues the anarchist (the best of the anarchist, of course, and not
those who, following the Kropotkins and Co., trail behind the
bourgeoisie).  Consequently, the tactics of the anarchist become the
tactics of despair instead of a ruthlessly bold revolutionary effort to
solve concrete problems while taking into account the practical
conditions of the mass movement. 
</p>

<p>
Marx teaches us to avoid both errors; he teaches us to act with supreme
boldness in destroying the entire old state machine, and at the same
time he teaches us to put the question concretely: the Commune was able
in the space of a few weeks to start building a new, proletarian state
machine by introducing such-and-such measures to provide wider democracy
and to uproot bureaucracy.  Let us learn revolutionary boldness from the
Communards; let us see in their practical measures the outline of really
urgent and immediately possible measures, and then, following this road,
we shall achieve the complete destruction of bureaucracy. 
</p>

<p>
The possibility of this destruction is guaranteed by the fact that
socialism will shorten the working day, will raise the people to a new
life, will create such conditions for the majority of the population as
will enable everybody, without exception, to perform "state functions",
and this will lead to the complete withering away of every form of state
in general. 
</p>

<p class="quote">
     "Its object [the object of the mass strike]," Kautsky continues,
     "cannot be to destroy the state power; its only object can be to
     make the government compliant on some specific question, or to
     replace a government hostile to the proletariat by one willing to
     meet it half-way [<em>entgegenkommende</em>]...  But never, under no
     circumstances can it [that is, the proletarian victory over a
     hostile government] lead to the destruction of the state power; it
     can lead only to a certain shifting [<em>verschiebung</em>] of the balance
     of forces within the state power....  The aim of our political
     struggle remains, as in the past, the conquest of state power by
     winning a majority in parliament and by raising parliament to the
     ranks of master of the government."
          </p>
     <p class="inline">
                                                      (pp.726, 727, 732)
</p>

<p>
This is nothing but the purest and most vulgar opportunism: repudiating
revolution in deeds, while accepting it in words.  Kautsky's thoughts go
no further than a "government...  willing to meet the proletariat
half-way" - a step backward to philistinism compared with 1847, when
the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> proclaimed "the organization of the
proletariat as the ruling class". 
</p>

<p>
Kautsky will have to achieve his beloved "unity" with the Scheidmanns,
Plekhanovs, Potresovs, Tseretelis, and Chernovs, who are quite willing
to work for the "shifting of the balance of forces within the state
power", for "winning a majority in parliament", and "raising parliament
to the ranks of master of the government".  A most worthy object, which
is wholly acceptable to the opportunists and which keeps everything
within the bounds of the bourgeois parliamentary republic. 
</p>

<p>
We, however, shall break with the opportunists; and the entire
class-conscious proletariat will be with us in the fight - not to
"shift the balance of forces", but to overthrow the bourgeoisie, to
destroy bourgeois parliamentarism, for a democratic republic after the
type of the Commune, or a republic of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'
Deputies, for the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat. 
</p>

To the right of Kautsky in international socialism there are trends such
as <em>Socialist Monthly</em> in Germany (Legien, David, Kolb, and many others,
including the Scandinavian Stauning and Branting), Jaures' followers and
Vandervelde in France and Belgium; Turait, Treves, and other
Right-wingers of the Italian Party; the Fabians and "Independents" (the
Independent labor Party, which, in fact, has always been dependent on
the Liberals) in Britain; and the like.  All these gentry, who play a
tremendous, very often a predominant role in the parliamentary work and
the press of their parties, repudiate outright the dictatorship of the
proletariat and pursue a policy of undisguised opportunism.  In the eyes
of these gentry, the "dictatorship" of the proletariat "contradicts"
democracy!! There is really no essential distinction between them and
the petty-bourgeois democrats. 
</p>

<p>
Taking this circumstance into consideration, we are justified in drawing
the conclusion that the Second International, that is, the overwhelming
majority of its official representatives, has completely sunk into
opportunism.  The experience of the Commune has been not only ignored
but distorted.  far from inculcating in the workers' minds the idea that
the time is nearing when they must act to smash the old state machine,
replace it by a new one, and in this way make their political rule the
foundation for the socialist reorganization of society, they have
actually preached to the masses the very opposite and have depicted the
"conquest of power" in a way that has left thousands of loopholes for
opportunism. 
</p>

<p>
The distortion and hushing up of the question of the relation of the
proletarian revolution to the state could not but play an immense role
at a time when states, which possess a military apparatus expanded as a
consequence of imperialist rivalry, have become military monsters which
are exterminating millions of people in order to settle the issue as to
whether Britain or Germany - this or that finance capital - is to rule
the world.
