			"title": "Trump can prove Obama wrong",
			"body": "There is a very simple way for Donald Trump to prove himself right and Obama wrong. He can order that all relevant material surrounding the potential wiretapping of his phones in Trump Tower be declassified and made public.  \n\nAs president, he has the executive power to decide on classifying or declassifying information. This executive privilege has been established and held up by the courts and gives the president great leeway in choosing what should become public or be kept secret.  \n\nFor President Trump, who often appears to overestimate his presidential powers, being the sole decider and arbiter of America's secrets might have a certain appeal as he could use it to highlight his personal power. Moreover, proving his predecessor wrong would not only publicly humiliate Obama, but could also get him in potential legal trouble. Both are tactics Trump publicly deployed repeatedly during the election campaign.  \n\nSo instead of lamenting on Twitter about his alleged victimisation at the hands of Obama, President Trump could and should simply order the release of all the relevant material regarding potential wiretapping and surveillance of Trump Tower. Given that from Trump's perspective releasing the material appears to only have an upside, not doing so would beg the obvious question: why not?",
