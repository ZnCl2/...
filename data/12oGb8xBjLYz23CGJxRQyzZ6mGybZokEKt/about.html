	    <h1>What is ZeroISR?</h1>
	    <div class="txt">
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The primary aim of ISR is that everyone everywhere will always be able to access important software for their day to day life. This means that if the videolan website dies forever, or for some reason is compromised (think hackers or censorship), there will always be at least one verified genuine installer for VLC on ISR.<br>
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The secondary reason is more due to the hacker/censorship/NSA sort of thing. We hope (yes, just hope) that the software we all know and love is not compromised at the moment. We can support this hope by the fact the many people across the world are using the same file as us. The reason this makes us feel better is that if, say, the NSA built a backdoor into bitmessage, they likely wouldn't do that for servers outside the US. Instead, they would more likely just redirect US website visitors to their own page, complete with compromised download.<br>
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is why the file hashing is important. It tells us that we aren't being sent a fake file (or at least everyone is, but we hope that's less likely). For all intents and purposes, going to the official site to download might still be a good idea if you are able. Then take that link and cross check the hash against our table.<br>
	      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So to summarize, ISR is here to make sure everybody is able to get their hands on untampered important software.
