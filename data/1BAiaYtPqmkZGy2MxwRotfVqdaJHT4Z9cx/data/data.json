			"body": "ZeroNet may not be what we use in the future, but the concepts being developed within are going to be crucial. \n\nThe decentralized system, which now easily works over the TOR network, will allow anyone with a modest data connection (or no data connection at all in some cases, more on that later) to participate in a global community with little knowledge. No accounts need be created, no identifying information needs to be given out. Being a ghost on ZeroNet is easy - but you're not invisible.\n\nI am currently running a very poor seed node - probably totally misconfigured and insecure - Currently up to 100 sites seeded. I'm working on the search function. Anyone with page lists or willing to share their data folder would be appreciated. "
