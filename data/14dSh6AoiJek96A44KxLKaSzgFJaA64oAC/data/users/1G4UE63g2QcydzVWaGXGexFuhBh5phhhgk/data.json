The core packagers refuse to properly implement package security, something Debian-Security team has done better (not best). Operation Orchestra? We're talking downloading over HTTP, no hash checks, no GPG. You just download random binaries from \"Trusted Users\". These users have been known to get hacked themselves. Many of the packages they distribute to you are built outside of clean chroots. Anyone can apply to be a TU, and no one would stop them. If you are able to write a simple script for AUR, chances are you can apply for TU and gain access to the binary [community] repo.\n> There is a project helping to fix that, but it hasn't gained much traction:https://nicohood.github.io/LSD/\n\nWell, security wasn't something I was looking into, so I didn't write anything about it. Thanks for bringing the topic up. I'll look into it and maybe write about it if there's something worth mentioning. It's definitely something that doesn't make Arch look good.",
