The core packagers refuse to properly implement package security, something Debian-Security team has done *better* (not best). [Operation Orchestra?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwcl17Q0bpk) We're talking downloading over HTTP, no hash checks, no GPG. You just download random binaries from \"Trusted Users\". These users have been known to [get hacked themselves](https://twitter.com/farseerfc). Many of the packages they distribute to you are built outside of clean chroots. Anyone can apply to be a TU, and no one would stop them. If you are able to write a simple script for AUR, chances are you can apply for TU and gain access to the binary [community] repo.\n\nThere is a project helping to fix that, but it hasn't gained much traction:\nhttps://nicohood.github.io/LSD/",
