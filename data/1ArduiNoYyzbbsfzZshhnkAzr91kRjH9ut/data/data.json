Source: [dummies.com](http://www.dummies.com/programming/electronics/electronics-safety-rules/)\n\n*   Never work on a circuit while power is applied.\n\n*   Do not connect power to a circuit until the circuit is finished and you have carefully checked your work.\n\n*   If you smell anything burning, immediately disconnect the power and examine your circuit to find out what went wrong.\n\n*   Keep your work area dry.\n\n*   Always wear safety goggles.\n\n*   Be careful around large capacitors; they can continue to hold voltage long after they are disconnected from power.\n\n*   Be especially careful when you solder because a hot soldering iron can easily burn you.\n\n*   Always work in a well-ventilated space.\n\n*   Have safety equipment such as a fire extinguisher, a first-aid kit, and a phone nearby."
