			"description": "Abstract- Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene have already shown beneficial effects on negative, positive and general psychopathology symptoms in postmenopausal women with schizophrenia. The purpose of the present investigation was to assess the efficacy of raloxifene as an adjuvant agent in the treatment of men with chronic schizophrenia in an 8-week double-blind and placebo- controlled trial. In a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study, forty-six male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (DSM-IV-TR), were randomized to either raloxifene (120 mg/day) or placebo in addition to risperidone (6 mg/day) for eight weeks. The assessment was performed using the positive and negative symptom scale (PANSS) at baseline, and at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. Extrapyramidal symptom rating scale (ESRS) at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS) at baseline and week 8 were also used to assess extrapyramidal symptoms and depression simultaneously. Forty-two patients completed the trial. The raloxifene group showed significantly greater improvement on the negative subscale (P<0.001), the general psychopathology subscale (P=0.002) and total PANSS score (P<0.001) in comparison to the placebo group at the endpoint. There was no significant difference in the reduction of positive symptoms score between the two group (P=0.525). Extrapyramidal symptom rating scale and Hamilton depression rating scale and frequency of other adverse effects were comparable between two groups.\nThis study indicates raloxifene as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for chronic schizophrenia in men."

			"description": "\nAbstract: How the brain constructs one’s inner sense of gender iden- tity is poorly understood. On the other hand, the phenomenon of phantom sensations — the feeling of still having a body-part after amputation — has been much studied. Around 60% of men experience a phantom penis post-penectomy. As transsexuals report a mismatch between their inner gender identity and that of their body, we won- dered what could be learnt from this regarding innate gender-specific body image. We surveyed male-to-female transsexuals regarding the incidence of phantoms post-gender reassignment surgery. Addition- ally, we asked female-to-male transsexuals if they had ever had the sensation of having a penis when there was not one physically there. In post-operative male-to-female transsexuals the incidence of phan- tom penises was significantly reduced at 30%. Remarkably, over 60% of female-to-male transsexuals also reported phantom penises. We explain the absence/presence of phantoms here by postulating a mis- match between the brain’s hardwired gender-specific body image and the external somatic gender. Further studies along these lines may provide penetrating insights into the question of how nature and nur- ture interact to produce our brain-based body image."
