			"body": "> [pycole](#comment_1_1KwTTgPRSTHFmmJAFBt6kQfdyNeSM5KJuH): One Interesting idea to go along with this: Near the end, Neo wakes up from the matrix while the ship is under siege. He's able to stop a drone in midair--In real life--which makes zero sense. Here's the twist that would have made this amazing: a second matrix. The first would be the one the resistance knows as 'the matrix', the second would be the shitty wasteland they call real life.This could have been the absolute king of genius twists. It would have been amazing if taken advantage of -- But that scene is just never explained. Warner Bros done goofed. :/\n\nNot bad like twists. :)",
