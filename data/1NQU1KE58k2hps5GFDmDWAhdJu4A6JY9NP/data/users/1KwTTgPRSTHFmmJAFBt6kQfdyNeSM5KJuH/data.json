He's able to stop a drone in midair--_In real life_--which makes zero sense. Here's the twist that would have made this amazing: a second matrix. The first would be the one the resistance knows as 'the matrix', the second would be the shitty wasteland they call real life. \nThis *could have* been the absolute king of genius twists. It would have been amazing if taken advantage of -- But that scene is just never explained. Warner Bros done goofed. :/\n",

If you want to do it the easy way, you can just copy the newest source code from zeroblog, then re-add your posts. You could also re-clone zeroblog and copy everything over, too.\n\nIf you need any help, zeromail me. I might be able to help some.",
