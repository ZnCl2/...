      The Rainmaker H2O matrix featured here is unique among
      vortex-basis "water structuring" technology, in that it employs a
      spherical matrix that is arranged in an offset pattern of threes.
      It provides the highest level of impact, physically (surface
      area), geometrically, dimensionally, and energetically. In order
      to bring energy in "from the vacuum," one must open doors.
      Vortexes, or wormholes, represent the door to the abundant
      storehouse of energy that is always available when we know how to
      use the key.<br>
      <br>
      The vortex is just one of the elements that make the Rainmaker H2O
      technology special...<br>
      <br>
      Silica spheres are intentionally charged with beneficial
      electromagnetic frequencies during every step of the manufacturing
      process. Our production facility is located in a remote area of
      South Dakota, far removed from sources of material and energetic
      pollution. The silica spheres are treated with full-color LED
      lights in addition to subtle energy frequencies from marine plants
      and proteins using a scalar wave generator.<br>
      <br>
      The water is literally transformed by the energy it absorbs as it
      passes through the vortex chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The water molecules interact with and exchange electromagnetic
      information and energy with the silica matrix thereby becoming
      electrically charged.<br>
      <br>
      Rotation of the water through the toroidal vortex not only
      structures the water, but also creates a biomagnetic field which
      further enhances the potency of the life-giving elements, minerals
      and energy frequencies it contains.<br>
      <br>
      The "Rainmaker" Is The World's First Full Spectrum Natural EMF
      Water Energizer!<br>
      <br>
      <i>What is a Full Spectrum Natural EMF Water Energizer?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      A water device designed to energize water via Vortex Flow and
      Electromagnetic Frequency Transfer.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Why Do I Need A Full Spectrum Natural EMF Water Energizer?</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Natural electromagnetic frequencies are carried by water into the
      cells of plants, animals and humans to clean, feed and protect all
      life forms.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Frequency Transfer Explained</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      Each natural element of the Periodic Table within the Rainmaker
      has a specific role to play in supporting and enhancing life
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      Each mineral, crystal and sonic waveform encased within the
      pressurized wrap that surrounds the vortex chamber of the water
      unit has a role to play in cell support.<br>
      <br>
      As water flows through the Triangular Vortex Flow unit equipped
      with the Pressurized Mineral Wrap, it is transformed into a
      structured state ideally suited for absorbing the full array of
      information contained within the mineral wrap.<br>
      <br>
      What is taking place within the unit is a literal wireless
      information download into the water as the water passes through
      the energized chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The download of information represents the transfer of light
      energy which emanates from the chamber into the water.<br>
      <br>
      The information is the energy signature of each substance
      contained within the chamber and each substance has a particular
      frequency which represents it's function. This amazing process
      takes place without the water ever coming into physical contact
      with the mineral wrap.<br>
      <br>
      The phenomena of frequency transfer is the natural means by which
      all matter in its various forms receives, stores and transmits
      information which travels from one source to another via
      electromagnetic waves.<br>
      <br>
      These waves of energy can be measured to determine their frequency
      which indicates the source and type of information being
      transmitted.<br>
      <br>
      This is the means by which cells are able to communicate with such
      speed and efficiency. It is a principle which has been proved,
      confirmed and verified by renowned scientists around the world.
      (See our research page for reference material).<br>
      <br>
      Science reveals that cells are sustained, energized and repaired
      via light energy which is carried into all life forms by food and
      water as well as via energy emanations from all forms of matter
      on, below and above the earth.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the "Rainmaker" is harnessing light energy emanating
      from the pressurized (turbo charged) chamber thus optimizing the
      volume, diversity and quality of light energy being carried into
      plants, animals, soils and people resulting in increased
      productivity and health.<br>
      <br>
      The "Rainmaker" is a significant improvement over all previous
      water structuring units designed and built by Greenfield Naturals.<br>

      Enhances water's natural ability to hydrate and nourish cells and
      tissues, providing superior health and productivity for plants,
      animals and people while reducing the amount of water needed.<br>
      <br>
      Farmers and ranchers have long known of the positive effects of
      rainwater on their fields. The Rainmaker™ mimics one of nature’s
      greatest miracles of natural cleansing and regeneration. We have
      created the same revitalizing effect the earth's atmosphere has on
      rainwater. When it rains, some of the molecules of water (H2O) are
      changed into natural peroxide (H2O2), hydronium (H3O) and ozone
      (O3). Peroxide is water with an extra oxygen atom attached to it.
      Hydronium is water that has an extra hydrogen atom attached to it
      and ozone is an oxygen molecule with an extra oxygen atom attached
      to it.<br>
      <br>
      Although rarely discussed in the general or scientific literature,
      it is the presence of "hydrogen," that is the real determinant of
      cellular pH, also known as the acid/alkaline balance, a vital
      component in the health of all plants, animals and people
      everywhere on the earth. In addition, the extra supply of hydrogen
      ions attract vital, life-restoring and life-sustaining energy and
      information from the natural environment, with the bulk water
      (H2O) acting, in effect, like a "carrier wave."<br>
      <br>
      Ozone is one of nature's greatest cleansers and sanitizers that
      de-activates bacteria and viruses 3125 times faster and 50% more
      efficiently than chlorine. This allows for the control of common
      bacteria like E. coli, as well as fecal coliforms, viruses, fungi,
      mold, mildew and cysts. Unlike chlorine, however, which produces
      trihalomethane (a toxic chemical by-product), ozone is not
      carcinogenic. In fact, it is extremely beneficial.<br>
      <br>
      Water is the very substance of life and oxygen is its breath. As
      stated above, oxygen-rich, life-giving rainwater is loaded with
      natural ozone and peroxide that are both found in the chlorophyll
      of plant greens you eat. Water in this form oxygenates and
      revitalizes your plants as well as your body.<br>
      <br>
      Human impact on the soil has increased across the globe. In the
      course of trying to provide a favorable environment for life,
      people everywhere have manipulated nature resulting instead in
      serious damage to the entire ecosystem. The Rainmaker™ helps to
      reverse these negative effects by providing more available
      life-enhancing water and nutrients for your plants which results
      in far higher nutrient density and much greater crop yields.<br>

      reduced in width at half maximum (75.0Hz), 15 minutes after
      soaking significantly reduce its width 17O NMR signal at half
      maximum (46.9Hz), with the increase of immersion time thereafter
      17O NMR signal which is substantially no change in the half width
      of the peak (30 minutes and 60 minutes and when respectively
      46.9Hz 45.5Hz); reference source of water for 5 minutes after
      which the half width 17O NMR signal is likewise reduced (77.5Hz),
      thereafter as immersion time 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 17O NMR
      minutes into the half band width of the signal continues to slowly
      decrease (respectively 75.2Hz, 71.6Hz and 67.7Hz).<br>

        <b>Feeding method of using spectrum water to improve quality of
          poultry meat</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a feeding method of using spectrum water
      to improve the quality of poultry meat, relating to the technical
      field of poultry breeding. The feeding method of using spectrum
      water to improve the quality of poultry meat is a healthy, safe
      and green feeding method, multi-purpose spectrum water is used,
      and the following materials are used for feeding: chicken feed,
      young chicken feed, cracked corns, green feed, complete formula
      meat duckling feed, extruded full-fat soy flour, egg shell powder,
      defatted rice bran, wheat bran, EM (effective microorganism)
      original solution and the like. The quality of meat of poultry fed
      according to the method in the application can be improved
      effectively, subcutaneous fat of chickens and ducks can be
      reduced, and muscles of chickens and ducks can be thicker and
      stronger. Since the beneficial microorganism EM original solution
      is added, offensive smell of poultry is reduced greatly, the taste
      is good, and nutrition is richer. The immunity of chickens and
      ducks fed with the spectrum water can be improved, diseases can be
      reduced, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and the like are not
      needed, the cost is reduced, and the method can be easily
      implemented.<br>
