      <p><i>Abraham Eleazar the Jew</i>, a Prince, Priest, and Levite,
        Astrologer and Philosopher, sprung from the root of Abraham,
        Isaac and Jacob, wish my brethren, who through the anger of the
        Great God, lie scatted her and there throughout the world and
        are caught in servitude, much success and happiness in the Name
        of the soon coming Messiah and of the great Prophet Elias, who
        has already prepared all his brethren. Deni, Adonai, Bocitto,
        Ochysche 60 F, therefore wait in patience until the Hero comes.
      </p>
      <p>Marantha however, over all and sundry, not of the tribe of
        Judah, who receive this book into their hands, that such must be
        destroyed and perish, as the company of Korah, Dathan, Abiram
        and perish or vanish in the Fire. </p>
      <p>Book II, Esdras, Chapter 14, Verses 39-47 </p>
      <p>And I opened my mouth and saw there was reached to me a full
        basin, this was full as it were of water, its color however like
        unto fire, and took and drank, and as I had drank out of it,
        then was my heart troubled in the understanding and in my breast
        grew Wisdom, then my spirit was got with good remembrance, and
        my mouth was opened, and was henceforth not shut. </p>
      <p>The Highest gave also to the 5 men understanding and they wrote
        that which was said in the night, and what otherwise was above
        their comprehension, and they did not know. </p>
      <p>During the night they ate bread, I however spoke over the day
        and did not keep silence also during the night. </p>
      <p>There were however during the 40 days written 204 books, and it
        happened as the 40days were over, the Lord spake and said, the
        first books which you have written place openly that they be
        read by worthy and unworthy. The last 70 however keep, which
        thou for the wise of the people are entrusted with, for in these
        is the Wellspring of Understanding and a Well of Wisdom and a
        River of Knowledge and I did so. </p>
      <p>Dear Brethren: </p>
      <p>The Need and anxiety has mounted high, and the burden to great,
        that they nearly almost all crushed us into the dark grave,
        where all consolation ends, because we must complain day and
        night, that the Lord forsakes us, and in his righteous anger
        banishes us from his Sanctuary, which waste, and the heathen
        were called in for abuse, and we be destroyed here and there
        with mockery and scorn, under pure pressure lie under servants
        of the heathen and unbelievers, and must endure from such all
        troubles, so contrived. As there is nobody, who would be zealous
        for the law and the Sanctuary. </p>
      <p>Therefore, dear brethren, have I thought on you a little again
        to raise, and to give again a consolation in your oppression;
        even to give a pattern, and as yet again help you, and raise up,
        and when the Hero comes set at defiance your enemies, and the
        soon coming Messiah with joy triumphant be able to receive JHVH
        who will lead you out through his predecessor and messenger the
        Elias, then will all your enemies lie at the footstool of your
        feet. </p>
      <p>Then shout thou forsaken one, that those who oppressed thee,
        those will be destroyed with Fire, those however who did you
        good, will submit themselves to you at the time. </p>
      <p>Guard yourself, however, that you do not engage with such, for
        they must bear the load of the Lord. Make yourself however
        liable for servants and maids; separate them among you, in order
        that their seed cease and die out. Yes they will be your wood
        and water carriers according to the words of the Lord. </p>
      <p>Therefore have patience and suffer all oppressions. Avoid
        however also and shun all vice. Hold to the one God of Abraham,
        Isaac and Jacob, and think how often that the Lord has freed you
        from your enemies, that, where you hold to him that finally your
        heartbreak came to him, that he freed you from the disgrace of
        the slanderer, because they say in Psalm 95 v. 2. Where is their
        God? Who does not recognize you. He will not otherwise be able
        than on his Covenant to remember, according to his promise, and
        a deliverance from Salem send; the Messiah will destroy and
        drive away, all the kings of the heathens before us, and
        conquer. Then will we with him reign, when he will then gather
        us from all the four ends of the World. </p>
      <p>He will become our King and Messiah, be praised who comes there
        in the name of the Lord. Hosannah to the King! In order that you
        now in such oppression may have a consolation, so take yet the
        words of the great Prophet Jeremiah, to you in Cap. 5, v. 1 seg.
        With groans in your hearts, when the same in his misery
        furnishes, Lord think on us and our disgrace! Behold and look
        how it goes with us! Our inheritance is lost, and to the
        strangers becomes a portion! Our houses have they robbed us of,
        our mothers have become widows, and we forsaken orphans, who
        without father, and when we drink water and would have wood, we
        must pay for it. We are despised, and tired from care, yet is of
        the driving and anxiety no end. Ah! Our sins, which we commenced
        with our fathers press us. Our fathers are vanished, and we must
        yet bear their burden. Ah! The heathen press us about the neck,
        we are obliged to serve Assyria and have no salt to our bread.
        Ah! The hero bends not, when he in his anger grows furious, so
        spares he not to the 3rd and 4th generation. But then will he
        cease, when he will see that servants rule over us, he will
        rescue us from their hands, that we must not eat our bread with
        tears, as it were a theft. Ah! That the sword shall not eat up
        our enemies, for we are few, and must die of starvation, and
        become as the dead. </p>
      <p>Our virgins they make servants and deflower such before our
        eyes, our old men and princes are wretchedly by them murdered.
        Out young men are put to death under the burden. The boys have
        sunk under the burden of wood. Also the place is no more
        existing, where our ancients sat, our harps have disappeared.
        Our head stands uncovered. The crown has been stolen from us.
        Our eyes become dim, because our heart is full of care. Ah pity
        us, that our enemies are so great. The foxes run over the
        mountain of Zion, which by the heathen there must lie waste. Ah!
        Lord! Who eternally remainest and whose Lordship is without end,
        thou will even now not quite forget us. For we have become a
        derision to our enemies in all 4 ends of the world. Dost thou
        not hear our cry? Wilt thou not eternally forsake us? Lord bring
        us again to thee and to our brethren, in our home, in order that
        our days be renewed with the age. Ah! Thou art too angry with
        us! Remember us yet, and give us compassion. We must bear
        disgrace which our fathers did wrong and deserved, and made
        themselves guilty, wittingly and unwittingly, from one tribe to
        another, thy anger is even so terrible that it will not cease. </p>
      <p>Ah! Think yet on us again, and unite us with our brethren, who
        through thy hand are led out and rescued from Assyria. Now Lord
        remember, that we are thy property. Thou wilt hear us in order
        that from the enemies, to whom we are delivered, the haughtiness
        will be taken, who calumniate Thy Name and say: Your God has
        forsaken you, we will badly trouble and plague you and are
        regarded as dogs among them. Fulfill the prediction of the
        Prophet Zephaniah C.3 V. 12 seg. Which he calls in thy name. I
        will let thee remain a poor and downtrodden people because thy
        Lord thee will call. Then the wicked will cease with the remnant
        in Israel. Your mouth will no more be false and treacherous,
        without fear will thee find Rest and delight, then will Israel
        rejoice and the daughter of Zion rejoice, that their Savior and
        Rescuer has come, who releases them from their enemies. Then the
        chastiser will cease. The Messiah as thy King will then be with
        thee. Fear thee not Zion and let the hands not be tired, till
        you are again gathered in Jerusalem, for God thy Lord is with
        thee as a strong Savior, he will again be friendly to thee and
        rejoice over thee, because thy misdeeds he has forgiven and thy
        sins sealed up. Then will the Lord collect all the rest, as a
        clucking hen her chickens and one will hear the sound of the
        sack, but in all ends of the world. Then will thy tormenters
        desist form their laws, and thy disgrace will be terminated, for
        I will end it with the task-masters and release thee from the
        tormenters, and will all the lame collect from the exiles in all
        lands. I will make you before the enemies eyes be praised and
        honoured among all the people on earth. With power will I lead
        thee, says the Lord. The Prophets Malachai and Elias will I send
        to you at that time, and will gather you, ere the great day of
        the Lord comes for judgment over all heathens. Then will the
        children seek the heart of the father, and I will turn the heart
        of the father again to them, before the time comes, that the
        earth with the excommunication is smitten. Time is soon at an
        end. Dear Brethren suffer it, for it will not be long, the
        deliverance is near. In order that I make the beginning,
        therefore a consolation to you I have made possible, so have I
        here written down the secrets of our Fathers in order that the
        tribute you gave to the Romish Emperor, and you also under the
        bond of servitude can help the poor prisoners be released for
        the praise of the Holy God. Therefore will I teach thee the
        preparation of the Metals in Asophol and Diana, thereby with
        certain words and figures, of such a pattern, in order that with
        your hands you may lay hold of it, and how you shall prepare the
        Fire of the Lord, which was so lost, when the time comes to
        trouble your enemies therewith, that for your protection have it
        at hand, further will I show you the place where our fathers
        walled up and buried the secrets as Jerusalem was laid to waste
        by the emperor Titus Vespasianus, in order that you may tell
        your children, and also can show, for no heathen will find the
        place, but only the brethren. </p>
      <p>The marks stand to this hour, that even a blind man among you
        will be able to find it, but only when the great Prophet Elias
        will be present. For if you have likewise all marks you will get
        it not till this time comes. Some, it is true have already gone
        out of their wits, and have sought and found the place, but at
        opening of the same has fire sprung out, that they have partly
        perished. </p>
      <p>Therefore guard yourself, that this Book come not into your
        enemies hands, that the anger of the great God be never more
        raised over you. </p>

      <p>Thou lettest the Heathen say, where is your God, who will help
        thee? Dear brethren, therefore are we troubled to say, for we
        have become for a scorn among the Heathen, but the Lord hears us
        not, but he has bloody Vengeance on our enemies, who make a
        Murderhole out of the Sanctuary; that we also must be expelled
        from our inheritance. But the great Jehovah will not eternally
        retain anger, but will gather us shortly to receive our
        inheritance again. In order that you know when the time comes to
        be informed where our Priests and the principal secrets of the
        time have concealed away, as Titus Vespasianus the Tyrant, who
        devastated and burned the Holy City and the Sanctuary, so mark.
        There will such be found at the entrance into the Holy of Holies
        towards the East, there is a vault 500 spans deep through a
        narrow entrance, and is covered with broad hewn thin leaf like
        stone, two knee joints deep Earth thereon, then again leaf like
        stone. </p>
      <p>This is yet till this notice concealed, and will at the time
        when Elias with the Messiah comes, be found. Therefore dear
        brethren sign and groan with desire after such; for at that time
        your enemies everywhere will be extirpated. </p>
      <p>There have been some brethren who received news of this secret
        from their fathers. These have ventured, and have there gone in
        order to help their brethren. This was a good intention only;
        because such were not from the race of Judah and also the marks
        they did not understand, for they began without instruction of
        the same to work, they found it not, Had they understood the
        marks, so would they have found the concealed, if the God of
        Abraham and Isaac had not held his hand over it. In order that
        you know of the Figure and exact direction learn that which you
        in the seeking would find, certainly, so have I, as I received
        them, drawn and would discover from my fathers: Lo when you come
        to the Place and find the entrance into the same towards the
        East on the right side, so clear a way, there you will find a
        stone, which two knee joints deep lies marked also&nbsp;<img
          src="0qbl.gif" height="13" width="47">; lift this up, it lies
        200 spans deep, should the entrance have collapsed you must
        search further again, till you come to that place, there you
        will find all secrets, which our fathers possessed and from us
        you shall require. Then at this time will your enemies begin to
        badly plague you; but be comforted, you will then get the sword
        in your hands, that you may fight your enemies. In order that
        you also have a consolation, till the time comes, that you can
        come and help to loosen the poor imprisoned Brethren out of
        their bondage, so mark, what these before written figures show
        to you. You should know, that God the All Highest has promised a
        blessing, and will give it to you, that you should enjoy the
        marrow of the land and drink the dew of Heaven. </p>
      <p>For our Father says: </p>
      <p><i>Pater ejus est sol.</i> <br>
        <i>Mater Luna,</i> <br>
        <i>Ventus portavit illum in ventre suo mari</i> <br>
        <i>Sal nitre nostrum in mari mundiversum</i> <br>
        <i>Sans sublimate aeris, invisibilem, congelatum.</i> <br>
        <i>Coelum, nostrum aqua im manus non Mandefacieientem.</i> </p>
      <p>For the Spirit of the Lord is unfathomable, it hovers in the
        Air, it means the winged serpent and penetrates Man and all
        Creatures which are created on the Earth. </p>
      <p>The winged Serpent points out to the <i>Spiritus Mundi
          Universalem</i>, and penetrates all things under the heavens.
        This is our Materia, so have we also of the <i>coagulirten Air
          Repariren</i>. </p>
      <p>This is the Spirit; thus out of the Dew is drawn out, and with
        which our Salt is prepared. The undermost serpent however
        denotes our Materiam, everywhere to be found; it is earthly and
        also heavenly, then it the right Earth, <i>Virginea et Adamica</i>.
        That one however may know what it is, so is such to be found
        under the Vegetable Roots. </p>
      <p>This possesses the<i> Spirit Universalen</i> and is neither
        animal, Mineral, nor Vegetable. It is a Magnet, so it itself
        draws the <i>Proteum Universi</i> and becomes thereby a Chaos
        of the wise Artificers. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren mark the great secret that at all times the
        Perfect destroys the unseasonable, and brings it to naught, and
        in its nature changes, which both afterwards; <i>veneficio
          caloris</i> into an excellent Medicine can be elevated. That
        because their dependence is upon the <i>Semina et forma
          essentialis omnium rerum a coelo stellato</i>. </p>
      <p>On whose account also in the metal a <i>radius astrorum tangua
          parte formali</i> in the earth will be generated, so have our
        old fathers said, the Generation of all Meals <i>examiniret</i>,
        which form they names <i>ex aqua per forma interram inspissata</i>
        congeal, for the radii of the stars particularly Sol and Luna
        shine upon the Worlds continually and penetrate mediante aere et
        aqua within the same, and come in centro terra together, from
        thence they have a repercussionem aequalem through the whole
        Earth and back, but in the filtering inspisseren of the water,
        and make a salt essence thereof, which in itself anew a heavy
        flowing Substance <i>contrahirrt</i>, as the arcanus is called
        and is the first metal. This mark, for it will through the
        constant heat be driven away, which is occasioned by the stars,
        says Daniel and is also boiled out, and is Asophol. With this
        Arcanum in a form of Salt out of the mine, or also on the earth
        it also makes one and the same an acid Liquorem, which the metal
        anew into his beginning transmits, which as the first is well to
        be observed. Take therefore, what lies before your feet, and of
        yourself with your feet treat on, for Hermes says: <i>Pater
          ejus Sol, Mater Luna</i>. Will you now dear brethren with this
        fatness of the earth enjoy and drink of the dew of the heaven;
        and with the winged serpent which moves in the earth, get so
        much and with another which is without wings, know to hear, in
        order that you can unite the lower with the upper. </p>
      <p>Now hereto must you have a clean virgin Marcz, and such imbibe
        with dew as follows. When the time comes, that all begins to
        grow green and becomes a beautiful meadow, full of flowers, when
        the heaven is pure and clear, and the open air is full of lovely
        odours is swelling, pretty drops steams; very easily, when the
        Sol rises, make 2 or 3 round holes knee deep; the grass and turf
        with the flowers place on the side, the earth take out, the
        holes with other earth fill again full, and place the turf again
        thereon, in order that the mat or meadow ground get no damage,
        so have you the virgin Marcz. The red and yellow Marcz. The red
        and yellow Marcz particularly, which out of the vineyard is very
        precious thereto; also when you take them out of the hole they
        must be taken knee deep, in order that they be free from all
        roots, 24 hundred weight. That they however be not stoney, let
        such on the Mat lie spread out in order that the stars can
        therein work. This Marcz set 14 days and nights lie in clear and
        bright weather, should however rain come, cover such with thin
        wood strips or straw. When the 14 days and nights are over, and
        the Marcz is thoroughly seasoned, so let the Marcz be carried
        away in wooden vessels, and well covered. After this take a
        great cask, and make in such of straw and wood a grate; and lay
        such below in the cask, and thereon a quantity of Marcz; pour
        thereon dew, or Rain-water, taken from a thunder shower is very
        good, leave it 24 so standing, then make below on the cask a
        hole and fit a bung therein. And through it let the Water
        trickle down, till it all falls down. Pour again a fresh warm
        Water thereon, after 24 hours let it again run off. In the same
        manner proceed also with the remaining Marcz; and then pour such
        clean Water into a copper kettle, till it be quite full, and lay
        on such three parts and seethe down; pour the kettle, seethe it
        down again, till on the third part, and thus continue 10 or 12
        times, when now at last all is seethed down, and the third part
        is yet in the kettle, so pour in another clean kettle, set it
        into cold sand some days so will a Salt crystallize. This take
        thereout and preserve well in a clean vessel, the remaining
        leave again to boil down to the half, set it down again and let
        it crystallize till all is crystallized; then continue. On this
        Salt pour clean dew, in order that it will dissolve. Then filter
        it and coagulate it so often, till it is pure and crystallized
        and prepared, so have you the right Salt Marcz, which in the Sea
        of the World hovers and is concealed, without which nothing can
        be engendered and born, and also have you the fruit bringing
        Salt and the <i>prima Materialis Universal Marcz</i> prepared
        and <i>primam materiam</i> of the old Wine. </p>

        the Salt has been lixiviated, which before heat thoroughly, mix

        Rain water, place the vessel in the Sun and when it is dry,
        again, again imbibe, and so continue, in order that the Spiritus
        Aeris Universal may yet more frequently insinuate itself therein

      <p>Fill this half full, so of good material burnt, lay this in an
        oven, and another great vessel attach thereto, in which you
        before put 2 measures of distilled dew Spirit is poured, lute
        this well, and distill through Algir Fire <i>heruo termon</i>,
        humor, Algir, a Spiritum and Salt volatile, thereof you have the
        flying spirit; thus continue with fresh Materia, till you have
        from such a salt driven all the volatile Spirit. Now you must
        take this Volatile Spirit and put it in such a Vessel as is here
        represented (Figure 3). </p>

      <p>This is prepared from Acures, and place such a head thereon
        with a long nozzle, place the vessel in a Kettle, with Water
        Balnum Maria, and distill carefully all the Phlegm over,
        afterwards take it out; when it is cold and place the Vessel in
        an Alembic with sand filled up, and distill the Spirit over,
        this repeat, for his wings fail him yet, therefore, you must
        distill per se, 7 times, till it is as pure as the tears from
        the Eye, at the 7th time it give it its Salt Volatile in order
        that with it, it may rise, or lift it a part. Give finally
        strong Fire so will fly the flying Serpent, and mount up in
        white flowers, take this and let it once again rise, till it has
        become pure and transparent, and preserve it well. </p>
      <p>Then take all the matter remaining behind in the vessel,
        whereof the Spirit is driven, and bruise small, and pour
        distilled dew or Rain water thereon, and extract a Salt thereof;
        This purify so often till it becomes as beautiful and clean and
        transparent as a diamond; so have you the Serpent without Wings.
        Take care however, that you lose sight of nothing in the work,
        in order that the Pondus of Nature may fully remain. Take the
        fixed Salt, rub it small, and put it in a long glass vessel of
        Acures (Figure 4). </p>

        the flying serpent will eat the fixed one, and will out of both
        become a fiery creeping dragon; Here you have the <i>Quintuum

        Marcz; which is of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the
        earth. Gen. 27 V. 28, 29; and the life of all things which are
        created. This liquor is sweeter than sugar. </p>
      <p>In order that you my dear brethren may also further know what
        you should do with this blessed liquor, mark this. </p>
      <p>Take of Ophiris Sol 1 shekel heavy, make it into thin leaves,

        precipitate to the bottom therefrom. Then separate your clear

      <p>And give it a soft Fire Algir, which should be a B.M.,
        vapouring heat for 40 days and nights, till all has gone to
        Putrefaction, and become black, which the ancients have called
        the Crows head; then place it into the Ashes and give strong
        Algir, so that the Fire is so strong as the Sun, when it is at
        its highest; so will appear the wonder of Nature, wit all its
        colours, like to a peacocks tail, then strengthen the Algir, yet
        that it does not kindle, and appears after 40 days to the white,
        the Moon light, and enters Diana in her snow white glittering
        smock. Give it yet 40 days and nights in the 4th grade of Fire.
        Here must your vessel be concealed in the ashes, when it has
        stood in this Grade for 40 or 50 days, so will the red Lion
        appear and come to pass, like a carbuncle, yet like a yolk of an
        egg will again separate itself. This is now the right
        Quintessence of which a little piece thrown on Saturn, pierces
        it through, and makes it Sol, for it is pure Tincture. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren you shall also know, that when you dissolve Sol
        with this heavenly liquor, it is a strong medicine for all
        infirmities of the body, and as your needs require, you make
        mankind wise, because the strength of the body, it strengthens,
        and removes mankind from all need. You shall, however, dear
        brethren, know of all things, that this Universal Liquor, before
        you alloy with Asophel, must be made metallic and effective, so
        to say, as the first effect to the metallic Tincture is in two
        ways; first with Mercury Vive purified, which through the
        liquor, also becomes a Water, for it has been in the beginning
        nothing other than a Salt Water, and this is the right key when
        explained, and so place the faeces themselves, for as we
        proceed, as the Author teaches. </p>
      <p>The other manipulation however proceeds thus far. </p>
      <p>Take the <i>Mineram Saturni</i>, which is nothing other, than
        a clear volatile seed of the Sol and Luna; beat it small, when
        the same is separated from all rock, pour the liquor therein so
        will this blessed Minera dissolve in it. The clear solution pour
        off, and pour more liquor on, when all is dissolved, pour the
        clear solutions together in an Acures, place it in a cool place
        and so will wonderful crystals shoot forth; so can this
        wonderful salt in a different manner be brought to a Tincture. </p>
      <p>There is yet a way to obtain this secret, namely thus: Take the
        purified Salt before the Spiritus is driven off, and make it
        right dry, and put it in such a vessel, whereof one distills,
        place the same with the Salt in a B.M. or in Horse-dung, the
        B.M. however must be constant, and for so long till only the
        Salt itself changes into an Oily, unctuous Liquor and separates
        from all uncleanness. </p>
      <p>Pour the clear from all Faecibus, into a clean glass, and place
        it in B.M., and distill all phlegma carefully over. There will
        however be very little, and keep in such heat till it again
        coagulates, then place the glass again in fresh horse-dung to
        putrefy, and to dissolve, so will it again dissolve, and then
        again coagulate it again, and this repeat, till that only the
        Salt is fixed and in the Fire, flows like Wax without
        diminuation. When you now have it so far, keep it well
        preserved. </p>
      <p>Take Ophiris Sol and dissolve it in a Water Gaza, and when it
        is all dissolved, then distill all of it over in a glass vessel,
        and pour Water thereon, and dissolve it anew, and distill the
        Water again therefrom, repeat this oftimes, give at the last a
        strong Fire, so the Water Gaza goes mostly over, dissolve it yet
        again, and put in the solution of the Rhystone, so will the Sol
        draw it to itself. Distill the Water again therefrom till it
        turns to a powder; place this in a closed glass in the Fire, and
        so the Phyton will fly and leave the Sol, as a not solid Earth,
        quite open and porous. This Earth sweeten several times with
        clean water, and dry it, of such a powder take 1/2 shekel heavy,
        and from the above liquor or Lapide Alkahest 4 shekels heavy,
        rub it in a glass of Acures together, and put it in an Alingel,
        seal it up, that nothing can come in; place the vessel in the
        furnace, and give it Algir Fire, till it flows together to a red
        stone or powder. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren with this can you also do wonders, for it
        transmutes all known metals into Sol. </p>
      <p>When you also have the above Universal Mercury, which you have
        prepared out of the Volatile snake and the fixed, poured on the
        Albaon, so in the end such is green. </p>
      <p>For there lies in such the life of all metals and minerals as
        the right key, and this concentrated Spiritus Mundi, can in all
        things be used in exaltations <i>virtutia Elixiris de
          prolongandum vitam</i>. </p>
      <p>For Heaven and Earth are preserved through this. This is the
        right green Alazagi, with which one can do wonders, as I already
        before taught, and will show afterwards in the proper place. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, in order that before you accomplish this secret
        work and also have food and nourishment; so will I teach you
        some small primitive work which in all places you can do. Take
        melted Almusater Alatren, have it and Celuvialatel, rub it
        amongst each other, put it in a strong stone vessel, and
        sublimate up again, and repeat for the third time, and so you
        get a Gold Sublimate, which you shall also require, let 32
        shekels heavy of the pure Copper Metal, in a strong Earthen
        Vessel prepare, let this flow in a strong Fire, when flowing
        thin, add the fat sublimate 4 shekels heavy to it, let it flow
        one hour, then pour it out, so have you the great Secret thereby
        to accomplish a living. </p>
      <p>Yet must you remember this necessary manipulation, when you
        have a right fat Marcz, and with dew or Water Grandi extrahiret
        so now you boil such down, so expert that in it a Salt can
        crystallize, and on account of the great fatness and fat
        viscosity of this Salt. When you see this, so let it safely
        evaporate to a thick liquor. This liquor is far better than the
        crystals. With such you can go to work, that you mix therewith
        so much of its own thoroughly heated and lixiviated Earth, and
        then distill over, as has been taught, and so you get at once so
        much of this Volatile Spirit. </p>
      <p>The fixed salt remains behind, which can be lixiviated and goes
        in the work as said before. Guard yourself however that these
        Secrets come not into your enemies hands. </p>
      <p>Conceal it from them as you only can, till the time of
        deliverance comes. Then rejoice the forsaken daughters, that the
        Lord and Holy Adonai has made an end to your ignominy. </p>

      <p>I, Abraham Eleazar continue to teach you Dear Brethren, as our
        Fathers in the Wilderness sinned against the Lord through
        Idolatry, Moses made for them a brazen Serpent and stuck it to a
        Cross, that such would be seen by all the people, and they again
        from their merited plaque might recover. </p>
      <p>Therefore know, when you can fasten with a Golden Nail, the
        Serpent Python on his Cross, so will you want nothing in Wisdom.
      </p>
      <p>Therefore is Nature most hidden and this is the whole secret in
        the Art, that we draw out from this secret Materia the Spirit
        Phytonis and Pirthre Sol, as the Sulphureous Water, as the
        strength from Fire and Air of imperceptible form, separate with
        small trouble; therefore is it full of Spirit, and holds in
        itself a fat fruitfulness. </p>
      <p>This will now be driven out and separated, that as a clear
        Water and appears to the eye as a tear, i.e., Spiritus Mercurii.
        This loosens the common Phyton and makes it also a Water, yes to
        an Aldibid. </p>
      <p>That however you know and become acquainted with the materiam;
        so is such our old Albaon Abacschozdii, is a Minera, so there in
        the mountains is found, and such is of three different sorts.
        The first is in all its parts, is used by surgeons, it is right
        to say a volatile ore while it stands as pure Tincture or Seed,
        so however volatile, while all of the Fire is taken away, till
        very little. When such is melted it gives a little sparks. This
        is best. The other appears yellow and also with little black
        sparks, is often found in yellow gravel or sand, and has much
        auriferous volatile seed. The third is grey and white and a very
        poisonous kind, a right Saturn, which has the power, with its
        poisonous breath to kill. Therefore one must be very careful
        when working with this, when in a dry form, to get its sweat. </p>
      <p>In the wet way it is more sure, for when this old one is put
        into a bath, it betakes itself into it. Thou shalt also know
        that this old one is of a saline property, therefore such is
        dissolved only into a bad liquor, so from Kay and Salt is the
        sapient crude amalgam prepared, this is through a penetrating
        poisonous Salt, which is a pure Python, heightens the bath, that
        this old one himself should dissolve in such, till to a little,
        which the Fera of the heat of the Body is, the clear solution is
        poured off, such is put in a cold place, and so is produced the
        Old One in quite another figure, in beautiful crystals, and also
        it is with the other two preceeding particularly, but the first
        is not so poisonous. </p>
      <p>When however this Old One is placed in his bath, so will his
        body be divided and then appears its inward Salt Balsam, which,
        is pure Tincture, and this material by many, will be thrown away
        on the hills, and also such a material is found in the pits,
        because they often throw such away, because it gives from itself
        a strong smell, and also often kills the men, for the 3 sorts,
        is already of the Spiritus Mundi Universi made volatile,
        therefore such blows without intermission. </p>
      <p>The first and other Materia is not so volatile, yet has in
        itself the Spiritus Mundi buried, in this mineral essence, and
        has a right to say, is made a Magnet, and is inspissirt in full
        and free operation and in full course to become a Metal, but not
        yet to a Metal or Mineral, nevertheless form a Minerali inbutus.
      </p>
      <p>This now is the Materia, which the wise choose: </p>
      <p><i>Materia non putative, sed vera e</i> <br>
        <i>Experimentis comprebata, material</i> <br>
        <i>Saltemunica, et res, ex qua, hic alpus</i> <br>
        <i>Unice et solus absque pregrino additamento</i> <br>
        <i>Praeparari necesum habet.</i> </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, take the same, this massa which women color the
        hair, so can you in eligenda massa not miss, for without the
        Dragon Phyton can nothing be done in this Art. Therefore direct
        all your thoughts to the Phyton. Nam est un Phytone quicquid
        queerunt, Sapientes. For nothing in the world has such a power
        to destroy Metals. </p>
      <p>As the Phyton alone, but, dear brethren it is not the common
        Phyton, but our Spirit Phytonis, although with the common
        Phyton, our Spirit Phytonis is infinitum multuplicirrt, for out
        Spirit Phytonis transmutes the common into its nature, as it
        also changes the nature of Sol and all Metals, for it is the
        Primum Ens Metallorum, that is, the Spring of the Ancients, the
        flower with golden leaves and so from pulling and tearing the
        poisonous dragon is covered and preserved. </p>
      <p>Make our Old One a Heavenly Green Salt. And from such a
        Phytonis, a living water which burns not; place Ophiris Sol in
        the solvent and putrefy in order that it becomes black, white
        and red. With this you can vanquish the World. </p>
      <p>Therefore dear brethren take heed to my teaching, for I will
        reveal here a greater secret to you, and with two ways show you
        how to obtain the great Quintessence. </p>
      <p>Take our Materium Magnesiam, Plumbum Nigrum, also called
        Bismuth or Puch, such as comes from the Hills; 10 or 12 tit;
        make such an Old One into a fine powder, after you have cleansed
        all rock from it, and put this powder into several broad
        Alazabus, place these so that the Luna can shine thereon, and
        the dew may fall therein, but no sun dare shine thereon, and no
        rain come thereto, and let it stand thus 4 weeks, you must
        however move the powder round every day. When the time is past,
        take this powder, as our Old One, and put it in a crooked necked
        Acures (Figure 7). </p>

      <p>Lay such in an Alazabus filled with sand, and that the sand
        covers the Acures and place it in the Oven and give it Algir
        Fire, <i>herno, termon humor, algir, lutirt</i>, and from this
        great ball of Acures, that you can see how it goes, and distill
        a sweet, yet penetrating Spirit over, which is white, which is
        the doves of Hermetis. Continue heating till no more comes over,
        then let it cool. Take the receiver off, in which Our Old has
        concealed his Eva, take the distilled Spirit and mix with the
        residue or Caput Mortuum, and place into such a Vessel (Figure
        8). </p>

      <p>Place this vessel in the sand, up to the level of the liquid
        and distill and cohobate several times, distill this gently over
        in order that the Spirit Phytonis comes over clear like a tear,
        and is cleansed from all impurities. Reserve this Spirit and
        take the remainder or Caput Mortuum out of the crooked necked
        vessel, and put it in a vessel of burnt earth, put it into the
        Fire and calcine it strongly, then extract the Salt out of it
        with distilled water, and purify it; so have you the Adam, made
        out of the earth and prepared. </p>
      <p>Now you must make this living, and give him his Eva. Rub this
        Salt small, and put it in an Alingel, and pour the Spirit on the
        dead body and firmly stop the glass and close I well, place in a
        gentle heat, so will Adam take Eva to himself, and become one,
        and so you have here in short a Liquorem Universalem and with
        this you can rightly dissolve the Ophiris Salt, and then
        coagulatione et fixatione in verum semen suri lapidem
        philosophorum redigirre. Drear Brethren I will not withhold from
        you through the help of the All Highest how to prepare this
        secret Phytonis Liquorem; so take such a Liquorem and pour it on
        fresh Albaon made into a fine powder in a great vessel of
        Acures, shut it well, and place it in a gentle heat, and you
        will see a Smaragdine colour. Pour the Extraction together in a
        clean vessel. On the remaining Corpus pour a distilled Water,
        and extract the remaining tincture. Pour this off into another
        clean vessel, and distill off the water and add this liquor to
        the other extractions, and place this in a cool place, so will a
        Smaragdine Salt crystallize, of great strength. Take out this
        Salt remainder, leave in a mild heat, to evaporate a little, and
        again let it Crystallize, and you will get ore Salt, and you
        will have the real Green Lion of the Ancients. </p>
      <p>This is a living Salt. Take this Salt that you have extracted
        from this Earth, mix this Salt with the Earth or caput mortuum,
        rub the small, and make little balls thereof, moisten these
        balls with the liquor, so that nothing foreign is added, put
        such in a crooked necked Acures (Figure 9); lay this in an Oven
        in Sand, and your vessel should be covered with sand, lay also a
        large ball thereon and well closed, that the Arcki does not go
        through and distill over; by Algir a flowing Spirit comes over,
        pour this back into the vessel, cohobate and distill over again
        with strong Algir, then take the Receiver off, and preserve this
        well. </p>

      <p>The remaining Corpus bruise, and rub it small, and extract the
        Salt thereof, and purify it, and pour your Liquor upon it, place
        this liquor so often, till all the Salt comes over with the
        Liquor, and put this Liquor into a high Vessel (Figure 10). </p>

      <p>Distill all moisture therefrom, so you will find in Fundo a
        beautiful pure Oil as heavy as Plumbum, also pour this Spirit,
        which from its moisture you must have previously separated, upon
        your Oil, and draw off several times mildly, till your Oil is as
        thick as a flowing brook, remains behind; thus you get the Gum
        of your sister Maria, and the true Chaos of our Fathers. </p>
      <p>Then put it into a long necked Acures, and carefully melt the
        neck closed, put it in a mild heat, so will the Materia resolve
        into a crystalline Spirit and settles as a brown red earth. This
        clear water is the Columba Diana. Such pour carefully from the
        Earth and rectify, and well preserve it, i.e., lutirt that you
        clean it from all impurities, and free it from all Phlegmata.
        Let this flow over 7 times, so have you the prepared Phelgmata.
        Let this flow over 7 times, so have you the prepared Phytonis.
        This now is the life of all things. Preserve it as a great
        treasure, for this Bird does not willingly let itself be seen by
        the Godless of the World. </p>
      <p>Take the humidity or Phlegma, and extract out of our Earth the
        red Pirtre or fiery red Lion. This solution pour all together,
        till nothing more is extracted, and distill the Phlegma
        therefrom, so remains in the vessel a red glancing Materia, as a
        Blood and the right flowing Ophiris: Sol of the Ancients, the
        Blood of the Dragon, take this and preserve it well. </p>
      <p>The remaining Faeces take all together and calcine and extract
        the Salt of splendour. Clarify it that it becomes like a
        diamond. This salt rub in a clean vessel of Acures among the
        Blood of the Dragon, and pour the Columbian Dianae thereon,
        close them together and put it in a mild heat, let it stand,
        till they are all united, so you get the right lac virginis of
        the Ancients, with which one can do wonders. </p>
      <p>When now all is again a Liquorem, mediante circulatione
        redigirt, and take of this Liquor 10shekels heavy and of the
        Ophiris Sol or Luna one shekel heavy made into thin leaves, and
        put it together in an Alingel, close it hermetically, put it in
        our Oven to stand in digestion and circulation, till all is
        dissolved, then let it stand in Algir Fire, till it has gone
        through all the colours, so you will get a blood-red glittering
        Carbuncle, a very great Medicine, which is unsearchable. </p>
      <p>This is now a Ferment. Melt 4 shekels of Ophiris Sol, and let
        it flow in a good vessel of burnt Earth, place upon this 4
        shekels heavy of the Tincture, and it will penetrate the Sol,
        and change it into a blood-red essence. So is the King of the
        Ancients and the right Red nature born. </p>
      <p>Of this will 1 grain, change 1 shekel heavy of other metals
        into Gold. Or when you add Luna, in the conjunction in Kuna
        change. Then mark, when you add the Luna so you get a stone or
        Tincture on Luna, also a great Arcanum in Medicine, and the
        Tincture will appear violet glittering. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, the Ancients have not had one Way in preparing
        of this Mystery. For some, when the Columba Dianae they had
        separated from the Chaos, they have allowed it to fly 7 times,
        in order to separate from it all Phlegmate. </p>
      <p>Then you have taken this, and a purified Phyton, poured into a
        crooked necked glass, so as the Phyton is eaten by the other,
        then drive it over again, so that only the Earth remaining,
        which throw away. </p>
      <p>There have some that also raised, and have increased their
        Columba Dianae to infinitum, for if you distill it several times
        it becomes stronger. Then have you out of the red Earth, which
        Water Adamicum called, the soul, the Life, the Fire of the
        Ancients; yes, the red fiery Lion extrahirt, the Phlegma
        distilled off, till it becomes a glittering Blood which they
        name the Blood of the Purple Snail. </p>
      <p>This is to be well preserved, then take Ophiris Sol in leaflets
        and place into an Alingel, pour on the Columba Dianae so much,
        until the gold is dissolved; to this solution pour the Blood of
        the Dragon, and have brought Fire to Fire, for this is most
        hidden, and without this in the work, you could not in an
        Eternity boil out, so has this Liquor become as Blood. Then take
        the faeces, and strongly calcine, and with the Phlegmate extract
        the salt, and purify it, till it becomes clear, and like a
        Diamond, then rub it small and put it in an Alingel, and pour on
        so much of the gory Phytonis that the Salt will dissolve. The
        glass must be Hermetically sealed, and then placed in the Fire,
        and allowed to go through all the colours till the Quintessence
        has become firm, and then take it out of the fire, rub it small
        again, and sprinkle it with the fiery gory Phyton, and again
        Hermetically seal the vessel, and allow it to go through the
        colours again, and then have you found the augmentation, which
        can be practiced in infinitum. </p>
      <p>Then take of this Mystery, when it has become fluid, and have
        Ophiris Sol purified and melted with Puck Bismuth and in the
        fire allowed to fume. </p>
      <p>This is the King, which is eaten by the Wolf, and again Vomited
        forth. Place 8shekels weight of this purified Gold, and when it
        is flowing, throw in two shekels weight of the Tincture, so has
        the Sol become a clear Tincture. Of this Tincture add again 8
        half ounces of Sol and mixed together, place this mixture into a
        vessel, and pour on the fiery Dragon, place it in the Oven and
        allow it to go through all the Colours, and continue this till
        the Tincture again becomes fluid, then take this out of the
        Fire, and add a part of this Tincture with melted Sol, until all
        the fiery Liquor is consumed. Then take this Tincture out of the
        Fire, and add an equal part of melted Ophiris Sol and then of 1
        more part is necessarily employed, and then another part is
        added thereto. And then the Columba Dianae is thereon active. </p>
      <p>Others of the dear Ancients have before in the Columba Dianae
        dissolved Ophiris Sol, and have fixed and activated this Liquor
        therein, which is better, and the Work is increased in
        infinitum. Of the Tincture add 1 grain to 16 shekels weight of
        the Phyton thrown into the Fire, and so it becomes the most
        lovely Ophiris Sol. </p>
      <p>The more times the Tincture is reiterated the higher it
        becomes, even as you have assisted in the propagation, and so it
        has become a great Treasure. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren; the dear Ancients have gone another way, that
        after you get the Green Lion, as the Salt of Nature, so have
        they taken such a heavy Salt, and in the high pot (Figure 11)
        they have placed it, and closed it well, and given it a moist
        steamy heat, or placed in Horse-dung, and let this secret Salt
        stand so long until it dissolves itself into a Green Liquor,
        then they have poured this into another high glass, put a head
        thereon, with a nozzle, and hung it in the Ashes to distill,
        till the Columba Dianae began to flow, when it was all distilled
        over, they poured it back, thus distilling and cohobating till
        nothing remained behind but a brown Earth. </p>

      <p>This afterwards they extracted the Phelgm from the extracted
        Spirit, and so obtained a red fiery water, this have they put
        with each other in a clean vessel and distilled the phlegma
        thereof, till there remained a blood red Dust. Out of the
        remainder a Salt is extracted, which remainder is first
        calcined, the Salt clarified, till it became Crystallized, so
        have they the new earth prepared, then they proceeded in the
        rest of the work as before taught, and got the great Mysterium.
      </p>
      <p>Some of the dear Ancients have our Old one a bath prepared from
        the Spiritus Mercurii as formerly taught; and such with its own
        moisture (blood) dissolved and closed. </p>
      <p>Then have they prepared a Salt from such, and from such a
        volatile Spirit a blood red Oil is driven, further they have
        taken the pure Earth, in which the Brilliant Salt was concealed,
        and they poured the red Liquor thereon, and distilled and
        cohobated till all passed over. </p>
      <p>Then have they put this liquor in a clean vessel, and dissolved
        Ophiris Sol in it, the Earth they have taken out of the above
        vessel, and this Liquor poured on, only one time, this they have
        distilled off per Algir, and again poured thereon, and this so
        often continued, till nothing more rose up, then they have
        poured a fresh Liquor thereon, and then continued the work
        therein till all the Liquor remained together, fixed and flowing
        in the Fire like a Wax. </p>
      <p>This blood red salt have they alloyed with Ophiris Sol, and
        melted with each other, so has it become a Tincture, with which
        they however tinged the other Metals, and have transmuted them
        into Sol. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren our Ancients have yet further seen and taken the
        Universal Key, whose preparation likewise in the beginning was
        taught, prepared from the Spiritus Mundi Universal. </p>
      <p>This Liquor have they poured on our Old ones, which they first
        beat small, and placed each other in a Vessel of Acures, in a
        small heat, till the Liquor is tinged to a grass green colour.
        The Solution they have poured off, and another poured thereon,
        till all is extracted, they have poured the clear Solutions
        together, and distilled 1 part of the Phlegmatic Spirit off, and
        placed the vessel in a cool place, till a pretty Smaragdine Salt
        was crystallized. The remainder they have taken and distilled
        one half of it off, and placed the remainder in a cool place,
        then is there more green Salt crystallized, and the remainder
        they have reheated till all the Salt was crystallized. Then have
        they taken this Salt as a great treasure, and this is in truth
        the right Green Lion; for out of this Niter is a Spirtus
        mercurii prepared with a blood red Oil of great effect, and the
        dear Ancients have prepared in this way the great Mysterium,
        then what concerns the after work, so is such all one work. You
        may also in the wet way choose the one you wish. The after work
        in the wet way is the Menstruum Universale. </p>
      <p>Take putrefied Urine and the acetum destillatum Spirit of
        Tartar amalgam and putrefy with each other, then put Calx Vive
        in a high alembic, put a still thereon, which has a hole above,
        and well luted. When this has happened, then put the Alembic in
        sand, and give Fire, now when you think that the Alembic is
        heated, pour through a filter of the mixed Liquor, through the
        hole in the still, so will the Calx Vive be heated, you must
        however close the hole firmly and must not pour too much on the
        Calx Vive at once, otherwise it would run over (pour it on
        gradually), then will thy Spirit go over, collect it, and
        rectify it yet once per se. With this you can extract from each
        Minera its Anima, whenever you wish; the menstruum can be
        prepared without Fire, but the Calx Vive must be good, and is
        also better in the Operation, when one will prepare this, so
        instead of Urine take a strong Spirit of Tartar; <br>
        so also must everything be well rectified and clean, then it is
        practicable. </p>
      <p>With this Menstruo extract the life and Spirit out of Old
        Albaon, and according to instruction work in the Wet Way. </p>
      <p>Also have I again, dear brethren, shown a way, that you can
        assist, and come to the help of your poor brethren, who are
        otherwise in need and misery. Forsake not the poor Widows and
        Orphans. Be very reticent. Laud and Praise the name of God, His
        Holy Name Jehova. Cry, that the air resound, Hosanna, to the Son
        of David our brother, Our King, Our Deliverer, Our Saviour. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, one might well wonder, how our dear Ancients hit
        on the thought to prepare a Medicine, which has alone happened
        through the inspiration of the great Jehovah, that the Metals
        could be ripened and transmuted higher, and how therewith they
        went to work, that they found the Primum Materian. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, one says: <i>Titulus Inventionus</i> may be
        often <i>Potior Pars Inventionis</i>. </p>
      <p>As they saw that Sol and Luna were generated by so long boiling
        in the Earth of Nature, so must we freely wonder, how yet the
        dear Ancients fell on the thought, that through Art and the help
        of Nature, they could renew the way, and bring to pass by the
        Earth, Sol, Luna in such a short time. </p>
      <p>Alone the dear Ancients have learned through diligent
        speculation of Nature, what was their origin before the
        commencement, and out of What the Life of all creatures took its
        origin, and how the Generation and commencement of the Metals
        may have their Origin. This the dear Ancients have very closely
        observed, examined and found, that all metals took their origin
        ex mercury or Phythone, thence are they driven, and have taken
        the Phyton, and have also therewith gone to work. </p>
      <p>They have however experienced harm with such because it has
        become too metallic; so have they sought an other materiam, in
        which the Spirit Mercury is not yet made metallic; and found
        such likewise among the Minerals, and afterwards called this
        with divers names, as Albaon in Arabic, in Latin, Plumbum
        Nigrum, Abackhozodi, a black heavy stuff; they have also called
        it Magnesium, Bismuth. </p>
      <p>Our Ancients have called the stuff Puch, it is however not the
        common Stibium, but a black grey rock, often with white and
        other beautiful colours adorned, heavy in weight, as I already
        taught you. </p>
      <p>Will you now dear brethren go by the old road, so will I teach
        you shortly and plainly, not with many names, or in Figures, as
        the Egyptians left it behind to their children, which are not to
        be divined or unriddled, but clearly and brotherly. </p>
      <p>Formerly I have pointed out and shown to you the wet way, and
        how you can find and prepare in such a way the Mysterium, and
        such a way is without danger. </p>
      <p>This dry way, that I will describe to you and teach you, is
        somewhat dangerous, yet if you follow my teaching, then it will
        not fall heavy on you, for as I have described to you in all my
        Figures throughout, two ways, so to the intelligent it is not
        difficult to understand, and have also wished to show that in
        this Figure [3]; for here you see flowing from a desert a white
        Lunar Water, which is the old progenitor of all things, prepared
        in two ways: </p>
      <p>Firstly however, you must understand, what of the two ways is
        taken; namely the first proceeds from the Fatness of the Earth,
        out of the Primordial Chaos. The other from our black heavy
        lump; that however the serpents crawl in the grass, and is of
        divers colors, the Phyton in the dry way, for this promptus is
        very poisonous, yet some times it ascends in the hills, and so
        becomes a flower, nearly medicinal, whilst then it is not so
        poisonous. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, take our hard lumps, and make them into an
        inconceivable powder. Mix this powder with some small broken
        stones amalgam, so that in the sublimation, the powder does not
        melt, place this in a Pot, as you see, and have a small Oven
        (Figure 12). </p>
      <center>

        <p><b>Figure 12</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The pot must be of good burnt earth, on this put a great glass
        head, and place a vessel before and give Fire, yet that the
        Vessel is high up in the oven; when you see, that no more steam
        rises, then open a Register, Mark, that you do not lute the
        vessel, for otherwise it would be dangerous. When all the vapour
        is gone, open the other Register, then will the white flower
        mount up, or the Bird of Hermes, as the Egyptians call it. Stop
        the Fire, yet take heed, that the material melts not, thus you
        should before mix something among the Materiam, that it does not
        melt. </p>
      <p>Should the head become full of flowers, you must proceed till
        nothing rises up, take the flowers from the heads and preserve
        well. If there goes a little Liquor over, wash out the flowers
        from the head with this Liquor, for you have its life in such. </p>
      <p>In such a manner you can make as many flowers as you wish, and
        when you have a pretty tolerable portion, gather them together
        and preserve them. </p>
      <p>I say again, guard yourself, that you do not destroy the
        flowers with too strong of a heat. </p>
      <p>Take again a fresh Materiam, rub therein all your ascended
        Materiam, place this in the vessel, and place the head again
        thereon, give the Fire carefully, then will more flowers ascend,
        when the head is full, take it off. These flowers can be
        prepared also in this annexed vessel, that one puts several
        heads, one over the other, for otherwise, when the head is full,
        you must take it off, and put another thereon, which causes much
        annoyance in the work, and many flowers are lost. </p>
      <p>Continue this till all the flowers have ascended, then bring
        all the flowers together into the distilled Liquor, put fresh
        Materiam into the vessel, and sublime the flowers, and so
        continue until you have released the Phytone from 12 tit of the
        Materiam: i.e., when you have the flowers from 12 tit of the
        Materiam, you have enough. Then from our Albaon ascends the
        most, the remaining Materiam preserve well. Take all the flowers
        together, and weigh them, when you have 1 tit in weight, proceed
        thus. </p>
      <p>Take Luna and shut it up in a strong Water prepared from Kali
        potash and Salt Earth. When it is thus shut up, then pour Water
        thereto, in which common Salt is dissolved, then will the Luna
        be precipitated, which sweeten well with Water and make dry;
        take of this 16 shekels heavy, rub the precipitated Luna with
        1/2 of the flowers and being well mixed place this in a vessel
        of Acures, place in the Oven, as above mentioned in Sand, and
        heat it carefully (Figure 13). </p>

        <p><b>Figure 13</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Then will the flowers ascend much prettier and clearer than in
        the commencement, and a Spirit like Water will go over. Take
        your sublimed flowers, rub them again among the remainder and
        sublime it 4 times more, then it becomes like a diamond, and is
        not so poisonous. The remainder can be melted and purified and
        thus recover the Luna that is left; or you can sublime the
        Columba Dianae 2 times more, then will they get a great
        brilliance; take this up for it is now already Medicinal, and no
        more poisonous. The other half of the flowers, as you above
        preserved, take and make with the Water Gaza out of the Ophiris
        Sol, a Dust, which sweeten well, rub it among the flowers and
        bring it into a vessel, and do, as you were shortly before
        taught, and let this rise also 4 times from the Fecibus, then
        let it rise two times more, then have you the Phytons golden
        winds prepared, and then is ready the noble flower Chelidonis;
        then have the Ancients taken the Residuum, and burnt to ashes;
        out of these ashes they have prepared a Salt, which was clear
        and clean; this they have rubbed small and weighted; with 6
        shekels heavy of this Salt, they have rubbed 2 parts of these
        flowers, and put it in an Alingel, and placed this in an Oven in
        Sand, and let it stand in Algir Fire, and in a short time has
        the Black One appeared, and then it goes through all the colours
        to a White Stone. This they have taken out, and rubbed again 1
        part therein of the Columba Dianae, and again put it in the
        Oven. This they have repeated 7 times, then they have let flow
        four shekels of Luna, and then thrown into it 2 shekels of the
        Tincture, and let it flow well, and so have they got a Tincture
        to transmute other metals into Luna, and 1 grain will transmute
        12 to 16 shekels of other metals into Luna; Also they have
        proceeded with the golden flowers, and have gotten the Red
        Tincture, to tinge other metals into Sol. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, the Ancients have seen and found yet another
        way; they have dried up the flowers from its own Corpus 6 to 7
        times, till these flowers have become glittering and pure. Then
        they have taken and weighed them, and rubbed them with the
        flowers of Phythoana Anima, and put this together into a vessel,
        and sublimed in a mild Fire, so has one Phyton the other
        swallowed up, mounted out and up. </p>
      <p>This they have taken out and let ascend alone aloft per se, so
        have they obtained the Phyton of the Wise Masters, and then
        multiplied it. This they have named their White Flower. Which
        however the Ancient s understood nothing, and it is not true,
        that one could increase with the Phytone alone, for they have
        taken the Residuum, and calcined this to the half, and from this
        prepared a Salt, this Salt they mixed among the other uncalcined
        Materiam, and placed this in a good vessel of burnt Earth, then
        have they melted it with each other, and after the first part
        evaporated, got a brown red Acures, this have they rubbed small,
        and weighed, and rubbed again 1 part of this Acures with 3 parts
        of the white flower, and put with one another in a vessel, and
        let ascend, and this have they repeated till the white flower
        ascended red (Figure 14). </p>

      </center>
      <p>This they have named the red Lion and also their Sol, for the
        Pietre out of the Acures has jointly ascended, and this they
        have alone preserved, as also 1 part of the Acures. </p>
      <p>The remainder have they taken, and calcined with strong Fire,
        and made a clarified Salt out of it; then they rubbed the Acures
        therein, and also the red Flowers, and put such in a stone
        vessel of burnt Earth, and put this in the Fire, and let the
        Fire commence slowly, so has the red Flower flown jointly, then
        have they continually struck the vessel, and taken this out
        clean, and rubbed it small, and preserved it. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, when you have come so far, then you have the
        Tincture in the Oven Fire cleaned and multiplied (Figure 15). </p>

        <p><b>Figure 15</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>You have taken a vessel, as I have shown, of good burnt earth,
        and put such into the fire; take 4 parts of the red flower, and
        1 part of the white Phytonis, rubbed amongst each other in a
        vessel of Agate and Acures, put into the crucible, so has the
        red flower spread over the white one, and with great luster with
        each other allied and dissolved, and made also your Tincture in
        little time; then have you taken the vessel out of the Fire, and
        such laid down, and carefully picked it all out; and then again
        rubbed small, and rubbed amongst 4 parts to 1 part of the
        Columba Dianae and then melted, and thus you have repeated 7
        times, and then you must cease, because your Tincture is liquid,
        and it penetrates all vessels; of this take 4 parts, and carried
        such to 8 parts of Ophiris Sol, and so it becomes a red
        penetrating Stone. </p>
      <p>This you have divided into 2 parts, and rubbed 1 part among 2
        parts of the penetrating Tincture and also put therein of the
        Columba Dianae, and then melted with each other, and repeated
        this 7 times, then have you augmented your Tincture in
        Infinitum; the half you reserved of this Tincture melted with
        Sol, you have employed for your maintenance, for 4 grains of
        this Tincture transmutes 16 shekels heavy of other metals in
        flux into most beautiful Sol. </p>
      <p>You have also prepared your Tincture, with the white Flower per
        se, or with the addition of the fabricated Luna, the most you
        have only prepared per se, and increased with the Phytone, and
        then have you taken Ophiris Sol, and made it into and
        incomprehensible Dust, well sweetened, of this you have taken 1
        shekel heavy, and 2 shekels of the Columba Dianae rubbed
        thereon, and placed this in the Alingel, or into another vessel
        as here stands Marked (Figure 16). </p>

      <p>This vessel is closed well together, and place this vessel in
        an Oven placed in sand, and let it sand till the Columba Dianae
        has ascended, then take out the vessel, and rub the Ascended
        again amongst the Lowest, and thus repeated so often, till it
        has flown together firm. </p>
      <p>Then take this Red Tincture out, and again rub therein 1 part
        of the Columba Dianae, and this again put into the vessel and
        make it firm, and this should be repeated 3 times. </p>
      <p>Then must you cease, because the Tincture has become so
        penetrating; take this out and weigh it, and let 1 part of the
        Tincture flow with 4 parts of Sol, and so the Sol will become
        pre Tincture; from this Tincture put in 1/2 of it again and so
        proceed as before taught, with the other half you can transmute
        the base Metallica into Sol, 1 grain tinges 10 shekels heavy
        into Sol. </p>
      <p>Yet a narrow and secret way have the Old Ancients proceeded.
        After you have prepared the white flowers, as the Columba
        Dianae, so have they caused them to ascend from the calcined
        Faecibus, till it has become in some degree auriferous. </p>
      <p>Then they have calcined the Residuum strongly, and extracted
        the Salt with distilled Water, purified and crystallized. </p>
      <p>Such Salt they have rubbed small and rubbed 4 half ounces Salt
        to 1 half ounce of fine beaten Ophiris Sol, and melted them,
        they got a blood red Sol, of this they have taken 4 parts, and
        rubbed therein 1 part of Columba Dianae, and put this into such
        a vessel (Figure 17) and such well preserved, put into our oven
        in sand, and let stand so long, till it was incorporated. Then
        they have taken it out again, and rubbed 1 part of the Columba
        Dianae, and put again into the double vessel, placed in sand,
        and then proceeded, till the 7th time. </p>
      <center>

        <p><b>Figure 17</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This Tincture they have fused with Ophiris Sol, of this they
        reserved half, the other half is mixed with 1 part of the
        Columba Dianae, and thus repeated 7times.This Tincture is more
        penetrating than the one before. </p>
      <p>The nature is most hidden, for the dear Ancients from
        illumination of the great Jehovah saw yet further, and prepared
        their Tincture in such a manner. </p>
      <p>Thus they manufactured their white flowers, and so do they have
        all the Liquorem, which they changed, preserved and collected; </p>
      <p>The white Flowers have they purified, by simple progressing,
        till they appeared like a diamond; such have they raised, or
        with the flowing Phyton united, and again sometimes ascended
        with each other, then they have raised up this poisonous reptile
        and Dragon. </p>
      <p>The Liquorem they have sometimes distilled over, till it has
        become like tears from the eyes. There will however not be much
        of this. </p>
      <p>This they have taken, and from the remaining Faecebus,
        remaining behind, extracted the Pitre, and always distilled off
        their Spirit again from the Pitre, and this so often poured on
        fresh Materiam, till the Spirit has become small; that they
        could have extracted nothing more; then have they extracted all
        the Blood, and so always in the distilling off it remaining,
        which done together is also raised up. Which is nobler than Sol.
      </p>
      <p>This is called the Blood of the Dragon. The remaining Faeces
        have they strongly calcined, and extracted from this a salt,
        which they have clarified, till it has become pure and like a
        Diamond, for one must clean it well. Then they have rubbed this
        Salt small, and put the Blood of the Ancients thereon, and
        melted such in a vessel of Acures together gently, so has the
        Salt become blood red, and the red and white Flowers they have
        prepared again. This they have associated in a vessel for a
        short time, and got a penetrating Tincture therefrom, also they
        have taken of the red Flower, or of the Red Lion 2 parts, of the
        Gluten or Columba Dianae 1 part, rubbed such amongst each other,
        put in a vessel of good burnt Earth, and with Acures covered.
        Such have they added a lid to it, that nothing can fall in, and
        place the vessel, that in preparing the Fire, that it is heated
        gradually, and heat it for 4 hours, so the red flower took the
        white into itself, and this repeated till the 7th time. </p>
      <p>This is that, which the Ancients said, how they finished their
        stone in four hours. They have taken of such one part and added
        to four parts of Ophiris Sol in flux, so it will become pure
        tincture; of which they have incorporated half of this with one
        part of Columba Dianae, as has been taught till the seventh
        time, and in such a manner increased their work in infinitum,
        whereby they supported themselves in their need and came to the
        help of their poor imprisoned brethren </p>
      <p>For Jesses son, David; 1st Chron. Chap. 23, V. 14; has learned
        it by preserving the secret arcane of his forefathers, and
        Moses miracles. And how could David assist the necessitous, if
        he knew no way to help himself? </p>
      <p>Yes David, before he could prepare Sol and Luna, he got bread
        for himself, for he was not sure. </p>
      <p>Of Solomon it is said in Kings 3, Chap. 10. that he made as
        much Sol and Luna as there are stones. It stands that it is
        true, that he had it brought in ships from Ophir, where however
        did David get it hither? And why has Roboams son been obliged
        after his death to live in such poverty? Was he not able to send
        ships to Ophir, in order to fetch Sol? </p>
      <p>Certainly this King, because he wanted Wisdom, that comes from
        the Lord, would not have been able to fill his covetousness. But
        Ophiris Sol is something quite different. Therefore have also
        many of our fathers, who were in need and care, found such noble
        treasures that they would help themselves anew. For when they
        were with God, so was that also with them, as his chosen people.
      </p>
      <p>That he has however denied us his blessing, which is caused by
        us and our fathers sins, which he avenges unto the 1000th
        generation. Therefore call and cry that he may hear us, and
        convert by repentance. That we follow his voice, and depart from
        the unrighteous ways. Did we walk in his precepts, then would we
        also receive prosperity and be glad in God. </p>

      <p>Dear brethren, Ah! That you might understand me, what I at
        present draw before you! For I speak even with you, as with
        children, not in dark words. Get learning and then set out to do
        the work, that your poor brethren might be relieved from
        anxiety. Think yet how their minds are troubled under their
        oppression, that they cannot once raise their heads on high for
        distress; therefore my heart breaks, to show you a way, to help
        you and them. Can you not work, then pray to the Lord, that he
        will give you wisdom: Daniel Ch. 5, V. 21 and 22. It is forsooth
        easy and insignificant, if you only loosen yourself from all
        expensive things in the world. </p>
      <p>Therefore dear Brethren, have I here drawn you a figure, where
        you may have two ways before your eyes. </p>
      <p>First you see, how the Old Albaon chops off with his sword the
        intractable Winged feet of the Phytoni, and that the Phyton has
        in his hands a staff, the meaning of this is, that when such has
        happened, he then has a two-fold nature, which the two serpents
        point out. </p>
      <p>This Old Procreator is drawn out once from the Primordialis
        Chaos, that is signified from the Fire appearing Dragon. But
        however the Old One floats in the Air, denoted the Spiritus
        Universalem or Phyton, the beginning of all things, as I, dear
        brethren, have taught you in the beginning. The Old One however
        has a Scythe or reaping hook, and will cut off the feet of the
        Phyton, which is an indication that such also can be prepared
        from another Materia than out of the Albaon, which is a black
        grey and heavy Materia, and one can get in abundance. And that
        the Old One floats in the Air has the meaning, that from this
        Old One, as I taught you before you shall prepare the Columba
        Dianae, and such blend with the Phytone, and once more cause it
        to rise, and then you get a two-fold Phyton, or the right
        Gluten, the fiery Dragon in the wet way. </p>
      <p>But there is prepared from the Green Lion a crawling Dragon,
        and you have it before your eyes, and can compare with the Old
        One the wet way, and the Dragons the dry way. </p>
      <p>In the work you go one, beyond, in the dry way in the
        preparatory work, there is another Modus than in the Wet. Dear
        brethren, that I may show you, however, that the Ancients
        possessed more secrets, for they are not all united in their
        ideas. </p>
      <p>Those who had not the understanding, that they could fabricate
        the Lapis Albaohest or the Phyton of the Ancients, yet have they
        known the Materiam, and have been in a position to go to work on
        such. </p>
      <p>They have seen that the Alatron could be extracted from the
        Excrements of animals, so did they come on the thought that in
        Man, the most eminent production; in and out of which such
        excrement was frequently to be got. They have therefore
        collected from healthy males their Urine, and let such stand in
        casks to putrefy. Then have they prepared through many
        distillations a volatile Spirit Phytonis, as well in a dry form
        as also a Liquor in an horrible fiery form and Property
        therefrom. </p>
      <p>This they have well preserved, and kept it in an Alingel, then
        they have here conveyed and have prepared from the Noble Wine
        their Heaven and Spiritus Phytonis. </p>
      <p>These two fiery Dragons they have poured together, and again
        driven over, till the most of which ascended into a white
        Gluten; which they have put into an Alingel, and raised, then
        they have taken of the Kalii and of the Salt Earth equal parts,
        and out of both have driven with strong Fire, out of a crooked
        vessel a strong Water, or have from these two stuffs taken only
        one such mixed with an Earth, and with strong Fire prepared one
        Water therefrom. </p>
      <p>This they have driven over several times, that no moisture was
        there. Then have they put the above volatile salty Liquor 1 part
        into a pot, as here depicted (Figure 18). </p>

      <p>Such covered with a head with a long beak, place in a mild
        steamy heat or B.M. placed in Water, then they have prepared the
        others from the Vitriol and Nitre; and also by degrees poured 1
        part thereto, then have these two fiery Dragons bit each other
        powerfully, and fought, till they at least remained lying dead.
        Then they have put a vessel with a spoon to the beak, and have
        driven a Phytonis spirit thereover. When the half also had flown
        over, they then have taken off the Vessel, the remainder they
        have thrown away, the Spirit which flew up, they rectified once,
        and have gotten a mysterious Liquor, with which they have gone
        to work. Others have taken the above fiery salty Liquor, of
        which 1 part, and added of Water Gaza the half, then driven it
        over, and have also successfully proceeded, and have then also
        got the Spirit Phytonis, as a key to the Art, then have they
        taken our Matter, it is Bismuth or Cobalt, and beat it small,
        put it into a vessel; Of this secret Liquor poured thereon, to
        the height of 2 diagonal hands over the matter, and place this
        in a mild heat, continued till the Liquor is coloured grass
        green, the tinged Liquor is poured off, and fresh liquor is
        poured on, so have they got a grass green Liquor and again a
        green Solution; these tinged Liquors they have put together into
        a vessel, and driven it over to the half, the remainder have
        they put in a cool place, so have the stones crystallized, as
        Samaragdine. </p>
      <p>These they have taken out, the Liquor again drawn off to the
        half. Placed the vessel in a cool place, then are yet more
        crystals crystallized. </p>
      <p>Then have they made this secret Salt dry, and placed in a
        crooked vessel, and laid this in an Oven, that the Fire should
        beat around it, and then drive out with strong Fire a volatile
        Spirit with an Oil, so has the Spirit gone over in a horrible
        Wind. For that reason they have luted a great ball in front of
        the crooked necked vessel; the ball have they taken away, and
        there remained behind for them an Alinnegra; then they have
        poured the Liquor back upon the matter, and replaced the ball,
        and driven over the Liquor again; and this they have repeated 9
        or 10 times. </p>
      <p>Then they have taken off the ball with the Liquor, and
        separated into 2 parts, and purified it well, then they have
        obtained a white and high yellow Spirit; with the white they
        have washed the Alingel, and poured the white Spirit thereon,
        and well mixed them together, placed in a mild heat, and then
        the Spiritus Phytonis becomes a blood red colour; this they have
        poured off, and poured on the above mentioned high yellow
        Liquor; and the other on the Latonem, and so long washed, till
        all redness has been drawn out of it; and that which remained
        behind was beautiful white, this they have well preserved. They
        have poured together all the red Liquor, and the white Spirit in
        a high vessel was driven off, till a thick blood came over. This
        they have put aside, and then they have caused yet more to fly,
        from the flown over Bird, that all watery moisture was separated
        therefrom. </p>
      <p>Then have they calcined the remaining Earth. And with the
        Phlegma drawn out a Salt, which they purified, and then they
        rubbed therein the Blood of the Ancients (which is more precious
        than Ophiris Sol) placed into a crooked necked vessel, and
        poured the flying Bird thereon, and then distilled and
        cohobated. </p>
      <p>Then have they called such a Liquor their Chaos. This have they
        put into an Acures well secured. The remaining white Earth have
        they taken, whereof they in the beginning extracted the white
        Salt, and rubbed it small, and put it into a vessel of Acures
        (Figure 19). </p>

      <p>And weighted the same, and added to it 2 parts of the above
        Liquor, and then put the vessel in a mild heat, and distilled
        over the Liquor, and this they have cohobated soften, until it
        remains lying with the Earth and is fixed. Then they have poured
        thereon fresh liquor, and so continued, till all the earth with
        the Liquor has flown up, and then fixed in the Fire and remained
        lying. </p>
      <p>Then have they taken the half of this and melted with equal
        weight of Ophiris Sol, so have they gotten a clear Tincture. </p>
      <p>Then are such carried off, as I taught you before, already dear
        brethren, because all the after work is one and the same. </p>
      <p>But as you see the preliminary works, as you see, are
        different. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, there have been some of the Ancients who worked
        thus; they have taken this green Lion, and shut it up in an
        Alingel, i.e., a long necked vessel, and put in horse-dung, or
        otherwise in a mild vaporous heat, that it should be resolved.
        Then have they gone to work with it, as dear brethren, I taught
        you in the preceding, taken from the Ancients description of
        the Work. They have in the work, proceeded with this wonderful
        Salt, as the wise did with the Green Lion, so they prepared it
        from the Old One. </p>
      <p>For in the wet way, you should also know that with the prepared
        Liquor they attacked the Phytoni; because they had not all the
        knowledge of this our marvelous Materie, and also they have
        taken the Phyton, and put it into a high vessel, and poured
        thereon of the flying serpent, and put a head onto the vessel,
        placed the vessel in sand, and so has the flying dragon eaten
        the creeping reptile, and disintegrated it. Then have they
        driven it over, because it has remained from them a useless
        Earth, this flying Bird they have then poured on a fresh Phyton,
        and again driven them over together, so have they got a secret
        dissolving Water, of great effect. This have they let mount yet
        per se in a well secured vessel, that all remaining watery
        moisture should be separated, and so get its strength, fiery and
        clear, as a tear from the eye. With this Liquor have they also
        been able to do wonders, and have given it divers names. </p>
      <p>With such Liquor have they also gone to work: They have taken
        Ophiris Sol, and beat it into thin leaves, and put it into an
        Alingel and poured so much of the Water thereon, as they thought
        to be enough. </p>
      <p>Then have they placed this in a mild heat, so has this fiery
        Spirit consumed the Sol, and disintegrated it into Blood. </p>
      <p>There has the King lain in is Blood, and his limbs sunk to the
        bottom. Then have they poured off this Red Liquor, and from
        their Spiritual Liquor of Columba Dianae poured yet more thereon
        till the Blood was decocted. Then have they poured such into a
        high glass (Figure 20). </p>

          <b>Figure 20</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Then they put a head thereon, and Lente distilled over the
        flying reptile, till it became a dry Liquor. This they have put
        in an Alingel well secured, some have put this Liquor into a
        crooked Vessel, thus (Figure 21): </p>

      <p>And put it into an Oven in sand, and distill this over and
        Cohobate it, and so have they got the true Oil of Sol and so
        have they received a great Mysterium. This red fiery Lion have
        they divided into two portions, the one half they have put into
        a high Alingel, and such hermetically closed, and put the
        Alingel into an Oven (Figure 22); in which they could give
        Alingel Fire, and let it stand, till it was fixed and firm. Then
        they took it out, and poured of the other portion, 1 portion
        thereon, and closed the vessel again, and put again into the
        oven, and let it stand until it was again firm. Then they took
        it out, and poured the remainder thereon, and this they
        continued till the remainder was all firm and together, so they
        found a fiery firm Oil. </p>
      <p>Then they caused to flow 4 shekels of Ophiris Sol, and poured 1
        shekel heavy of this Oil thereon, and thus charged the Oil and
        the Sol into a Red Tincture, like a Burnt Blood in appearance. </p>
      <p>Of this they took a single grain of this Tincture to 16 shekels
        heavy of other metals, and so they got the most beautiful Sol. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, others who from God the Lord endowed with more
        wisdom, took their Phyton which now had wings, and shut it up in
        the Sol; the Solution they poured off, for their Columba Dianae
        was nothing strange to the Sol, and then weighted it, and of
        together 8 shekels heavy, so they placed thereto also the common
        Phyton, which must be however pure. This they put into an
        Alingel well closed in the Oven in a mild heat; in the beginning
        it was black and a true Chaos, and went at last through all the
        colours. Others, who saw yet a nearer way, poured the Columba
        Dianae on pure Luna, and dissolved it in such. This heavy Water
        they lifted up. Then they took Ophiris Sol, and dissolved it
        also in one part of this Liqour, and poured it off, also into a
        clean vessel; then they took of the Gluten or of the Columba
        Dianae 1 portion, and poured it into an Alingel, and also poured
        the Blood of the king 1 portion, and closed the vessel, and
        placed it into an Oven in mild heat, and let it stand so long,
        till it became black. Then they continued the Algir Fire till
        all had coagulated together, then they took it out, and rubbed
        it small, and put it again into an Alingel and poured of the
        Columba Dianae 1 portion, and also of the Blood of the King 1
        portion thereto, and closed the vessel, and put it again down
        and let it go through the colours, and this they repeated 7
        times. Then they took this Stone out of the vessel, and let 16
        shekels heavy of Ophiris Sol flow, and added 4 shekels of this
        fiery Lion thereto, and so have they got a Tincture. </p>
      <p>Of such they have only thrown some grains on a whole tit of
        other metals, so have they got the most beautiful Sol. </p>
      <p>Afterwards now the dear Ancients did in such a way, help
        themselves many time sin need, as also their brethren, but how
        would they have wished t remain in such need, if the highest had
        not helped? </p>
      <p>Therefore, dear brethren, have I disclosed unto you anew a
        great secret, that you might find a consolation for one cannot
        have everywhere, what one desires in time of need. That it may
        not fail you in your grief and misery, till the deliverance
        comes according t the words of the Lord. </p>
      <p><i>Deni, Adonai, Bocitto, Ochysche</i> in quick time. Persevere
        and guard yourselves that you do not unite with the heathen. </p>
      <p>Be not disconsolate without Elias and Our King, to collect
        again the heathen to you, to destroy them, as some of our
        brethren did, with whom need made them bad, that of them often
        1000 have fallen in one day as by Barchoceta. This one thought
        because he also understood this Science, how one should prepare
        the Mysterium, and to the people to prepare a dreadful poisonous
        Water, thus, you must take Pirtre Kaly Pyton Puvon Salt Earth,
        out of this he taught the people to make a poisonous Water, and
        they made by Cohobating such a horrible fume of poison thereby.
        This they poured into Springs, and it was thick, dark and muddy
        in the heaven. They poured the same into a vessel, they put the
        same in profusion to the Fire, so it began to smoke, and
        poisoned also the Air, that men and beasts perished, than there
        came such a frightful illness among the people. That they got
        dreadful burning blisters, which then began to putrefy and to
        stink, many became pitch black, and fell suddenly down. If it
        came into a house, the poison raged so strongly, that no escape
        was at hand. Guard yourself, I say yet again, guard yourself
        from the like, that you do not make the burden heavier among
        you. Would you walk in the commandment of you God, so will he
        guard you, and send a speedy deliverance. Rely upon Him who made
        heaven, and earth. Hope and wait in patience. </p>
      <p>Guard yourself from errors. Remain faithful then your work will
        soon get its regard. Help comes out of Zion. Psalms 53. </p>

      <p>Dear Brethren, our father Jacob served 7 years for Rachel, and
        it was very toilsome for him; and his reward was changed for all
        that, considering that instead of Rachel he got Leah. </p>
      <p>This is even truly a prototype of your servitude. </p>
      <p>The Lord, the Holy One however will soon conduct us home, when
        the other seven years of affliction are past. </p>
      <p>We must suffer with Leah the weeks of affliction yet a short
        time, then will Rachel be brought to us. </p>
      <p>Consider that Ephraim is the first born of Rachel and not
        Judah. Therefore are we forsaken, and the Lord calls Jeremiah,
        V. 30:20. O Ephraim, my only son how my hear breaks for thee
        that I must again have compassion on thee, and deliver thee and
        lead thee out from Hagar and her son. </p>
      <p>Brethren, the time is soon at an end, that Hagar will drop her
        son for sadness. For the holy Adonai will thrust her out from
        our inheritance, and she will languish from heat, and not be
        able to see, that her son dies from sadness, till the Angel will
        come of the Chosen People, to comfort her a little; yes the Lord
        will not destroy all the heathen, but preserve a portion for the
        service of his people. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, to give you yet a consolation till then, and to
        cheer you, have I again drawn a figure in order to impress on
        you right deeply the secrets. You see an Old hollow Oak-tree
        standing in a garden around which is twisted a rose bush with
        red roses, which has gilt leaves. Underneath from the stem of
        the tree runs a Lunar white Water. </p>
      <p>There are some who not far from this have hoed and digged, but
        found nothing; except those who by the way, who contemplated the
        weight. Dear brethren the old tree is our black and heavy rocky
        lumps of our Albaon. </p>
      <p>You must strike this rock, till it gives Water, as you have
        already previously with all circumstances been instructed and
        taught. For the Lunar white Water, which flows underneath from
        the tree, is our Phyton Columba Dianae, which is heavy. That
        however the tree bears red rose with gilt leaves, such signified
        the Blood of the Old One, which must be drawn out of such
        visibly, as the Blood of the Lion, or our secret. </p>
      <p>That it however flows underneath out of the tree signifies a
        Lunar white Water, which should be prepared from the root of
        such a thing, so that in all parts of its nature it shall be Kin
        to the Sol and Luna, and that it may be also easily made firm
        and stable. </p>
      <p>If you should lose all writings, then you should only depict
        those Figures, or draw such for you children, so will they, as
        others who are of a good understanding. Easily understand such,
        for one dares only to speak with few words, what concerns the
        Mysteria, come to the help of it. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, in order that I however suppress nothing which
        could serve for your advantage, so mark what wonders the
        Ancients have accomplished, when they have taken the Phytonis or
        our Gluten Aquilae, that you might yet better understand, our
        Columbam Dianae, and with such have also gone to work. </p>
      <p>They have taken this as it ascended from the Old One; and have
        caused it to fly over the mountain, i.e., over the Alembic, for
        7 times, so has it become brilliant, but in thus doing it the
        Basilis Kischer way (Figure 23). </p>

      <p>Then they have prepared an acrid water, as you well know, and
        is well known already to you from the foregoing; in such have
        they dissolved Luna, and taken such a Solution, beat again with
        Nitre Water, and well sweetened. Of such have they rubbed 1
        portion among 2 portions of the Columba Dianae, and then put on
        the fire, but before they were placed with each other in a tall
        vessel, therein in a most tolerable Fire the Luna also ascended;
        this they have done among the remainder, and again the Bird
        (Figure 24) caused to fly, and that to the third time; so has it
        appeared with a great brilliance, and has also tolerably lost
        its poison. </p>

      <p>The remainder in the crooked necked vessel have they have taken
        out, or put into another, namely, what remained in the Luna, and
        raised it up (Figure 25). </p>

      <p>The Columba Dianae however from the head put thereto, and thus
        with each other metamorphosed into a heavy glittering Water. Had
        they however poured this Water several times on the remaining
        Lunar earth, and thereof caused it to fly, so would they have it
        coagulated into a White Stone. For this serpent or three-headed
        bird loses at last its wings, and will remain firm, such has
        happened to me, dear brethren. </p>

      <p>This glittering stone metamorphoses the Venus into good Luna, 3
        to 14 grains to 16 shekels heavy of Venus in flux, and this
        stone can easily be augmented, as you will have understood in my
        previous writings. This is the Metamorphosed Venus clothed with
        the Luna. </p>
      <p>Also has it happened to me sometimes that I poured the Columba
        Dianae to a Ophiris Sol, brought before to a Dust, and driven it
        with such aloft, in order that this green Bird might rob the
        King of Body and Blood, and raise it also. </p>
      <p>As I diverted myself also, and that such should fly 7 times,
        and so it remained behind, and even incorporated with the Queen,
        for that reason. </p>

      <p>I was constrained in order to see what would here end. But they
        were firm, and their wings quite burnt off and altered itself
        into a brown-red stone, i.e., the King became fixed with the
        Queen, and both became in a short space of time homogeneous. </p>
      <p>This brown red Stone tinged and metamorphosed, yet for all that
        like the above with a few grains some shekels of metals into
        Sol. </p>
      <p>Therefore when you will in a short and little time help
        yourself and your brethren, then let this be said to you, that
        all Metals ex Phytone have their source and beginning. All
        Metals consist of Ex-Phytone, for the mercury is their
        beginning. This sleeping Lion you can with the fixed Dianae
        easily again waken (Figure 28), if you rub only of the Columba
        Dianae 1 portion among 4 portions of the fixed, and put such
        only into a common vessel, then will the fixed one overcome the
        flying, and eat it in a very short time, so that you receive
        here a higher and more penetrating stone and can likewise
        augment as long as you wish (Figure 29). </p>

      <p>Dear Brethren, that you can bring forward no excuse, as if the
        wise Creator did not care for you, so have I from inclination
        and command recorded, and must record, that it might not get
        lost, and thereby you might obtain a consolation. For it is
        easy, certainly not to all men; for many have such a weak
        understanding, that it is impossible to comprehend it. To some
        others however it is only Childs play. What do you suppose
        indeed? Should Moses and also his brother Aaron not understand
        the same? </p>
      <p>Yes! For how could he turn the Golden Calf into ashes? Exodus
        32. </p>
      <p>The Spirit of the Lord was on him, for he even saw before, how
        the holy Adonai created heaven and earth, and from what, and how
        this efficient Spirit yet hovers before his eyes. This
        intelligible Spirit now, which was the life of all things, Moses
        took and consumed by fire the Calf, and made I into powder. Also
        Miriam, Moses sister, because she was leprous, was cleansed by
        the help of this secret. </p>
      <p>And this was to the Ancients in their need the greatest
        consolation. This secret was, it is true, also known to the
        heathen through carelessness, but it has vanished again from
        their hands. Therefore I ask you that you do not slight my
        warning from their hands. Therefore I ask you that you do not
        slight my warning and such, and where and how you can conceal
        it, that it be not lost. </p>
      <p>It is in Roman, but the most is described in the Arabian
        tongue, that it be not read and understood by every one. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, the Ancients have at their sacrifices often had
        no Fire necessary, for such has been lighted at command of the
        most High though the Angel Michael. So have the Ancients also
        had a Water; 1 Kings, Chapter 18; which they poured on the
        sacrifices, then such has taken fire. </p>
      <p>Such Water have also some had in a dry form. Now this is true
        of Elias, when he will come with the messiah, Gods and Davids
        son be found again, for it lies yet concealed at Jerusalem, as I
        said in the beginning. That you may know, however, how this was
        prepared, and can be prepared, now observe. </p>
      <p>You must understand Nature, otherwise, it will be to you
        incomprehensible. </p>
      <p>One finds a Salt, which then burns, it is the Nitre, this must
        be cleansed by means of dissolving and coagulating, it must
        twice be precipitated from a Solution of Spiritus Vini
        Rectified, in order that all incombustible mucus be taken
        therefrom; which in all its parts,, the truest, yes a pure Fire.
        It is prepared from the Earth, and is to be found everywhere. </p>
      <p>It is not the Universal Salt of the Earth, but it is quite
        another; yet it has much in common with the same; the most of it
        is found in the earth, where animals as sheep, etc., have their
        standing place. From such a Salt have they driven out with great
        care a fiery red Spirit, this they have poured on Pyrtre, which
        is pure and clear, and so long cohobated and distilled, by means
        of a crooked necked vessel, till the Pyrtre has become a Water
        with it (Figure 30). </p>

      <p>This they have poured again on such a fresh Salt, and so it has
        become a thick liquor. This they have once driven over, and
        again poured it back, so that it has become a thick Liquor. When
        this stands in the cold, it will coagulate. Of this they have
        taken 1 portion, and put thereto 1 portion of Naptha, in a
        vessel of burnt stone, for it grows very hot, and&nbsp; so it is
        prepared, and on everything that it is poured on, is eaten and
        consumed by fire, for no Water can exterminate it. </p>
      <p>For that reason take care, that nothing of this preparation
        comes in contact with yourself, for it consumes flesh and bone.
        Should however some of this touch you, then take only Earth
        mixed with Salt, and moisten this, that it becomes like a jelly
        and apply this, so out will be putout, otherwise nothing in the
        World can extinguish this. The Naptha however is an Oil, such as
        flows from the Rocks, and is thick, when it comes to the Air. </p>
      <p>Also you have now information that your children can or may
        find it. What however concerns the said Oil, will be found at
        the time, when the Lord collects us again in our Land. For our
        fathers, priests and Levites have for such a time of need
        prepared. For no sanctuary, so we also require no holy
        consecrated Oil, for the finery is taken from Israel. Yet that
        you might know, what this Oil is for, and whereof it is
        prepared, so mark; </p>
      <p>The Ancients took a vessel of Acures or a vessel of stone,
        covered with Acures, and placed this on a Fire of coal which did
        not scorch or give flames, and put 32 shekels heavy of god Olive
        Oil therein, when this became hot, then they have on hand
        tender, bruised and rubbed Myrrh, Cinnamon, Calamus, Cassia, of
        each 8 shekels heavy, this they stirred amongst each other, and
        let it stand well muffled up, that the strength may remain
        together for 1/4 of an hour. </p>
      <p>And then they took this from the Fire and allowed it to cool,
        and then squeezed the Balsam through a new virgin cloth and
        preserved it in a clean vessel. </p>
      <p>Herewith were the Kings and Priests anointed. </p>
      <p>Guard yourself however, that none understand how to make this
        ointment; he must be a Priest or from a priestly caste. Exodus
        30. God the Lord has forbidden it, so none dare to fabricate
        this holy ointment Oil of the bridegroom, but only a priest, who
        used it at marriages, when two betrothed persons appeared to the
        Priest, so was the bridegroom anointed with this Oil together
        with the blessing of Jacob. </p>
      <p>All our brethren have also received the anointing that their
        matrimonial state may be blessed, and they become fruitful, for
        we are all children of the Holy One. </p>
      <p>This ointment Oil was prepared out of 32 shekels of Olive Oil,
        12 shekels heavy Myrrh, of Aloe and Cassia, 8 shekels heavy,
        Exodus 20. This then the Priests preserved also in a pure and
        holy place. With this they anointed also the sick and blessed
        them, so they became often better or died. Were they not
        anointed before death, then the Priest, after death anointed
        them as well on forehead as on breast. Dear brethren, out of
        what the perfume consisted, you shall also know. </p>
      <p>The ancients have also put it together. They have taken Stacte,
        Onycha, Galbanum and Frankincense amalgam and such also
        preserved. Exodus 30. </p>
      <p>With this have the priests in the Holy of Holies strongly been
        obliged to incense. </p>
      <p>This is now what belonged to the Priesthood, that they could
        show such to their children. What however concerns the Urim of
        the High Priest Exodus 28; in which the great Jehovah showed
        himself, and through such at certain times spoke with the
        people, has not been lost, as one says, but it lies with the
        whole priestly finery preserved as I have previously announced
        to you, and will at the time, when the Lord again will visit his
        people, be brought out by Elias. </p>
      <p>How my soul rejoices when I think thereon, that at that time
        all will be renewed and there will be no more injustice. Israel
        will rejoice, that the 2300 days are over from evening till
        morning, Daniel 8. </p>
      <p>Be comforted, and abide in patience, and it will to you be
        richly rewarded. </p>

      <p>Dear brethren, my heart will burst, when I see your distress.
        Shall they rage and then ruin without cessation, and the sword
        devour the mother with the children? Shall then innocence count
        for nothing? That you even forget us. </p>
      <p>Lord, will thy anger not become tired to destroy? Is it
        possible that the Covenant of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob shall be
        no more? </p>
      <p>Our fathers have acted unwittingly, and have disappeared,
        because they smote the shepherd, Zechariah, Chapter 13. </p>
      <p>Our fathers misdeeds are certainly great, and we are also not
        without sin! They have persecuted the righteous and killed them,
        who showed thy great name. </p>
      <p>They have passed, and have with other gods made idolatry. If
        you sent them a Seer, so would he be destroyed by them, as if
        they were such as agitated the people. Therewith they laid their
        hands on the Holy Ones, and those who were sent by Thee. This
        blood cries to Thee from the earth for revenge. But Israel, thou
        art struck with blindness till the Champion comes, and will
        again put thee into thy inheritance. How willingly, dear
        brethren, would I help you in your need, that is known to the
        Lord, therefore can I not forbear to discover to you yet
        something more. I have again here depicted a Figure, and how can
        I otherwise, that you may yet see. </p>
      <p>You see a flower with 7 leaves, which flower is red and Sol,
        the leaves however not Sol, which are blown by the North Wind.
        The leaves signify our Green Lion, which is far better than
        Ophiris Sol. The Flowers however signify our Red Fixed Lion, the
        Tincture, which no north wind can move. And that it stands on
        the mountain, has a two-fold meaning. Firstly, it is sought by
        many men, but found by few. For this Mountain is our Altar, our
        Materie, which is watched by nothing but griffins and dragons,
        i.e., they are poisonous in their first preparation, therefore
        they are feared, since yet their poison is pure tincture. </p>
      <p>Secondly, that such Flower is born in&nbsp; Air signifies that
        it mounts on the mountains, i.e., into the Alembic. </p>
      <p>That is the Columba Dianae and is at first all there is found
        and seen. That however many griffins watch the mountain, and
        fiery dragons, has a two-fold meaning. </p>
      <p>The fiery dragons are the Phyton or unveiled Dianae (Figure 31)
      </p>

      <p>That nobody knows here, as well in the wet as the dry way. So
        can also with the help of the Universal Chaos of the Ancients,
        like from the Salt Aerum of the Magnetic fatness of the Air this
        fiery Dragon be understood, with which the Ancients did wonders,
        and this they have learned from Moses. </p>
      <p>The Griffins are, as previously mentioned, nothing other than
        Spirtus Phytonis, which can be prepared as well from the old
        Albaon, as also from the Chaos Universali; from men and Vines
        (Figure 32). </p>

      <p>With which they mixed some Mineral spirits and from such they
        prepared a volatile Spirit, with which they burnt off the wings
        of the Phyton, and have metamorphosed into a viscous Water. Now
        however, dear brethren, shall I show yet some secrets worthy of
        wonder from our inexhaustible spring of the Ancients, and yet
        more Mysteria. When you, as you previously understood, your
        Phyton, or Flower have cleansed by many ascendings, so have you
        put this among prepared Luna, or transported into, and have also
        with each other let fly once, so has it become fat and
        glutinous. </p>
      <p>This you have prepared, and when you have prepared it, you will
        likewise see its form. This mercurial Flower will appear, like
        the most beautiful pearls. Will you prepared large pearls, then
        take only small ones, and make such to an inconceivable dust,
        and take of Columba Dianae, so much thereof, that it becomes
        like a pap, somewhat thick, and has Sol or Luna forms, how great
        you would have these, made into such pearls, and stick though
        each a strong bristle, which is clean. The bristles stick to a
        cross piece of wood, this put into a vessel, which you can well
        close; and place it in a mild heat (Figure 33) so they will
        become in a short time as hard, as they have been, and of great
        brilliancy. Take these out and steep them into the Liquor
        prepared from the Columba Dianae, and let them be wiped clean,
        then put them again into a glass, and in a mild heat, the others
        in a short time will surpass. You can also cause forms to be
        made with divers figures, as birds, lambkins, pears, apples and
        the like, besides that, you can prepare pearls of priceless
        value. </p>

      <p>For one is not everywhere in the position Sol and Luna to
        expose to sight, for the enemies sake, because if they became
        conscious of it, they would torment us badly. For consolation in
        your misfortune have I disclosed this. </p>
      <p>One can carry such a pearl himself, and conceal and yet be of
        great value. The Ancients have yet further looked about in
        nature. If they had precious stones, which had not got their
        mature and right colour so have they quickly known, such to
        bring to sight. If they have had a Diamond, which was large and
        not pure, they have cleansed it from all dirt, and put it into a
        vessel, and poured thereupon the Columba Dianae, and let them
        stand with each other in a mild heat, and then has it received
        its pureness and beauty. Others have, however, taken the Columba
        Dianae in dry form, rubbed gently, and put such into a vessel of
        good burnt Earth (Figure 34) and laid in the Diamond, and put
        thereto so much of the Columba Dianae that it is only covered.
        The vessel they have well closed, and then put it into the Fire,
        and let it stand some time, then have they opened the vessel,
        and found their Diamond surrounded with a skin. This they have
        separated from it, then they have found it larger and prettier.
        Yes they have taken only one right beautiful Crystal, and with
        such in this manner proceeded, this they have now performed in
        all secrecy. </p>
      <p>Others have Taken Rubys, because one can have these in
        considerable size, and have gone such a way, and have prepared
        Diamonds thereout of, which shone like a lightning flash. </p>
      <p>They have therefore no alone in such a way maintained their
        life, but have also come to the help of their poor brethren, for
        this have they easily concealed. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, how often have you with such things by
        permission of the great King of the World appeased your enemies,
        that they have become compassionate, and have discharged you
        from servitude. But we must complain. We are everywhere obliged
        to serve, our inheritance lies in waste, and has become a potion
        to the impure, our houses to the enemies, our mothers are widows
        and we are dispersed orphans with fathers. Ah! Our fathers have
        done wrong, and merited such with their sins, we must bear the
        misdeeds from child to childs child. But Lord! What have these
        sheep done to Thee; these miserable ones? Hear yet the cry, and
        the sob of the same. O pity us, that we also lie with our
        fathers in the same condemnation, for the crown of our head is
        gone. But thou great King of the World, who remainest eternally,
        send yet our salvation and our Deliverer, who will lead us out.
      </p>
      <p>Dear brethren be not tired to cry and to call till the Champion
        comes, who will deliver Israel. For his heart will break, that
        he may come to the help of the troubled, and to the mournful for
        joy, to the hungry for good, and to the thirsty for drink will
        be. Be not impatient, that you may make no more of mistakes to
        the Lord, and it again may happen to you like to the fathers in
        the wilderness, and die among the heathen. Fear the name of the
        Lord, then will rise up the Sun of Righteousness. </p>

      <p>Dear brethren, that it may not fail you in the instruction, so
        I will her in conclusion, will not hold back from you the
        remaining secrets of the Ancients, but will reveal these,
        wherewith you may be able to come to the help of the
        necessitous. I have again drawn a Figure, which comprehends much
        in itself. Give heed to it well. </p>
      <p>You see, that a King stands in the Figure with a naked sword;
        his soldiers are killing innocent children, and they collect the
        blood in a well standing thereby, which this is already filled
        with blood, in order to colour it yet some more. Into which
        descends Sol and Luna, to bathe themselves therein. This Figure
        has a two-fold meaning This Figure has a two-fold meaning, as
        well in the wet and dry way. </p>
      <p>That the King stands, and has a sword in his hand, means, that
        one shall kill the King with it, which means nothing else but
        one shall take Ophiris Sol, and with such a double edged sword,
        with the double Central Fire, burn up and disintegrate, where I
        have shown you also, two ways, such to get it over. </p>
      <p>The first is prepared out of the Universal Chaos, the other
        from the Animal, Vegetable and Mineral. Particularly must you
        conform to my teaching, where I showed, how the Ancients
        therewith went to work. They have taken this fiery flying
        Spirit, and poured this on the Phyton, and so has it taken away
        from it the metallic nature, and has become a glutinous white
        water. With this have they further proceeded, and this Liquor
        they again poured on fresh Phyton, so has it also become a thick
        viscous water. Then have they taken the King, and dissolved it
        therein, then has it become red like to Blood. This Blood have
        they now also called the Red Lion, this have they fixed, and as
        I already taught you, augmented their work with this sloppy
        Phyton, and also found a blessed ending. </p>
      <p>Others have prepared these two Fires in their volatile form,
        and taken and dissolved the King with this, and distilled
        therefrom the flying Bird partly, to a red Liquor. This they
        have preserved, and put tone side, then have they also dissolved
        of the Diana, so have they got a blue-green water; of such have
        they likewise from the Liquor drawn the flying Bird in a mild
        heat, whereof they could not kinder, that this Spirit, as well
        from the King, as whose spouse should not have carried and taken
        something away. </p>
      <p>On this account have they poured this flying Bird with solar
        and lunar feathers on the Phyton, so has it again dissolved
        itself again in such. They have they poured off the clear
        Solution, and put again on a fresh Phyton, so have they got a
        fat and heavy Liquor, then have they the King and Queen allied
        with each other, and poured together. Of such have they put the
        half into an Alingel, and as heavy as these two weighed, poured
        thereon of their fatty heavy Liquor. Then in such is the
        beginning and efficacious and have and also herewith sealed
        hermetically their springs, with each other well closed, and on
        our oven allowed to go through the colours, till such had become
        firm. Then have they taken it out, and rubbed small, again
        thereon poured of the Blood of the King and Queen one portion,
        as also of this Cadmi one portion, and however with each other
        let it become fixt. This have they repeated, till the Blood of
        the King all had been consumed. </p>
      <p>Then have they taken out their Tincture, and divided it into to
        two portions, the one they have caused to flow with equal parts
        of Ophiris Sol, and so it has become a pure Tincture. Then have
        they again divided this Tincture into two portions, the one
        portion have they kept themselves for sustenance of their life,
        the other have they however blended with the half of the
        unmelted Tincture, and rubbed amongst each other, this again put
        into an Alingel, moistened with the Gluten Aquillae, that it had
        not only become rather thickish, closed the Alingel well, and
        this again let it go through the colours for Fixation and this
        have they practiced in Infinitum. </p>
      <p>That should you know however, that this Tincture cannot be
        brought so high, as that described in the foregoing, which took
        its origin from the old Albaon, or otherwise prepared from a
        volatile solar material or Metallic Seed; for the Well in this
        Figure from which the blood red water gushes, signifies our
        Blood of the Old Albaon, which pure volatile Tincture is, in
        which Sol and Luna bathe themselves, or in which they grow young
        again. </p>
      <p>This Figure also signifies the inexhaustible augmentation of
        our great work, and is nothing other than our three beginning
        parts whereof our single Materia take their origin, with and
        through which is All in All, as well under as above the earth
        were born all Minerals and Metals, which Materia called by its
        right name, also the analysis clearly taught. Will you on this
        account, in all truth remember this much thereof. </p>
      <p>Our old one according to appearance is like a lead ore, but in
        its parts is a pure volatile Sol and Luna; it dissolves almost
        all its Corpus into a Water by Vitriol and Nitre prepared, which
        is a wonder that Vitriol can be metamorphosed; one finds also
        often that our Old One has white poisonous bones, which is a
        pure poisonous Phyton or Seed, and is here a token, that Nature
        seeks to make this once again volatile, for in such a form it
        can become no Metal; for when this comes into the open Fire, it
        flies all away, and leaves scarcely a little Solar Luna behind.
      </p>
      <p>Do not be terrified before this poisonous reptile, for this Old
        One lies invariable and lives, yet it is a living Materia, which
        breathes and exhales without ceasing it smells through a whole
        room, and when our Old One is triturated and brought into the
        smallest molecule, annexed to such and is put together into a
        vessel, then this poisonous serpent coalesces again; so indeed,
        that if it is often driven from one vessel to another, and
        coalesces so, that one can with no mallet can often bring from
        one another; and that this is such a metallic Phyton or&nbsp;
        pure Seed, is shown by its high dark blue color, which with help
        of white sand or Quartz, or when it is mixed with powder, from
        the stones (as David employed it, from the brook with which he
        killed Goliath) so it gives in a strong fire a heavenly dark
        blue Acures, that also its Tincture and Strength shows itself in
        all places. </p>
      <p>When this material is not yet too old in the mountain pits is
        met with, then it appears as a Luna with red intermixed, and is
        called a volatile Lunar ore. </p>
      <p>If this Mineral is older and has stood longer, then it has all
        the colours of the world, as Lunar white with violet or blue,
        red with golden little sparks intermixed, often quite pure. </p>
      <p>The third species is, when this in the pits begins to become
        white, then the colours are partly lost, and the material
        becomes silver grey mixed with much white. There is in this a
        most poisonous and pure volatile Tincture, which is well to bear
        in mind, and all three are of one species and from one root,
        only that one possesses more Tincture, than the other, yet are
        all three precious in the Art, and this material is a right
        Hermaphrodite, i.e., of masculine and feminine seed. The other
        Materia is also not to be thrown away, for it is almost in all
        its parts a pure volatile Sol seed, looks usually like pure Sol,
        is found also in red and yellow Marcz, in black and yellow
        grains, also in grey and white sand mixed with black grains,
        From such may it also be dissolved with a Liquor, and brought
        into Crystals of strange properties. </p>
      <p>I have also pointed out, what the Materia is, which is denoted
        by so may strange Names and Figures for it is everywhere easy to
        get. All other Tinctures as I have shown and described to you,
        from other Materia are only helpers in need, and take away often
        more times than when you had the correct Materiam; if however
        one can not have this, while one is not qualified in all places,
        so will I on that account yet further show you, when you have no
        Sol or Luna, as from the base Metals a Tincture prepare, be
        means of the above named double fiery spirits. Others however
        who had no Sol or Luna at the beginning took their volatile Fire
        and mars, and made it tenderly into Dust, and poured thereon the
        Liquor, and placed the Vessel in a mild heat, and so it
        dissolved the Mars into a high green colour. </p>
      <p>This Solution they poured off, and poured fresh thereon; this
        they continued till all was extracted, the like they did also
        with Venus, then they poured these two together into a very tall
        vessel, and allowed to fly a little more than half of this
        Spirit to distill over. </p>
      <p>The remainder they placed in a cool place, so they gathered
        Crystals as Sapphires and Turquoises. </p>
      <p>These they took out, the remainder, which was yet joined to no
        Salt, they took, and allowed the bird to fly over again to the
        half, and placed the remainder again down, then added the
        remaining Salt afterwards. </p>
      <p>Here they had a marvelous Salt, so in its interior a pure
        Blood, and Tincture, for the above fiery Water takes only the
        spiritual body of the Venus and Mars. </p>
      <p>The fiery Spirit which was drawn over from the Venus and mars,
        they took, and poured it on the Phyton, and so dissolved it in
        such. </p>
      <p>The solution they brought also into a tall vessel, and
        distilled the fiery Humidity therefrom; for the Phyton does not
        ascend easily, so they met with such a heavy mucilaginous and
        viscous Water, and this they preserved well. </p>
      <p>Then they took their marvelous Nitre, and rubbed it small. Here
        they were not united in the work, for so brought it into a
        crooked necked vessel (Figure 35), and drove from this a Spirit
        and red Oil with force of the fire. They cohobated the Spirit
        with the Oil from the remaining red Earth so often, till the
        most part of it had flown over. </p>

        <p><b>Figure 35</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>From the remaining Earth they extracted with the laid up
        Humidity, so they distilled off from the Phyton a white Salt,
        this they also brought into their Liquor. </p>
      <p>These three now they put in a mild heat, that they should unite
        with each other. Then they distilled such with each other, with
        a strong Fire and Cohobando from a strong vessel, they got a
        Liquor of marvelous effect. </p>
      <p>Of this they took one portion and of the Liquor in which the
        Phyton had joined, also one portion, these two they poured
        together, and distilled them afterwards with a strong Fire
        Cohobando. </p>
      <p>They took this Liquor and divided it into 4 portions, the one
        portion they brought into an Alingel, and shut it well, and let
        them together go through the colours. Others however, who were
        more knowing, took the Earth, from which the Nitre remained
        behind, and heated it thoroughly, and it is well true, and
        brought it into such a vessel, which was tall, because such was
        of a virginal essence, and poured on the Liquor, when the Earth
        weighed one shekel, they poured 7shekels heavy of the Liquor
        thereon, and put the vessel only in an oven in sand and began to
        distill, and distilled what would go over. The over ascended
        they cohobated, till it all remained firm behind. Then they
        poured on fresh Liquor 1 portion thereof, and continued such,
        till it would no more be coagulated, but flew into the vessel
        together, fixed and constant in the Fire. </p>
      <p>Of this Liquor now carried over, they poured 1 portion to 16
        portions of Venus in flux, and got the most beautiful Sol. </p>
      <p>Then they took of this Sol 4 portions, and let it flow, and
        threw 1 portion of their Tincture thereon, then it became pure
        Tincture. </p>
      <p>This they parted into 2 portions, and put the one portion again
        in, and worked immediately, and were helped in their need. </p>
      <p>Others, however who were more sage, took this marvelous Salt,
        and brought such into a vessel, closed it and put it into a mild
        heat or in horse-dung, in order that it resolve itself into a
        grass green Liquor, which they likewise gave may marvelous
        names. This they now took, and brought it into a crooked necked
        vessel of Acures, and separated this Liquor from each other, and
        put it again together, as I have already taught you. This now of
        a simple conception was made with great trouble from this salty
        Liquor, as mentioned previously, with a strong Fire, which alone
        they made firm, and had no knowledge of the Phyton, how it has a
        co-agent, as Sol and Luna must be in doing this, that they also
        its seed gave thereto. </p>
      <p>When now that they carried their Tincture to the Venus so it
        indeed became also a Tincture, when however they carried this to
        other Metals, before they carried it to the Venus, as that
        previously happened to a Sol containing Venus. Here they knew
        not how to help themselves, and if they carried this Tincture to
        the Phyton, so it would not take it in, for it was yet in its
        combustible bodies, therefore they must be satisfied with what
        they had, that their work was not once satisfied. </p>
      <p>Dear brethren, Nature is most hidden, yet she can give no more,
        than she herself has in her power. Others now who had no Sol or
        Luna in readiness, yet from a mighty understanding when they
        prepared their double fiery spirit, they preserved such, and
        made, as I taught you already in the beginning, a solar Spirit
        in pure Water, and let such again therefrom fume, this they have
        repeated several times, then they poured a Spirit prepared from
        the Vino thereon, and extracted all solar Tincture thereout. </p>
      <p>This Spirit they now distilled again, till there remained a red
        Dust, on this Dust they now poured their fiery Water, and
        extracted it several times, then they got an auriferous Phyton,
        then they made with the fiery Water also from the Phyton a
        glutinous Liquor, and poured these two together, and made this
        according to the Art firm; then they got an Oil Tincture on
        Venus in Sol. </p>
      <p>Others however made a Salt from the Mars and Venus as is taught
        and from this with force of the fire drove an Oil Liquor and
        poured these 3 in similar weight together. The Earth Virgineam
        so remaining, they calcined with strong Fire and commenced to
        carry their Tincture thereon, as is already said, and so they
        got a Tincture much stronger than the former, and could also
        easily increase this. </p>
      <p>Therefore can you see, dear brethren, when you wish to, that
        the All Wise King of the World has shown enough ways, to help
        you in your need. That however I keep nothing back, what can
        serve only to your well being, so have some of the Ancients also
        gone in the following way, for they not always would have been
        able to attain their purpose, and have yet understood and known
        the true Mineral Materia. </p>
      <p>So have they taken such, and beat small, and with this Menstruo
        or fiery Water dissolved its body, and prepared from the same a
        marvelous Salt, and have come much closer to Nature. </p>
      <p>With such a Green Lion have they gone to work, according to the
        above teaching, and have also obtained their purpose. </p>
      <p>Others who knew not how to help themselves, and who wanted
        wisdom only merely with this fiery Water unfolded Ophiris Sol
        into a blood red Tincture, and again mildly distilled such a
        fiery Water therefrom, till a red Dust remained. </p>
      <p>This Dust they have carried to other Sol standing in a red
        flux, and tinged such Sol with it, and transmigrated it to a
        brittle red Massa, with which they have brought some portions of
        Luna into Sol. I could, dear brethren, reveal yet more of the
        same secrets, but the life of man is too short, but I have only
        wished to show you the most secret and important ways, but I
        have only wished to show you the most secret and important ways,
        that you might have something for consolation in your
        oppression, in order to free your poor imprisoned brethren from
        the bonds of servitude, and come to the help of poor widows and
        orphans, and to provide for the necessitous and miserable, that
        you through doing will eradicate all evil. </p>
      <p>Give alms willingly, fast and pray, for such eradicates sin and
        releases from death. You will support yourself that you may
        live. Tobit 12. </p>
      <p>Hold this book even concealed, that the curse may not come on
        you, and you be banished from the earth. Act wisely and wait in
        patience. The blessing of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob will come to
        you, and God will fulfill the promise of Abraham. </p>
      <p>The Lord will keep his covenant, and he has sworn. Come all,
        you chosen ones to praise the Lord, the King of all the World.
        You servants of God praise the Lord for his gifts, and praise
        the eternal Saviour, who lives for ever. </p>
      <p>Praise with me and all that is by us, praise the Lord! </p>
      <p>Praised be He, who releases His people, and raises from the
        dust. </p>
      <p>May His Kingdom remain to Eternity. </p>
      <p>Halleluja, Hossanna, Halleluja. </p>
