      <p>Frank Pringle, CEO of Global Resource Corp., has developed an
        emissions-free process that uses microwaves to pull fuel out of
        shale rock, tires and even plastic bottles. The extraction
        technology might also help recover oil that is stuck in muck
        inside hundreds of capped wells across the country. </p>

      <p>Global Resource Corp announced today that performance tests to
        convert bituminous coal into kerosene without using any
        additives. The process was invented in 1923 but has never been
        completed without additives and a required heat source, which is
        now replaced by GBRC's patent-pending microwave technology. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>Global Resource Corp's HAWK recycler extracts oil and gas in
        seconds from most everyday objects like tires, plastic cups, as
        well as from shale, coal, and tar sands. Microwaves tuned to an
        optimum frequency separate the component parts which can be
        burned or condensed into liquid fuel, using only a small portion
        of the energy produced. </p>
      <p>GRC’s Patent Pending discoveries encompass many years of
        research and development working in high frequencies of
        microwave (RF) identifying specific frequencies most suitable
        for the target substance. The microwave frequences are applied
        in linear acceleration with molecular excitation of polar
        molecules intrinsic to hydrocarbons and other carbon materials.
        The process can also be used for extracting heavy oil from
        capped-off oil wells. </p>
      <p>The first commercial plant is under construction. Available
        Production unit expected in early 2008. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><b>Description:</b> </p>
      <p>"To everything there is a frequency that excites its molecules
        best. Just like the 2450MHz frequency magnetron in your kitchen
        microwave oven which is specific to water (H2O) molecules, GRC’s
        hydrocarbon specific frequencies are generated by much higher RF
        klystrons that actually crack the hydrocarbon chain into its
        characteristic fuels. </p>
      <p>"By definition it is not pyrolysis because cracking the
        hydrocarbon chain is inherent to specific frequencies and has
        little to do with the amount of heat generated. The process
        however is done without water and performed in an oxygen starved
        environment. We call this technology: <b>High-Frequency
          Attenuating Wave Kinetics</b> or HAWK for short. </p>
      <p>"There is also no CO2 or CO produced in the process because
        there is no oxidation other than possibly a miniscule amount
        that may be pre-existing in the material or minerals processed.
        GRC’s vacuum environment creates an accelerated pressure thereby
        assimilating what Mother Nature has done through countless years
        to make fuels. </p>
      <p>"The two basic elements offered for all GRC’s applications are
        in situ and off situ. We have designed klystron machinery for
        gasifying hydrocarbons where they exist or in fabricated
        systems. In-situ meaning processed deep in the ground, rock
        formations or anywhere naturally occurring and off-situ meaning
        processed above ground that is mined or material removed from
        site. </p>
      <p>"A klystron is a microwave electron tube with velocity
        modulation that is different from magnetrons. Its uses were
        privy to military applications for radar jamming before stealth
        technologies became more dominant in later years. GRC is the
        first to commercialize this technology and by modifying
        amplifiers and power supplies to suit our applications, we now
        possess the technology that will free America from foreign oil
        imports." </p>

      <p>Mr. Frank Pringle began work identifying Specific Microwave
        Frequencies in 1996 while working to separate ceramics from bulk
        glass cullet systems. Since the, and mainly over the past seven
        years, Mr. Pringle has identified over 1200 specific RF
        microwave frequencies intrinsic to hydrocarbon
        elements/materials. <br>

        new technologies to the petrochemical industries where we offer
        many proprietary solutions in Enhanced Oil &amp; Energy Recovery
        Processes." </p>
      <p>"Global Resource Corp. has a patent pending process that allows
        for removal of oil and alternative petroleum products at very
        low cost from various resources, including shale deposits, tar
        sands, waste oil streams and bituminous coal with significantly
        greater yields and lower costs than are available utilizing
        existing known technologies. The process uses specific
        frequencies of microwave radiation to extract oils and
        alternative petroleum products from secondary raw materials, and
        is expected to dramatically reduce the cost for oil and gas
        recovery from a variety of unconventional hydrocarbon resources.
        GBRC's technology will not only be developed to extract oil from
        shale, but from depleted oil fields in the US and elsewhere,
        many of which still contain more than half of the hydrocarbons
        originally in these fields, because the residual hydrocarbons
        are too viscous to extract with conventional technology." </p>

      <p><b>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional
        Patent Application No. 60/750,098, "Method for Using Microwave
        Radiation", filed Dec. 14, 2005, the entirety of which is
        incorporated by reference herein. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0002] The present invention relates to methods and apparatuses
        for using microwave radiation and more particularly, to methods
        and apparatuses for decomposing compositions comprising
        petroleum-based materials. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] Petroleum-based materials are integral to the world's
        economy and demand for such fuels and consumer products is
        increasing. As the demand rises, there is a need to efficiently
        and economically extract petroleum-based materials to fulfill
        that demand. As such, it would be advantageous to not only be
        able to extract petroleum-based materials from the earth, but to
        also recycle consumer products to recapture those
        petroleum-based materials. </p>
      <p>[0004] Worldwide oil consumption is estimated at seventy-three
        million barrels per day and growing. Thus, there is a need for
        sufficient oil supplies. Tar sands, oil sands, oil shales, oil
        cuttings, and slurry oil contain large quantities of oil,
        however, extraction of oil from these materials is costly and
        time-consuming and generally does not yield sufficient
        quantities of usable oil. </p>
      <p>[0005] Soil contaminated with petroleum products is an
        environmental hazard, yet decontamination of petroleum-tainted
        soil is time-consuming and expensive. </p>
      <p>[0006] Furthermore, it has been estimated that 280 million
        gallons of oil-based products such as plastics go into landfills
        each day in the United States. It would be desirable to
        recapture and recycle the raw materials of these products. </p>
      <p>[0007] Scrap vehicle tires are a significant problem worldwide
        and their disposal presents significant environmental and safety
        hazards, including fires, overflowing landfills, and atmospheric
        pollution. While there are a number of existing applications for
        these tires, including tire-derived fuels, road construction,
        and rubber products, these applications are insufficient to
        dispose of all the available scrap tires. The major components
        of tires are steel, carbon black, and hydrocarbon gases and
        oils, which are commercially desirable. As such, it is
        advantageous to develop processes for the recovery of these
        products from scrap vehicles tires. Prior art methods of
        decomposing scrap vehicle tires do not produce commercial-grade
        carbon black and require high temperatures and extended exposure
        times for recovery of the hydrocarbon components. </p>
      <p>[0008] Efforts to recycle tires using microwave technology has
        been described in <b>U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,507,927</b> and <b>5,877,395</b>
        to Emery. Efforts to recover petroleum from
        petroleum-impregnated media has been described in <b>U.S. Pat.
          Nos. 4,817,711</b> and <b>4,912,971</b> to Jeambey. Efforts
        to decompose plastics using microwave radiation has been
        described in <b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,084,140 </b>to Holland. The
        prior work has involved the use of single-frequency microwave
        radiation. Single-frequency microwave radiation is a slow
        process that does not provide uniform heating. Moreover,
        single-frequency microwave radiation typically results in arcing
        on metal components. </p>
      <p>[0009] Thus, there is a need for methods and apparatuses for
        the recycling of petroleum-based compositions and for the
        recovery of petroleum-based materials from composites containing
        petroleum-based materials. The invention is directed to these
        and other important needs. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0010] The present invention provides methods for decomposing
        compositions comprising carbon-based materials comprising
        subjecting the compositions to microwave radiation for a time
        sufficient to at least partially decompose the composition,
        wherein the microwave radiation comprises at least one frequency
        component in the range of from about 4 GHz to about 18 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0011] The present invention provides methods for decomposing
        compositions comprising petroleum-based materials comprising
        subjecting the compositions to microwave radiation for a time
        sufficient to at least partially decompose the composition,
        wherein the microwave radiation comprises at least one frequency
        component in the range of from about 4 GHz to about 18 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0012] The present invention further provides methods for
        recovery of petroleum-based materials from composites comprising
        those petroleum-based materials. The methods of the present
        invention include subjecting the composite to microwave
        radiation for a time sufficient to extract the petroleum-based
        material, wherein the microwave radiation comprises at least one
        frequency component in the range of from about <b>4 GHz to
          about 18 GHz</b>. </p>
      <p>[0013] The present invention also provides for products
        produced by the methods of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0014] The present invention additionally provides apparatuses
        for decomposing compositions comprising petroleum-based
        materials. The apparatuses of the present invention comprise a
        microwave radiation generator, wherein the generator is capable
        of applying microwave radiation characterized as having at least
        one frequency component in the range of from 4 GHz to about 18
        GHz, and at least one container to collect decomposed components
        from the compositions. The present invention further provides
        apparatuses for extracting petroleum-based materials from
        composites comprising the petroleum-based material. These
        apparatuses comprise a microwave radiation generator, wherein
        the generator is capable of applying microwave radiation
        characterized as having at least one frequency component in the
        range of from 4 GHz to about 18 GHz, and at least one container
        to collect decomposed components from the composite. </p>

      <p>[0049] 1 Torr=1 mm Hg=1 millimeter mercury. </p>
      <p>[0050] Methods for decomposing compositions comprising
        petroleum-based materials are set forth herein. The compositions
        used in the present invention contemplate any composition
        comprised of petroleum-based, carbon-based and various
        hydrocarbon materials. The petroleum-based materials may be
        present in the composition in amounts ranging from about 1% to
        100%, by weight, based on the weight of the composition.
        Preferably, the composition is a vehicle tire. In other
        embodiments, the composition comprises plastic, which includes,
        but is not limited to ethylene (co)polymer, propylene
        (co)polymer, styrene (co)polymer, butadiene (co)polymer,
        polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polycarbonate,
        polyethylene terephthalate, (meth)acrylic (co)polymer, or a
        mixture thereof. A variety of natural and synthetic resins and
        rubbers can also be decomposed according to the methods
        described herein. Various carbon-based materials that can also
        be processed according to the inventions described herein
        include coal, such as anthracite coal and bituminous coal. </p>
      <p>[0051] In one embodiment, the composition is subjected to
        microwave radiation for a time sufficient to at least partially
        decompose the composition. The microwave radiation can be in the
        range of from about 4.0 and about 12.0 GHz. Other ranges can
        also be used, for example, in the range of from about 4 GHz to
        about 18 GHz, and more preferably in the range of from about 12
        GHz to about 18 GHz. For example, coal can be processed at
        frequencies in the range of from about 4 GHz to about 18 GHz,
        and more preferably in the range of from about 12 GHz to about
        18 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0052] In one embodiment, the composition is subjected to one
        or more pre-selected microwave radiation frequencies.
        Preferably, the pre-selected microwave radiation frequency will
        be the resonating microwave frequency, i.e, the microwave
        radiation frequency at which the composition absorbs a maximum
        amount of microwave radiation. It has been determined that
        different compositions of the present invention will absorb more
        or less microwave radiation, depending on the frequency of the
        microwave radiation applied. It has also been determined that
        the frequency at which maximum microwave radiation is absorbed
        differs by composition. By using methods known in the art, a
        composition of the present invention can be subjected to
        different frequencies of microwave radiation and the relative
        amounts of microwave radiation absorbed can be determined.
        Preferably, the microwave radiation selected is the frequency
        that comparatively results in the greatest amount of microwave
        radiation absorption. In one embodiment, microwave radiation
        frequency resulting in a comparative maximum absorption of
        microwave radiation by the compositions of the present invention
        is in the range of from about 4.0 and about 12.0 GHz. In others,
        particularly with respect to vehicle tires, the microwave
        radiation frequency resulting in a comparative maximum
        absorption of microwave radiation by the compositions of the
        present invention is in the range of from about 4.0 and about
        7.2 GHz. In yet others, the microwave radiation frequency
        resulting in a comparative maximum absorption of microwave
        radiation by the compositions of the present invention is in the
        range of from about 4.0 and about 6.0 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0053] The present invention also provides methods for
        subjecting a composition to a sweeping range of microwave
        radiation frequencies for a time sufficient to at least
        partially decompose the composition. Preferably, variable
        frequency microwave ("VFM") is used to sweep the compositions.
        VFM is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,321,222 to Bible, et al. and
        U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,360 to Johnson, et al., incorporated herein
        by reference in their entireties. Unlike single frequency
        microwave radiation, VFM produces a bandwidth of microwave
        radiation frequencies that are applied sequentially to the
        composition. Consequentially, the field distribution with VFM is
        substantially more uniform than the field distribution of single
        microwave frequency radiation. The more uniform field
        distribution of VFM produces fewer hot spots, resulting in more
        uniform heating of the composition. Moreover, generally, no
        single frequency is applied for longer than about 25 .mu.s. The
        short duration of each applied frequency produces no build-up of
        charge, thus eliminating discharge, or arcing, typically
        observed during single frequency microwave irradiation. </p>
      <p>[0054] In some embodiments, particularly with respect to
        vehicle tires, the range of microwave radiation frequencies
        swept is in the range of from about 4.0 GHz to about 12.0 GHz.
        In certain embodiments, the range of microwave radiation
        frequencies swept is in the range of from about <b>5.8 GHz to
          about 7.0 GHz</b>. In still others, the range of microwave
        radiation frequencies swept is in the range of from about <b>7.9





          GHz and 8.7 GHz</b>. In some embodiments, range of microwave
        radiation frequencies is in the C-Band frequency range, the
        C-Band frequency range encompassing microwave frequencies in the
        range of from about 4.0 GHz to about 8.0 GHz. In other
        embodiments, the range of microwave radiation frequencies is in
        the X-Band frequency range, the X-band frequency range
        encompassing microwave frequencies in the range of from about
        8.0 GHz to about 12.0 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0055] Preferably, the sweeping of the range of microwave
        radiation frequencies encompasses a pre-selected, resonating
        microwave radiation frequency characterized as having at least
        one frequency component in the range of from about 4.0 GHz to
        about 12.0 GHz. This frequency can be selected by using the
        methods described herein and techniques known in the art.
        Preferably, the bandwidth of the sweeping range of microwave
        radiation is about 4.0 GHz. More preferably, the range of
        microwave frequencies with which the composition is swept, is
        about .+-.2 GHz of the pre-selected microwave radiation
        frequency. For example, if the pre-selected microwave radiation
        frequency is 7.2 GHz, the composition would be swept with the
        range of microwave radiation frequencies encompassing from about
        5.2 to about 9.2 GHz. The microwave frequencies can also be
        swept at about .+-.1.5 GHz, or even .+-.1.0 GHz, or even .+-.0.5
        GHz of the preselected microwave frequency. </p>
      <p>[0056] Upon decomposition of the compositions subjected to the
        methods and apparatuses of the invention, flammable
        hydrocarbon-based gases are released. To reduce the risk of
        ignition, it is preferred that the method be performed in an
        oxygen-deprived atmosphere. Preferably, the composition is
        exposed to less than about 12% oxygen. More preferably, the
        composition is exposed to less than about 8% oxygen. Even more
        preferably, the composition is exposed to less than about 5%
        oxygen. </p>
      <p>[0057] In one embodiment, the composition is exposed an inert
        gas atmosphere. Preferably, the inert gas is nitrogen, argon, or
        mixtures thereof. </p>
      <p>[0058] In some embodiments, the composition is exposed to less
        than atmospheric pressure. Preferably, the composition is
        exposed to less than about 40 Torr. More preferably, the
        composition is exposed to less than about 20 Torr. Even more
        preferably, the composition is exposed to less than about 5
        Torr. Without being bound by any particular theory or operation,
        it is believed that operating at sub-atmospheric pressures helps
        to recover hydrocarbon-based gases and prevents over-heating. </p>
      <p>[0059] In one embodiment, the composition of the present
        invention forms a vehicle tire. Using the methods of the present
        invention, the tire can be decomposed to produce at least one of
        oil, gas, steel, sulfur, and carbon black. </p>
      <p>[0060] Over-exposure to microwave radiation and over-heating of
        the composition of the present invention may result in the
        recovery of non-commercially-acceptable carbon black.
        Controlling the temperature of the composition during microwave
        irradiation prevents such over-exposure and over-heating to
        produce commercially-acceptable carbon black. Preferably, the
        temperature of the composition does not exceed about 700.degree.
        F. More preferably, the temperature of the composition does not
        exceed about 500.degree. F. Even more preferably, the
        temperature of the composition does not exceed about 465.degree.
        F. </p>
      <p>[0061] In one embodiment, the temperature of the composition
        can be controlled while performing the method of the present
        invention by pulsing the microwave radiation subjection. For
        example, microwave radiation can be applied until the
        composition temperature reaches about 465.degree. F., at which
        time, the application of microwave radiation can be stopped for
        a time sufficient for the composition to cool between about 5 to
        25 degrees. Once the composition has cooled, the application of
        microwave radiation can be resumed. This process can be
        repeated, as necessary, until the composition is sufficiently
        decomposed. </p>
      <p>[0062] Decomposition products obtained from the compositions
        using the methods of the present invention may be refined and/or
        purified using techniques known in the art. </p>
      <p>[0063] The present invention also provides methods for
        extracting petroleum-based materials from composites comprising
        the petroleum-based materials by subjecting the composites to
        microwave radiation for a time sufficient to extract the
        petroleum-based material. Preferably, the microwave radiation is
        in the range of from about 4.0 and about 12.0 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0064] The composites are any material comprising
        petroleum-based materials, including, but not limited to, at
        least one of oil sands, oil shale, slurry oil, oil cuttings, and
        soil or sand contaminated with petroleum-based materials. As
        used herein, "composites" also includes, but is not limited to,
        oil wells. </p>
      <p>[0065] In one embodiment, the composite is subjected to one or
        more pre-selected microwave radiation frequencies. Preferably,
        the pre-selected microwave radiation frequency will be the
        resonating microwave frequency, i.e, the microwave radiation
        frequency at which the composite absorbs a maximum amount of
        microwave radiation. It has been determined that different
        composites of the present invention will absorb more or less
        microwave radiation, depending on the frequency of the microwave
        radiation applied. It has also been determined that the
        frequency at which maximum microwave radiation is absorbed
        differs by composite. By using methods known in the art, a
        composite of the present invention can be subjected to different
        frequencies of microwave radiation and the relative amounts of
        microwave radiation absorbed can be determined. Preferably, the
        microwave radiation selected is the frequency that comparatively
        results in the greatest amount of microwave radiation
        absorption. In one embodiment, microwave radiation frequency
        resulting in a comparative maximum absorption of microwave
        radiation by the composite of the present invention is in the
        range of from about 4.0 and about 12.0 GHz. In others, the
        microwave radiation frequency resulting in a comparative maximum
        absorption of microwave radiation by the composite of the
        present invention is in the range of from about 7.9 and about
        12.0 GHz. In yet others, the microwave radiation frequency
        resulting in a comparative maximum absorption of microwave
        radiation by the composite of the present invention is in the
        range of from about 7.9 and about 8.7 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0066] The present invention also provides methods for recovery
        of petroleum-based materials from composites comprising those
        petroleum-based materials, by subjecting the composite to a
        sweeping range of microwave radiation frequencies for a time
        sufficient to extract the petroleum-based material, and wherein
        the range of frequencies of the microwave radiation is in the
        range of from about 4.0 GHz to about 12.0 GHz. The composites
        are any material comprising petroleum-based materials,
        including, but not limited to, at least one of oil sands, oil
        shale, slurry oil, oil cuttings and soil or sand contaminated
        with petroleum-based materials. </p>
      <p>[0067] Preferably, variable frequency microwave ("VFM") is used
        to sweep the composites. VFM is described in <b>U.S. Pat. No.
          5,321,222</b> to Bible, et al. and <b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,521,360</b>
        to Johnson, et al., incorporated herein by reference in their
        entireties. Unlike single frequency microwave radiation, VFM
        produces a bandwidth of microwave radiation frequencies that are
        applied sequentially to the composite. Consequentially, the
        field distribution with VFM is substantially more uniform than
        the field distribution of single microwave frequency radiation.
        The more uniform field distribution of VFM produces fewer hot
        spots, resulting in more uniform heating of the composite.
        Moreover, generally, no single frequency is applied for longer
        than about 25 .mu.sr, or no longer than about 20 .mu.s, or no
        longer than about 15.mu.s, or even no longer than about 10.mu.s.
        The short duration of each applied frequency produces no
        build-up of charge, thus eliminating discharge, or arcing,
        typically observed during single frequency microwave
        irradiation. </p>
      <p>[0068] In certain embodiments, the range of microwave radiation
        frequencies is in the range of from about 7.9 GHz to about 12.0
        GHz. In still others, the range of microwave radiation
        frequencies is in the range of from about 7.9 GHz and 8.7 GHz.
        In some embodiments, range of microwave radiation frequencies is
        in the C-Band frequency range, the C-Band frequency range
        encompassing microwave frequencies in the range of from about
        4.0 GHz to about 8.0 GHz. In other embodiments, the range of
        microwave radiation frequencies is in the X-Band frequency
        range, the X-band frequency range encompassing microwave
        frequencies in the range of from about 8.0 GHz to about 12.0
        GHz. </p>
      <p>[0069] Preferably, the sweeping of the range of microwave
        radiation frequencies encompasses one or more pre-selected
        microwave radiation frequencies in the range of from about 4.0
        GHz to about 12.0 GHz. This frequency can be selected by using
        the methods described herein and techniques known in the art. In
        one embodiment, the pre-selected microwave radiation frequency
        is in the range of from about 7.9 and about 8.7 GHz. In other
        embodiments, the bandwidth of the sweeping range of microwave
        radiation is about 4.0 GHz. More preferably, the range of
        microwave frequencies with which the composition is swept, is
        about .+-.2 GHz of the pre-selected microwave radiation
        frequency. For example, if the pre-selected microwave radiation
        frequency is 7.2 GHz, the composition would be swept with the
        range of microwave radiation frequencies encompassing from about
        5.2 to about 9.2 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0070] Upon extraction, flammable hydrocarbon-based gases are
        released. To reduce the risk of ignition, it is preferred that
        the method be performed in an oxygen-deprived atmosphere.
        Preferably, the composite is exposed to less than about 12%
        oxygen. More preferably, the composite is exposed to less than
        about 8% oxygen. Even more preferably, the composite is exposed
        to less than about 5% oxygen. </p>
      <p>[0071] In one embodiment, the composite is exposed to an inert
        gas atmosphere. Preferably, the inert gas is nitrogen, argon, or
        mixtures thereof. </p>
      <p>[0072] In some embodiments, the composite is exposed to less
        than atmospheric pressure. Preferably, the composite is exposed
        to less than about 40 Torr. More preferably, the composite is
        exposed to less than about 20 Torr. Even more preferably, the
        composite is exposed to less than about 5 Torr. </p>
      <p>[0073] In one embodiment, the composite is subjected to
        microwave radiation sufficient to heat the petroleum-based
        material to its boiling point temperature. Boiling point
        temperatures of petroleum-based materials are known in the art.
        Reducing the pressure at which the composite is exposed will
        result in a decrease in the boiling point temperature of the
        petroleum-based material. Those of skill in the art will be able
        to determine the boiling point temperatures of petroleum-based
        materials at different pressures. </p>
      <p>[0074] In some embodiments, the methods of the present
        invention may be used in situ to extract petroleum-based
        materials from composites located in the field. In other
        embodiments, inert gases may be flowed, in situ, onto the
        composites. In one embodiment, the pressure surrounding the
        composite may be reduced to below atmospheric pressure. </p>
      <p>[0075] Using the methods of the present invention, oil and/or
        gases can be recovered from the composite. </p>
      <p>[0076] The petroleum-based material extracted using the methods
        of the present invention may be refined and/or purified using
        techniques known in the art. </p>
      <p>[0077] The present invention also provides for apparatuses for
        decomposing a composition comprising a petroleum-based material.
        In one embodiment, the apparatuses of the present invention
        comprise a microwave radiation generator, wherein the generator

        further embodiments, the microwave radiation generator is
        capable of applying sweeping microwave radiation in the range of
        about 5.8 GHz to about 7.0 GHz. In yet other embodiments, the
        microwave radiation generator is capable of applying sweeping
        microwave radiation in the range of about 7.9 GHz to about 8.7
        GHz. </p>
      <p>[0079] In another embodiment, the chamber is open to the
        outside atmospheric conditions. In other embodiments, the
        chamber is closed to the outside atmosphere. In yet other
        embodiments, the chamber has an internal pressure of less than
        atmospheric pressure. Preferably, the chamber is capable of
        operating at a pressure of less than about 40 Torr. More
        preferably, the chamber is capable of operating at a pressure of
        less than about 20 Torr. Even more preferably, the chamber is
        capable of operating a pressure of less than about 5 Torr. </p>
      <p>[0080] The present invention also provides for apparatuses for
        extracting a petroleum-based material from a composite
        comprising the petroleum-based material. In one embodiment, the
        apparatuses of the present invention comprise a microwave
        radiation generator, wherein the generator is capable of
        applying microwave radiation characterized as having at least
        one frequency component in the range of from about 4.0 GHz to
        about 12.0 GHz, and at least one container to collect the
        extracted petroleum-based material. In some embodiments, the
        microwave radiation generator is capable of applying a microwave
        radiation frequency of characterized as having at least one
        frequency component in the range of from about 4.0 and about
        12.0 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0081] In other embodiments, the apparatuses of the present
        invention comprise a microwave radiation generator, wherein the
        generator is capable of applying a sweeping range of frequencies
        of microwave radiation characterized as having at least one
        frequency component in the range of from about 4.0 GHz to about
        12.0 GHz, and at least one container to collect the extracted
        petroleum-based material. In some embodiments, the microwave
        radiation generator is capable of applying sweeping microwave
        radiation in the C-Band frequency range. In yet other
        embodiments, microwave radiation generator is capable of
        applying sweeping microwave radiation in the X-Band frequency
        range. In further embodiments, the microwave radiation generator
        is capable of applying sweeping microwave radiation in the range
        of about 5.8 GHz to about 7.0 GHz. In yet other embodiments, the
        microwave radiation generator is capable of applying sweeping
        microwave radiation in the range of about 7.9 GHz to about 8.7
        GHz. </p>
      <p>[0082] In some embodiments, the apparatuses of the present
        invention may be used in situ to extracted petroleum-based
        materials from composites located in the field. </p>
      <p>[0083] In other embodiments, the apparatuses further comprise
        at least one chamber for holding the composite. In another
        embodiment, the chamber is open to the outside atmospheric
        conditions. In other embodiments, the chamber is closed to the
        outside atmosphere. In yet other embodiments, the chamber has an

        preferably, the chamber is capable of operating at a pressure of
        less than about 5 Torr. </p>
      <p>[0084] In other embodiments, the apparatuses further comprise
        at least one chamber for holding the composition. The volume of
        the compositions of the present invention may reduce during
        decomposition. In some embodiments, the chamber may have a
        conveyor having a perforated bottom such that decomposed
        materials may fall out of the chamber once reaching a particular
        size, so as not to over-expose the materials to microwave
        radiation. The conveyor may be adapted to be oscillated. </p>
      <p>[0085] An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is
        depicted in FIGS. 1A-1G. FIGS. 1A-1G demonstrates one apparatus
        wherein tire fragments are placed on a first conveyor belt that
        carries the tire pieces through three, differently-sized
        chambers of the apparatus. In a first chamber, the tire pieces
        are exposed to microwave radiation using the methods described
        herein. As the tire fragments decompose, the smaller pieces will
        fall through perforations in the first conveyor and drop to a
        second conveyor. The second conveyor is not exposed to microwave
        radiation in the first chamber. The second conveyor carries the
        pieces to a second chamber, wherein they are exposed to
        microwave radiation using the methods described herein. As the
        pieces decompose, the smaller pieces fall through the
        perforations in the second conveyor to a third conveyor. The
        perforations in the second conveyor are smaller than the
        perforations in the first conveyor. The third conveyor is not
        exposed to microwave radiation in the second chamber. The third
        conveyor carries the pieces to a third chamber, wherein they are
        exposed to microwave radiation using the methods described
        herein. As the pieces decompose, the smaller pieces fall through
        the perforations in the third conveyor to a fourth conveyor. The
        perforations in the third conveyor are smaller than the
        perforations in the second conveyor. Decomposition will be
        essentially complete after exposure in the third chamber and the
        material remaining on the fourth conveyor will be mainly steel,
        carbon black, and ash, which can be further processed using
        techniques known in the art. </p>
      <p>[0086] FIG. 1 comprises FIGS. 1A-1F, along with inset FIG. 1G.
        The orientation of FIGS. 1A through FIG. 1F are set forth in the
        inset in FIG. 1. Referring to FIGS. 1A-1G, there is provided an
        embodiment of the present invention directed to processing tire
        cuttings using microwaves to recover fuel oil. The processing
        equipment described herein is commercially available from one or
        more process equipment manufacturing companies. </p>
      <p>[0087] FIG. 1A illustrates an elevation view of the beginning
        section of a tire cuttings plant layout according to an aspect
        of the present invention. This illustration shows two tire
        processing lines side-by-side in a parallel configuration. Tires
        from automobiles and trucks are first cut into suitable chips,
        e.g., 4.times.4 or 5.times.5 chips (not shown). The tire chips
        are transported using incline belt conveyor 120 to accumulation
        silos 102. The tire chips are then conveyed from the
        accumulation silos 102 to a pre-washer screw wash section 122.
        Tire chips are then conveyed to a pressure washer hot water
        sonic washer 105. Dirt, stones, gravel and other debris is
        cleaned off of the tire chips to minimize contamination of the
        process further downstream. The tire chips are then dried using
        forced air dryer system 106. FIG. 1B is a plan view of the
        beginning section of a tire cuttings plant layout corresponding
        to FIG. 1A. Cleaned and dried tire chips are then conveyed up
        another conveyor 120, as set forth in FIGS. 1C and 1D, below. </p>
      <p>[0088] FIG. 1C is an elevation view of the midsection of the
        tire cuttings plant layout described here. Cleaned and dried
        chips are transported to accumulation silo 112, which are then
        transported along transport conveyor 120 to microwave room 124.
        The details of the microwave room 124 or further described in
        FIG. 1G below. In this elevation view, a dual wall tank with
        enclosed high high-capacity heat exchanger 118 is shown in
        dotted lines. This high-capacity heat exchanger receives
        hydrocarbon vapor produced by the microwave reactors residing
        within the microwave room 124. The position of the dual wall
        tank with enclosed high-capacity heat exchanger 118 is
        illustrated further in FIG. 1D. </p>
      <p>[0089] FIG. 1D is a plan view of the midsection of the tire
        cuttings plant layout described here. Accumulation silos 112
        feed tire chips via incline belt conveyor 120 and screw feed
        in-feed section 117 to a series of microwave reactors within
        hermetically sealed reactor room 116 with filtration system and
        vacuum pumps. Tire chips in the screw feed in-feed section 117
        are fed into a first microwave reactor 150 (see FIG. 1G)
        residing within the microwave room 116. The microwave room is
        depicted in FIG. 1D containing two sets of microwave reactors
        side-by-side. Additional microwave reactors and additional lines
        can also be added. Hydrocarbon vapors generated in the microwave
        reactors from the irradiated tire chips are collected out of the
        top of each of the microwave reactors. The hydrocarbon vapors
        are then transported, under vacuum (e.g. at a pressure less than
        ambient) to heat exchanger 118. The heat exchanger is capable of
        further separating hydrocarbon vapors to oil and high carbon
        gases by cooling to a liquid or a vapor, depending on the
        vaporization temperature of the hydrocarbon vapors. </p>
      <p>[0090] The microwave reactor room 116 is also depicted having
        refrigeration equipment 123 for maintaining constant room
        temperature. Processed tire chips exit the microwave reactor 154
        (FIG. 1G) by a screw feed discharge section 115. Processed tire
        chips exit the final microwave room hot and are subsequently
        cooled using cooler 114. The cooled processed tire chips (below
        about 110.degree. F.) then enter a pregrader grinder system 113,
        where processed carbon containing materials are separated from
        metallic materials (e.g., metal tire cords). Metal materials are
        separated using a suitable magnetic conveyor take away system,
        as shown in 121 in FIGS. 1E and 1F. Organic particles (e.g.
        carbon black) can further be shipped to bulk feed trucks
        equipped to handle fine particles, other packaging, as well as
        rail cars. The resulting organic particles are composed
        primarily of carbon. In some embodiments, the organic particles
        can be used as electronic activators, as described herein. </p>
      <p>[0091] FIGS. 1E and 1F illustrate the magnetic conveyor take
        away system 121 for separating metal particles from nonmagnetic
        organic matter. Metal is stored in a metal storage unit 140
        while nonmagnetic organic matter (e.g., carbon particles) is
        transported via incline belt conveyor 120 to silo and grinder
        130. Carbon particles prepared according to the processes of the
        present invention are suitable for use as electron activators
        for the microwave processing of heavy residual refinery oil and
        other materials (e.g., residual oil from the bottom of a
        hydrocarbon distillation apparatus that is traditionally unable
        to be further processed). In one embodiment, the tire sidewalls
        can be separated from the tire treads. Tire treads typically
        have a greater amount of carbon black than the sidewalls.
        Accordingly, the amount of carbon black recovered from the
        treads is greater than that of the sidewalls. In one aspect,
        carbon black can be accumulated to form electron activator by
        processing the treads. Electron activator that can be further
        used in processing heavy viscous oil feedstocks. Also present is
        a sifter system with grinder return 111 for preparing controlled
        particle size carbon material. The matter in the silo and
        grinder 130 is transported by a pneumatic tube conveyor system
        119 and auxiliary pump 136 toward sifter 132, and then to sorter
        134, and finally to a super sack gantry system 138. The super
        sack entry system 109 is suitable for loading and unloading
        using forklift delivery. Also shown is electrical enclosure 108
        containing control panels, a centrifugal feeder/sorter system
        110 for managing fine particles. </p>
      <p>[0092] As shown in FIGS. 1D and 1G, the microwave reactor room
        contains two series of three reactors each (one series is
        illustrated in FIG. 1G). Tire pieces enter first reactor 150 via
        screw feed infeed section 117. This reactor is the largest
        reactor of the series. 4.times.4 or 5.times.5 inch tire chips
        are first exposed to microwaves in the first reactor 150 by
        operation of the microwave antennas in the first microwave
        chamber 160. In this first stage, the tire pieces "pop" or
        explode into smaller pieces when exposed to the microwaves. The
        smaller pieces are separated through a mesh belt 170, and then
        transported onto another transportation mesh belt 172. The mesh
        is designed to keep the microwaves in the first reactor from
        getting through and over heating the tire chips. Typically, the
        temperature of the tire chips is maintained at about 465.degree.
        F. or less. The mesh size in the larger reactor will have an
        opening of approximately 2 inches, the mesh size in the midsized
        reactor is approximately 0.5 inches, and the mesh size opening
        for the smallest reactor is approximately 1/16''. </p>
      <p>[0093] Microwaves are generally generated outside of the
        microwave room and transported into the microwave room by a
        suitable microwave conduit, e.g. stainless steel wire. The
        design and interconnection of the three microwave reactors in
        series is provided so that the location of the tire chips in the
        microwave radiation zone is maintained so that the tire chips do
        not exceed 465.degree. F. Initially, "popping" of the tire
        begins in the first reactor 150 when the temperature of the tire
        chips is in the range of from about 300.degree. F. to about
        450.degree. F. It has been surprisingly found that once the
        temperature exceeds about 450.degree. F., the carbon black
        residing within the tires can be charred and overcooked and the
        efficiency of the process for recovering hydrocarbon fuel oils
        diminishes drastically. Accordingly temperature is desirably
        maintained below about <b>465.degree. F</b>., or even below
        about 550.degree. F. Without being bound by any particular
        theory of operation, it appears that the tire chips pop because
        the reactors are under vacuum and a lot of gas within the tire
        chips is being released suddenly upon irradiation with
        microwaves. </p>
      <p>[0094] Suitable operating pressures are the range of up to
        about 20 mm of mercury, or even up to about 40 mm of mercury, or
        even up to about 100 mm of mercury. Accordingly, tire chips
        processed in the first microwave reactor 150 are then
        transported to the second microwave reactor 152, where the
        processed chips are further irradiated under vacuum using
        microwave antennas 162. The tire chips are further reduced in
        size, and fall through mesh 174, and then transported to the
        third microwave reactor 154. In the third microwave reactor 154,
        the processed chips are further irradiated using microwave
        antenna 164. Processed chips are finally transported by a screw
        feed discharge section 118 and exit the microwave reactors from
        screw feed discharge section 166, and through airlock (not
        shown) and onto conveyor 156. </p>
      <p>[0095] Each of the microwave reactors are fed with microwave
        conduits terminating in a suitable cone or nozzle. The first
        microwave reactor has more microwave nozzles 160 as it is larger
        than the other two microwave reactors. The second microwave
        reactor is shown with microwave nozzles 162, and the third
        microwave reactor is shown with microwave nozzles 164. Each of
        the microwave reactors contains vacuum lines 180 to transport
        the resulting hydrocarbon gases to the high-capacity heat
        exchanger 118 (shown in dotted lines). Also shown in the
        microwave room 124 are refrigeration equipment 123 to maintain
        the temperature of the ambient conditions in the microwave room,
        and support structures 158 for supporting the microwave
        reactors. </p>
      <p>[0096] Suitable microwave ranges for the processing of tire
        chips includes using X-band microwave radiation generators (not
        shown) transmitted via conduit in tubes at various frequencies
        to each of the reactors. Microwave frequencies for tire
        processing varies from X-band down towards C-Band radiation.
        X-band is 5.2 to 10.9 GHz; C-band is 3.9 to 6.2 GHz. K-band
        radiation is also useful in some embodiments. K-band is 10.9 GHz
        to 35 GHz, which includes the sub-bands Ku (15.35 GHz to 17.25
        GHz) and Ka (33.0 GHz to 36.0 GHz). Typically separate microwave
        antenna tubes are separated in frequency by approximately 0.2
        gigahertz. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1G, a total of
        approximately 36 microwave antenna tubes are transported from a
        microwave source (not shown) to the microwave reactors. The
        largest microwave reactor 150 has the greatest number of tubes,
        for example about 18. The second microwave reactor 152 has fewer
        tubes, approximately 12. The third microwave reactor 154 has the
        fewest number of tubes, approximately 60. Each of the tubes are
        capable of operating at different frequencies, which frequencies
        in certain preferred embodiments varies between about 7.0 and
        6.4 GHz. The ends of the microwave antenna from which the
        microwave radiation exits into the reactor chambers are fitted
        with a suitable cone antenna. Each of the cone antennae emits
        microwave radiation at a separate frequency, which is typically
        about 0.2 GHz different than the others that irradiate into each
        of the microwave reactors. Microwaves are typically fixed in
        frequency but they may also be capable of being swept in a
        varying frequency manner, for example, by using a variable
        frequency microwave generator. A number of different frequency
        combinations are envisioned, for example each of the cone
        antennas may be fixed in frequency, vary in frequency, or any
        combination thereof. As the tire chips are irradiated, volatile
        hydrocarbon vapors are emitted from the tire chips and collected
        by vacuum tubing. Hydrocarbon vapors are then transported to a
        heat exchanger condenser. Highly volatile gases and vapors that
        are not conveniently liquefied can be separately recovered as a
        high BTU gas product. </p>
      <p>[0097] The plant layout described in FIGS. 1A-1G is operated at
        a product speed (per line) of approximately 30 tires per minute
        on average. Hourly production rate is approximately 36000 pounds
        per hour or approximately 1300 ft..sup.3 per hour. This is based
        upon a used automobile tire weight of approximately 20 pounds
        (9.1 kg). Or alternatively a used truck tire about 40 pounds
        (18.2 kg). The shredded tire chip sizes can be in the range of
        from about 3 to about 5 inches. Average loose density of the
        chips is approximately 24 pounds per cubic foot to about 33
        pounds per cubic foot. Heat values generated at atmospheric
        pressure range from approximately 12,000 BTUs per pound to about
        15,000 BTUs per pound. </p>
      <p>[0098] FIG. 2A is an elevation view, axial direction, of a
        microwave reactor suitable for processing oil cuttings according
        to an aspect of the present invention. Oil cuttings comprise
        dirt, rock, water, carbon deposits, and the like, which oil
        cuttings are obtained during drilling operations. Drilling
        operations include drilling from an oil rig, drilling from a
        deep-sea oil platform, as well as mining of shale rock and coal
        deposits. During drilling, rock that is rich in hydrocarbons is
        typically reached prior to hitting a pocket of oil. This
        hydrocarbon rich rock is transported up to the surface and can
        comprise up to 15% oil, and even up to 25% oil. The consistency
        can also be similar to oil shale. Hydrocarbon rich rock can be
        considered hazardous waste and would need to be disposed of
        properly. It cannot be sent to a landfill, and accordingly it
        has traditionally been handled by combustion. This is
        particularly a problem on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean,
        where it may be forbidden to dump oil drillings comprising
        greater than 1% hydrocarbon content. Accordingly, the process of
        the present invention can also be used to recover hydrocarbons
        from drill cuttings, thereby permitting the drill cuttings to be
        placed back in the environment after the hydrocarbons have been
        substantially removed. As used herein the term "substantially
        removed" refers to a composition comprising less than 1% by
        weight hydrocarbon content. Oil drill cuttings having less than
        0.01% by weight hydrocarbon has been produced using the
        processes described herein. Accordingly, the methods suitably
        provide drill cuttings that comprise less than 1 percent, or
        even less than 0.5 percent, or even less than 0.2 percent, or
        even less than 0.1 percent, or even less than 0.05 percent, or
        even less than 0.02 percent, or even less than 0.01 percent by
        weight hydrocarbons based on weight oil cuttings. Suitable oil
        cuttings enter into the system through in-feed grinder system
        201. Oil cuttings are ground to a suitable size, then fed into
        the microwave reactor chamber (vacuum sealed reactor tank 216)
        via in feed screw 202. The vacuum sealed reactor tank 216
        contains a helical mixer element 203 for mixing and stirring the
        ground oil cuttings. The reactor tank is typically filled to
        about 40% of its total volume. The microwaves irradiate the
        contents of the reactor via antennas that are oriented in an
        orbital arrangement emanating from the top of the reactor. The
        microwave antennas are desirably flexible and irradiate from
        several slides from the top the reactor towards the mixing
        material below. A helical mixer element is turned using a motor
        210. Microwaves emanating from a cone antenna or a plurality of
        cone antennas (not shown) irradiate the oil cuttings with
        suitable microwave radiation. Hydrocarbon gases and oil vapor
        exit towards the top vacuum tubing towards vacuum pump and
        collected in a suitable heat exchanger vapor condensing unit.
        Hydrocarbon vapor gases produced by the process of irradiating
        the oil cuttings with microwaves exit via a vacuum discharge
        tube (not shown). Residual geologic material and unreacted
        carbon deposits settled towards the bottom of the reactor. The
        unvaporized matter is discharged from the microwave reactor 216
        via screw feed discharge section 204, and exits the system via
        discharge system 206. Material exiting the system is suitably
        clean of hydrocarbons so as to be considered nonhazardous waste.
        For example, material exiting the reactor can be returned to the
        ocean after drilling, or can be returned to the land after
        drilling. Also shown is reactor support structure 205 for
        holding the components as set forth in the system. </p>
      <p>[0099] FIG. 2B illustrates an elevation view of the microwave
        reactor of FIG. 2A, longitudinal direction. Oil cuttings are
        added to the system as in-feed via an airlock at 201, which oil
        cuttings are then transported to the reactor 216 via in-feed
        screw 202. Depicted in this diagram is conduit 214 for pulling
        vacuum on the airlock, and on the vacuum sealed reactor tank
        216, using vacuum pumps 207. Microwave waveguides 212 are shown
        entering the vacuum sealed reactor tank 216. Microwaves
        emanating from a suitable microwave cone antenna radiates the
        oil cuttings within the reactor tank. A helical mixer element
        203 rotates to mix the oil cuttings, convey the oil cuttings,
        and reflects microwaves throughout the volume of the chamber.
        After suitable microwave processing at a particular residence
        time, the reacted oil cuttings exits the reactor through screw
        feed discharge section 204 and exits via a suitable airlock 206
        of the discharge system. Also shown is reactor support structure
        205. </p>
      <p>[0100] FIG. 2C illustrates an elevation view of the microwave
        device and control room suitable for generating microwaves and
        propagating the same through waveguides. The microwave device
        and control room 208 is depicted as comprising an electrical
        panel and a series of six individual microwave generators (222,
        226, 230, 234, 238, and 242) each connected to a series of
        microwave antennas (220, 224, 228, 232, 236, and 240). The
        antennas are combined into a combined antenna conduit 212 which
        exits the microwave device control room 208 and leads towards
        the vacuum sealed reactor tank 216 as shown in FIG. 2B. Suitable
        microwaves for processing oil drill cuttings have frequencies in
        the range of about 11.2 to about 11.8 GHz, typically about 11.5
        GHz. Oil shale can also be processed using the equipment and
        processes described herein at a microwave frequency in the range
        of from about 10.6 to about 11.2 GHz, and typically about 10.9
        GHz. Tar sands can be appropriately processed using microwaves 4
        to about 12 GHz. Tar sands can also be processed in the K-band,
        preferably in the Ku band. Anthracite coal deposits can also be
        processed in the KU band as well. A vacuum is maintained within
        the microwave reactor chamber using suitable vacuum and
        hydrocarbon vapor condensation equipment, for example at
        pressures less than about 100 mm of mercury, and even at
        pressures of less than about 40 mm of mercury, or even at
        pressures of less than about 20 mm of mercury. Maintaining such
        low operating pressures helps to keep the overall process
        temperatures below about 465.degree. F. or even a temperatures
        less than about 450.degree. F. so as to prevent overheating and
        efficient recovery of hydrocarbon vapors. A large proportion of
        the hydrocarbon vapors can be condensed into liquid fuel oil at
        ambient temperatures. </p>
      <p>[0101] The system described in FIGS. 2A-2C can be suitably
        adapted and scaled to process oil cuttings at a throughput of up
        to about 2 tons per hour to even up to about 10 tons per hour.
        It should be readily apparent to the skilled person how to
        increase the size and power of the microwave reactor chamber to
        yield higher throughputs. </p>
      <p>[0102] The system described in FIGS. 2A-2C can also be suitably
        adapted in scale to process oil shale rock. The processing of
        oil shale rock includes irradiating it with suitable microwaves
        at power sufficient to increase the temperature of the oil shale
        rock to within a range of from about 500.degree. C. to about
        600.degree. C. Without being bound by any theory of operation,
        it is believed that these processing temperatures are
        considerably hotter than compared to tire cuttings for the
        reason that more energy needs to be applied to the rocks to
        volatile lies the hydrocarbons. This is in contrast to softer,
        substantially higher concentration hydrocarbon, tires that
        readily absorb the microwave energy. Suitable shale rocks are
        broken down into small pieces after being mined. For example,
        shale rock pieces are suitably smaller than an inch cube, even
        smaller than a half inch cube, or even smaller than about 3/8''
        cube, even smaller than about a half inch cube, or even smaller
        than about 1/4'' cube. The hydrocarbon content of the oil shale
        rock typically comprises hydrocarbons comprising from about C10
        to about C25, or even from about C14 to about C22. Oil shale
        rock can contain up to about 5% by weight hydrocarbons, or even
        up to about 15% by weight hydrocarbons, or even up to about 25%
        by weight hydrocarbons. In some cases, shale rock can contain up
        to about 70% by weight hydrocarbons. </p>
      <p>[0103] FIGS. 3A and 3B depicts several embodiments of the
        present invention for recovering petroleum-based materials and
        hydrocarbons from oil slurry. FIGS. 3A and 3B are schematic
        illustrations of two embodiments of a microwave assisted system
        for the distillation and recovery of heavy oil bottoms, e.g.,
        oil slurry, from a distillation plant. FIG. 3A shows the
        following elements of a traditional hydrocarbon distillation
        plant: 302 distillation tower 360 unrefined inlet into
        distillation tower; 304 vapor line; 306 natural gas line; 308
        gas separator; 310 pump; 312 LPG line; 314 gasoline lines; 316
        jet fuel (kerosene) line; and 318 inset: close-up view of the
        liquid vapor contact caps with an a distillation tower. This
        distillation system can be modified using the microwave process
        of the present invention as follows. An electron activator 320
        is added using an electron activator pump 322 into residual oil
        362. Hot residual oil line (e.g., heavy oil) 362 is pumped into
        the microwave reactor 330 and atomized using an atomizer 334.
        Microwave waveguide antenna 336 is powered from the microwave
        room and control system 340, which control system includes
        microwave generators 342 and microwave waveguides 344. The
        microwaves exit the waveguide antenna 336 at cone nozzles within
        the microwave reactor so as to radiate the atomized residual oil
        above the atomizer 334. Vacuum pumps 350 connected to the vacuum
        line 332 maintains pressure of less than about 20 mmHg, or even
        less than about 40 mmHg, or even less than about 100 mmHg. The
        irradiation of the atomized residual oil gives rise to cracking
        of the residual heavy oil, which in turn produces hydrocarbon
        vapors such as natural gas 352 and heavier hydrocarbon vapors
        such as diesel and heating oil 354. In the microwave reactor
        330, residual oil 362 is removed from the bottom of a
        distillation tower 302, combined with electron activator 320 and
        processed by microwave after atomization. We have discovered
        that addition of the electron activator to the residual oil, for
        example about 2% by weight based on residual oil of carbon small
        particles, gives rise to a much faster, more efficient
        absorption of the microwaves to yield more efficient cracking of
        the residual oil. Accordingly, electron activator made using
        microwave processing of tire chips as described supra is useful
        for making electron activator. Suitable electron activator is
        provided as a fine powder, for example of about a hundred mesh,
        or finer. The electron activator may be coarser than 100 mesh,
        depending on the precise application and handling requirements.
        Without being limited by any particular theory of operation, the
        electron activator enhances the absorption of microwaves by the
        residual oil, which gives rise to faster processing and more
        efficient processing of the heavy oil. As a result, the electron
        activator, which comprises carbon powder particulates, are
        capable of absorbing microwave radiation. Solid particles
        containing residual hydrocarbons, such as electron activator,
        result in popping (as in popcorn) when irradiated. Without being
        bound by any particular theory of operation, it is believed that
        the popping action of the small electron activator particles
        within the residual oil enhances the microwave processing of the
        residual oil. In certain embodiments, the electron activator
        functions as a catalyst for effectuating the microwave cracking
        process. </p>
      <p>[0104] Suitable microwave radiation frequency ranges from about
        8.0 to about 8.8 GHz, or in the range of from about 8.1 GHz to
        about 8.7 GHz, or even in the range of from about 8.2 GHz to
        about 8.6 GHz, or even in the range of from about 8.3 GHz to
        about 8.5 GHz, or even about 8.4 GHz. The microwave reactor
        contains a series of microwave cone antennas that radiate the
        atomized residual oil with microwaves. These microwave cone
        antennas can each receive the same or different microwave
        frequencies. When the frequencies differ, they typically are
        separated by increments of about 0.2 GHz. Ranges of microwave
        frequencies are typically useful for processing the atomized
        residual oil in this manner. Accordingly multiple microwave
        antennas 344 receive microwaves generated by a plurality of
        microwave generators 342 provided in the microwave control
        system 340. Microwaves are transmitted through microwave
        antennas 344 to the microwave antenna conduit 336. Microwaves
        then enters the microwave reactor. Typically the residual oil
        362 is pre-heated to a temperature of about 350.degree. C. so
        that it is capable of flowing under pressure and atomized. The
        use of microwaves has been demonstrated to effectively crack the
        hydrocarbon chains in the heavy residual oil. Atomization helps
        to increase the surface area of the residual oil and decrease
        particle size, thereby effectuating absorption of the microwaves
        and cracking of the hydrocarbon chains. The residual oil is
        suitably heated to temperatures sufficient that can flow under
        pressure and atomized. Suitable temperatures are at least about
        250.degree. C., or even at least about 300.degree. C., or even
        at least about 350.degree. C., or even at least about
        400.degree. C., or even at least about 450.degree. C., or even
        at least about 500.degree. C. The residual oil may be preheated
        using any of a variety of heating methods, for example
        convection, conduction, or irradiation, e.g. microwaves. The
        heavy residual oil chains crack at least several times. </p>
      <p>[0105] Processes according to the present invention are capable
        of producing combustible gases. The processes according to the
        present invention are also capable of producing at least several
        different weights of oils. These oil products range from carbon
        content of hydrocarbon chains comprising from 14 carbons up to
        about 25 carbons. The starting residual oils comprise
        hydrocarbon chains having at least 25 carbons or even at least
        28 carbons. The hydrocarbons in the residual oil do not
        necessarily need to be linear hydrocarbon chains, for example
        cyclic and branched hydrocarbons are also envisioned. Instead of
        atomization, hot flowing residual oil can be formed into a thin
        film and irradiated with microwaves, or can be ejected into a
        shooting stream and irradiated with microwaves, or can be broken
        into droplets under force of pressure and irradiated with
        microwaves. Similar related processes give rise to narrow
        dimension residual oil droplets. In certain embodiments the
        products of microwave radiation within the microwave reactor 330
        illustrated in FIG. 3A can be recycled back to the distillation
        tower 302 for further processing. </p>
      <p>[0106] FIG. 3B is a schematic of another embodiment of a
        microwave assisted distillation and recovery unit for heavy oil
        bottoms from a distillation plant. This embodiment is similar to
        that described in FIG. 3B, with the exception that this
        embodiment further includes a reboiler 348 for heating the
        bottoms coming from distillation tower 302 by a transfer line
        370. The reboiler heats the bottoms which are distilled in
        vacuum tower 340. Residual oil 346 from the vacuum tower is
        combined with electron activator 320 using electron activator
        pump 322 to provide a mixture of residual oil in electron
        activator 362. This mixture is then atomized in microwave
        reactor in 330. The operation of the microwave reactor is
        similar to that discussed supra in FIG. 3A. </p>
      <p>[0107] FIG. 4A illustrates an elevation view of a microwave
        reactor system suitable for processing shale rock, tar sands,
        drill cuttings, and the like. Inlet feed screw 402 is suitable
        for transporting shale rock and other hydrocarbon containing
        cuttings and the like into microwave reaction chamber 412.
        Helical screw mixing flights 408 are mounted to an axle 406
        which is rotated using a motor. Helical screw mixing flights mix
        and transport the material, such as shale rock pieces, in the
        microwave reaction chamber interior 404. Microwave antennas 410
        enter the interior of the microwave reaction chamber 404. The
        material within the microwave reaction chamber interior is
        stirred and irradiated. Vapors are removed using a vacuum
        recovery system and condensing unit (not shown). Material
        depleted of hydrocarbon vapor is discharged through the exit
        discharged from feed system 416. Also shown is a support
        structure 414. </p>
      <p>[0108] FIG. 4B provides a plan view of FIG. 4A, wherein the
        direction of the material is shown entering the microwave
        reaction chamber via onlet feed screw 402 mixing within the
        microwave reaction chamber by a helical screw mixing flights
        408, and finally exiting via exit discharge screw feed system
        416. FIG. 4C is an elevation view of the microwave reactor
        system along the axis 406, the near end being the exit discharge
        screw feed system section 416. FIG. 4D illustrates a suitable
        microwave device control room, waveguides, and vacuum pumps
        suitable for use with the system illustrated in FIG. 4A. FIG. 4E
        illustrates an optional hopper elevator for transporting
        material into the inlet feed section 402. FIGS. 4F and 4G
        illustrate three horizontal microwave reactor systems operating
        in parallel. FIG. 4H illustrates additional microwave
        generators, waveguides and vacuum pumps for operating the three
        horizontal microwave reactors illustrated in FIGS. 4F and 4G.
        The processing of hydrocarbon containing materials, such as
        shale rock, tar sands, drill cuttings and the like, is conducted
        in a vacuum environment, less than about 20 mm of mercury, or
        less than about 40 mm of mercury, or even about less than 100 mm
        of mercury. The hydrocarbon containing materials are subject to
        heating by the microwaves and other heating means, up to about
        350.degree. C., or even up to about 450.degree. C., or even up
        to about 550.degree. C., or even up to about 600.degree. C. The
        hydrocarbon containing materials are removed from the microwave
        reactor chamber via a suitable vacuum plumbing system. The
        hydrocarbons are recovered using a suitable heat exchange or
        condensing system (not shown). </p>
      <p>[0109] FIG. 5A depicts an exemplary embodiment of the present
        invention for extracting petroleum-based materials, carbon-based
        materials and hydrocarbon-based materials in situ. A probe
        capable of generating microwave radiation (e.g., cone, antennae
        or nozzle) according to the methods of the present invention can
        be lowered into drilled oil wells. Using the methods of the
        present invention, the petroleum-based materials can be
        vaporized and collected at surface-level and processed using
        techniques known in the art. FIG. 5A illustrates a schematic
        view of a microwave system for in situ recovery of oil from
        geologic deposits. A suitable geologic deposit 526 includes an
        oil well, a capped oil well, a shale rock deposit, a tar sand
        deposit, a coal deposit, and the like. This illustration depicts
        a vacuum recovery unit 502 (e.g., a Venturi type system) for
        recovering geologic hydrocarbons such as fossil fuels from a
        capped oil well. This system comprises casing 504 extending from
        the surface of the ground to the geologic carbon deposits at
        526. A microwave waveguide is delivered through the casing to
        the geologic carbon deposit 526. A microwave antenna nozzle 510
        resides at the end of the microwave waveguide 506 proximate to
        the geologic carbon deposit, into which microwaves radiate. On
        the ground surface is illustrated portable electric generator
        522, portable pumping system 524, and portable microwave
        generation station control unit 520. Hydrocarbon vapors
        generated by the microwaves in the geologic carbon deposit 526
        are transported under vacuum as vaporized geologic carbon
        deposit (e.g., oil vapor) 508 to the vacuum recovery unit on the
        surface ground. Capped oil wells contain hydrocarbons that can
        be cracked to oil, suitable for use as diesel fuel. This
        involves opening up capped oil wells, optionally adding electron
        activator into the wells (which aid in absorbing the microwaves
        and converting the heavy oil in the wells to hydrocarbon vapor),
        and irradiating the heavy hydrocarbons with microwaves. Once
        vaporized, the hydrocarbons are readily transported to the
        surface using suitable vacuum piping, or other plumbing means
        528. The vacuum recovery unit 502 is also capable of
        fractionating the hydrocarbons into other hydrocarbon products.
        Oils that are difficult to recover using normal pumping means
        can be recovered according to the processes. </p>
      <p>[0110] FIG. 5B depicts an apparatus of the present invention
        for recovering petroleum-based materials from oil shale, in
        situ. A probe capable of generating microwave radiation
        according to the methods of the present invention, can be
        lowered into oil shale deposits. Using the methods of the
        present invention, the petroleum-based materials can be
        vaporized and collected at surface level and processed using
        techniques known in the art. FIG. 5B illustrates a schematic
        view of a microwave system for recovering hydrocarbons below
        ground. In this embodiment, one or more microwave antennae are
        shown capable of traveling horizontally underground with respect
        to the ground surface. The microwave antennae are illustrated
        comprising one or more microwave nozzles for vaporizing
        hydrocarbon geological deposits in a vacuum environment. FIG. 5B
        illustrates two conduits (on the left portion of the figure),
        each containing a plurality of waveguides that terminate it into
        a suitable microwave nozzle or cone emitter. Suitable microwave
        cones emitters are commercially available. This process is
        adapted for recovering residual oil in capped oil wells, and can
        also be adapted to other geological hydrocarbon deposits such as
        tar sands and shale rock. If the oil well is "dry" with mainly
        heavy viscous hydrocarbon material remaining in the well, a
        microwave antenna is transported down into the oil well and the
        antenna-end can reside in one or more of the openings. Microwave
        radiation is directed towards the geologic material in the
        vicinity of the antenna. </p>
      <p>[0111] Various hydrocarbon geological deposits can be processed
        underground using this technology at various depths. Piping for
        the wells can start at a diameter of about 24 inches at the
        surface, which diameter is progressively narrower and narrower
        as sections of piping are added as the depth increases. At a
        depth of approximately 3000 feet, a typical opening (diameter)
        of the piping is about 6 inches. For example oil shale deposits
        in the Western part of the United States are relatively shallow,
        i.e., near the surface. Strip mines are also relatively shallow,
        and other deposits may be as deep as 2000 feet or more.
        Previously pumped oil wells often have chambers of oil that are
        not readily accessible but require opening by an additional
        explosive or drilling operation. Certain chambers can also be
        opened by irradiating the sealing rock material with microwaves.
        In a laboratory setting, it has been discovered that oil shale
        pops and reduces in size when irradiated with microwaves. As the
        oil shale releases hydrocarbons (i.e. oil), the oil shale "pops"
        like popcorn. Accordingly, directionalizing microwaves within
        the geological chambers can give rise to breakdown of the
        geological formation (i.e. the rocks pop, break apart, and fall
        down and fill the cavity). Accordingly, the antennas can be
        moved around within geological formations to aid in recovering
        hydrocarbon material. In some embodiments microwave antennas are
        placed down about 5000 feet or more, and then are
        directionalized to travel on the order of approximately 100
        yards or so horizontally. </p>
      <p>[0112] Any type of hydrocarbon material present within the
        geological formation can be cracked to gas and recovered at the
        surface using fractionalization condensation units. For example,
        any carbon suitable for use as diesel fuel can be made by
        irradiating oil shale. Resulting diesel fuel is suitably used as
        Cat Diesel Engine Oil. Sometimes oil wells are drilled using
        directional drilling technologies. Suitable directional drilling
        technologies are capable of bending at a rate of a degree a foot
        to create an angle. Accordingly, flexible microwave antennas are
        suitable for use in such oils. Accordingly, the process includes
        uncapping a capped oil well. This can be accomplished by
        drilling out a concrete plug used to cap the well, if present. </p>
      <p>[0113] The system can include a number of auxiliary equipment
        located on the surface of the ground. Such equipment includes,
        for example, well drilling equipment, vacuum pump vehicle, fuel
        tank vehicles, a generator vehicle, and microwave control
        vehicle that includes microwave generators, microwave
        waveguides, and associated equipment. The vacuum pump vehicle
        can contain a vacuum pump that is capable of applying
        intermittent vacuum pulse technology to raise hydrocarbon gases
        to the surface. The hydrocarbon gases are recovered and
        collected in a suitable distillation tower or fractionation
        tower that is fitted with heat exchanger and condensing unit.
        Suitable oil wells and other hydrocarbon geological deposits
        residing in the ground are accessed via a tube to provide a
        sealed system with the vacuum pump vehicle for producing the
        vacuum environment needed for recovering a hydrocarbon vapors.
        Suitable vacuums include absolute pressures of less than about
        20 mm of mercury, or even less than about 40 mm of mercury, or
        even less than about 100 mm of mercury. The microwave control
        vehicle contains suitable flexible microwave waveguides and
        generators. Typically the end of the microwave waveguides (e.g.,
        antennas) are fitted with a suitable microwave cone emitter
        (e.g., nozzle). The antennas are placed into the mahogany zone
        in Earth in situ and microwaves are used to radiate tar sands,
        or oil shale, or other hydrocarbon deposits. The microwaves
        cause vaporization and gasification of the otherwise viscous and
        solid-like hydrocarbon and carbon geological sources within the
        ground. One or more antenna fitted with one or more cone emitter
        devices can be used. </p>
      <p>[0114] Generated hydrocarbon gases (e.g., take off gases) are
        transported to a suitable fractionation tower capable of
        separating the gas, as illustrated in FIG. 5C. Geological
        material such as sand and rock from which hydrocarbons have been
        removed remain within the geological formation. In some
        embodiments, an in situ microwave process is provided. Other
        embodiments do not require in situ microwave irradiation of the
        geological formation, e.g., geological material containing
        hydrocarbons that are mined and provided via separate feed
        mechanism into a suitable microwave reactor. Geological material
        such as sand and rock can be substantially totally gasified
        (i.e., depleted of hydrocarbons and carbons) according to the
        processes of the present invention, which geological material is
        then returned to the environment substantially free of
        hydrocarbons. Finally, fuel and other hydrocarbons recovered
        form the geological source can be stored in a suitable tanker
        vehicle and shipped for delivery, further processing, and so on.
        The recovered hydrocarbons may also be transported by pipeline,
        rail car, and the like. Optionally, the hydrocarbon vapor
        recovered from geological sources may be fractionalized on-site
        using a suitable distillation tower, as illustrated in FIG. 5A.
        The process of operating a distillation tower is suitably
        described in FIG. 5C, which illustration shows the separation of
        crude oil using a fractionating tower into its component
        products. </p>
      <p>[0115] FIG. 6 depicts one embodiment for extracting
        petroleum-based materials from shale and tar sands and oil
        sands. The tar sands can be loaded into the top of the
        apparatus, which can be under reduced pressure. Using gravity
        and shaking, the tar sands move through the apparatus while
        being exposed to microwave radiation as described herein.
        Vaporized petroleum-based materials can be captured and
        collected in separate vessels and refined using methods known in
        the art. After the material has passed through the apparatus, it
        will be essentially free of petroleum-based materials. FIG. 6
        provides an elevation view of a multiple microwave reactor
        system suitable for high volume recovery of petroleum, carbon
        and hydrocarbons (e.g. diesel oil) from mined material, e.g.,
        oil shale, oil sands, coal slag, and tar sands. This system is
        illustrated having the following equipment: microwave waveguide
        602; microwave antennas 620; vacuum gas line 604; microwave
        reactors 606--a total of five connected in series; connecting
        pipe 608 between microwave reactors 606; top airlock 610
        adjacent to in-feed of surface shale and tar sand material;
        airlock 612 adjacent to discharge of depleted material; baffles
        614 within vertically oriented microwave reactors 606; support
        structure 630 to support multiple microwave reactors connected
        in series and adjacent to source of surface shale and/or tar
        sands. Mined material enters the system at airlock in-feed 610,
        which minimizes the amount of air entering the system. The
        system is also fitted with a suitable vacuum gas line 604 to
        maintain a vacuum environment (vacuum pumping equipment not
        shown) of up to about 20 mm of mercury, or even up to about 40
        mm of mercury, or even up to about 100 mm of mercury. Material
        enters the first microwave reactors 606 adjacent to the airlock,
        which material is transported along baffles 614 while being
        irradiated with microwave radiation through microwave antennas
        620 (as illustrated in the second through fourth microwave
        reactors 606). Microwaves irradiate, heat, and crack the
        hydrocarbons, which hydrocarbons exit the system via a vacuum
        gas line 604 (connections between the microwave reactors 606 in
        the vacuum gas line 604 not shown). Geological material leaves
        the topmost microwave reactor 606 and enters a first connecting
        pipe 608, which partially reacted material is transported to a
        second microwave reactor 606. The process is repeated and the
        material is subsequently transported and irradiated with
        microwaves as it progresses along the series of microwave
        reactors and connecting tubes. The processed material eventually
        arrives at the bottom discharge, where it exits the system
        through an airlock 612. </p>

        invention is depicted in FIG. 7. FIG. 7 is a schematic view of a
        microwave reactor chamber and system for recovering fuel oil

        using mixing flight bars 1020 as the drum is rotated using the
        hydraulic drive system 1008. The drum reactor is maintained
        under vacuum by means of vacuum pumps 1007 and vacuum gas line.
        The reactor drum is vacuum sealed by means of a drum bearing

        generated at 1001 and transmitted by waveguides 1018 into the
        drum reactor 1004. Mixing flight bars 1020 are used for mixing
        materials within the rotating reactor drum 1004. Bearings 1022
        are used for slidably rotating the drum while maintaining the
        vacuum and microwave antenna connections. The reactor drum
        rotates by means of axel 1024 through actuation with the
        hydraulic drive transmission center 1008. Hydrocarbon vapors are
        removed through the vacuum gas line 1016 and collected for
        further processing as described herein above. Spent materials

      <p>[0131] Electron activator. It has been discovered that
        microwave radiation in the frequency range of from about 4 GHz
        to about 12 GHz is useful for selectively recovering hydrocarbon
        materials from geological petroleum and mineral sources, as well
        as manufactured materials such as automobile and truck tires. It
        has further been found that such materials can comprise carbon
        particles that absorb energy when irradiated with microwave
        radiation. The heat from the energized carbon particles is
        released to the adjacent hydrocarbon materials, and when
        sufficient heat is released, the hydrocarbons are reduced in
        molecular weight, i.e., "cracked", and vaporized. Unlike the
        prior art, the present discovery discloses a particular range of
        frequencies that is efficacious for the electromagnetic
        stimulation and heating of carbon particles for recovering
        hycrocarbons, such as diesel fuel, from difficult to recover
        hydrocarbon sources. </p>
      <p>[0132] Disclosed are methods for microwave treatment of
        difficult-to-recover hydrocarbon source materials comprising
        contacting the hydrocarbon source material with particles
        comprising carbon, and subjecting the hydrocarbon source
        material to microwave radiation. Also disclosed are methods for
        microwave treatment of hydrocarbon source material comprising
        contacting the hydrocarbon source material with material having
        a resonating frequency in the range of from about 4 GHz to about
        12 GHz, and subjecting the hydrocarbon source material to
        microwave radiation characterized as having at least one
        frequency component that corresponds to the resonating frequency
        of the material. As used herein, carbon particles or material
        having a resonating frequency corresponding to the applied
        microwave radiation frequency are collectively referred to as
        "electron activator". </p>
      <p>[0133] In preferred embodiments of the disclosed methods, the
        microwave radiation is one or more pre-selected microwave
        radiation frequencies. Preferably, the pre-selected microwave
        radiation frequency will be the resonating microwave frequency,
        i.e., the microwave radiation frequency at which the particles
        comprising carbon absorb a maximum amount of microwave
        radiation. It has been determined that different compositions of
        the present invention will absorb more or less microwave
        radiation, depending on the frequency of the microwave radiation
        applied. It has also been determined that the frequency at which
        maximum microwave radiation is absorbed differs by composition.
        By using methods known in the art, a composition of the present
        invention can be subjected to different frequencies of microwave
        radiation and the relative amounts of microwave radiation
        absorbed can be determined. Preferably, the microwave radiation
        selected is the frequency that comparatively results in the
        greatest amount of microwave radiation absorption. In one
        embodiment, the pre-selected microwave radiation frequency is
        characterized as having at least one frequency component in the
        range of from about 4 GHz to about 12 GHz. In other embodiments,
        the pre-selected microwave radiation frequency is characterized
        as having at least one frequency component in the range of from
        about 5 GHz to about 9 GHz, from about 6 GHz to about 8 GHz, or
        from about 6.5 GHz to about 7.5 GHz. </p>
      <p>[0134] The particles comprising carbon are preferably carbon
        substances that have a resonating microwave frequency of from
        about 4 GHz to about 12 GHz. Many forms of carbon are known by
        those skilled in the art, and, while not intending to exclude
        other carbon types, it is contemplated that any form of carbon
        having a resonating microwave frequency of from about 4 GHz to
        about 12 GHz will be within the scope of the present invention.
        For example, the particles comprising carbon can comprise carbon
        black. Carbon black may be described as a mixture of
        incompletely-burned hydrocarbons, produced by the partial
        combustion of natural gas or fossil fuels. </p>
      <p>[0135] Carbon blacks have chemisorbed oxygen complexes (e.g.,
        carboxylic, quinonic, lactonic, phenolic groups and others) on
        their surfaces to varying degrees depending on the conditions of
        manufacture. These surface oxygen groups are collectively
        referred to as the volatile content. In preferred embodiments,
        the present invention uses carbon black having a moderate
        volatile content. The volatile content of the preferred carbon
        black can be composed of hydrocarbons having up to about 20
        carbon atoms, or even up to about 30 carbon atoms. </p>
      <p>[0136] The constituent parts of the electron activator
        preferably have characteristic dimensions in the micrometer
        range, although other particle or fragment sizes may also be
        used. Because carbon particles or particles comprising another
        electron activator for use in the present invention can be
        present in numerous configurations, and can be irregular in
        shape, the term "characteristic dimensions" is used herein to
        describe the long axis in the case of substantially cylindrical
        or otherwise oblong particles, and to describe diameter in the
        case of substantially spherical particles, etc. In some
        embodiments wherein the carbon particles comprise carbon black,
        the particles can have characteristic dimensions of about 10 nm
        to about 250 .mu.m. In other embodiments, the particles can have
        characteristic dimensions of about 100 nm to about 100 .mu.m, or
        of about 200 nm to about 10 .mu.m. </p>
      <p>[0137] Preferred are electron activators having characteristic
        dimensions that are conducive to ready dispersion within
        hydrocarbon materials that are targeted for vaporization. The
        electron activators can be contacted with the hydrocarbon
        materials by directly introducing the electron activators into
        the hydrocarbon materials environment. </p>
      <p>[0138] In the present systems, the electron activator particles
        can comprise any material that is capable of absorbing at least
        a portion of the transmitted microwave radiation generated by
        the microwave generator. In preferred embodiments the material
        comprises carbon. The particles comprising carbon are preferably
        carbon substances that have a resonating microwave frequency of
        from about 4 GHz to about 12 GHz. Many forms of carbon are known
        by those skilled in the art, and, while not intending to exclude
        other carbon types, it is contemplated that any form of carbon
        having a resonating microwave frequency of from about 4 GHz to
        about 12 GHz will be within the scope of the present invention.
        For example, the particles comprising carbon can comprise carbon
        black. Carbon blacks have chemisorbed oxygen complexes (e.g.,
        carboxylic, quinonic, lactonic, phenolic groups and others) on
        their surfaces to varying degrees depending on the conditions of
        manufacture. These surface oxygen groups are collectively
        referred to as the volatile content. In preferred embodiments,
        the present invention uses carbon black having a moderate
        volatile content prepared by processing tire chips using
        microwave radiation as described herein above. </p>
      <p>[0139] The constituent parts of the particles preferably have
        characteristic dimensions in the micrometer range, although
        other particle or fragment sizes may also be used. Because
        carbon particles or particles comprising another electron
        activator for use in the present invention can be present in
        numerous configurations, and can be irregular in shape, the term
        "characteristic dimensions" is used herein to describe the long
        axis in the case of substantially cylindrical or otherwise
        oblong particles, and to describe diameter in the case of
        substantially spherical particles, etc. In some embodiments
        wherein the carbon particles comprise carbon black, the
        particles can have characteristic dimensions of about 100 .mu.m.

      <p><b>EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>[0140] The following examples are provided to further describe
        the present invention. They are not to be construed to limit the
        scope of the invention described in the claims. Many of the
        examples make use of the apparatus substantially illustrated and
        described in FIG. 7. </p>
      <p><b>Example 1</b> </p>
      <p>[0141] A chamber capable of being subjected to between 4.0 to
        12.0 GHz of microwave radiation frequencies and rated to
        withstand reduced atmospheric pressure, was equipped with a 700
        W, 5.8 to 7.0 GHz VFM microwave tube (Lambda Technologies,
        Morrisville, N.C.). The chamber was outfitted with a nitrogen
        gas inlet tube, a vacuum inlet tube, and an outlet tube
        connected to a heat exchanger and collection vessel. The chamber
        was also equipped with an infrared thermocouple temperature
        probe. </p>
      <p><b>Example 2</b> </p>
      <p>[0142] A chamber capable of being subjected to between 4.0 to
        12.0 GHz of microwave radiation frequencies and rated to
        withstand reduced atmospheric pressure, was equipped with a 1800
        W, 7.3 to 8.7 GHz VFM microwave tube (Lambda Technologies,
        Morrisville, N.C.). The chamber was outfitted with an nitrogen
        gas inlet tube, a vacuum inlet tube, and an outlet tube
        connected to a heat exchanger and collection vessel. The chamber
        was also equipped with an infrared thermocouple temperature
        probe. </p>
      <p><b>Example 3</b> </p>
      <p>[0143] A 20 lb automobile tire was cut into approximately
        4''.times.4'' pieces. These pieces were washed and dried. The
        pieces were placed on a tray and loaded into the chamber of
        Example 1. Twenty psi of N.sub.2 was introduced into the
        chamber. The VFM microwave radiation was initiated (700 W,
        5.8-7.0 GHz). When the temperature of the tire pieces reached
        465.degree. F., the microwave radiation was halted and the tire
        pieces allowed to cool about 5-25.degree. F. Microwave radiation
        was resumed. This process was repeated an additional three
        times. Total experiment run time was approximately twelve
        minutes. The decomposition products were then analyzed. </p>
      <p>[0144] This experiment produced 1.2 gallons of #4 oil (see
        Tables 1 and 2), 7.5 lbs of carbon black, 50 cu. ft. of
        combustible gases (including methane, ethane, propane, butane,
        and isobutene), and 2 lbs of steel. FIGS. 9A-9C depict electron
        microscope photographs of samples of carbon black produced using
        this method. FIG. 9C demonstrates that the carbon black produced
        by this method is comparable to commercial-grade rubber black.

              Microwave Technology is Featured in Philadelphia Inquirer</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>WEST BERLIN, N.J., Dec. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Global
        Resource Corp. , a developer of a patent-pending microwave
        technology and machinery for extracting oil and gas, announced
        today that the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i> in its Monday,
        December 3 Business Section, featured the company's microwave
        technology for producing fuel. </p>
      <p>The article describes the company's technology for making fuels
        from old tires. It also reports on the microwave technology's
        potential for cleaning the dredge from rivers as well as
        disposing of worn-out tires. </p>
      <p>Chairman Frank Pringle of General Resource Corp. said,
        "Pennsylvania needs help in cleaning up its river bottoms and
        getting rid of old tires and we think our process can help. As
        the article notes, Global Resource's microwave technology has
        the power to clean up these environmental problem areas and
        produce much needed energy to heat our homes and run our cars in
        an emission- free process." </p>
      <p>The article also said that "Last week, Dinesh Agrawal
        (http://www.inform.com/Dinesh+Agrawal), director of Pennsylvania
        State University's Microwave Processing and Engineering Center,
        signed a contract with Pringle's company, Global Resource Corp.
        of West Berlin, N.J., to help him get funding and develop
        large-scale applications." </p>
      <p>The article also quoted the professor as saying "It is very,
        very significant, what he has done," said Agrawal, a professor
        who has been studying microwave uses for 20 years. </p>
      <p>The article is just a latest recognition of Global Resource
        Corp.'s groundbreaking microwave technology for producing usable
        fuels in an emission- free process. The company also noted that
        in a report made in June that was released July 17, the U.S.
        Department of Energy profiled Global Resource and its microwave
        technology for oil shale recovery as a help in making the U.S.
        energy independent. </p>
      <p>In addition, <i>Popular Science Magazine</i> selected Chairman
        Frank Pringle as a "Green Tech Innovator" and General Resource
        Corp.'s microwave technology as one of its "Best of What's New
        '07." </p>
      <p><i>Time Magazine</i> also selected the company's microwave
        technology as one of the "Best Inventions of the Year" because
        of its ability to "pull fuel out of shale rock, tires and even
        plastic bottles." In its annual round up of "Best Inventions of
        the Year," Time Magazine selected 46 inventions in 12
        categories, from Cars &amp; Buses to Health. Global Resource's
        microwave technology is included in the environment category. </p>
      <p><i>About Global Resource Corp.</i> </p>
      <p>Global Resource Corp., is a developer of a patent-pending
        microwave technology and machinery that extracts oil and
        petroleum products from shale deposits, tar sands, capped oil
        wells, bituminous coal and processed materials such as tires and
        plastics as well as dredged soil from harbors and river bottoms.
        Its process produces significantly greater yields and lower
        costs than are available using existing technologies. Because
        the process takes place in an enclosed environment it is
        emission-free and an efficient and cost-effective tool for
        cleaning environmental wastes and toxic materials... </p>

              Arizona</font></b> </p>
        <p>by <b>Ryan Randazzo</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Dinner-plate sized pieces of rubber hurl from the screeching
        shredder as a tractor dumps another ton of used auto tires into
        its maw, which resembles a grossly oversized kitchen garbage
        disposal. </p>
      <p>What rubber doesn't haphazardly escape out the top of the
        machine comes out the bottom resembling the filling for a
        massive machaca burrito, and Steve Robinson watches as it
        streams by on a conveyor belt. </p>
      <p>"There's a new black gold," Robinson chuckles over the roar of
        the front-end loader and shredder. </p>
      <p>Robinson has been gathering tires for one reason or another for
        about 10 years, first as a volunteer project to help his
        dirt-bike-riding son clean up the desert, and later for
        commercial clean-ups. </p>
      <p>Now he sells the shredded rubber as far away as Europe to be
        used for cushioned ground cover in children's playgrounds, but
        he's been stockpiling for a higher cause, he said. </p>
      <p>Robinson's company, Envirotech Industries, has formed a joint
        venture with a California group, Huntington Renewable Energy,
        that wants to buy a giant microwave machines from New Jersey to
        "cook" the tires into heating oil, natural gas, carbon and
        steel, all of which would be recycled. </p>
      <p>The microwave machines would come from New Jersey's Global
        Resources Corp. The company has won accolades for its microwave
        technology breakthroughs in the laboratory, including from
        Popular Science and Time magazine, but has yet to prove it works
        on a large scale. </p>
      <p><i>New technology</i> </p>
      <p>Global Resources CEO Frank Pringle said other potential
        customers have requested plans for systems but not yet placed
        orders. Global Resources offers the large-scale machines for $5
        million to $6 million, and he said they are a better use for
        scrap tires than playground ground cover or incinerators that
        burn them for energy. </p>
      <p>"They are taking tires on the East Coast and using it to (burn
        and) make concrete," Pringle said. "It really is a waste of
        these materials." </p>
      <p>Pringle said his Hawk 10 microwave machines will recover more
        than a gallon of diesel fuel, 50 cubic feet of gas, two pounds
        of steel and seven pounds of carbon from a 20-pound tire.
        Furthermore, he says it can be done without using any water and
        without any emissions, because the process will take place in a
        vacuum. </p>
      <p>But aren't tires made of rubber? </p>
      <p>"Damn little of it," Pringle said, noting that most
        manufacturers use oil-based materials.The technology works
        simply by bombarding the tires with various microwave
        frequencies to break them into simpler components, much like a
        kitchen microwave oven uses particular frequencies to heat food.
      </p>
      <p>In a video of the Global Resources laboratory posted online, a
        researcher is shown placing shredded rubber into a device that
        looks much like an industrial refrigerator, turning the machine
        on, and returning to recover a small vial of oil that has
        drained off, a dry handful of black carbon powder, and enough of
        gas piped through a hose to ignite a small flame from a
        laboratory burner. </p>
      <p>The larger machines designed to process tons of tires will
        churn the ground tires in a vacuum much like a giant washing
        machine while zapping them with microwaves, capturing the oil
        that can be condensed and the gas as it drifts off. </p>
      <p>The result is flammable gas they hope to sell to natural gas
        wholesalers and a petroleum oil that can be mixed with heating
        oil, and Eco has hopes to sell most of the products if and when
        the microwaves start up. </p>
      <p>Another end product is black carbon, which can be used in ink
        and carbon-fiber athletic equipment. </p>
      <p>Eco hopes to be in operation in Arizona by fall 2008, if
        permitting goes smoothly. </p>
      <p>Pringle "stumbled upon" the 18,000 or so frequencies of
        microwaves that work well with tires among the 10 million or so
        possible frequencies when he was researching how to use the
        technology to recycle glass. He thought to test frequencies on
        tires after seeing a massive tire fire. </p>
      <p>"I don't know if God blessed me or burdened me with this," he
        said of the research. </p>
      <p><i>Building supply</i> </p>
      <p>Robinson's truck drifts along the highway south of Phoenix near
        his stockpile before he jerks to the side, pointing to a pile of
        about a dozen tires hidden behind the scraggly desert brush. </p>
      <p>"Those weren't there last week," he exclaims. He sends workers
        along the highway to pick up such illegal dumps, which he said
        come from tire dealers. He also has been buying tires from
        different collectors, hoping to stockpile enough to run the Hawk
        10 microwaves for six months at his facility in the Sonoran
        Desert National Monument. </p>
      <p>"Instead of people dropping them off in the desert, I see a
        line of people coming in to Envirotech," Robinson said. </p>
      <p>Because the facility is in the national monument that was
        created in 2001, it is important the technology doesn't have any
        dangerous emissions, he said. </p>
      <p>Huntington Renewable Energy of California and Robinson are in
        joint venture known as Eco Renewable Energy to buy the Hawk 10
        equipment from Global Resource Corp. </p>
      <p>Huntington Renewable investors were looking for an energy
        project to invest in, and Robinson was looking for a way to
        market his tires for the best use. </p>
      <p>"We settled on this system as the best available," said David
        Runnion, the CEO of Huntington and president of Eco. "It's
        making use of something that is a big bane to society." </p>
      <p>Eco has an agreement with its bank to buy the facility, sell it
        to the bank and lease it back, Runnion said. The company is
        getting its money from Canadian investors who he declined to
        identify. </p>
      <p>The Arizona plant will cost an estimated $44 million, and the
        company hopes to build others. </p>
      <p>The Hawk machines require lots of electricity to operate, but
        are expected to produce much more energy in the form of natural
        gas and oil than they will require to run. Eco officials hope to
        process 10 tons of shredded tire material an hour. </p>
      <p>"If we can separate ourselves from foreign oil, every bit
        helps," Robinson said. </p>
      <p><i>Will it work?</i> </p>
      <p>Arizona Department of Environmental Quality officials said they
        couldn't comment on the plans for the tire-recycling facility,
        because they hadn't seen an application for it yet. </p>
      <p>Other experts on the technology are hard to come by, being that
        it is not in use on a large scale anywhere. </p>
      <p>Dinesh Agrawal, a materials-science professor and director of
        the Microwave Processing and Engineering Center at Penn State,
        said he has seen the microwave technology turn rubber to oil. He
        has a research agreement with Global Resources to explore using
        microwaves to recover fuel from oil shale. </p>
      <p>"On a smaller scale, it works very nice," Agrawal said. "In a
        few minutes it can convert a tire, oil shale and even plastics
        into useful products." </p>
      <p>But that's no guarantee it will work on a large scale, he said.
      </p>
      <p>"To do it on a larger scale is a totally different story,"
        Agrawal said. "You need to go from a few grams (of recycled
        material) to a few tons. That scaling operation is a very
        challenging job. Somebody has to take the risk to fund that kind
        that kind of project. It is not a trivial task." </p>

        <p><b>THE MICROWAVE MAGICIAN</b> </p>
        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Rena M Pacella</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Frank Pringle has found a way to squeeze oil and gas from just
        about anything </p>
      <p>I’m not sure if I’m watching a magic trick, or an invention
        that will make the cigar-chomping 64-year-old next to me the
        richest man on the planet. Everything that goes into Frank
        Pringle’s recycling machine — a piece of tire, a rock, a plastic
        cup — turns to oil and natural gas seconds later. “I’ve been
        told the oil companies might try to assassinate me,” Pringle
        says without sarcasm. </p>
      <p>The machine is a microwave emitter that extracts the petroleum
        and gas hidden inside everyday objects — or at least anything
        made with hydrocarbons, which, it turns out, is most of what’s
        around you. Every hour, the first commercial version will turn
        10 tons of auto waste — tires, plastic, vinyl — into enough
        natural gas to produce 17 million BTUs of energy (it will use
        956,000 of those BTUs to keep itself running). </p>
      <p>Pringle created the machine about 10 years ago after he drove
        by a massive tire fire and thought about the energy being
        released. He went home and threw bits of a tire in a microwave
        emitter he’d been working with for another project. It turned to
        what looked like ash, but a few hours later, he returned and
        found a black puddle on the floor of the unheated workshop.
        Somehow, he’d struck oil. </p>
      <p>Or rather, he had extracted it. Petroleum is composed of
        strings of hydrocarbon molecules. When microwaves hit the tire,
        they crack the molecular chains and break it into its component
        parts: carbon black (an ash-like raw material) and hydrocarbon
        gases, which can be burned or condensed into liquid fuel.
        Pringle figured that some gases from his microwaved tire had
        lingered, and the cold air in the shop had condensed them into
        diesel. If the process worked on tires, he thought, it should
        work on anything with hydrocarbons. The trick was in finding the
        optimum microwave frequency for each material — out of 10
        million possibilities. </p>
      <p>Pringle has spent 10 years and $1 million homing in on
        frequencies for hundreds of materials. In 2004 he teamed up with
        engineer pal Hawk Hogan to take the machine commercial. </p>
      <p>Their first order is under construction in Rockford, Illinois.
        It’s a $5.1-million microwave machine the size of small bus
        called the Hawk, bound for an auto-recycler in Long Island, New
        York. More deals loom: The U.S. military may use Hawks in Iraq
        on waste such as water bottles and food containers. Oil
        companies are looking to the machines to gasify petroleum
        trapped in shale. </p>
      <p>Back at the shop, Pringle is still zapping new materials. A
        sample labeled “bituminous coal” goes in and, 15 seconds later,
        Pringle ignites the resulting gas. “You see,” he says, “why they
        might want to kill me.” </p>
