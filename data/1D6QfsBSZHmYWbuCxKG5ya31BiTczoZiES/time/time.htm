      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Time travel might a science
          fiction fantasy, but time cameras have been a reality for
          several decades. And for all that the public knows or not,
          travel into the past (if not the future) might also be an
          accomplished fact. There are a few claimants to that effect,
          namely Preston Nichols and company, who have published a
          series of books (however dubious) about the "Montauk Project"
          in New Jersey during the 1960s (plus or minus hundreds of
          years).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1912, Baron Ernst von
          Lubek published an account of his accounts with trans-time
          photography. His equipment included a cathode ray tube with
          lead and dysprosium electrodes, energized by an Oudin coil (a
          modified Tesla coil).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1934, William D. Pelley,
          editor of <i>Liberation</i> magazine, reported on his
          experiments with a form of time-camera which he called
          "Ultra-Vision", allegedly developed in collaboration with
          Thomas Edison and Steinmetz. The apparatus was confiscated by
          the FBI.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Radionic Camera
          developed in the 1950s by George DeLaWarr was capable of
          imaging the past and the future, and he published photographs
          demonstrating the effect. In the opinion of DeLaWarr, "Time is
          a vector of the magnetic spectrum and that spectrum has a
          place in itself for events... There is a pre-physical world in
          which the camera might be expected to operate".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Benedictine Father
          Marcello Pellegrino Ernetti (d. 1997) invented a method of
          recovering sound waves from the past and converting them into
          visual and acoustic reconstruction of history. Father Ernetti,
          a professor at the Venetian Benedetto Marcello Conservatory
          and Fondation Cini (and director of the Italian Conservatory
          of Religious Instruction for Men), accomplished his research
          in collaboration with 12 physicists who remain anonymous. In
          1956, Father Ernetti began to investigate the possibility of
          reviewing the past with a television-like device. In 1957 he
          began collaborating with the Portuguese Professor de Matos,
          who was researching the same problem.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ernetti's theoretical
          approach was based on Aristotle's concept of the
          disintegration of sound, according to which light and sound
          waves do not disappear after being produced, but are
          transformed in some way and remain present indefinitely.
          According to Ernetti, sound waves subdivide into harmonics
          that can be recovered with appropriate instruments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ernetti stated that, "Every
          human being traces from birth to death a double furrow of
          light and sounds. This constitutes his individual identity
          mark. The same applies to an event, to music, to movement. The
          antennas used in our laboratory enable us to tune in to these
          furrows of picture or sound".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ernetti recovered
          "photographs" of events such the Crucifixion of Christ, and
          reconstructed acoustic events such as Quintus Ennius' tragedy
          Thyestes in the original Latin from a performance in 169 BC.
          He also claimed to have recovered the original text of the Ten
          Commandments given to Moses. He refused to reveal any details
          of his invention, and it has been thoroughly suppressed by the
          Italian government.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fr. Ernetti warned that,
          "The machine can produce universal tragedy".</font> </p>
      <p>In February 2003, the Russian newspaper <i>Pravda</i> printed
        a story about an unidentified scientist who has developed a time
        camera that uses pure quartz lenses as a critical component.
        Following is an excerpt: </p>
      <p>"The object-glass is made of pure quartz, which lets
        ultraviolet radiation run through it without any losses. <br>
        As it turned out, it is the ultraviolet radiation that carries
        the images and the information of the past. We have already
        managed to take some pictures; for example, we photographed
        several days of World War II. I have a very good picture of two
        warriors, who aim their looks at the forest. Another picture
        depicts horsemen wearing pointed hats and holding bows and
        shields in their hands. There is an image of some leader with
        slanting eyes on their shields. We have another picture of a
        mammoth silhouette with big tusks standing against the
        background of some giant trees. This is a picture of the
        paleolith era." </p>
      <p>In 1897, two British men claimed to have invented a camera that
        could photgraph the past. William Maplebeck (67) and amateur
        photographer Robert Stookes (56), demonstrated their
        "chronoscope" at Esme Collings Photographers on Rodney Street in
        Liverpool. Maplebeck said that he had discovered an arrangement
        of mirrored quartz lenses which could project images of the past
        on a photographic plate in a random (uncontrolled) manner. The
        inventors showed magic lantern slides of cave men, Roman
        soldiers stationed in Chester, and an Elizabethan woman in the
        streets of Liverpool. The lecture was disrupted by jeers and
        cries of "Fraud!" and "Charlatans!". Maplebeck and Stokes put
        their invention into its case and left, as it was pointless to
        continue their lecture. </p>
      <p>The great scientist Charles Steinmetz allegedly developed a
        time camera that could photograph the past, based on a technical
        secret revealed to him by the Englishman Baird T. Spalding, also
        using quartz lenses. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While there are many
          theories about time, a few scientists have published the
          results of their experiments with the physics of time and its
          practical application. For example, in 1936 van Stockum solved
          the Einstein equations for the gravitational field of a
          rapidly rotating cylinder. He showed that it allows a closed
          time-like line to connect any two events in spacetime. This
          suggests that a finite, rotating cylinder would also act as a
          time machine, causing "nontrivial causality violations" (time
          travel). In the 1970s, physicist Frank Tipler described a
          theoretical two-way time machine comprising a cylinder
          spinning at a rate of at least one-half the speed of light.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Most notably, the Soviet
          astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev made an experimental study of
          the properties of time in the 1960s and 70s. He used
          electrified gyroscopes and pendulums to demonstrate the
          density or intensity of time:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There exists a variable
          property which can be called the density or intensity of
          time.... The density of time changes within broad limits,
          owing to the processes occurring in nature... It proves
          possible to have one material influence another through time.
          Such a relationship can be foreseen, since the
          causal-resultant relationship phenomena occurred not only in
          time, but also with the aid of time. Therefore, in each
          process of nature, time can be extended or formed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The effect of the causal
          pole depends only on the distance (spacing). Repeated and
          careful measurements demonstrated that this effect diminishes,
          not inversely proportional to the square of the distance, as
          in the case of force fields, but inversely proportional to the
          first power of the distance...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The results indicate that
          the nearer the system with the causal-resultant relationship
          the density of time actually changes... there occurs a
          thinning (rarefaction of time), while near the energy receiver
          its compaction takes place. The impression is gained that time
          is extended by a cause and, contrariwise, it becomes more
          advanced in that place where the effect is located."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In other words, time
          condenses or accelerates at the effective end of the karma
          stick. Kozyrev's research also offers a straightforward
          explanation for the phenomenon of prophecy:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The effect of time differs
          basically from the effect of force fields... The effect of the
          causal pole immediately creates two equal and opposite
          forces... There occurs a transmission, without momentum, and
          hence also without delivery... The transmission of energy
          without momentum (impulse) should have the following very
          important property: Such a transmission should be
          instantaneous... Time in the universe is not propagated but
          appears simultaneously everywhere. On a time axis the entire
          universe is projected by one point. Therefore, the altered
          properties of a given second will appear everywhere at once,
          diminishing according to the law of inverse proportionality of
          the first power of distance...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The possibility of
          communications through time will probably explain not only the
          features of biological relationships but also a number of
          puzzling phenomena of the physics of man. Perhaps intuitive
          knowledge is obtained specifically in this manner. It is quite
          likely that in this way are realized also the phenomena of
          telepathy: i.e., the transmission of thought over a distance.
          All these relationships are not shielded and hence have the
          property for the transmission of influence through time".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kozyrev also determined the
          speed of time = 700 km/second (+/- 50) in a left-hand system,
          and he discovered several other chronal properties and
          effects, including weight loss in gyroscopes (proportional to
          the weight and linear rate of rotation), different speeds in
          the N and S hemispheres, a deflection of pendulums to the
          south, time-shielding by dextro-rotary organic molecules
          (right-handed; i.e., sugar), time-absorption by laevorotary
          molecules (left-handed; i.e., turpentine), and time relaxation
          (inversely proportional to the square root of the body's
          density), and rotation moment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In lay terms, this means
          that it is entirely possible to manipulate time, and even to
          create the stuff as a side effect of work --- sort of like
          accumulating vacation time on the job.</font> </p>
