          flash</b><br>
        <i>'Green' process promises pristine graphene in bulk using
          waste food, plastic and other materials</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      That banana peel, turned into graphene, can help facilitate a
      massive reduction of the environmental impact of concrete and
      other building materials. While you're at it, toss in those
      plastic empties.<br>
      <br>
      A new process introduced by the Rice University lab of chemist
      James Tour can turn bulk quantities of just about any carbon
      source into valuable graphene flakes. The process is quick and
      cheap; Tour said the "flash graphene" technique can convert a ton
      of coal, food waste or plastic into graphene for a fraction of the
      cost used by other bulk graphene-producing methods.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a big deal," Tour said. "The world throws out 30% to 40%
      of all food, because it goes bad, and plastic waste is of
      worldwide concern. We've already proven that any solid
      carbon-based matter, including mixed plastic waste and rubber
      tires, can be turned into graphene."<br>
      <br>
      As reported in Nature, flash graphene is made in 10 milliseconds
      by heating carbon-containing materials to 3,000 Kelvin (about
      5,000 degrees Fahrenheit). The source material can be nearly
      anything with carbon content. Food waste, plastic waste, petroleum
      coke, coal, wood clippings and biochar are prime candidates, Tour
      said. "With the present commercial price of graphene being $67,000
      to $200,000 per ton, the prospects for this process look superb,"
      he said.<br>
      <br>
      Tour said a concentration of as little as 0.1% of flash graphene
      in the cement used to bind concrete could lessen its massive
      environmental impact by a third. Production of cement reportedly
      emits as much as 8% of human-made carbon dioxide every year.<br>
      <br>
      "By strengthening concrete with graphene, we could use less
      concrete for building, and it would cost less to manufacture and
      less to transport," he said. "Essentially, we're trapping
      greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane that waste food
      would have emitted in landfills. We are converting those carbons
      into graphene and adding that graphene to concrete, thereby
      lowering the amount of carbon dioxide generated in concrete
      manufacture. It's a win-win environmental scenario using
      graphene."<br>
      <br>
      "Turning trash to treasure is key to the circular economy," said
      co-corresponding author Rouzbeh Shahsavari, an adjunct assistant
      professor of civil and environmental engineering and of materials
      science and nanoengineering at Rice and president of C-Crete
      Technologies. "Here, graphene acts both as a 2D template and a
      reinforcing agent that controls cement hydration and subsequent
      strength development."<br>
      <br>
      In the past, Tour said, "graphene has been too expensive to use in
      these applications. The flash process will greatly lessen the
      price while it helps us better manage waste."<br>
      <br>
      "With our method, that carbon becomes fixed," he said. "It will
      not enter the air again."<br>
      <br>
      The process aligns nicely with Rice's recently announced Carbon
      Hub initiative to create a zero-emissions future that repurposes
      hydrocarbons from oil and gas to generate hydrogen gas and solid
      carbon with zero emission of carbon dioxide. The flash graphene
      process can convert that solid carbon into graphene for concrete,
      asphalt, buildings, cars, clothing and more, Tour said.<br>
      <br>
      Flash Joule heating for bulk graphene, developed in the Tour lab
      by Rice graduate student and lead author Duy Luong, improves upon
      techniques like exfoliation from graphite and chemical vapor
      deposition on a metal foil that require much more effort and cost
      to produce just a little graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Even better, the process produces "turbostratic" graphene, with
      misaligned layers that are easy to separate. "A-B stacked graphene
      from other processes, like exfoliation of graphite, is very hard
      to pull apart," Tour said. "The layers adhere strongly together.<br>
      <br>
      But turbostratic graphene is much easier to work with because the
      adhesion between layers is much lower. They just come apart in
      solution or upon blending in composites.<br>
      <br>
      "That's important, because now we can get each of these
      single-atomic layers to interact with a host composite," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The lab noted that used coffee grounds transformed into pristine
      single-layer sheets of graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Bulk composites of graphene with plastic, metals, plywood,
      concrete and other building materials would be a major market for
      flash graphene, according to the researchers, who are already
      testing graphene-enhanced concrete and plastic.<br>
      <br>
      The flash process happens in a custom-designed reactor that heats
      material quickly and emits all noncarbon elements as gas. "When
      this process is industrialized, elements like oxygen and nitrogen
      that exit the flash reactor can all be trapped as small molecules
      because they have value," Tour said.<br>
      <br>
      He said the flash process produces very little excess heat,
      channeling almost all of its energy into the target. "You can put
      your finger right on the container a few seconds afterwards," Tour
      said. "And keep in mind this is almost three times hotter than the
      chemical vapor deposition furnaces we formerly used to make
      graphene, but in the flash process the heat is concentrated in the
      carbon material and none in a surrounding reactor.<br>
      <br>
      "All the excess energy comes out as light, in a very bright flash,
      and because there aren't any solvents, it's a super clean
      process," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Luong did not expect to find graphene when he fired up the first
      small-scale device to find new phases of material, beginning with
      a sample of carbon black. "This started when I took a look at a
      Science paper talking about flash Joule heating to make
      phase-changing nanoparticles of metals," he said. But Luong
      quickly realized the process produced nothing but high-quality
      graphene.<br>
      <br>
      Atom-level simulations by Rice researcher and co-author Ksenia
      Bets confirmed that temperature is key to the material's rapid
      formation. "We essentially speed up the slow geological process by
      which carbon evolves into its ground state, graphite," she said.
      "Greatly accelerated by a heat spike, it is also stopped at the
      right instant, at the graphene stage.<br>
      <br>
      "It is amazing how state-of-the-art computer simulations,
      notoriously slow for observing such kinetics, reveal the details
      of high temperature-modulated atomic movements and
      transformation," Bets said.<br>
      <br>
      Tour hopes to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) a day of flash
      graphene within two years, starting with a project recently funded
      by the Department of Energy to convert U.S.-sourced coal. "This
      could provide an outlet for coal in large scale by converting it
      inexpensively into a much-higher-value building material," he
      said.<br>

          synthesis</b><br>
        <b>Duy X. Luong, <i>et al.</i></b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Most bulk-scale graphene is produced by a top-down approach,
      exfoliating graphite, which often requires large amounts of
      solvent with high-energy mixing, shearing, sonication or
      electrochemical treatment1,2,3. Although chemical oxidation of
      graphite to graphene oxide promotes exfoliation, it requires harsh
      oxidants and leaves the graphene with a defective perforated
      structure after the subsequent reduction step3,4. Bottom-up
      synthesis of high-quality graphene is often restricted to
      ultrasmall amounts if performed by chemical vapour deposition or
      advanced synthetic organic methods, or it provides a defect-ridden
      structure if carried out in bulk solution4,5,6. Here we show that
      flash Joule heating of inexpensive carbon sources—such as coal,
      petroleum coke, biochar, carbon black, discarded food, rubber
      tyres and mixed plastic waste—can afford gram-scale quantities of
      graphene in less than one second. The product, named flash
      graphene (FG) after the process used to produce it, shows
      turbostratic arrangement (that is, little order) between the
      stacked graphene layers. FG synthesis uses no furnace and no
      solvents or reactive gases. Yields depend on the carbon content of
      the source; when using a high-carbon source, such as carbon black,
      anthracitic coal or calcined coke, yields can range from 80 to 90
      per cent with carbon purity greater than 99 per cent. No
      purification steps are necessary. Raman spectroscopy analysis
      shows a low-intensity or absent D band for FG, indicating that FG
      has among the lowest defect concentrations reported so far for
      graphene, and confirms the turbostratic stacking of FG, which is
      clearly distinguished from turbostratic graphite. The disordered
      orientation of FG layers facilitates its rapid exfoliation upon
      mixing during composite formation. The electric energy cost for FG
      synthesis is only about 7.2 kilojoules per gram, which could
      render FG suitable for use in bulk composites of plastic, metals,
      plywood, concrete and other building materials.<br>

      Methods that expand the properties of laser-induced graphene (LIG)
      and the resulting LIG having the expanded properties. Methods of
      fabricating laser-induced graphene from materials, which range
      from natural, renewable precursors (such as cloth or paper) to
      high performance polymers (like Kevlar). With multiple lasing,
      however, highly conductive PEI- based LIG could be obtained using
      both multiple pass and defocus methods. The resulting
      laser-induced graphene can be used, inter alia, in electronic
      devices, as antifouling surfaces, in water treatment technology,
      in membranes, and in electronics on paper and food Such methods
      include fabrication of LIG in controlled atmospheres, such that,
      for example, superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic LIG surfaces
      can be obtained. Such methods further include fabricating
      laser-induced graphene by multiple lasing of carbon precursors.<br>
