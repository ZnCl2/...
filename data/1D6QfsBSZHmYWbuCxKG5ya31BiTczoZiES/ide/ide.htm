    <blockquote><b>Osamu Ide</b>, the head of the Japanese Green Cross
      Society's Clean Energy Laboratory, told about a motor developed by
      him, which operates by discharge of a capacitor in an LC circuit.
      The motor utilizes the magnetic attraction between a pair of coils
      (the stator) and a ferromagnetic core (configured as a rotor)
      which moves between the coils. The unconsumed magnetic energy is
      recycled by recharging the capacitor. Ide says he observed an
      unusual increase of recharge voltage, which occurs only when the
      magnetic fields of opposing coils are opposing each other. The
      ferromagnetic core does not receive negative torque during the
      discharge. Ide believes he is witnessing a possible over-unity
      effect and has published an article about his motor in the Journal
      of Applied Physics, 77 (11) of 1 June 1995, entitled "Increased

    <blockquote>The behavior of an LCR
      (inductance-capacitance-resistance) circuit with a movable
      ferromagnetic core is discussed. The core is attracted by a
      magnetic field generated by an electric current resulting from the
      discharge of a capacitor in the closed LCR circuit. An unusual
      increase in recharge voltage, which was dependent on the magnetic
      configuration of the coil, was observed. This voltage increase
      does not conform to the mathematical simulation of the system. The
      possibility that a positive electromotive force was involved in
      this effect is discussed.' </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>I. INTRODUCTION </b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The author has been developing a motor operated by the
      discharge of a capacitor in an LCR (inductance-capacitance-
      resistance) circuit. Unlike conventional dc motors, this motor
      utilizes the magnetic force of attraction between a current-
      carrying coil and a movable ferromagnetic core. The force of
      attraction between the two components resulting from the capacitor
      discharge is converted to a rotary force. The uncon- sumed
      magnetic energy is recycled as electrical energy by recharging the
      capacitor. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the course of developing this motor, it was
      discovered that the recharge voltage depends on the precise
      configuration of the system. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The purpose of this paper is to describe the increased
      voltage phenomenon observed in the above system. A differential
      equation that expresses the phenomenon, as. well as computer
      simulations, are also discussed. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is appropriate here to briefly discuss other machines
      based on a similar magnetic phenomenon. Many attempts have been
      made to operate machinery that utilizes the non- linear phenomenon
      of magnetism, such as ferroresonance1'2 and parametric resonance.3
      The basic features of these machines is the magnetic saturation
      effect. The machines primarily make use of the transition from a
      nonresonant state to a resonant state, i.e., from the high
      inductance of a nonsaturated state to the low inductance of a
      saturated state, converting these two modes to either oscillation
      or amplification. It should be noted that the present system is
      completely different from these machines, since there is no
      magnetic saturation in the coils. Voltage changes found in the
      system occur during the transition from a low-inductance state to
      a high-inductance state, and are not subjected to the sudden drop
      or rise typically associated with ferroresonance and parametric
      resonance. In other words, other systems operate in a closed
      magnetic field, whereas the system described here operates in an
      open magnetic field. Electrically, this system is basically
      closed, since the only power source used here is a charged
      capacitor; it has no ac power supply such as that used to operate
      other magnetic machines... </blockquote>

        V. DISCUSSION</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The mathematical analysis in the previous section
      reveals that the recharge voltage decreases as the core speed
      increases. With a constant core speed, it predicts that the
      recharge voltage will decrease as a increases. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The reason for the decrease in the recharge voltage can
      be given as follows. The displacement of the core during discharge
      means there is a mechanical output in the system. It is reasonable
      to conclude that the mechanical motion of the core is compensated
      for by a decrease in recharge voltage. The cause of the increase
      in the apparent resistance R is considered to be the back EMF
      generated by the movement of the core. For a constant rotor speed,
      it is clear that a coil with a large a has a large attracting
      force. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>However, the results differ in the case of the opposing
      mode. Though a is positive, r increases over the range up to a
      certain speed. After the peak, r decreases slightly but remains
      greater than the initial value. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>These results can be explained from the assumption that
      the complex movement of the flux could generate a positive EMF:
      the increase in the recharge voltage is due to an EMF in the same
      direction as the discharge current, different from the back EMF
      caused by Faraday's law. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The past controversy concerning electromagnetic induc-
      tion might shed some light on this viewpoint. On this topic,
      several authors have stated that the motional EMF caused by the
      cutting of the magnetic flux and the induced EMF caused by
      Faraday's law were independent phenomena.4'5 These two different
      types of EMF are generally expressed by the following equation: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>I (BXv)dl. Jo (12) </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It can be postulated that these two types of EMF have
      contradicting effects within the coil, and that the motional EMF
      has a positive effect on the recharge voltage over a certain range
      of core speed. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This hypothesis seems to be consistent with the results,
      but is also highly speculative. It would be necessary to confirm
      its validity through further experimentation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>VI. CONCLUSIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      In this paper, the behavior of an LCR circuit with a movable
      ferromagnetic core was discussed. The increase in the inductance
      of the coil, which is caused by the attraction of the core during
      discharge, yielded the following results. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(1) The recharge voltage is generally smaller when the
      core moves than when it is stationary. The decrease in the
      recharge voltage depends on the rate of change of the inductance.
      The simulation based on the theoretical equation confirmed the
      experimental results. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>(2) When applying opposing magnetic fields to the facing
      coils, an increase in the recharge voltage can be observed in an
      electrically closed LCR circuit. The apparent resistance of the
      coil decreased correspondingly. </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0in;">(3) It can be postulated
      that the complex movement of mag- netic flux generates a positive
      EMF, but the cause of the voltage increase is not clear.<br>

      Abstract<strong> -- </strong>PURPOSE:To effectively reduce
      internal loss and enhance efficiency, by forming a self-induction
      coil with superconducting substance. CONSTITUTION:A
      superconductive self-induction coil 22 is connected to spark
      discharge electrodes 16 and a rectifier 18 in series, and the
      series circuit and an electrostatic capacitor 12 are arranged in
      parallel with a DC power source 10 via a change-over switch 20. So
      far as the operation of this power supply circuit is concerned,
      first, the contact a of the change-over switch 20 is connected to
      a contact b1, and the electrostatic capacitor 12 is charged with
      the DC power source 10, and after that, by switching the contact a
      to a contact b3, the energy of the electrostatic capacitor 12 is
      sparkdischarged by the spark discharge electrodes 16 via the
      rectifier 18, and pulse-like current is fed to the coil 22.; By
      this current, a reverse-electromotive force is generated in the
      coil 22. By the superconduction of the coil 22, the resistance
      component of the circuit is reduced, and at the electrostatic
      capacitor 12, reverse-charging voltage approximating to 100 % of
      the initial charging voltage can be obtained. <br>

      magnetic substance made of soft magnetic material between
      respective winding layers. CONSTITUTION:Windings 12 are wound
      around and attached to the cervical section 10a of an iron core 10
      made of soft magnetic materials in order from the inside into a
      multilayered structure. On this occasion, a magnetic plate 14 made
      of soft magnetic materials is interposed between each pair of
      adjoining winding layers. As each winding layer 12 of the
      electromagnetic coil wound around and attached to the iron core 10
      adjoins a magnetic plate (magnetic plates) 14, in this way, a high
      magnetic field can be obtained. And, along with that, a
      high-inductance electromagnetic coil can be obtained.; Besides, as
      external magnetic flux phi1 or phi2 passes through the magnetic
      plates 14 put between layers of the windings 12 and the flux is
      almost prevented from interlinking each winding 12,
      counterelectromotive force in the direction the same as or reverse
      to the current flowing in the windings is hardly generated.
      Accordingly, the winding current hardly varies preventing such bad
      influence.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract:</b> Disclosed is a transformer whereby power
      outputted from the secondary-side output in correspondence with
      the primary-side input is oututted with higher efficiency than in
      conventional transformers. The disclosed transformer is provided
      with two or more cores and a primary coil and secondary coil wound
      around said coils. Two or more magnetic circuits formed by the
      aforementioned cores and either the primary coil or the secondary
      coil produce mutually opposing magnetic lines of force, and said
      cores are arranged with at least one gap therebetween.<br>
