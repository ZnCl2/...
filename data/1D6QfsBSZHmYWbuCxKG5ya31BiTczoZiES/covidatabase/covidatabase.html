                                                          I will try to
                                                          explain it in
                                                          a simple way.
                                                          We did this by
                                                          culturing
                                                          bacteria from
                                                          our microbiome
                                                          and the virus.
                                                          First, we took
                                                          the fecal swab
                                                          of some

                                                          patients and
                                                          cultured it
                                                          for up to 7.14
                                                          and 30 days,
                                                          seeing that
                                                          the virus
                                                          increased RNA
                                                          production.
                                                          Then, we took
                                                          the virus and
                                                          cultured it
                                                          with bacteria
                                                          from the fecal
                                                          swab of a
                                                          non-sick
                                                          person, seeing
                                                          that it was
                                                          replicating
                                                          here too.
                                                          Finally, we
                                                          took the
                                                          bacteria from
                                                          the first
                                                          experiment and
                                                          separated them
                                                          from the
                                                          virus! We grew
                                                          them on their
                                                          own and at 30
                                                          days they kept

                                                      and now it seems
                                                      that the first
                                                      strike may occur
                                                      but the country
                                                      finished would be

                                                      to the point that
                                                      the majority
                                                      accept their moral

                                                      That mindset can
                                                      play a key role in

                                                  may have contributed

                                                  very quickly, within
                                                  the first two or three
                                                  weeks in March [2020],
                                                  that it was fear.
                                                  Since then … the fear
                                                  … has morphed and
                                                  evolved, not just into
                                                  a ‘I’m worried, I’m
                                                  scared so I need to
                                                  stay home,’ but an
                                                  actual belief that is
                                                  against reality —
                                                  because the definition
                                                  of delusion is
                                                  something you believe
                                                  that doesn’t conform
                                                  with reality.</font></font><br>

                                              higher. The FDA says run
                                              the test up to 40 cycles,
                                              in order to determine

                                              Chinese experiments on

                                              broadcast in November,
                                              2015, showed how Chinese
                                              scientists were conducting
                                              biological experiments on

                                              bats and mice, asking
                                              whether it was worth the
                                              risk in order to be able
                                              to modify the virus for
                                              compatibility with human

                                              Coronaviruses are
                                              notorious for ADE
                                              reactions, where antibody
                                              presence potentiates the
                                              infection instead of
                                              protecting against it.
                                              Using that as a bioweapon
                                              is stupid because you will
                                              score "own goals" on your
                                              own people and there is no
                                              way to control that. As a
                                              result biological weapons
                                              generally are dumb; poison
                                              gas and such don't have
                                              this risk since it does
                                              not propagate but any
                                              disease does.<br>

                                              The poster child for ADE
                                              in coronaviruses was an
                                              attempted vaccine for a
                                              feline coronavirus that
                                              often made cats very sick.
                                              The vaccine killed every
                                              one of them in the test
                                              when they were later
                                              exposed, wildly
                                              potentiating the
                                              infection.<br>

                                              Read that again folks: NOT
                                              ONE VACCINATED CAT
                                              SURVIVED A CHALLENGE WITH
                                              THE ACTUAL VIRUS.<br>

                                              Ordinary vaccines we have
                                              lots of experience with,
                                              such as measles, the flu
                                              shot, mumps and similar do
                                              not carry a risk beyond
                                              that of natural infection
                                              and cannot be weaponized
                                              because they produce the
                                              exact same antibody
                                              response as a natural
                                              infection. If you have had
                                              either the measles or the
                                              shot you will have
                                              antibodies but an antibody
                                              test will not tell you
                                              which since they're not
                                              distinguishable.<br>
                                              <br>
                                              I suspected from the start
                                              that due to the way these
                                              mRNA shots work -- they
                                              are not actually a vaccine
                                              at all in that they do not
                                              "mimic" natural infection
                                              but rather cause your
                                              cells to produce the spike
                                              protein that the virus has
                                              and that elicits an immune
                                              response -- that the
                                              antibodies produced by
                                              those jabs would be
                                              distinct and
                                              distinguishable from
                                              natural infection.<br>

                                              develop these and the
                                              firms involved knew damn
                                              well this was the case
                                              when they started
                                              developing them -- and did

                                              The nightmare scenario
                                              that has always driven
                                              bioweapons research is the
                                              push to discover some
                                              genetically distinct means
                                              of targeting a bioweapon
                                              such that it only kills
                                              your adversary and leaves
                                              everyone else alone. It's
                                              even worse for your
                                              adversary if your side
                                              gets and transmits it but
                                              doesn't get sick. This has
                                              never been found despite
                                              diligent effort in the
                                              past; all attempts to find
                                              such a distinct
                                              vulnerability have failed,
                                              showing reactivity across
                                              the board and thus
                                              strongly suggesting that
                                              if that "thing" was
                                              completed and got out it
                                              would kill
                                              indiscriminately. That you
                                              cannot stop a virus from
                                              circulating (even isolated
                                              islands eventually got hit
                                              by the 1918 pandemic flu!)
                                              means that releasing a
                                              virus or bacteria that
                                              nobody on "your" side has
                                              been sensitized to yet
                                              doesn't help because when
                                              (not if) the sensitizing
                                              agent gets into your
                                              population all your people
                                              die too.<br>
                                              <br>
                                              This has now, for the
                                              first time in human
                                              history, been changed by
                                              the idiotic actions of our
                                              governments and
                                              pharmaceutical companies
                                              in that we are now tagging
                                              people for death by the
                                              literal millions and they
                                              will die if an adversary
                                              is able to develop a virus
                                              that targets those
                                              specific antibodies.<br>
                                              <br>
                                              Of course, said adversary
                                              will not deploy the
                                              tagging via said shots in
                                              their population and thus
                                              their people will not be
                                              attacked and killed. Since
                                              it takes an actual jab of
                                              a needle to be sensitized
                                              absent intentional action
                                              there is no risk to the
                                              adversary's population or
                                              troops.<br>

                                              I give the odds of an
                                              adversary (remember, we're
                                              talking nations here with

                                              and plenty of smart
                                              people) figuring out how
                                              to selectively target
                                              Covid-19 vaccination
                                              antibodies at 50% or
                                              better within the next

                                              single person who took one
                                              of the vaccines that
                                              produces a distinguishable

                                              You can bet your last
                                              nickel they're working on

                                              vaccinated our children
                                              and anyone who wishes to
                                              have a "normal" life back?
                                              The entire
                                              procreation-capable stock
                                              of people in the United
                                              States will die and so

                                              <br>
                                              That risk is wildly beyond
                                              the boundaries of sanity
                                              to have ever been accepted
                                              and it was deliberately
                                              concealed from the people
                                              -- not just here, but
                                              throughout the Western

                                              <br>
                                              It's clearly not enough
                                              for certain ghouls to have
                                              destroyed a full year of
                                              most school-age children's
                                              education; now they
                                              propose to risk literally
                                              extinguishing all of their
                                              lives and thus the future
                                              generations they would be
                                              able to create down the

                                              nation-states that would
                                              love to unleash something
                                              like this on those they
                                              hate, they will work on
                                              this problem and if they
                                              discover a way to exploit
                                              it they will do so.<br>

                                              The use of any "vaccine"
                                              that does not produce an

                                              we can eliminate the

                                              warned the FDA in December
                                              that mRNA vaccines could
                                              cause microvascular injury
                                              to the brain, heart, liver

                                              Specifically, Whelan was
                                              concerned that the new
                                              mRNA vaccine technology
                                              utilized by Pfizer and
                                              Moderna has “the potential
                                              to cause microvascular
                                              injury (inflammation and

                                              While Whelan did not
                                              dispute the vaccines’

                                              virus (assuming that the
                                              vaccines prove to actually
                                              prevent transmission —
                                              also not assessed in the

                                              cautioned that “it would
                                              be vastly worse if

                                              permanent damage to their

                                    corporate officials. Bürgermeister
                                    has documented how an international
                                    corporate criminal syndicate plans
                                    to unleash a deadly flu virus and

                                    “I am emerging from a long silence
                                    on the subject of vaccination,
                                    because I feel that, this time, the

                                    compulsory vaccination that will
                                    contain a deadly virus and this will
                                    be used specifically as a eugenics
                                    weapon for “massive and targeted
                                    reduction of the world population.”
                                    Moreover, a pandemic will also be
                                    used to further establish martial

                                    Lanctôt, and activate concentration
                                    camps “built to accommodate the
                                    rebellious” and eventually transfer

                                    Gibraltar is a British Colony at the
                                    southern tip of the Iberian
                                    Peninsula attached to the country of
                                    Spain. It’s population is just over
                                    30,000 people, and it is best known
                                    for its huge “rock,” the “Rock of

                                    <br>
                                    I have been contacted by residents
                                    in Gibraltar stating that 53 people
                                    have died in 10 days immediately
                                    following the roll out of injections
                                    of the Pfizer mRNA COVID injections,
                                    and calling it a “massacre.”<br>
                                    <br>
                                    Local media reports confirm the
                                    deaths, but blame them on COVID, and
                                    not the COVID injections.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    However, prior to the roll out of
                                    the injections, it is reported that
                                    only 16 people in total died “from
                                    COVID” since the beginning of the

                                    <b> </b>Fox News’ Steve Hilton
                                    shared an investigation that breaks
                                    down the origins of the coronavirus,
                                    and not only links it back to U.S.
                                    commissioned research, but also to
                                    Dr. Anthony Fauci.<br>
                                    The host of the “The Next
                                    Revolution” told his viewers that
                                    the evidence uncovered “points to
                                    the most likely cause of the
                                    pandemic and it’s worse than
                                    anything that we have heard so far.”<br>
                                    Highlighting a study 10 years ago in
                                    the Netherlands involving ferrets,
                                    which have respiratory systems that
                                    operate similar to humans, Hilton
                                    said researchers “were trying to see
                                    if the virus that starts out without
                                    the ability to be transmitted
                                    through the air can eventually gain
                                    that ability.”<br>
                                    “This led to the creation of an
                                    entirely new type of scientific
                                    research made possible by advances
                                    in gene technology,” he said. “It
                                    was called gain of function virus
                                    research. The idea was to replicate
                                    in a lab what had been done with
                                    those ferrets — to take the virus
                                    and manipulate the genetic code to
                                    make it stronger and powerful. The
                                    virus would gain new function, hence
                                    the name.”<br>
                                    The idea being to engineer the most
                                    contagious deadly viruses in lab
                                    conditions “to learn about
                                    treatments and vaccines about the
                                    calamity of an actual outbreak,”
                                    Hilton noted.<br>
                                    This research was carried out around
                                    the world, with Wuhan, China being
                                    home to a leading laboratory, funded
                                    in part by the National Institute of
                                    Allergy and Infectious Diseases,
                                    headed up by Dr. Anthony Fauci...<br>
                                    “Despite the controversy surrounding
                                    this type of research,” he said, “it
                                    always had one steadfast champion, a
                                    leading figure in the world of
                                    infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci.
                                    His institute funded that first
                                    ferret study. At the time he cowrote
                                    an op-ed in the Washington Post
                                    describing the research as “a risk
                                    worth taking… important information
                                    and insight can come from generating
                                    a potentially dangerous virus in the
                                    laboratory.”<br>
                                    “Shortly before the Obama
                                    Administration’s ban on gain of
                                    function research in 2014, Dr. Fauci
                                    commissioned … a project to assess
                                    the risk of new coronaviruses
                                    emerging from wild animals like bats
                                    — one of the aims was to see what
                                    viruses can infect animals and
                                    humans,” Hilton said.<br>
                                    The Fox News host said that while
                                    the Obama administration stopped the
                                    research, Fauci “continued on by
                                    subcontracting it” to the NY based
                                    EcoHealth Alliance.<br>
                                    Sharing what he called a “crucial
                                    step that have never been reported,”
                                    Hilton noted that EcoHealth Alliance
                                    then subcontracted the gain of
                                    function piece to the Wuhan
                                    Institute of Virology...<br>

                                    cause by a virus, despite popular
                                    belief, but was actually caused by
                                    poisoning from the pesticide DDT.
                                    Remember too that the cancer-causing
                                    monkey virus SV-40 (Simian Virus 40)
                                    was found in all polio vaccines
                                    administered to Americans up until
                                    around 1963. Young writes:<br>

                                    requires, for an epidemic to be a

                                    epidemic increase its incidence
                                    rates exponentially. Since polio has
                                    been ubiquitous since the beginning
                                    of human history, its incidence rate
                                    should have peaked long ago and
                                    universal immunity conferred, if
                                    immunity was ever required, and if
                                    the poliovirus was actually a

                                    and, intended or not, tantamount to
                                    yet another stab at mass murder. The
                                    panic about contracting this "fatal"
                                    infection has been grossly overblown
                                    with wild-eyed claims of 30 percent
                                    of Americans being infected, as
                                    claimed by the CDC. Yet only 10
                                    percent of the population carries
                                    the antibodies, which indicates a
                                    difference of 20 percent of the
                                    population, who therefore should
                                    therefore be dead by now, according
                                    to the CDC equation.<br>
                                    The unending official panic,besides
                                    being a Democrat ploy to steal the
                                    election, has led to another turn
                                    for the worse, which is to attach a
                                    detonator fuse, so to speak, to the
                                    COVID bomb. As discussed further on,
                                    the messenger RNA vaccine being
                                    pushed by Pfizer is frightening the
                                    human immune system into
                                    overreaction, thereby heightening
                                    the pain of once mild symptoms and,
                                    in some unreported cases, killing
                                    the unsuspecting patient.<br>
                                    As discussed extensively in this
                                    series, COVID-19 is a biological
                                    weapon spliced with gene sequences
                                    from HIV and bovine tuberculosis,
                                    which are both highly threatening to
                                    the human immune system.<br>
                                    The messaging RNA vaccine is being
                                    tested on nearly 2 million guinea
                                    pigs. At last count the vaxx has
                                    triggered, or to be precise
                                    rekindled adverse reactions in more
                                    than 4,000 healthy individuals (who
                                    probably had mild COVID infections
                                    earlier).<br>
                                    Covering the tracks of pharma
                                    Pfizer, the FDA's Center for
                                    Biologics Evaluation suggests that
                                    these painful reactions ranging from
                                    throbbing pain to life-threatening
                                    inflammation are due to its solvent
                                    polyethylene glycol (PEG)., which
                                    causes known side effects of
                                    bloating, diarrhea, nausea, cramps,
                                    gas and hives. That assessment is
                                    sheer nonsense, since patients
                                    undergoing bowel surgery are flushed
                                    and flooded with that substance as a
                                    tissue softener, whereas the
                                    intravenous dosage in the vaccine is
                                    minuscule by comparison. Any medical
                                    authority spouting such nonsense is
                                    guilty of premeditate diarrhea of
                                    the mouth.<br>
                                    That grease cannot possibly account
                                    for the recent death of a Florida
                                    physician, who showed the symptoms
                                    uncannily similar to COVID
                                    infections in children. These
                                    include heart palpitation, a low
                                    platelet county and small red spots
                                    on the skin, which are caused by
                                    ruptures of small blood vessels.
                                    Just two weeks after receiving the
                                    vaccine, the otherwise healthy 56
                                    year-old Miami Beach obstetrician
                                    died of a massive hemorrhagic stroke
                                    two<br>
                                    A majority of COVID vaccine
                                    sufferers have not had a prior
                                    history of allergenic reactions or
                                    anaphylaxis involving injections,
                                    which indicates something else is
                                    happening to their immune systems.
                                    What is happening in patients is
                                    toxic shock, the human immune system
                                    going berserk out of fear of viral
                                    invasion and shutting down the
                                    central nervous system. We are dying
                                    from existential fear of the
                                    invaders, so remember that old adage
                                    "we have met the enemy and it is
                                    us".<br>
                                    The Pfizer strategy is fundamentally
                                    wrong in mimicking the spike protein
                                    of the COVID antigen, which has the
                                    ability to tag the antibodies
                                    emitted from white blood corpuscles.
                                    People who have been mildly exposed
                                    to COVID will overreact to the
                                    presence of a spike protein. This is
                                    because the bovine tuberculosis
                                    strand attached to the COVID
                                    bioweapon has already "turned"
                                    antibodies into appearing to be
                                    attackers or antigens, to deceive
                                    the human immune system into the
                                    false perception of an all-out
                                    invasion, resulting in a panicked
                                    cytokyne storm that causes
                                    bio-system collapse in the patient.<br>
                                    In short, if you'd already had a
                                    mild brush with COVID, your immune
                                    system is likely to overreact to the
                                    monoclonal RNA vaccine. This
                                    explains the fever, bowel movement,
                                    palpitations and blood vessel
                                    ruptures as symptoms triggered by
                                    the vaccine inside a partially
                                    infected person, who otherwise
                                    should have survived COVID in good
                                    condition.<br>

                                    2003, is murderous criminality of
                                    the Democrat leadership, which
                                    evaded gain of function limits on
                                    biowar research, and the

                                    Pfizer disclaims responsibility,
                                    which is the green light for law

                                    mass hysteria, police state, and the
                                    government's inability to question

                                        last until 2028. According to
                                        the World Bank, COVID-19
                                        (SARS-CoV-2) is a “project” that

                                        was born and raised in the
                                        Soviet Union, and became a
                                        Military Doctor in St.
                                        Petersburg, Russia, and studied
                                        under the Strategic Rocket
                                        Force. He is an expert today on
                                        bio-weapons, Chemical,
                                        Biological, Radiological,

                                        preparedness. His view is that
                                        these vaccines are very similar
                                        technology to the bio-weapon RND
                                        used to develop viral weapons.
                                        He fully understands that the
                                        plan of depopulation and
                                        mandatory vaccinations will be
                                        at our doorstep very soon, and
                                        is shocked that the American
                                        people are so passive concerning
                                        this enemy takeover. He believes
                                        that this fake pandemic is the
                                        means by which a communist
                                        global government will be

                                    You see them everywhere. Men and
                                    women walking down the street, all
                                    of them with masks on their faces
                                    and cell phones in their hands.
                                    People jogging, with masks covering
                                    their faces and cell phones in their
                                    hands. Mothers wheeling their babies
                                    with one hand, holding a cell phone
                                    in the other hand, with a mask
                                    covering their face.<br>
                                    The world has gone insane.<br>
                                    Back in May, the President of
                                    Tanzania announced that a goat, a
                                    quail, and a papaya had tested
                                    positive for COVID-19. People did
                                    not stop eating papayas. But when
                                    farmed minks began testing positive,
                                    the response has been to kill them
                                    all.<br>
                                    After a few minks in the Netherlands
                                    tested positive in April, 570,000
                                    minks were slaughtered. Minks
                                    started testing positive and being
                                    killed in Denmark in June, and on
                                    November 4, Denmark announced it
                                    would destroy the rest of its 17
                                    million minks. Sanity finally broke
                                    out in that country, and the
                                    eradication campaign stopped after
                                    only 2.5 million minks were
                                    slaughtered. But minks have also
                                    been killed in Spain, Sweden,
                                    Greece, France, and the United
                                    States.<br>
                                    Lions, tigers and leopards in zoos
                                    have tested positive.<br>
                                    People have been testing their dogs
                                    and cats, and lo and behold, some of
                                    them have tested positive, and on
                                    May 6, the Centers for Disease
                                    Control created a webpage titled
                                    “What to Do if Your Pet Tests
                                    Positive for the Virus that Causes
                                    COVID-19.” This is what you are
                                    supposed to do: “Isolate the pet
                                    from everyone else, including other
                                    pets.” “Keep your pet at least 6
                                    feet away from other pets and
                                    people.” “If you have a private
                                    backyard where your dog can go to
                                    the bathroom, do not take them for
                                    walks.” But, the CDC warns, “Do not
                                    wipe or bathe your pet with… hand
                                    sanitizer,” and “Do not try to put a
                                    mask on your pet.”<br>
                                    It is becoming obvious that no
                                    matter what you test — minks, lions,
                                    dogs, papayas, people, or anything
                                    else — you will get positive
                                    results, and that the results mean
                                    nothing. Just wait until someone
                                    tests a cow. Kill all the cows, and
                                    no more meat or dairy products!
                                    Vaccinate every pet and farm animal
                                    in the world! Do contact tracing for
                                    every pet that comes in contact with
                                    an infected pet!<br>
                                    We have a pandemic, all right, but
                                    it is a pandemic of insanity, not
                                    COVID-19. The world — the entire
                                    world, not just a few people or a
                                    few countries or a few cultures —
                                    has forgotten what life is. Life is
                                    community. It is social contact,
                                    touching, breathing, sharing. It is
                                    oxygen. People are dying because
                                    their masks are making them hypoxic.
                                    Cancer cells thrive in the absence
                                    of oxygen. If you have cancer, and
                                    you wear a mask, you are making your
                                    cancer grow. And life is bacteria
                                    and viruses. Ninety-nine percent of
                                    all bacteria and viruses are
                                    beneficial and necessary — necessary
                                    for life, and necessary for
                                    evolution. If you disinfect the
                                    surface of the earth, you will put
                                    an end to life. We did not disinfect
                                    the world for smallpox, influenza,
                                    measles, or tuberculosis. But we are
                                    doing it for “COVID-19.”<br>
                                    And we are blaming every symptom
                                    known to man on “COVID-19.” COVID-19
                                    is a respiratory virus, closely
                                    related to the common cold. But we
                                    have made a caricature of it.
                                    Suddenly a coronavirus is a magical
                                    piece of RNA, created by Dracula,
                                    that will damage your kidneys or
                                    your heart or give you a stroke.<br>
                                    There is another, very real pandemic
                                    that is out of control: a pandemic
                                    of radiation. A pandemic that does
                                    cause kidney and heart damage and
                                    strokes, in addition to pneumonia.
                                    The radiation is produced by cell
                                    phones. The cell phones with which
                                    mothers are irradiating their
                                    babies, and joggers are irradiating
                                    their hearts. The cell phones with
                                    which 7 billion people are
                                    irradiating the birds, insects and
                                    flowers around them. The radiation
                                    that will kill all 7 billion of us,
                                    unless we put an end to it.<br>

                                  Despite the fact that a Federal judge
                                  in Pennsylvania ruled the shut downs
                                  were unconstitutional. The Michigan

                          population, and insisting that herd immunity

                      is 'not about vaccines or protecting people’s
                      lives—it is instead profoundly anti-science, and
                      is only focused on absolute [government] control
                      of every aspect of our lives.'<br>
                      There has been a massive flood of contradictory
                      and false information being published about the
                      Wuhan virus and the various vaccines that have
                      recently been approved that allegedly prevent
                      infection. And there has been a massive
                      disinformation campaign against several already
                      available, safe, effective, and very inexpensive
                      preventative and “miracle” treatment medications
                      for Wuhan infection.<br>
                      Thankfully, thousands of ethical physicians,
                      scientists, and others are now actively attempting
                      to counter the flood of lies and extremely flawed
                      narratives related to these issues, including,<br>
                      - false justifications for a now huge increase
                      again in catastrophic, medically and
                      scientifically unnecessary lockdowns<br>
                      - intense pressure to accept vaccination with the
                      poorly tested, dangerous and never-before-tried
                      mRNA vaccines<br>
                      - what may likely be an inevitable, devastating
                      loss of fundamental rights and freedoms for those
                      who refuse to be vaccinated<br>
                      - partly because it is impossible to give fully
                      informed consent to such vaccination because there
                      is inadequate, trustworthy information about its
                      safety and effectiveness.<br>
                      This has never before happened in history,
                      especially for a virus that is now known to be
                      less dangerous than the common flu, except for
                      those over 70 with certain health issues. And even
                      that category of persons has a very high recovery
                      rate if they receive proper early treatment.<br>
                      First off, I would encourage you to review my
                      updated, in-depth, December 10 investigative
                      report on 10 actions Trump must take to save us
                      from impending globalist tyranny. It is a long
                      read, but anyone I have talked to who has made the
                      effort to read the document, view the videos, and
                      investigate the links has expressed immense
                      gratitude for having their eyes opened to many
                      aspects about the virus that they had no idea
                      about and which none of the mainstream media have
                      reported.<br>
                      Patrick Delaney’s explosive December 17 report,
                      What is the real motivation for attempting to
                      vaccinate millions of healthy people?, has also
                      been updated with some amazing additional videos
                      and information to help readers further explore
                      what might be behind the disturbing,
                      world-changing developments related to the Wuhan
                      virus.<br>
                      The added excerpt from a Children’s Health Defense
                      video regarding the safety of the COVID-19 and all
                      other vaccines is a goldmine of calmly presented
                      questions and facts that I am sure will be greatly
                      appreciated by most who view it.<br>
                      Both mine and Delaney’s articles and the video
                      below will really help you to understand why
                      Senator Ted Cruz stated the following about the
                      health tyranny that we have all been subjected to
                      the past several months:<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “This is a bizarre, lunatic,
                      totalitarian cult.<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s not about vaccines or
                      protecting people’s lives—it is instead profoundly
                      anti-science, and is only focused on absolute govt
                      control of every aspect of our lives.”<br>
                      Following is an especially MUST-VIEW, recent
                      presentation by Robert Kennedy, Jr. of Children’s
                      Health Defense. Kennedy’s Message for Freedom and
                      Hope provides a powerful, motivating overview of
                      the “coup d’etat” by powerful international forces
                      whom Kennedy claims “want to subvert our
                      democracies and want to destroy our sovereignty
                      and our control over our lives and our children’s
                      health.”<br>
                      He begins with by stating that his message is
                      being presented<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; …to thousands of citizens, in
                      15 countries on all the continents in the world,
                      who have come together today to protest this coup
                      d’etat —&nbsp; by Big Data, by Big Telecom, by Big
                      Tech, by the big oil and chemical companies,&nbsp;
                      and by this global public health cartel led by
                      Bill Gates and the W.H.O — and now amounts to two
                      trillion dollars and wants to magnify and amplify
                      its wealth and its power over our lives, over our
                      liberties.<br>
                      Kennedy asks a lot of questions in this video that
                      we may not have thought of, but should all be
                      asking. He stresses the great importance of
                      honest, open debate on the issues of our day and
                      the free flow of information, as opposed to the
                      massive censoring of certain views that we are
                      currently enduring.<br>
                      He urges everyone to participate in the exchange
                      of information and free debate and tells all of
                      his viewers,<br>
                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are on the front lines of
                      the most important battle in history and it is the
                      battle to save democracy, and freedom, and human
                      liberty, and human dignity from this totalitarian
                      cartel that is trying to rob us – simultaneously
                      in every nation in the world — of the rights that
                      every human being is born with.<br>
                      The founder of Children’s Health Defense ends by
                      announcing that Children’s Health Defense is
                      launching a daily information journal to help to
                      generate that flow of information and debate.<br>
                      Those are just a few, brief excerpts of statements
                      in the video. I don’t want to post more because it
                      is more important that you watch this great man,
                      who makes it plain that he is willing to give his
                      life for the truth.<br>
                      Such leadership is a rarity in our
                      great-leader-deprived current world. By watching
                      his presentation, you will most effectively absorb
                      his necessary message to the people of the world.
                      Everyone needs to hear this inspiring oration at
                      this critical time in history...<br>

                          pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus
                          SARS-CoV-2 has led to over 910,000 deaths
                          worldwide and unprecedented decimation of the
                          global economy. Despite its tremendous impact,
                          the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has remained
                          mysterious and controversial. The natural
                          origin theory, although widely accepted, lacks
                          substantial support. The alternative theory
                          that the virus may have come from a research
                          laboratory is, however, strictly censored on
                          peer-reviewed scientific journals.
                          Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 shows biological
                          characteristics that are inconsistent with a
                          naturally occurring, zoonotic virus. In this
                          report, we describe the genomic, structural,
                          medical, and literature evidence, which, when
                          considered together, strongly contradicts the
                          natural origin theory. The evidence shows that
                          SARS-CoV-2 should be a laboratory product
                          created by using bat coronaviruses ZC45 and/or
                          ZXC21 as a template and/or backbone. Building
                          upon the evidence, we further postulate a
                          synthetic route for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating
                          that the laboratory-creation of this
                          coronavirus is convenient and can be
                          accomplished in approximately six months. Our
                          work emphasizes the need for an independent
                          investigation into the relevant research
                          laboratories. It also argues for a critical
                          look into certain recently published data,
                          which, albeit problematic, was used to support
                          and claim a natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. From
                          a public health perspective, these actions are
                          necessary as knowledge of the origin of
                          SARS-CoV-2 and of how the virus entered the
                          human population are of pivotal importance in
                          the fundamental control of the COVID-19
                          pandemic as well as in preventing similar,

                          President Peter Daszak drafted The Lancet

                          hundreds of CCP members. Additionally, Pfizer

                          CCP loyalists routinely steal corporate
                          secrets and compromise the security and
                          integrity of corporations that might compete
                          against Chinese interests. Also according to
                          the UK Daily Mail, “there were more than 600
                          party members across 19 branches working at
                          the British banks HSBC and Standard Chartered

                          <br>
                          The CCP created the coronavirus bioweapon, and
                          we believe that the CCP used its spies to
                          infiltrate and compromise vaccine
                          manufacturers in order to turn coronavirus
                          vaccines into “second wave” bioweapons that
                          will injure or kill very large numbers of
                          people who take the vaccines.<br>
                          <br>
                          This also means that individuals who are
                          pushing vaccine mandates are playing right
                          into the hands of communist China — which has
                          sworn to destroy the United States of America
                          through “unrestricted warfare” — and are
                          themselves engaged in acts of criminal treason
                          against the United States.<br>
                          How many CCP loyalists work in Big Tech?<br>
                          <br>
                          So far, only 8,192 names have been publicly
                          released of the nearly 2 million CCP loyalists
                          whose names are on the full list. We have not
                          yet seen how many CCP loyalists are working
                          with the tech giants such as Google, Facebook,
                          YouTube and Twitter. However, we already know
                          that Facebook deliberately hired communist
                          Chinese software experts to design its “hate
                          speech engineering” algorithm that censors
                          U.S. citizens who defend the Constitution or
                          President Trump.<br>

                          In other words, Big Tech deliberately recruits
                          communist Chinese to build more advanced
                          censorship algorithms to censor Americans, and
                          then Big Tech deploys these algorithms to bury
                          all evidence of election theft that was also
                          carried out via China-owned Dominion Voting
                          Systems. What we are describing here is a
                          massive, international criminal conspiracy to
                          overthrow the United States of America.<br>
                          <br>
                          This is why all the CEOs of Big Tech must face
                          arrest, prosecution and public executions if
                          found guilty of treason.<br>

                          From the UK Daily Mail:<br>
                          <br>
                          Writing in The Mail on Sunday today, former
                          Tory Party leader Iain Duncan Smith says:
                          ‘This investigation proves that members of the
                          Chinese Communist Party are now spread around
                          the globe, with members working for some of
                          the world’s most important multinational
                          corporations, academic institutions and our
                          own diplomatic services.<br>
                          <br>
                          Communist China, in other words, has
                          infiltrated Western nations, corporations and
                          governments. The hour is already late.
                          Communist China also owns Dominion Voting
                          Systems and used the rigged systems to
                          recently try to steal the U.S. election and
                          install their puppet candidate (Joe Biden) as
                          the U.S. President.<br>
                          <br>
                          The entire Biden crime family is deeply
                          compromised by communist China, and CCP
                          loyalists have also successfully infiltrated
                          Airbus, Boeing and Rolls-Royce.<br>
                          <br>
                          Now the software “glitch” about the Boeing
                          737-Max makes more sense, doesn’t it?<br>
                          <br>
                          Don’t forget, either, that Joe Biden held
                          priority meetings with the very same vaccine
                          makers who have been infiltrated by the CCP.
                          What do you suppose they discussed?<br>
                          US Army General Perna announces “Vaccine
                          D-Day,” using CCP-influenced vaccines to
                          declare, “the beginning of the end” for
                          America<br>
                          <br>
                          Suddenly Operation Warp Speed makes even more
                          sense. US Army Gen. Perna and former Defense
                          Secretary Mark Esper chose China-connected
                          vaccine companies to supply millions of
                          vaccine doses that would be administered to
                          harm U.S. military personnel. As we have
                          previously covered in daily Situation Update
                          podcasts, one of the groups being targeted for
                          these priority vaccines is cyber warfare
                          soldiers.<br>
                          <br>
                          Gen. Perna has publicly declared that vaccines
                          will be rolled out across the military as a
                          “Vaccine D-Day,” further claiming the vaccines
                          will be “the beginning of the end” for
                          America. This makes perfect sense when you
                          consider how these black hat operators in the
                          DoD are already aligned with China and have
                          been exploited to distribute a dangerous, even
                          deadly vaccines manufactured by corporations
                          with ties to communist China. (The DoD is
                          split. There are anti-America, pro-China
                          “black hat” forces inside the DoD, but also
                          pro-America, pro-Trump “white hat” forces. A
                          civil war is under way in the Pentagon…)<br>
                          <br>
                          China has long had a goal of the complete
                          destruction of the United States of America,
                          and the CCP can’t accomplish that goal unless
                          they can first cause widespread casualties and
                          deaths among military personnel, after which a
                          land invasion via Canada will be much easier
                          to accomplish.<br>
                          <br>
                          As bombshell documents released in the last
                          two days have stunningly revealed, Canada’s
                          treasonous prime minister Justin Trudeau
                          allowed Canada’s military to help train
                          communist Chinese soldiers in winter warfare
                          tactics, all in preparation for a land
                          invasion of the United States. This places
                          Trudeau in the “enemy combatant” category, and
                          as I will be covering in tomorrow’s Situation
                          Update, President Trump is preparing to drop
                          huge economic and trade sanctions on Canada in
                          response to Canada’s betrayal.<br>
                          <br>
                          See this important interview with JR Nyquist
                          to understand China’s grand plan to destroy
                          the United States, invade North America and
                          conquer the continent through the mass
                          extermination of all who oppose them:<br>
                          <br>
                          Thus, China’s infiltration of the vaccine
                          manufacturers was necessary to cause mass
                          casualties across US troops, while Canada’s
                          prime minister would allow China to use Canada
                          as an invasion staging area to threaten the
                          United States from the North. With Big Tech
                          and Big Media also completely controlled by
                          communist China, no American would be allowed
                          to speak about the invasion taking place, and
                          those who posted videos or photos of the
                          wartime invasions would, of course, be
                          blacklisted and deplatformed.<br>
                          <br>
                          China’s “total war” on America is now fully
                          revealed<br>
                          <br>
                          The truth is now obvious: China planned a
                          multi-faceted assault on America using rigged
                          voting machines, toxic vaccines, land invasion
                          plans and corporate infiltration, all while
                          controlling tech and media in order to
                          completely overthrow the United States of
                          America and claim North America for the CCP.<br>
                          <br>
                          As I have stated in today’s Situation Update,
                          we are now living in an active war zone, while
                          China-controlled Democrat governors have taken
                          millions of Americans prisoner, turning them
                          into POWs in their own homes, via weaponized
                          covid-19 lockdowns that make no scientific or
                          medical sense whatsoever.<br>
                          <br>
                          These are acts of war against the American
                          people, and the Democrats are almost
                          universally corrupted and compromised by
                          communist China.<br>
                          <br>
                          This is why I repeat my call to arrest,
                          prosecute and execute all treasonous Americans
                          who are proven to be working for communist
                          China to undermine the United States of
                          America.<br>
                          <br>
                          President Trump appears to be on the verge of
                          invoking the Insurrection Act and deploying
                          Special Operations Forces (SOF) to carry out
                          mass arrests of treasonous operatives across
                          America. Military tribunals are probably not
                          far behind, and here’s what Gen. Michael Flynn
                          said just today (via Maria Bartiromo / Fox
                          Business):<br>
                          <br>
                          Sidney Powell right now has four lawsuits
                          pending at the Supreme Court… we have
                          conclusive evidence of foreign interference in
                          our election… , I think that the President of
                          the United States has to trigger his executive
                          order of 2018, and probably appoint a special
                          counsel to look into all this… because we have
                          serious, serious foreign influence problems
                          with this Dominion voting machine.<br>
                          <br>
                          And Sidney Powell added to the intrigue in a
                          recent interview with Lou Dobbs, saying:<br>
                          <br>
                          We know that 400 million dollars of money came
                          into Smartmatic from China only a few weeks
                          before the election, that there are George
                          Soros connections to the entire endeavor…
                          Frankly, our national security agency and
                          defense intelligence agency need to be all
                          over this immediately. The evidence is
                          overwhelming and extremely troubling that this
                          has been going on and didn’t just start this
                          year.<br>

                      CDS is a concentrated aqueous solution of 0,3%
                      (3000ppm) of chlorine dioxide gas, with no sodium
                      chlorite (NaClO2) content in the solution and has
                      a neutral pH. <br>
                      10ml is diluted with 1 liter of water obtaining
                      0,003% (30ppm) in 10 shots of 100ml every hour as
                      a daily dose. (= 3mg ClO2 per dose)<br>
                      What is MMS?<br>
                      MMS is the mixture of sodium chlorite (NaClO2)
                      activated with citric acid that contains sodium
                      chlorite and is of acidic pH. MMS It is the name
                      Jim Humble gave to the mixture of sodium chlorite
                      (NaClO2) activated with citric acid at the time.
                      It works excellent for many illnesses, but there
                      is a stomach reaction and it can cause diarrhea as
                      a side effect and its taste is unpleasant for
                      many. It is the basis for manufacturing CDS <br>
                      What is CD?<br>
                      CD is a more advanced form of MMS. It is the
                      mixture of sodium chlorite (NaClO2) activated with
                      hydrochloric acid that contains sodium chlorite
                      and has an acidic pH. It is better in taste and
                      can be useful for its easy transport but it has a
                      secondary stomach reaction. It is the basis for

                      Chlorine dioxide is just the gas from the reaction
                      of sodium chlorite (NaClO2) activated with an

                      driving public hysteria, and all testing should
                      stop.<br>
                      <br>
                      “All that should be done is to protect the

                      <br>
                      “And I would remind you all that using the

                      death under 65 is 1 in 300,000. You’ve got to get
                      a grip on this. The scale of the response … with
                      no evidence for it, is utterly ridiculous.<br>
                      <br>
                      “Suicides, business closures, [cancelled]

                      <br>
                      Hodkison concludes with some advice for policy
                      makers in Alberta: “Let people make their own
                      decisions. You should be totally out of the
                      business of medicine. You’re being led down the
                      garden path by the chief medical officer of health
                      in this province. I’m absolutely outraged that
                      this has reached this level. It should all stop

                      all this talk of asymptomatic carriers has been

                      <b>Abstract<br>
                      </b>We performed a retrospective analysis spanning
                      ten years of pediatric practice focused on
                      patients with variable vaccination born into a
                      practice, presenting a unique opportunity to study
                      the effects of variable vaccination on outcomes.
                      The average total incidence of billed office
                      visits per outcome related to the outcomes were
                      compared across groups (Relative Incidence of
                      Office Visit (RIOV)). RIOV is shown to be more
                      powerful than odds ratio of diagnoses. Full
                      cohort, cumulative incidence analyses, matched for
                      days of care, and matched for family history
                      analyses were conducted across quantiles of
                      vaccine uptake. Increased office visits related to
                      many diagnoses were robust to days-of-care-matched
                      analyses, family history, gender block, age block,
                      and false discovery risk. Many outcomes had high
                      RIOV odds ratios after matching for days-of-care
                      (e.g., anemia (6.334), asthma (3.496), allergic
                      rhinitis (6.479), and sinusitis (3.529), all
                      significant under the Z-test). Developmental
                      disorders were determined to be difficult to study
                      due to extremely low prevalence in the practice,
                      potentially attributable to high rates of vaccine
                      cessation upon adverse events and family history
                      of autoimmunity. Remarkably, zero of the 561
                      unvaccinated patients in the study had attention
                      deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) compared to
                      0.063% of the (partially and fully) vaccinated.
                      The implications of these results for the net
                      public health effects of whole-population
                      vaccination and with respect for informed consent
                      on human health are compelling. Our results give
                      agency to calls for research conducted by
                      individuals who are independent of any funding
                      sources related to the vaccine industry. While the
                      low rates of developmental disorders prevented
                      sufficiently powered hypothesis testing, it is
                      notable that the overall rate of autism spectrum
                      disorder (0.84%) in the cohort is half that of the
                      US national rate (1.69%). The practice-wide rate
                      of ADHD was roughly half of the national rate. The
                      data indicate that unvaccinated children in the
                      practice are not unhealthier than the vaccinated
                      and indeed the overall results may indicate that
                      the unvaccinated pediatric patients in this
                      practice are healthier overall than the
                      vaccinated. <br>

                      </b>The doctors concur that Pfizer’s vaccine
                      studies should be halted until a credible study
                      design can be presented, one that doesn’t falsify
                      data endpoints and one that addresses a host of
                      serious safety concerns. The doctors warn that
                      Pfizer is conflating non-specific symptoms of
                      illness with COVID-19 diagnoses for the control
                      arm while using inaccurate, high cycle PCR tests
                      for a diagnosis. The doctors warn that the
                      vaccine’s efficacy is being contorted because the
                      study design fails to properly diagnose cases of
                      COVID-19 and fails to confirm infection using the
                      Sanger sequencing method. They conclude that risk
                      of disease and potential vaccine benefit cannot be
                      measured or determined with accuracy. They demand
                      a halt to all human experimentation with these
                      mRNA injections.<br>

                      all of us in every possible way. Dr Coleman also
                      explains why maks are now creating an epidemic of
                      bacterial pneumonia, and he explains why the
                      British Government's advice means that he believes
                      that no one has to wear a mask.<br>

                          <font size="+1">The global coronavirus disease
                            2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe
                            acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
                            (SARS-CoV-2), has led to unprecedented
                            social and economic consequences. The risk
                            of morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19
                            increases dramatically in the presence of
                            coexisting medical conditions, while the
                            underlying mechanisms remain unclear.
                            Furthermore, there are no approved therapies
                            for COVID-19. This study aims to identify
                            SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, disease
                            manifestations, and COVID-19 therapies using
                            network medicine methodologies along with
                            clinical and multi-omics observations. We
                            incorporate SARS-CoV-2 virus–host
                            protein–protein interactions,
                            transcriptomics, and proteomics into the
                            human interactome. Network proximity
                            measurement revealed underlying pathogenesis
                            for broad COVID-19-associated disease
                            manifestations. Analyses of single-cell RNA
                            sequencing data show that co-expression of
                            ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is elevated in absorptive
                            enterocytes from the inflamed ileal tissues
                            of Crohn disease patients compared to
                            uninflamed tissues, revealing shared
                            pathobiology between COVID-19 and
                            inflammatory bowel disease. Integrative
                            analyses of metabolomics and transcriptomics
                            (bulk and single-cell) data from asthma
                            patients indicate that COVID-19 shares an
                            intermediate inflammatory molecular profile
                            with asthma (including IRAK3 and ADRB2). To
                            prioritize potential treatments, we combined
                            network-based prediction and a propensity
                            score (PS) matching observational study of
                            26,779 individuals from a COVID-19 registry.
                            We identified that melatonin usage (odds
                            ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.91) is
                            significantly associated with a 28% reduced
                            likelihood of a positive laboratory test
                            result for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed by reverse
                            transcription–polymerase chain reaction
                            assay. Using a PS matching user active
                            comparator design, we determined that
                            melatonin usage was associated with a
                            reduced likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 positive
                            test result compared to use of angiotensin
                            II receptor blockers (OR = 0.70, 95% CI
                            0.54–0.92) or angiotensin-converting enzyme
                            inhibitors (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.52–0.90).
                            Importantly, melatonin usage (OR = 0.48, 95%
                            CI 0.31–0.75) is associated with a 52%
                            reduced likelihood of a positive laboratory
                            test result for SARS-CoV-2 in African
                            Americans after adjusting for age, sex,
                            race, smoking history, and various disease
                            comorbidities using PS matching. In summary,
                            this study presents an integrative network
                            medicine platform for predicting disease
                            manifestations associated with COVID-19 and
                            identifying melatonin for potential
                            prevention and treatment of COVID-19.</font><br>

                      Vaccine Syndrome is a film produced by Oscar
                      nominated filmmaker Scott Miller, and provides
                      exclusive interviews with military personnel who
                      have had experience with the controversial anthrax
                      vaccine.<br>
                      The film claims that over 35,000 soldiers have
                      died from the anthrax vaccine, according to a
                      “RAC-GWVI Government Report” published in 2008.<br>
                      Compare that to how many soldiers have died in
                      combat in both Iraq and Afghanistan, which is 6753
                      at the time of the filming.<br>
                      The film starts out with a dramatized recreating
                      of Lance Corporal Jared Schwartz, who refused to
                      receive the anthrax vaccine.<br>
                      He had to face a military tribunal without legal
                      counsel, and read a prepared statement.<br>
                      That statement can be found online, such as at the
                      GulfWarVets.com website.<br>
                      The film also mentions how pharmaceutical
                      companies have legal immunity from any injuries or
                      deaths resulting from vaccines, and that the
                      civilian population only has recourse to sue the
                      federal government in a special Vaccine Court.<br>

                  This document presents considerations from the
                  perspective of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
                  &amp; Prevention (CDC) for implementing the shielding
                  approach in humanitarian settings as outlined in
                  guidance documents focused on camps, displaced
                  populations and low-resource settings...<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>What is the Shielding Approach1?</b><br>
                  The shielding approach aims to reduce the number of
                  severe COVID-19 cases by limiting contact between
                  individuals at higher risk of developing severe
                  disease (“high-risk”) and the general population
                  (“low-risk”). High-risk individuals would be
                  temporarily relocated to safe or “green zones”
                  established at the household, neighborhood,
                  camp/sector or community level depending on the
                  context and setting.1,2 They would have minimal
                  contact with family members and other low-risk
                  residents..<br>

                  War has broken out in the scientific literature that
                  strikes at the existential core of Covid-19 and its
                  proposed causative virus.<br>
                  <br>
                  At the heart of the controversy lies the fact that the
                  creators of the most commonly used test, the RT-PCR,
                  published instructions for how to test for SARS-CoV-2
                  “without having virus material available,” in their
                  own words, relying instead on the Chinese scientists’
                  genetic sequence published on the internet.<br>
                  <br>
                  The paper “Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus
                  (2019-nCoV) by real-time PCR” was published 24 hours
                  after it was submitted to Eurosurveillance, clearly
                  evading peer review. Its lead authors were Christian
                  Drosten and Victor Corman, which is how it took on the
                  title&nbsp; “Corman-Drosten paper.” It provided the
                  “recipe,” or work flow for the Covid-19 diagnostic
                  test, quickly applied all over the world, after it was
                  accepted as the standard of testing by the WHO.<br>
                  <br>
                  German scientist Christian Drosten was also a
                  co-discoverer of the SARS-associated coronavirus, and
                  developed a test for it in 2003. Drosten, who heads
                  the Charite Institute of Virology in Berlin, and a
                  team of fellow scientists in Europe and Hong Kong,
                  moved very quickly, as soon as cases of the illness
                  were being reported out of Wuhan in December of 2019.
                  They submitted the paper on Jan. 21, it was published
                  in Eurosurveillance on Jan. 23,* and was immediately
                  accepted as the standard of testing internationally,
                  by the WHO, which began sending test kits to affected
                  regions. (Fact check: was it 24 hours? Corbett says
                  yes.)<br>
                  <br>
                  In the harrowing months that followed, amid lockdowns,
                  economic collapse, school closures and widespread
                  panic, few were aware of the immense problems with the
                  paper, which tragically offered a testing method that
                  would yield between 80 and 97 percent false positive
                  results, due to a non existent gold standard which
                  would be the virus itself.<br>
                  <br>
                  It all came to a head on Nov. 30, when the
                  Corman-Drosten foundation paper was challenged by 22
                  international scientists who wrote a letter demanding
                  the paper’s retraction, along with an extensive
                  critique citing 10 errors in the paper it deemed
                  “fatal.”<br>
                  <br>

                  detect SARS-Cov-2 Reveals 10 Major Flaws At The
                  Molecular and Methodological Level: Consequences For
                  False-Positive Results,” the paper’s lead author is
                  Dr. Pieter Borger, an expert on the molecular biology
                  of gene expression. Several other esteemed names are
                  associated with the paper including Dr. Michael
                  Yeadon, former VP of Pfizer and outspoken critic of
                  much of the so-called science beneath the WHO’s global
                  lockdown, masking, and school shut-down measures.<br>
                  <br>
                  I reached one of the authors, Dr. Kevin Corbett, at
                  his home in London. He spoke simply&nbsp; and with
                  controlled apoplexy. He confirmed and cast additional
                  light on the shocking fact that the paper was written
                  in the absence of a viral isolate, among many other
                  problems.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Every scientific rationale for the development of
                  that test has been totally destroyed by this paper.
                  It’s like Hiroshima/Nagasaki to the Covid test,” he
                  said. “When Drosten developed the test, China hadn’t
                  given them a viral isolate. They developed the test
                  from a sequence in a gene bank. Do you see? China gave
                  them a genetic sequence with no corresponding viral
                  isolate. They had a code, but no body for the code. No
                  viral morphology.”<br>
                  <br>
                  I asked him to define “viral morphology” for the
                  layperson.<br>
                  <br>
                  “In the fish market,” he said, “it’s like giving you a
                  few bones and saying that’s your fish. It could be any
                  fish. Not even a skeleton. Here’s a few fragments of
                  bones. That’s your fish. Listen, the Corman/Drosten
                  paper, there’s nothing from a patient in it. It’s all
                  from gene banks. and the bits of the virus sequence
                  that weren’t there they made up. They synthetically
                  created them to fill in the blanks. That’s what
                  genetics is; it’s a code. So its ABBBCCDDD and you’re
                  missing some what you think is EEE so you put it in.
                  It’s all synthetic. You just manufacture the bits that
                  are missing. This is the end result of the
                  geneticization of virology. This is basically a
                  computer virus.“<br>
                  <br>
                  In an interview posted on his Twitter feed, Dr. Pieter
                  Borger said,”The virus wasn’t in Europe and the paper
                  was already finished.”&nbsp; He said these facts
                  “should have been on television long ago. I explained
                  it on LinkedIn, but you get banned if you do.
                  Regarding PCR he said, “You are not detecting a
                  virus.”<br>
                  <br>
                  “Once I heard a good comparison,” he continued. “If
                  you go to a junkyard and you find a wheel or a hubcap
                  from a Mercedes, and a steering wheel of a Mercedes,
                  can you infer that you are in a Mercedes garage at
                  that moment? If you only see those two parts? No, you
                  can’t. You don’t know anything about it . . . you only
                  know you have a steering wheel, you can find those
                  things everywhere. In every junkyard you can find
                  them.” He describes the RT PCT tests as having “no
                  relevance for the diagnosis whatsoever.”<br>
                  <br>
                  German lawyer Reiner Fuellmich who is central to a
                  growing group of lawyers, scientists, politicians, and
                  even secret pharmaceutical whistleblowers, said in an
                  interview, “We believe that in order to make this
                  house of cards collapse, we have to attack the PCR
                  test. The fact is, there are no asymptomatic
                  infections.”<br>
                  <br>
                  This seemingly radical claim was bolstered by a paper
                  out of Wuhan of all places, published by Nature.com,
                  which found no “viable virus” in PCR positive cases.<br>
                  <br>
                  “The screening of the 9,865,404 participants without a
                  history of COVID-19 found no newly confirmed COVID-19
                  cases, and identified 300 asymptomatic positive cases
                  with a detection rate of 0.303 (95 % CI
                  0.270–0.339)/10,000. … A total of 1174 close contacts
                  of the asymptomatic positive cases were traced, and
                  they all tested negative for the COVID-19. … Of the
                  34,424 participants with a history of COVID-19, 107
                  tested positive again, giving a repositive rate of
                  0.310% (95% CI 0.423–0.574%.) Virus cultures were
                  negative for all asymptomatic positive and repositive
                  cases, indicating no “viable virus” in positive cases
                  detected in this study.”<br>
                  Dr. Kevin Corbett, Ph.D./Photo: Twitter<br>
                  <br>
                  Dr. Corbett, a Ph.D., and retired RN elaborated:
                  “There are 10 fatal errors in this Drosten test paper.
                  Public Health England is a co-author on it. All the
                  public health authorities across the EU have
                  co-authored this paper. But here is the bottom line:
                  There was no viral isolate to validate what they were
                  doing. The PCR products of the amplification didn’t
                  correspond to any viral isolate at that time. I call
                  it ‘donut ring science.’ There is nothing at the
                  center of it. It’s all about code, genetics, nothing
                  to do with reality, or the actual person, the
                  patient.”<br>
                  <br>
                  I read him some of the critiques from the other side,
                  that say it’s been isolated “all over the world.”<br>
                  <br>
                  “Yes, there have since papers saying they’ve produced
                  viral isolates. But there are no controls for them.
                  The CDC produced a paper in July, I think it was,
                  where they said: ‘Here’s the viral isolate.’ Do you
                  know what they did? They swabbed one person. One
                  person, who’d been to China and had cold symptoms. One
                  person. And they assumed he had it to begin with. So
                  it’s all full of holes, the whole thing.”<br>
                  <br>
                  One of their 10 challenges is the stunning fact that
                  EuroSurveillance published the paper 24 hours after it
                  was submitted back in January. “Twenty-four hours,”
                  Dr. Corbett said incredulously. “That never happens.
                  It takes months to get a review done. They turned this
                  around in 24 hours. It was waved through, it was not
                  peer-reviewed. There’s no standard operational
                  procedure for this test. There’s major and minor
                  concerns about this paper and we go through it all
                  here. it should be retracted. If they retract it, it
                  means the whole thing falls to bits. The whole edifice
                  collapses. It’s a house of cards built on sand and
                  we’ve just moved the sand.”...<br>

                  Reiner Fuellmich,1 who has been a consumer protection
                  trial lawyer in California and Germany2 for 26 years,
                  is a founding member of the German Corona
                  Extra-Parliamentary Inquiry Committee
                  (Außerparlamentarischer Corona
                  Untersuchungsausschuss,3 or ACU),4,5 launched July 10,
                  2020.<br>
                  <br>
                  Fuellmich is leading the committee's corona crisis
                  tort case — an international class-action lawsuit that
                  will be filed against those responsible for using
                  fraudulent testing to engineer the appearance of a
                  dangerous pandemic in order to implement economically
                  devastating lockdowns around the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  He estimates more than 50 other countries will be
                  following suit. In the video above, Patrick Bet-David
                  interviews Fuellmich about how and why the group was
                  formed and the status of this work.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>The Backstory</b><br>
                  <b> </b>Early on, as Fuellmich started hearing
                  concerns from family and friends in Germany about a
                  new respiratory virus, one particular name kept
                  popping up: professor Christian Drosten, Ph.D., a
                  German virologist.<br>
                  <br>
                  As head of the Institute of Virology at the University
                  of Bonn Medical Centre, Drosten is best known for
                  developing the first diagnostic test for SARS in 2003.
                  He also developed a diagnostic test for the swine
                  flu,6 and in 2009 helped drum up panic with doomsday
                  prophesies about H1N1.<br>
                  <br>
                  When COVID-19 initially emerged in early 2020, Drosten
                  kept saying there was no cause for concern. Then,
                  seemingly overnight, he changed his tune, "as though
                  someone had given him a signal." All of a sudden,
                  Drosten was saying that this virus was extremely
                  dangerous and that drastic measures to contain it had
                  to be implemented.<br>
                  <br>
                  Based on whistleblower testimony, the German
                  government relied on the opinion of Drosten alone when
                  deciding on their pandemic response, which included
                  the lockdown of healthy citizens and the suspension of
                  constitutional rights for an indefinite period of
                  time.<br>
                  <br>
                  Interestingly, Fuellmich's team recently discovered
                  that Drosten's Ph.D. dissertation is a fraud. It was
                  only created this year when people began investigating
                  his background.<br>
                  <br>
                  Aside from Drosten, other individuals who have
                  prominent roles include Lothar H. Wieler, the head of
                  the German equivalent of the Centers for Disease
                  Control and Prevention, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
                  head of the World Health Organization and Neil
                  Ferguson of the Imperial College of London.<br>
                  <br>
                  Unsure of what was going on, Fuellmich contacted an
                  old friend, Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg, a former member of
                  the German Congress and the Council of Europe. Wodarg
                  urged him to investigate and suggested some names of
                  experts to look into, such as professor John Ioannidis
                  at Stanford University and professor and Nobel Prize
                  winner Michael Levitt.<br>
                  <br>
                  The more he investigated the facts available, the more
                  Fuellmich realized COVID-19 was being grossly
                  oversold. Eventually, he started making inquiries to
                  see if there were any other lawyers out there raising
                  questions about the legality of the pandemic and the
                  global response to it.<br>
                  <br>
                  He discovered that Beate Bahner, an attorney
                  specializing in medical law, had in fact spoken out,
                  arguing that Germany's quarantine measures were
                  unconstitutional. She was arrested and held in a
                  psychiatric ward for a number of days. Needless to
                  say, that wasn't an encouraging start.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Separation of Power Has Been Breached</b><br>
                  <b> </b>Disturbingly, while the governments of many
                  nations have the same separation of power as the U.S.,
                  where you have separate legislative, judiciary and
                  executive branches, we are now finding that this
                  separation has been breached and nearly destroyed in
                  most places.<br>
                  <br>
                  Rather than being run by the legislators that we voted
                  into power (and who have the legal power to make law),
                  we're being ruled by the executive branch, such as our
                  local governors, who are creating rules and
                  regulations without having the legal and
                  constitutional power to do so.<br>
                  <br>
                  They may issue emergency orders for a few days, but
                  really that's the extent of their legal power. After
                  that, the legislature must be brought in. Yet here we
                  are, several months into the pandemic, and local
                  governors and mayors all over the world are still
                  issuing long-term mandatory mask and social distancing
                  orders, many of which call for the arrest of those who
                  don't follow the rules.<br>
                  <br>
                  We now have plenty of data showing its lethality is on
                  par with the common flu and that the absolute risk of
                  death is equivalent to the risk of dying in a car
                  accident.<br>
                  <br>
                  As noted by Fuellmich, the judiciary branch must step
                  in, and now, finally, they are starting to do so. In
                  Austria, the constitutional court issued an order
                  November 12, 2020, not only clarifying the separation
                  of powers and stressing that the legislative branch
                  must be involved, but also that there must be a
                  comprehensive discussion where both sides are heard.
                  There are other scientists besides those anointed by
                  the government, and their opinions must be considered
                  as well.<br>
                  Suing the World Over Faux Pandemic<br>
                  <br>
                  As noted by Bet-David, there are several important
                  questions that must be answered:<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What caused the pandemic?<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who started it?<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who needs to be held accountable?<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In what way must they be held
                  accountable?<br>
                  <br>
                  Fuellmich agrees, saying that answering these
                  questions is the reason for why ACU was formed.
                  Governments appear unwilling to investigate the
                  answers to these questions, and that's why he and
                  three other attorneys decided to take on the task of
                  preparing class-action lawsuits. The primary questions
                  the ACU seeks to answer are:<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How dangerous is the virus, really?<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How trustworthy is the PCR test;
                  what does a positive test really mean?<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How much damage do the anti-COVID
                  measures inflict to the economy and the health and
                  well-being of the population?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>What Do We Now Know?</b><br>
                  The last question is easily answered, Fuellmich says.
                  Evidence shows pandemic measures have caused
                  tremendous harm, killing more people than the virus
                  itself by restricting routine medical care to people
                  with acute and chronic health conditions that have
                  nothing to do with COVID-19.<br>
                  <br>
                  As for the danger of SARS-CoV-2, we now have plenty of
                  data showing its lethality is on par with the common
                  flu7,8,9,10,11 and that the absolute risk of death is
                  equivalent to the risk of dying in a car
                  accident.12,13 It may be different in terms of
                  symptoms and complications, but the actual lethality
                  is about the same.<br>
                  <br>
                  According to Fuellmich, even the WHO has now admitted
                  that the mortality of COVID-19 is on par with seasonal
                  influenza. In October 2020, the WHO also reversed its
                  stance on lockdowns, stating they no longer recommend
                  using lockdowns as a primary control method.14<br>
                  <br>
                  Several experts have also stressed that there is no
                  excess mortality,15,16 meaning we've had an average
                  number of deaths during the pandemic as would normally
                  die anyway. And, if there's no excess mortality, how
                  can there be a lethal pandemic? It doesn't add up.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Fraudulent Testing Is Driving Pandemic Narrative</b><br>
                  Of the three questions, the second one is perhaps the
                  most important, as mass testing is driving the
                  narrative that we're in a lethal pandemic. As
                  explained by Fuellmich, reverse transcription
                  polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests have several
                  weaknesses that appear to be taken advantage of to
                  create needless fear.<br>
                  <br>
                  The fact is, the PCR test is not designed to be used
                  as a diagnostic tool as it cannot distinguish between
                  inactive viruses and "live" or reproductive ones.17
                  This is a crucial point, since inactive and
                  reproductive viruses are not interchangeable in terms
                  of infectivity. If you have a nonreproductive virus in
                  your body, you will not get sick and you cannot spread
                  it to others. <br>
                  <br>
                  Secondly, many if not most laboratories amplify the
                  RNA collected far too many times, which results in
                  healthy people testing "positive." The video above
                  explains how the PCR test works and how we are
                  interpreting results incorrectly.<br>
                  <br>
                  In summary, the PCR swab collects RNA from your nasal
                  cavity. This RNA is then reverse transcribed into DNA.
                  However, they must be amplified to become discernible.
                  Each round of amplification is called a cycle, and the
                  number of amplification cycles used by any given test
                  or lab is called a cycle threshold.<br>
                  <br>
                  When you go above 30 cycles, even insignificant
                  sequences of viral DNA end up being magnified to the
                  point that the test reads positive even if your viral
                  load is extremely low or the virus is inactive and
                  poses no threat to you or anyone else.<br>
                  <br>
                  According to Fuellmich, the consensus is that anything
                  over 35 cycles is scientifically indefensible. Yet
                  Drosten's test and tests recommended by the World
                  Health Organization are set to 45 cycles.18,19,20<br>
                  <br>
                  When labs use these excessive cycle thresholds, you
                  end up with a far higher number of positive tests than
                  you would otherwise. At present, and going back a
                  number of months now, what we're really dealing with
                  is a "casedemic,"21,22 meaning an epidemic of false
                  positives.<br>
                  <br>
                  Remember, in medical terminology, when used
                  accurately, a "case" refers to someone who has
                  symptoms of a disease. By erroneously reporting
                  positive tests as "cases," the pandemic appears
                  magnitudes worse than it actually is. For this reason,
                  Fuellmich and his team are primarily focused on the
                  PCR test issue.<br>
                  <br>
                  They've taken testimony from a number of
                  well-respected immunologists from around the world,
                  all of whom agree that the PCR test is incapable of
                  telling us anything about the transmission of
                  COVID-19.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>The Panic Paper</b><br>
                  According to Fuellmich, the sole reason the PCR test
                  is used, and used in an incorrect way, is to create
                  enough fear that no one will question the pandemic
                  measures being put into place and simply do as they're
                  told. He goes on to review the so-called "Panic
                  Paper,"23,24 written by the German Department of the
                  Interior.<br>
                  <br>
                  This classified paper, which was leaked to the press,
                  reveals there was an intentional plan at the level of
                  the German government to drive people into a panic.<br>
                  <br>
                  One of the strategies laid out in the paper was to
                  guilt children into compliance, to make them feel
                  responsible "for the tortured death of their parents
                  and grandparents if they do not follow the anti-corona
                  regulations." According to Fuellmich, what we have is
                  a staged PCR test pandemic. It's not a lethal virus
                  pandemic, "and I can prove this in court," he says.<br>
                  What's the End Game?<br>
                  <br>
                  As noted by Fuellmich, more and more people around the
                  world are now starting to wake up to the fact that the
                  restrictions put into place under the guise of
                  protecting public health are not going away anytime
                  soon. They're part of a much larger, long-term plan,
                  and the end goal is to usher in a new way of life,
                  devoid of our previous freedoms.<br>
                  <br>
                  The judicial branch is "the last anchor of democracy,"
                  Fuellmich says. He brings up an important point. The
                  WHO, the World Economic Forum and the United Nations
                  are all private corporations, yet they wield
                  tremendous power over the governments of the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  The World Economic Forum, founded by Klaus Schwab, is
                  incredibly influential and lobbies politicians around
                  the globe. Together, private corporations and
                  politicians have in some instances usurped power from
                  the government and are acting above the law of the
                  land.<br>
                  <br>
                  Big Tech plays an important part in this usurpation of
                  power. The most important human right around the world
                  is the right to free speech. It's foundational for any
                  democracy. Yet the tech giants have all banded
                  together to censor certain segments of the global
                  population.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have to take back the power
                  from them and put it back where it belongs, with the
                  government, and we have to take a really close look at
                  who is in government and who became too close to these
                  corporations," Fuellmich says.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Key Players</b><br>
                  While the full picture is still being put together,
                  Fuellmich and his team have some ideas of who the key
                  players are, at least in Germany. They include the
                  Christian Democratic Union (CDU) of Germany, Drosten,
                  Wieler (the head of the German equivalent of the CDC),
                  Ghebreyesus (head of the WHO), the Bill &amp; Melinda
                  Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.<br>
                  <br>
                  These individuals have repeatedly met over the years,
                  including in May 2019, at which time they discussed
                  plans for a coming pandemic. During this meeting,
                  Drosten explained how his PCR test would be used to
                  identify infections — "A blatant lie, as we now know
                  it," Fuellmich says.<br>
                  <br>
                  These were the same individuals who in 2020 rolled out
                  the narrative for the COVID-19 pandemic and pushed for
                  the global implementation of PCR testing, mask
                  wearing, social distancing and the shut-down of
                  economies around the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  According to Fuellmich, Germany is at the center of
                  this global fraud, and three of the key criminals in
                  this case appear to be Drosten, Wieler and Ghebreyesus
                  — and the organizations behind them.<br>
                  <br>
                  That said, he also admits there must be others behind
                  these public marionettes that are pulling the strings.
                  Fuellmich believes that through pretrial discovery,
                  these shadowy figures will eventually come to light.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Battle Plan</b><br>
                  As mentioned earlier, we must now push the judicial
                  branch of our government to step in. Fuellmich
                  explains:<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have the power [to ask] courts
                  of law to step in, but we have to show in a court of
                  law that this is not a corona pandemic but rather a
                  staged PCR pandemic, which was made up — invented —
                  for completely different purposes, for these
                  corporations.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We do not know exactly who is
                  responsible, but we see that some of the corporations
                  that are now censoring us are in part responsible; we
                  know some people — such as Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab or
                  Blackrock — were investing their money into
                  pharmaceutical and technical companies. Also, the
                  mainstream media, they [have been] brought into line
                  and are not going to report on the other side of the
                  story.<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to bring out this story,
                  we have to have a court of law that will take a look
                  at the evidence that is there … And that's what we're
                  doing right now. We're doing this both in Germany and
                  in the United States … The U.S. and Canada are so
                  important in this because they are the two countries
                  that have class-actions."<br>
                  <br>
                  At present, class-action lawsuits are being prepared
                  in the U.S. and Canada. Lawsuits are also being
                  prepared in Germany. Germany does not permit
                  class-actions so, there, the process is being done a
                  bit differently. ACU is also working on the creation
                  of legal guidelines and data caches that attorneys
                  around the world will be able to use to file their own
                  lawsuits.<br>
                  <br>
                  As for the average person, Fuellmich urges everyone
                  to, first of all, don't give up, and secondly, ask
                  lots of questions. Continue asking questions because
                  the more questions are asked, the more answers will
                  come to light. Continue to counter the censorship by
                  asking questions. Once court hearings begin, the
                  information will start to spread more quickly.<br>
                  <br>

                      Fearmongering and Ignorance</b><br>
                    <b>By Jeff Harris</b><br>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  Ever since the alleged pandemic erupted this past
                  March the mainstream media has spewed a non-stop
                  stream of misinformation that appears to be laser
                  focused on generating maximum fear among the
                  citizenry. But the facts and the science simply don’t
                  support the grave picture painted of a deadly virus
                  sweeping the land.<br>
                  Yes we do have a pandemic, but it’ a pandemic of
                  ginned up pseudo-science masquerading as unbiased
                  fact. Here are nine facts backed up with data, in many
                  cases from the CDC itself that paints a very different
                  picture from the fear and dread being relentlessly
                  drummed into the brains of unsuspecting citizens.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>1) The PCR test is practically useless</b><br>
                  <b> </b>According to an article in the New York Times
                  August 29th 2020 testing for the Covid-19 virus using
                  the popular PCR method results in up to 90% of those
                  tested showing positive results that are grossly
                  misleading.<br>
                  Officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada
                  compiled testing data that revealed the PCR test can
                  NOT determine the amount of virus in a sample. (viral
                  load) The amount of virus in up to 90% of positive
                  results turned out to be so miniscule that the patient
                  was asymptomatic and posed no threat to others. So the
                  positive Covid-19 tests are virtually meaningless.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>2) A positive test is NOT a CASE</b><br>
                  <b> </b>For some reason every positive Covid-19 test
                  is immediately designated a CASE. As we saw in #1
                  above up to 90% of positive Covid-19 tests result in
                  miniscule amounts of virus that do not sicken the
                  subject. Historically only patients who demonstrated
                  actual symptoms of an illness were considered a case.
                  Publishing positive test results as “CASES” is grossly
                  misleading and needlessly alarming.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>3) The Centers for Disease Control dramatically
                    lowered the Covid-19 Death Count </b><br>
                  <b> </b>On August 30th the CDC released new data that
                  showed only 6% of the deaths previously attributed to
                  Covid-19 were due exclusively to the virus. The vast
                  majority, 94%, may have had exposure to Covid-19 but
                  also had preexisting illnesses like heart disease,
                  obesity, hypertension, cancer and various respiratory
                  illnesses. While they died with Covid-19 they did NOT
                  die exclusively from Covid-19.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>4) CDC reports Covid-19 Survival Rate over 99% </b><br>
                  <b> </b>The “Second Wave”: Politics Influences the
                  “Science” of COVID-19. Flawed Data, Flawed Models<br>
                  The CDC updated their “Current Best Estimate” for
                  Covid-19 survival on September 10th showing that over
                  99% of people exposed to the virus survived. Another
                  way to say this is that less than 1% of the exposures
                  are potentially life threatening. According to the CDC
                  the vast majority of deaths attributed to Covid-19
                  were concentrated in the population over age 70, close
                  to normal life expectancy.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>5) CDC reveals 85% of Positive Covid cases wore
                    face masks Always or Often </b><br>
                  <b> </b>In September of 2020 the CDC released the
                  results of a study conducted in July where they
                  discovered that 85% of the positive Covid test
                  subjects reported wearing a cloth face mask always or
                  often for two weeks prior to testing positive. The
                  majority, 71% of the test subjects reported always
                  wearing a cloth face mask and 14% reported often
                  wearing a cloth face mask. The only rational
                  conclusion from this study is that cloth face masks
                  offer little if any protection from Covid-19
                  infection.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>6) There are inexpensive, proven therapies for
                    Covid-19</b><br>
                  <b> </b>Harvey Risch, MD, PhD heads the Yale
                  University School of Epidemiology. He authored “The
                  Key to Defeating Covid-19 Already Exists. We Need to
                  Start Using It”which was published in Newsweek
                  Magazine July 23rd, 2020. Dr. Risch documents the
                  proven effectiveness of treating patients diagnosed
                  with Covid-19 using a combination of
                  Hydroxychloroquine, an antibiotic like azithromycin
                  and the nutritional supplement zinc. Medical Doctors
                  across the globe have reported very positive results
                  using this protocol particularly for early stage Covid
                  patients.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>7) The US Death Rate is NOT spiking</b><br>
                  <b> </b>If Covid-19 was the lethal killer it’s made
                  out to be one would reasonably expect to see a
                  significant spike in the number of deaths reported.
                  But that hasn’t happened. According to the CDC as of
                  early May 2020 the total number of deaths in the US
                  was 944,251 from January 1 – April 30th. This is
                  actually slightly lower than the number of deaths
                  during the same period in 2017 when 946,067 total
                  deaths were reported.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>8) Most Covid-19 Deaths Occur at the End of a
                    normal Lifespan</b><br>
                  <b> </b>According to the CDC as of 2017 US males can
                  expect a normal lifespan of 76.1 years and females
                  81.1 years. A little over 80% of the suspected
                  Covid-19 deaths have occurred in people over age 65.
                  According to a June 28th New York Post article almost
                  half of all Covid suspected deaths have occurred in
                  Nursing Homes which predominately house people with
                  preexisting health conditions and close to or past
                  their normal life expectancy.<br>

                  <b>9) CDC Data Shows Minimal Covid Risk to Children
                    and Young Adults</b><br>
                  <b> </b>The CDC reported in their September 10th
                  update that it’s estimated Infection Mortality Rate
                  (IFR) for children age 0-19 was so low that 99.97% of
                  those infected with the virus survived. For 20-49
                  year-olds the survival rate was almost as good at
                  99.98%. Even those 70 years-old and older had a
                  survival rate of 94.6%. To put this in perspective the
                  CDC data suggest that a child or young adult up to age
                  19 has a greater chance of death from some type of
                  accident than they do from Covid-19.<br>
                  Taken together it should be obvious that Covid-19 is
                  pretty similar to typical flu viruses that sicken some
                  people annually. The vast majority are able to
                  successfully fight off the virus with their body’s
                  natural immune system. Common sense precautions should
                  be taken, particularly by those over age 65 that
                  suffer from preexisting medical conditions.<br>
                  The gross over reaction by government leaders to this
                  illness is causing much more distress, physical,
                  emotional and financial, than the virus ever could on
                  its own. The bottom line is there is NO pandemic, just
                  a typical flu season that has been wildly blown out of
                  proportion by 24/7 media propaganda and enabled by the
                  masses paralyzed by irrational fear.<br>
                  State and local governments in particular have ignored
                  the rights of the people and have instituted
                  outrageous attacks on freedom and liberty that was
                  bought and paid for by the blood and sacrifice of our
                  forefathers.<br>
                  Slowly the people are recognizing the great fraud
                  perpetrated on them by bureaucrats and elected
                  officials who have sworn to uphold rights and freedoms
                  as spelled out in the US Constitution. The time has
                  come to hold these criminals accountable by utilizing
                  the legal system to bring them to justice.<br>
                  Either we act now to preserve freedom and liberty for
                  our children and future generations yet unborn, or we
                  meekly submit to tyrants who crave more power and
                  control. I will not comply!<br>

                      policy - Swedish expert Prof. Johan Giesecke</b><br>
                    <b>UnHerd</b><br>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  That was one of the more extraordinary interviews we
                  have done here at UnHerd.<br>
                  Professor Johan Giesecke, one of the world’s most
                  senior epidemiologists, advisor to the Swedish
                  Government (he hired Anders Tegnell who is currently
                  directing Swedish strategy), the first Chief Scientist
                  of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
                  Control, and an advisor to the director general of the
                  WHO, lays out with typically Swedish bluntness why he
                  thinks:<br>
                  <br>
                  - UK policy on lockdown and other European countries
                  are not evidence-based<br>
                  - The correct policy is to protect the old and the
                  frail only<br>
                  - This will eventually lead to herd immunity as a
                  “by-product”<br>
                  - The initial UK response, before the “180 degree
                  U-turn”, was better<br>
                  - The Imperial College paper was “not very good” and
                  he has never seen an unpublished paper have so much
                  policy impact<br>
                  - The paper was very much too pessimistic<br>
                  - Any such models are a dubious basis for public
                  policy anyway<br>
                  - The flattening of the curve is due to the most
                  vulnerable dying first as much as the lockdown<br>
                  - The results will eventually be similar for all
                  countries<br>
                  - Covid-19 is a “mild disease” and similar to the flu,
                  and it was the novelty of the disease that scared
                  people.<br>
                  - The actual fatality rate of Covid-19 is the region
                  of 0.1%<br>
                  - At least 50% of the population of both the UK and
                  Sweden will be shown to have already had the disease
                  when mass antibody testing becomes available<br>

                  ...The researchers, from North Carolina State
                  University, carried out lab studies and computer
                  simulations to examine how the so-called main protease
                  (Mpro) in the coronavirus reacted to the plant
                  compounds.<br>
                  “Mpro in SARS-CoV-2 is required for the virus to
                  replicate and assemble itself. If we can inhibit or
                  deactivate this protease, the virus will die,” the
                  study’s corresponding author, DeYu Xie, explained.<br>
                  The investigations discovered that the chemical
                  compounds found in the foods and drinks fill up a
                  ‘pocket’ in the Mpro, rendering it useless,
                  effectively stopping the virus from replicating.<br>
                  “Green tea has five tested chemical compounds that
                  bind to different sites in the pocket on Mpro,
                  essentially overwhelming it to inhibit its function,”
                  Xie said.<br>
                  “Muscadine grapes contain these inhibitory chemicals
                  in their skins and seeds. Plants use these compounds
                  to protect themselves, so it is not surprising that
                  plant leaves and skins contain these beneficial
                  compounds.”.. <br>

                  We report to use the main protease (Mpro) of
                  SARS-Cov-2 to screen plant flavan-3-ols and
                  proanthocyanidins. Twelve compounds, (–)-afzelechin
                  (AF), (–)-epiafzelechin (EAF), (+)-catechin (CA),
                  (–)-epicatechin (EC), (+)-gallocatechin (GC),
                  (–)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (+)-catechin-3-O-gallate
                  (CAG), (–)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate (ECG),
                  (–)-gallocatechin-3-O-gallate (GCG),
                  (–)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), procyanidin
                  A2 (PA2), and procyanidin B2 (PB2), were selected for
                  docking simulation. The resulting data predicted that
                  all 12 metabolites could bind to Mpro. The affinity
                  scores of PA2 and PB2 were predicted to be −9.2,
                  followed by ECG, GCG, EGCG, and CAG, −8.3 to −8.7, and
                  then six flavan-3-ol aglycones, −7.0 to −7.7. Docking
                  characterization predicted that these compounds bound
                  to three or four subsites (S1, S1′, S2, and S4) in the
                  binding pocket of Mpro via different spatial ways and
                  various formation of one to four hydrogen bonds. In
                  vitro analysis with 10 available compounds showed that
                  CAG, ECG, GCG, EGCG, and PB2 inhibited the Mpro
                  activity with an IC50 value, 2.98 ± 0.21, 5.21 ± 0.5,
                  6.38 ± 0.5, 7.51 ± 0.21, and 75.3 ± 1.29 μM,
                  respectively, while CA, EC, EGC, GC, and PA2 did not
                  have inhibitory activities. To further substantiate
                  the inhibitory activities, extracts prepared from
                  green tea (GT), two muscadine grapes (MG), cacao, and
                  dark chocolate (DC), which are rich in CAG, ECG, GAG,
                  EGCG, or/and PB2, were used for inhibitory assay. The
                  resulting data showed that GT, two MG, cacao, and DC
                  extracts inhibited the Mpro activity with an IC50
                  value, 2.84 ± 0.25, 29.54 ± 0.41, 29.93 ± 0.83, 153.3
                  ± 47.3, and 256.39 ± 66.3 μg/ml, respectively. These
                  findings indicate that on the one hand, the structural
                  features of flavan-3-ols are closely associated with
                  the affinity scores; on the other hand, the
                  galloylation and oligomeric types of flavan-3-ols are
                  critical in creating the inhibitory activity against
                  the Mpro activity.<br>

                  Cut to the facts about coronavirus in Corona, False
                  Alarm?, the runaway German bestseller. In June 2020,
                  Corona, False Alarm? exploded into the German market,
                  selling 200,000 copies and 75,000 e-books in six
                  weeks. No other topic dominates our attention as much
                  as coronavirus and COVID-19, the infectious disease it
                  triggers. There's been a global deluge of
                  contradictory opinions, fake news, and politically
                  controlled information. Differing views on the dangers
                  posed by the pandemic have led to deep division and
                  confusion, within governments, society, and even among
                  friends and family. In Corona, False Alarm?,
                  award-winning researchers Dr. Sucharit Bhakdi and Dr.
                  Karina Reiss give clarity to these confusing and
                  stressful times. They offer analysis of whether
                  radical protective measures-including lockdown, social
                  distancing, and mandatory masking-have been justified,
                  and what the ramifications have been for society, the
                  economy, and public health. Dr. Bhakdi and Dr. Reiss
                  provide dates, facts, and background information,
                  including: How Covid-19 compares with previous
                  coronaviruses and the flu virus What infection numbers
                  and the death rate really tell us The challenges
                  around lockdown: Were the protective measures
                  justified? Mandatory mask-wearing: Does the science
                  support it? Does the race for vaccine development make
                  sense? What are the chances of success? Will the
                  vaccine be safe? Will people accept it? Corona, False
                  Alarm? provides you with sound information and
                  substantiated facts-and encourages you to form your
                  own opinion on the corona crisis. <br>

                      microscope that can see through an intact skull</b><br>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  Non-invasive microscopic techniques such as optical
                  coherence microscopy and two-photon microscopy are
                  commonly used for in vivo imaging of living tissues.
                  When light passes through turbid materials such as
                  biological tissues, two types of light are generated:
                  ballistic photons and multiply scattered photons. The
                  ballistic photons travel straight through the object
                  without experiencing any deflection and hence is used
                  to reconstruct the object image. On the other hand,
                  the multiply scattered photons are generated via
                  random deflections as the light passes through the
                  material and show up as speckle noise in the
                  reconstructed image. As the light propagates through
                  increasing distances, the ratio between multiply
                  scattered and ballistic photons increases drastically,
                  thereby obscuring the image information. In addition
                  to the noise generated by the multiply scattered
                  light, optical aberration of ballistic light also
                  causes contrast reduction and image blur during the
                  image reconstruction process...<br>
                  Recently, a research team led by Prof. CHOI Wonshik at
                  the Center for Molecular Spectroscopy and Dynamics
                  within the Institute of Basic Science (IBS) in Seoul,
                  South Korea made a major breakthrough in deep-tissue
                  optical imaging. They developed a novel optical
                  microscope that can image through an intact mouse
                  skull and acquire a microscopic map of neural networks
                  in the brain tissues without losing spatial
                  resolution.<br>
                  This new microscope is termed as a reflection matrix
                  microscope, and it combines the powers of both
                  hardware and computational adaptive optics (AO), which
                  is a technology originally developed for ground-based
                  astronomy to correct optical aberrations. While
                  conventional confocal microscope measures reflection
                  signal only at the focal point of illumination and
                  discard all out of focus light, the reflection matrix
                  microscope records all the scattered photons at
                  positions other than the focal point. The scattered
                  photons are then computationally corrected using a
                  novel AO algorithm called closed-loop accumulation of
                  single scattering (CLASS), which the team developed
                  back in 2017. The algorithm exploits all scattered
                  light to selectively extract ballistic light and
                  correct severe optical aberration. Compared to the
                  most conventional AO microscopy systems, which require
                  bright point-like reflectors or fluorescent objects as
                  guide stars similarly to the use of AO in astronomy,
                  the reflection matrix microscope works without any
                  fluorescent labeling and without depending on the
                  target’s structures. In addition, the number of
                  aberration modes that can be corrected is more than 10
                  times greater than that of the conventional AO
                  systems...<br>

                  Peruvian Doctors for the Truth have issued a short
                  video, explaining the enormous risks of the three
                  different types of vaccines currently on the market in
                  Peru, two of them are genetically engineered in one
                  way or another and will affect the human DNA. Humans
                  would become “transhumans”, like genetically modified
                  corn, soja, cotton – and more.<br>
                  The breaking part of this news is that there is yet
                  another medication, called IVERMECTIN, that has been
                  FDA-approved and already successfully applied in
                  Southern Peru, in Argentina and elsewhere. See this.<br>
                  Ivermectin, a medication known for over 60 years, has
                  been applied successfully for many infectious diseases
                  – including river-blindness, throughout Africa. It was
                  highly recommended by WHO, at a time when WHO still
                  had a human touch.<br>
                  The third vaccine would be recreating a weaker version
                  of the virus in your body. The more traditional type
                  of vaccine. But none of them has been seriously
                  tested.<br>
                  The trans-genetic ones have not even been
                  animal-tested. And the few voluntary tests that were
                  carried out in particular with the Moderna vaccine
                  have left disastrous results. While none of the 40
                  robust volunteers died, all of them had serious side
                  effects, serious health problems and had to be
                  hospitalized – and the long-term consequences are not
                  known. How they turn around now, Pfizer-BioNTech,
                  Moderna and AstraZeneca, claiming up to 95%
                  efficiency. What a joke!!! Never tested – and lying to
                  the people, so they will buy into the fraud.<br>
                  The long-term consequences of any of these vaccines
                  are not known, will not be known for a long time. And
                  nobody can sue any of the pharma companies, they are
                  “immune” under the 1986 Supreme Court ratified
                  National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) (42
                  U.S.C. §§ 300aa- 1 to 300aa-34).<br>
                  Pharma companies can never be sued for any damage
                  their vaccines cause.<br>
                  One of the long-term effects of covid-19 vaccines, may
                  be reduced virility for men and infertility for women.
                  This fits the Bill Gates, Rockefeller et al eugenics
                  agenda (Bill Gates TedTalk in 2010 – “Innovating to
                  Zero”). Provides an early flavor of what the Gates and
                  Co. clan have in mind for humanity.<br>
                  With support of WHO, Bill Gates initiated in 2010 and
                  2014 in Kenya a tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccination
                  program:<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1993, WHO announced a
                  “birth-control vaccine” for “family planning”.
                  Published research shows that by 1976 WHO researchers
                  had conjugated tetanus toxoid (TT) with human
                  chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) producing a
                  “birth-control” vaccine. Conjugating TT with hCG
                  causes pregnancy hormones to be attacked by the immune
                  system. Expected results are abortions in females
                  already pregnant and/or infertility in recipients not
                  yet impregnated. Repeated inoculations prolong
                  infertility. Currently WHO researchers are working on
                  more potent anti-fertility vaccines using recombinant
                  DNA. WHO publications show a long-range purpose to
                  reduce population growth in unstable “less developed
                  countries”. By November 1993 Catholic publications
                  appeared saying an abortifacient vaccine was being
                  used as a tetanus prophylactic. In November 2014, the
                  Catholic Church asserted that such a program was
                  underway in Kenya. Three independent Nairobi
                  accredited biochemistry laboratories tested samples
                  from vials of the WHO tetanus vaccine being used in
                  March 2014 and found hCG where none should be present.
                  In October 2014, 6 additional vials were obtained by
                  Catholic doctors and were tested in 6 accredited
                  laboratories. Again, hCG was found in half the
                  samples. Subsequently, Nairobi’s AgriQ Quest
                  laboratory, in two sets of analyses, again found hCG
                  in the same vaccine vials that tested positive earlier
                  but found no hCG in 52 samples alleged by the WHO to
                  be vials of the vaccine used in the Kenya campaign 40
                  with the same identifying batch numbers as the vials
                  that tested positive for hCG. Given that hCG was found
                  in at least half the WHO vaccine samples known by the
                  doctors involved in administering the vaccines to have
                  been used in Kenya, our opinion is that the Kenya
                  “anti-tetanus” campaign was reasonably called into
                  question by the Kenya Catholic Doctors Association as
                  a front for population growth reduction.<br>
                  The Kenyan Government sued WHO – which is immune for
                  lawsuits, but had to officially apologize.<br>
                  Since Bill Gates and his Foundation are behind this
                  obsessive vaxxer craze, and they are supported by the
                  very institution – a UN organization- imagine!!! – WHO
                  – for which Bill Gates is one of the biggest single
                  funders, it is not unlikely that Covid vaccines may
                  contain similar sterilization components – the effect
                  of which may not be seen immediately – but only over
                  time, and especially, the weakened virility and
                  fertility may be passed on genetically to future
                  generations.<br>
                  Back to the three vaccines the medical doctor of
                  Peru’s Doctors for the Truth mentions. The vaccine
                  based on replication of a weaker virus version – has
                  not been tested either. The Tuberculosis vaccine – a
                  similar type – was tested for 17 years before it was
                  applied large-scale. The next-in-line for SARS was
                  tested during 5 ½ years.<br>
                  We are talking about enormous risks – and with the
                  fear – the extreme fear instilled in people – it is
                  likely that there will be long lines when the vaccines
                  become available – and people think after being
                  inoculated with one of them, they will be home free
                  and life will go back to “normal”.<br>
                  It will not. Be aware. Life will not go back to
                  normal.<br>
                  Only our fierce resistance may eventually bring a
                  return to something similar to what we once knew as
                  normal. But it will be a new “normal” made by the
                  people, for the people; and NOT by an ultra-rich elite
                  – of which the 193 UN member governments and their
                  respective parliaments were coopted as being part –
                  bought, coerced, bribed. Not a “new normal”, as
                  proposed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) – The Great
                  Reset (Klaus Schwab – July 2020), or the IMF, The
                  Great Transformation.<br>
                  This is just the beginning. If you let yourself be
                  inoculated by these treacherous politicians – like
                  Boris Johnson – who orders vaccination to start next
                  week, i.e. in the week beginning on 7 December 2020 –
                  with a vaccine that has not been tested, you may be in
                  for nefarious surprises.<br>
                  People, victims of the British warp-speed vaccination
                  program, have no idea what is being jabbed into their
                  bodies. This man, PM of the UK – is inhuman. The harm
                  he may inflict on the British population is criminal.
                  BoJo, one who serves a higher order, but for nothing
                  does he serve the people of the country that he had
                  been chosen to serve, the people who pay his salary.
                  If so far, the vaccination is not forced or
                  compulsory, it is nevertheless heavily encouraged with
                  fear propaganda.<br>
                  The solution? – First, No Fear; second: Civil
                  disobedience. Boycott he vaccination program, demand
                  being treated by alternatives, like Ivermectin – and
                  there are many others – many of which are banned by
                  governments. They were forced to ban them, by the very
                  higher “orders” that are in bed with the pharma
                  industry, for profit greed – trillions of dollars – to
                  be made by the vaccine campains.<br>
                  Say no to vaccination en masse, and count on herd
                  immunity which is the logical next phase – and no
                  vaccine is needed. Do not get bogged-down in fear.<br>
                  Stand up for your rights. Fear is killing your
                  self-esteem.<br>
                  Your civil and human rights cannot, I repeat, CANNOT,
                  be obliterated as the reigning 193 UN member
                  governments are intent of doing. See also The Secret
                  Agenda of the World Bank and the IMF.<br>
                  Unfortunately, there is hardly a government left that

                  eviscerate your civil and human rights. Do not follow
                  the mainstream media – look for alternative
                  information – and when you see that such information
                  suddenly disappears from the internet, from youtube,
                  or is being “fact-checked”, you know that you are on
                  the right track.<br>
                  There has never in recent history been a time of more
                  censoring of more “fake news” planted by the very
                  mainstream media.<br>

                  Be self-assured.<br>

                      A nasal antiviral created by researchers at
                      Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians
                      and Surgeons blocked transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in
                      ferrets, suggesting the nasal spray also may
                      prevent infection in people exposed to the new
                      coronavirus.<br>
                      <br>
                      The compound in the spray—a lipopeptide developed
                      by Anne Moscona, MD, and Matteo Porotto, PhD,
                      professors in the Department of Pediatrics and
                      directors of the Center for Host-Pathogen
                      Interaction—is designed to prevent the new
                      coronavirus from entering host cells.<br>
                      <br>
                      The antiviral lipopeptide is inexpensive to
                      produce, has a long shelf life, and does not
                      require refrigeration. These features make it
                      stand out from other antiviral approaches under
                      development, including monoclonal antibodies. The
                      new nasal lipopeptide could be ideal for halting
                      the spread of COVID in the United States and
                      globally; the transportable and stable compound

                      <b>Abstract</b><br>
                      Containment of the COVID-19 pandemic requires
                      reducing viral transmission. SARS-CoV-2 infection
                      is initiated by membrane fusion between the viral
                      and host cell membranes, mediated by the viral
                      spike protein. We have designed a dimeric
                      lipopeptide fusion inhibitor that blocks this
                      critical first step of infection for emerging
                      coronaviruses and document that it completely
                      prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets. Daily
                      intranasal administration to ferrets completely
                      prevented SARS-CoV-2 direct-contact transmission
                      during 24-hour co-housing with infected animals,
                      under stringent conditions that resulted in
                      infection of 100% of untreated animals. These
                      lipopeptides are highly stable and non-toxic and
                      thus readily translate into a safe and effective
                      intranasal prophylactic approach to reduce
                      transmission of SARS-CoV-2.<br>

                      (Neither should you)<br>
                      <br>
                      During a press briefing broadcast live over
                      multiple social media platforms, Bolsonaro said
                      that he has already decided to refuse a future
                      coronavirus vaccine.<br>
                      <br>
                      “I’m telling you, I’m not going to take it. It’s
                      my right,” he said.<br>
                      <br>
                      The right-wing leader has repeatedly stated that
                      Brazilians will not be required to be vaccinated
                      once a Chinese coronavirus vaccine becomes widely
                      available. Bolsonaro reiterated this at a press
                      briefing, saying that Brazil’s Congress was
                      unlikely to require Brazilians to take a future
                      coronavirus vaccine.<br>
                      <br>
                      “The [Brazilian] president also expressed
                      skepticism about the effectiveness of the use of
                      masks during the live broadcast, implying that
                      there was little conclusive evidence of its
                      success in curbing the transmission of the virus,”
                      according to South American news site Infobae.<br>
                      <br>
                      Bolsonaro has tested positive for the Chinese
                      coronavirus at least two times. After contracting
                      the virus for the first time on July 7, Bolsonaro
                      said he initially suffered from a low-grade fever
                      and mild symptoms. Announcing his positive
                      diagnosis at a press conference held outside on
                      the grounds of Brazil’s presidential palace,
                      Bolsonaro stepped back and removed his mask to
                      demonstrate to the public that he was “absolutely
                      fine” despite the mild symptoms.<br>
                      <br>
                      He subsequently entered a period of semi-isolation
                      for nearly 20 days while recovering from the
                      virus. During this period, the leader continued to
                      venture out on the grounds of the presidential
                      palace to greet his supporters. A proponent of the
                      anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as an
                      anti-coronavirus therapy, Bolsonaro said he
                      received the drug as part of his own treatment.
                      The president announced via Twitter on July 25
                      that he had tested negative for coronavirus.<br>
                      <br>
                      “I’m healed from Covid. I have antibodies, no
                      problems. In my particular case, I first thank
                      God, and secondly, the medication prescribed by
                      the presidential doctor: hydroxychloroquine,”
                      Bolsonaro said on July 30.<br>
                      <br>
                      “The following day, I was already OK. If it was a
                      coincidence or not, I don’t know. But it works,”
                      the leader added.<br>
                      <br>
                      ALTERS HUMAN DNA<br>
                      <br>
                      There are real issues surrounding the so-called
                      COVID-19 Vaccines.&nbsp; They are NOT "vaccines"
                      in any traditional sense.<br>
                      <br>
                      In the past, to create a vaccine, scientists
                      isolated in a laboratory, the pathogen which
                      causes illness.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once isolated,
                      scientists take the DNA "guts" out of the virus,
                      and replace those "guts" with harmless yeast
                      guts.&nbsp; In other words, they "recombine" the
                      virus with harmless yeast guts.&nbsp; <br>
                      <br>
                      So the outside of the virus looks like the
                      pathogen making people sick, but the guts are
                      harmless yeast.&nbsp; This is called a
                      "recombinant" vaccine because they recombined the
                      outer virus envelope with harmless yeast DNA guts.<br>
                      <br>
                      They reproduce this new harmless "virus" and
                      inject the harmless recombinant virus into humans.<br>
                      <br>
                      When our body sees the outside of this "invader"
                      it begins its immune response and we develop
                      immunity to what the original virus LOOKED LIKE on
                      its outside.&nbsp; <br>
                      <br>
                      THAT is how old vaccines worked.<br>
                      <br>
                      This new COVID-19 vaccine is nothing like the
                      old.&nbsp;&nbsp; This new vaccine contains
                      "messenger RNA"&nbsp; Ribo-nucleic-acid; a base
                      level of Deoxy-ribonucleic-acid (DNA).&nbsp;&nbsp;
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      It "programs" the human into whom it is injected
                      so that human's DNA triggers a response to what
                      would be COVID-19.<br>
                      <br>
                      The trouble is, scientists don't know exactly what
                      ELSE this RNA might "program" once is is let loose
                      inside a human!<br>
                      <br>
                      It might start re-programming OTHER aspects of
                      human DNA.&nbsp; <br>
                      <br>
                      In a horrifying possibility, once unleashed, these
                      "messenger RNA" particles could turn someone from
                      human into . . . . not human!<br>
                      <br>
                      There's no way to tell.<br>
                      <br>
                      Worse, there's no way to UN DO what this messenger
                      RNA does.&nbsp; The changes are permanent and
                      cannot be undone.<br>
                      <br>
                      From a scientific stand point, there could be
                      deadly results from this messenger RNA if it
                      causes changes to a human that make it impossible
                      for the person to live.<br>
                      <br>
                      Almost 100% of the people who agreed to accept
                      this vaccine in clinical trials, have had very
                      strong adverse reactions to it.&nbsp; Some have
                      DIED!<br>
                      <br>
                      ALL of the animal testing of this vaccine had to
                      be stopped because ALL the animals DIED.<br>
                      <br>
                      Instead of taking this as a red flag warning,
                      authorities merely "waived" the requirement for
                      animal testing and went straight to human
                      testing!!!!!!!<br>
                      <br>
                      As stated earlier, almost 100% of those who
                      received the vaccine in trials, suffered VERY
                      STRONG adverse reactions.<br>
                      <br>
                      That's the scientific aspect, but there's another
                      aspect: From a RELIGIOUS stand point, it could
                      alter a person so they are no longer recognizable
                      as "human" by God.<br>
                      <br>
                      The book of Revelations warns about this, and does
                      so SPECIFICALLY in Revelation 18:23 --<br>
                      <br>
                      And the light of a candle shall shine no more at
                      all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and
                      of the bride shall be heard no more at all in
                      thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the
                      earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations
                      deceived.<br>
                      <br>
                      We all know the Bible was translated from Hebrew /
                      Aramaic into Greek, first.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the
                      origin of sorcery in Greek language: Pharmakeia
                      (Pharmaceuticals!) (Link)<br>
                      <br>
                      So Brazil President Balsonaro has multiple reasons
                      for him NOT TAKING the vaccine.&nbsp; Now, you
                      have those same reasons.<br>
                      <br>
                      Do not be deceived by Pharmaceutical companies
                      into taking a vaccine that alters your DNA.&nbsp;
                      The changes it causes will be irreversible and
                      could cost you literally everything.<br>

          Brazil President Says "No" - Won't Take COVID Vaccine --
          Neither Should You!<br>
          Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says that he will not take
          a coronavirus vaccine.&nbsp; (Neither should you)<br>
          During a press briefing broadcast live over multiple social
          media platforms, Bolsonaro said that he has already decided to
          refuse a future coronavirus vaccine.<br>
          “I’m telling you, I’m not going to take it. It’s my right,” he
          said.<br>
          The right-wing leader has repeatedly stated that Brazilians
          will not be required to be vaccinated once a Chinese
          coronavirus vaccine becomes widely available. Bolsonaro
          reiterated this at a press briefing, saying that Brazil’s
          Congress was unlikely to require Brazilians to take a future
          coronavirus vaccine.<br>
          “The [Brazilian] president also expressed skepticism about the
          effectiveness of the use of masks during the live broadcast,
          implying that there was little conclusive evidence of its
          success in curbing the transmission of the virus,” according
          to South American news site Infobae.<br>
          Bolsonaro has tested positive for the Chinese coronavirus at
          least two times. After contracting the virus for the first
          time on July 7, Bolsonaro said he initially suffered from a
          low-grade fever and mild symptoms. Announcing his positive
          diagnosis at a press conference held outside on the grounds of
          Brazil’s presidential palace, Bolsonaro stepped back and
          removed his mask to demonstrate to the public that he was
          “absolutely fine” despite the mild symptoms.<br>
          He subsequently entered a period of semi-isolation for nearly
          20 days while recovering from the virus. During this period,
          the leader continued to venture out on the grounds of the
          presidential palace to greet his supporters. A proponent of
          the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as an
          anti-coronavirus therapy, Bolsonaro said he received the drug
          as part of his own treatment. The president announced via
          Twitter on July 25 that he had tested negative for
          coronavirus.<br>
          “I’m healed from Covid. I have antibodies, no problems. In my
          particular case, I first thank God, and secondly, the
          medication prescribed by the presidential doctor:
          hydroxychloroquine,” Bolsonaro said on July 30.<br>
          “The following day, I was already OK. If it was a coincidence
          or not, I don’t know. But it works,” the leader added.<br>

          <b>ALTERS HUMAN DNA</b><br>
          There are real issues surrounding the so-called COVID-19
          Vaccines.&nbsp; They are NOT "vaccines" in any traditional
          sense.<br>
          In the past, to create a vaccine, scientists isolated in a
          laboratory, the pathogen which causes illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Once isolated, scientists take the DNA "guts" out of the

          guts.&nbsp; In other words, they "recombine" the virus with
          harmless yeast guts.&nbsp; <br>
          So the outside of the virus looks like the pathogen making
          people sick, but the guts are harmless yeast.&nbsp; This is
          called a "recombinant" vaccine because they recombined the
          outer virus envelope with harmless yeast DNA guts.<br>
          They reproduce this new harmless "virus" and inject the
          harmless recombinant virus into humans.<br>
          When our body sees the outside of this "invader" it begins its
          immune response and we develop immunity to what the original
          virus LOOKED LIKE on its outside.&nbsp; <br>
          THAT is how old vaccines worked.<br>
          This new COVID-19 vaccine is nothing like the old.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          This new vaccine contains "messenger RNA"&nbsp;
          Ribo-nucleic-acid; a base level of Deoxy-ribonucleic-acid

          It "programs" the human into whom it is injected so that

          It might start re-programming OTHER aspects of human
          DNA.&nbsp; <br>
          In a horrifying possibility, once unleashed, these "messenger

              to penetrate human cells, scientists say</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The ability of the COVID-19 agent to adhere to several
          different receptors at once made the scientists study actively
          to which other types of protein molecules the coronavirus may
          bind and how this affects the course of the disease<br>
          <br>
          Molecular biologists from China have discovered first evidence
          of the fact that the coronavirus penetrates human cells not
          only by using the "lung" ACE2 receptor but also the SR-B1
          receptors which recognize cholesterol molecules. Their
          findings were published in the Nature Metabolism journal.<br>
          <br>
          "Commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection
          suggest that antibodies, peptides and small compounds
          targeting ACE2 can be used in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
          Identifying SR-B1 as a SARS-CoV-2 entry cofactor, we propose
          that drugs that target SR-B1 could act as antivirals that
          limit SARS-CoV-2 infection. As a proof of concept, we have
          shown that ITX 5601, a clinically approved inhibitor of HCV
          infection, strongly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of cultured
          cells," the scientists wrote....<b><br>

          ...Sanford Health published a statement this week announcing
          it had 'mutually agreed to part ways' with longtime CEO Kelby
          Krabbenhoft.<br>
          <br>
          Krabbenhoft leaving after 24 years in the position appeared
          after he sent an email to the company's 50,000 staff last week
          informing them he didn't need to wear a mask because he is
          immune to COVID-19.<br>
          <br>
          'For me to wear a mask defies the efficacy and purpose of a
          mask and sends an untruthful message that I am susceptible to
          infection or could transmit it,' he wrote.<br>
          <br>
          'I have no interest in using masks as a symbolic gesture.<br>
          <br>
          'Masks have been a symbolic issue that frankly frustrates me,'
          Krabbenhoft wrote. 'The 'on-again, off-again' behavior of mask
          use by the general population violates every notion of serious
          infectious management that I was trained to adhere to, so some
          of this is absurd.'<br>
          <br>
          He said he thinks that he is now immune to the virus for 'at
          least seven months and perhaps years to come' and that he
          isn't a threat to transmit it to anyone.'...<b><br>

          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an
          accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes.
          Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been
          associated with pandemics but are still widely overlooked. We
          identify and characterize ORF3d, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2
          that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not other
          closely related pangolin-CoVs or bat-CoVs. We then document
          evidence of ORF3d translation, characterize its protein
          sequence, and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three
          levels: between taxa (21 members of Severe acute respiratory
          syndrome-related coronavirus), between human hosts (3978
          SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within human hosts (401
          deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). ORF3d has been
          independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody
          response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been
          misclassified as the unrelated gene ORF3b, leading to
          confusion. Our results liken ORF3d to other accessory genes in
          emerging viruses and highlight the importance of OLGs.<br>

              Recommendation to Other Public Health Measures to Prevent

              Randomized Controlled Trial</b><br>
            <b>Henning Bundgaard, et al.</b><br>
          </div>
          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Background:<br>
          Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates
          transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
          2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is uncertain if this observed association
          arises through protection of uninfected wearers (protective
          effect), via reduced transmission from infected mask wearers
          (source control), or both.<br>
          Objective:<br>
          To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the
          home reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a
          setting where masks were uncommon and not among recommended
          public health measures.<br>
          Design:<br>
          Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to
          Assess Face Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19
          Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04337541)<br>
          Setting: Denmark, April and May 2020.<br>
          Participants: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day
          outside the home without occupational mask use.<br>
          Intervention: Encouragement to follow social distancing
          measures for coronavirus disease 2019, plus either no mask
          recommendation or a recommendation to wear a mask when outside
          the home among other persons together with a supply of 50
          surgical masks and instructions for proper use.<br>
          Measurements: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in
          the mask wearer at 1 month by antibody testing, polymerase
          chain reaction (PCR), or hospital diagnosis. The secondary
          outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory viruses.<br>
          Results: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned
          to the recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to
          control; 4862 completed the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2
          occurred in 42 participants recommended masks (1.8%) and 53
          control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference was
          −0.3 percentage point (95% CI, −1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P
          = 0.38) (odds ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33).
          Multiple imputation accounting for loss to follow-up yielded
          similar results. Although the difference observed was not
          statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a
          46% reduction to a 23% increase in infection.<br>
          Limitation: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable
          adherence, patient-reported findings on home tests, no
          blinding, and no assessment of whether masks could decrease
          disease transmission from mask wearers to others.<br>
          Conclusion: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to
          supplement other public health measures did not reduce the
          SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by more than 50% in a
          community with modest infection rates, some degree of social
          distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were
          compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection...<br>

          to chase down who, what, where, and with whom COVID positive
          people have had connections: “the tracing component requires

          </div>
          <br>
          Researchers from UCLA and China have found that catalase, a
          naturally occurring enzyme, holds potential as a low-cost
          therapeutic drug to treat COVID-19 symptoms and suppress the
          replication of coronavirus inside the body. A study detailing
          the research was published in Advanced Materials.<br>
          <br>
          Catalase is produced naturally and used by humans, animals and
          plants. Inside cells, the antioxidant enzyme kick starts the
          breakdown of hydrogen peroxide, which can be toxic, into water
          and oxygen. The enzyme is also commonly used worldwide in food
          production and as a dietary supplement...<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          The COVID‐19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people
          worldwide, and there are currently no specific antivirus drugs
          or vaccines. Herein it is a therapeutic based on catalase, an
          antioxidant enzyme that can effectively breakdown hydrogen
          peroxide and minimize the downstream reactive oxygen species,
          which are excessively produced resulting from the infection
          and inflammatory process, is reported. Catalase assists to
          regulate production of cytokines, protect oxidative injury,
          and repress replication of SARS‐CoV‐2, as demonstrated in
          human leukocytes and alveolar epithelial cells, and rhesus
          macaques, without noticeable toxicity. Such a therapeutic can
          be readily manufactured at low cost as a potential treatment
          for COVID‐19...<br>
          <br>
          In conclusion, we have shown the anti‐inflammatory effect and
          ability of catalase to regulate cytokine production in
          leukocytes, protect alveolar cells from oxidative injury, and
          repress the replication of SARS‐CoV‐2 in rhesus macaques
          without noticeable toxicity. Moreover, it is worth noting that
          catalase is safe and commonly used as a food additive and
          dietary supplement, and that pilot‐scale manufacturing of
          n(CAT) has been successfully demonstrated. In contrast to the
          current focus on vaccines and antiviral drugs, this may
          provide an effective therapeutic solution for the pandemic, as
          well as treatment of hyperinflammation in general.<br>

          </b>Top pathologist Dr. Roger Hodkinson told government
          officials in Alberta during a zoom conference call that the
          current coronavirus crisis is “the greatest hoax ever
          perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.”<br>
          <br>
          Hodkinson’s comments were made during a discussion involving
          the Community and Public Services Committee and the clip was
          subsequently uploaded to YouTube.<br>
          <br>
          Noting that he was also an expert in virology, Hodkinson
          pointed out that his role as CEO of a biotech company that
          manufactures COVID tests means, “I might know a little bit
          about all this.”<br>
          <br>
          “There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the

          hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public,” said
          Hodkinson.<br>
          <br>
          The doctor said that nothing could be done to stop the spread
          of the virus besides protecting older more vulnerable people
          and that the whole situation represented “politics playing
          medicine, and that’s a very dangerous game.”..<b><br>

          </div>
          <br>
          The plan subjects U.S. Citizens and residents who are deemed
          “high risk” for Covid-19 to be forcibly removed from their
          families and homes, and involuntarily isolated in guarded
          Camps.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The public first got wind of this impending
          nightmare on May 4, 2020, when Governor Gavin Newson of
          California announced that the “army” – his word – will start
          with a deployment of 3,000 and grow to the 20,000 mark to
          chase down who, what, where, and with whom COVID positive
          people have had connections: “the tracing component requires
          workforce and to identify individuals who tested positive…to
          ID their contacts (with privacy) and maybe quarantine
          individuals to stop the spread of the disease.”<br>
          <br>
          In a video, Robert Levin, MD Health Officer / Medical Director
          of Ventura County, California, elaborated with details about
          the state’s plans — which included the forcible removal of
          people from their homes and the establishment of mass
          community contact tracing...<br>
          <br>
          “There are going to be thousands of people hired who will be
          these contact investigators throughout the state. And this is
          occurring in many, many other states as well — perhaps all the
          states in our country. We will be giving intensive training to
          these people, training not only for identifying and finding
          contacts but also in terms of how to be sensitive about doing
          it.”...<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          A new study reveals the virus triggers production of
          antibodies circulating through the blood, causing clots in
          people hospitalized with the disease...<br>
          <br>
          The culprit: an autoimmune antibody that’s circulating in the
          blood, attacking the cells and triggering clots in arteries,
          veins, and microscopic vessels. Blood clots can cause
          life-threatening events like strokes. And, in COVID-19,
          microscopic clots may restrict blood flow in the lungs,
          impairing oxygen exchange.<br>
          <br>
          Outside of novel coronavirus infection, these clot-causing
          antibodies are typically seen in patients who have the
          autoimmune disease antiphospholipid syndrome. The connection
          between autoantibodies and COVID-19 was unexpected, says
          co-corresponding author Yogen Kanthi, M.D., an assistant
          professor at the Michigan Medicine Frankel Cardiovascular
          Center and a Lasker Investigator at the National Institutes of
          Health’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.<br>
          <br>
          “In patients with COVID-19, we continue to see a relentless,
          self-amplifying cycle of inflammation and clotting in the
          body,” Kanthi says. “Now we’re learning that autoantibodies
          could be a culprit in this loop of clotting and inflammation
          that makes people who were already struggling even sicker.”...<br>

          that emphasize urgency around distinctive effective therapies.
          This study aims to evaluate the anti-parasitic medication
          efficacy "Ivermectin" plus standard care (azithromycin,
          vitamin C, Zinc, Lactoferrin &amp; Acetylcystein &amp;
          prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation if D-dimer &gt;
          1000) in the treatment of mild/moderate and severely ill cases
          with COVID 19 infection, as well as prophylaxis of health care
          and/ or household contacts in comparison to the
          Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment.<b><br>
            <br>
            Subject and methods:</b> 600 subjects; 400 symptomatic
          confirmed COVID-19 patients and 200 health care and household
          contacts distributed over 6 groups; Group I: 100 patients with
          Mild/Moderate COVID-19 infection received a 4-days course of
          Ivermectin plus standard of care; Group II: 100 patients with
          mild/moderate COVID-19 infection received hydroxyxholorquine
          plus standard of care; Group III: 100 patients with severe
          COVID-19 infection received Ivermectin plus standard of care;
          Group IV: 100 patients with Severe COVID-19 infection received
          hydroxyxholorquine plus standard of care. Routine laboratory
          investigations and RT-PCR were reported before and after
          initiation of treatment. Group V stick to personal protective
          equipment (PPE) plus Ivermectin 400mcg / kg to be repeated
          after one week, and Group VI stick to PPE only and both groups
          V&amp;VI were followed for two weeks.<br>
          <b><br>
            Results: </b>Patients received ivermectin reported
          substantial recovery of laboratory investigations; and
          significant reduction in RT-PCR conversion days. A substantial
          improvement and reduction in mortality rate in Ivermectin
          treated groups; group I (mild/moderate cases), (99%, and 0.0%,
          respectively) and group III (severe cases), (94%, and 2.0%,
          respectively) versus hydroxychloroquine plus standard care
          treated groups; group II (mild/moderate cases), (74% and 4%,
          respectively) and group IV (severe cases) (50% and 20%,
          respectively). Ivermectin had significantly reduced the
          incidence of infection in health care and household contacts
          up to 2% compared to 10% in non ivermectin group<br>
          <b><br>
            Conclusion: </b>Addition of Ivermectin to standard care is
          very effective drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients with
          significant reduction in mortality compared to
          Hydroxychloroquine plus standard treatment only. Early use of
          Ivermectin is very useful for controlling COVID 19 infections,
          prophylaxis and improving cytokines storm<br>

          <b><br>
            &nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; PCR tests are not designed to be used
          as a diagnostic tool as they cannot distinguish between
          inactive viruses and “live” or reproductive ones<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amplification over 35 cycles is considered
          unreliable and scientifically unjustified, yet many labs use
          45 cycles. This amplifies any tiny sequence of viral DNA that
          might be present to the point that the test reads “positive”
          even if the viral load is extremely low or the virus is
          inactive<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCR test can also pick up the presence
          of other coronaviruses, so a positive result may simply
          indicate that you’ve recuperated from a common cold in the
          past<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of people are simply carrying
          inactive viral DNA that pose no risk to anyone, yet positive
          test results are being used by the global technocracy to
          implement a brand new economic and social system based on

          </b>“It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute respiratory disease
          (i.e. the flu) with minimal mortality. Why has the whole world
          been destroyed? That I don’t know.”<br>
          <br>
          it is difficult to overstate how important this is. This man
          is the equivalent of Fauci in the US, or perhaps Dr. Deborah
          Birx. The 1.5 hour long interview below is only in Russian,
          but if you can understand it, it is well worth watching,
          because a lot of important information is covered.<br>
          <br>
          The interviewer is Ksenia Sobchak, who is very liberal - think
          of her as like a Russian Rachel Maddow. Like liberals in the
          West, she very much wants to believe the COVID situation is
          much worse than it really is. Myasnikov explains to her in
          detail why it is in fact very difficult to assign 'cause of
          death' in most cases, because there are usually several, in
          addition to a lot of other things.<br>
          <br>
          It is a great interview, in which the good doctor finally
          loses his patience and tells her its not nearly as dangerous
          as people think, and that the whole world has over-reacted. He
          also insists that the death numbers in the West are way
          over-counted.<br>
          <br>
          He's right.<br>
          <br>
          This interview is also a great example of the high level of
          journalism in Russia - this is much more genuine, open,
          exciting, and authentic than most of what is on mainstream
          media in the West. Just watch a few seconds of the intro, and
          you will get the idea.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Russia’s head of coronavirus information
          has suggested that global anxiety over the pandemic is
          misplaced, his latest controversial comment after saying that
          the infection would kill as many people as it needs to.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doctor and television presenter Alexander
          Myasnikov was appointed in April to his new role of informing
          Russians about coronavirus treatment and prevention methods
          and to battle “fake news” about Covid-19. After calling the
          country’s reported low death rate a “Russian miracle,”
          Myasnikov said last week that “those meant to die will die”
          from it.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an interview that aired Wednesday,
          Myasnikov gestured for the cameras to stop running and said
          candidly: “It’s all bullsh*t.”<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “It’s all exaggerated. It’s an acute
          respiratory disease with minimal mortality,” he told
          television personality Ksenia Sobchak in the interview for her
          YouTube project.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Why has the whole world been destroyed?
          That I don’t know,” Myasnikov said, adding that he’s more
          concerned about a second wave that he claimed “we’re
          unprepared for.”<br>

          </div>
          <b><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; PCR tests are not designed to be used
          as a diagnostic tool as they cannot distinguish between
          inactive viruses and “live” or reproductive ones<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amplification over 35 cycles is considered
          unreliable and scientifically unjustified, yet many labs use
          45 cycles. This amplifies any tiny sequence of viral DNA that
          might be present to the point that the test reads “positive”
          even if the viral load is extremely low or the virus is
          inactive<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PCR test can also pick up the presence
          of other coronaviruses, so a positive result may simply
          indicate that you’ve recuperated from a common cold in the
          past<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Millions of people are simply carrying
          inactive viral DNA that pose no risk to anyone, yet positive
          test results are being used by the global technocracy to
          implement a brand new economic and social system based on
          draconian surveillance and totalitarian controls<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Research shows the global lockdown strategy
          harms public health to a greater degree than the virus

              About Vaccination Anti Vaccine</b><b> -- Eleanor McBean</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          During the Dark Ages, before the introduction of improved
          nutrition and sanitation, the world was intermittently visited
          with epidemics of smallpox. The cause was stubbornly ignored
          and<br>
          the seeds for more disease were sown when vaccination was
          brought into popular use. This infusion of poison injected
          into the blood stream of the masses only served to intensify
          the<br>
          disease in some cases, suppress the symptoms in others and
          create new and more serious diseases in still others. So, with
          the passing of years we have seen this misbegotten child of<br>
          ignorance grow into a Frankenstein monster of immense
          proportions that moves relentlessly forward, grinding under
          foot the multitudes that throng its path<br>
          <br>
          Through the lethal power of this poisoned needle, the simple
          zymotic (contagious) diseases of the past have been devolved
          into the horrors of the present — our terrifying and expanding
          crop of "killer diseases". Many of these strange "mystery
          diseases" that baffle the entire medical world, are the sordid
          products of vaccine poisons that disturb the chemical balance
          of the body and interfere with normal functioning.<br>
          <br>
          All these medically-made atrocities are far worse than
          smallpox or any of the other eruptive diseases that nature
          provides as a means of expelling the accumulated poison waste
          from the abused body. This interference with the balanced
          economy of nature has multiplied the&nbsp; Problems beyond the
          power of science to control.<br>
          <br>
          Our worst epidemics now are epidemics of vaccination in which
          more people are killed every year by "vaccinal diseases" than
          by the diseases that the vaccinations were supposed to combat.<br>
          <br>
          Complete freedom from disease can scarcely be found except in
          remote islands or isolated communities that have not been
          invaded by medical mischief and commercialized products. Is
          our proud civilization to be degraded, corrupted, and
          destroyed by its own inventions designed for selfish profit
          and exploitation of the race?<br>
          <br>
          Vaccination, instead of being the promised blessing to the
          world, has proved to be a curse of such sweeping devastation
          that it has caused more death and disease than war,
          pestilence, and plague combined. There is no scourge (with the
          possible exception of atomic radiation) that is more
          destructive to our nation’s health than this monument of human
          deception — this slayer of the innocent —this crippler of body
          and brain<br>

          <div align="center"><b>&nbsp;My research into the NCBI
              database for nucleotide sequences has lead to a stunning
              discovery. <br>

              SARS-CoV-2 is found in all human DNA!</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The sequence “CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT” is an 18-character primer
          sequence found in the WHO coronavirus PCR testing protocol
          document. The primer sequences are what get amplified by the
          PCR process in order to be detected and designated a
          “positive” test result. It just so happens this exact same
          18-character sequence, verbatim, is also found on Homo sapiens
          chromosome 8! As far as I can tell, this means that the WHO
          test kits should find a positive result in all humans. Can
          anyone explain this otherwise?...<br>
          <br>
          Update: After some effort, I have finally discovered a way to
          display proof (beyond my screenshots) that human chromosome 8
          has this exact same 18-character sequence. Please try the link

            <b>By Jon Rappoport</b><br>

          <br>
          In major media, certain stories gain traction. The trumpets
          keep blaring for a time before they fade.<br>
          <br>
          Other stories are one-offs. A few of them strike hard. Their
          implications—if anyone stops to think about them—are powerful.
          Then…nothing.<br>
          <br>
          “Wait, aren’t you going to follow up on that? Don’t you see
          what that MEANS?”<br>
          <br>
          Apparently not, because…dead silence. “In other news, the
          governor lost his pet parakeet for an hour. His chief of staff
          found it taking a nap in a desk drawer…”<br>
          <br>
          One-offs function like teasers. You definitely want to know
          more, but you never get more.<br>
          <br>
          Over the years, I’ve tried to follow up on a few. The reporter
          or the editor has a set of standard replies: “We didn’t get
          much feedback.” “We covered it.” “It’s now old news.” “There
          wasn’t anything else to find out.”<br>
          <br>
          Oh, but there WAS.<br>
          <br>
          A few weeks ago, I ran a one-off. The analysis and commentary
          were mine, but the story was an opinion piece in the New York
          Times. The Times called it an opinion piece to soften its
          blow. I suspected it would disappear, and it did.<br>
          <br>
          Its meaning and implication were too strong. It would be a
          vast embarrassment for the White House, the Warp Speed COVID
          vaccine program, the vaccine manufacturers, the coronavirus
          task force, and vaccine researchers.<br>
          <br>
          And embarrassment would be just the beginning of their
          problem.<br>
          <br>
          So…here it is again. The vanished one-off, back in business:<br>
          <br>
          COVID vaccine clinical trials doomed to fail; fatal design
          flaw; NY Times opinion piece exposes all three major clinical
          trials. [2]<br>
          <br>
          Peter Doshi, associate editor of the medical journal BMJ, and
          Eric Topol, Scripps Research professor of molecular medicine,
          have written a devastating NY Times opinion piece about the
          ongoing COVID vaccine clinical trials.<br>
          <br>
          They expose the fatal flaw in the large Pfizer, AstraZeneca,
          and Moderna trials.<br>
          <br>
          September 22, the Times: “These Coronavirus Trials Don’t
          Answer the One Question We Need to Know” [1]:<br>
          <br>
          “If you were to approve a coronavirus vaccine, would you
          approve one that you only knew protected people only from the
          most mild form of Covid-19, or one that would prevent its
          serious complications?”<br>
          <br>
          “The answer is obvious. You would want to protect against the
          worst cases.”<br>
          <br>
          “But that’s not how the companies testing three of the leading
          coronavirus vaccine candidates, Moderna, Pfizer and
          AstraZeneca, whose U.S. trial is on hold, are approaching the
          problem.”<br>
          <br>
          “According to the protocols for their studies, which they
          released late last week, a vaccine could meet the companies’
          benchmark for success if it lowered the risk of mild Covid-19,
          but was never shown to reduce moderate or severe forms of the
          disease, or the risk of hospitalization, admissions to the
          intensive care unit or death.”<br>
          <br>
          “To say a vaccine works should mean that most people no longer
          run the risk of getting seriously sick. That’s not what these
          trials will determine.”<br>
          <br>
          This means these clinical trials are dead in the water.<br>
          <br>
          The trials are designed to show effectiveness in preventing
          mild cases of COVID, which nobody should care about, because
          mild cases naturally run their course and cause no harm. THERE
          IS NO NEED FOR A VACCINE THAT PREVENTS MILD CASES.<br>
          <br>
          There. That’s the NY Times one-off. My piece analyzing it went
          on much longer, but you get the main thrust:<br>
          <br>
          The leading vaccine clinical trials are useless, irrelevant,
          misleading, and deceptive.<br>
          <br>
          But now, it gets much worse. Because Pfizer has just announced
          their vaccine is almost ready. CNBC headline, November 9:
          “Pfizer, BioNTech say Covid vaccine is more than 90%
          effective—‘great day for science and humanity’” [3].<br>
          <br>
          And not a peep about the NY Times one-off. That’s gone, as if
          it never was.<br>
          <br>
          Trump’s coronavirus task force knows the truth. Biden’s new
          task force, waiting in the wings, knows the truth. But they
          don’t care. They’re criminals. They’d sell a car with a gas
          tank ready to explode to a customer with cash.<br>
          <br>
          But you care, because you can read and think.<br>
          <br>
          You can raise hell.<br>
          <br>
          Now, in case anyone is interested in knowing WHY the major
          clinical trials of the COVID vaccine are designed only to
          prevent mild cases of COVID, I’ll explain.<br>
          <br>
          A vaccine maker assumes that, during the course of the
          clinical trial, a few of the 30,000 volunteers are going to
          “catch COVID-19.”<br>
          <br>
          They assume this because “the virus is everywhere,” as far as
          they’re concerned. So it’ll drop down from the clouds and
          infect a few of the volunteers.<br>
          <br>
          The magic number is 150. When that number of volunteers “catch
          COVID,” everything stops. The clinical trial stops.<br>
          <br>
          At this point, the vaccine maker hopes that most of the
          volunteers who “got infected” are in the placebo group. They
          didn’t receive the real vaccine; they received the saltwater
          placebo shot.<br>
          <br>
          Then the vaccine maker can proudly say, “See? The volunteers
          who caught COVID-19? Most of them didn’t receive the vaccine.
          They weren’t protected. The volunteers who received the real
          vaccine didn’t catch COVID. The vaccine protected them.”<br>
          <br>
          Actually, the number split the vaccine makers are looking for
          is 50 and 100. If 50 people in the vaccine group catch COVID,
          and 100 in the placebo group catch COVID, the vaccine is said
          to be 50% effective. And that’s all the vaccine maker needs to
          win FDA approval for the vaccine.<br>
          <br>
          But wait. Let’s look closer at this idea of “catching COVID.”
          What are they really talking about? How do they define that?
          Claiming a volunteer in the clinical trial caught COVID adds
          up to what?<br>
          <br>
          Does it add up to a minimal definition of COVID-19—a cough, or
          chills and fever? Or does it mean a serious case—severe
          pneumonia?<br>
          <br>
          Now we come to the hidden factor, the secret, the source of
          the whole con game.<br>
          <br>
          You see, the vaccine maker starts out with 30,000 HEALTHY
          volunteers. So, if they waited for 150 of them to come down
          with severe pneumonia, a serious case of COVID, how long do
          you think that would take? Five years? Ten years?<br>
          <br>
          The vaccine maker can’t possibly wait that long.<br>
          <br>
          These 150 COVID cases the vaccine maker is looking for would
          be mild. Just a cough. Or chills and fever. That scenario
          would only take a few months to develop. And face it, chills,
          cough, and fever aren’t unique to COVID. Anyone can come down
          with those symptoms.<br>
          <br>
          THEREFORE, THE WHOLE CLINICAL TRIAL IS DESIGNED, UP FRONT, TO
          FIND 150 CASES OF MILD AND MEANINGLESS AND SELF-CURING
          “COVID.”<br>
          <br>
          About which, no one cares. No one should care.<br>
          <br>
          But, as we see, Pfizer is trumpeting their clinical trial of
          the vaccine as a landmark in human history.<br>
          <br>
          And THAT’S the story of the one-off the NY Times didn’t think
          was worth a second glance.<br>
          <br>
          Because they’re so stupid? No. They’re not that stupid.<br>
          <br>
          They’re criminals.<br>
          <br>
          And the government wants you to take the experimental COVID
          vaccine, whose “effectiveness” was designed to prevent nothing
          worth losing a night’s sleep over.<br>
          <br>
          The only worry are the adverse effects of the vaccine, about
          which I’ve written extensively. These effects include,
          depending on what’s in the vial, a permanent alteration of
          your genetic makeup, or an auto-immune cascade, in which the
          body attacks itself.<br>

          effect is much worse. A dose of mercury sufficient to kill 1%
          of tested rats, when combined with a dose of lead sufficient
          to kill less than 1% of rats, resulted in killing 100% of rats

          <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
          </b>Cost-effective, efficacious therapeutics are urgently
          needed against the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we used camelid
          immunization and proteomics to identify a large repertoire of
          highly potent neutralizing nanobodies (Nbs) to the SARS-CoV-2
          spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). We discovered
          Nbs with picomolar to femtomolar affinities that inhibit viral
          infection at sub-ng/ml concentration and determined a
          structure of one of the most potent in complex with RBD.
          Structural proteomics and integrative modeling revealed
          multiple distinct and non-overlapping epitopes and indicated
          an array of potential neutralization mechanisms. We
          constructed multivalent Nb constructs that achieved ultrahigh
          neutralization potency (IC50s as low as 0.058 ng/ml) and may
          prevent mutational escape. These thermostable Nbs can be
          rapidly produced in bulk from microbes and resist
          lyophilization, and aerosolization.<br>

              Medicine to Fight Against the Novel Coronavirus COVID-19</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          A story titled "Delhi-based institute claims to 'cure'
          COVID-19 through cosmic sound therapy" was forwarded to me on
          a Telegram group.&nbsp; This article aroused my interest and
          attention because I have been looking for a method of
          treatment using vibrational frequencies to breakdown the novel
          coronavirus Covid-19 through resonance effect.<br>
          <br>
          This article was written by Somrita Ghosh, and was published
          on the New Indian Express on July 4, 2020, with a subtitle
          "Vibrational frequencies of coronavirus and two enzymes were
          decoded, and since each of them have different frequencies,
          the three sound waves have been designed to deal with each of
          them."<br>
          <br>
          It writes about the promising results shown using vibrational
          frequencies for patients with the novel coronavirus Covid-19
          at the Human Energy Research Centre in India. It is said that
          the therapy is based on the ancient Vedic philosophy that "the
          entire universe is eternally in a state of subtle vibrations."
          Thus, if the vibrational frequencies of the novel coronavirus
          and its related enzymes are able to be decoded, then one can
          cause resonance effect to break their structures, as "the
          virus, which has a protein cell layer, starts vibrating and
          therefore the chemical bond breaks down. The virus cannot
          sustain beyond a certain energy level," according to the team.
          <br>
          <br>
          With volunteer patients who continued their routine
          medications, the team conducted a trial in May 2020, and
          promising results were shown.<br>
          <br>
          During the hour-long sound therapy, the patients are made to
          listen sounds with three different frequencies stage-wise.
          Each stage has a duration of seven minutes and there’s a gap
          of five minutes between each stage. Four to six sessions in a
          span of two-three days are required to complete the course.<br>
          <br>
          According to the news article, the therapy was developed by Dr
          Ramesh Vaish, Ikwan Onwuka, and Dr Harsh Rastogi...<br>

          <b>My Research Summary And Results</b><br>
          Concerning COVID-19, I have been collecting bioinformatics
          data since December 2019. With these, I have done several
          calculations involving the Energy equations of Quantum
          Physics. Virus particles or virions are quantum entities. As
          such, they display wave-particle duality and obey the laws of
          Quantum Mechanics. The calculations were aimed at establishing
          Energy, Frequency and Vibrational relationships between
          SARS-CoV-2 and the potential therapeutic drugs.<br>
          <br>
          I have analyzed the Genome sequence of the original
          Wuhan-virus, the genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
          obtained from the first COVID-19 patient quarantined in my
          home country. In addition, I examined the bioinformatics of
          the two major enzymes responsible for the replication and
          transcription of the virus in infected humans – the
          RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RdRp) and the Protease. Also
          included in my analyses are some of the drugs that have
          received pre-trial approval for treating COVID-19. These are:
          Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Indinavir, Indinavir Hydrate,
          Lopinavir and Favipiravir.<br>
          <br>
          The outcome of my analyses shows, for sure, that there are
          coherent Frequency and Vibrational connections between all the
          factors I evaluated. This relationship became very obvious
          when I applied the Octave rule and translated the frequencies
          into their equivalents within the 12-band chromatic scale of
          western musicology. The equal-tempered chromatic scale
          simulates quantization within the audible sound range of the
          electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
          <br>
          A very striking observation was that the frequencies of the
          protein enzymes (Polymerase and Protease) which aid
          replication and transcription of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has a
          unique harmonic relationship, musically speaking. One was a
          perfect fifth of the other. Wondering if that was mere
          coincidence, I decided to check for a similar musical
          relationship between the Polymerase and Protease of another
          well-known virus. The easy pick was HIV-1 virus and when I ran
          my frequency calculations, the same harmonic relationship
          showed up between HIV-1 polymerase and protease.<br>
          <br>
          The most pleasant surprise came when I translated the
          frequency values I got for the potential COVID-19 drugs
          (Remdesivir, Chloroquine, Indinavir, Indinavir Hydrate,
          Lopinavir, and Favipiravir) into their octave equivalents
          within the quantized chromatic scale. I found that every one
          of these drug frequencies matched the frequency of the
          protease. The only exception was the frequency of Remdesivir,
          which matched the natural frequency of SARS-CoV-2, the
          COVID-19 virion...0<br>

          <b>The Pattern</b><br>
          By matching the frequencies/quantized audio bandwidth of the
          drugs to those of the virus and its enzyme proteins, an
          interesting pattern emerges. One could see why and how these
          drugs, discounting their side-effects, might be effective
          against COVID-19.<br>
          <br>
          With the exception of Remdesivir, the frequency of all the
          drugs I analyzed fall within the quantized bandwidth of Key
          A#/Bb. This matches the bandwidth of the virus’ Protease.
          Therefore, the mechanism of action of these drugs will have
          more to do with protease inhibition, irrespective of the
          target they were originally developed for.<br>
          <br>
          None of the drugs I analyzed matched the Polymerase in
          frequency or quantized bandwidth...<br>
          <br>
          <b>The Energy-Frequency-Vibration (EFV) Model</b><br>
          Viewed from the paradigm of Energy, Frequency and Vibration,
          it is evident that the action of Remdesivir against SARS-CoV-2
          results from the affinity between its vibrational frequency
          and that of the virus particle. Likewise, the effects of the
          other drugs evaluated here can be interpreted satisfactorily
          in terms of Energy, Frequency, and Vibration.<br>
          <br>
          As an example, the mechanism of action of Remdesivir can be
          explained by the principle of RESONANCE. The drug molecules
          sets up a vibration at its natural frequency. This vibration
          induces resonance in the virus molecule since both molecules
          have the same natural frequency. As a result of induced
          resonance vibration, the virus molecule self-amplifies. If the
          induced resonance and amplification is sustained, the energy
          generated within the virus molecule pushes towards a fatal
          threshold. Beyond this threshold, the chemical bonds of the
          virus molecule are broken leading to the inactivation of the
          virus molecule.<br>
          <br>
          The same phenomenon of induced resonance explains the
          inhibition effect of the remaining drugs under study.
          Resonance, therefore, is the mechanism of action of all these
          therapeutic compounds. And resonance is a function of energy,
          frequency, and vibration.<br>
          <br>
          Scientific evidence supports the application of resonance in
          breaking of chemical bonds and inactivation of Chromosome DNA
          and RNA molecules<b> : </b><b>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7088816</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          <b>The EFV Alternative To Drugs And Vaccines?</b><br>
          Each of the drugs (Chloroquine, Indinavir, Lopinavir,
          Favipiravir) analyzed here are made from unique combinations
          of elements. Although they all are potential treatment agents
          for COVID-19, no two of them are the same in composition. This
          clearly shows that the drugs’ effectiveness is dependent on a
          factor other than elemental composition. This secondary
          factor, which I have shown to be the natural/resonant
          frequency of the drugs, is the common working principle. In
          other words, the drugs have effects on the virus mainly
          because they vibrate at a certain frequency...<br>
          <br>
          <b>The End of COVID-19</b><br>
          I have designed three sound samples for auditory stimulation,
          based on the three target resonant frequencies. Each of these
          samples is a composite of ten pure sinusoidal tones. All ten
          tones are octave related and fall within the audio range of
          the electromagnetic spectrum.<br>
          <br>
          The actual values, in Hertz, for the resonant frequencies, are
          higher than the audible range. But, I comfortably employed
          their audible octaves because of the law of Octaves. In
          dealing with sound, and any electromagnetic wave,
          frequency-wise, an octave can be used to the same effect as
          the frequency itself.<br>
          <br>
          To enhance brainwave entrainment, each of the composite
          auditory stimulus sounds is pulsed into isochronic beats. The
          frequency of the isochronic beat is a much lower octave of the
          target resonant frequency. I chose the delta brainwave region.<br>
          <br>
          These isochronic sounds are tuned to the resonant frequencies
          associated with SARS-CoV-2 Genome ID: MN908947, the
          coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Listening to these sounds
          will ENTRAIN the brain and cause it to produce a SENSORY
          EVOKED RESPONSE, which is an electrical potential mimicking
          the frequency of this sound stimulus. This electrical
          potential is propagated through the central nervous system,
          CNS, and the peripheral nervous system, PNS, to every cell in
          the human organism. Should there be SARS-CoV-2 in the body
          system, as is the case with COVID-19 victims, the virus will
          VIBRATE in RESONANCE with the incident frequency. Such
          resonance vibration causes the virus particle to
          uncontrollably absorb energy to a point where it’s chemical
          bonds are broken and the virus inactivated.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Instructions:</b><b><br>
          </b>Make sure you are well hydrated before listening to any of
          the sounds. Listen to each 7 minutes track, 3 times with 20
          minutes intervals. That means you’d spend approximately 61
          minutes on each track. Please adhere to this instruction,
          especially for first-time use. It is preferable to listen to
          headphones but not compulsory. When you are done with the
          first track, give yourself a few hours before listening to the
          second track. You don’t need to listen to all the tracks in
          one stretch. If you are not infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus,
          the sounds will target other pathogens with resonant
          frequencies close to that of SAR-CoV-2. There are no
          significant side-effects except for slight fatigue, which
          usually occurs when a large number of parasites, bacteria and
          viruses are killed in the body.<br>

          <br>
          All five frequencies play once. But instead of having 5
          minutes interval of silence between the frequencies, I
          inserted a musical composition which I recently produced using
          a musical equivalent of the frequencies I obtained from
          computational proteomic analysis of the genes associated with

          at least once a day for at least 5 days.<br>
          2. Since the therapy is non-invasive and well-tolerated by

              COVID-19 through cosmic sound therapy</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          Vibrational frequencies of coronavirus and two enzymes were
          decoded, and since each of them have different frequencies,
          the three sound waves have been designed to deal with each of
          them.<br>
          <br>
          The Human Energy Research Centre — an organisation based on
          Public-Private Engagement model — in the national capital has
          claimed to have found a way to cure the COVID-19 by using an
          extraordinary sound therapy, electro-frequency vibration.<br>
          <br>
          The therapy, developed by Dr Ramesh Vaish, Ikwan Onwuka and Dr
          Harsh Rastogi, is claimed to be based on the principle derived
          from the ancient Vedic philosophy that the entire universe is
          eternally in a state of subtle vibrations called cosmic sound.
          Combining this knowledge with the principles of quantum theory
          applicable to a wave, the experts developed three sound waves.
          <br>
          <br>
          Vibrational frequencies of coronavirus and two enzymes were
          decoded, and since each of them have different frequencies,
          the three sound waves have been designed to deal with each of
          them.<br>
          <br>
          “This sound therapy is completely harmless, drug-free and does
          not have any side-effects. There is a lot of physics involved
          in this technique; it is not a medical process. The sound
          waves will attack the virus and create resonance. The virus,
          which has a protein cell layer, starts vibrating and therefore
          the chemical bond breaks down. The virus cannot sustain beyond
          a certain energy level,” said Dr Vaish.<br>
          <br>
          A trial was conducted in May on some symptomatic patients in
          home isolation, who volunteered for it. Along with the
          therapy, the patients continued their medicinal routine.
          According to Dr Vaish, the patients showed improvement within
          days.<br>
          <br>
          “After promising results, we pitched the idea to some
          hospitals to implement it on interested patients. Some private
          hospitals have agreed and one is likely to start it in two
          days,” he&nbsp; said. <br>
          <br>
          The researches claimed that since this therapy doesn’t involve
          any medical treatment and was to be provided to patients on
          voluntary basis, any approval from a regulatory authority
          wasn’t required.<br>
          <br>
          However, they claimed to have informed the Delhi government
          and received a go-ahead from health minister Satyendar Jain.<br>
          <br>
          During the hour-long therapy, the patients are made to listen
          three different sounds — including Gayatri Mantra and Maha
          Mrityunjay Mantra — stage-wise. Each stage has a duration of
          seven minutes and there’s a gap of five minutes between each
          stage. Four to six sessions in a span of two-three days are
          required to complete the course.<br>
          <br>
          They have approached the Health and AYUSH Ministries to
          implement the therapy on a regular basis and larger scale.<br>
          <br>
          “If approved, it will be the first of its kind in the world.
          We’ve come to know that a US institute is working on the same
          concept,” he said. <br>

              Facts About Vaccination Anti Vaccine</b><br>
            <b>Eleanor McBean<br>
              <br>
            </b></div>
          During the Dark Ages, before the introduction of improved
          nutrition and sanitation, the world was intermittently visited
          with epidemics of smallpox. The cause was stubbornly ignored
          and the seeds for more disease were sown when vaccination was
          brought into popular use. This infusion of poison injected
          into the blood stream of the masses only served to intensify
          the disease in some cases, suppress the symptoms in others and
          create new and more serious diseases in still others. So, with
          the passing of years we have seen this misbegotten child of
          ignorance grow into a Frankenstein monster of immense
          proportions that moves relentlessly forward, grinding under
          foot the multitudes that throng its path.<br>
          Through the lethal power of this poisoned needle, the simple
          zymotic (contagious) diseases of the past have been devolved
          into the horrors of the present — our terrifying and expanding
          crop of "killer diseases". Many of these strange "mystery
          diseases" that baffle the entire medical world, are the sordid
          products of vaccine poisons that disturb the chemical balance
          of the body and interfere with normal functioning.<br>
          All these medically-made atrocities are far worse than
          smallpox or any of the other eruptive diseases that nature
          provides as a means of expelling the accumulated poison waste
          from the abused body. This interference with the balanced
          economy of nature has multiplied the problems beyond the power
          of science to control.<br>
          Our worst epidemics now are epidemics of vaccination in which
          more people are killed every year by "vaccinal diseases" than
          by the diseases that the vaccinations were supposed to combat.<br>
          Complete freedom from disease can scarcely be found except in
          remote islands or isolated communities that have not been
          invaded by medical mischief and commercialized products. Is<br>
          our proud civilization to be degraded, corrupted, and
          destroyed by its own inventions designed for selfish profit
          and exploitation of the race?<br>
          Vaccination, instead of being the promised blessing to the
          world, has proved to be a curse of such sweeping devastation
          that it has caused more death and disease than war,
          pestilence, and plague combined. There is no scourge (with the
          possible exception of atomic radiation) that is more
          destructive to our nation’s health than this monument of human
          deception — this slayer of the innocent —this crippler of body
          and brain<br>

          A study involving more than 5,000 COVID-19 patients in Houston
          finds that the virus that causes the disease is accumulating
          genetic mutations, one of which may have made it more
          contagious. According to the paper published in the
          peer-reviewed journal mBIO, that mutation, called D614G, is
          located in the spike protein that pries open our cells for
          viral entry. It’s the largest peer-reviewed study of
          SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences in one metropolitan region of the
          U.S. to date.<br>
          <br>
          The paper shows “the virus is mutating due to a combination of
          neutral drift — which just means random genetic changes that
          don’t help or hurt the virus — and pressure from our immune
          systems,” said Ilya Finkelstein, associate professor of
          molecular biosciences at The University of Texas at Austin and
          co-author of the study. The study was carried out by
          scientists at Houston Methodist Hospital, UT Austin and
          elsewhere.<br>
          <br>
          During the initial wave of the pandemic, 71% of the novel
          coronaviruses identified in patients in Houston had this
          mutation. When the second wave of the outbreak hit Houston
          during the summer, this variant had leaped to 99.9%
          prevalence. This mirrors a trend observed around the world. A
          study published in July based on more than 28,000 genome
          sequences found that variants carrying the D614G mutation
          became the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2 in about a
          month. SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19....<b><br>

          ...Excess mortality rate was limited to a very short period of
          time, which make nonsense of the virus hypothesis<br>
          <br>
          Sure, some countries recorded noticeably more deaths in the
          first half of 2020 than in previous years. This holds
          especially for Italy, Spain, France, England, Belgium, the
          Netherlands and the USA. However, the hypothesis that a new,
          potentially deadly corona virus would have raged in these
          countries is already contradicted by the fact that these
          states in particular pursued a rigid lockdown policy.
          Therefore, following the logic of the virus, they should have
          had fewer deaths.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, Belgium, for example, had eight times more deaths
          (per 100,000 inhabitants) than its neighbour Germany, Spain 22
          times more than Poland, while Portugal, Spain’s direct
          neighbour, did not experience any excess mortality. But a
          virus pandemic, which afflicts countries so differently,
          cannot actually exist, especially in today’s times....<br>

          a high number of tests and time pressure after recording 58
          out of 60 false positives in a week.<br>
          <br>
          Gabriele Schoen, Managing Director of the Labor Augsburg MVZ
          laboratory, told Munich’s daily newspaper Muenchener Merkur
          that it’s not possible for them to constantly “double check”
          tests when they provided a positive result”, as they were
          under pressure and working with a “lack of equipment”.<br>
          <br>
          The laboratory was found to have wrongly diagnosed 58 out of
          60 coronavirus tests it identified as positive during a

                </b>&nbsp;Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says his
                country has designed “a highly effective antiviral” that
                decimates coronavirus without any side effects. The drug
                will be presented to the WHO for certification, he
                added.<br>
                <br>
                "I want to say that Venezuela has developed a medicine
                that annihilates 100 percent of the coronavirus," Maduro
                said on Sunday, describing it as a “highly effective
                antiviral.”<br>
                <br>
                It was designed by the Venezuelan Institute for
                Scientific Research (IVIC), which has been working on a
                cure for the virus for the past six months, he noted.<br>
                <br>
                The medicine is based on a molecule called TR-10, which
                was isolated and, when pitted against the virus, proved
                its absolute effectiveness, he claimed.<br>
                <br>
                Maduro said the study has already been reviewed by
                experts and scientists, and will be presented to the
                World Health Organization (WHO) so that it can certify
                its findings. <br>
                <br>
                As he touted the potential breakthrough in Covid-19
                therapy, Maduro said Venezuela looks forward “to
                offering this treatment to the world,” congratulating
                the IVIC on “this great contribution to humanity.” Mass
                production of the drug will be facilitated through
                “international alliances,” he said, without elaborating.<br>
                <br>
                The newly-developed drug is completely safe, the
                institute claimed, insisting it “does not affect healthy
                molecules in the body” and does not result in any side
                effects. <br>
                <br>
                The studies were conducted on virus cells isolated from
                Venezuelan coronavirus patients, Gabriela Jiménez, the
                minister of science and technology, said.<br>
                <br>
                The molecule is an ursolic acid derivative, which “has
                shown 100 percent inhibition of virus replication in
                vitro [outside of a living organism],” she said, as

                <b>Abstract</b><br>
                There were 3 influenza pandemics in the 20th century,
                and there has been 1 so far in the 21st century. Local,
                national, and international health authorities regularly
                update their plans for mitigating the next influenza
                pandemic in light of the latest available evidence on
                the effectiveness of various control measures in
                reducing transmission. Here, we review the evidence base
                on the effectiveness of nonpharmaceutical personal
                protective measures and environmental hygiene measures
                in nonhealthcare settings and discuss their potential
                inclusion in pandemic plans. Although mechanistic
                studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or
                face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled
                trials of these measures did not support a substantial
                effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed
                influenza. We similarly found limited evidence on the
                effectiveness of improved hygiene and environmental
                cleaning. We identified several major knowledge gaps
                requiring further research, most fundamentally an
                improved characterization of the modes of
                person-to-person transmission...<br>
                <br>
                <b>Discussion</b><br>
                In this review, we did not find evidence to support a
                protective effect of personal protective measures or
                environmental measures in reducing influenza
                transmission. Although these measures have mechanistic
                support based on our knowledge of how influenza is
                transmitted from person to person, randomized trials of
                hand hygiene and face masks have not demonstrated
                protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza, with
                1 exception (18). We identified only 2 RCTs on
                environmental cleaning and no RCTs on cough etiquette.<br>
                <br>
                Hand hygiene is a widely used intervention and has been
                shown to effectively reduce the transmission of
                gastrointestinal infections and respiratory infections
                (26). However, in our systematic review, updating the
                findings of Wong et al. (8), we did not find evidence of
                a major effect of hand hygiene on laboratory-confirmed
                influenza virus transmission (Figure 1). Nevertheless,
                hand hygiene might be included in influenza pandemic
                plans as part of general hygiene and infection
                prevention.<br>
                <br>
                We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks
                are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza
                transmission, either when worn by infected persons
                (source control) or by persons in the general community
                to reduce their susceptibility (Figure 2). However, as
                with hand hygiene, face masks might be able to reduce
                the transmission of other infections and therefore have
                value in an influenza pandemic when healthcare resources
                are stretched.<br>
                <br>
                It is essential to note that the mechanisms of
                person-to-person transmission in the community have not
                been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role
                of transmission through fine-particle aerosols (3,46).
                Transmission by indirect contact requires transfer of
                viable virus from respiratory mucosa onto hands and
                other surfaces, survival on those surfaces, and
                successful inoculation into the respiratory mucosa of
                another person. All of these components of the
                transmission route have not been studied extensively.
                The impact of environmental factors, such as temperature
                and humidity, on influenza transmission is also
                uncertain (47). These uncertainties over basic
                transmission modes and mechanisms hinder the
                optimization of control measures.<br>
                <br>
                In this review, we focused on 3 personal protective
                measures and 1 environmental measure. Other potential
                environmental measures include humidification in dry
                environments (48), increasing ventilation (49), and use
                of upper-room UV light (50), but there is limited
                evidence to support these measures. Further
                investigations on the effectiveness of respiratory
                etiquette and surface cleaning through conducting RCTs
                would be helpful to provide evidence with higher
                quality; evaluation of the effectiveness of these
                measures targeting specific population groups, such as
                immunocompromised persons, would also be beneficial
                (Table 2). Future cost-effectiveness evaluations could
                provide more support for the potential use of these
                measures. Further research on transmission modes and
                alternative interventions to reduce influenza
                transmission would be valuable in improving pandemic
                preparedness. Finally, although our review focused on
                nonpharmaceutical measures to be taken during influenza
                pandemics, the findings could also apply to severe
                seasonal influenza epidemics. Evidence from RCTs of hand
                hygiene or face masks did not support a substantial
                effect on transmission of laboratory-confirmed
                influenza, and limited evidence was available on other
                environmental measures.<br>

                different way even if they use the same main receptor
                ACE2,” says University of Helsinki virologist Ravi Ojha.<br>
                <br>
                Researchers from the Technical University of Munich in
                Germany and the University of Helsinki in Finland
                examined the virus’ spiky coating under an electron
                microscope and compared the genomes of the two viruses.<br>
                <br>
                They found that the novel coronavirus had ‘learned a new
                trick,’ so to speak, picking up a kind of ‘hook’ used by
                other nasty pathogens like Ebola, HIV and avian flu, to
                latch onto human tissues more aggressively. <br>
                <br>
                They discovered that the coronavirus uses this
                ‘grappling hook’ on the receptor neuropilin-1, which
                lines the nerve tissues inside the human nasal cavity. <br>
                <br>
                To confirm their suspicions, the researchers then
                deployed monoclonal antibodies (an antibody made by
                cloning white blood cells), which they engineered to
                block access to neuropilin-1. <br>
                <br>
                They then introduced ‘pseudoviruses,’ designed to mimic
                SARS-CoV-2 behaviors but without any of the intense
                self-replication properties, which found it far more
                difficult to infect cells when the neuropilin-1 was
                blocked.<br>
                <br>
                “If you think of ACE2 as a door lock to enter the cell,
                then neuropilin-1 could be a factor that directs the
                virus to the door,” says Balistreri. <br>
                <br>
                Given the density of neuropilin-1 along nerve tissues in
                the human nasal cavity, it essentially acts as a
                welcoming party for SARS-CoV-2 which then only needs to
                flash its ACE2 before it can engage in a free-for-all
                inside the human body, with destructive consequences
                witnessed the world over. <br>
                <br>
                Experiments on mice confirmed the receptor’s role in the
                virus gaining access to their nervous system, though a
                direct link to the traumatic damage witnessed on human
                brains after severe Covid-19 has yet to be properly
                studied. <br>
                <br>
                “We could determine that neuropilin-1, at least under
                the conditions of our experiments, promotes transport
                into the brain, but we cannot make any conclusion
                whether this is also true for SARS-CoV-2,” says
                neurologist Mika Simons from the Technical University of
                Munich.<br>
                <br>
                The researchers have begun exploring ways to interrupt
                the connection between the virus and neuropilin-1, with
                a view to making it less infectious, with promising
                early results and laboratory tests already underway.<br>

                that blood type O is something of a security blanket
                when it comes to coronavirus. Those with this blood type

                also had a reduced risk of suffering severe
                complications if they do get sick.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                However, people with types A and AB were not so lucky,
                as scientists found that they were more likely to suffer
                more severely than people from the other two blood
                groups (O and B). Blood groups are defined by their
                numbers of antigen and antibody proteins. Type O is the

                release of SARS-CoV-2from the Wuhan Institute of
                Virology. Fauci continues to cover for the Chineseand

                    While SARS-CoV-2 is a rampant virus that can cause
                    severe problems in vulnerable individuals, the real
                    pandemic - the underlying cause that makes people
                    susceptible to complications from the infection in
                    the first place - is poor metabolic health<br>
                    <br>
                    Aside from old age, obesity has been identified as
                    one of the primary risk factors for being
                    hospitalized with COVID-19 - doubling the risk of
                    hospitalization in patients under the age of 60 in
                    one study&nbsp; <br>
                    <br>
                    One hypothesis for why obesity is worsening COVID-19
                    has to do with the fact that obesity causes chronic
                    inflammation. Having more pro-inflammatory cytokines
                    in circulation increases your risk of experiencing a
                    cytokine storm<br>
                    <br>
                    Insulin resistance is another top risk factor for
                    COVID-19 that worsens outcomes and increases your
                    risk of death<br>
                    <br>
                    There are five primary parameters of metabolic
                    health: waist circumference, insulin sensitivity,
                    blood pressure, and triglyceride and HDL levels.
                    Having three or more abnormal parameters is
                    indicative of metabolic syndrome..<br>

                      message, that was translated on-air from German

                      of the transcript.<br>
                      <br>
                      Dr. Margarite Griesz-Brisson MD, PhD is a
                      Consultant Neurologist and Neurophysiologist with
                      a PhD in Pharmacology, with special interest in
                      neurotoxicology, environmental medicine,
                      neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity. This is
                      what she has to say about masks and their effects
                      on our brains:<br>
                      <br>
                      “The rebreathing of our exhaled air will without a
                      doubt create oxygen deficiency and a flooding of
                      carbon dioxide. We know that the human brain is
                      very sensitive to oxygen depravation. There are
                      nerve cells for example in the hippocampus, that
                      can’t be longer than 3 minutes without oxygen –
                      they cannot survive. The acute warning symptoms
                      are headaches, drowsiness, dizziness, issues in
                      concentration, slowing down of the reaction time –
                      reactions of the cognitive system.<br>
                      <br>
                      However, when you have chronic oxygen depravation,
                      all of those symptoms disappear, because you get
                      used to it. But your efficiency will remain
                      impaired and the undersupply of oxygen in your
                      brain continues to progress.<br>
                      <br>
                      We know that neurodegenerative diseases take years
                      to decades to develop. If today you forget your
                      phone number, the breakdown in your brain would
                      have already started 20 or 30 years ago.<br>
                      <br>
                      While you’re thinking, that you have gotten used
                      to wearing your mask and rebreathing your own
                      exhaled air, the degenerative processes in your
                      brain are getting amplified as your oxygen
                      deprivation continues.<br>
                      <br>
                      The second problem is that the nerve cells in your
                      brain are unable to divide themselves normally. So
                      in case our governments will generously allow as
                      to get rid of the masks and go back to breathing
                      oxygen freely again in a few months, the lost
                      nerve cells will no longer be regenerated. What is
                      gone is gone.<br>
                      <br>
                      [..]I do not wear a mask, I need my brain to
                      think. I want to have a clear head when I deal
                      with my patients, and not be in a carbon dioxide
                      induced anaesthesia.<br>
                      <br>
                      [..]There is no unfounded medical exemption from
                      face masks because oxygen deprivation is dangerous
                      for every single brain. It must be the free
                      decision of every human being whether they want to
                      wear a mask that is absolutely ineffective to
                      protect themselves from a virus.<br>
                      <br>
                      For children and adolescents, masks are an
                      absolute no-no. Children and adolescents have an
                      extremely active and adaptive immune system and
                      they need a constant interaction with the
                      microbiome of the Earth. Their brain is also
                      incredibly active, as it is has so much to learn.
                      The child’s brain, or the youth’s brain is
                      thirsting for oxygen. The more metabolically
                      active the organ is, the more oxygen it
                      requires.&nbsp; In children and adolescents every
                      organ is metabolically active.<br>
                      <br>
                      To deprive a child’s or an adolescent’s brain from
                      oxygen, or to restrict it in any way, is not only
                      dangerous to their health, it is absolutely
                      criminal. Oxygen deficiency inhibits the
                      development of the brain, and the damage that has
                      taken place as a result CANNOT be reversed<br>

                coronavirus? The CDC says it isn’t available.</b><br>
              <b>By Jon Rappoport</b><br>
            </div>
            <b><br>
              The CDC document is titled, “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus
              (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel.” It is
              dated July 13, 2020.<br>
              <br>
            </b>Buried deep in the document, on page 39, in a section
            titled, “Performance Characteristics,” we have this: “Since
            no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently
            available, assays [diagnostic tests] designed for detection
            of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks
            of in vitro transcribed full length RNA…”<br>
            <br>
            The key phrase there is: “Since no quantified virus isolates
            of the 2019-nCoV are currently available…”<br>
            <br>
            Every object that exists can be quantified, which is to say,
            measured. The use of the term “quantified” in that phrase
            means: the CDC has no measurable amount of the virus,
            because it is unavailable. THE CDC HAS NO VIRUS.<br>
            <br>
            A further tip-off is the use of the word ‘isolates.” This
            means NO ISOLATED VIRUS IS AVAILABLE.<br>
            <br>
            Another way to put it: NO ONE HAS AN ISOLATED SPECIMEN OF
            THE COVID-19 VIRUS.<br>
            <br>
            NO ONE HAS ISOLATED THE COVID-19 VIRUS.<br>
            <br>
            THEREFORE, NO ONE HAS PROVED THAT IT EXISTS.<br>
            <br>
            As if this were not enough of a revelation to shock the
            world, the CDC goes on to say they are presenting a
            diagnostic PCR test to detect the
            virus-that-hasn’t-been-isolated…and the test is looking for
            RNA which is PRESUMED to come from the virus that hasn’t
            been proved to exist.<br>
            <br>
            And using this test, the CDC and every other public health
            agency in the world are counting COVID cases and deaths…and
            governments have instituted lockdowns and economic
            devastation using those case and death numbers as
            justification.<br>
            <br>
            If people believe “you have the virus but it is not
            available,” and you have the virus except it is buried
            within other material and hasn’t been extracted and purified
            and isolated, these people believe the moon is made of green
            cheese.<br>
            <br>
            This is like saying. “We have the 20 trillion dollars, they
            are contained somewhere in our myriad accounts, we just
            don’t know where.” If you don’t know where, you don’t know
            you have the money.<br>
            <br>
            “The car keys are somewhere in the house. We just don’t
            where.” Really? If you don’t know where, you don’t know the
            keys are in the house.<br>
            <br>
            “The missing cruise missile is somewhere in the arsenal, we
            just don’t where.” No. If you don’t know where, you don’t
            know the missile is in the arsenal.<br>
            <br>
            “The COVID-19 virus is somewhere in the material we have—we
            just haven’t removed it from that material. But we know what
            it is and we’ve identified it and we know its structure.” NO
            YOU DON’T. YOU ASSUME THAT.<br>
            <br>
            Science is not assumptions.<br>
            <br>
            “But…but…there is a study which says a few researchers in a
            lab isolated the virus…”<br>
            <br>
            They say they did. But in July, the CDC is saying no virus
            is available. I guess that means trucks were not available
            to bring the virus from that lab to the CDC. The trucks were
            out of gas. It was raining. The bridge was washed out. The
            trucks were in the shop. Joe, the driver, couldn’t find his
            mask, and he didn’t want to leave home without it…<br>
            <br>
            Science is not assumptions.<br>
            <br>
            The pandemic is a fraud, down to the root of the poisonous
            tree.<br>

            <br>
            Cannabis could be used to help treat potentially deadly
            complications with COVID-19, a growing body of research
            suggests. <br>
            <br>
            Researchers at the University of South Carolina performed a
            trio of studies on mice which found that THC - the chemical
            that gives cannabis its mind-altering effect - could help
            prevent a harmful immune response that causes Acute
            Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). <br>
            <br>
            ARDS is one of the most common complications for patients
            with severe cases of coronavirus. It can be fatal or lead to
            permanent pulmonary scarring.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The goal of the USC study was to see if THC could block the
            immune response that leads to ARDS developing by introducing
            a toxin into the mice that triggers the response.<br>
            <br>
            In dozens of experiments across all three studies, all of
            the mice that were given THC after the toxin survived, while
            those that didn't get the chemical died.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            The researchers cautioned that their work is still far from
            conclusive and stressed that they are not encouraging people
            to use marijuana to self-medicate for COVID-19. ...<br>

            ...treatment with THC led to 100% survival of mice. THC
            treatment significantly suppressed the inflammatory
            cytokines, IFN-γ and TNF-α. Additionally, THC elevated the
            induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their associated
            cytokines, IL-10 and TGF-β. Moreover, THC caused induction
            of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs). THC acted
            through CB2 receptor as pharmacological inhibitor of CB2
            receptors blocked the anti-inflammatory effects. THC-treated
            mice showed significant alterations in the expression of
            miRNA (miRs) in the lung-infiltrated mononuclear cells
            (MNCs). Specifically, THC caused downregulation of let7a-5p
            which targeted SOCS1 and downregulation of miR-34-5p which
            caused increased expression of FoxP3, NOS1, and CSF1R.
            Together, these data suggested that THC-mediated alterations
            in miR expression in the lungs may play a critical role in
            the induction of immunosuppressive Tregs and MDSCs as well
            as suppression of cytokine storm leading to attenuation of
            SEB-mediated lung injury.<br>

            Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump
            has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest
            economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that
            chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.<br>
            <br>
            How did he know this? Because of research done by the
            National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director.
            In connection with the SARS outbreak – caused by a
            coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV – the NIH researched
            chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping
            the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is
            likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not
            exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically
            related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name
            SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell
            receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the
            cell and infect the victim...<br>

            Dr. Richard Horowitz is the Medical Director at the Hudson
            Valley Healing Arts Center. Over the years, he has seen more
            than 13,000 Chronic Lyme disease patients.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            Recently, he noticed similarities between Lyme and COVID-19.
            Learning to lower the inflammatory response with Lyme in the
            past, he’s tried some of the same techniques to help people
            battling the coronavirus.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
            “The scientific literature has shown that there are three
            nutritional supplements, something that is very easy, not
            expensive, and easy to find. They’re called NAC, alpha
            lipoic acid, and glutathione,” said Dr. Horowitz. <br>
            <br>
            With the approach of using glutathione, Dr. Horowitz says
            patients noticed results within one hour. Their shortness of
            breath improved.<br>
            <br>
            “If they would see the success that I had in my patients and
            understand the science. I think they would be interested,”
            stated Dr. Horowitz. <br>
            <br>
            He says his next step is to work with state leaders and get
            a randomized controlled study done.<br>

                        leading antibody testing survey to better

                    September 2, 2020<br>
                    <br>
                    The Houston Health Department is collaborating with
                    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
                    (CDC), Rice University, and Baylor College of
                    Medicine to conduct an antibody testing survey to
                    understand how many people in the city were
                    previously infected with the virus that causes
                    COVID-19.<br>
                    <br>
                    The survey will identify people infected in the past
                    with COVID-19 by the presence of antibodies,
                    proteins the body’s immune system makes to fight
                    infections. Antibody testing does not replace oral
                    or nasal swab viral testing that looks for current
                    infection.<br>
                    <br>
                    Teams consisting of Houston Health Department staff
                    and Houston Fire Department paramedics will visit
                    randomly selected homes across Houston, asking
                    household members to answer survey questions and
                    provide a blood sample. Phase one is set to take
                    place Sept. 8-24, with phase two starting in the
                    winter of 2021.<br>

                    JB reports in:<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just got home from back surgery
                    where I spent 4 days in the hospital to start the
                    recovery process. I was able to have some really
                    good conversations with the nurses that were caring
                    for me.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, the hospital was empty
                    (in Alaska).<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked one nurse if I could ask
                    a few questions that I just needed answers for.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, ‘Do masks do anything to
                    stop a virus?” She looked at me shocked, then said
                    “no, they don’t do anything, the N95 does stop a
                    percentage of a virus when you wear one, but overall
                    they don’t do a thing”.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I asked why are there so many
                    mandates then? We are we being bombarded with
                    wearing a mask to save grandma?<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time another nurse said,<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Well, when this all started we
                    were pressured to report everyone who was admitted
                    into the hospital as a covid case. We were also told
                    that we were to report every death as a covid death,
                    and to do our best to get people on a ventilator,
                    even though we knew that it seemed to actually make
                    things worse for the patient.”<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bottom line, most of them
                    refused, and several were fired.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked what they suggested was
                    the best way to fight the virus, and was told, the
                    same things you would do to fight the flu.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was pretty intense, and they
                    were very upset when they started talking about it.
                    Upset as in mad.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn’t wear a mask while I was
                    there and was only asked one time if I would put one
                    on when a certain nurse was coming to that section
                    of the hospital to generally check on patients. So,
                    I did, as it seemed important to the people I was
                    working with. No sense in getting them in trouble.
                    When that person left, I took it back off.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was more conversation,
                    including their thoughts on schools requiring masks,
                    kids committing suicide “in one month more than
                    we’ve had in a year”.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They had strong opinions on
                    lockdowns when “the very thing we need to fight a
                    virus is fresh air and the vitamin D we get from
                    sunlight.”<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One fun thing, when I was being
                    wheeled through the hospital, the nurse stopped a
                    few times to introduce me to other nurses working
                    there, and she would simply say, “Hey so and so, I
                    want you to meet Joshua, he thinks like we do”.<br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So there is a resistance in some
                    of these hospitals!<br>

                    <b> </b><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard approaches to evaluating
                    epidemic policy responses, involving the Value of a
                    Statistical Life, have conceptual problems and are
                    biased towards the elderly and rich.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a life-years criterion as
                    an alternative shows that the lockdowns cost an
                    order of magnitude more life-years than they saved.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the publicized
                    cost-benefit analyses of COVID-19 lockdowns have
                    used coarse measures like lives as units rather than
                    life-years, which misleads politicians and the
                    general public. COVID-19 deaths disproportionately
                    impact the oldest members of the population, whereas
                    the economic impacts of lockdowns disproportionately
                    harm the youngest of the working population, who
                    have far greater life expectancies at the time of
                    impact.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using prior research on workforce
                    entrants and recent graduates entering into a market
                    marred by an economic recession, empirical estimates
                    of life-years lost can be determined. Extensive
                    research on job displacement can be used to estimate
                    the economic impact in life-years of starkly
                    increased unemployment for mid-to-late career
                    workers.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combining these analyses, we
                    found that an estimated 18.7 million life-years will
                    be lost in the United States due to the COVID-19
                    lockdowns. Comparative data analysis between nations
                    shows that the lockdowns in the United States likely
                    had a minimal effect in saving life-years. Using two
                    different comparison groups, we estimate that the
                    COVID-19 lockdowns in the U.S. saved between a
                    quarter to three quarters of a million life-years.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every broad age category lost
                    life-years from the lockdowns including those 55 and
                    older.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The media and state and local
                    governments contributed to the panic by selectively
                    presenting evidence on COVID-19 and shutdowns of
                    dubious benefit.<br>

                    health economists gave poor policy advice and made
                    selective use of the prior research literature. They
                    will likely be rewarded, not punished, by academia
                    for their failure because of academia’s biases.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Public health in general is so
                    biased and vulnerable to motivated cognition that it
                    is not “not yet ready for policy analysis.”<br>

                        WHO-Backed Research Finds Cheap Steroids Reduce
                        COVID-19 Mortality By One-Third</b><br>

                    <br>
                    For the last 2 months, we've been wondering:
                    whatever happened to that British study purporting
                    to show surprising efficacy of cheap steroid
                    dexamethasone in treating COVID-19?<br>
                    <br>
                    While we suspected that drug companies working on
                    vaccines and fancy new treatments (see Gilead's
                    questionably effective remdesivir) might secretly be
                    working to undermine this type of research for fear
                    it might interfere with "innovation" their bottom
                    lines, on Wednesday, a group of doctors brought
                    together by the WHO published a report analyzing
                    several studies on the effectiveness of steroids in
                    treating late-stage COVID-19.<br>
                    <br>
                    The studies, which involved a total of 1,700
                    patients, apparently show that a number of cheap,
                    plentiful corticosteroids (anti-inflammatory drugs
                    that can damp the effects of an overactive immune
                    system) helped lower COVID-19-related mortality by
                    roughly one-third, compared with the 'control' group
                    that didn't receive the medication.<br>
                    <br>
                    The paper published by JAMA featured a meta-analysis
                    performed by the group of scientists and doctors
                    encompassing seven studies done between February and
                    June. All the studies evaluated the use of the
                    commonly used steroid drugs dexamethasone,
                    hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone. The study
                    found relatively consistent benefits for using the
                    drugs in severely ill patients: Of 678 severely ill
                    patients who received steroids, 32.7% died, compared
                    with 41.5% of patients receiving either the usual
                    care, or a placebo (depending on the study).<br>

                &nbsp;As a favor to drug companies that are studying it
                as a potential “drug” treatment for the Wuhan
                coronavirus (COVID-19), the U.S. Food and Drug
                Administration (FDA) is going after N-acetylcysteine, a
                natural compound that the agency is suddenly claiming no
                longer qualifies as a legal dietary supplement.<br>
                <br>
                Reports indicate that the FDA has sent out a series of
                warning letters to supplement manufacturers warning them
                that NAC, as it is also called, does not meet the
                definition of a dietary supplement because it was
                supposedly first approved as a “drug” back in 1963.<br>
                <br>
                The FDA claims that NAC was never marketed as a food or
                supplement prior to the agency’s approval of it as a
                drug. This, according to the agency, means that the
                “rights” to sell it are under the jurisdiction of the
                FDA, which is steering it towards Big Pharma entities
                now trying to capitalize on it as a possible Wuhan
                coronavirus (COVID-19) remedy.<br>

                In a 2017 study conducted by researchers from the Thomas
                Jefferson University, NAC succeeded in slowing down the
                growth of cancer cells in patients with breast cancer.
                The natural antioxidant reduced the aggressiveness of
                tumors by modulating the metabolism of cancer cells. NAC
                also depleted the cancer cells of nutrients, forcing
                them to starve and die. (Related: Yale researchers add
                “reduction of hearing loss” to the many benefits of NAC
                supplements.)<br>

                    Wearing Face Masks Is “Very Dangerous”</b><br>
                </div>
                <br>
                “Having face masks and then think[ing] you can crowd
                your buses or your shopping malls — that’s definitely a
                mistake”.<br>
                Steve Watson<br>
                <br>
                Sweden’s top expert on the coronavirus has warned that
                encouraging people to wear face masks is “very
                dangerous” because it gives a false sense of security
                but does not effectively stem the spread of the virus.<br>
                <br>
                “It is very dangerous to believe face masks would change
                the game when it comes to COVID-19,” said Anders
                Tengell, who has overseen Sweden’s response to the
                pandemic while resisting any form of lockdown or mask
                mandate.<br>
                <br>
                “Face masks can be a complement to other things when
                other things are safely in place,” Tengell added.<br>
                <br>
                “But to start with having face masks and then think[ing]
                you can crowd your buses or your shopping malls — that’s
                definitely a mistake,” he further urged.<br>
                <br>
                Tegnell has consistently spoken out against the use of
                masks, last month declaring that “With numbers
                diminishing very quickly in Sweden, we see no point in
                wearing a face mask in Sweden, not even on public
                transport.”<br>
                <br>
                “The findings that have been produced through face masks
                are astonishingly weak, even though so many people
                around the world wear them,” Tengell has urged.<br>
                <br>
                “I’m surprised that we don’t have more or better studies
                showing what effect masks actually have. Countries such
                as Spain and Belgium have made their populations wear
                masks but their infection numbers have still risen,” the
                epidemiologist also declared.<br>
                <br>
                Sweden, which didn’t enforce any mandatory lockdown
                order, has seen its coronavirus cases and deaths slow to
                a trickle.<br>
                <br>
                “That Sweden has come down to these levels is very
                promising,” Tegnell has said, adding “The curves are
                going down and the curves for the seriously ill are
                beginning to approach zero.”<br>
                <br>
                As Newsweek acknowledged earlier this month, Sweden’s
                COVID-19 death rate is lower than those of Spain, the UK
                and Italy, countries which all imposed lockdowns.<br>
                <br>
                Sweden’s GDP fall of 8.6 in Q2 2020 is also
                significantly less severe than the 12.1 average
                experienced in the Eurozone, leaving the Scandinavian
                country in “much better shape than the rest of Europe.”<br>

                                    my estimation, untrustable.&nbsp;
                                    The other side of the story, buried

                            Sexual contact carries some risk for
                            exposure to infection with severe acute
                            respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during
                            the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. This
                            commentary provides clinicians with guidance
                            on how to address sexual health and activity
                            with patients in this context.<br>
                            <br>
                            More than 200 000 people have died of severe
                            acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2
                            (SARS-CoV-2) infection, leading to
                            widespread concern regarding physical
                            morbidity and mortality. The sexual health
                            implications, however, have received little
                            focus. On the basis of existing data, it
                            appears all forms of in-person sexual
                            contact carry risk for viral transmission,
                            because the virus is readily transmitted by
                            aerosols and fomites. This has resulted in
                            broad guidance regarding physical
                            distancing, with substantial implications
                            for sexual well-being. Given the important
                            role of sexuality in most people's lives,
                            health care providers (HCPs) should consider
                            counseling patients on this topic whenever
                            possible. This is an unprecedented and
                            stressful time for HCPs; facilitating brief
                            conversations and referrals to relevant
                            resources (Table) can help patients maintain
                            sexual wellness amid the pandemic.<br>

                            doesn’t make any sense.”<br>
                            <br>
                            Those weren’t the numbers that her facility
                            reported to the CDC’s National Healthcare
                            Safety Network, under new rules from the
                            Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
                            (CMS), she said.<br>
                            <br>
                            Ajayi said her 80-bed facility actually
                            reported 45 residents have tested positive
                            and five residents died, although the CMS
                            website showed no Saugus deaths. About 19
                            staff members tested positive for the virus,
                            and most have returned to work, she said.<br>

                            ...Considering the risks of chloroquine and
                            hydroxychloroquine, and the evidence
                            suggesting the reason these drugs work for
                            COVID-19 is because they act as zinc
                            ionophores, it’s worth questioning whether
                            other more natural zinc ionophores can be
                            used.<br>
                            <br>
                            One prime example would be quercetin, which
                            is a naturally occurring zinc ionophore.24
                            As reported by the Green Stars Project,25
                            “Researchers from Oak Ridge National Lab
                            used the world’s most powerful
                            supercomputer, SUMMIT, to look for small
                            molecules that might inhibit the COVID-19
                            spike protein from interacting with human
                            cells and, interestingly, quercetin is fifth
                            on that list.”26<br>
                            <br>
                            Quercetin is one of only three natural
                            products found to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2
                            spike protein. The only natural product
                            found to be slightly more effective is
                            luteolin, a polyphenol found in radicchio,
                            green peppers, serrano and green hot chili
                            peppers, chicory, celery and many other
                            foods.27<br>
                            <br>
                            Quercetin is another flavonols compound
                            found in a variety of foods, including
                            apples, Brassica vegetables, capers, onions,
                            tea and tomatoes, just to name a few. It’s
                            also contained in medicinal products such as
                            Ginko biloba, St. John’s Wort (Hypericum
                            perforatum) and elderberry (Sambucus
                            canadensis).<br>
                            <br>
                            Research has already demonstrated that
                            quercetin is a powerful immune booster and
                            broad-spectrum antiviral. As noted in a 2016
                            study28 in the journal Nutrients,
                            quercetin’s mechanisms of action include the
                            inhibition of lipopolysaccharide
                            (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor α
                            (TNF-α) production in macrophages.<br>
                            <br>
                            TNF-α is a cytokine involved in systemic
                            inflammation, secreted by activated
                            macrophages, a type of immune cell that
                            digests foreign substances, microbes and
                            other harmful or damaged components.
                            Quercetin also inhibits the release of
                            pro-inflammatory cytokines and histamine by
                            modulating calcium influx into the cell.29<br>
                            <br>
                            According to this paper, quercetin also
                            stabilizes mast cells and has “a direct
                            regulatory effect on basic functional
                            properties of immune cells,” which allows it
                            to inhibit “a huge panoply of molecular
                            targets in the micromolar concentration
                            range, either by down-regulating or
                            suppressing many inflammatory pathways and
                            functions.”30<br>
                            <br>
                            Another 2016 study31 concluded it helps
                            modulate the NLRP3 inflammasome, an immune
                            system component involved in the
                            uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory
                            cytokines that occurs during a cytokine
                            storm. <br>

                            In vitro studies 32,33,34 have shown
                            quercetin exerts antiviral activity against
                            SARS-CoV, and preliminary findings35 suggest
                            quercetin can inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main
                            protease as well. ...<br>
                            <br>
                            As for dosage, here are some basic
                            recommendations:<br>
                            <br>
                            Quercetin — According to research from
                            Appalachian State University in North
                            Carolina, taking 500 mg to 1,000 mg of
                            quercetin per day for 12 weeks results in
                            “large but highly variable increases in
                            plasma quercetin … unrelated to demographic
                            or lifestyle factors.”41<br>
                            <br>
                            Zinc (and copper) — When it comes to zinc,
                            remember that more is not necessarily
                            better. In fact, it can backfire. When
                            taking zinc, you also need to be mindful of
                            maintaining a healthy zinc-to-copper ratio.
                            As noted by Chris Masterjohn, who has a
                            Ph.D. in nutritional sciences,42 in an
                            article43 and series of Twitter posts:44<br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In one study, 300mg/day
                            of zinc as two divided doses of 150 mg zinc
                            sulfate decreased important markers of
                            immune function, such as the ability of
                            immune cells known as polymorphonuclear
                            leukocytes to migrate toward and consume
                            bacteria. <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most concerning
                            effect in the context of COVID-19 is that it
                            lowered the lymphocyte stimulation index 3
                            fold. This is a measure of the ability of T
                            cells to increase their numbers in response
                            to a perceived threat. The reason this is so
                            concerning in the context of COVID-19 is
                            that poor outcomes are associated with low
                            lymphocytes …<br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The negative effect on
                            lymphocyte proliferation found with 300
                            mg/day and the apparent safety in this
                            regard of 150 mg/d suggests that the
                            potential for hurting the immune system may
                            begin somewhere between 150-300 mg/d … <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite possible that
                            the harmful effect of 300 mg/d zinc on the
                            lymphocyte stimulation index is mediated
                            mostly or completely by induction of copper
                            deficiency … <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The negative effect of
                            zinc on copper status has been shown with as
                            little as 60 mg/d zinc. This intake lowers
                            the activity of superoxide dismutase, an
                            enzyme important to antioxidant defense and
                            immune function that depends both on zinc
                            and copper …<br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A study done with
                            relatively low intakes of zinc suggested
                            that acceptable ratios of zinc to copper
                            range from 2:1 to 15:1 in favor of zinc.
                            Copper appears safe to consume up to a
                            maximum of 10 mg/d. <br>
                            <br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notably, the maximum
                            amount of zinc one could consume while
                            staying in the acceptable range of
                            zinc-to-copper ratios and also staying
                            within the upper limit for copper is 150
                            mg/d.”...<br>
                            <br>
                            Masterjohn stresses that you’ll want to keep
                            your total zinc intake below 150 mg per day
                            to avoid negative effects on your immune
                            system. He also recommends getting at least
                            1 mg of copper from food and supplements for
                            every 15 mg of zinc you take...<br>

                            successful treatment for hospitalized covid
                            patients. She illistrates the specific
                            findings of over 50 patients that have been
                            treated and allows for some of the patient
                            testimonies about their experience. Some of
                            her videos have been sensored by youtube

                            something different here by translating
                            parts of the interview and then posting

                            the end. Apparantly, many in Central and
                            South America have used this for years and

                            ...by UCSF graduate student Michael Schoof,
                            a team of researchers engineered a
                            completely synthetic, production-ready
                            molecule that straitjackets the crucial
                            SARS-CoV-2 machinery that allows the virus
                            to infect our cells. As reported in a new
                            paper, now available on the preprint server
                            bioRxiv, experiments using live virus show
                            that the molecule is among the most potent
                            SARS-CoV-2 antivirals yet discovered.<br>
                            <br>
                            In an aerosol formulation they tested,
                            dubbed “AeroNabs” by the researchers, these
                            molecules could be self-administered with a
                            nasal spray or inhaler. Used once a day,
                            AeroNabs could provide powerful, reliable
                            protection against SARS-CoV-2 until a
                            vaccine becomes available. The research team
                            is in active discussions with commercial
                            partners to ramp up manufacturing and
                            clinical testing of AeroNabs. If these tests
                            are successful, the scientists aim to make
                            AeroNabs widely available as an inexpensive,
                            over-the-counter medication to prevent and
                            treat COVID-19....</font></font></font></font></font></font></font><b><font

                            SARS-CoV-2 continue to rise worldwide with
                            devastating health and economic costs.
                            SARS-CoV-2 gains entry into host cells via
                            an interaction between its Spike protein and
                            the host cell receptor angiotensin
                            converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Disruption of
                            this interaction confers potent
                            neutralization of viral entry, providing an
                            avenue for vaccine design and for
                            therapeutic antibodies. Here, we develop
                            single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that
                            potently disrupt the interaction between the

                            yeast surface-displayed library of synthetic
                            nanobody sequences, we identified a panel of
                            nanobodies that bind to multiple epitopes on
                            Spike and block ACE2 interaction via two
                            distinct mechanisms. Cryogenic electron
                            microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that one
                            exceptionally stable nanobody, Nb6, binds
                            Spike in a fully inactive conformation with
                            its receptor binding domains (RBDs) locked
                            into their inaccessible down-state,
                            incapable of binding ACE2. Affinity
                            maturation and structure-guided design of
                            multivalency yielded a trivalent nanobody,
                            mNb6-tri, with femtomolar affinity for
                            SARS-CoV-2 Spike and picomolar
                            neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
                            mNb6-tri retains stability and function
                            after aerosolization, lyophilization, and
                            heat treatment. These properties may enable
                            aerosol-mediated delivery of this potent
                            neutralizer directly to the airway
                            epithelia, promising to yield a widely
                            deployable, patient-friendly prophylactic
                            and/or early infection therapeutic agent to
                            stem the worst pandemic in a century.<br>

                            given new life to the push for a unique
                            patient identifier. The unique patient
                            identifier was authorized in 1996, but
                            appropriations bills since 1998 have
                            contained a provision forbidding the federal
                            government from developing and implementing
                            the identifier. Unfortunately, two weeks
                            ago, the House of Representatives voted to
                            repeal the ban. The unique patient
                            identifier would aid government efforts to
                            track and vaccinate every American, as well
                            as to infringe in other ways on liberty in
                            the name of “health.” ...<br>

                    <br>
                    Only seven! (Yes, I confirmed this on

                    is only seven.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Texas physician Dr. Richard Bartlett has had a 100
                    percent success rate with his patients, many with
                    life-threatening co-morditities, but the media has
                    been ignoring it.<br>
                    <br>
                    In this video, Dr. Bartlett shares the stories
                    people who he has treated using a steroid called
                    budesonide, inhaled through a nebulizer. Dr.
                    Bartlett has previously referred to his treatment as
                    a “silver bullet” for the coronavirus. Worth
                    watching at least the first 5 minutes.<br>

                    Budesonide<br>
                    <br>
                    Only seven deaths of Covid-19 in Taiwan!<br>
                    <br>
                    “Same situation in Japan,” says Dr Bartlett. “One
                    hundred and twenty-one million people in Japan, and
                    they’ve had less than a thousand people die during
                    the whole pandemic. In Singapore, only 12 people
                    have died in the entire country during the whole
                    pandemic.”<br>
                    <br>
                    What is the secret to these low death counts?<br>
                    <br>
                    People in those countries are using an inhaled
                    steroid called budesomide, says Dr Bartlett, who
                    calls budesomide the “silver bullet.”<br>
                    <br>
                    “It’s super cheap,” say Dr. Bartlett. “It’s about
                    $200 for the entire treatment if you use cash. Many
                    of my patients who use insurance pay nothing out of
                    pocket.”<br>
                    <br>
                    Budesonide is an asthma medicine, says Dr Bartlett.
                    It’s a respiratory anti-inflammatory, and Covid-19
                    is a respiratory inflammation disease.<br>
                    <br>
                    “And it works,” says Dr Bartlett. “A hundred percent
                    of my (Covid-19) patients are alive.”You use a
                    nebulizer machine.<br>
                    <br>
                    “People start feeling better after the first
                    treatment,” Bartlett adds.<br>
                    <br>
                    Note: This was first posted on YouTube more than a
                    month ago. But have you seen any word about this in
                    the mainstream media?<br>
                    <br>
                    Every person in the entire world should be made
                    aware of this simple, cheap rapid solution to the
                    pandemic. They should know about Dr Bartlett’s
                    “silver bullet.”<br>

                    been FDA approved for 65 years, given to pregnant

                    HCQ is irrefutable. The evidence supporting HCQ
                    efficacy against Covid-19 is also overwhelming. All
                    negative HCQ studies have used either: too much,
                    used it alone (it needs Zinc), or used it late (it
                    should be early.) The treatment dose is 200 mg HCQ
                    twice a day for five days + Zinc 50 (elemental)
                    daily. The prophylactic dose is 400 mg HCQ weekly +
                    Zinc 50 (elemental) daily. (There are studies right
                    now to see if HCQ 200 mg. weekly is sufficient.)
                    This is very low dose. (The usual dose of HCQ in
                    Lupus, Rheumatoid Arthritis is 400 mg. daily for
                    years.) There are telemedicine physicians who are
                    aware of the facts and if you are concerned about
                    this, please see one. It is also over the counter in

              “In the future, we will eliminate the soul with medicine.
              Under the pretext of a ‘healthy point of view’, there will
              be a vaccine by which the human body will be treated as
              soon as possible directly at birth: So that the human
              being cannot develop the thought of the existence of soul
              and Spirit. To materialistic doctors, will be entrusted
              with the task of removing the soul of humanity. As today,
              people are vaccinated against this disease or that
              disease, so in the future: Children will be vaccinated
              with a substance that can be produced precisely in such a
              way that people, thanks to this vaccination, will be
              immune to being subjected to the “madness” of spiritual
              life.&nbsp; He would be extremely smart, but he would not
              develop a conscience, and that is the true goal of some
              materialistic circles. With such a vaccine, you can easily
              make the etheric (spiritual) body loose in the physical
              body. Once the etheric body is detached, the relationship
              between the universe and the etheric body would become
              extremely unstable, and man would become an automaton, for
              the physical body of man must be polished on this Earth by
              spiritual will.<br>
              So, the vaccine becomes a kind of arymanique force; man
              can no longer get rid of a given materialistic feeling. He
              becomes materialistic of constitution and can no longer
              rise to the spiritual “.<br>

            <br>
            In a test of antiviral effectiveness against the virus that
            causes COVID-19, an extract from edible seaweeds
            substantially outperformed remdesivir, the current standard
            antiviral used to combat the disease. Heparin, a common
            blood thinner, and a heparin variant stripped of its
            anticoagulant properties, performed on par with Remdesivir
            in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in mammalian cells.<br>
            <br>
            Published online&nbsp; in Cell Discovery, the research is
            the latest example of a decoy strategy researchers from the
            Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies
            (CBIS) at Rensselear Polytechnic Institute are developing
            against viruses like the novel coronavirus that spawned the
            current global health crisis.In a test of antiviral
            effectiveness against the virus that causes COVID-19, an
            extract from edible seaweeds substantially outperformed
            Remdesivir, the current standard antiviral used to combat
            the disease.<br>
            <br>
            The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 latches onto
            the ACE-2 receptor, a molecule on the surface of human
            cells. Once secured, the virus inserts its own genetic
            material into the cell, hijacking the cellular machinery to
            produce replica viruses. But the virus could just as easily
            be persuaded to lock onto a decoy molecule that offers a
            similar fit. The neutralized virus would be trapped and
            eventually degrade naturally.<br>
            <br>
            Previous research has shown this decoy technique works in
            trapping other viruses, including dengue, Zika, and
            influenza A. To hear the researchers discuss their findings,
            watch this video.<br>
            <br>
            “We’re learning how to block viral infection, and that is
            knowledge we are going to need if we want to rapidly
            confront pandemics,” said Jonathan Dordick, the lead
            researcher and a professor of chemical and biological
            engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. “The
            reality is that we don’t have great antivirals. To protect
            ourselves against future pandemics, we are going to need an
            arsenal of approaches that we can quickly adapt to emerging
            viruses.”<br>
            <br>
            The Cell Discovery paper tests antiviral activity in three
            variants of heparin (heparin, trisulfated heparin, and a
            non-anticoagulant low molecular weight heparin) and two
            fucoidans (RPI-27 and RPI-28) extracted from seaweed. All
            five compounds are long chains of sugar molecules known as
            sulfated polysaccharides, a structural conformation that the
            results of a binding study published earlier this month in
            Antiviral Research suggested as an effective decoy.<br>
            <br>
            The researchers performed a dose response study known as an
            EC50 — shorthand for the effective concentration of the
            compound that inhibits 50% of viral infectivity — with each
            of the five compounds on mammalian cells. For the results of
            an EC50, which are given in a molar concentration, a lower
            value signals a more potent compound.<br>
            <br>
            RPI-27 yielded an EC50 value of approximately 83 nanomolar,
            while a similar previously published and independent in
            vitro test of remdesivir on the same mammalian cells yielded
            an EC50 of 770 nanomolar. Heparin yielded an EC50 of 2.1
            micromolar, or about one-third as active as remdesivir, and
            a non-anticoagulant analog of heparin yielded an EC50 of 5.0
            micromolar, about one-fifth as active as remdesivir.<br>
            <br>
            A separate test found no cellular toxicity in any of the
            compounds, even at the highest concentrations tested.<br>
            <br>
            “What interests us is a new way of getting at infection,”
            said Robert Linhardt, a Rensselaer professor of chemistry
            and chemical biology who is collaborating with Dordick to
            develop the decoy strategy. “The current thinking is that
            the COVID-19 infection starts in the nose, and either of
            these substances could be the basis for a nasal spray. If
            you could simply treat the infection early, or even treat
            before you have the infection, you would have a way of
            blocking it before it enters the body.”<br>
            <br>
            Dordick added that compounds from seaweed “could serve as a
            basis for an oral delivery approach to address potential
            gastrointestinal infection.”<br>
            <br>
            In studying SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data, Dordick and Linhardt
            recognized several motifs on the structure of the spike
            protein that promised a fit compatible with heparin, a
            result borne out in the binding study. The spike protein is
            heavily encrusted in glycans, an adaptation that protects it
            from human enzymes which could degrade it, and prepares it
            to bind with a specific receptor on the cell surface.<br>

            “It’s a very complicated mechanism that we quite frankly
            don’t know all the details about, but we’re getting more
            information,” said Dordick. “One thing that’s become clear
            with this study is that the larger the molecule, the better
            the fit. The more successful compounds are the larger
            sulfated polysaccharides that offer a greater number of
            sites on the molecules to trap the virus.”<br>
            <br>
            Molecular modeling based on the binding study revealed sites
            on the spike protein where the heparin was able to interact,
            raising the prospects for similar sulfated polysaccharides.<br>
            <br>
            “This exciting research by Professors Dordick and Linhardt
            is among several ongoing research efforts at CBIS, as well
            as elsewhere at Rensselaer, to tackle the challenges of the
            COVID-19 pandemic through novel therapeutic approaches and
            the repurposing of existing drugs,” said CBIS Director
            Deepak Vashishth.<br>
            <br>
            “Sulfated polysaccharides effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in
            vitro” was published in Cell Discovery with the support of
            the National Research Foundation of Korea. At Rensselaer,

            </b><b><br>
            </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
            </b>A country level exploratory analysis was conducted to
            assess the impact of timing and type of national health
            policy/actions undertaken towards COVID-19 mortality and
            related health outcomes.<br>
            <b>Methods</b><b><br>
            </b>Information on COVID-19 policies and health outcomes
            were extracted from websites and country specific sources.
            Data collection included the government's action, level of
            national preparedness, and country specific socioeconomic
            factors. Data was collected from the top 50 countries ranked
            by number of cases. Multivariable negative binomial
            regression was used to identify factors associated with
            COVID-19 mortality and related health outcomes.<br>
            <b>Findings</b><b><br>
            </b>Increasing COVID-19 caseloads were associated with
            countries with higher obesity (adjusted rate ratio
            [RR]=1.06; 95%CI: 1.01–1.11), median population age
            (RR=1.10; 95%CI: 1.05–1.15) and longer time to border
            closures from the first reported case (RR=1.04; 95%CI:
            1.01–1.08). Increased mortality per million was
            significantly associated with higher obesity prevalence
            (RR=1.12; 95%CI: 1.06–1.19) and per capita gross domestic
            product (GDP) (RR=1.03; 95%CI: 1.00–1.06). Reduced income
            dispersion reduced mortality (RR=0.88; 95%CI: 0.83–0.93) and
            the number of critical cases (RR=0.92; 95% CI: 0.87–0.97).
            Rapid border closures, full lockdowns, and wide-spread
            testing were not associated with COVID-19 mortality per
            million people. However, full lockdowns (RR=2.47: 95%CI:
            1.08–5.64) and reduced country vulnerability to biological
            threats (i.e. high scores on the global health security
            scale for risk environment) (RR=1.55; 95%CI: 1.13–2.12) were
            significantly associated with increased patient recovery
            rates.<br>
            <b>Interpretation</b><b><br>
            </b>In this exploratory analysis, low levels of national
            preparedness, scale of testing and population
            characteristics were associated with increased national case
            load and overall mortality.<br>

            </div>
            <b>&nbsp;Abstract</b><b><br>
            </b>In this research, we show that 5G millimeter waves could
            be absorbed by dermatologic cells acting like antennas,
            transferred to other cells and play the main role in
            producing Coronaviruses in biological cells. DNA is built
            from charged electrons and atoms and has an inductor-like
            structure. This structure could be divided into linear,
            toroid and round inductors. Inductors interact with external
            electromagnetic waves, move and produce some extra waves
            within the cells. The shapes of these waves are similar to
            shapes of hexagonal and pentagonal bases of their DNA
            source. These waves produce some holes in liquids within the
            nucleus. To fill these holes, some extra hexagonal and
            pentagonal bases are produced. These bases could join to
            each other and form virus-like structures such as
            Coronavirus. To produce these viruses within a cell, it is
            necessary that the wavelength of external waves be shorter
            than the size of the cell. Thus 5G millimeter waves could be
            good candidates for applying in constructing virus-like
            structures such as Coronaviruses (COVID-19) within cells.<br>

            health care system has encountered.<br>
            <br>
            Not because it came from extraterrestrials, but because of
            all of the various different ways it's able to wreak havoc
            on the human body. It's so novel that we don't have a good
            natural analog to compare it to.<br>
            <br>
            And it's still confounding us. While it looked as if we had
            contained it here in the US, it's now surging back so
            strongly that overwhelmed hospitals are convening "survival
            panels" to determine who gets treated and who gets sent home
            to likely die.<br>
            <br>
            We are learning more about it every day, and have a long way
            to go until we really understand well how it works and how
            to fight it. So we need to remain vigilant in our efforts to
            avoid it, or else the resurging death count may go a lot

                <br>

            Background:During the 2003 severe acute respiratory
            distresssyndrome epidemic, healthcareworkers mandatorily
            wore theprotective N95 face-mask.Methods:We administered a
            survey tohealthcare workers to determine risk factors
            associated withdevelopment of headaches (frequency, headache
            subtypes and durationof face-mask wear) and the impact of
            headaches (sick days, headachefrequency and use of
            abortive/preventive headache medications).Results:In the
            survey, 212 (47 male, 165 female) healthcare workers ofmean
            age 31 years (range, 21–58) participated. Of the 79
            (37.3%)respondents who reported face-mask-associated
            headaches, 26 (32.9%)reported headache frequency exceeding
            six times per month. Six (7.6%)had taken sick leave from
            March 2003 to June 2004 (mean 2 days;range 1–4 days) and 47
            (59.5%) required use of abortive analgesicsbecause of
            headache. Four (2.1%) took preventive medications
            forheadaches during this period. Multivariate logistic
            regressionshowed that pre-existing headaches [P¼0.041,
            OR¼1.97 (95% CI1.03–3.77)] and continuous use of the N95
            face-mask exceeding 4 h[P¼0.053, OR¼1.85 (95% CI 0.99–3.43)]
            were associated withdevelopment of
            headaches.Conclusions:Healthcare providers maydevelop
            headaches following the use of the N95 face-mask.
            Shorterduration of face-mask wear may reduce the frequency
            and severity ofthese headaches.<br>

            As Americans turn against each other over mask mandates,
            many scientists are speaking out, including former professor
            of physics at the University of Ottawa, Denis Rancourt, PhD,
            who just released a paper compiling seven studies on the
            science surrounding the effectiveness of masks. <br>

            restaurant at the beach. The lunch was on a terrace outside.
