      <br>
      Researchers at a Hong Kong university say they have developed an
      antiviral coating which could provide 90 days of “significant”
      protection against bacteria and viruses such as the one causing
      COVID-19.<br>
      <br>
      The coating, called MAP-1, took 10 years to develop and can be
      sprayed on surfaces that are frequently used by the public, such
      as elevator buttons and handrails, researchers at the Hong Kong
      University of Science and Technology (HKUST) say.<br>
      <br>
      “These places are frequently touched, and, at the same time, serve
      as a very effective medium for transmission of diseases,” said
      HKUST Adjunct Professor Joseph Kwan, one of the chief researchers
      in the team that developed the product. <br>
      <br>
      The coating that forms after spraying has millions of
      nano-capsules containing disinfectants, which Kwan says remain

      </div>
      <br>
      New research from the University of Southampton has found that
      copper can effectively help to prevent the spread of respiratory
      viruses, which are linked to severe acute respiratory syndrome
      (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).<br>
      <br>
      Animal coronaviruses that 'host jump' to humans, such as SARS and
      MERS, result in severe infections with high mortality. The
      Southampton researchers found that a closely-related human
      coronavirus - 229E - can remain infectious on common surface
      materials for several days, but is rapidly destroyed on copper.<br>
      <br>
      A newly-published paper in mBio - a journal of the American
      Society for Microbiology - reports that human coronavirus 229E,
      which produces a range of respiratory symptoms from the common
      cold to more lethal outcomes such as pneumonia, can survive on
      surface materials including ceramic tiles, glass, rubber and
      stainless steel for at least five days. While human-to-human
      transmission is important, infections can be contracted by
      touching surfaces contaminated by respiratory droplets from
      infected individuals, or hand touching, leading to a wider and
      more rapid spread<br>
      <br>
      On copper, and a range of copper alloys - collectively termed
      'antimicrobial copper' - the coronavirus was rapidly inactivated
      (within a few minutes, for simulated fingertip contamination).
      Exposure to copper destroyed the virus completely and
      irreversibly, leading the researchers to conclude that
      antimicrobial copper surfaces could be employed in communal areas
      and at any mass gatherings to help reduce the spread of
      respiratory viruses and protect public health.<br>
      <br>
      Lead researcher Dr Sarah Warnes said: "Transmission of infectious
      diseases via contaminated surfaces is far more important than was
      originally thought, and this includes viruses that cause
      respiratory infections. This is especially important when the
      infectious dose is low and just a few virus particles can initiate
      an infection.<br>
      <br>
      "Human coronavirus, which also has ancestral links with bat-like
      viruses responsible for SARS and MERS, was found to be permanently
      and rapidly deactivated upon contact with copper. What's more, the
      viral genome and structure of the viral particles were destroyed,
      so nothing remained that could pass on an infection. With the lack
      of antiviral treatments, copper offers a measure that can help
      reduce the risk of these infections spreading."<br>
      <br>
      Speaking on the importance of the study, Professor Bill Keevil,
      co-author and Chair in Environmental Healthcare at the University
      of Southampton, said: "Respiratory viruses are responsible for
      more deaths, globally, than any other infectious agent. The
      evolution of new respiratory viruses, and the re-emergence of
      historic virulent strains, poses a significant threat to human
      health.<br>
      <br>
      "The rapid inactivation and irreversible destruction of the virus
      observed on copper and copper alloy surfaces suggests that the
      incorporation of copper alloy surfaces - in conjunction with
      effective cleaning regimes and good clinical practice - could help
      control transmission of these viruses."<br>
      <br>
      Previous research by Professor Keevil and Dr Warnes has proved
      copper's efficacy against norovirus, influenza and hospital
      superbugs, such as MRSA and Klebsiella, plus stopping the transfer
      of antibiotic resistance genes to other bacteria to create new
      superbugs.<br>

          Surfaces</b><br>
        <b>Christophe Espírito Santo, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Metallic copper surfaces rapidly and efficiently kill bacteria.
      Cells exposed to copper surfaces accumulated large amounts of
      copper ions, and this copper uptake was faster from dry copper
      than from moist copper. Cells suffered extensive membrane damage
      within minutes of exposure to dry copper. Further, cells removed
      from copper showed loss of cell integrity. Acute contact with
      metallic copper surfaces did not result in increased mutation
      rates or DNA lesions. These findings are important first steps for
      revealing the molecular sensitive targets in cells lethally
      challenged by exposure to copper surfaces and provide a scientific
      explanation for the use of copper surfaces as antimicrobial agents
      for supporting public hygiene.<br>
      <br>
      For many organisms, the trace element copper is an essential
      nutrient. It serves as a cofactor in respiration, and thus copper
      is required for aerobic metabolism. However, when copper is in
      excess, it is also highly toxic (29). This is because accumulation
      of copper ions or intracellular release of free copper ions from
      proteins causes cell damage. Copper readily catalyzes reactions
      that result in the production of hydroxyl radicals through the
      Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions (13, 14). The highly reactive
      oxygen intermediates cause lipid peroxidation and oxidation of
      proteins (14, 16, 33). Free copper ions are able to oxidize
      sulfhydryl groups, such as cysteine, in proteins or the cellular
      redox buffer glutathione (15, 34). Specifically, copper ions
      inactivate proteins by damaging Fe-S clusters in cytoplasmic
      hydratases. In Escherichia coli, these are dihydroxy-acid
      dehydratase (IlvD) in the branched-chain amino acid synthesis
      pathway, isopropylmalate dehydratase (LeuC) in the
      leucine-specific branch, fumarase A (FumA) in the tricarboxylic
      acid cycle, and 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase in the pentose
      phosphate pathway (Edd). All were recently found to be damaged by
      copper ions (17). Thus, these proteins constitute specific targets
      for copper-induced toxicity. In Bacillus subtilis, copper ion
      toxicity was shown to interfere with the biosynthesis of Fe-S
      clusters and increased production of cluster scaffold and target
      proteins (5). In vitro exposure of DNA to copper ions causes
      mutations (36). It has also been thought that in vivo copper ion
      toxicity in bacteria is mediated by oxidative DNA damage, but this
      view was challenged because the growth rate of E. coli was found
      to be more strongly suppressed by copper ions under anaerobic
      conditions than when oxygen was present (28). Copper ions even
      decreased oxidative DNA damage when E. coli cells were exposed to
      hydrogen peroxide (18).<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, it has become evident that copper surfaces with
      which pathogenic agents may come in contact, i.e., metallic copper
      touch surfaces, may help diminish surface-related hygiene
      problems. Dry copper surfaces in laboratory settings and in
      hospital trials proved to have great killing efficiency against a
      wide range of microbes (4, 9, 26). In most laboratory studies,
      cells suspended in buffer were applied to copper surfaces and
      incubated under ambient conditions. Usually, these cells were
      killed within hours (8, 25). We recently established a method that
      mimics contact of microbes with dry copper touch surfaces. Under
      these conditions, most microbes are killed within minutes (9, 10).
      Copper ions are released from metallic copper upon contact with
      bacteria (10) or with buffer alone (25). However, direct copper
      ion-mediated toxicity, targeting metabolic enzymes such as
      hydratases involved in amino acid biosynthesis (17), is unlikely
      to be the reason for contact killing because of the fast killing
      kinetics. Furthermore, extracellular supplementation with
      substances known to protect against oxidative stress, such as
      catalase, superoxide dismutase, or the hydroxyl radical quencher
      mannitol, delayed the killing of E. coli cells on dry copper
      surfaces (10). Thus, while we have some insight into the molecular
      mode of action exerted by copper ions on bacteria, the specific
      modes of stress exerted by metallic copper surfaces and the
      identity of sensitive cellular targets have not yet been
      elucidated. Such knowledge is needed to better understand why
      surfaces made from copper alloys exhibited efficient antimicrobial
      properties in recent successfully completed hospital trials (4,
      19, 23).<br>
      <br>
      In this study, we investigated the mode of action of dry metallic
      copper surfaces against E. coli and other bacterial model
      organisms. Our results demonstrate that exposed cells accumulated
      copper ions and exhibited membrane and cell envelope damage. It is
      likely that membrane proteins or the membrane lipids constitute
      the major targets of copper surface toxicity, but contact killing
      did not involve lethal damage to the cellular DNA through
      mutations and lesions...<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, this study proposes cell envelope damage as the
      mode of action of contact killing mediated by dry metallic copper
      surfaces. The toxicity exerted does not target the genomic DNA in
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms tested, even though
      cells are overloaded with copper ions. Further research will be
      directed at identifying the molecular targets through which
      membranes are damaged upon contact with metallic copper. It will
      be interesting to test whether specific membrane proteins or the
      lipids themselves constitute the weakest link in cells exposed to
      this lethal challenge.<br>

      </div>
      An electromagnetic shielding apparatus for covering and protecting
      the head of a user from EMF radiation which may be worn by itself
      or discretely beneath other head gear. A head covering is
      fabricated from a conductive, non-magnetizable material such as
      copper, bronze, brass or the like which may be drawn and shaped
      into a web or mesh material. The resulting shield is lightweight,
      air permeable and supple enough to be worn beneath other head
      gear.<br>

          Antiviral Masks: What Are Their Advantages Over N95 Masks?</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      ...The School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at the
      Xi'an University of Electronic Science and Technology has
      developed an “electrostatic antiviral mask” with a special “air
      purifier”. Associate Professor Tong Xufeng has shared information
      about the advantages of the new mask compared to the standard N95
      mask.<br>
      <br>
      He said that viruses can’t survive in the air alone: ​​they spread
      mainly by attaching themselves to particles. Therefore, the virus
      first needs to cling to something. The diameter of such particles
      is usually less than PM 2.5, about 1 micron.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The advantage of the new mask is mainly that
      it can filter out particles with a diameter of less than 1
      micrometre. Having absorbed these particles, the mask uses rays
      and high-voltage fields to kill viral organisms. If you use
      conventional masks that filter PM 2.5, they don’t filter out
      particles smaller than 2.5 microns"...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ave increased the radiation power of the
      original masks. The high voltage created by first-generation
      electronic masks is more than 3000 volts; we have increased it by
      another 1000 volts. Usually, ozone appears under high voltage. Its
      smell is very unpleasant, but our new electronic masks filter out
      ozone. Moreover, we guarantee that the mask’s high voltage is not
      harmful for people. We take this very seriously".<br>
      <br>
      The new masks are expected to enter the market in about two
      months. Tong Xufeng said that they have already applied to the
      relevant departments to certify the new antiviral mask and are
      currently awaiting verification and approval. At the same time,
      mass production of the masks is being prepared.<br>

          The following is the text of a study by Prof Isaac Ben-Israel,
          first published on April 16, 2020. (Ben-Israel discussed his
          research on Israeli TV on April 13, saying that simple
          statistics show the spread of the coronavirus declines to
          almost zero after 70 days — no matter where it strikes, and no
          matter what measures governments impose to try to thwart it.)
          <br>
          <br>
          The following article aims at examining the development of the
          coronavirus disease in Israel since its inception 56 days ago
          (8 weeks).<br>
          <br>
          It turns out that the peak of the virus’ spread has been
          behind us for about two weeks now, and will probably fade
          within two more weeks.<br>
          <br>
          Our analysis shows that this is a constant pattern across
          countries. Surprisingly, this pattern is common to countries
          that have taken a severe lockdown, including the paralysis of
          the economy, as well as to countries that implemented a far
          more lenient policy and have continued in ordinary life.<br>
          <br>
          The data indicates that the lockdown policy can be stopped
          within a few days and replaced by a policy of moderate social
          distancing...<br>
