                  along with Ivermectin has yielded near-miraculous
                  results in Covid 19 patients claim experts from
                  Bangladesh. The Hunt for new effective treatment for
                  Covid 19 is on. A team of doctors from Bangladesh have
                  claimed that their research on the combination of two
                  widely used drugs has yielded astounding results in
                  curing the patients with acute symptoms of the
                  coronavirus that has created havoc worldwide and
                  claimed the lives of over 312,000 people globally. The
                  claim by the Bangladeshi medical team, which includes
                  prominent physicians from the country, comes amidst
                  the desperate global attempts for a remedy to the
                  deadly coronavirus.<br>
                  <br>
                  We have got astounding results. Out of 60 COVID-19
                  patients, all recovered as the combination of the two
                  drugs were applied, said Professor Dr Md Tarek Alam,
                  the head of medicine department at private Bangladesh
                  Medical College Hospital (BMCH). Alam, a reputed
                  clinician in Bangladesh, said a frequently used
                  antiprotozoal medicine called Ivermectin in a single
                  dose with Doxycycline, an antibiotic, yielded
                  virtually the near-miraculous result in curing the
                  patients with COVID-19.<br>
                  &nbsp;<br>
                  My team was prescribing the two medicines only for
                  coronavirus patients, most of them initially reporting
                  with respiratory problems with related complaints,
                  later to be tested COVID-19 positive, he said.
                  Bangladesh has so far reported 20,995 coronavirus
                  cases. A total of 314 people have lost their lives in
                  the country due to the disease. Claiming that the
                  efficacy of the drug developed by them was such that
                  patients recovered from the virus within 4 days, he
                  said, adding that there were no side effects of it.<br>
                  <br>
                  We first ask them to be tested for COVID-19 and when
                  found coronavirus positive we apply the drugs . . .
                  they are recovering within four days". "The repeated
                  or second tests, in line with the procedure,
                  reconfirmed them COVID-19 negative in all the cases
                  under the research which found the combination to have
                  no side effects on patients either, he said. We are
                  hundred per cent hopeful about the effectiveness of
                  the combination, he said, adding they by now contacted
                  the concerned government regulators and preparing to
                  exhaust international procedures for acknowledgement
                  of the drugs for the COVID-19 treatment...</font><b><font

                  situation posed by the COVID-19 coronavirus among
                  high-risk individuals and the vulnerability of the
                  earth’s 7.9 billion human population to a newly
                  mutated COVID-19 coronavirus without a proven vaccine
                  has prompted Moshe Shifrine PhD&nbsp; to pose a
                  revolutionary therapy based upon his decades of
                  research in the field of olfactory (smell) therapy.<br>
                  <br>
                  Dr. Shifrine holds two patents on the use of odors to
                  tickle the olfactory bulb in the nose to produce
                  hormones like testosterone and insulin.&nbsp; Dr.
                  Shifrine writes:<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Just a small number of molecules
                  (in a concentration in billionths of a gram) in the
                  nasal passages are needed to carry scent to the 20,000
                  nerve receptors in the olfactory bulb that is located
                  on both hemispheres of the forebrain.&nbsp; When the
                  molecules attach to these receptors their vibratory
                  signature sends an electric signal to the hypothalamus
                  in the brain that results in the production of the
                  smelled substance.&nbsp; For example, the scent of
                  testosterone or insulin stimulates the body’s
                  production of these hormones.”<br>
                  <br>
                  Dr. Shifrine instructs:&nbsp; The olfactory system is
                  able to distinguish 12,000 different aromas.<br>

                  Dr. Shifrine holds a patent (US 8,679,507 B2) for the
                  use of truffle extract that contains a very small
                  amount of natural testosterone. A whiff of same has
                  been demonstrated to double testosterone levels in men
                  in all ten subjects tested.&nbsp; The truffle extract,
                  available commercially, also elevates testosterone
                  levels in females and was demonstrated to alleviate
                  common symptoms of menopause.<br>
                  <br>
                  Shifrine, who has spent 15 years investigating
                  olfactory science, suggests, via a natural mechanism
                  he calls HARMONIC OLFACTORY IMMUNITY, that it may, in
                  a patient with COVID-19 coronavirus-infection, be
                  possible to obtain natural antibodies from saliva via
                  a mouth swab and expose the olfactory bulb to them via
                  the nasal passages.&nbsp; This in turn would make
                  direct contact with the brain and therefore would
                  purportedly increase antibody response throughout the
                  body...<br>

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">I have been saying
                  for months now that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)
                  would be an excellent treatment adjunct against severe
                  COVID-19 and a superior alternative to ventilators,
                  which have been shown to cause harm in many patients
                  and increase the risk of death.<br>
                  <br>
                  Mechanical ventilation can easily damage the lungs for
                  the fact that it’s pushing air into the lungs with
                  force in a disease where the alveoli are compromised
                  and filled with fluid from inflammatory cytokines due
                  to insulin resistance. HBOT bypasses this problem by
                  supplying 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which
                  allows your body to bypass this defect and absorb
                  oxygen directly into your tissues.<br>
                  <br>
                  There’s no airflow being forced directly into the
                  lungs. HBOT also improves mitochondrial function,
                  helps with detoxification, inhibits and controls
                  inflammation and optimizes your body’s innate healing
                  capacity.<br>

                  to carry oxygen in addition to the problem to lungs
                  itself. It’s not just lung injury. The virus does
                  something to the red blood cells of certain patients …<br>

                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being inside hyperbaric chambers
                  won’t cause injury. It’s a less invasive way to

                  gastrointestinal symptoms, appetite, headache and
                  mental state.<br>
                  <br>
                  The report also details some of the mechanics behind
                  HBOT and why it benefits COVID-19. Importantly,
                  delivering oxygen under pressure allows for greater
                  oxygen uptake by inflamed lung tissue.<br>
                  <br>
                  It also improves cellular oxygen uptake in general,
                  and to a greater degree than extracorporeal membrane
                  oxygenation (ECMO), which involves oxygenating the
                  patient’s blood outside the body and then pumping it
                  back into circulation.<br>
                  <br>
                  And, while ECMO is recommended6,7 for relatively young
                  patients with few comorbidities who are failing to
                  respond to ventilator treatment, Opelousas General
                  Hospital’s work shows HBOT can successfully be used on
                  older patients who have several comorbidities.
                  Moreover, as noted in the Chinese report, HBOT does
                  not conflict with other conventional means of critical
                  treatment:8<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “HBOT is not the etiological
                  treatment of COVID-19, it is the symptomatic treatment
                  of hypoxia in patients with COVID-19, and it is a
                  supplement to the existing oxygen treatment technology
                  …<br>
                  <br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to HBOT, ICU clinicians
                  are still responsible for the daily comprehensive
                  treatment of the above-mentioned severe patients.
                  There is no conflict in treatment technology. On the
                  contrary, it can provide better support for other
                  supportive treatments.”<br>

                  a clinical trial involving more than 100 covid-19
                  patients in Ecuador has resulted in a claimed 100 cure
                  rate within four days, according to Andreas Kalcker
                  who is closely following the results of the effort.
                  The tests were carried out by the Asociacion
                  Ecuatoriana de Medicos Expertos en Medicina
                  Integrativa, a group of integrative medicine
                  practitioners.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ecuador has been hit particularly hard by the
                  coronavirus, and the current “standard of care”
                  promoted by Western medicine — largely based on the
                  use of ventilators — has been killing the vast
                  majority of critical patients while utterly failing to
                  address the real root of the problem.<br>
                  <br>
                  Covid-19 isn’t an Acute Respiratory Disease (ARD), it
                  turns out. Rather, it often presents as an
                  inflammation and blood clotting condition (see The
                  Lancet research, below) which causes the blood to be
                  unable to carry oxygen, resulting in patient hypoxia
                  and eventual asphyxiation.<br>
                  <br>
                  This is why intravenous chlorine dioxide — which
                  immediately delivers a high dose of oxygen to blood
                  cells — is believed to work so effectively against
                  covid-19. It reportedly restores the oxygen-carrying
                  capacity of hemoglobin and clears the clotting in the
                  lungs, all while destroying pathogens.<br>
                  <br>
                  Chlorine dioxide researcher and advocate Andreas
                  Kalcker has posted a video (in Spanish) where he
                  explains the findings. That video, entitled, “Mas de

                  Andreas explains that researchers were able to achieve
                  a complete cure in just four days through the use of
                  intravenous chlorine dioxide (ClO2). Here’s a photo of
                  some of the researchers holding syringes of chlorine
                  dioxide, which is then infused into the patients’
                  blood, where it releases a wave of oxygen that
                  researchers believe saturates the blood with O2 while
                  killing pathogens:<br>
                  <br>
                  Another clinical trial involving chlorine dioxide is
                  currently under way, documented by the US National
                  Library of Medicine at ClinicalTrials.gov. The study
                  uses oral chlorine dioxide (rather than intravenous)
                  and is entitled, “Determination of the Effectiveness
                  of Oral Chlorine Dioxide in the Treatment of COVID
                  19.” The trial is being conducted by the Genesis
                  Foundation and involves 20 patients.<br>

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">Andreas Kalcker
                  explains in his video that chlorine dioxide is a
                  powerful disinfectant that destroys viruses and
                  bacteria. The substance has long been used in water
                  purification processes and is approved by various US
                  government agencies for as a water treatment and

                  </font></b><font color="#000000">In another bombshell
                  science paper published May 7, 2020, in The Lancet,
                  researchers Dennis McGonagle and others determined
                  that covid-19 is not a respiratory disease but rather
                  “diffuse pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy,” a kind
                  of blood clotting that presents in lung tissue.<br>
                  <br>
                  This explains why patients with covid-19 are dying
                  from hypoxia (lack of oxygen) and are frequently
                  killed by the use of ventilators. As an ICU doctor
                  from New York warned months ago, doctors are treating
                  the wrong disease. (That doctor’s YouTube channel was
                  deleted and all his videos were censored, of course.
                  No one is allowed to question medical orthodoxy in the
                  medical police state known as the United States of
                  America.)<br>
                  <br>
                  Study authors also found the inflammation triggers a
                  worsening of the condition, which implies that
                  anti-inflammatory interventions might be the key to
                  saving lives and ending the pandemic. From the study:<br>
                  <br>
                  The immune mechanism underlying diffuse alveolar and
                  pulmonary interstitial inflammation in COVID-19
                  involves a MAS-like state that triggers extensive
                  immunothrombosis…<br>
                  <br>
                  MAS stands for Macrophage Activation Syndrome, and it
                  is an inflammatory response stemming from an
                  over-reactive immune response, similar to the
                  “cytokine storm” that’s being widely discussed (which
                  vitamin C helps prevent, according to published
                  research). As the study explains:<br>
                  <br>
                  The severity of systemic inflammation in response to
                  human coronavirus family members has features
                  reminiscent of a cytokine storm or macrophage
                  activation syndrome (MAS), also known as secondary
                  haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis (sHLH).<br>
                  <br>
                  o simplify these findings, covid-19 is not acute viral
                  pneumonia impacting the respiratory system but rather
                  an inflammation-based immunological response that
                  leads to thrombosis (clotting in the lungs) which
                  kills the patient. The use of ventilators only makes
                  the problem worse, which is why previous observational
                  studies have found that 88% of patients put on
                  ventilators end up dying. They are dying because the
                  ventilator treatment is the wrong treatment.<br>
                  <br>
                  Chlorine dioxide is reportedly saving 100 percent of
                  the patients studied so far because chlorine dioxide
                  floods the blood with instantly usable oxygen while
                  killing the pathogens responsible for clotting. There
                  is also anecdotal evidence that some people are
                  beating covid-19 infections with high doses of
                  aspirin, a blood thinner, although this information
                  should not be taken as advice for treatment, and far
                  more research is needed on blood thinners and
                  anti-inflammatory interventions...<br>

                  student, successfully cured her of the virus with the
                  “master” antioxidant glutathione....<br>
                  <br>
                  Remembering a remedy that worked for his 16-year-old
                  sister, who was struck with a mystery ailment back in
                  2015 that left her unable to walk and that later
                  turned out to be Lyme disease, James decided to try it
                  on his mom – and the results were astounding.<br>
                  <br>
                  It was actually Dr. Richard Horowitz, a Lyme disease
                  specialist and ally of James who helped treat his
                  sister Julia, who came up with the idea to give
                  Josephine glutathione, which almost immediately gave
                  her back the life she previously had.<br>
                  <br>
                  “When you get a viral infection with a huge amount of
                  inflammation you don’t have enough glutathione to be
                  able to protect your very sensitive lung tissue,”
                  Horowitz stated, noting that glutathione works very
                  well in Lyme patients to reduce inflammation.<br>
                  <br>
                  After giving Josephine her first 2,000-milligram dose
                  of glutathione, Joseph observed that his mother became
                  a whole new person.<br>
                  <br>
                  “Within an hour my breathing got better,” Josephine
                  recalled. “It was amazing. I sat up, I got up. I went
                  and I took a shower,” she added, noting that she was
                  even able to make her own bed.<br>
                  <br>
                  After five days of taking glutathione, Josephine had
                  no relapse back to the pain and suffering she endured
                  while infected with the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19),
                  which left her bound to a wheelchair.<br>

          <b><b><br>
            </b></b>[0012] The antibiotic effects of UV-A and UV-B light
          is induced via damage to haploid DNA/RNA of microorganisms
          such as bacteria, archaea, fungi, yeast and viruses within
          minutes.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] UV light is even capable of stopping the disease
          process in prion-related diseases that currently has no cure.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] [0006] However, mammalian diploid DNA is significantly
          more resistant to such damage.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] For example, it takes decades of direct sun exposure
          for select individuals with relevant gene susceptibility and
          skin type to develop precancerous skin lesions.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] UV phototherapy is widely being used in management of
          skin diseases, such as, for example, psoriasis, vitiligo,
          atopic dermatitis, eczema, Kaposi sarcoma, lichen planus, skin
          lymphoma, neonatal jaundice, and the like. Such process has
          been proposed and used as adenomatous polyp detection tool on
          colonoscopy and also has been proposed in conjunction with a
          super glue for closing patent foramen ovale.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] [0007] Considering the anti-inflammatory and antibiotic
          effects of UV-A and UV-B light, it has the potential to
          revolutionize the management of non-dermatologic (i.e.,
          internal organs) infections and inflammatory diseases. While
          UV light has traditionally been used to treat skin disorders,
          it has not yet been developed for broader infection or
          inflammation treatment in vivo.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] [0008] Accordingly, a system has been developed as
          described herein for emission of therapeutic doses of UV light
          using vehicles, such as, for example, a catheter, capsule,
          endoscope, tube or port, for treating or managing internal
          infections and/or inflammatory conditions inside a patient.
          For instance, in some examples, the inventors developed
          devices that can deliver therapeutic doses of UV light in the
          UV-AB range from a catheter, WO 2017/210366 PCT/US2017/035316

          <br>
          Dr. Christopher Voscopoulos, ICU medical director at Southern
          Hills Hospital in Las Vegas, explains how the ‘proning’
          treatment takes pressure off the lungs by turning the patient
          onto their stomach...<br>
          <br>
          "What proning is, is that normally we have patients lie on
          their back," he explained. "When they lie on their back, their
          heart applies pressure on the back of their lungs and it
          closes off those lungs just a little."<br>
          <br>
          "And, what we do is we simply turn people over and they lie on
          their stomach. By doing that, the heart falls off the lungs
          and opens up a little bit more of the lung," he stated
          further. "You have to remember that these are people fighting
          for their life. And so, when we open up a little more lung,
          that's the difference between life and death."..<br>

          <br>
          Now, thanks to the Lung Flute, you can breathe easier.<br>
          <br>
          The Lung Flute is indicated for Positive Expiratory Pressure
          therapy, which is an important part of BHT. BHT can be used
          for a variety for congestive conditions such as: COPD,
          bronchitis, pneumonia, asthma, emphysema or other chronic
          respiratory ailments.<br>
          <br>
          When you endure lung congestion with thick, chronic mucus that
          is difficult to break up, breathing can be a constant
          struggle. You may have to rely on medications, inhalers,
          oxygen therapy or even surgery to open up your airways.
          Everyday activities can become an effort.<br>
          <br>
          The Lung Flute from Medical Acoustics can help.<br>
          <br>
          The FDA-cleared Lung Flute is the only product that uses sound
          vibration to stimulate your body's natural mucus-clearing
          system – effectively thinning and dislodging mucus deep in the
          lungs so that it's easier to cough up. The small, reusable,
          plastic device is non-invasive, easy to use and drug-free –
          just blow into the mouthpiece and the device will do the rest.<br>
          <br>
          Clinical tests have proven the Lung Flute's ability to break
          up mucus in the lungs, making it equally effective for both
          therapeutic and diagnostic use. Unlike other devices, which
          rely on pressure and can't reach deep lung mucus, the Lung
          Flute's technology is based on low-frequency acoustic waves
          that are produced when you blow into the flute-shaped device.<br>

          A federal court in Utah has order a halt to the sale of a

          fraudulently touted as a treatment for the coronavirus.<br>
          <br>
          Its promoters claim the product will "usher" the coronavirus
          out of the body and protect from infections.<br>
          <br>
          The temporary restraining order Tuesday came in response to a
          civil complaint in Salt Lake City against defendants Gordon
          Pedersen of Cedar Hills and his companies, My Doctor Suggests
          LLC and GP Silver LLC.<br>

          "Even in a time of great uncertainty, there are at least two
          unchanging realities. There are those who would unlawfully
          exploit our vulnerabilities, and there are those who will hold

          "COVID-19 is a dangerous disease, and American consumers must
          have accurate and reliable information as they make important
          health decisions," he said.<br>
          <br>
          The company claimed that once silver nanoparticles are in the
          bloodstream they can block the virus from attaching to cells.<br>
          <br>
          The DOJ said the civil complaint "alleges that the defendants
          are fraudulently promoting and selling various silver products
          for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19."<br>
          <br>
          "The court’s order temporarily enjoins the defendants from
          continuing to sell or distribute their silver products for the
          diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any
          disease, including COVID-19," the DOJ said.<br>
          <br>
          The defendants' assets also were frozen to preserve the
          court’s ability to grant effective final relief, the DOJ said.<br>
          <br>
          "The Department of Justice will take swift action to protect
          consumers from those who would recklessly exploit this public

          Jody Hunt of the Department of Justice’s Civil Division. “We
          work closely with our partners at the Food and Drug
          Administration and will move quickly to shut down schemes that
          promote and sell unlawful products during this pandemic.”<br>
          <br>
          Authorities explained they suspected a scheme to defraud
          consumers by selling silver products based on "fraudulent
          claims of protection against, and treatment for, COVID-19."<br>
          <br>
          Prosecutors allege the defendants "have made a wide variety of
          false and misleading claims touting silver products as a
          preventative for COVID-19, including that having silver in the
          bloodstream will 'usher' any coronavirus out of the body and
          that 'it has been proven that Alkaline Structured Silver will
          destroy all forms of viruses, it will protect people from the
          coronavirus.'"<br>
          <br>
          "The FDA will continue to help ensure those who place profits
          above the public health during the COVID-19 pandemic are
          stopped,” said Judy McMeekin, Pharm.D., associate commissioner
          for Regulatory Affairs, U.S. Food and Drug Administration. “We
          are fully committed to working with the Department of Justice
          to take appropriate action against those jeopardizing the
          health of Americans by offering and distributing products with
          unproven claims to prevent or treat COVID-19.”<br>

          <b>Abstract</b><br>
          In this study, 221 phytocompounds were evaluated for activity
          against anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome associated
          coronavirus (SARS-CoV) activities using a cell-based assay
          measuring SARS-CoV-induced cytopathogenic effect on Vero E6
          cells. Ten diterpenoids (1−10), two sesquiterpenoids (11 and
          12), two triterpenoids (13 and 14), five lignoids (15−19),
          curcumin (20), and reference controls niclosamide (21) and
          valinomycin (22) were potent inhibitors at concentrations
          between 3.3 and 10 μM. The concentrations of the 22 compounds
          to inhibit 50% of Vero E6 cell proliferation (CC50) and viral
          replication (EC50) were measured. The selective index values
          (SI = CC50/EC50) of the most potent compounds 1, 5, 6, 8, 14,
          and 16 were 58, &gt;510, 111, 193, 180, and &gt;667,
          respectively. Betulinic acid (13) and savinin (16) were
          competitive inhibitors of SARS-CoV 3CL protease with Ki values
          = 8.2 ± 0.7 and 9.1 ± 2.4 μM, respectively. Our findings
          suggest that specific abietane-type diterpenoids and lignoids
          exhibit strong anti-SARS-CoV effects.<br>

                Superbugs, COVID 19 with Waterless Cold Steam not Hot</b></font><br>
          </div>
          <font color="#000000"><br>
            Our Answer superbugs, deadly pathogens is BASE Sterilizer’s
            Dial-1 “Cold Steam.” Sterilizes a variation of deadly
            pathogens and micro-organism, and now possibly COVID-19 when
            our lab reports return. We are for sure it can but the data
            is very much required. BASE Sterilizer was architecturally
            invented in Brantford, Ontario: It’s a Cold Steam technology
            which is a surface germ sterilization, eradication,
            decontamination and extraction technology. The current 4 or
            6 chamber models are being modified into a super 6 chamber
            technology whereby they are set at 1,200 Degrees F as
            opposed to 500 degrees F. Although with the dial set at 1
            for cold steam it's ambient to the touch or cold. Capable of
            lifting, killing and extracting deadly pathogens and
            superbugs and more. This 1,200 degree F. Models could easily
            kill anything in 30-20 seconds, the silver Bullet effect for
            surface and food packaging sterilization. The current 500
            Degrees F. 6 Chamber 2nd model was lab tested at a major
            University for 13 months in Canada, proving its
            effectiveness, paid for by the NSERC. One of its advantages
            is that it uses just plain purified distilled water (no
            chemicals). Cold steam has no threat to humans or sensitive
            electronics even if ingested. Hence it's ideal for indoor
            surface sterilization even during the day-time with everyone
            in place and computers operating. It has a blue stream at
            the nozzle because of super flash evaporation and the reason
            why why it’s called "Cold Steam.“ A new more advanced
            entrant of steam technology coined B.A.S.E.S. which is an
            acronym for "BICCSAN Air Surface Extraction Sterilizer." Any
            other Antimicrobial cleansing technology must meet this same
            technology standard to be competitive with the BASE
            Sterilizer’s Cold Steam dial. Able to sterilize any facility
            even while using a personal sterilization accessory or a
            walkthrough similar to a car wash effect. Ideal for
            residential, commercial aircraft &amp; water vessels to name
            a few wherever people gather. Including Mining facilities,
            food packaging plants and secondary containment systems,
            industrial treatment plants as well as optimization for
            industrial processes, and more. The 6 chambers 500 Degree F.
            Model requires about 10 kW of energy. Whereas the (1,200
            Degree F.) model about 14 kW. I spent another 8 years in
            developing their own off-the-grid power supply, completed as
            an option. Able to also power homes and other facilities off
            the grid especially for Hospitals in isolated areas such as
            powerless islands, Sincerely, Gerald B/P.<br>

          <br>
          The 2019-nCov (coronavirus) epidemic originated in Wuhan,
          China and is now spreading to many other continents and
          countries, causing a public fear. Worst of all, there is no
          vaccine or specific antiviral drugs for 2019-nCov available.
          This adds to the public fear and gloomy outlook. A quick,
          rapidly deployable and accessible, effective and also safe
          treatment is urgently needed to not only save those patients,
          to curtail the spread of the epidemic, but also very important
          in the psychological assurance to people worldwide, and to the
          Chinese in particular. Acute organ failure, especially
          pulmonary failure (acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS)
          is the key mechanism for 2019-nCov's fatality. Significantly
          increased oxidative stress due to the rapid release of free
          radicals and cytokines etc. is the hallmark of ARDS which
          leads to cellular injury, organ failure and death. Early use
          of large dose antioxidants, especially vitamin C (VC),
          therefore, plays a key role in the management of these
          patients. We call upon all those in the leadership, and those
          providing direct assistance patients, to bravely and rapidly
          apply large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to help those
          patients and to stop this epidemic. ...<br>

          “The innovative method of specialists at Taleqani hospital of
          Abadan on 30 coronavirus patients reduced to zero the death
          rate of patients in acute health conditions,” Deputy Head of
          Abadan University of Medical Sciences for Training and
          Research Sara Mobarak told FNA on Thursday.<br>
          <br>
          She said that the new drug-based method was first tested on 5
          patients hospitalized at an ICU ward which helped them recover
          and be moved to the general section, adding that in the second
          phase, the medicine was applied to 10 coronavirus patients in
          the ICU ward with low levels of consciousness.<br>
          <br>
          The drugs showed desirable effects on the second group of the
          patients too and the level of their consciousness increased,
          Mobarak said.<br>
          <br>
          She added that the drug combination has not been used in China
          or any other country before, noting that an essay about the
          results of the innovative application of the medicine on
          coronavirus patients in Iran will be released in scientific
          journals.<br>
          <br>
          Also, last week, officials informed that Iranian researchers
          had discovered a medicinal compound which could treat the
          damage inflicted on lungs due to coronavirus infection.<br>
          <br>
          “The new medicinal compound is not special to the coronavirus
          patients, but it treats respiratory and pulmonary diseases,”
          Chairman of the Biotechnology Development Council of Iran
          Mostafa Qaneyee said in a press conference.<br>
          <br>
          He added that the new medicinal compound can decrease the time
          a coronavirus patient needs to stay at hospital to 4 days,
          noting that 40% of Iranian patients who received the
          combination of three drugs have been discharged from hospital
          in less than 4 days.<br>
          <br>
          “In this treatment method, in addition to the protocols of the

          After doing additional scientific research into this subject,
          it seems to me that the severity of COVID-19 contagion in any
          particular person may be largely dependent on nitric oxide
          bioavailability in that person. Moreover, there is reason to
          believe that certain micronutrient deficiencies, such as with
          selenium, can result in increased COVID-19 disease severity
          that goes beyond what you might associate with sub-optimal
          nitric oxide bioavailability.<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A NYC physician named Cameron Kyle-Sidell
          has posted two videos on YouTube, pleading for health
          practitioners to recognize that COVID-19 is not a
          pneumonia-like disease at all. It’s an oxygen deprivation
          condition, and the use of ventilators may be doing more harm
          than good with some patients. The ventilators themselves, due
          to the high-pressure methods they are running, may be damaging
          the lungs and leading to widespread harm of patients.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Cameron Kyle-Sidell describes himself
          as an “ER and critical care doctor” for NYC. “In these nine
          days I have seen things I have never seen before,” he says.
          Before publishing his video, we confirmed that Dr. Kyle-Sidell
          is an emergency medicine physician in Brooklyn and is
          affiliated with the Maimonides Medical Center located in
          Brooklyn.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his video (see below), he goes on to
          warn the world that the entire approach to treating COVID-19
          may be incorrect, and that the disease is something completely
          different from what the dogmatic medical establishment is
          claiming.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “In treating these patients, I have
          witnessed medical phenomena that just don’t make sense in the
          context of treating a disease that is supposed to be a viral
          pneumonia,” he explains.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He talks about how he opened a critical
          care using expecting to be treating patients with a viral
          pneumonia infection that would progress into Acute Respiratory
          Distress Syndrome (ARDS). But that the disease acted nothing
          like ARDS. “This is the paradigm that every hospital in the
          country is working under,” he warns. “And yet, everything I’ve
          seen in the last nine days, all the things that just don’t
          make sense, the patients I’m seeing in front of me, the lungs
          I’m trying to improve, have led me to believe that COVID-19 is
          not this disease, and that we are operating under a medical
          paradigm that is untrue.”<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More from Dr. Kyle-Sidell: (emphasis added)<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, I believe we are treating the
          wrong disease, and I fear that this misguided treatment will
          lead to a tremendous amount of harm to a great number of
          people in a very short time… I feel compelled to give this
          information out.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see,
          is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one. Rather,
          it appears as if some kind of viral-induced disease most
          resembling high altitude sickness. Is it as if tens of
          thousands of my fellow New Yorkers are on a plane at 30,000
          feet at the cabin pressure is slowly being let out. These
          patients are slowly being starved of oxygen.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And while [patients] absolutely look like
          patients on the brink of death, they do not look like patients
          dying from pneumonia… I suspect that the patients I’m seeing
          in front of me, look as if a person was dropped off on the top
          of Mt. Everest without time to acclimate.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He goes on to explain that ventilators, in
          some cases, may be doing far more harm than good.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we treat people with ARDS, we
          typically use ventilators to treat respiratory failure. But
          these patients’ muscles work fine. I fear that if we are using
          a false paradigm to treat a new disease, then the method that
          we program [into] the ventilator, one based on respiratory
          failure as opposed to oxygen failure, that this method being
          widely adopted … aims to increase pressure on the lungs in
          order to open them up, is actually doing more harm than good,
          and that the pressure we are providing to lungs, we may be
          providing to lungs that cannot take it. And that the ARDS that
          we are seeing, may be nothing more than lung injury caused by
          the ventilator.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are hundreds of thousands of lungs in
          this country at risk.<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, the real disease appears to
          cause oxygen deprivation in victims, not pneumonia. This is
          critically important for all the obvious reasons, and it
          raises huge questions about the origins of the coronavirus and
          whether there is some additional external factor beyond the
          virus that may be causing a combined effect that results in
          severe oxygen deprivation.<br>

              treating coronavirus patient with natural oxygen therapy</b><br>
            <b>By Ethan Huff</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          In a breakthrough for eradicating the Wuhan coronavirus
          (CoVid-19), South Korean officials have successfully treated a
          patient using all-natural oxygen therapy.<br>
          <br>
          Unlike our own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
          (CDC), which only advocates for pharmaceuticals and vaccines,
          Korea’s CDC effectively cured, dare we use that word, a
          patient by delivering oxygen through a face mask, according to
          the local news service Newsis.<br>
          <br>
          Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of Korea’s CDC, announced that only
          one of South Korea’s 21 remaining Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19)
          patients is still in critical condition, while the rest have
          been released.<br>
          <br>
          As for the oxygen therapy, Jeong explained that it effectively
          saturates a patient’s body with oxygen by delivering high
          doses of it. And as we’ve reported in the past, diseases of
          all kinds hate oxygen and simply can’t survive in its
          presence.<br>
          <br>
          With this successful treatment, South Korea is confident that
          there are no additional “critically ill” patients within its
          border, despite earlier concerns that the virus might ravage
          high-risk patients...<br>

            <i>Zinc is no COVID-19 magic bullet, but it has shown to
              help with other coronaviruses.</i><br>
            <b>By Todd Neff</b><br>

          Calling the specific virus that is causing COVID-19
          “coronavirus” is a bit like calling the Ford Explorer “the
          SUV.” Both statements are true, but with both, one is part of
          the other. There are lots of different SUVs; there are lots of
          different coronaviruses.<br>
          <br>
          Zinc is something that will not hurt you, and there may be
          some benefit when it comes to COVID-19, like with other
          coronaviruses. Photo: Getty Images.<br>
          <br>
          Many common colds are caused by coronaviruses. Various
          scientific studies (we’ll get to those in a moment) have shown
          zinc lozenges to be effective in shortening the misery phase
          of common colds. So in the face of a coronavirus pandemic,
          here’s a big question many are asking: can zinc shorten the
          duration of – or even diminish the symptom load and thereby
          lessen the impact – of COVID-19?<br>
          <br>
          The answer is we don’t know yet. But to twist the analogy: if
          changing the oil helps a Jeep Grand Cherokee avoid the shop,
          it’s a good bet that doing the same will benefit the Ford
          Explorer, too.<br>
          <br>
          Dr. Ian Tullberg bears no responsibility for the above
          comparison. But as far as helping patients get over colds,
          “there’s good evidence that oral zinc works well,” the medical
          director of UCHealth Medical Group Urgent Care said.<br>
          <br>
          With respect to the specific coronavirus that is causing the
          pandemic now, “the problem is that this is still so early that
          we don’t have the knowledge if it works or not,” Tullberg
          said. “However, zinc is something that will not hurt you, and
          there may be some benefit.”<br>
          <br>
          Those who swear by zinc as a cold remedy know to take it when
          they first start to feel a scratchy throat. They try to hit it
          early – right when the cold’s coming on. Research spanning
          decades has shown that using zinc lozenges through the course
          of the cold does make a difference.<br>
          <br>
          <b>The data around Zinc and coronaviruses</b><br>
          <br>
          A study published in 1996 shuffled 100 Cleveland Clinic
          employees who self-reported catching colds into two groups.
          Fifty took lozenges containing 13.3 milligrams of zinc
          gluconate – the dosage of today’s Cold-Eeze and other
          over-the-counter lozenges – every two hours as long as they
          had cold symptoms. Fifty others took placebo lozenges. The
          study was double-blind, so neither patients nor researchers
          knew which patients had the placebo. The findings: the zinc
          group cleared symptoms more than three days earlier – 4.4 days
          versus 7.6 days of the placebo group, and, until that point,
          suffered fewer days with cough, headache, hoarseness, nasal
          congestion, and sore throat (fever, muscle aches, scratchy
          throat and sneezing remained similar during the cold’s
          duration). Zinc has side effects – “bad-taste reactions”
          (understandable) and, among 20 percent of those taking zinc,
          nausea.<br>
          <br>
          That study wasn’t, it turned out, a fluke. A Cochrane review
          updated in 2013 summarized 18 randomized controlled trials
          involving 1,781 participants across all age groups found that
          zinc – particularly in lozenge or syrup form – “inhibits
          replication of the virus” that cause the common cold and
          shortens average duration of the common cold when taken within
          24 hours of onset of symptoms at a dose of more than 75
          milligrams a day.<br>
          <br>
          A 2010 study led by University of Leiden Medical researchers
          in the Netherlands sought to understand how zinc inhibited
          that replication. The team reported that zinc inhibits a
          cousin of SARS-CoV-2: SARS-CoV, the original SARS of the 2003
          outbreak. Click through for details, which get into the
          biochemical nitty-gritty, but the gist is that zinc throws a
          wrench in the virus’s RNA-synthesis machine.<br>
          <br>
          Now, there are caveats with zinc. First, like everything else,
          there can be too much of a good thing – more than 150
          milligrams a day for adult. That’s about 11 lozenges; the
          recommended zinc-lozenge maximum for adults being six and just
          four for children ages 12-17 (research has shown younger
          children to not benefit from taking zinc). Second, zinc nasal
          sprays shouldn’t be used, Tullberg says. In 2009, the U.S.
          Food and Drug Administration warned against such products
          because people who used them lost their sense of smell.<br>
          <br>
          What does that background say about the effectiveness of zinc
          and the SARS-CoV-2 now known as coronavirus? It is, at best,
          effectiveness by association. But an email that recently went
          viral as a blog post indicates that Tullberg is in good
          company with his openness to zinc lozenges as a way to at
          least try and mitigate COVID-19 flu symptoms.<br>
          <br>
          A virologist’s take on Zinc and COVID-19<br>
          <br>
          The email was one that James A. Robb sent to friends and
          family. He is University of Colorado School of Medicine MD, a
          pathologist, and molecular virologist who, while at the
          University of California, San Diego in the 1970s, did
          pioneering work in understanding coronaviruses. He wrote:<br>
          <br>
          Stock up now with zinc lozenges. These lozenges have been
          proven to be effective in blocking coronavirus (and most other
          viruses) from multiplying in your throat and nasopharynx. Use
          as directed several times each day when you begin to feel ANY
          “cold-like” symptoms beginning. It is best to lie down and let
          the lozenge dissolve in the back of your throat and
          nasopharynx. Cold-Eeze lozenges is one brand available, but
          there are other brands available.<br>
          <br>
          Snopes.com, a website dedicated to debunking (or confirming)
          internet myths, investigated after his words were twisted by
          others and reposted with exaggerated claims such as zinc being
          a “silver bullet” against coronavirus. In an email to Snopes,
          Robb confirmed that he’d written the above and added, “In my
          experience as a virologist and pathologist, zinc will inhibit
          the replication of many viruses, including coronaviruses. I
          expect COVID-19 will be inhibited similarly, but I have no
          direct experimental support for this claim. I must add,
          however, that using zinc lozenges as directed by the
          manufacturer is no guarantee against being infected by the
          virus, even if it inhibits the viral replication in the
          nasopharynx.”<br>
          <br>
          In short, if coronavirus is like an SUV, zinc lozenges may
          well be something like an oil change, though we’ll need many
          more miles to really know for sure.<br>

          </div>
          <br>
          The invention relates to the field of preventive or curative
          control against diseases of viral origin in humans or animals.<br>
          <br>
          The virulicidal properties of certain metal salts, such as
          zinc or lithium salts, are already known.<br>
          <br>
          Thus the publication "Effect of Zinc Ions on the Synthesis of
          Herpes Simplex Virus DNA in infected BSC-1 cells", virology
          66, p. 330-335, 1975, Academic Press, Joseph SHLOMAI, YAEL
          ASHER, YITZHAK J. GORDON, UDY OLSHEVSKY and YECHIEL BECKER,
          describes the antiviral action of zinc sulfate against cells
          infected with the Herpes Simplex DNA virus.<br>
          <br>
          Also, the publication "Zinc Salts that may be effective
          against the AIDS Virus HIV", Medical Hypotheses 1988, 26,
          251-253, Longman Group, W. SERGIO, teaches that zinc, a
          broad-spectrum virulicide, could be considered to combat AIDS.<br>
          <br>
          Nevertheless, it appeared that the high toxicity of zinc salts
          at the doses in which they are active against viruses does not
          allow their administration to be considered in general for
          humans or animals. As a result, the use of zinc salts
          generally against AIDS or other viral infections has not been
          able to be implemented since this publication...<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention, the metal is zinc and / or
          lithium, known for their virulicidal properties, and
          compatible with ascorbic acid. It has indeed been able to
          demonstrate, surprisingly, that metals in the form of
          ascorbate have an extremely low toxicity at doses where they
          nevertheless have sufficient virulicidal power, in particular
          within the meaning of the AFNOR standard. Thus, ascorbate is a
          vector of metals in general administration. And more
          particularly, zinc ascorbate achieves a compromise which makes
          it possible to envisage background treatments with zinc salts,
          generally and at doses where these salts are certainly
          virulicidal.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention, in the case of zinc, proportions
          of zinc ascorbate are used in the pharmaceutical form of the
          composition so that the blood concentration resulting after
          the general administration is greater than 0.125 g / l, the
          upper limit being fixed by the toxicity of zinc ascorbate.
          Indeed, for this value, we see that the virulicidal power of
          zinc ascorbate is total without any side or toxic effect.<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention, in the case of lithium,
          proportions of lithium ascorbate are used in the dosage form
          of the composition so that the resulting blood concentration
          is greater than 2 g / l, in particular of the order of 3 g /
          l...<br>
          <br>
          XAMPLE NO 1: Zinc ascorbate was prepared by salification
          between ascorbic acid and zinc oxide in proportions of 2 moles
          of acid per 1 mole of oxide. 35 parts of ascorbic acid (2 M)
          are dissolved in 150 parts of water. 8 parts of zinc oxide (1
          M) are added when cold (between 0 ° C. and 300 ° C.) and away
          from light, as its solubility is carried out, with continuous
          stirring. The liquor obtained is orange-yellow and has a pH of
          4.6. The liquor is then evaporated under vacuum between 400 C
          and 600 C to obtain a light yellow powder having a molecular
          weight of 415.61.<br>
          <br>
          EXAMPLE NO 2: Lithium ascorbate was prepared by the action of
          ascorbic acid on lithium carbonate in an aqueous medium
          protected from light. 10 parts of ascorbic acid are dissolved
          in 50 parts of cold distilled water. With stirring, 2.1 parts
          of lithium carbonate are gradually added. After the end of the
          reaction, the mixture is left in contact for 12 hours.
          Evaporated under vacuum between 400 C and 600 C. An
          orange-yellow residue of lithium ascorbate is obtained...<br>
          <br>
          The lethal dose 50 (LD 50) was determined according to the
          BEHRENS and KARBER method according to the following formula:
          LD 50 = DmM - zaxb / n, where DmM is the minimum lethal dose,
          at the average difference between two successive doses, b the
          average number of deaths at two successive doses, n the number
          of experimental animals per batch.<br>
          <br>
          5 male and 5 female rats were used. The first case of
          mortality occurred at a dose of 3 g / kg in a female rat. At
          4g / kg one male and 4 females died, and at 6g / kg all of the
          rats died.<br>
          As a result, the LD 50 for oral zinc ascorbate is 4.7 g / kg
          in the male rat and 3.6 g / kg in the female rat....<br>
          <br>
          At 1,000 mg / kg, all animals remained alive<br>

              Powerful Aids for Reducing Inflammation in the Lungs</b><br>
            <b>by Dr. Cass Ingram, D.O.</b><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          What an impressive finding it is and highly newsworthy. It is
          mentioned throughout the news the issue of “cytokine storm”
          and the danger this poses to people. Yet, incredibly, a mere
          wild plant and its essential oil are medicinal beyond all
          drugs, in fact, a litany of them. Wild oregano is a powerhouse
          for reducing inflammation in the tissues. In a number of
          studies it has been found to inhibit the source of this
          condition primarily through its actions on inflammatory
          markers. Actually, the mechanism is truly profound, because
          wild oregano acts on the genes that lead to the synthesis of
          these markers. Repeatedly, it has been shown, oregano oil and
          its active components, including carvacrol and thymol, have
          demonstrated great powers against inflammation. In fact, in
          some studies oregano oil active ingredients were able to drop
          COX-2 inflammation levels by up to 80%.<br>
          <br>
          Today, there is much concern about the inflammation that
          results from overwork of the immune system or might it be
          said, overreactions. In a study on T lymphocytes done via cell
          culture it was found that the wild oregano oil active
          ingredients exhibited a specific molecular action even more
          potent than drugs. Carvacrol and thymol both significantly
          reduced tissue levels of interleukin-2. In fact, the reduction
          was massive, two-thirds in the case of carvacrol. This makes
          it more significant in this regard than any drug. For gamma
          interferon, the reduction was nearly 30%. This proved that the
          oregano oil component modified the activity, that is more
          towards normal, during a crisis event. Correlating this to
          humans aggressive dosing would likely reduce this further.<br>
          <br>
          In the lungs oregano oil has been found to curb reactive
          oxygen species or free radicals. This has led to in asthmatic
          patients a reduction in cytokine overload. Here, it largely
          shuts off the gene responsible for the immunological storm
          reaction. Whether in the lungs or the skin—or the rest of the
          organs—cytokines are no match for the powers of wild oregano.<br>
          <br>
          In another investigation the oil was found to decrease
          inflammation in skin tissue, once again an action thought to
          be due to modulating immune function. Specifically, the oil
          was found to markedly act with actions to block excessive cell
          growth, known as anti proliferative activity, while also
          greatly inhibited markers of inflammation. These markers
          included various cytokines and also gamma interferon. In fact,
          through the powers of this oil nearly all elements associated
          with toxic inflammation are greatly reduced, including various
          collagen-associated molecules, cancer-inducing growth factors,
          and enzymes—the ones that can do us harm.&nbsp; “Strongly
          inhibited” were among the comments made by investigators. As
          well, it was found to decisively block those specialized genes
          directly associated with inflammation. This caused them to
          conclude that oregano oil is a “promising candidate for use”
          against inflammation and cancerous changes in skin tissues.<br>
          <br>
          Also, to reiterate, according to Iranian investigators oregano
          compounds were found to reduce all the serious immune
          modulators. This was through a direct action on the genes.
          This led to a reduction in the excessive activity of T cells.
          The various inflammatory cytokines were significantly
          reduced,&nbsp; including the highly noxious tumor necrosis
          factor alpha. This led the researchers to stated that oregano
          oil would be useful to combat diseases associated with
          over-activity of immunity.<br>
          <br>
          Wild oregano is far from specific to the skin. It helps reduce
          inflammation all throughout the body, including within all
          internal organs. Nothing is an exception to its powers.
          Consider an investigation in artificially induced colitis in
          animals. Treatment of the colitis condition with oregano oil
          decreased levels of all pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
          tumor necrosis factor alpha. A moderate dosage of oregano oil,
          only 1 per 1000, was sufficient to reduce all the key
          interleukin-based inflammation-promoters. The result was
          decreased mortality rate, combined with a better weight gain
          and reduced visible damage to colonic tissue. By influencing
          the genes, that is the production of the messenger form of
          RNA, it was concluded, oregano reverses the colitis pathology,
          a most significant finding.<br>
          <br>
          In every conceivable animal model oregano proves itself
          invaluable. For instance, as shown by Chinese investigators
          oregano-treated pigs had Escherichia coli in the jejunum,
          ileum, and colon than the control. This was thought to be the
          result of the greater inactivation of inflammation, once again
          by curbing inflammatory reactions through a genetic influence.
          Essentially, the oregano shuts off the potentially dangerous
          gene, greatly reducing, even eliminating, toxic markers in the
          intestines. Microscopic analysis proves that the intestinal
          membranes of oregano-treated pigs were far different from
          those in controls, far healthier, even healthier than normal.
          The fact is with the oregano therapy all the inflammatory
          cytokines, the ones capable of causing severe illness, where
          fully depressed.<br>
          <br>
          Black seed oil also offers this action. In a study in the
          Saudi Pharmaceutical Journal it was found to greatly alleviate
          airway restrictions and inflammation of the airways in
          bronchial asthma, once again through cytokine modulation. In
          yet another investigation it acted dramatically against the
          toxicity of artificially induced airway damage, largely by
          halting the immune system-provoked cytokine storm. This was to
          such a degree that black seed was held as a “useful” herbal
          medicine against inflammation and allergy-related lung
          conditions, including shortness of breath and asthma. Fennel
          and cumin were also found to have this action, both of which
          are found in specialized black seed oil capsules. Clearly, the
          spices have a most potent action against inflammatory changes
          in lung tissues.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, when cytokine storm is described and discussed, there is
          no need for fear. It is just an excessive reaction by a
          typically compromised immune system. To halt this, even
          prevent it, wild oregano is the answer. This should be
          consumed as the wild, whole food, Mediterranean-source oil,
          the crude herb, ideally with Rhus coriaria, and the
          juice-essence or hydrosol. All are readily available and make
          the ideal supplements for daily use and prevention and also
          for intake to support a healthy, balanced immune response.
          There is no harm taking such whole food supplements with other
          formulas or even drugs. Wild oregano is the number one
          medicine for human health. Take it to your major benefit, and
          your delight and joy. After all, in Greek “ora-ganos” means
          “delight of the mountains.”<br>

          Canadian researchers launched a study Monday into the use of a
          powerful anti-inflammatory drug to reduce the risks of
          pulmonary complications and death related to the new
          coronavirus.<br>
          <br>
          Several COVID-19 patients have had severe complications from a
          surge of activated immune cells in the lungs — known as a
          “cytokine storm.”<br>
          <br>
          In a cytokine storm, the immune system overreacts and damages
          lung tissue, leading to acute respiratory distress and
          multi-organ failure.<br>
          A team led by Jean-Claude Tardif, director of the Montreal
          Heart Institute research center and professor of medicine at
          the University of Montreal, are hoping the drug colchicine
          will work to moderate the overproduction of immune cells and
          their activating compounds — called cytokines — in COVID-19
          patients.If it proves to be successful, the drug — which is
          already used to treat gout and pericarditis (inflammation of
          the heart membrane), and is readily available and inexpensive
          — could become a key tool in the pandemic fight.<br>
          <br>
          At a news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced
          Can$192 million (US$132 million) in funding for vaccine
          development and production in Canada, as well as several
          partnerships with firms to accelerate clinical trials and the
          eventual production of a vaccine and treatments.<br>
          <br>
          “Once there are promising options, Canada needs the capacity
          to mass produce treatments as quickly as possible,” he said.<br>
          <br>
          Those named by the prime minister included Vancouver’s
          AbCellera, Medicago in Quebec City, and Toronto-based startup
          BlueDot, which used artificial intelligence to flag the
          COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan nine days before the World Health
          Organization, as well as the University of Saskatchewan and
          the National Research Council.<br>
          <br>
          Tardif told public broadcaster Radio-Canada that he hopes to
          know if colchicine is effective in coronavirus patients within
          three months.<br>
          <br>
          He said he became interested in its possible application as a
          COVID-19 fighter when it became clear that most children were
          resistant to the illness.<br>
          <br>
          Children typically have reduced inflammatory responses to
          colds and flus, compared to adults.<br>
          <br>
          In laboratory tests, animals whose inflammatory responses were
          blocked also lived longer after being exposed to influenza.<br>
          <br>
          The hypothesis was worked on by 125 people and Health Canada
          approved the Quebec government-funded study within 24 hours.<br>
          <br>
          According to a heart institute statement, the researchers are
          looking to recruit 6,000 Canadians with the coronavirus, for a
          clinical trial.<br>
          <br>
          But there were only 1,430 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in
          Canada as of 2200 GMT Sunday, including 20 deaths. More than
          100,000 Canadians have been tested, so far.<br>
          <br>
          Trudeau also said the government was accelerating lab tests
          for the virus, and has asked research schools across the
          country for any spare masks and ventilators, while also
          looking at the possibility of 3D printing medical supplies.<br>

              China, within which can be found the following amazing
              statement:<br>
              <br>
              “Hydroxychloroquine is a mature immunosuppressive agent
              for clinical application. It also has anti-inflammatory,
              anti-infective, anti-viral, optical filter, anticoagulant
              effects, and has fewer adverse reactions. It is also a
              basic drug for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
              The research team conducted a clinical analysis of 178
              neocoronavirus patients admitted to the hospital from
              December 2019 and found that none of them were patients
              with systemic lupus erythematosus. Later, in consultation
              with 80 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus treated
              in the dermatology department of the hospital, they were
              found not to be infected with neocoronavirus pneumonia...<br>
              <br>
              “The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ
              and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to
              *CURE* SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and stop the

          <div align="center"><b>News is breaking all over the world
              that chloroquine, a prescription medication used to treat
              malaria, also appears to be effective against the
              coronavirus.</b><br>

          ...Here’s a promising candidate herb that prevents malaria and
          tuberculosis<br>
          <br>
          In the world of natural medicine, there are already powerful,
          well-known treatments against malaria that also happen to
          prevent tuberculosis, an aggressive infection of the
          respiratory tract. While nothing is yet proven to treat
          coronavirus, our review of herbal medicine studies and
          medicinal phytochemicals leads us to the conclusion that this
          Chinese Medicine herb may one day become known as the “natural
          cure” for coronavirus (although clinical trials are needed,
          obviously, to prove this).<br>
          <br>
          The chemical is called artemesinin, and the herb is known as
          sweet wormwood. And no, we don’t sell it. This isn’t a
          commercial promotion, it’s an effort to help save millions of
          lives using medicine that’s available right now, all around
          the world.<br>
          <br>
          Artemesinin is known for its ability to block the bacterial
          strain that causes tuberculosis, known as Mycobacterium
          tuberculosis. That doesn’t mean it prevents coronavirus, which
          is a viral infection, but it’s a strong candidate for a number
          of logical reasons.<br>
          <br>
          According to research published in the journal Phytomedicine,
          artemisinin / sweet wormwood has a “100% cure rate” for
          treating drug-resistant malaria, at least in a small trial
          involving 18 patients (all of whom were cured). As Herbs.news
          writes in this important story:<br>
          <br>
          A study led by Pamela Weathers, a professor of biology and
          biotechnology at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI),
          published in the journal Phytomedicine, describes how the
          Artemisia annua plant, commonly known as sweet wormwood or
          sweet annie, saved 18 patients with drug-resistant malaria
          from the brink of death.<br>
          <br>
          The Congolese patients, who ranged in age from 14 months to 60
          years, had all developed severe, untreatable malaria, with
          symptoms ranging from loss of consciousness, to trouble
          breathing and convulsions, among others. When they failed to
          respond to intravenous treatment with an ACT, compassionate
          doctors decided to try the dried leaves of the Artemisia annua
          plant as a last resort. After only five days of the treatment,
          all 18 patients were fully recovered, including one child who
          had been in a coma. Blood tests revealed that absolutely no
          parasites remained in their blood...<br>

          Chloroquine is effective in preventing the spread of SARS CoV

          observed when the cells were either treated with chloroquine
          prior to or after SARS CoV infection. In addition, the

          Africa has the lowest levels of coronavirus deaths, and I know
          why:<br>
          It is because Africans take hydroxychloroquine on a schedule
          there to prevent malaria, and as a result coronavirus can't
          touch them. One thing about hydroxychloroquine is that it can
          be taken as a preventive measure. You can take it MONTHS
          before being exposed to Coronavirus and you'll be protected.
          That is why the elite scammers and people like Tom Hanks are

          A study of COVID-19 patients in China who received
          hydroxychloroquine showed the anti-malarial drug did not clear
          the patients of the virus.<br>
          <br>
          "The overall 28-day negative conversion rate was not different
          between [standard-of-care] plus [hydroxychloroquine and
          standard-of-care] group (Kaplan-Meier estimates 85.4% versus
          81.3%, P=0.341)," researchers wrote in the study. "Negative
          conversion rate at day 4, 7, 10, 14 or 21 was also similar
          between the two groups. No different 28-day symptoms

          Although several clinical trials are now underway to test

          We report here that Ivermectin, an FDA-approved anti-parasitic
          previously shown to have broad-spectrum anti-viral activity in
          vitro, is an inhibitor of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2),
          with a single addition to Vero-hSLAM cells 2 hours post
          infection with SARS-CoV-2 able to effect ∼5000-fold reduction
          in viral RNA at 48 h. Ivermectin therefore warrants further
          investigation for possible benefits in humans...<br>

          A Plausible "Penny" Costing Effective Treatment for Corona
          Virus - Ozone Therapy<br>
          Robert Jay Rowen, MD1,* and Howard Robins, DPM2<br>
          Abstract<br>
          Many viruses require reduced sulfhydryl groups for cell fusion
          and entry. Corona viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of
          the condition now named coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19),
          are rich in cysteine, which residues must be intact for viral
          activity. Sulfhydryl groups are vulnerable to oxidation. Ozone
          therapy, a very inexpensive and safe modality may safely
          exploit this critical vulnerability in many viruses, inclusive
          of SARS-CoV-2.,,<br>
          Conclusion<br>
          The world already has a most inexpensive, safe, and likely
          effective remedy for deadly viral diseases, which exploits
          their redox vulnerability at critical membrane
          cysteine/tryptophan fusion sites. Ozone therapy could be
          easily deployed worldwide, even in very poor countries. With
          few conventional treatments for viral pneumonia, this epidemic
          could provide impetus to study ozone therapy very ethically
          under the auspices of an institution's review board in
          treating, with ozone therapy, seriously ill patients, who
          might otherwise expire. Milder cases could also be treated to
          study the ability of ozone therapy to slow or halt clinical
          deterioration. Such study could bring ozone therapy to the
          forefront of all-around infectious disease management,
          providing answers to our growing problems with resistant
          infection. Governments should take notice.<br>

              Russia Blames Porton Down, DARPA-Pirbright, CQ vs India's
              Golden Cow Urine - Part 13 COVID</b><br>
            <b>By Yoichi Shimatsu</b><br>

          <div align="left"><b>[ Excerpt re: Chloroquine ]</b><br>
            <b>A "cure" worse than the disease</b><br>
          </div>
          Chloroquine (Aralen), the "COV cure" touted by health
          authorities in China and being hyped in Europe and the USA as
          a proven remedy for patients, at least those who haven't been
          killed by it. Derived from the coal that Greta Thunberg wants
          to banish, CQ is a molecule from the same group as
          anti-malaria quinine.<br>
          <br>
          This panacea has known side-effects including blinding
          patients with retina damage, harming heart muscle tissue,
          scarring of the kidneys and wrecking the stomach and
          intestines, the latter being the source of uncontrolled bloody
          diarrhea, triggering the toilet paper rush. CQ earlier had a
          major role in the high death rate of malaria patients
          worldwide.<br>
          <br>
          The urban myth of younger people having far fewer deaths than
          the elderly is due to a difference in the condition of
          internal organs, which tend to be more worn and damaged in
          older individuals. CQ pushed many an oldster patient into the
          incinerator, meaning those victims were not cured but instead
          "put down" by CQ. This may be fine in the eyes of youth
          revolutionaries with the Extinction Rebellion who revile
          anyone older than 29, so let's rename the killer drug as the
          Greta Pill and their movement as the Human Extermination
          Revolt. Her loyal Gen Z followers now call COV the "boomer
          doomer" virus. So celebrate, air-heads, before trying to
          figure who's going to pay for your shopping sprees.<br>
          <br>
          The bad news for the children's crusade is that the Greta Pill
          carries long-term risks of arthritis, lupus and Sarcodoisis,
          which is an autoimmune inflammation of the lungs, internal
          organs, eyes and, gosh for you pretty Instagram influencers,
          skin discoloration. That, in brief, is what the doctors aren't
          telling you everything about the CQ cure-all, which will soon
          come to seek you.<br>
          <br>
          The last and rather grotesque drawback of chloroquine is
          rendering the internal organs and blood of deceased COV
          patients unfit for withdrawing serum and harvesting their
          organs for sale. That is a terrible waste indeed in terms of
          market economics for doctors, hospitals, crematoriums,
          transporters and others involved in the human-parts recycling
          industry. As a consequence, China being the model of
          exploitative hyper-capitalism, is a black market paradise for
          recovered patients' blood serum...<br>
          <br>
          <b>Ayurveda gold standard against COV</b><br>
          The only genuine answer is inside a natural liquid of ancient
          vintage. The potential defense against life-threatening COV
          comes from Ayurveda therapy, well, broadly defined, being
          dispensed in gallons by humped Desi cows in India. Bovine
          urine is being splashed on by Hindus as an effective shield
          against viral infection. Does that seem disgusting and
          ridiculous? Well, at least nobody gets killed for their blood
          serum, and COV infections have been rare across the densely
          populated country.<br>
          <br>
          One of the readers of rense.com on the Subcontinent urged me
          to look over Captain Ajit Vadakayil's blog on cow urine's
          active ingredient, which is nano gold colloids. At first
          impression I assumed it was some sort of superstitious
          nonsense and that I should not be taken in by a scam from the
          Rashneeshees or the Beatles' Maharishi Mahesh yogi. Then on
          second thought, based on sojourns in Thailand for herbal-based
          therapy for radioactive exposure during Fukushima research, I
          remembered that Ayurvedic herbs including
          lemongrass-citronella, kaffir lime and turmeric enabled my
          return to health from the doorstep of death, as compared with
          the total impotence of modern pharmacology against
          radioactivity. The gut reaction to overcome, however, is that
          the gold nano-particles are inside cow urine...<br>
          <br>
          These are super-bovines with tens of thousands of years of
          coexistence with nomadic tribes and later agrarian villages.
          Despite befouled water, their resistance to disease is
          astounding, indicative of a powerful immune system that
          protects the wholesome purity of their milk, usually consumed
          as yogurt or ghee butter. This is why mother cows are
          considered sacred by Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Parsi
          (Zoroastrians). Cows transfer antibodies and other biological
          defenses to their calves suckling milk, as opposed to the soy
          water fed to young cattle in the West by dairymen extracting
          every last penny to pay the grain companies and equipment
          suppliers, while still slipping into debt.<br>
          <br>
          These cows drink from natural sources like "dirty" rivers,
          lakes and wells in a barren countryside that is eroded down to
          lots of rocky outcrops, from whence the gold nano-particles
          are derived. With that memory in mind, I decided to consult a
          microbiologist adviser with a ridiculous question about the
          efficacy of nano gold. The supportive response was that he had
          done lab studies on gold nanoparticle therapy some 20 years
          ago, and yes it does live up to the claims. Gobsmacked was I
          by that revelation of gold being a virus-destroyer with Shiva
          power on a nano-dimension.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Nano-gold therapy</b><br>
          Although invisible to the naked eye, nano gold seen through a
          powerful electron microscope is not yellow or white but
          instead red or violet, due to its bonding as a salt with
          chlorine or silicon. AuCl is one of many salts of gold (like
          NaCL or sodium chloride). My adviser's research studies has
          shown that nano-colloidal gold salts can control gene
          expression in RNA and facilitate cancer drug delivery. Its
          bonding and electrical properties at the nano level defy our
          conventional assumption that gold is pure and resistant to
          chemical reactions, being symbolic of marital fidelity in the
          exchange of golden rings.<br>
          <br>
          At the micro-scale of 10 nanometers up to 40 nm, ions of gold
          have strong bonding capability along with powerful electrical
          properties. Inside your bloodstream, charged ions of gold-salt
          can organize bits of proteins into structures called ligands,
          especially when augmented with a target-detecting monoclonal
          antibody. The ligand can attract and take control over
          message-conveying proteins called cytokines. The exchange of
          signals with the cytokines enables the gold ligands to hunt
          down specific pathogens. For example, in the battle against
          hepatitis, the ligand organizes teams of cytokines to rally
          antibodies against that infectious virus. Gold ligands, in
          brief, are the magic bullet against the m.tuberculosis and HIV
          strands in COVID-19, along with the vulnerable Spike proteins
          jutting out of its membrane.<br>
          <br>
          Once the ligand reaches a cluster of viruses, the gold
          nano-particle captures the RNA strands of viruses, pinning
          these to its surface with polyvalent or multiple bonds. This
          counterattack is launched during the virus replication process
          when exposing its single-strand RNA or, alternatively, as a
          double-strand during transcription (producing a copy of
          itself).<br>
          <br>
          The capture process is completed with "passivation" though
          addition of ethylene glycol and alkyl-thiol molecules, which
          "root" the viruses preventing their escape. For 2-dimensional
          visual representation purposes, the gold orb resembles an axle
          while the RNA strands stick out like spokes of a wheel.<br>
          <br>
          Then what? That's where urine comes into play fortuitously,
          since the RNA-loaded nano particle is tiny enough to pass from
          the blood stream into the kidneys and out of the patient's
          body. Voila! No side effects or internal organ damage, a clean
          sweep. There are no apparent defensive mechanisms in the
          HIV-COV-mTB bioengineered virus capable of fleeing, repelling,
          resisting or combating the gold-salt particle. My microbiology
          adviser points out that the bio-engineered COVID-19 is clunky,
          more cumbersome and slower to replicate than SARS due to the
          spliced-in HIV and m.TB components...<br>

            <b>Abstract</b><br>
            Griffithsin (GRFT), an algae-derived lectin, is one of the
            most potent viral entry inhibitors discovered to date. It is
            currently being developed as a microbicide with
            broad-spectrum activity against several enveloped viruses.
            GRFT can inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
            infection at picomolar concentrations, surpassing the
            ability of most anti-HIV agents. The potential to inhibit
            other viruses as well as parasites has also been
            demonstrated. Griffithsin’s antiviral activity stems from
            its ability to bind terminal mannoses present in
            high-mannose oligosaccharides and crosslink these glycans on
            the surface of the viral envelope glycoproteins. Here, we
            review structural and biochemical studies that established
            mode of action and facilitated construction of GRFT analogs,
            mechanisms that may lead to resistance, and in vitro and
            pre-clinical results that support the therapeutic potential
            of this lectin.<br>
