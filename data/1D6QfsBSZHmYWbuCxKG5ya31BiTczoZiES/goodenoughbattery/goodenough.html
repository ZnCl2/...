      <div align="center"><b>Lithium-Ion Battery Inventor Introduces New
          Technology for Fast-Charging, Noncombustible Batteries</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A team of engineers led by 94-year-old John Goodenough, professor
      in the Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas
      at Austin and co-inventor of the lithium-ion battery, has
      developed the first all-solid-state battery cells that could lead
      to safer, faster-charging, longer-lasting rechargeable batteries
      for handheld mobile devices, electric cars and stationary energy
      storage. <br>
      <br>
      Goodenough’s latest breakthrough, completed with Cockrell School
      senior research fellow Maria Helena Braga, is a low-cost
      all-solid-state battery that is noncombustible and has a long
      cycle life (battery life) with a high volumetric energy density
      and fast rates of charge and discharge. The engineers describe
      their new technology in a recent paper published in the journal
      Energy &amp; Environmental Science.<br>
      <br>
      “Cost, safety, energy density, rates of charge and discharge and
      cycle life are critical for battery-driven cars to be more widely
      adopted. We believe our discovery solves many of the problems that
      are inherent in today’s batteries,” Goodenough said.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers demonstrated that their new battery cells have at
      least three times as much energy density as today’s lithium-ion
      batteries. A battery cell’s energy density gives an electric
      vehicle its driving range, so a higher energy density means that a
      car can drive more miles between charges. The UT Austin battery
      formulation also allows for a greater number of charging and
      discharging cycles, which equates to longer-lasting batteries, as
      well as a faster rate of recharge (minutes rather than hours).<br>
      <br>
      Today’s lithium-ion batteries use liquid electrolytes to transport
      the lithium ions between the anode (the negative side of the
      battery) and the cathode (the positive side of the battery). If a
      battery cell is charged too quickly, it can cause dendrites or
      “metal whiskers” to form and cross through the liquid
      electrolytes, causing a short circuit that can lead to explosions
      and fires. Instead of liquid electrolytes, the researchers rely on
      glass electrolytes that enable the use of an alkali-metal anode
      without the formation of dendrites. <br>
      <br>
      The use of an alkali-metal anode (lithium, sodium or potassium) —
      which isn’t possible with conventional batteries — increases the
      energy density of a cathode and delivers a long cycle life. In
      experiments, the researchers’ cells have demonstrated more than
      1,200 cycles with low cell resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, because the solid-glass electrolytes can operate, or
      have high conductivity, at -20 degrees Celsius, this type of
      battery in a car could perform well in subzero degree weather.
      This is the first all-solid-state battery cell that can operate
      under 60 degree Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      Braga began developing solid-glass electrolytes with colleagues
      while she was at the University of Porto in Portugal. About two
      years ago, she began collaborating with Goodenough and researcher
      Andrew J. Murchison at UT Austin. Braga said that Goodenough
      brought an understanding of the composition and properties of the
      solid-glass electrolytes that resulted in a new version of the
      electrolytes that is now patented through the UT Austin Office of
      Technology Commercialization. <br>
      <br>
      The engineers’ glass electrolytes allow them to plate and strip
      alkali metals on both the cathode and the anode side without
      dendrites, which simplifies battery cell fabrication. <br>
      <br>
      Another advantage is that the battery cells can be made from
      earth-friendly materials.<br>
      <br>
      “The glass electrolytes allow for the substitution of low-cost
      sodium for lithium. Sodium is extracted from seawater that is
      widely available,” Braga said.<br>
      <br>
      Goodenough and Braga are continuing to advance their
      battery-related research and are working on several patents. In
      the short term, they hope to work with battery makers to develop
      and test their new materials in electric vehicles and energy
      storage devices.<br>

      The advent of a Li+ or Na+ glass electrolyte with a cation
      conductivity σi &gt; 10−2 S cm−1 at 25 °C and a motional enthalpy
      ΔHm = 0.06 eV that is wet by a metallic lithium or sodium anode is
      used to develop a new strategy for an all-solid-state,
      rechargeable, metal-plating battery. During discharge, a cell
      plates the metal of an anode of high-energy Fermi level such as
      lithium or sodium onto a cathode current collector with a
      low-energy Fermi level; the voltage of the cell may be determined
      by a cathode redox center having an energy between the Fermi
      levels of the anode and that of the cathode current collector.
      This strategy is demonstrated with a solid electrolyte that not
      only is wet by the metallic anode, but also has a dielectric
      constant capable of creating a large electric-double-layer
      capacitance at the two electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The
      result is a safe, low-cost, lithium or sodium rechargeable battery
      of high energy density and long cycle life. <br>

      Inventor: GOODENOUGH JOHN, et al.<br>

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The disclosure provides a dried, water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid that is an alkali-ion conductor and an
      electronic insulator with a large dielectric constant. The
      disclosure also provides electrochemical devices and processes
      that use this material, such as batteries, including rechargeable
      batteries, fuel cells, capacitors, electrolytic generation of
      chemical products, including hydrogen gas (H2), from water, and
      electronic devices. The electrochemical devices and products use a
      combination of ionic and electronic conduction. The disclosure
      also provides a water-solvated glass/amorphous solid that is a
      proton (H&lt;+&gt;) conductor and an electronic insulator.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Ionic conductors that are also electronic insulators are
      called electrolytes; they may be a liquid or a solid. Electrolytes
      are used in a variety of electrochemical devices, including not
      only those that store electric power as chemical energy in a
      rechargeable battery or those that release chemical energy as
      electric power in a fuel cell, but also those that store electric
      power as static electric energy in an electric-double-layer
      capacitor. Electric power that is released from an electric-energy
      store, whether from a chemical or an electrostatic store, is clean
      energy. Chemical energy stored in a fuel that is released as the
      heat of combustion is a less efficient process, and combustion is
      also accompanied by the release of gases that pollute the air and
      contribute to global warming.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] An electrochemical cell contains an electrolyte between two
      electrodes, an anode and a cathode. A liquid electrolyte requires
      use of a separator of the two electrodes that is permeable by the
      liquid electrolyte; the separator prevents electronic contact
      between the two electrodes within the cell. A solid electrolyte
      may serve as both an electrolyte and a separator. In a
      rechargeable battery, the anode is a reductant; in a fuel cell,
      the anode catalyzes the separation of a reductant fuel into its
      electronic and ionic components. In both types of cells, the ionic
      component of the chemical reaction between two electrodes is
      transported to the cathode inside the cell in the electrolyte, but
      the electrolyte forces the electronic component to go to the
      cathode via an external circuit as an electronic current I at a
      voltage V to provide electric power P=IV for performance of work.
      Since the ionic conductivity in the electrolyte is much smaller
      than the electronic conductivity in a good metal, battery cells
      and fuel cells are fabricated with large-area electrodes and a
      thin electrolyte; the active electrode materials are fabricated to
      make electronic contact with a metallic current collector for fast
      transport of electrons between the active electrode particles and
      the external circuit as well as ionic contact with the electrolyte
      that transports ions between the electrodes inside the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Solid electrolytes with a large dielectric constant may
      also be used in electronic devices as separators of liquid or
      gaseous reactants as well as of solid reactants.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Liquids are generally much better ionic conductors at room
      temperature than most known solids, which is why liquids are
      normally used as the electrolyte of a room-temperature device.
      However, in some applications a solid electrolyte may be strongly
      preferred. For example, the Li-ion rechargeable battery uses a
      flammable organic liquid as the electrolyte, and a solid
      electrolyte would be safer and might be capable of improving the
      density of energy stored without sacrificing the rate of charge
      and discharge. Moreover, if the solid electrolyte also contains
      electric dipoles that give it a high dielectric constant, it can
      store much more electric energy than a liquid in an electric
      capacitance of an electric double layer of a metal/electrolyte
      interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In an electric-double-layer capacitor, metallic electrodes
      are fabricated so as to provide a maximum electrode/electrolyte
      interface. Ions in the electrolyte pin electrons or electron holes
      of opposite charge in the electrode across an electric double
      layer on charge. The separation of the electrons and holes across
      the double layer is small (atomic dimension) so the capacitance is
      large. On discharge, pinned electrons at the anode pass through
      the external circuit to recombine with the pinned electron holes
      in the cathode, and the mobile ions inside the electrolyte return
      to an equilibrium position. If the electrolyte has a large
      dielectric constant εE′r, the capacitance of the electric double
      layer is enhanced. With a solid electrolyte having a large
      dielectric constant, the enhancement of the capacitance is large,
      and it becomes possible to construct a cell where the energy
      stored has a Faradaic component as in a battery and a capacitive
      component as in an electric-double-layer capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The present disclosure inlcudes a dried, water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid electrolyte that conducts either Li&lt;+&gt;
      or Na&lt;+&gt;, or both, nearly as rapidly as a flammable organic
      liquid at room temperature and also has a large dielectric
      constant. Moreover, alkali metals can be plated and stripped
      from/to it without dendrite formation, thus avoiding safety issues
      and a limited charge/discharge cycle life. A dried, water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid that conducts Li&lt;+ &gt;may be referred to
      herein as a “Li-glass.” A dried, water-solvated glass/amorphous
      solid that conducts Na&lt;+&gt;may be referred to herein as a
      “Na-glass.”<br>

      [0009] The present disclosure inlcudes a water-solvated

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] The present disclosure relates to a water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid that conducts monovalent cations such as
      Li&lt;+&gt;, Na&lt;+&gt;, or H&lt;+&gt;, and mixtures thereof, and
      is an electronic insulator. If the water-solvated glass/amorphous
      solid conducts Li&lt;+&gt;, Na&lt;+&gt;, or mixtures thereof, it
      is dried; an H&lt;+&gt; conductor is not dried. The Li-glass and
      Na-glass are excellent conductors of Li&lt;+&gt;, Na&lt;+ &gt;or
      mixtures thereof, and have high dielectric constants because of
      the presence of electric dipoles. They also have a large enough
      electronic-state energy gap not only to be excellent electronic
      insulators, but also to allow plating of alkali-metal anodes and
      the use of high-voltage cathodes in alkali-metal rechargeable
      batteries that contain the dried water-solvated glass/amorphous
      solid as the electrolyte or separator; electrochemical capacitors
      of high electrical-storage capacity can also be made with the
      Li-glass or Na-glass as the electrolyte. They are wet by the
      alkali metal to allow plating and stripping of alkali-metal anodes
      without dendrite formation, and they are capable of high-voltage
      storage of electrostatic energy at a glass/metal interface. The
      materials can be formed as a paste for facile application to a
      large surface area. They can be used as the electrolyte and/or
      separator of a battery, fuel cell, or electrolysis cell and/or as
      a material in a capacitor of an electronic device.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The disclosure also includes a method of forming the
      water-solvated glass/amorphous solid electrolyte from constituent
      precursors containing at least one alkali metal atom, particularly
      lithium (Li) and/or sodium (Na), with oxygen and/or at least one
      halide atom, particularly chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I),
      or mixtures thereof, and water (H2O) added in an amount less than
      or equal to the solvation limit of the glass/amorphous product.
      For example, the constituent precursors of the glass/amorphous
      product may include A3-xHxOX, AX+A2O, or 2AOH+AX (H2O) with x≦1
      where A is an alkali metal such as Li and/or sodium Na or a
      mixture thereof and X a halide atom. The constituent precursor may
      also contain an oxide or hydroxide promotor of glass formation
      such as Ba(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, BaO, SrO, CaO, MgO, Al2O3, B2O3, or SiO2
      and a promoter in which sulfur replaces the oxygen. An alternative
      is to press at an appropriate temperature the precursor oxide,
      hydroxide, halide, and any other additive, including H2O, until it
      forms a glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In addition, the disclosure includes a method of drying the
      water-solvated glass/amorphous product. The method makes use of
      two chemical reactions. First, the reaction
      H2O+X&lt;−&gt;=(OH)&lt;−&gt;+HX↑, where HX evaporates as a gas,
      e.g. HCl, during heating to form the glass/amorphous product.
      Second, the reaction 2(OH)&lt;−&gt;=O&lt;2−&gt;+H2O↑ exhausts
      steam (gaseous H2O) below the decomposition temperature of the
      glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Excess alkali ions (A&lt;+&gt;) can form three types of
      dipole to give a large dielectric constant: OH&lt;−&gt;,
      OA&lt;−&gt;, and A&lt;+ &gt;in an asymmetric glass anion site.
      Orientation of the dipoles at higher temperatures, e.g.
      50&lt;T&lt;110° C., in an ac or dc electric field before cooling
      to room temperature may be used to optimize more rapidly the
      cation conductivity at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The disclosure also includes a method of fabricating the
      dried glass/amorphous product as a thin electrolyte in a cell
      where it separates two electrodes. The method includes breaking
      the glass/amorphous product into small pieces and an aprotic
      liquid, such as ethylene carbonate (EC), added to aid compaction
      of the powder into a dense film covering a current collector or an
      alkali metal anode that, on heating, reforms into a thin, dry
      glass/amorphous film with no grain boundaries.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Alternatively, the dry glass/amorphous product may be
      ground to small particles in an aprotic liquid such as ethanol to
      form a slurry or ink that can be applied as a thin layer over a
      large area of arbitrary shape; by a convenient method such as
      doctor-blading, printing, or vapor deposition. The cell ensemble
      is then sealed by a sealant such as Epoxy that cures exothermally
      and remains permeable to the evaporating gas from the liquid of
      the slurry while it is wet, but becomes impermeable as a solid
      sealant once it dries. Alternatively, the glass may be dried in a
      dry room. During evaporation of the liquid of the slurry, the
      glass/amorphous particles reform without grain boundaries into a
      continuous sheet as a Li-glass or Na-glass electrolyte having a
      large dielectric constant owing to the presence of electric
      dipoles.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The disclosure also includes a water-solvated
      glass/amorphous proton (H&lt;+&gt;) electrolyte formed by
      solvating water into a crystalline solid containing a strongly
      electropositive cation such as a large alkali ion like that of
      potassium (K&lt;+&gt;), rubidium (Rb&lt;+&gt;), or cesium
      (Cs&lt;+&gt;) and a strongly acidic polyanion such as
      (SiO4)&lt;4−&gt;, (PO4)&lt;3−&gt;, or (SO4)&lt;2−&gt;. The
      solvated water, H2O, is captured by the strongly electropositive
      cations as an (OH)&lt;− &gt;ligand with the release of the
      H&lt;+&gt; ion, which is mobile in the presence of the solid
      polyanions. This process transforms the crystalline parent
      compound into a proton electrolyte.<br>

      [0027] The disclosure includes a water-solvated glass/amorphous
      solid produced by any of these methods.<br>

      [0030] The disclosure additionally includes a method of forming a
      dielectric electrolyte by forming a paste as described above,
      applying the paste to a surface, and allowing some or all of the
      organic liquid, ionic liquid, and/or polymer to evaporate, leaving
      a reformed electrolyte dielectric. The disclosure includes the
      electrolyte-dielectric thus formed.<br>

      [0031] A water-solvated, dried glass/amorphous alkali-ion
      electrolyte having a large dielectric constant that may be used in
      an electrochemical cell that stores electric power as in a
      rechargeable battery, a cell that stores electric power as static
      electricity in the capacitances of an electric double layer at a
      metal/electrolyte interface, a cell that accomplishes both types
      of electric-power storage in the same cell, or a cell that is used

      <b>Electrolyte/Dielectric Material</b><b><br>

      [0032] The water-solvated dried glass/amorphous solid may be
      formed from a crystalline electronic insulator or its constituent
      precursors (e.g. LiCl+2Li(OH)+xBa(OH)2.8H2O) by the addition of
      water (H2O) up to the solubility limit of the crystalline
      electronic insulator. Water is solvated into the crystalline
      electronic insulator by separation of the hydroxide (OH&lt;−&gt;)
      anion from the proton. Where this separation occurs, the solvated
      water acts like a salt dissolved in a liquid. The separation of
      the hydroxide anion and the proton may be stabilized by trapping
      the proton by an X&lt;− &gt;ion with the escape of HX gas; and
      mobile OH&lt;− &gt;ions may react with one another to form H2O
      that leaves the solid at higher temperature. The separation of the
      H&lt;+&gt; and (OH)&lt;− &gt;ions may also be achieved by the
      trapping of OH&lt;−&gt; anions at a large, strongly
      electropositive atom like Ba&lt;2+&gt;, K&lt;+&gt;, Rb&lt;+&gt;,
      Ca&lt;+ &gt;with the release of the H&lt;+&gt; ion to an acidic
      matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] If a halide (X&lt;−&gt;) anion, such as a chloride
      (Cl&lt;−&gt;) anion, a bromide (Br&lt;−&gt;) anion, and/or an
      iodide (I&lt;−&gt;) anion, is also present in the crystalline
      electronic insulator, the proton can combine with the X&lt;−
      &gt;anion and depart from the solid as a hydrogen halide (HX) gas,
      with the hydroxide anion remaining in the solid. The mobile
      OH&lt;− &gt;ions may react with one another to form O&lt;2−
      &gt;and H2O with the water leaving the solid at higher
      temperatures. The departure of the proton (H&lt;+&gt;) and water
      from the water-solvated glass/amorphous solid means that the
      product is dry and can be used to contact an alkali-metal anode in
      a battery or in other electronic devices sensitive to the presence
      of water. If the hydroxide anions are not trapped in a hydrated
      polyanion such as Ba(OH)x&lt;(2-x)&gt;, they are mobile, as are
      any alkali cations, such as lithium ion (Li&lt;+&gt;) and/or
      sodium ion (Na&lt;+&gt;), of the-electronic insulator. The lithium
      ion (Li&lt;+&gt;) and/or sodium ion (Na&lt;+&gt;) are much more
      mobile than the OH&lt;− &gt;anions. Nevertheless, the mobile
      (OH)&lt;− &gt;ions may react as 2(OH)&lt;−&gt;=O&lt;2−&gt;+H2O↑
      with the escape of steam at higher temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Alternatively, if a large cation like the barium ion
      (Ba&lt;2+&gt;) or potassium ion (K&lt;+&gt;) rubidium
      (Rb&lt;+&gt;), or cesium (Cs&lt;+&gt;) is present in a crystalline
      electronic insulator, the hydroxide (OH&lt;−&gt;) anion of the
      solvated water (H2O) may be trapped in a-polyanion of the large
      cation and the proton (H&lt;+&gt;) may be mobile if the other
      anion of the crystalline electronic insulator is a strongly acidic
      polyanion like phosphate (PO4)&lt;3− &gt;or sulfate
      (SO4)&lt;2−&gt;. Most of the protons (H&lt;+&gt;) are not trapped
      by the polyanions or in a hydrogen bond so long as the solvated
      water has transformed the crystalline electronic insulator into a
      water-solvated glass/amorphous solid.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The finished water-solvated glass/amorphous solid may be
      derived from any crystalline electronic insulator or its mix of
      oxide, hydroxide, and/or halide constituent precursors that can be
      transformed into a glass/amorphous solid by the solvation of water
      into it with or without the aid of an oxide, sulfide, or hydroxide
      additive. If the original crystalline material contains a large
      concentration of alkali ions bonded to oxide and/or halide ions,
      it may be transformed into a fast conductor of lithium ion
      (Li&lt;+&gt;) and/or sodium ion (Na&lt;+&gt;) and an electronic
      insulator by drying at high temperatures. If the crystalline
      electronic insulator contains only acidic polyanions and large,
      electropositive cations that stabilize hydroxide polyanions,
      transformation to a water-solvated glass/amorphous solid by the
      solvation of water provides a fast proton (H&lt;+&gt;) conductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The water used to form a Li-glass or Na-glass may include
      less than two mole percent water and less than one mole percent of
      a glass-forming additive. The glass-forming additive may aid the
      transformation of the crystalline electronic insulator into a
      dried water-solvated glass/amorphous solid. The glass-forming
      additive may include at least one oxide, sulfide, and/or
      hydroxide, such as barium oxide (BaO), magnesium oxide (MgO),
      calcium oxide (CaO) and/or barium hydroxide Ba(OH)2, Mg(OH)2,
      Ca(OH)2, Sr(OH)2, or Al(OH)3, BaO, SrO, CaO, MgO, Al, B2O3, Al2O3,
      SiO2, S or Li2S, and mixtures thereof. The water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid has a glass transition temperature, Tg, that
      can be adjusted by the character of the cation that is introduced
      into the crystalline electronic insulator or its constituent
      precursor to promote glass formation. In addition, the hydroxide
      (OH&lt;−&gt;)&lt;−&gt; anions of the dried water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid or any other electric dipole like (OH)&lt;−
      &gt;or (OA)&lt;− &gt;where A=Li or Na, or an A&lt;+ &gt;ion in an
      asymmetric glass site may be oriented in an ac or dc electric
      field to enhance the dielectric constants and the cation
      conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The water-solvated glass/amorphous solid may be ground into
      a plurality of small pieces and mixed with a polymer, an ionic
      liquid, and/or an organic liquids such as ethanol that evaporates
      quickly or ethylene carbonate (EC) in order to form a paste for
      easy application over a large surface area before reforming into a
      glassy amorphous solid. This process may improve contact with a
      solid electrode and/or current collector. Upon evaporation of some
      or all of the liquid component, the glass/amorphous solid is
      reformed as a large-volume ionic conductor with few, if any, grain
      boundaries. Evaporation may occur prior to inclusion in an
      electrochemical device or afterwards.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Two specific processes illustrate the transformation of the
      constituent precursor of a crystalline electronic insulator into a
      water-solvated glass/amorphous solid that is an ionic conductor
      and electronic insulator that is dry.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] (1) The constituent precursor oxides, hydroxides, and
      halides of the crystalline electronic insulator may have the
      general formula A3-x&lt;+&gt;Hx&lt;+&gt;OX, wherein 0≦x≦1 and A is
      lithium (Li) and/or sodium (Na) and wherein X is chlorine (Cl),
      bromine (Br), and/or iodine (I). This starting material is rich in
      alkali ions bonded to only oxide and halide anions. Addition of
      water up to the solubility limit of the water with or without the
      addition of an oxide and/or hydroxide such as barium oxide (BaO),
      magnesium oxide (MgO), and/or barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2)
      transforms the crystalline electronic insulator or constituent
      precursor to a dry water-solvated glass/amorphous solid that is a
      lithium ion (Li&lt;+&gt;) and/or sodium ion (Na&lt;+&gt;) ionic
      conductor that remains an electronic insulator. The glass
      transition temperature decreases with an increase of the size of
      the cation of the added oxide and/or hydroxide; with the barium
      ion (Ba&lt;2+&gt;) and lithium ion (Li&lt;+&gt;), a Tg≈55° C. is
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In one example, the constituent precursors of the
      crystalline material Li3-xHxOCl contained an added 0.005 Barium
      oxide (BaO) per formula unit. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas left the
      solid during a moderate-temperature anneal of the water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid. Hydroxide (OH&lt;−&gt;) anion conductivity
      was also observed, but was much smaller than lithium ion
      (Li&lt;+&gt;) conductivity, and above 230° C., a weight loss
      signaled the occurrence of the reaction
      2(OH)&lt;−&gt;=O&lt;2−&gt;+H2O↑ as a result of the evaporation of
      the water (H2O). FIG. 1 illustrates lithium ion (Li&lt;+&gt;)
      conductivity as a function of temperature in an Arrhenius plot for
      this material. FIG. 3 presents the variation of the dielectric
      constant of this material with temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 2 illustrates sodium ion (Na&lt;+&gt;) conductivity as
      a function of temperature in an Arrhenius plot for a
      water-solvated glass/amorphous solid in which sodium (Na) replaced
      (Li) in the constituent precursor for Na3-xHxOCl to which 0.005
      Barium oxide (BaO) per formula unit was added. Hydrogen chloride
      (HCl) gas left the solid during a moderate-temperature anneal of
      the water-solvated glass/amorphous solid. Hydroxide
      (OH&lt;−&gt;)&lt;−&gt; conductivity was also observed, but was
      much smaller than the sodium ion (Na&lt;+&gt;) and above 230° C.,
      a weight loss signaled the reaction
      2(OH)&lt;−&gt;=O&lt;2−&gt;+H2O↑ which dried completely the
      glass/amorphous products.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Water-solvated glass/amorphous solid sodium-ion
      (Na&lt;+&gt;) and lithium-ion (Li&lt;+&gt;) conductors have been
      used to plate reversibly metallic sodium (Na) or metallic lithium
      (Li) onto itself without dendrites over 1000 times, thereby
      proving that a dry water-solvated glass/amorphous solid can be
      used in a rechargeable sodium-ion or lithium-ion battery and that
      similar dry materials can be used in other batteries or
      water-sensitive devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] (2) KH2PO4 is a crystalline ferroelectric in which the
      protons (H&lt;+&gt;) are trapped in hydrogen bonds. However,
      BaKPO4 is a crystalline electronic insulator containing large
      barium ions (Ba&lt;2+&gt;) and potassium ions (K&lt;+&gt;) ions
      that can stabilize hydroxide polyanions if exposed to water vapor.
      Solvation of water into this solid creates a water-solvated
      glass/amorphous solid that is a fast H&lt;+ &gt;conductor and an
      electronic insulator.<br>

      [0044] FIG. 4 presents an Arrhenius plot of the proton
      (H&lt;+&gt;) conductivity of the water-solvated glass/amorphous
      solid derived from BaKPO4 by exposure to water vapor at 80° C.
      Note that the proton conductivity is σH=10&lt;−2 &gt;S cm&lt;−1
      &gt;at a T≈75° C., which makes it possible to use it as a
      replacement for a NAFION membrane in a room-temperature fuel cell
      or a rechargeable battery with a redox-couple flow-through liquid
      electrode.<br>

      [0045] The magnitude of the ionic conductivity of an electrolyte
      in an electrochemical cell dictates the thickness and area of the
      electrolyte separating the two electrodes for a desired output
      current I. The energy difference Eg between the lowest unoccupied
      molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular
      orbital (HOMO) of the electrolyte dictates the highest voltage V
      for stable operation of a cell. Therefore, the electric power on
      charge and discharge, Pch=IchVch and Pdis=IdisVdis, depends
      critically on the electrolyte as also does the efficiency of
      storage of electrical energy, 100 Pdis/Pch%. The voltages of a
      cell are<br>
      <br>
      Vch=Vocηch(Ich) and Vdis=Voc−ηdis(Idis)  (1)<br>
      <br>
      where the voltage at open electronic circuit is Voc=(μA−μC)/e; the
      μA and μC are, respectively, electrochemical potentials of the
      anode and the cathode, and e is the magnitude of the electronic
      charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The ηch and ηdis are called, respectively, the overvoltage
      and the polarization. The η(q)=IRcell depend on the resistances
      Rcell=Rel+Rct; Rel is the resistance to the ionic conductivity
      σi=niqiμi in the electrolyte and Rct is the resistance to ionic
      transport across any electrode/electrolyte interfaces. The
      mobility μi−v/E is the velocity of the ion in an applied electric
      field E. The Rct at the anode and the cathode interface with the
      electrolyte are different from one another and the charge
      transport across an interface is also different between charge and
      discharge, so ηch≠ηdis.<br>

      [0047] The capacity of a rechargeable battery is the amount of

      of the cell 100Δtdis(n+1)/Δtdis(n) % is a measure of the cycle
      life before a rechargeable battery capacity fades to 80% of its
      original capacity.<br>

      where Q(I) is the capacity at a current I defined by equation (2).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] For a given chemical reaction between the two electrodes of
      a rechargeable electrochemical cell, a small Rel requires a thin
      electrolyte with a sufficient density ni of mobile working ions
      carrying a charge qi with a high mobility μi. The electronic
      conductivity of a highly conductive metal is orders of magnitude
      greater than any electrolyte ionic conductivity σi=niqiμi, so
      rechargeable batteries are typically fabricated with a thin
      electrolyte between electronically conducting electrodes that have
      a large area, but the electrodes need not-have a high electronic
      conductivity so long as they are not too thick and make electronic
      contact to a large-area, metallic current collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The Rct can be made small across a solid/liquid interface,
      but it is increased where a mismatch between the μA or of a solid
      electrode and the LUMO or HOMO of a liquid electrolyte requires
      formation of a passivating solid-electrolyte-interphase (SEI)
      layer that must allow transfer of the working ion across it also.
      For gaseous reactants at a solid-electrolyte surface, Rct may be
      low if it is accompanied by a high catalytic activity for the
      dissociation of the gas and its chemisorption into the electrolyte
      or the extraction of the gas from the electrolyte. A low Rct
      across a solid/solid interface is also critical. Even at an
      alkali-metal anode where plating only changes the electrode
      dimension perpendicular to the interface, a soft polymer interface
      layer that is chemically stable on contact with the two solids may
      be useful to maintain a long cycle life. If the electrode includes
      small particles into which the working ion is inserted, displaces
      an atom, or forms an alloy, the particle changes volume. This
      volume change normally prevents the solid/solid interface from
      being maintained during cycling. This problem occurs even if the
      solid electrolyte is made into a paste or a melt during
      fabrication to wet all the surfaces of the electrode particles.
      This problem limits the battery capacity and cycle life of
      previous all-solid-state batteries. However, realization of
      reversible plating of an alkali metal across the solid/solid
      alkali-metal/-glass electrolyte interface allows optimization of
      the cell voltage for a given cathode and eliminates losses
      associated with an anode SEI layer. Moreover, a solid electrolyte
      blocks soluble species of a liquid redox-molecule flow-through
      cathode or soluble intermediates of a sulfur cathode from reaching
      the anode. However, traditional solid electrolytes, whether
      glassy, amorphous, or crystalline, do not have the ionic
      conductivity needed to allow their use at ambient temperature
      unless they are so thin that they need to be supported by a porous
      substrate or sandwiched between polymer-electrolyte membranes, and
      the early report of a glass formed from a crystalline lithium
      conductor did not demonstrate why it could be dry or what ionic
      species was the dominant conductor. Moreover, it would be
      impossible to plate an alkali metal on a copper current collector
      across the solid/solid interface in the presence of liquid water
      in the electrolyte.<br>

      [0051] Since the water-solvated glass/amorphous solids obtained in
      this disclosure have a LUMO&gt;EF(Li) and are stable in organic
      liquid, ionic liquid, and/or polymer electrolytes, they may be
      used with a liquid catholyte and/or polymer located between the
      solid electrolyte and the cathode and/or with a passivating
      solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and/or polymer between
      the anode and the solid electrolyte. The dry water-solvated
      glass/amorphous electrolytes of this disclosure open up the
      possibility of using rechargeable batteries with a variety of
      cathodes: conventional reversible insertion-compound solid
      cathodes, redox flow-through liquid cathodes, gaseous air
      cathodes, and solid sulfur cathodes. The use of a solid
      lithium-ion (Li&lt;+&gt;) or sodium-ion (Na&lt;+&gt;) electrolyte
      also allows a choice of a variety of electrochemical cells,
      including fuel cells, electrolysis cells, and capacitor cells as

      [0053] Rechargeable batteries containing a water-solvated

      battery or capacitor of an electric vehicle since the temperature
      range of operation of a stationary battery can be kept small
      through all seasons at little cost. The small activation energy
      for alkali-ion transport in the electrolyte can also make feasible

      dielectric constants. The temperature dependence of the dielectric
      constants are the same as or similar to those shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Capacitors, like batteries, store electrical energy; but
      unlike a rechargeable battery or a reversible fuel cell, the
      energy is stored as the electrostatic energy between electrons or
      electron holes in the metallic plates of a capacitor and dipoles
      or mobile ions in a solid electrolyte that separates the two
      metallic plates. In a double-layer electrochemical capacitor,
      mobile cations in the electrolyte attract electrons to one plate
      and mobile and/or static anions attract electron holes to the
      opposing plate. The mobile ions of the electrolyte are trapped by
      the electrons or electron holes in the metallic plates as long as
      the charging external circuit is opened, preventing the electrons
      and electron holes created by charging from recombining. However,
      on closing the electronic circuit, the electrons recombine
      quickly, thereby releasing ion flow and dipole rotation in the
      electrolyte dielectric. FIG. 5 illustrates the charge/discharge
      cycling of a capacitor formed by sandwiching a thick
      water-solvated glass/amorphous solid between two aluminum plates.
      In the absence of carbon, the thin aluminum oxide (Al2O3) layer on
      the surface of the aluminum plates blocks charge transfer across
      the solid/solid interface to up to a 10 V charge. On discharge,
      there are three regions versus time, one within a second that was
      too fast to be recorded, one over one to three seconds that was
      slow enough to be recorded with the apparatus used, and a slow
      third that lasts for several minutes. The fastest presumably
      reflects electron transport between trapped electrons in the anode
      and electron holes in the cathodes, the intermediate discharge the
      movement of cations away from the interfaces resulting from the
      loss of trapped electron charge, and the slow discharge any
      reorientation or diffusion of the electric dipoles.<br>

      <b>Ionic Conductors</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0056] Electronic conduction controls electronic devices. However,
      nature uses ionic conduction and redox energies to accomplish many
      things. The water-solvated glass/amorphous solids of the present
      disclosure may be used in devices, methods, and systems that
      utilize both ionic and electronic conduction. For instance, the
      trapping of electrons and/or electron holes at metal/electrolyte
      interfaces may be used in an electronic memory or switch.
      Exploration of the wedding of electrochemistry and electronic
      devices remains a relatively unexplored domain.<br>
