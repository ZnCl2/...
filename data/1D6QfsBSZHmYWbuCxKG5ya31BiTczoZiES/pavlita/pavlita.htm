      <p><b>Abstract --- </b>Magnetic anomalies have been investigated
        and it is shown that the magnetization curves of para- dia- and
        ferro-magnetic materials may change temporaily due to biological
        activation. The apparatus, the method of the activation and the
        measurement procedure are briefly described and a number of test
        results are included for various materials. </p>
      <p><b>Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is generally known that biological processes involve
        electric and magnetic phenomena. In contrast to electric
        phenomena, which are well known and utilized in EKG, EEG, etc.,
        magnetic phenomena are comparatively rarely used. The reason for
        this arises from the immense technical problems involved in the
        measurement of very weak fields. Since these weak magnetic
        fields are much weaker than the magnetic field of the Earth,
        especially screened measuring rooms and very sensitive induction
        coils must be used (1). </p>
      <p>Coupled with the above, there is a time honored question in
        brain research: Is the functioning of the brain based solely on
        the complex interaction of known physical and chemical effects,
        or are there additional, hitherto unknown effects as well? On
        the basis of the results published in this study it is suggested
        that fundamentally new physical interactions are involved in the
        functioning of the brain, and perhaps in other biological
        processes as well. However, the possibility is not excluded that
        the currently recognized phenomena can be interpreted in
        another, up till now unknown, way. Research in this area may
        yield a two-fold benefit: to learn about a new, hitherto
        anomalous magnetic effect; to gain a new insight into the
        biophysics of the nervous system. </p>
      <p>Anomalous effects in the brain’s activity have been measured by
        may and Humphrey (2) and by Jahn and Dunne (3) and it is shown
        that the common roots of the anomalous effects are quite clear:
        the anomalies appear only when a target object --- the measured
        system --- is influenced by the work of an active brain. Though
        this statement seems at first sight to be an overstatement, the
        measurements o these authors and our own were repeatable and
        consistent. </p>
      <p>The cause or causes of these anomalies, and their fundamental
        features are not known at present; the cause or causes of the
        measured anomalies should most probably be sought in areas
        beyond the limits of our present knowledge. This is suggested
        for two reasons: </p>
      <p>(a) The regular biomagnetic field intensity of humans is
        approximately 10<sup>-14</sup> Tesla, which is practically
        negligible compared with the weak geomagnetic field intensity (
        ~ 7 x 10<sup>-5</sup>). </p>
      <p>(b) The measured effect cannot be induced even by a very strong
        magnetic fields nor by any present known effects. </p>
      <p>The tentative experimental findings of this work is as follows:
        The magnetization curves of certain materials change temporarily
        in an anomalous manner, most probably due to the effect of
        biological activation. This activation process requires a high
        level of mental concentration, and a small metal device. The
        paper describes briefly the activation process and the
        activation and, in a more detailed manner, the test results. </p>
      <p>The activation method and devices were developed by Robert
        Pavlita, and all samples were activated by him. The tests were
        carried out during a three-year period and the test methods were
        improved continuously. The results presented here might be of
        interest to several branches of science, including solid-state
        physics, electrodynamics, neurophysiology and psychology ---
        though some of the results remain unclassified at present. The
        interdisciplinary nature of the problem is evident but
        unfortunately this aspect complicates the solution because of
        the lack of a common language for these areas. The apparent lack
        of any communication between these branches of science may
        explain the fact that this region has not been investigated to
        any great extent. But there is another reason as well: the
        effect is barely noticeable without sensitive measuring devices,
        so the chance of accidental discovery is slim. Moreover, there
        seem to be comparatively few individuals who have the ability to
        perform activation. </p>
      <p>The aim of this study has been top investigate a natural
        phenomenon, with no immediate intention of utilizing it for any
        practical application, tog its practical use cannot be ruled out
        in the long run. </p>
      <p><b>Pavlita Activation Devices ~</b> </p>
      <p>The magnetic properties (e.g., susceptibility, saturation
        magnetization, coercivity) of most materials have been
        intensively studied for a very long time, and they can be
        considered as well-known, permanent qualities, which are
        characteristic of a given specimen. These properties depend on
        the temperature, the magnitude and direction of the external
        magnetic field, on the structure of the given material, etc.,
        and they are stable in time for chemically stable materials. </p>
      <p>Pavlita Activation Devices (PADs) may seem to offer another
        view. When a specimen of known magnetic properties is placed
        into a PAD, after a brief period (5-50 sec) its magnetic
        properties may change, and this change is not explainable by
        experimental error. </p>
      <p>There are several versions of these activation devices: they
        differ in size, shape and material, but they have common
        features as well. The larger PADs are termed "generators", the
        smaller ones "sondes", by Mr Pavlita. A few examples of devices
        are shown on the plates. The basic purpose of PADs is to amplify
        and accumulate the biomagnetic field effect. The state of art of
        investigating this effect is in its infancy, therefore the
        terminology is somewhat arbitrary, and very little is known
        about the physical roots of the effects. It is important to note
        that the effect of this biomagnetic field is qualitatively
        different from that of the usual magnetic field. (The usual term
        biofield is rather misleading but in lack of a generally
        accepted better term, we have used this one). </p>
      <p>So far as sample activation is concerned, this is a simple
        procedure: the sample has to be inserted into the hole, or one
        of the holes, or into several holes (up to 5), several times (up
        to 30) in order to increase the effect. The dimensions of the
        holes in the PAD are about the same as those of the sample. </p>
      <p>Most of our tests were carried out in the laboratory under
        controlled conditions with the measurements being carried out
        before and after the activation. These activations were carried
        out by two small sondes, these sondes being smaller in size than
        the generator. The sonde is less effective and the maximum
        change induced in the magnetic properties of the samples is
        smaller than in the case of the activation in a generator. </p>
      <p>Two activation sondes are shown in <a href="#paltes">Plates
          1-6</a>, used during the metal activation experiments. The
        sondes are made of iron with some brass parts. None of them had
        a noticeable magnetic field, and the two sondes did not attract
        or repel each other, nor did they affect non-magnetic pieces of
        steel. </p>
      <p>The sonde has to be charged or activated before its use, and
        during the activation as well. Activation is carried out in a
        generator. None of these instruments has any permanent magnet or
        electromagnet, there are no sighs of any batteries or
        electrostatic devices. We were always able to examine the
        devices at any time on request, down to the most minute details.
        The surfaces of the activation chambers were quite smooth,
        polished by regular use. These chambers did not contain any dust
        or powder, but some pollution due to wear could not be ruled
        out. </p>
      <p>The generators are steel slabs which are flat or rounded with
        activation chambers, and there are areas with rough surfaces or
        welded bronze spots. The overall dimensions were not greater
        than 20 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm. There is a hole (or sometimes two)
        with a thread in order to be able to attach the generator to the
        sonde. </p>
      <p>It is emphasized that the generator does not generate any known
        field, substance or effect. It is again mentioned that the
        terminology used in the text is somewhat arbitrary, and it may
        have nothing to do with real physical phenomena taking place
        during the process. </p>
      <p>The development of these devices seems to have been heuristic,
        and took place by trial and error. The activation itself
        requires a long period of learning, training, and it is a
        tedious procedure. The rough surface of the sonde is supposed to
        ease the activation. According to Mr Pavlita, activation is
        basically a mental process; some parts are similar to yoga
        relaxation and concentration techniques, and in principle
        anybody can learn to carry out the activation procedure. </p>
      <p>The word activation is used for that process which induces the
        measurable changes, though it has nothing to do with
        radioactivity. The word active merely notes that an anomalous
        change has occurred on a test specimen, or a PAD is capable of
        inducing the anomalies. </p>
      <p>According to Mr Pavlita, the capability for activation is
        limited in terms of size, it is not possible to activate large
        objects, only those of the order of centimeters. Furthermore,
        the size of the devices is limited because severe pain and rapid
        fatigue occur if a device larger than about 20 cm x 20 cm x 20
        cm is activated. The activation has not been attempted by other
        persons for two reasons: (a) the primary object of the test is
        to verify the existence of the phenomenon, (b) the learning
        process is long and time consuming. </p>
      <p>The activation takes place with the combined use of both hands,
        in a prescribed regular zig-zag manner, through several days or
        weeks, every day for about one hour. </p>
      <p><b>Experimental Procedure ~</b> </p>
      <p>The effect of activation was investigated utilizing a vibrating
        sample magnetometer. This type of magnetometer is commonly used
        for measuring the magnetic moment of materials, and is one of
        the most generally employed measuring apparatuses in magnetic
        research (4, 5). By means of this equipment one can
        quantitatively measure the magnetization of the samples. The
        sample to be measured is placed into an electromagnet or
        solenoid which produces a magnetic field which, in turn,
        magnetizes the sample. This induced magnetic moment of the
        sample is measured as a function of the external field. During
        the measurement of the sample is vibrated and the moving
        magnetized body induces an electric signal in the measuring coil
        system surrounding the sample. The value of the induced electric
        field is proportional to the magnetic moment of the sample. The
        position of the sample in the electromagnet is shown in Figure
        1. In this arrangement the direction of vibration is
        perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. For one
        part of the measurements another vibrating sample magnetometer
        was used in which the direction f the magnetic field was
        parallel to the direction of vibration. The external magnetic
        field is increased linearly (from zero) and the induced magnetic
        moment of the sample is detected continuously as a function of
        the field. The magnetization is plotted against the external
        field by and X-Y recorder. </p>

      </center>
      <p>In every case, we took the utmost care in endeavoring to ensure
        the most reliable and vigilant conditions for measurements. Mr
        Pavlita activated the samples, prepared by us in our own
        laboratory. The previously marked samples were given to Mr
        Pavlita by one of the authors, and during the intervals by one
        of the authors. The samples were identified by marking their
        non-activated ends. Immediately after activation one of the
        authors took the sample out of Mr Pavlita’s hand and measured it
        in the magnetometer. Only one of the authors worked with the
        magnetometer, Mr Pavlita’s measurement process, and in a
        separate room in the case of the ferromagnetic specimens. The
        equipment used for the activation was checked before, during and
        after the activation, and every part of it was carefully
        scrutinized. The samples were stored at some distance from Mr
        Pavlita and only immediately prior to the activation was a given
        sample handed over. </p>
      <p>The samples were activated in a small sonde by inserting them
        several times into the activation holes. The magnetization curve
        was recorded in the magnetometer immediately before and after
        activation. None of the experimental parameters (the exact
        position of the sample in the magnetometer, sensitivity of the
        apparatus, etc.) was changed from measurement to measurement.
        The samples were fixed to the sample holder of the magnetometer
        using a small piece of adhesive tape. The samples to be
        activated were measured before the activation together with the
        adhesive tape, and the adhesive tape was also measured without
        the sample. The sample holder itself gave no signal. After
        activation had taken place, the sample was replaced in the
        sample holder, using the same piece of adhesive tape as earlier,
        and the measurement was repeated. The activated end of the
        sample --- which had not been touched by anybody during the
        whole process --- was inserted into the sensitive region of the
        sensing coils. The non-activated end of the samples was so far
        from the sensitive region during measurements that it could not
        have caused any signal even if it was somehow magnetized. After
        the activation and before the measurements the samples was
        sampled were brought into contact with a grounded conductor
        because the possible electrical charge on the sample to be
        measured is able to cause a signal in the magnetometer that is
        similar to that from a magnetic moment. </p>
      <p>It is our firm belief that the above-described precautions
        completely ensured that the samples were not tampered with or
        substituted. We are confident that the results are not the
        consequence of the consequence of sleight of hand or measurement
        errors. </p>
      <p><b>Activation of Wood and PVC Samples ~</b> </p>
      <p>A number of wood and PVC samples were measured and it was found
        that the activation process in the above-described devices
        significantly affected the magnetic behavior of the samples. The
        samples were cylindrical in shape, with a diameter of 2.5-3.2 mm
        and a length of 27-50 mm. One of the ends was activated, the
        length of the activated part being about 5-10 mm. Some of the
        samples were measured before as well as after activation; the
        rest of the samples were not measured before activation but in
        this case we measured control (non-activated) samples having the
        same properties. On no occasion did the samples show any
        magnetic activity, i.e., they could not be magnetized measurably
        by an external field. The magnetic properties of the majority of
        the samples (20 wood and 4 PVC) were changed due t the
        activation. For 5 wood samples we did not find any measurable
        change. These 29 samples were activated far from the place of
        measurement (at Mr Pavlita’s laboratory) and we measured them
        several days or weeks after activation. We did not consider the
        results of these preliminary experiments as evidence of
        successful activation, but of these preliminary experiments as
        evidence of successful activation, but they strongly indicated
        to us that something really happens with the samples during
        activation, and the effect is worthy of careful, systematic
        investigation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;For this reason a measurement series was made, in which
        five wood and four OVC samples were activated in our laboratory,
        following the precautionary measures described in the previous
        paragraph. Every activation was successful, i.e., the samples
        became magnetic due to the activation. The result of one
        measurement is shown for illustration purposes in Figure 2. The
        figure shows the original measurement curve of sample W1, i.e.,
        magnetization M of the sample as a function of the external
        magnetic field H. The intensity of the field is given in
        kilogauss, and the magnetic moment of the sample is given in CGS
        electromagnetic units (emu). The magnetization curve of the
        sample before activation (together with adhesive tape) is shown
        in Figure 20, and the magnetization curve of the same sample
        after activation (together with the same adhesive tape) is
        plotted in Figure 2b. It is seen that the magnetization before
        activation. The magnetization curve of the adhesive tape without
        sample --- which is not shown here --- is exactly the same as
        curve (a) in Figure 2, so curve (b) can be considered as the
        background for this sample. This means, at the same time, that
        the non-activated wood samples do not show any magnetic activity
        (at least at such sensitivity of the measurement). Figure 3
        shows the net magnetization curve of the activated sample
        obtained by subtracting Figure 2a and 2b, and calculating the
        magnetization in milligauss (mG). The accuracy of this value
        cannot be very high because the size of the specimen was larger
        than the homogeneous sensitive area of the measuring coils (In
        order to calculate the magnetization in Gauss it is necessary to
        know the volume of the magnetized body). We could only estimate
        the effective volume of the measured specimen. The error is
        believed not to exceed 20%. The most important purpose of our
        work, however, was to demonstrate the change in magnetic
        properties of specimens, brought about by activation. These
        measurements are eminently suitable for comparison, the exact
        extent of susceptibility of the sample is now of secondary
        importance. </p>

        <p><img src="fig3a.jpg" height="388" width="344"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The magnetizaton curves of other samples are exactly the same
        in character as that shown in Figure 2. Table I shows the
        magnetization of the activated samples Ms. The definition of Ms
        is shown in Figure 3. Before activation, Ms is zero (within the
        limits of measurement sensitivity for every specimen). </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="tabl1a.jpg" height="80" width="321"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The magnetization curves of the activates samples are similar
        to the magnetization curves of the ordered magnetic structures,
        e.g., of ferromagnetic materials, like iron or various soft
        magnetic alloys. </p>
      <p>The only possible explanation, which is in keeping with our
        classical knowledge, could be the pollution of the surface of
        the wood samples with grains of ferromagnetic material. Our
        measurements showed that about 0.02 mg iron can cause the same
        signal as the activated samples. But the possibility of iron
        grains reaching the specimen’s surface does no seem probable
        because the holes in the sonde seemed to be clean and their
        surface to be smooth. To check this, we made measurements in
        such a way that we drilled a hole into a piece of iron, did not
        polish the hole after drilling in order to increase surface
        pollution and then inserted and rotated a wood sample into the
        hole many times, intentionally very forcefully. The
        magnetization curves were taken before and after this process,
        and it was found that the magnetization of the sample increased
        slightly, the magnetization curve showed a similar character to
        that in Figure 3, but the effect was about 1/6 of the activation
        in the sonde. That is, we obtained 8 mG for the value of Ms in
        the case of this specimen, whereas the average Ms for the
        activated wood samples was 45 mG. So the possibility of iron
        grains getting to the samples during activation and causing a
        change in the magnetic properties in such a way seems unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>The change in magnetic properties due to activation is not
        stable in time: samples lose their magnetic activity after a
        certain time. Three wood samples were activated in Mr Pavlita’s
        lab, in the presence of one author, maintaining the
        above-mentioned precautions. The samples were marked; after
        activation they were put into a box then closed and guarded by
        the authors, and the samples were measured in the magnetometer
        from time to time, Before every measurement the magnetometer was
        calibrated. The activated end of the samples was never touched.
        Figure 4 shows the change of the magnetization Ms of the samples
        as a function of the number of days after activation. It is seen
        that the magnetic activity definitely and continuously decreases
        in time. </p>

      <p><b>Activation of Dia- and Paramagnetic Samples ~</b> </p>
      <p>In addition to the wood and plastic samples, several other
        materials were tested as well. The primary reason for additional
        measurements was to learn more about the biologically induced
        magnetic anomalies, and to improve the test methods. For this
        reason, instead of wood and plastic materials, diamagnetic and
        paramagnetic materials were also used for the experiments. The
        advantage of these materials was that their physical properties,
        such as chemical composition and material structure, are known
        and controllable in contrast to the properties of wood samples.
      </p>
      <p>A series of experiments were performed using transparent, LiTaO<sub>3</sub>
        single crystals. These crystals are diamagnetic and have
        negative susceptibility, i.e., the sample magnetization and
        magnetizing field are opposite in direction, and magnetization
        depends linearly on the external field. </p>
      <p>Two cylindrical specimens were used both of 4 mm diameter and
        23 mm length. Both of them were activated and measured before
        and after activation. The activation was performed in Mr
        Pavlita’s laboratory, in the presence of one author. The samples
        were prepared and marked by us, and after activation nobody
        could have tampered with or substituted them. After activation
        the character of magnetization curves remained unchanged (i.e.,
        linear), but the absolute value of the susceptibility increased
        by 85% due to the activation for both samples. The magnetization
        curves (after eliminating the effect of adhesive tape) are shown
        in Figure 5 for both LiTaO<sub>3</sub> crystals (samples A and
        B), before (curves a) and after (curves b) activation. The
        measurement method was the same as that described earlier. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Five bismuth samples (which have a very high diamagnetic
        susceptibility) were manufactured in order to test diamagnetic
        metal specimens. For three samples the susceptibility decreased
        due to the activation. The test result of one of these samples
        is shown in Figure 6. For all the activation tests the
        magnetization curve remained linear, but the degree of change
        was different. In one case the susceptibility of the sample
        increases (its absolute value decreased), i.e., the activation
        changed the susceptibility of this sample to the opposite
        direction of that found in the other cases. The susceptibility
        of the fifth sample was not influenced by the activation. </p>
      <p>The induced change vanished gradually for all samples; three
        days after the activation all the samples had returned to their
        pre-activation level. </p>
      <p>The effect of activation was also investigated for two
        paramagnetic materials, viz., for aluminum and praseodymium.
        Aluminum has a low paramagnetic susceptibility, the measured
        samples were in the form of a coiled strip of foil so the
        measured susceptibility of these samples is very low;
        practically only the usual background can be measured. Three
        samples were activated; one of the test results is plotted in
        Figure 7. Due to activation the magnetization curves of the
        other samples changed in a similar way. Praesodymium is a rare
        earth metal with quite high paramagnetic susceptibility. The
        samples were shaped like prisms with a square cross section
        (about 3-4 mm<sup>2</sup>) and 20-30 mm length. Three samples
        were activated; all of them changed their magnetization curves
        significantly and in the same way. The result of activation for
        one of the samples is shown in Figure 8. it seems that the
        testing of the rare earth metals looks promising despite the
        technical difficulties due to their rapid oxidation. </p>

      </center>
      <p>All of the measurements described in this paragraph were made
        in such an arrangement in which the direction of the magnetizing
        field was perpendicular to the axis of samples and parallel with
        the direction of vibration. </p>
      <p><b>Activation of Ferromagnetic Materials ~</b> </p>
      <p>In another series of experiments ferromagnetic samples were
        used. The parameters of these samples were well known and due to
        their magnetically ordered structure they show strong magnetic
        activity. They have characteristic magnetization curves, from
        which different material parameters, like initial
        susceptibility, saturation magnetization, and coercive force,
        can be determined. Another advantage is that in the case of
        ferromagnetic samples the effect of the possible ferromagnetic
        pollution is out of the question because the amount of
        ferromagnetic pollution on the surface (due to the activation
        process) is small in relation to the mass of the sample, so it
        cannot cause a measurable signal change. </p>
      <p>The measurement of magnetization curves of these samples was
        performed using another vibration sample magnetometer. Here both
        the direction of the magnetizing field and the direction of
        vibration are parallel to the axis of the samples. </p>
      <p>The measurements show that the activation procedure affects the
        magnetization curves of the examined ferromagnetic materials.
        Permalloy, nickel, Fe<sub>3</sub>Al and metglass samples were
        used for the experiments. The specimens were about 20 mm long,
        1-2 mm in width, with a thickness of 20-200 um, but the Fe<sub>3</sub>Al



        was cylindrical with a diameter of 0.5 mm. </p>
      <p>Two samples of permalloy, of nickel and of Fe<sub>3</sub>Al
        were activated. The effect of activation on the magnetization
        curve can be seen in Figures 9-11. The rest of the samples, not
        shown here) changed the magnetization curve in a similar way. It
        is seen that the saturation magnetization of samples
        significantly changed due to activation, and also changed the
        slope of the initial magnetization curve. The coercivity (the
        distance between the point of intersection of the hysteresis
        curve and the H = 0 point on the H axis) also changed slightly
        for the nickel sample, while for the other two cases it was not
        influenced. </p>

      </center>
      <p><br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>It is worthy of note that the first activation attempt of Fe<sub>3</sub>Al
was




        unsuccessful during an afternoon measuring session. Next
        morning, however, the activation was successful --- when Mr
        Pavlita was not tired. </p>
      <p>It is remarkable that the value of saturation magnetization
        (i.e., magnetization value M, which is reached by the hysteresis
        curve at high field region, decreased in the case of permalloy
        and nickel, due to activation, whereas activation increased it
        in the case of Fe3Al. </p>
      <p>The magnetization curve regained its original shape after
        three-four days, as can be seen from Figure 11, where the broken
        line shows the original curve, and continuous lines show the
        curves after activation, where N represents the number of days
        after activation (N = 0 is the result of measurement immediately
        after activation). A similar process is illustrated for the
        permalloy specimen in Figure 12. <br>

      <p>The other part of the activation of ferromagnetic materials was
        made on metglass samples. Metglass ( = metal-glass) material is
        a new and intensively studies type of metal. These samples are,
        in fact, amorphous iron alloys whose structure is due to the
        very rapid quenching. </p>
      <p>Two types of metglass material were activated; the composition
        of the first material was Fe<sub>40</sub>Ni<sub>40</sub>Si<sub>6</sub>B<sub>14</sub>;
        the composition of the second one was Fe<sub>75</sub>Cr<sub>5</sub>B<sub>20</sub>.
        Five samples of the first material were activated. The
        saturation magnetization and the slope of hysteresis curve
        increased significantly in three cases due to activation is
        shown in Figure 14. It is seen that the saturation magnetization
        drastically decreased, and at low field region it shows a very
        strange character. Though the whole phenomenon is anomalous,
        these were quite unusual magnetization curves, and the same
        irregularity was fund for two specimens. All five specimens were
        of the same material and they were activated in the same sonde
        (see Plate 1 and 2) having one activation chamber only, but the
        results (which can be seem by comparing Figures 13 and 14) were
        quite different. </p>

      <p>The time dependent behavior of the magnetization curve of the
        activated specimen of Figure 14 is plotted in Figure 15. Here
        only the parts of the full hysteresis curves are shown, with
        decreasing positive fields. After four days the hysteresis curve
        regained its original shape. </p>
      <p>Two samples of the second metglass material were also
        activated. The activation procedure yielded the same result for
        both specimen, i.e., the saturation magnetization of the samples
        decreased, but not so drastically as in the previous case, as
        plotted (for one of the samples) in Figure 16. </p>

      <p><b>Conclusion ~</b> </p>
      <p>The major aim of the authors has been to carry out experiments
        on biologically induced magnetic anomalies in which physics
        itself is used to maintain the authenticity of the tests. This
        does not, of course, mean that in addition we did not try to
        ensure that no trickery involved. </p>
      <p>The experiments unambiguously showed that in the majority of
        cases the activation procedure significantly the magnetic
        properties of the samples --- so this procedure is worth
        studying. Comparing the results of different activation trials,
        the possibility that some kind of pollution causes this change
        can be excluded. Namely, activations in the same sonde (in the
        same holes of the sonde) provided different sign changes in the
        magnetization curves, which changes cannot be explained by the
        presence of the same kind of pollution on the surface of
        activated samples. </p>
      <p>The unstable character of the induced change was also observed.
        While wood retained this anomalous state for a longer period,
        other specimens returned to their original pre-activated state
        within 2-4 days. This phenomenon seems to indicate that the
        change in the sample’s behavior --- induced by activation ---
        reflects some kind of fundamental physical process. </p>
      <p>Though there are several issues to be clarified in the future,
        the presence of this magnetic anomaly seems to be associated
        with the activity of the brain. O the basis of our present
        knowledge, these anomalies cannot be induced by any known
        physical phenomenon therefore one may not rule out the statement
        that the brain activity involves a yet unknown physical
        phenomena. At the same time we have no doubt about the necessity
        of further considerations and investigations if we wish to
        exclude or strengthen the possibility of other possible
        interpretations, in spite of the fact that for the moment we
        have no idea about other explanations which are in keeping with
        our classical knowledge. </p>
      <p>The primary purpose of this work has been to examine the
        reality of this magnetic anomaly; little attention has been paid
        to the mental process as well, but there is very little hope for
        progress without the help of neurophysiologists and
        psychologists. </p>
