      <br>
      A shark repellent is any method of driving sharks away from an
      area. Shark repellents are a category of animal repellents. Shark
      repellent technologies include magnetic shark repellent,
      electropositive shark repellents, electrical repellents, and
      semiochemicals.<br>
      <br>
      Shark repellents can be used to protect sharks by driving them
      away from areas where they are likely to be killed by human
      beings; in this case, the shark repellent serves as a conservation
      method.<br>
      <br>
      There is evidence that surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate
      can act as a shark repellent at concentrations on the order of 100
      parts per million. However, this does not meet the desired "cloud"
      deterrence level of 0.1 parts per million.[1][2]<br>
      <br>
      Research indicates that sharks will avoid an area when they smell
      chemical released by dead and dying sharks. Six chemicals were
      synthesized from shark glands and tissues and used in experiments.
      Sharks immediately reacted once they detected these chemicals. To
      quote a 2004 Associated Press article, "Fisherman and scientists
      have long noted sharks stay away if they smell a dead shark."[3]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Recent Advances</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There have been significant advances in the research, development,
      and testing of aerosol shark repellents that repel sharks through
      replicating the chemicals that sharks emit when they die or are in
      danger.[4] The scientists behind these advances, Dr.Eric Stroud
      and Dr. Patrick Rice, operate a company dedicated for the research
      and development of such shark repellents.[5] Their organization,
      SharkDefense, is geared towards saving both humans and sharks.[6]
      Sharkdefense does not sell any products, but they are partnered
      with a company called SharkTec LLC, which sells Sharkdefense
      approved products at sharktecdefense.com [7]<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Some of the earliest research on shark repellents took place
      during the Second World War when military services sought to
      minimize the risk to stranded aviators and sailors in the water.
      Studies at the time, combined with historical research, revealed
      that about the only thing that will drive sharks away is the odor
      of another dead shark. Efforts were made to isolate the active
      principles in dead shark bodies that repelled other sharks.
      Eventually, it was determined that certain copper compounds, such
      as copper sulfate[citation needed] and copper acetate ,[8] in
      combination with other ingredients, could mimic a dead shark and
      drive live sharks away from human beings in the water. For years,
      a combination of copper acetate and a black dye to obscure the
      user was supplied to sailors and aviators of the United States
      Navy as a shark repellent. Known as "Shark Chaser," it was first
      packaged in cake form using a water soluble wax binder and rigged
      to life vests. The Navy employed Shark Chaser extensively between
      1943 and 1973. It is believed[8] that the composition does repel
      sharks in some situations, but not in all, with about a 70%
      effectiveness rating.<br>
      <br>
      Today, the search for an ideal shark repellent is ongoing. Some
      research, based on semiochemicals, looks promising. Electrical
      devices that disturb a shark's sensitive ampullae of Lorenzini are
      also partially effective.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Researchers tout shark repellent</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Excited by the scent of blood, a dozen
      sharks dart about in a frenzy as a researcher dips a pole in the
      sea and squirts out a clear, yellowish substance. Within seconds,
      the sharks jerk their snouts away and vanish.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers say they finally have found a potent repellent to
      drive away sharks, after testing off Bimini island in the Bahamas.
      It’s a goal that’s eluded scientists for decades.<br>
      <br>
      If proven effective, the repellent one day might protect divers,
      surfers and swimmers. But researchers say that would require much
      more study. First they hope it can protect sharks — in decline
      worldwide due to overfishing — by reducing the numbers caught
      needlessly by long-line commercial fishermen.<br>
      <br>
      “You introduce this chemical, and they all leave,” said lead
      researcher Eric Stroud, a 30-year-old chemical engineer from Oak
      Ridge, N.J. “It works very, very well.”<br>
      <br>
      The repellent, called A-2 because it was the second recipe tried,
      is derived from extracts of dead sharks that Stroud gathered at
      New Jersey fish markets and piers. Fishermen and scientists have
      long noted sharks stay away if they smell a dead shark.<br>
      <br>
      “We have something that really works, but research remains,” said
      Samuel Gruber, a University of Miami marine biologist and shark
      expert who is helping conduct tests at the Bimini Biological Field
      Station.<br>
      <br>
      Tests have found the repellent effective on three species: the
      Caribbean reef, blacknose and lemon sharks. Studies are needed on
      other species such as the great white, mako and oceanic whitetip.<br>
      <br>
      Gruber said the repellent seems to carry a chemical messenger that
      triggers a flight reaction. He said more studies are needed to
      pinpoint the active molecule among a dozen or so.<br>
      <br>
      A dose of 4 fluid ounces is enough to scare away feeding sharks,
      Stroud said, keeping them away from a fish head for two hours with
      just a few drops per minute. In contrast, sharks didn’t respond to
      a red dye in control tests.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers presented their work in May during a meeting of
      the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists in
      Norman, Okla. Films of their tests captured images of sharks
      splashing the surface as they turn to flee.<br>
      <br>
      They hope to make a slow-dissolving repellent for use in baits and
      fishing nets, and to guard equipment on submarines and oil
      exploration vessels that sharks have damaged in the past.<br>
      <br>
      The repellent, though nontoxic, is apparently so disagreeable to
      sharks it can revive them from semiconsciousness. Some species
      slip into a hypnotic state if turned belly-up, and tests found the
      repellent brought captive sharks out of that trance.<br>
      <br>
      Repellent research began in World War II, when the U.S. Navy
      created “Shark Chaser” for sailors and downed pilots. Mixed with
      black dye, it was made of copper acetate, which scientists thought
      would smell like a rotting shark. Studies later showed it wasn’t
      that effective.<br>
      <br>
      A promising find came in 1972, when University of Maryland shark
      expert Eugenie Clark discovered that a Red Sea fish, the Moses
      sole, secreted a milky substance that repelled sharks.<br>
      <br>
      The finding caused a stir, and soon the makers of Coppertone
      suntan lotion contacted Clark, hoping to market it. She said she
      discouraged them, saying initial research couldn’t back up such a
      use.<br>
      <br>
      Years of study followed by Gruber and others. In the end, though,
      the repellent derived from the sole wasn’t practical because it
      had to be squirted into a shark’s mouth to be effective.<br>
      <br>
      Clark — who at 82 still works at Mote Marine Laboratory in
      Sarasota, Fla. — said the latest findings could be a welcome way
      to reduce accidental killing of sharks, though she is skeptical of
      human use, saying few would be carrying the repellent at the rare
      moment it’s needed.<br>
      <br>
      “I’d be happy to see somebody work it out, but I don’t see it as a
      practical solution,” she said.<br>
      <br>
      Anti-shark items on the market now include cages, steel mesh suits
      and a device called the Shark Shield, which when worn by divers or
      surfers emits an electric field. The device’s Australian maker
      acknowledges it can’t guarantee total effectiveness.<br>
      <br>
      In most cases, the danger of attack is extremely slight. The
      International Shark Attack File, at the Florida Museum of Natural
      History, recorded 55 unprovoked attacks worldwide last year,
      including four deaths.<br>
      <br>
      Stroud got the idea to pursue a repellent after several 2001 shark
      attacks drew widespread attention, including one that nearly
      killed an 8-year-old boy near Pensacola, Fla.<br>
      <br>
      Stroud and engineer Mike Herrmann do lab work in a New Jersey
      warehouse, relying on donations of less than $500,000 from two
      private benefactors.<br>
      <br>
      They have a patent pending and are starting a company, Shark
      Defense Inc., to eventually market the repellent.<br>

          Repellent Sprays</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>HOW A SHARK HUNTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Sharks have an amazing sense of smell (most sharks can detect
      blood and animal odors from many miles away) which is one of the
      reasons they are such effective predators. In addition to smell,
      sharks also rely on their sense of taste. Typically before a shark
      commits to its prey it will first give a "test bite". The shark
      has very sensitive taste buds in its mouth which can quickly
      decipher whether the potential meal is within its ordinary diet;
      in the case of humans the shark will often reject this prey after
      the first bite.<br>
      <br>
      <b>GAME-CHANGING DISCOVERY: </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Using what is called Semiochemicals derived from decomposed sharks
      SharkTec is able to offer a natural product which triggers a
      flight reaction in sharks. Essentially living sharks will
      instinctually stay far-far away from the area where they can smell
      and taste another dead shark!<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROVEN, TESTED RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The theory of repelling living sharks by using semiochemicals as
      shark repellents was proposed by Baldridge (1990) and by Rasmussen
      and Schmidt in 1992. In 2001, investigation of these possibilities
      led Eric M. Stroud (SharkTec’s partner) to begin qualitative
      analysis on semiochemical extractions using captive juvenile
      sharks. In 2003, with the help of Dr. Samuel Gruber, Grant
      Johnson, and the Bimini Biological Field Station, the team was
      able to document a number of successful field tests on wild
      feeding sharks. The results of these field tests were first
      presented at the 2004 Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and
      Herpetologists 26 – 31 May, 2004, in Norman, OK. Since then the
      product has continued to return compelling results and has been
      feature on well known publications such as Discovery Channel.<br>

      proven and independently tested electronic shark deterrent
      designed to reduce the risk of an unwanted shark encounter.<br>
      <br>
      Shark Shield devices create a powerful electrical field which
      induces spasms in predatory shark's highly sensitive electrical
      receptors. Used by professional and navy divers around the world,
      the FREEDOM7 is a safety device providing peace of mind while
      supporting the conservation of shark<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Drawn by the call of the ocean, sharks or no sharks, we’re
      still going out there! Our solution is scientific, lightweight and
      powerful. With Shark Shield, we’ve replaced fear with awe.<br>
      <br>
      Shark Shield has taken 20 years of tireless scientific research to
      evolve into what it is today: proven, reliable and non-evasive
      shark deterrent technology. And underlying it all is a deep
      respect for sharks, the great predators of the ocean. Now you can
      have the peace of mind to swim, surf, kayak and dive without fear.
      It’s our playground, but it’s their home!<br>
      <br>
      In 1995 it was discovered that sharks have a heightened
      sensitivity to close-range, low frequency electrical fields. Two
      decades of intensive global research has developed this knowledge
      into a reliable and essential piece of equipment that protects
      visitors to the ocean and the predators that live there.<br>
      <br>
      Shark Shield consists of two electrodes which when both are
      submerged emit a three dimensional electronic field that surrounds
      the user. When a shark comes to within a few meters of the Shark
      Shield, the strong electronic pulses emitted by the device cause
      the shark to experience muscle spasms.<br>
      <br>
      This does NOT harm the shark in any way, but merely causes it to
      experience a high level of discomfort. From testing, the closer
      the shark is to the Shark Shield field, the more spasms occur in
      the sharks’ snouts, which results in it turning away from the
      electronic field, thereby protecting the user.<br>
      <br>
      When you’re out there surfing, you don’t want to be thinking about
      predators. Now with Shark Shield connected to your board, all you
      have to think about is your next wave! The low drag antennae in
      the water below you will emit an electrical pulse that is keeps
      you safe and does no lasting harm to the creature.<br>
      <br>
      Sharks have highly sensitive electrical receptors called Ampullae
      of Lorenzini located in their snouts. These sense electrical
      current and are used to detect prey, but only at very close
      distances. Once the shark is out of the affected area, it no
      longer feels the electrical impulse.<br>
      <br>
      There are no long-term adverse effects to the shark and as a
      result Shark Shield devices support the conservation of sharks by
      removing the need for culling or other lethal means of managing
      human and shark interactions.<br>
      <br>
      Shark Shield devices do not affect other ocean creatures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Proven Protection</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      When you strap a Shark Shield to your ankle, board or kayak, you
      are strapping on the credibility and belief of some of the worlds
      leading oceanic organizations: from the Natal Sharks Board in
      South Africa, to the Australian Elite Military and the US Coast
      Guard.<br>

      You can review published test results in our Scientific Research
      section. The video below shows Ian “Shark” Gordon testing Shark
      Shield and the effectiveness of the technology on even the largest
      of sharks.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of continuous research and investment over the past
      ten years, Shark Shield has lodged numerous patents relating to
      electrical shark deterrents.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Scientific Overview</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Shark Deterrent Research by Kwazulu Natal Shark Board<br>
      <br>
      The electrical wave-form used in the Shark Shield is based on a
      technology originally invented by the Kwazulu Natal Shark Board of
      South Africa in the 1990's.<br>
      <br>
      Predatory sharks have small gel filled sacs knows as ‘Ampullae of
      Lorenzini’ on their snouts. They use these short range sensors
      when feeding or searching for food.<br>
      <br>
      Shark Shield is a three-dimensional electrical wave form which
      creates an unpleasant sensation impacting the shark’s ‘Ampullae of
      Lorenzini’. When the shark comes into proximity of the electrical
      wave form (a few meters in diameter) it experiences non-damaging
      but uncontrollable muscular spasms causing it to flee the area.<br>
      <br>
      The field is projected from the unit by two electrodes, which
      create an elliptical field that surrounds the user. Both
      electrodes must be immersed in the water for the field to be
      created. The electrode configuration depends on the model of the
      Shark Shield unit and the diagram below is a mathematical example
      of how the original POD and SCUBA7 electric field would look if
      you could see it.<br>
      <br>
      In the video below we discuss how the electrical shark deterrent
      technology works and provide examples of the electircal field
      required to offer a level of protection against a shark attack. <br>
      <br>
      From testing, the closer the shark is to the Shark Shield field,
      the more spasms occur in the sharks’ snouts. This becomes
      intolerable and the shark then veers away, and usually doesn’t
      return.<br>
      <br>
      A distinct advantage of the unique electrical wave-form is that it
      deters sharks and does no lasting harm to the shark. Once the
      shark is out of the affected area, it no longer feels the effect
      of the electrical wave form. The video below shows Ian "Shark"
      Gordon testing Shark Shield and the effectiveness of the
      technology on even the larges of sharks.<br>
      <br>
      The original technology was released onto the market in 1995 by
      POD Holdings Ltd, a joint venture company partly owned by the
      Natal Sharks Board and the South African Government. In addition
      to being tested by National Military and other authorities, Shark
      Shield has been extensively tested to the highest standards by
      scientists and marine biologists over many years.<br>

      Apparatus for repelling aquatic creatures such as sharks
      comprising a pair of electrodes (18) for immersion in a body of
      water, charge storage means such as a capacitor (14) charged to a
      predetermined voltage by a charging circuit from a source of
      electrical power, such as a battery, control logic to generate
      control signals and controllable switch elements (16), such as
      silicon controlled rectifiers (SCR's), thyristors or the like that
      have a low on resistance. The thyristors (16) connect the
      capacitor (14) selectively to the electrodes (18) in response to
      the control signals, to discharge the capacitor charge into the
      water, thereby to create an electrical field between the
      electrodes (18). The charging circuit may be a DC to DC converter
      (12) that provides an output voltage higher than the battery
      voltage. The thyristors and associated circuitry are set to
      discharge the capacitor charge into the body of water in a series
      of pulses.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a method of and apparatus for repelling
      aquatic creatures such as sharks.<br>
      <br>
      The large nerves in animals such as sharks, contain many thousands
      of nerve fibres. Some of these fibres are connected to muscles
      and, when stimulated, cause the muscles to contract. Others run
      between sense organs and the animal's brain. Artificial
      stimulation of one of these large nerves by electric pulses
      applied to the nerve gives rise to the transmission of nerve
      impulses to the muscles and directly to the brain. The impulses to
      the muscles give rise to muscular twitching which, together with
      the direct impulses to the brain, are appreciated as an unnatural
      sensation apparently arising simultaneously from all the sense
      organs of the animal. These sensory messages to the brain will, in
      all probability, startle the animal and drive it away from the
      source of artificial stimulation.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant's co-pending European Patent Application
      (publication number 0 631 721) is directed to methods of and
      apparatus for controlling aquatic animals utilising such
      artificial stimulation. The patent application describes the use
      of a pulsed electric field that is set up between electrodes
      immersed in the water, the pulses having a duration of between 0.1
      and 200 ms at a repetition rate of between 1 and 60Hz. The pulses
      have an amplitude of between 24 and 72V and the rise time of each
      pulse is preferably less than 0,001us. The polarity of the pulses
      is reversed periodically by switching the output of the power
      supply to the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      When it is intended specifically to control aquatic animals of the
      sub-group Elasmobranchii, such as sharks the pulses are preferably
      generated in pulse trains, each comprising a plurality of pulses
      with a pulse duration of between 0.1 and 3ms. The pulses in each
      pulse are spaced at intervals of between 1 and 30ms and the pulse
      trains are repeated at intervals of between 100 and 1000ms. In a
      preferred version of this embodiment of the invention described in
      European Patent Application 0 631 721, each pulse in the pulse
      train has a duration of 2ms and the pulses in each pulse train are
      spaced at intervals of 20ms, the pulse trains being repeated at a
      frequency of between 2 and 5Hz. The polarity of successive pulse
      trains is preferably alternated.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a development on devices of the kind
      described in European Patent Application 0 631 721.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to this invention a method of controlling aquatic
      animals in a body of water comprises the steps of: immersing at
      least one first and one second electrode in the body of water;
      storing electrical charge in charge storage means; and discharging
      the charge storage means into the body of water via the
      electrodes, thereby to create an electrical field between the
      electrodes to repel aquatic animals from the vicinity of the
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      The charge storage means may be a capacitor which is charged to a
      predetermined voltage by a charging circuit.<br>
      <br>
      The charge storage means is preferably discharged by connecting it
      to the immersed electrodes via controlled switching elements
      having a low on resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Further according to the invention apparatus for controlling
      aquatic animals in a body of water comprises: at least one first
      and one second electrode for immersion in a body of water; charge
      storage means for storing electrical charge; a charging circuit
      for charging the charge storage means from a source of electrical
      energy; control means for generating control signals; and at least
      one controllable switch element having a low on resistance and
      arranged to connect the charge storage means selectively to the
      first and second electrodes in response to the control signals, to
      discharge the charge storage means into the body of water, thereby
      to create an electrical field between the electrodes to repel
      aquatic animals from the vicinity of the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      The charge storage means may comprise a capacitor.<br>
      <br>
      The charging circuit may be a DC to DC converter operable from a
      battery, the DC to DC converter providing an output voltage
      substantially higher than the battery voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The control means may include timing means for generating the
      control signals at a predetermined rate and driver means for
      applying the control signals to control terminals of the switch
      elements with sufficient energy to operate the switch elements.<br>
      <br>
      The switch elements are preferably silicon controlled rectifiers
      (SCR's), thyistors or the like that are selected for desirably low
      on resistance characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      The characteristics of the switch elements and associated
      circuitry are preferably selected for the charge storage means to
      discharge into the body of water in a series of pulses, each pulse
      having a rise time as close to instantaneous as is possible.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The circuits illustrated in the drawings are intended for use in a
      personal protection device that is to be worn or carried by the
      user. Such a device will of necessity be relatively small and
      light and it will, in most applications, rely on battery power.
      This is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to
      battery powered devices.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Figure 1, electrical power (either battery or mains
      power) is applied at 10 to a power converter 12.<br>
      <br>
      The circuitry of Figure 1 illustrates battery power applied to a
      DC to DC converter 12. While the voltage will be determined by the
      eventual application, a typical input voltage for a personal
      protection device is 12V battery voltage input to the DC to DC
      convertor 12 where it is converted to 60V to 200V DC. In a
      preferred form of the invention, the output voltage is 84V, but
      environmental factors, such as water temperature and salinity
      might determine that a different (or variable) output voltage be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      The DC voltage is applied to a capacitor 14 where it is stored
      pending discharge to a number of silicon controlled rectifiers
      (SCRs) 16 connected in a cross fired bridge configuration.<br>
      <br>
      Under the control of the control circuitry illustrated in<br>
      Figure 2, the SCRs 16 switch power to a set of electrodes 18. In
      use the electrodes 18 are immersed in water which serves as an
      electrolyte or load.<br>
      <br>
      The output voltage can be controlled in dependence on the
      conduction characteristics of the water surrounding the
      electrodes. For instance, the applicant has found that reducing
      water temperature reduces the water conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      A temperature sensor may therefore be used to control the
      resistance of a variable resistor in circuit with the DC to DC
      convertor 12 to vary the output voltage in dependence on the water
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The control circuitry illustrated in Figure 2 consists,
      essentially, of a timer circuit 20, a control logic circuit 30 and
      a driver circuit 40.<br>
      <br>
      The timer circuit includes an integrated circuit timer 22 which
      supplies regularly timed clock pulses to the control logic
      circuitry 30.<br>
      <br>
      The control logic circuitry 30 generates control signals which are
      applied to the driver circuit 40.<br>
      <br>
      The control logic circuitry 30 is set to apply alternating firing
      signals to the gates 42 of a pair of metal-oxide semiconductor
      field effect transistors (MOSFETs) 44 which drain to a pair of
      dual secondary pulse transformers 46.<br>
      <br>
      The output pulses from the pulse transformers are applied to the
      SCR gates.<br>
      <br>
      The control logic circuitry 30 is set to output alternating pulses
      to the MOSFET gates 42 thereby activating the MOSFETs 44 to apply
      pulses sequentially to each of the pulse transformers 46.1 and
      46.2.<br>
      <br>
      The first secondary 48.1 of the pulse transformer 46.2 is
      connected to SCR 1 (16.1). The second secondary 48.4 of the pulse
      transformer 46.2 is connected to SCR 4 (16.4).<br>
      <br>
      In the same way, the first secondary 48.2 of the pulse transformer
      46.1 is connected to SCR 2 (16.2) and the second secondary 48.3 is
      connected to SCR 3 (16.3).<br>
      <br>
      The pulse transformers have a turns ratio which is calculated to
      provide control signals to the gates of the<br>
      SCR's 16 having a sufficiently high voltage and sufficient energy
      to switch the SCR's hard on rapidly. In the preferred form of the
      invention, the SCR gates are supplied with a switching pulse that
      is in excess of the maximum SCR rated gate pulse.<br>
      <br>
      The SCR's are switched hard on rapidly in order to permit the
      fastest possible discharge of the capacitor 14 in order to obtain
      an output pulse at the electrodes with a desirably short rise time
      as is illustrated in the waveform diagrams of figures 3 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      The pulses may have a duration of between 100us and 200ms at a
      repetition rate of between 0.5 and 60Hz. In this regard, a single
      repetition of an alternating or commutated pulse device is an "up"
      and a down pulse.<br>
      <br>
      The pulse duration and shape (see figures 3 and 4) is determined
      largely by the impedance of the load (sea water). The rise time of
      each pulse is ideally as close to instantaneous as the circuit
      will permit and preferably less than 0,2us.<br>
      <br>
      The control logic circuit 30 applies control pulses alternately to
      the gates of the MOSFET's 44.1 and 44.2, so that the secondary
      windings of the pulse transformers 46.1 and 46.2 produce output
      pulses alternately.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, a control pulse applied to the gate of the MOSFET 44.2
      causes relatively high voltage control pulses to be applied to the
      gates of the SCR 1 (16.1) and SCR 4 (16.4), causing an output
      pulse of nominal positive polarity to be generated between the
      electrodes 18.1 and 18.2. The next control signal, applied to the
      gate of the MOSFET 44.1, causes control pulses to be applied to
      the gates of<br>
      SCR 2 (16.2) and SCR 3 (16.3), causing an output pulse of nominal
      negative polarity to be generated between the electrodes. Thus,
      alternate pulses at the electrodes 18.1 and 18.2 have opposite
      polarity, effectively doubling the peak to peak output voltage of
      the unit.<br>
      <br>
      Where peak output voltage is of secondary importance, a simpler
      circuit employing a single switch element can be used instead.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>New Shark Repellent Uses Chemical Signals</b><br>
        <b>&nbsp;</b><br>
        <b>Brian Handwerk</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Researchers say they have developed a shark repellent that uses
      apparently natural chemical signals to shift the animals from
      hunting mode to flight mode. If it proves to be effective and
      environmentally safe to use, it could soon become standard-issue
      for everyone who comes into contact with the marine predators—from
      surfers to commercial fishers.<br>
      <br>
      Eric Stroud is a chemist and cofounder of the New Jersey based Oak
      Ridge Shark Lab. He began looking for an effective repellent
      during 2001, when some well-publicized incidents caused a media
      feeding frenzy known as the Summer of the Shark (in fact, that
      season recorded below-average statistics of shark-human
      encounters).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "As a chemist I was wondering what was being done as far as a
      repellent," Stroud recalled. "I began looking through a lot of
      past research and ended up in the area of semiochemicals. That
      seemed to be promising."<br>
      <br>
      Semiochemicals are chemical "messengers" used in natural behavior
      and communication between individuals — though the chemicals'
      exact roles are not completely understood.<br>
      <br>
      Animals or even plants may emit different semiochemicals
      (including pheromones) which serve as sexual attractants,
      repellents to potential predators, or inducements to flight mode.
      A flower, for example, may mimic sexual attractants to draw
      pollinating insects, while other animals may emit scents that
      deter predators.<br>
      <br>
      Semiochemicals are currently used in animal-control industries
      like insect management. They can be used as attractants to lure
      bugs into traps or as repellents to keep them away.<br>
      <br>
      Semiochemicals are also common in the lives of aquatic animals,
      said Samuel H. Gruber. "Doc" Gruber is a marine biologist at
      Florida's University of Miami and a leading shark researcher with
      decades of hands-on experiences. "Certain kinds of fishes, like
      minnows, release something when attacked that tells the rest of
      the school to disperse quickly," he said.<br>
      <br>
      Stroud and assistant Mike Herrmann believed that sharks might
      possess a similar avoidance chemical that sometimes warns other
      sharks to stay away. Their task was to isolate that chemical." We
      took that as our direction and began to investigate the molecular
      chemistry of shark tissues," Stroud said.<br>
      <br>
      The hands-on results from tests at Gruber's Bimini Biological
      Field Station in the Bahamas, and elsewhere, have been very
      promising.<br>
      <br>
      To date, six different species have been effectively repelled by
      the mixture, which was dropped from a boat into a chum-filled sea
      of feeding sharks.<br>
      <br>
      "They stop feeding, go into alarm mode, and they rapidly leave,"
      Stroud explained. "Once they detect this, we suspect by olfactory
      senses, there's definitely a behavioral change, and they either go
      deep or leave the area. <br>
      <br>
      "I think it's not a question of [affecting the] gills or of pain,
      it seems to be a signal," Gruber said. "When the shark gets the
      signal its behavior looks reflexive."<br>
      <br>
      In all tests so far, the chemical has proven nontoxic to sharks.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Fish feeding in the area appear to be totally unaffected, yet
      sharks detect the substance in even minute proportions.<br>
      <br>
      In the controlled environment of lab tanks, sharks have responded
      to even 0.1 part per million — for example, they would likely
      respond to 12 ounces of the chemical in an Olympic-size swimming
      pool.<br>
      <br>
      The semiochemical is even strong enough to awaken lab sharks from
      tonic immobility, an induced, "death-feigning" state during which
      researchers can go so far as to perform surgery without arousing
      the animal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Historic Challenge</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Shark repellents have been in development for decades — with only
      limited success. Researchers have tried (and continue to try)
      everything from chemicals and cages to audio signals and electric
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      During World War II widespread ocean combat and casualties led to
      large numbers of human-shark interactions. The Navy issued a
      chemical repellent called Shark Chaser to protect sailors and
      airplane pilots.<br>
      <br>
      Sharks also caused operational difficulties. Future chef Julia
      Child helped the wartime Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the
      forerunner to today's CIA, cook up repellents that would prevent
      sharks from prematurely detonating anti-submarine explosives.<br>
      <br>
      None of these wartime repellents was particularly effective.<br>
      <br>
      In the mid-1970s, marine biologist Eugenie Clark tested a natural
      repellent from acidic protein secretions of the flounder-like Red
      Sea Moses sole. Gruber also worked on the project in Israel,
      Egypt, and Japan. However, effective, natural supplies of the
      secretion were limited and synthetic versions proved expensive and
      unstable.<br>
      <br>
      In the early 1980s Cold War developments renewed the Navy's lapsed
      interest in repellents.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to light that the submarine fleet was being challenged by
      sharks," Gruber recalled. "We had subs, as did the Soviets,
      cruising around the Atlantic listening for each other with towed
      sonar arrays, and from time to time they experienced what was
      called the 'million dollar bite.'<br>
      <br>
      The costly chomp occurred when sharks bit, and damaged, trailing
      arrays or listening devices known as hydrophones — in these cases,
      big rubber tubes about 2 inches (5 centimeters) in diameter and
      half a mile (800 meters) long.<br>
      <br>
      "The sharks were really biting into these things," Gruber
      recalled, noting that the problem spurred his first involvement in
      the development of chemical repellents.<br>
      <br>
      In the 1990s the Natal Sharks Board of South Africa developed and
      patented electronic repellent technology employed by professional
      divers on their cages.<br>
      <br>
      Australian-based SeaChange Technology currently markets the
      technology on their Shark Shield line of electronic repellent
      products for divers, swimmers, and surfers. While some hail the
      devices as effective, they lack the possible range of uses a
      semiochemical repellent could offer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fisherman's Friend?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Semiochemical repellent could find its way into everything from
      clothing to fishing tackle.<br>
      <br>
      The substance could be a boon for longline commercial fishing
      operations like swordfish boats—and for the sharks that they
      inadvertently catch.<br>
      <br>
      "To make longline fishing a little more selective, to reduce the
      horrific bycatch, which is sometimes three or five wasted sharks
      for each targeted species—that would be fantastic," Gruber said.<br>
      <br>
      Though the product must be tested on more species, recreational
      applications may soon include incorporating the chemical into
      bathing suits, sunblock, and wet suits.<br>
      <br>
      While the chance of attack will always be very small, those who
      spend time in the water may breathe a bit easier knowing that they
      are chemically less appealing to sharks.<br>
      <br>
      Yet the biggest beneficiary may turn out to be the sharks
      themselves. Helping them avoid human encounters may be critically
      important to their survival. <br>

      </b>Devices and methods are disclosed for repelling elasmobranchs
      with high-pull-force magnets, including devices and methods for
      reducing by-catch in commercial fisheries and protecting humans
      from attacks by elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Elasmobranchs represent a significant problem in the
      commercial fishing industry. Elasmobranchs are often inadvertently
      caught on fishing hooks and tackle directed at other more
      commercially valuable kinds of fish. This inadvertent catching of
      elasmobranchs (or other non-valued fish) is called "by-catch." As
      many as 100 million elasmobranchs are killed each year as
      by-catch. This loss of life has resulted in a real threat to
      several shark species. Currently, as many as 80 species of shark
      are considered threatened with extinction.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Further, when elasmobranchs are caught as by-catch, fishing
      operations receive no return on their investment since the shark
      is caught on a hook that might have otherwise brought in a
      marketable fish. Additionally, the fishing tackle on which a shark
      is caught often must be cut loose for the safety of those working
      on the fishing vessel causing a loss of both equipment and time.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Longlining is a commercial fishing method that suffers
      significant losses from shark by-catch. Longlining uses multiple
      baited individual fish hooks with leaders strung at intervals
      along an often very long (2-3 miles) main fishing line. Longline
      fishing operations routinely target swordfish and tuna. The
      longline hooks, however, are not selective and elasmobranchs are
      sometimes caught in greater numbers than the intended catch. The
      result is great loss of life in elasmobranchs and significant
      financial losses in the longline industry. Elasmobranchs cause
      additional losses in the longline fishing industry by scavenging
      marketable fish caught on longlines before the fish may be
      retrieved for processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Elasmobranchs also represent a problem in the commercial
      trawling industry. Trawling is a commercial fishing method that
      catches fish in nets. Elasmobranchs cause significant losses for
      trawlers because they scavenge fish caught in trawl nets before
      they are retrieved for processing. As such, valuable fish are
      often lost to shark predation. Also, sharks often tear holes in
      the nets, resulting in partial or complete loss of catch and
      significant repair costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] There has been a long-felt need for methods and devices to
      deter elasmobranchs from commercial fishing lines and nets.
      Attempts in the middle of the twentieth century were made to
      protect trawl nets with electric discharge devices. (Nelson,
      "Shark Attack and Repellency Research: An Overview," Shark
      Repellents from the Sea ed. Bernhard Zahuranec (1983) at p. 20).
      Nevertheless, no commercially effective repellent has yet to be
      made available for reducing shark by-catch in the commercial
      fishing industry or for reducing loss of valuable fish or fishing
      tackle to shark predation. Further, Applicant is unaware of any
      consideration in the art of the use of magnets to repel
      elasmobranchs to limit by-catch and other losses from
      elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 4,667,431 discloses an electric prod for
      repelling fish. Within the electric prod, the switch for providing
      electric current to the prod is a reed switch, which contains a
      magnet. However, the magnet is not a part of the repelling portion
      of the electric prod.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] An effective shark repellent would not only be valuable to
      the fishing industry but also would be valuable for protecting
      humans from shark attacks. No effective repellent has yet to be
      marketed for limiting the risk of shark attacks faced by humans
      exposed to elasmobranchs. Over the last 50 years antishark
      measures employed to protect humans from shark have included
      electrical repellent devices (Gilbert &amp; Springer 1963, Gilbert
      &amp; Gilbert 1973), acoustical playbacks (Myrberg et al. 1978,
      Klimley &amp; Myrberg 1979), visual devices (Doak 1974) and
      chemical repellents (Tuve 1963, Clark 1974, Gruber &amp; Zlotkin
      1982). None of these procedures proved satisfactory in preventing
      shark attacks. (Sisneros (2001)). As such, the long felt need for
      an effective repellent has not been satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Researchers have historically used several bio-assays to
      determine if a repellent evokes a flight response in shark. One
      such bio-assay measures the effect of a repellent on a shark that
      is immobilized in "tonic immobility." Tonic immobility is a state
      of paralysis that typically occurs when a shark is subject to
      inversion of its body along the longitudinal axis. This state is
      called "tonic," and the shark can remain in this state for up to
      15 minutes thereby allowing researchers to observe effects of
      repellents. After behavioral controls are established, an object
      or substance that has a repelling effect will awaken a shark from
      a tonic state. Researches can quantify the strength of a repellent
      effect from these studies.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Another bio-assay employs a Y-shaped maze wherein a shark
      is exposed to a choice between two paths containing the same
      olfactory stimulus. One path exits the maze without a repellent
      while the other contains a repellent. If the sharks consistently
      choose the path without the repellent or consistently become
      agitated in the path having the repellent, researchers may
      conclude the repellent is effective.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0030] "By-catch" is any kind of fish that is caught in a fishing
      operation wherein the fish is not the object of the fishing
      operation. For example, if the target fish of a longline fishing
      operation is tuna, an elasmobranch caught on a hook of the
      longline is by-catch.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] "Elasmobranchs" in this specification means one or more
      elasmobranchii in the super-orders Galeomorphii and Squalomorphii
      and orders Squaliforms (dogfish), Carcharhiniformes (requiem
      sharks), Lamniformes (mackerel sharks), and certain
      Orectolobiformes (carpet sharks). Elasmobranchs in this
      specification includes nurse sharks, an Orectolobiforme, but this
      specification does not include the other carpet sharks, such as
      wobbegongs.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] "Gauss" is a measure of magnetic field strength. Gauss is a
      unit of the density of a magnet's flux (or flux density) measured
      in centimeter-gram-second. A tesla is equal to 10,000 gauss. Gauss
      and tesla are common units for referring to the power of a magnet
      to attract (or repel) other magnets or magnetic materials. The
      Gauss unit describes both the coercivity of a magnet and its
      saturation magnetization. Gauss describes how strong the magnetic
      fields are extending from the magnet and how strong of a magnetic
      field it would take to de-magnetize the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] "Grade" of a neodymium-iron-boride magnet specifies the
      quality of material used to construct the magnet. All else being
      equal, the higher the quality of materials used to construct the
      magnet, the greater the magnet's strength. In grading
      neodymium-iron-boride magnets, a lower grade, e.g., N35, does not
      have as much magnetic strength as a higher grade, e.g. N45.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] "Longline" refers to a fishing line that may extend up to
      many miles wherein a mainline extends the full length of the
      longline and individual shorter gangion lines attached to the
      mainline are spaced at set intervals (perhaps several feet or
      meters or perhaps 1000 feet or greater apart). Hooks are attached
      to the individual gangion lines. Hooks may be baited and used to
      catch target fish. The addition of a magnet of sufficient strength
      repels elasmobranchs from the baited hooks as well as from the
      region of the longline generally.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] "Nominal strength" of a magnet is measured in gauss or
      tesla and reflects the theoretical strength of a magnet at its
      core. Nominal strength is a function of the grade of a magnet. The
      higher the grade, the higher the nominal strength. Nominal
      strength is the strength necessary to demagnetize the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] "Pull force" is the attractiveness of a magnet to a mild
      steel flat surface in pounds. The formula for calculating pull
      force is provided in detail herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] "Target fish" is any kind of fish, the catching of which is
      the object of a fishing operation. For example, the target fish of
      a longline fishing operation may be tuna. A fish that is caught on
      the longline that is not tuna would not be a target fish.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] "Tonic immobility" is the state of paralysis that typically
      occurs when an elasmobranch is subject to inversion of its body
      along the longitudinal axis of the body, i.e., is belly up. An
      elasmobranch can remain in this state for up to 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. HIGH-PULL-FORCE MAGNETS AS REPELLENTS OF ELASMOBRANCHS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0039] It has been discovered that high-pull-force magnets repel
      elasmobranchs. High-pull-force magnets comprising a pull force of
      about 50 pounds or greater introduced into the environment of an
      elasmobranch have demonstrated repelling action on elasmobranchs.
      Likewise, magnets comprising a nominal strength of greater than
      about 0.5 teslas (5000 gauss) have demonstrated repelling action
      on elasmobranch. Further, magnets producing about 5,000 mG to
      about 500,000 mG of magnetic strength at a distance of about 0.01
      m to about 1 m from the magnet or about 10,000 mG to about 320,000
      mG of magnetic strength at a distance of about 0.1 m to about 0.4
      m from the magnet have demonstrated repelling action on
      elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] High-pull-force magnets may be employed near fishing lines,
      fish hooks or fishing nets to repel sharks from bait, hooks or
      nets that have been set for target fish (not sharks).
      High-pull-force magnets may also be employed near people, animals
      or objects in the water to repel elasmobranchs from frightening or
      injuring the people, animals or objects in a particular area.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Sufficient magnetic force to repel elasmobranchs may be
      measured in a number of ways. Magnetic force may be measured as
      pull force, as nominal magnetic strength at the core of the magnet
      (in gauss) or at a distance of interest from the magnet (in
      gauss). Any measurement known to an artisan practicing the
      invention may be useful.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The high-pull-force magnet may be a permanent magnet or an
      electromagnet. Magnets made of neodymium-iron-boride (NdFeB) are
      preferred, given present magnet technology, since these magnets
      have high pull force relative to their physical size. A coating,
      such as nickel, may protect permanent high-pull-force magnets from
      corrosion in water. A preferred NdFeB magnet, in accordance with
      the present invention, may have a grade of about N38 through about
      N50 or greater.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A high-pull-force magnet for repelling elasmobranchs may
      comprise the shape of a cylinder, a cone, a circle, a cube, a
      disk, a bar, a sphere, a plate, a rod, a ring, a tube, a stick, a
      block, a tapered cone, or any other shape. The high-pull-force
      magnet may further comprise a hollow portion for stringing, like
      beads, on a fishing hook, line, belt, bracelet or rings. A
      high-pull-force magnet comprising a cylinder with a diameter of
      about 4 inches to about 8 inches and a thickness of about 1 inch
      to about 4 inches is preferred. A magnet with a diameter of about
      4 inches and a thickness of about 1.5 inches is most preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] High-pull-force magnets having a pull force of about 50
      pounds or greater have demonstrated repelling activity on
      elasmobranch species at distances as great or greater than 0.3 m
      from the elasmobranches. Further, a longline fitted with a series
      of seven magnets set more than 100 feet apart has shown repelling
      activity across an entire longline of about 2000 feet. As such,
      high-pull-force magnets in accordance with the invention may be
      used to repel elasmobranches. The repelling activity of
      high-pull-force magnets may be useful in the commercial fishing
      industry to reduce elasmobranch by-catch and predation, and useful
      to repel elasmobranchs from humans in the environment of an
      elasmobranch or repel elasmobranchs from an area of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The mode of action of high-pull-force magnets on
      elasmobranchs is not fully understood. While not wishing to be
      bound by any particular theory, one plausible theoretical
      explanation for this surprising finding of repellent activity of
      high-pull-force magnets is the possibility that electrical eddy
      currents are generated by an elasmobranch moving through the
      strong magnetic field created by the high-pull-force magnet. The
      resulting eddy currents may over stimulate ampullae of Lorenzini
      (known to be used by elasmobranchs for navigation and orientation)
      causing the ampullae of Lorenzini to disorient the elasmobranch or
      otherwise signal danger to the elasmobranch causing aversive
      behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Several species of sharks have demonstrated the ability to
      sense magnetic fields (Kalmijn, 1978; Ryan, 1980; Klimley, 1993;
      2002) but were not repelled by the use of such magnets. The
      ampullae of Lorenzini organ within sharks is used to detect weak
      electrical fields at short ranges, which functions in the final
      stages of prey capture: usually when a shark is inches from its
      prey. A shark's prey emits weak electric fields that are
      detectable to the shark. As a shark approaches prey, the shark can
      sense the weak electric field emitted therefrom. In the natural
      environment, the detection range of the shark's ampullae of
      Lorenzini is effective only within inches of an object. As
      magnetic field strength is increased elasmobranchs sense the
      magnetic field at much greater distances, such as 0.3 m or
      greater. When a plurality of magnets are introduced across a large
      area or region (such as along a fishing longline) sharks may sense
      a powerful magnetic field at close range spanning an area/length
      of 1000 feet.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Magnetic fields generated by high-pull-force magnets such
      as permanent magnets are effective repellents for elasmobranchs,
      excluding certain carpet sharks in the Orectolobidae family. It is
      believed that high-pull-force magnets are not effective repellents
      against certain carpet sharks, particularly spotted wobbegongs
      (Orectolobus maculatus), because they ambush predators and rely
      more on visual, olfaction, and lateral line clues than this
      magnetic sense. This species of shark is found chiefly in
      Australia and Indonesia, and does not represent significant
      by-catch species or species that are known to be aggressive
      against humans. Magnets, however, are effective against nurse
      sharks in the Orectolobiform family.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] While not wishing to be bound by a particular theory, the
      flux of a permanent magnet, such as an NdFeB magnet, may correlate
      with the detection range of the ampullae of Lorenzini. Since, the
      magnetic flux from a magnet decreases at the inverse cube of the
      distance from the magnet, at only a few meters distance the
      magnetic field exerted by the magnet is less than the Earth's
      magnetic field. As such, repelling of elasmobranchs with magnets
      appears to occur within several meters of a high-pull-force
      magnet. Additionally, if a series of high-pull-force magnets is
      spaced in a region, a measurable level of repelling appears to
      occur over the entire region.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] High-pull-force magnets have been demonstrated by Applicant
      to act as acceptable repellents of elasmobranchs. The repellent
      activity of high-pull-force magnets has been shown to be better
      than existing shark-repellent technology with the exception of
      certain chemical repellents being developed by SHARK DEFENSE LLC
      that have a greater range of action.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] A. Magnetic Forces<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The force of a magnet may be measured in a variety of ways.
      Gauss is a unit of the density of a magnet's flux (or flux
      density) measured in centimeter-gram-second. A tesla is equal to
      10,000 gauss. Gauss and tesla are known common units for referring
      to the power of a magnet to attract (or repel) other magnets or
      magnetic materials. The Gauss unit describes both the coercivity
      of a magnet and its saturation magnetization. Basically, it
      describes how strong the magnetic fields are extending from the
      magnet and how strong of a magnetic field it would take to
      de-magnetize the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The pull force of a magnet is related to the magnet's
      nominal strength in gauss or teslas but uses the nominal strength
      to create a practical measure of a magnets ability to apply a
      pulling force on materials that are attracted to a magnetic field,
      such as ampullae of Lorenzini in elasmobranch. Pull force is
      related to the flux density of the magnet's magnetic field (in
      gauss or tesla) and the shape of the magnet. Pull force is
      calculated using the following equation: Pull Force=0.576*Br
      &lt;2&gt;*(Th)*A &lt;1/2 &gt;where Br=Flux Density in KiloGauss,
      Th=Thickness of Magnetized Surfaces in inches and A=Surface Area
      of the magnet in inches. Using this equation, a magnet's pull
      force may be determined A high pull force value for magnets is
      greater than about 50 pounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The strength of a magnet's magnetic field is inversely
      related to the distance an object is from the magnet. As such,
      magnets of very low strength (or gauss) may repel elasmobranchs if
      the elasmobranch moves close enough to sense the magnetic field of
      the magnet. A high-pull-force magnet having sufficient strength to
      repel an elasmobranch at sufficient distance such that the
      elasmobranch is deterred from striking a baited hook or coming
      near a person or other subject is preferred. It is more preferred
      that a high-pull-force magnet have a pull force of at least 100
      pounds to provide sufficient magnetic force to repel an
      elasmobranch away from a baited hook or a person before the
      elasmobranch may bight the hook or harm the person. Because an
      elasmobranch may act to strike a hook or person at a distance from
      the target, the stronger the high-pull-force magnet, the more
      effective it will be. It has been reported that magnets have a
      beneficial health effect in humans and a negative health effect in
      humans at high power. Applicant makes no representation herein of
      the safety of use of high-pull-force magnets by humans during
      short- or long-term use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>II. METHODS AND DEVICES FOR MAGNETIC REPELLENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0054] A. Magnets<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Exemplary and non-limiting high-pull-force magnets in
      accordance with the invention may be constructed of any material
      that is capable of generating a magnetic field without requiring
      an outside energy source (such a permanent ferrous magnet).
      Magnetism may be generated in any manner known to the skilled
      artisan who is practicing aspects of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] There are many varieties of permanent magnet materials
      including neodymium magnets (which are some of the most powerful
      permanent magnets known at this time), samarium-cobalt magnets,
      ceramic magnets, plastic magnets, Alnico magnets as well as
      traditional ferrous magnets. Any magnetic material having
      sufficient pull force may be used as a repellent of elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Exemplary permanent magnets include neodymium-iron-boride
      (NdFeB) magnets, ferrous metal magnets, samarium-cobalt magnets,
      or any other magnetic material. High-pull-force magnets may be
      flexible or inflexible. High-pull-force magnets may be made of
      sintered metal powder or of metal or any other magnetizable
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A preferred magnetic material for high-pull-force magnets
      contemplated within an aspect of the invention is NdFeB. NdFeB is
      a more preferred material than ferrous magnets, flexible magnets
      or samarium-cobalt magnets. Flexible magnetic strips may be
      constructed from magnetic powder such as ferrous or other powder
      mixed with polymer bonding material such as rubber-like material.
      Samarium-cobalt magnets are less preferred in that they may be
      more brittle than other magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In selecting a high-pull-force magnet, a pull force of
      about 50 pounds or greater is preferred. A pull force of about 100
      pounds or greater is more preferred since the impact of the
      magnetic field will felt at a greater distance from the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Neodymium-iron-boride magnets, commonly called "rare
      earth," "NdFeB," or "NIB" magnets, typically meet or exceed
      residual inductances greater than about 5,000 gauss, which is
      preferred. Residual inductance defines how changing magnetic
      fields generate electric currents and is also measured in gauss.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In order to maximize high pull force, the surface area of a
      magnet may be maximized. For example, a 6'' diameter by 2'' thick
      cylindrical N38 NdFeB magnet (nominal strength 13000 gauss; pull
      force 1042 pounds) may be effective in repelling elasmobranchs at
      a range of 6''.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] A plurality of magnets may be employed to repel
      elasmobranchs. For example, 1'' cube magnets may be arranged in a
      12'' long bar and used to repel elasmobranchs. The cube magnets
      may be of any magnetic material capable of producing sufficient
      magnetic strength at any distance of interest from the magnet to
      repel elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Alternatively, a plurality of 1'' cube magnets may be
      arranged linearly with a distance between each magnet. The magnets
      may be arranged linearly with positive poles facing one another or
      may be arranged with positive poles facing negative poles. Smaller
      magnets are also effective in repelling elasmobranchs and may
      preferably be arranged to maximize surface area presented to an
      oncoming elasmobranch.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Metals with special magnetic properties may be used in
      conjunction with permanent magnets in order to maximize or shape
      the magnetic flux profile of the magnet and thereby increase the
      pull force by directing the magnetic force more powerfully at an
      elasmobranch of choice. For example, holmium metal, which
      possesses the highest magnetic moment of the known elements, may
      be used to optimize the magnetic flux profile. A 1.5'' holmium
      ring with a drilled 0.5'' diameter center, coupled to an NdFeB
      1.5'' diameter cylindrical magnet, produced aversive reactions in
      immobilized sharks when the holmium end was oriented to the
      shark's nares. Other materials that may also be used, among
      others, for controlling the shape of the magnetic flux of a magnet
      may be gadolinium; pyrolytic graphite; mu-metal (a nickel-iron
      alloy comprising copper and molybdenum that has a very high
      magnetic permeability and is, therefore, very effective at
      screening magnetic fields); and bismuth.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] To protect permanent magnets from corrosion when placed in
      water, permanent magnets may be coated with any coating that will
      reduce corrosion and preserve the magnetic force of the magnet.
      For example, magnets may be coated with nickel, rubber, plastic,
      acrylic, enamel, paint or other coating. Nickel-plated NdFeB
      magnets are an example of preferred high-pull-force magnets so
      long as the coating remains intact.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] It may be desirable to encase a magnet in paint. Black
      paint is a preferred paint color to avoid underwater reflections
      and flashes of sunlight from the magnet's surface that can act as
      an attractant. A magnet may also be enclosed in any waterproof
      housing, such as a polymer coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] B. High-Pull-Force Magnets in Combination with Hooks<br>
      <br>
      [0068] A non-limiting aspect of the present invention is the use
      of high-pull-force magnets to repel elasmobranchs from baited
      hooks. Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of a
      high-pull-force magnet and a hook are illustrated in FIGS. 1-4.
      For example, in FIG. 1, an exemplary and non-limiting circle hook
      and line ( 100) are illustrated wherein a circle hook ( 140) is
      attached to a line ( 150) along with an exemplary and non-limiting
      Zone I in the circle hook and line where a high-pull-force magnet
      may be placed or affixed. The preferred region (Zone I) for magnet
      placement along the line ( 150) or shank ( 142) of the hook is any
      region wherein the affixed or placed magnet does not obstruct the
      hook gap distance (Zone II). Not more than 20% of the hook gap
      distance (Zone II) is preferably obstructed by the magnet such
      that the hook is not prevented from being baited or setting in the
      corner of the mouth of a target fish. Nevertheless, any
      arrangement wherein the hook is not prevented from catching target
      fish is acceptable. Tapered conical designs (not illustrated) are
      contemplated such that the diameter of the high-pull-force magnet
      at the hook end is smaller than the diameter of the
      high-pull-force magnet at the line end of Zone I.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of a high-pull
      force magnet on a hook and line are illustrated in FIGS. 2A-C. As
      in FIG. 2A, a high-pull-force magnet ( 210) may be placed in
      proximity to a circle or offset circle hook ( 240) attached to a
      line ( 250) so that it rests on the hook eye ( 241) providing an
      exemplary embodiment such as the hook-magnet combination embodied
      at 260. As in FIG. 2B, a high-pull-force magnet ( 210) may be
      placed in proximity to a circle or off-set circle hook ( 240) so
      that it rests on the shank ( 242) of the hook providing an
      exemplary embodiment such as the hook-magnet combination embodied
      at 270. As in FIG. 2C, a high-pull-force magnet ( 210) may be
      placed on a circle or offset circle hook ( 240) so that it is
      secured to the outside of the shank ( 242) and the hook eye ( 241)
      providing an exemplary embodiment such as the hook-magnet
      combination embodied at 280. A high-pull-force magnet may be
      affixed outside the shank ( 241) of a hook simply by the magnetic
      force of the high-pull-force magnet. Vinyl electric tape (not
      illustrated) may be used to secure the high-pull-force magnet.
      Black vinyl tape is preferred to reduce reflections of light.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] High-pull-force magnets may be provided in any shape. It is
      preferred that a magnet's shape not significantly obstruct the
      hook gap distance (zone II). The magnet may comprise a hole
      through which a lead, or gangion, or mainline or other filamentous
      object may pass. Exemplary non-limiting shapes may include a cube
      or block of any size or other object having at least one plane
      comprising four right angles and a hole passing through the object
      such that fishing line or other filament may be passed through to
      affix the magnet in place on fishing tackle or other object.
      Alternative, non-limiting shapes may also include cylindrical or
      other circular, oval or oblong three-dimensional shapes having a
      hole passing through some portion of the shape. Alternative,
      non-limiting shapes may also include a hollow pyramid or a hollow
      trapezoid.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Alternative, non-limiting shapes may also include a solid
      cube or similar shape, a solid rectangle or similar shape, a solid
      bar or similar shape, a solid pyramid or similar shape, a solid
      trapezoid or similar shape or any other shape. Magnets may be
      shaped as a ring, a trapezoid, a series of trapezoids, a series of
      trapezoids arranged in a larger ring pattern, a cone, a tapered
      cone, a narrow or wide cylinder or in the shape of a Billy club.
      Preferably, the shape when combined with a hook provides a hook in
      proximity to a magnet comprising sufficient magnetic field
      strength to repel elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of a
      high-pull-force magnet and a hook are also illustrated in FIGS.
      3A-C. As in FIG. 3A, a high-pull-force magnet ( 310) may be placed
      in proximity to a j-hook ( 340) on a line ( 350) such that it
      rests on the hook eye ( 341) providing an exemplary embodiment
      such as the hook-magnet combination embodied at 360. As in FIG.
      3B, a high-pull-force magnet ( 310) may be placed in proximity to
      a j-hook ( 340) such that it rests on the shank ( 342) of the hook
      providing an exemplary embodiment such as the hook-magnet
      combination embodied at 370. As in FIG. 3C, a high-pull-force
      magnet ( 310) may be placed on a j-hook ( 340) such that it is
      secured to the outside of the shank ( 342) and the hook eye ( 341)
      providing an exemplary embodiment such as the hook-magnet
      combination embodied at 380. As described above in the
      illustration of FIG. 2, magnets may be provided in any shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of magnet and hook
      are also illustrated in FIGS. 4A-B. In FIG. 4A, a high-pull-force
      magnet ( 410) may be placed in proximity to a treble hook ( 440)
      on a line ( 450) such that it rests on the hook eye ( 441)
      providing an exemplary embodiment such as the hook-magnet
      combination embodied at 460. As in FIG. 4B, a magnet ( 410) may be
      placed in proximity to a treble hook ( 440) such that it contacts
      the shank ( 442) of the hook providing an exemplary embodiment
      such as the hook-magnet combination embodied at 470.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] A hook in accordance with the invention may be any hook
      that is capable of catching target fish. The hook may comprise
      stainless steel, steel, galvanized metals, ferromagnetic metals or
      any other material, metallic or plastic or any other composite.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A high-pull-force magnet in accordance with an aspect of
      the invention may comprise any magnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] C. High-Pull-Force Magnets on Longlines<br>
      <br>
      [0077] An exemplary and non-limiting method of repelling
      elasmobranchs involving repelling elasmobranchs from longlines in
      accordance with the invention is illustrated in FIG. 5. A longline
      ( 500) may be deployed from a boat ( 561) to fish for a target
      fish of interest. The main line ( 550) of the longline may be
      attached to a buoy ( 520) and at a set distance from the buoy may
      be attached to an anchor ( 562). A set of gangions ( 530) with
      hooks ( 540) may be attached to the mainline beginning at the
      anchor ( 562) and may be spaced sufficiently to limit interaction
      between individual gangion lines ( 530). Each hook may have a
      magnet ( 510) mounted resting on the hook eye ( 541).
      Alternatively, the magnet may be mounted on a hook shank ( 542) or
      may be secured to the outside of the hook ( 540). The hooks may be
      baited. The longline may be a demersal longline such that the main
      line is proximal to the ocean or otherwise water's floor. The
      longline may be a pelagic long line, such that the main line is
      nearer to the surface of the water, suspending in the water
      column, typically at about 100 to about 500 feet below the
      surface. In the aspect of the invention where the longline is a
      pelagic longline, anchors ( 562) may have less weight or may be
      absent from the longline apparatus. The longline may also be a
      semipelagic longline wherein the mainline is further down the
      water column from the surface as compared to a pelagic line but is
      not proximal to the water's floor or is not proximal to the
      water's floor on at least one end of the longline. Use of magnets
      with longlines reduces by-catch of elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Longlines comprising magnets may be handled in the
      commercial environment in a manner similar to those practices
      known in the art of longline commercial fishing. Because hooks
      must be carefully managed to control tangling and hooking of
      objects on a longlining boat, including other portions of the
      tackle of the longline, commercial fishing operations and those of
      skill in the art will recognize how to handle longlines with
      hooks. High-pull-force magnets on longlines likewise may be
      handled in the same manners as one would consider appropriate in
      the art to avoid entanglements of magnets or magnets sticking
      together. The long distances between gangions (often more than 100
      feet) allow for commercial fishing operators to provide sufficient
      distance between magnets to avoid the magnets sticking together
      during fishing or during handling of tackle. Further,
      high-pull-force magnets used for longlines are of sufficiently
      small size and magnetic force that the magnets may be separated
      from one another by hand if they do become stuck together.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] As described above, high-pull-force magnets of any size may
      be used in combination with a longline hook so long as the target
      fish may be caught on the hook. An exemplary high-pull-force
      magnet on a longline hook may be 2''*0.25''*2''. Smaller
      high-pull-force magnets are also acceptable. High-pull-force
      magnets of less than 0.5'' cubed may be appropriate for smaller
      hook settings. Smaller high-pull-force magnets having sufficiently
      powerful magnetic fields such as N48 grade NdFeB are more
      preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] D. High-Pull-Force Magnet Repellents on Buoys, Nets and
      Barges<br>
      <br>
      [0081] An exemplary and non-limiting method of repelling
      elasmobranchs with a high-pull-force magnet or a plurality of
      high-pull-force magnets placed on a buoy or barge or net is
      illustrated in FIGS. 6A-B. Buoys with high-pull-force magnets as
      their weighted bases are shown as element 660 and 661 in FIG. 6A.
      The floating portion of the buoy ( 620) allows the buoy to float
      while the high-pull-force magnet portion of the buoy ( 610)
      remains in the water because of its weight. A series of buoys
      comprising high-pull-force magnets may be placed in a region to
      repel elasmobranchs or may be placed around a swimming area or
      rescue area to repel elasmobranchs. A series of buoys with
      high-pull-force magnets may be accompanied by a series of
      high-pull-force magnets submerged ( 611) in an area of interest,
      such as a swimming area. As illustrated in FIG. 6B, very large
      high-pull-force magnets may be placed on a large floating barge (
      670) comprising a high-pull-force magnet ( 610).<br>
      <br>
      [0082] An exemplary and non-limiting device for repelling
      elasmobranchs with a plurality of magnets is illustrated in FIG.
      6A as element 600, an elasmobranch repelling net apparatus. Buoys
      ( 660 and 661) may be employed to float a net ( 650) comprising a
      series of magnets ( 640) held within the net and magnetic rings (
      630) holding the ropes of the net together. The net may be strung
      to the bottom of the water column using weighted magnets ( 611).
      The net may be anchored to a specific location to provide a
      physical barrier. The net may provide a curtain of magnetic field
      to repel elasmobranchs from an area or to keep elasmobranchs from
      entering an area of interest, such as a swimming or working area.
      A net ( 650) comprising magnets such as those illustrated as
      elements 610, 611, 630 and 640 may also be used to trawl for fish,
      shrimp or other aquatic species. In another non-limiting aspect of
      the invention, high-pull-force magnets may be placed in
      aquaculture cages to repel sharks from predation or scavenging of
      cultured stock. High-pull-force magnets are useful to prevent
      damage by elasmobranchs to aquaculture cages, nets or other
      equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] E. Surfboard Fitted with High-Pull-Force Magnet<br>
      <br>
      [0084] A non-limiting repelling device in accordance with the
      invention may comprise a surfboard comprising a high-pull-force
      magnetic device. FIG. 7A illustrates exemplary surfboards in
      accordance with an aspect of the invention. A surfboard ( 720) may
      comprise a high-pull-force magnetic device such as a permanent
      high-pull-force magnet ( 710) imbedded, affixed, attached or
      otherwise associated in any manner contemplated by one of skill in
      the art with the surfboard. A permanent high-pull-force magnet may
      be pressed into a space drilled into the surfboard ( 730). It may
      also be affixed with glue, waterproof tape, Velcro or any other
      mechanism known in the art now and hereafter.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In an alternative non-limiting example in FIG. 7B, a
      surfboard ( 750) may comprise a high-pull-force magnet or
      plurality of high-pull-force magnets in association with one
      another wherein the high-pull-force magnet or magnets are capable
      of spinning when placed in water ( 740). Such a spinning
      high-pull-force magnet ( 740) may comprise individual magnets
      attached to a hub ( 770) that is attached to an axle ( 760) to
      allow free spinning of the high-pull-force magnet or magnets
      attached to the surfboard ( 750) when water current is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] A high-pull-force magnet may be enclosed in the body of a
      surfboard or other watercraft or may be trailed behind a
      surfboard, other watercraft or swimmer.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] F. High-Pull-Force Magnet Repellents on Swimming and Diving
      Clothing and Accessories<br>
      <br>
      [0088] One exemplary non-limiting aspect of the present invention
      comprises a magnetic material for producing a magnetic field near
      a swimmer or diver or other person or object in an elasmobranch
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] High-pull-force magnets, such as, for example,
      high-pull-force NdFeB magnets or other high-pull-force permanent
      magnets may be worn as a bracelet or a band or otherwise placed in
      proximity of a person or object. An increase in the number of
      high-pull-force magnets and an increase in the grade of
      high-pull-force magnets that may be worn increases the magnetic
      field around the wearer and increases the repelling activity of
      the bracelet, band or other magnet article. Research on captive
      nurse sharks suggests that such a bracelet is effective in
      repelling sharks. Using a vinyl-walled tank, high-pull-force
      magnets were waved outside the tank wall near a resting nurse
      shark inside the tank. The shark had no olfactory, motion, sound,
      or visual clues. In seven separate observations, the nurse shark
      always rapidly fled from its resting site once the high-pull-force
      magnet was waved on the tank wall near the subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In a non-limiting example, an omnidirectional permanent
      magnetic field may be affixed or arranged near a subject or object
      exposed to an elasmobranch environment. The permanent magnetic
      field may be generated from, for example, a permanent magnet or an
      electromagnet. A permanent magnet may be affixed, for example, to
      any portion of a swimmer's or diver's body such as the head, the
      leg, the arm, the torso, the ankle, the wrist, or any other
      portions of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] FIGS. 8A-C illustrate non-limiting examples of permanent
      high-pull-force magnets ( 810) attached to a belt ( 801) ( FIG.
      8A) or bracelet ( 802) ( FIG. 8B) or flippers ( 803) ( FIG. 8C).<br>
      <br>
      [0092] FIG. 9 illustrates a variety of non-limiting alternative
      designs for bracelets, belts or rings constructed solely from
      high-pull-force magnets. A plurality of bar magnets ( 981) ( 982)
      ( 983), larger spherical magnets of varying sizes ( 984) or
      smaller spherical magnets ( 985) may be shaped into a bracelet or
      belt. A plurality of discs ( 986) may be shaped into a bracelet or
      a belt or any shape that keeps the magnets in proximity to the
      body. Two concave bar magnets ( 987) may be placed on the ankle or
      wrist opposite each other such that they are held in place on the
      ankle or wrist by attractive magnetic forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The bracelets in FIG. 9 may be flexible and may be
      modulated to fit a portion of the body. Individual magnets of the
      bracelet may be easily separated and placed on the ankle or wrist.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The disks ( 986) may be magnetized on their edges and not
      magnetized on their faces. As such, the disks may be assembled as
      a ring using magnetic connections on their edges. The disks may be
      manipulated and may be returned to a circle. As such, they may
      conform to a ring to attach to any type of clothing, equipment or
      body part to which a ring may be attached.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] High-pull-force magnets may likewise be attached to
      clothing or water accessories such as swim trunks, wet suits,
      headbands, flippers, goggles or other piece of clothing or
      accessory. High-pull-force magnets may be sewn into such clothing
      or may be affixed with tape, glue, Velcro or any other mechanism
      for affixing to clothing or accessories for swimming, diving or
      otherwise working or playing in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Many human-shark interactions in shallow water, especially
      around the State of Florida in the United States, are hypothesized
      to be "mistaken identity" by the shark in water with poor
      visibility. The blacktip shark ( C. limbatus) and nurse shark ( G.
      cirratum) are often implicated in these encounters. The sharks do
      not have an olfactory clue in most of these "mistaken identity"
      cases. A series of high-pull-force magnets, such as NdFeB
      high-pull-force magnets or other strong permanent high-pull-force
      magnets, may be used as means to repel the shark as it approaches
      within a few inches of the magnets. With a strong high-pull-force
      magnet, such as NdFeB, or an increased number of high-pull-force
      magnets, to increase magnetic field strength, repellent activity
      increases and the chance that a shark will be repelled prior to an
      investigatory bump or bite is greatly increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The invention is further described with the following
      non-limiting examples, which are provided to further illuminate
      aspects of the invention.<br>

      <br>
      [0099] Pull force is descriptive of the attractiveness of a magnet
      to a steel flat surface. A shark is not a magnetic steel surface,
      but it does have a surface (likely the ampullae of Lorenzini) that
      interacts with the magnetic field of the magnet. As such, pull
      force is an appropriate method for measuring interaction of an
      elasmobranch with a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2<br>
      High-Pull-Force Magnets as Repellents on Longlines<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The following example demonstrates the elasmobranch
      repellent activity of high-pull-force magnets of greater than
      about 150 pounds of pull force on long lines. High-pull-force
      magnet treatments were evaluated on one demersal longline located
      in the middle of a large lagoon. Adjacent longlines in the same
      lagoon produced large shark catch (generally greater than two
      sharks over the 15 hooks on a line).<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Seven hooks on a demersal longline of about 1000 feet were
      treated with 2''*0.25''*2'' NdFeB N48 magnets (nominal force
      14,000 gauss; pull force about 161 pounds). The high-pull-force
      magnets were secured at even-numbered hooks on the longline,
      directly above the eye of the hook and strapped to the gangion
      leader with black vinyl electrical tape. All hooks received bait.
      If the bait was lost during the experiment, the hook was re-baited
      while the high-pull-force magnets were not removed or replaced;
      only the bait was exchanged.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] A large nurse shark of about 250 cm was captured on a
      control hook (hook with no magnet affixed) after a second re-bait.
      From earlier longline trials at this spot, a much higher nurse
      catch was expected on this line, especially since the
      high-pull-force magnets acted as weights and held the baits closer
      to the sea floor. However, only one nurse shark was caught. As
      such, it is believed sharks were repelled from the entire longline
      by the series of high-pull-force magnets affixed thereto.<br>

      High-Pull-Force Magnets as Repellents on Longlines<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The following example demonstrates the elasmobranch
      repellent activity of high-pull-force magnets of greater than 50
      pounds of pull force on long lines. A first demersal longline with
      eight hook sets was baited with barracuda flesh and placed in open
      water. No high-pull-force magnets were placed on the hooks. Five
      sharks were captured on the longline over 24 hours representing 5
      separate shark species ranging in size from 97 cm to 240 cm. See
      Table 3.<br>

      <br>
      [0104] A second demersal longline with fifteen hook sets was
      baited with squid and placed in the same position in open water as
      the first demersal longline discussed above for 67 hours. The
      trial with the second demersal longline was run three months after
      the trial with the first demersal longline. Seven of the fifteen
      hooks were treated with 1''*1*''*1" neodymium-iron-boride grade
      N48 cube magnets (pull force of about 110 pounds; nominal force
      around 14,000 gauss) with the high-pull-force magnet secured to
      the outside of the hook shank using the magnetic force of the hook
      and black vinyl electric tape. All hooks received bait. During
      re-baits, the high-pull-force magnets were not removed or
      replaced; only the bait was exchanged.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Two small sharks were caught on the second demersal
      longline. A blacknose shark of 110 cm was caught on a control line
      with no magnets. A sharpnose shark of 80 cm was caught on
      high-pull-force magnet line. The large decrease in shark catch
      between the first demersal longline trial (five relatively large
      sharks for their species) and the second demersal longline trial
      (two relatively small sharks) was ascribed to the presence of
      magnets along the longline. See Table 4.<br>

      [0106] A third demersal longline was set with 15 hooks in the same
      position as the first and second demersal longlines discussed
      above. The third demersal longline was set within a day of the
      second demersal longline. Seven of the eight hooks were fixed with
      magnets at the same position. Magnets were small NdFeB grade N50
      hollow cylinders (12 mm outer diameter*6.1 mm inner diameter). Two
      magnets were placed on each hook creating a total magnet length of
      50 mm. Together the magnets have a pull force of about 47 pounds
      and a nominal force of 14,100 gauss. The demersal line was placed
      in the same open water position as both demersal lines in Example
      3. Within a 24-hour period, 3 large (&gt;200 cm) tiger sharks were
      captured, 2 on magnet treatments. The smaller (less powerful)
      magnets did not repel tiger sharks.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Since a larger number of sharks (and of larger size) were
      caught on the first and third longlines, the three trials
      presented in this example demonstrate that sharks were repelled
      from the second longline comprising magnets of sufficient magnetic
      strength to repel sharks. Together, the three longline trials
      contained in this example demonstrate repelling of sharks by
      magnets of sufficient magnetic strength to repel sharks across a
      longline.<br>
      <br>
      Example 4<br>
      High-Pull-Force Magnet Terminates Tonic Immobility at Greater than
      30 cm Distance<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Preliminary research conducted on the effects of specific
      magnetic fields on shark behavior suggests that weak magnetic
      fields (0.3-0.5 Gauss) produced by electromagnets had no
      significant repelling effect on juvenile nurse sharks,
      Ginglymostomata cirratum, and juvenile lemon sharks ( Negaprion
      brevirostris) under tonic immobility, however, very strong
      magnetic fields (i.e. about 14,000 Gauss or 1.4 Tesla) produced by
      large (4''diameter*1.5'' height) "rare earth" magnets
      (neodymium-iron-boride; NdFeB) (13000 gauss, pull force of 521
      pounds) had a significant repelling effect on both shark species
      at distances of 0.3 m or less. Additional experiments on captive
      sharks in an offshore, sandy bottom, fenced-in enclosure were done
      with NdFeB high-pull-force magnets buried under the sand. Exposure
      of the sharks to the buried magnets resulted in "violent
      reorientation" as the captive sharks came into proximity of the
      buried high-pull-force magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Example 5<br>
      Y-Maze Preference Bioassays<br>
      <br>
      [0109] A Y-maze was constructed to establish a preference test to
      determine the repellent activity of magnets on elasmobranchs. The
      maze was constructed of three sections of clear acrylic 8 inch
      diameter tubing, connected at 33[deg.] angles to form a Y-shape.
      Slotted guides were secured to the entrances of each tube, to
      allow the insertion of a moveable door, which obstructs one exit.
      The entire maze was submerged in a test tank. Sharks were allowed
      to freely enter the maze and exit the maze. A high-pull-force
      magnet was placed, south pole facing the maze junction, in an
      obstructed leg of the maze, preventing an exit from the maze in
      that direction if that obstructed leg is chosen. The diameter of
      the tubing was sufficient to allow juvenile nurse sharks, juvenile
      lemon sharks, and juvenile wobbegong sharks to enter and pass
      through, but it was small enough to prevent the specimen from
      turning around within the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] For each trial, uncooked shrimp were used as a reward, and
      the south pole of a 4'' diameter NdFeB nickel-coated cylindrical
      high-pull-force magnet (pull force 521 pounds; nominal force about
      13000 gauss) was placed in the obstructed leg. One shrimp was
      positioned midway into the entrance tube to entice the shark to
      enter the maze. Two shrimp were placed midway into the exit tube,
      and two shrimp were placed midway into the tube containing the
      magnet. When the shark entered the maze and reached the
      Y-junction, the shark was presented with approximately the equal
      odor gradient from the shrimp in the exit tube and the tube
      containing the magnet. If the shark chose the maze without the
      high-pull-force magnet, it was rewarded with two additional shrimp
      as it exited. If the shark chose the maze with the high-pull-force
      magnet, it was subjected to an exponentially-increasing magnetic
      field as it moved down the tube. The shark could only physically
      back out of the high-pull-force magnet tube and into the junction.
      Sharks that moved into the magnet and attempted to back out were
      visible traumatized. Feeding observations regarding the two shrimp
      in the high-pull-force magnet tube were made.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Each trial was scored as follows:<br>
      <br>
      +1 Subject enters the maze<br>
      +1 Subject exits the maze<br>
      +1 Subject takes the first reward shrimp just after entry (teaser)<br>
      +2 The unobstructed path is chosen at the junction<br>
      +3 At least one reward shrimp in the unobstructed path is taken<br>
      -2 The obstructed path is chosen (magnet) at the junction<br>
      -3 The specimen enters more than 6'' into the obstructed path and
      is visibly struggling.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] A perfect score=7 for each trial. If a shark became
      traumatized and requires removal from the maze for its own safety,
      a score is calculated up to the point of the rescue. A rescue is
      made whenever a subject appears to be highly distressed, and a
      physical injury is likely.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] For example, a nurse shark entered the maze, took its first
      reward shrimp, and immediately chose the unobstructed path. As it
      exited, it took its two reward shrimp, and exited the maze without
      a change in behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Score=1+1+2+3=7<br>
      <br>
      [0121] In another example, a nurse shark entered the maze and took
      its first reward shrimp. It chose the obstructed path but was
      repelled by the magnet. The shark backed up into the Y-junction;
      reoriented itself; and exited the unobstructed path without taking
      the two shrimp available in the unobstructed path.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Score=1+1-2+1=1<br>
      <br>
      [0122] In yet another example, a lemon shark entered the maze and
      took its first reward shrimp. It chose the obstructed path, and
      then continued down the magnet to within 6'' of the magnet. It
      became extremely distressed and a rescue was made.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Score=1+1-2-3=-3<br>
      <br>
      [0123] In an investigation, three nurse sharks were subjected to
      the maze. Shark 1 was subjected to the maze five times. Shark 2
      was subjected to the maze 5 times but only entered the maze 4
      times. Shark 3 was subjected to the maze once but required rescue
      when it encountered the magnet and subsequently died, apparently
      from stress related to exposure to the magnet. The magnet in the
      obstructed maze was a 4''*1.5'' cylindrical NdFeB magnet of grade
      N48 (13000 gauss, 521 pounds pull force). The results are
      contained in Table 5.<br>

      [0124] The data suggest that Nurse 1 has learned to navigate the
      maze, retrieve a reward, and exit without distress. Nurse 2
      appears to be learning, but did not re-enter on the fifth trial.
      Nurse 3 had to be rescued. It was notably distressed by the
      magnet. Unfortunately, Nurse 3 did not eat after this experience,
      and subsequently died at about 30 days after the experiment. We
      did not observe any external injuries on Nurse 3. We attribute
      this to stress and possibly shock from encounter with the

      <br>
      [0125] Juvenile lemon sharks ( Negaprion brevirostris) and
      juvenile nurse sharks ( Ginglymostoma cirratum) that had been
      placed in tonic immobility were subjected to the magnetic field of
      an N48 neodymium-iron-boride (NdFeB) nickel-coated 4''*1.5''
      cylinder permanent high-pull-force magnet and were observed. The
      high-pull-force magnet had the following characteristics:<br>

      [0135] A DC milligauss magnetometer (Alpha Labs, Inc.) was used to
      record magnetic field strength during the study. The magnetometer
      sensor was secured to the top of a nonmagnetic [1/2]'' polyvinyl
      chloride stake, which was driven vertically into the sand at the
      test site. The magnetometer sensor was submerged for the study.
      Water depth did not exceed 36'' at the test site. A meter-long
      rule was secured to the magnetometer sensor.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] A control test was preformed in order to determine if the
      activated magnetometer sensor would terminate tonic immobility.
      The magnetometer was set to zero to compensate for the background
      magnetic field of the earth, which allowed fluctuations from the
      permanent magnet to be measured. A juvenile female lemon shark in
      tonic immobility was held directly at the magnetometer sensor.
      Tonic immobility did not terminate. The magnetometer readings did
      not fluctuate when the lemon shark was in proximity to the sensor
      demonstrating no change in magnetic field strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] Two 4'' cylindrical N48 grade NdFeB nickel-coated permanent
      high-pull-force magnets (nominal strength 14000 gauss, pull force
      about 521 pounds) were calibrated by observing the magnetic field
      strength versus distance from the magnet under water. The
      following data were recorded:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      &nbsp; TABLE 6<br>

      &nbsp; 0.6 m&nbsp; &gt;+2000<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Because the maximum reading of the magnetometer used in the
      experiments was 2000 mG, magnetic fields at distances less than
      0.6 m from the magnet were calculated using a standard gauss
      calculation for a cylindrical magnet. In this case, we used the
      calculator provided at
      www.arnoldmagnetics.com/mtc/calc_gauss_cyl.htm. The following
      parameters were in-put into the magnetic field calculator: L=4
      in.; D=1.5 in; Br=13,000 G; Z=distance from magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] With a juvenile shark subject to tonic immobility at the
      magnetometer sensor, the permanent magnet was moved along a
      stationary rule, level with the shark and the sensor, towards the
      shark. The high-pull-force magnet was not moved faster than 0.1
      m/s toward the shark. The following results were obtained for
      termination of tonic immobility. (Note: +denotes the north pole,
      electrically on the gaussmeter.)<br>

      [0139] Since the movement of the permanent high-pull-force magnet
      underwater induces an electrical current, the next study moved the
      tonic shark toward two stationary high-pull-force magnets, each
      fixed at 1.5m from the sensor. Tonic immobility was terminated
      when the sharks were brought within 0.2m of the high-pull-force
      magnet faces.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] It was consistently observed that tonic sharks awoke by
      turning away from the magnet's face. This was independent of the
      pole of the high-pull-force magnet, and the orientation of the
      shark's head toward the magnet. More violent responses occurred
      when the shark's head was oriented 90 degrees to the
      high-pull-force magnet face, rather than 0 degrees (nose-to-magnet
      face).<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The movement of the shark toward the high-pull-force
      magnet, as well as the movement of the high-pull-force magnet
      toward the shark might create electric current and awaken the
      shark. To eliminate this possibility, care was taken not to move
      the high-pull-force magnets in a rapid manner.<br>
      <br>

      [0142] In a first experiment using an electromagnetic device, an
      iron-core electromagnet was secured to the end of a PVC pole, and
      energized with 12 VDC using a marine wet-cell battery. Current was
      monitored using a digital multimeter. A tonic juvenile female
      lemon shark was held at the magnetometersensor, while the tip of
      the electromagnet was moved. The following results were obtained:<br>

      [0143] In a second experiment using an electromagnetic device, a
      commercial 1000 lb.-strength waterproof electromagnet, produced by
      L OCKNETICS, I NC., was energized with 12V DC using a marine
      wet-cell battery. According to the product specifications, this
      magnet draws a consistent 30A at 12 VDC, which exceeded the
      capability of the digital multimeter. A tonic juvenile female
      lemon shark was held at the magnetometersensor, while the face of
      the electromagnet was moved. The following results were obtained:<br>

      [0144] These two experiments demonstrate that despite strong
      electromagnetic fields in close proximity, such fields were not
      sufficient to terminate tonic immobility in juvenile nurse sharks
      and lemon sharks. The magnetic field strength was not sufficient
      to terminate tonic immobility.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] However, as seen above, a powerful field from an NdFeB
      permanent high-pull-force magnet is sufficient to terminate tonic
      immobility in juvenile nurse sharks and lemon sharks. It is
      believed that a field strength of approximately 50 G at least 0.1
      m distance from am elasmobranch reliably terminates tonic
      immobility. 50 gauss is about 100 times the Earth's magnetic
      field.<br>
      <br>
      Example 8<br>
      Bracelet, Belt or Other High-Pull-Force Magnet as Repellent of
      Shark<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Two lemon sharks in an outdoor pen were placed in tonic
      immobility. A blinder was placed between the sharks and a magnet
      having about 191 pounds of pull force and a nominal strength of
      about 14000 gauss. Upon introducing the magnetic bar up to about
      0.2 meters behind the blind, tonic immobility was terminated and
      the sharks violently moved in orientation away from the
      high-pull-force magnet.<br>
      <br>

      Bracelet as Repellent of Shark<br>
      <br>
      [0147] Research on captive nurse sharks suggests that a
      high-pull-force bracelet is effective in repelling sharks. Using a
      vinyl-walled tank, high-pull-force magnets were waved outside the
      tank wall near a resting nurse shark inside the tank. The shark
      had no olfactory, motion, sound, or visual clues. In seven
      separate observations, the nurse shark always rapidly fled from
      its resting site once the high-pull-force magnet was waved on the
      tank wall near the subject. When non-magnetic objects were waived
      at the same position outside the tank, no change in behavior was
      observed.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0148] Preliminary research conducted on the effects permanent
      magnetic fields on adult cobia, Rachycentron canadum, suggests
      that very strong magnetic fields (i.e. &gt;14,000 Gauss or 14
      Tesla) produced by "rare earth" magnets (NdFeB) (13,800 gauss, 110
      pounds pull force) had little effect on cobia during feeding.
      Digital video of cobia feeding within 5cm of the "rare earth"
      high-pull-force magnet was recorded. In three trials sardines were
      offered to the cobia on PVC tubes with no magnets inside. In three
      subsequent trials sardines were offered on PVC tubes with a
      high-pull-force magnet inside. The high-pull-force magnet was
      composed of 4 discs (1 '' diameter*[1/4]'' height) stacked on top
      of each other with Teflon(TM) rings between each magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] In another control test, squid was presented to yellowfin
      tuna in the presence of an NdFeB high-pull-force magnet of grade
      N48. A horizontal pole with six squid (and a corresponding
      high-pull-force magnet) hung equally spaced along the pole was
      presented to the tuna. The pole was lowered into the tank. The
      tuna took the bait in the presence of the high-pull-force magnets.
      The tuna were not repelled.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The ability to selectively repel elasmobranch is useful
      both for longline fishing applications (to catch target fish and
      avoid killing elasmobranch) and for human applications,
      particularly for divers and snorkelers (to repel elasmobranchs and
      not repel fish).<br>

      </b>A fishing hook with elasmobranch-repelling qualities is
      disclosed. The fishing hook, comprised of a ferromagnetic
      material, is rendered repellent to elasmobranchs through the
      incorporation of an exterior coating of an electropositive metal,
      and contact or impulse magnetization.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Pelagic longlining fishing is an open-ocean technique that
      employs a long mainline from which individual hooks are suspended
      at various depths depending on the target species. The hooks are
      attached to the main line by monofilament branch lines called
      gangions or "snoods". Floats are attached to the mainline at
      regular intervals to keep it elevated horizontally in the water
      column. A variety of bait types are employed, including whole
      small fish, Atlantic mackerel and squid, to name a few.
      Luminescent light sticks are often fastened to the gangions near
      the baited hooks, making them more attractive to the targeted
      species and also attracting smaller species on which targeted
      species feed. The longlines used by the United States domestic
      pelagic longline fleet range from 20 to 40 miles in length. The
      depth at which the hooks are set is controlled by the length of
      the lines attaching the main line to the floats, by the length of
      the gangions, and by the speed at which the longline gear is set.
      After a variable "soak time," the gear is retrieved, and the catch
      is brought on board for cleaning and icing down in the hold. This
      "one at a time" processing and handling gives longline products a
      high quality distinction in the marketplace.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Pelagic shark species such as the blue shark (Prionace
      glauca) are often attracted to miles of attractive stimuli
      resulting from the longlines. Shark interactions on pelagic
      longlines result in substantial inconveniences and adverse
      economic effects to fishers (Gilman, Clarke, Brothers,
      Alfaro-Shigueto, Mandelman, Mangel, Petersen, Piovano, Thomson,
      Dalzell, Donoso, Goren, Werner, 2007). In fisheries with
      restrictions on shark-finning, a lack of market for shark meat, or
      a per-trip limit on shark retention, shark interactions cause the
      following:<br>
      <br>
      Reduced catch of marketable species: When baited hooks are
      occupied by sharks (referred to as "bycatch") or removed by
      sharks, there are fewer hooks available to catch marketable target
      species;<br>
      Damage and loss of fishing gear: Sharks bite off terminal tackle
      (e.g., baited hook, leader, weighted swivel, and line) from branch
      lines, stretch and chafe branch lines, break the main line, and
      some shark species will pull the gear down causing branch lines to
      become entangled often resulting in large quantities of unusable
      fishing gear;<br>
      Risk of injury: It is dangerous for crew to handle caught sharks.
      There is a risk of being bitten or hit by weights when branch
      lines containing sharks snap during gear retrieval; and,<br>
      Expenditure of time. A majority of fishers consider the time
      required to remove sharks from gear, retrieve terminal tackle and
      repair and replace gear as a central concern resulting from shark
      interactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Responding to this problem, the inventors developed and
      commercialized two repellent materials which show selective shark
      repellent abilities for fisheries: Ferromagnets and
      electropositive metals. Both materials affect the electrosensitive
      ampullae of Lorenzini organ found only in sharks, as discussed
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Elasmobranch fishes (sharks and rays) geolocate using
      magnetoreception, a method used by a wide variety of marine and
      terrestrial organisms (Kalmijn, 1973, 1974, 1982, 1984; Phillips,
      1986; Carey and Scharold, 1990; Klimley, 1993; Wiltschko and
      Wiltschko, 1995; Holland et al. 1999). Organisms that employ
      magnetoreception typically gather information while in motion
      about geomagnetic parameters such as field intensity and the angle
      of inclination (Skiles, 1985).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] There are three primary ways in which an animal perceives
      the Earth's magnetic field: (1) magnetite-based magnetoreception
      (Kirschvink et al., 2001; Wiltschko et al., 2002) (2) chemical
      magnetoreception (Ritz et al., 2000), and (3) indirect
      magnetoreception via electromagnetic induction (Kalmijn, 1982,
      1984; Johnsen and Lohmann, 2005). Previous studies hypothesized
      that elasmobranchs perceive the Earth's geomagnetic fields through
      indirect magnetoreception via electromagnetic induction, and they
      use this locational information to navigate within coastal and
      pelagic environments (Kalmijn 1973, 1974, 1982, 1984; Carey and
      Scharold, 1990; Klimley 1993; Holland et al. 1999).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] To understand how the process of electromagnetic induction
      aids elasmobranchs in navigation, it is essential to understand
      the law of electromagnetic induction proposed by Faraday. The law
      states that the electromotive force induced in a circuit is
      directly proportional to the time rate of change of magnetic flux
      through the circuit. An application of this law employs the
      classic example of a simple generator (i.e. a coil conductor and a
      permanent magnet) to demonstrate how the movement of the permanent
      magnet induces a measurable electromotive force. As a magnetic
      dipole approaches the coil, the magnetic field exerts an
      electromotive force on the electrons within the coil, producing an
      electrical current. For example, on a molecular level, a permanent
      ferromagnetic material such as Barium-ferrite contains a
      greater-than-average number of magnetic domains oriented in the
      same direction, and within each domain, unpaired electrons have
      their spin aligned in the same direction. The resulting magnetic
      flux from the permanent magnet induces the movement of electrons
      in the coil/conductor creating measurable voltages and current.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A similar phenomenon occurs when an animal swims through a
      magnetic (or geomagnetic) field. Electromagnetic induction occurs
      as an animal swims through the geomagnetic field emanating from
      the center of the earth, which ranges from 0.25-0.65 gauss. The
      geomagnetic flux causes the free electrons found within an
      organism's body (similar to a conductive coil) to move, creating
      an induced voltage and current within the shark.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Hypothetically, elasmobranchs can perceive the induced
      voltages, using their acute electrosensory organ known as the
      ampullae of Lorenzini (Kalmijn, 1966, 1971, 1974, 1984). The
      electric potential created by the geomagnetic field is different
      than that of the electric potential found within the conductive
      gel of the ampullae. The difference in electric potentials
      initiates the transmission of a signal sent via the afferent
      neurons to the central nervous system of the elasmobranch.
      Multiple ampullae distributed across the cephalic (nose) region of
      the elasmobranch are able to detect the minute differences in the
      Earth's geomagnetic field enabling the organism to determine its
      relative geolocation. Studies of the swimming behavior of blue
      sharks (Prionace glauca; Scharold, 1990) and scalloped hammerheads
      (Sphyrna lewini, Klimley, 1993) concluded that their directional
      movement within the referenceless pelagic environment must involve
      some compass-like mechanism, although the physiological basis for
      such a mechanism was not described at that time. Meyer et al.
      (2005) exposed scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini) and sandbar
      sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus) to weak electromagnetic fields
      (maximum field strength 100 [mu]T), which altered their feeding
      behavior. This study supported the hypothesis that the ampullae of
      Lorenzini, a network of gel-filled canals on the head of
      elasmobranchs which detects electric fields in the final stages of
      prey capture (Kalmijn, 1971; Kajiura and Holland, 2002, Kajiura,
      2003) are also capable of detecting magnetic fields relatively
      close to that of the Earth's geomagnetic field. The ampullae are
      essentially low frequency voltmeters, allowing elasmobranchs to
      detect low frequency electric stimuli, i.e. less than 5 nV/cm in
      uniform fields and as low as 1 nV/cm in dipole fields Kalmijn
      1966, 1971, 1974, 1982; Kajiura 2003; Peters 2007).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] O'Connell (2007, 2008, 2009) found that for nurse sharks
      (Ginglymostoma cirratum) and southern stingrays (Dasyatis
      americana), the behavior towards a permanent magnet apparatus was
      dependant on the treatment type. In the presence of permanent
      magnets, D. americana and G. cirratum demonstrated a significantly
      greater number of avoidance behaviors towards the magnet side of
      the apparatus, while both species fed a significantly greater
      number of times from the procedural (nonmagnetic) control side.
      These results suggest that the species tested in this experiment
      were sensitive to these magnets and were successfully repelled
      from baited areas containing magnets.<br>

      [0015] On May 1, 2006, SharkDefense discovered that highly
      electropositive metals (EPMs)-metallic elements towards the left
      side of the periodic table-particularly early-Lanthanide or "rare
      earth" metals, induced deterrent behavior in juvenile lemon
      (Negaprion brevirostris) and nurse (Ginglymostoma cirratum)
      sharks. Subsequent to this discovery, SharkDefense applied for
      patents in the United States and Canada, which are currently
      pending. Not all seawater-corrodible metals, such a copper and
      zinc, are suitable as shark repellent EPMs. Shark repellency is a
      function of the standard reduction potential available from the
      metal in basic seawater electrolyte, relative to a shark's skin.
      The standard cell potential, E0, between the metal and shark skin
      must be 0.8 eV or greater. If a shark skin reference electrode is
      not available, a carbon electrode may be substituted. An
      electromotive force in a standard seawater (pH=8.1) electrolyte
      with a carbon-metal electrode spacing of at least 0.01 m should
      yield at least 0.5 eV, indicating satisfactory shark repellent. A
      standard cell potential is calculated from the half-cell reactions
      for the metal and the electrolyte. For example, the standard
      reduction potential of zinc metal in basic electrolyte is 1.246
      eV. Adding the -0.828 eV reduction for water, the standard cell
      potential is +0.418 eV. Zinc metal is not an effective shark
      repellent. By comparison, the standard reduction potential for
      yttrium metal (a trivalent EPM and confirmed shark repellent), is
      2.85 eV, giving a standard cell potential of 2.022 eV (Bard,
      1985). This corresponds closely to actual measurements made with
      yttrium metal and a shark fin clipping electrode in pH=8.1
      seawater at 25[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In response to the discovery several National Oceanographic
      and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), academic and private sector
      researchers conducted various experiments to evaluate the efficacy
      of employing EPMs as shark deterrent technology during commercial
      fishing. The Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center of the
      National Marine Fisheries Service, Honolulu, Hi. hosted a Shark
      Deterrent and Incidental Capture Workshop on Apr. 11, 2008 at the
      New England Aquarium, Boston, Mass. Researchers were invited to
      present on a variety of topics, including shark sensory biology,
      an overview of shark bycatch during pelagic longline fishing and
      an arsenal of shark deterring technologies offered by Shark
      Defense. The majority of the research presentations focused on the
      effects of EPMs on shark behavior and presented evidence on their
      efficacy as a shark bycatch reduction mechanism during commercial
      fishing. The following outline the major results presented during
      the workshop:<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Wang, Swimmer, and McNaughton (2008) reported repelling
      behavior of Galapagos (C. galapagensis) and sandbar (C. plumbeus)
      sharks when an EPM (Neodymium-Praseodymium mischmetal; NdPr) was
      placed on the end of a baited bamboo pole in preliminary studies
      in Hawaiian waters.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Stoner and Kaimmer (2007) conducted laboratory
      investigations on the effects of EPMs on spiny dogfish (S.
      acanthias) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). In a
      pairwise test with EPMs and inert metal controls, they reported
      that dogfish attacked and consumed baits protected with cerium
      (Ce) mischmetal at a significantly lower frequency than controls.
      Number of approaches before attacking the bait and time to attack
      the baits was significantly higher in the presence of mischmetal,
      as were numbers of approaches before first attack. No halibut
      aversion was reported. Encouraged by the results of the laboratory
      studies, Kaimmer and Stoner (2008) conducted field investigations
      using EPMs as a deterrent during commercial fishing for halibut
      near Homer, Ak. They reported a 17% reduction in spiny dogfish
      bycatch and a 48% reduction in bycatch of the clearnose
      skate-another elasmobranch with ampullae of Lorenzini
      electroreception abilities. They reported no noticeable aversion
      by the halibut and an associated 5% increase in halibut catch.
      Increases in halibut catch were most likely due to more hooks
      available to target species. Stoner and Kaimmer also conducted
      additional cerium mischmetal EPM trials during 2008 at the Oregon
      Coastal Aquarium (Newport, Oreg.) to observe the behavior of
      sharks in the presents of EPMs and lead controls suspended in the
      water column. Analysis of the video suggested that several species
      of sharks and rays avoided the EPM more than the lead control.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Brill et al., (2009) conducted EPM trials using small
      sandbar sharks (C. plumbeus) in a 3.6 m diameter*0.67 m deep pool.
      The experimental design consisted of an EPM treatment-three small
      ingots of NdPr mischmetal suspended in a vertical line immediately
      below the water surface-and a control-three small lead ingots of
      similar size and shape and similarly suspended in the water
      column-placed into the tank with the captive sharks. Their
      swimming patterns were recorded over one hour intervals and were
      subsequently digitized using Lolitrack automated video analysis
      software (Loligo Systems, Tjele, Denmark). They suggested that the
      NdPr mischmetal clearly exhibited potential to repel sharks and
      hand potential for reduction of shark bycatch during commercial
      longline fishing.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Brill (2009) also reported that in field trials with bottom
      longline gear, electropositive metal placed within 10 cm of the
      hooks reduced the catch of sandbar sharks by approximately two
      thirds, compared to the catch of sharks on hooks in proximity to
      plastic pieces of similar size and shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Although two 2008 studies involving spiny dogfish were
      inconclusive, the consensus of the workshop participants was that
      EPMs were a potential practical and promising shark deterrent
      technology for application in commercial fisheries.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] While ferromagnets and electropositive metals alone have
      both demonstrated shark repellency, species-specific behavioral
      variations have been reported by fishermen using these single
      materials (e.g., some sharks responded only to magnets and not to
      metals). For example, in 2008 field studies where spiny dogfish
      (Squalus acanthias) represent a large component of unwanted catch,
      Pacific spiny dogfish were repelled by electropositive metals
      (Stoner, Kaimmer, 2008), while Atlantic spiny dogfish were not
      (Tallack, Mandelman, 2009). Brown smooth hound sharks (Mustelis
      henlei) in Baja, Mexico were responsive to magnets but not to
      electropositive metals. (J. Wang, pers. comm.). In a 2008
      International Pacific Halibut Commission field study, unwanted
      catch of Pacific longnose skates was reduced 48% using
      electropositive metals (Stoner, 2008), while catch rates remained
      unaffected for Atlantic butterfly rays and southern stingrays
      (Dasyatis americana) using electropositive metals (Brill, 2009),
      yet southern stingrays in both the Florida Keys and South Bimini,
      Bahamas (D. americana) were responsive to permanent magnets
      (O'Connell, 2007, 2008, 2009). Current magnetic materials that
      combine electropositive metals and ferromagnetic metals, such as
      neodymium-iron-boride (NIB) and samarium-cobalt (SmCo) magnets,
      are unsuitable for commercial fishery use. NIB magnets are readily
      corroded by seawater due to the high iron content in its sinter.
      SmCo magnets offer better corrosion resistance but are brittle and
      are more expensive compared to ferrite materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The storage and deployment of the aforementioned shark
      repellent materials add additional challenges for fishermen. These
      materials must be stored onboard the vessel, and add to the
      expense when gear is lost due to shark interactions. During
      deployment, each magnetic or electropositive repellent device must
      be secured to a gangion, adding labor and time to the fishing
      effort. Storing hundreds of powerful NIB or SmCo magnets in close
      proximity onboard of a metal fishing vessel is not practical.
      These magnetic materials produce fluxes in excess of 1,000 Gauss,
      readily attracting other nearby magnetic metals. A lower flux
      magnetic material that maintains shark repellency is required.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] A demersal longline study was conducted by Coastal Carolina
      University during the summer of 2008 at Winyah Bay, S.C. using
      magnetized hooks ranging from 40 gauss to 80 gauss (much weaker
      than powerful rare earth magnets). The results of this study were
      compared to magnet-on-hook trials at the same location. A
      significantly lower number of sharks were captured using
      magnetized hooks than with the magnet-on-hook design ([chi]2=4.50,
      d.f.=1, p=0.0339). While magnet-on-hook trials significantly
      reduced the chances of capturing a shark by half ([chi]2=4.545,
      d.f.=1, p=0.0330), sharks were repelled from ALL hooks in the
      magnetized hook trials. The researchers recognized a temporal
      variation existed between longline studies, and therefore
      conducted tonic immobility trials with five juvenile lemon sharks
      (Negaprion brevirostris). Using magnetized hooks (54 gauss), all
      five subjects violently roused and terminated immobility when the
      magnetized hook was presented.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In summary, a fishing hook with magnetic flux ranging from
      5 to 80 Gauss and an electropositive coating is commercially
      desirable, as this would reduce attraction to other metals and
      tackle while maintaining shark repellency and high selectivity
      towards target catch.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0026] "By-catch" is any kind of fish that is caught in a fishing
      operation wherein the catching of the fish is not the object of
      the fishing operation. For example, if the target fish of a
      longline fishing operation is tuna, an elasmobranch caught on a
      hook of the longline is by-catch.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] "Elasmobranchs" in this specification means one or more
      elasmobranchii in the super-orders Galeomorphii and Squalomorphii
      and orders Squaliforms (dogfish), Carcharhiniformes (requiem
      sharks), Lamniformes (mackerel sharks), and Orectolobiformes
      (carpet sharks).<br>
      <br>
      [0028] "Electropositive" in this specification means possessing a
      revised Pauling electronegativity of less than 1.3. Examples of an
      electropositive metal suitable for use in the present invention
      are a Lanthanide (also referred to as Lanthanoid) metal, a Group 1
      metal, a Group II metal, a Group III metal, Magnesium metal, or an
      alloy of electropositive metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] "Ferromagnetic" in this specification means capable of
      retaining a magnetic characteristic after exposure to another
      magnetic field. Alloys of iron, cobalt, and many steels possess
      this property. Within ferromagnetic materials, the spin of
      unpaired electrons are aligned in the same direction. Also, a
      greater-than-average number of magnetic domains containing these
      aligned electrons are also aligned in the same direction, creating
      a net moment. This moment creates the familiar "north" and "south"
      poles of a permanent magnet or a ferromagnetic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] "Gauss" is a measure of magnetic field strength. Gauss is a
      unit of the density of a magnet's flux (or flux density) measured
      in centimeter-gram-second. A tesla is equal to 10,000 gauss. Gauss
      and tesla are common units for referring to the power of a magnet
      to attract (or repel) other magnets or magnetic materials. The
      Gauss unit describes both the coercivity of a magnet and its
      saturation magnetization. Gauss describes how strong the magnetic
      fields are extending from the magnet and how strong of a magnetic
      field it would take to de-magnetize the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] "Grade" of a neodymium-iron-boride magnet specifies the
      quality of material used to construct the magnet. All else being
      equal, the higher the quality of materials used to construct the
      magnet, the greater the magnet's strength. In grading
      neodymium-iron-boride magnets, a lower grade, e.g., N35 does not
      have as much magnetic strength as a higher grade, e.g. N45.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] "Hook" in this specification refers to a metal fishing hook
      for marine use. Fishing hooks are further divided into specialized
      shapes depending on the type of prey sought, such as circle hooks,
      J-hooks, and treble hooks. The metals used in the manufacture a
      fishing hook typically include steel or stainless steel, and
      optionally include cadium, tin, zinc, gold, or nickel platings.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] "Pull force" is the attractiveness of a magnet to a mild
      steel flat surface in pounds. The formula for calculating pull
      force is provided in detail herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] "Target fish" is any kind of fish, the catching of which is
      the object of a fishing operation. For example, the target fish of
      a longline fishing operation may be tuna. A fish that is caught on
      the longline that is not tuna would not be a target fish.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] "Tonic immobility" is the state of paralysis that typically
      occurs when an elasmobranch is subject to inversion of its body
      along the longitudinal axis of the body, i.e., is belly up. An
      elasmobranch can remain in this state for up to 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] While not wishing to be bound to a specific physiological
      mechanism, the inventor hypothesizes that weakly magnetized
      materials are capable of repelling elasmobranchs more efficiently
      than high pull force magnets. In recent experimentation with
      captive juvenile lemon sharks (N. brevirostris) and free-swimming
      blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) magnetic fluxes of 0.6 gauss to 100
      gauss measured at the hook were effective in reducing shark
      captures when compared to nonmagnetized control hooks. The
      inventors hypothesize that very high pull force magnets,
      particularly grade N38 and higher neodymium-iron-boride magnets,
      may be too strong to achieve consistent repellency with
      elasmobranchs. For example, rare earth magnets are capable of
      producing thousands of gauss near their surfaces. This is
      thousands of times greater than the Earth's geomagnetic signature
      that is observed around 500 milligauss. The presence of an overly
      powerful permanent magnetic flux may be so "unnatural" to an
      elasmobranch's ampullary organ that the organ does not register
      the effect at all, or nullifies it rather than produce an aversion
      signal. In contrast, a weakly magnetized steel fishing hook may
      only produce 100 gauss at its surface, and this is only 200 times
      stronger than the Earth's geomagnetic signature. This effect was
      observed using the tonic immobility bioassay with juvenile lemon
      sharks (N. brevirostris). The sharks terminated tonic immobility
      more often when weakly magnetized hooks were presented versus
      powerful rare earth magnets.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The strength of the magnetic flux decreases with the
      inverse cube of the distance from the magnetized hooks surface. A
      shark would experience less than 10 gauss only a few inches from
      the magnetized hook.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Cobalt and Iron are examples of ferromagnetic elements at
      room temperature. Steel, low-austenitic stainless steels,
      Samarium-Cobalt, Sendust, Neodymium-Iron-Boride, Permalloy,
      Supermalloy, Alnico, Bismanol, CuNiFe, Heusler alloy, and Fernico
      are examples of room-temperature ferromagnetic alloys. Some
      ferromagnetic materials, are strong enough to be used directly as
      a fishing hook. Steel and 400-series stainless steels are examples
      of materials suitable for use as the entire fishing hook. Soft
      alloys, such as Bismanol, do not possess this structural integrity
      and therefore are more useful as a coating or external treatment
      on an existing fishing hook.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A nonmagnetized ferromagnetic hook is made magnetic by
      exposing the hook to another permanent magnet or an energized
      electromagnet. Preferably, the nonmagnetized hook is placed in
      physical contact with a permanent magnet, such as a Barium-ferrite
      ceramic magnet. A nonmagnetized ferromagnetic hook may also be
      magnetized by placing it in close proximity to an electrified
      coil, commonly found on electromagnets. The magnetization process
      is nearly instantaneous and is reversible by heating above the
      Curie temperature, repeated mechanical shock, or degaussing
      equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Weakly magnetized hooks are also desirable to fishermen for
      four reasons. First, in many commercial fisheries, sharks comprise
      a significant portion of by-catch. More by-catch equates to less
      target fish and potential loss of income and tackle. For this
      reason, it is very desirable for fishermen to have a shark
      by-catch reduction device which does not affect the target fish.
      Permanent magnets fulfill this requirement. Secondly, there is no
      additional tackle in the form of permanent magnets to store and
      rig onboard a moving metallic vessel. The present invention saves
      storage space and reduces vessel weight. Third, since the hook is
      only weakly magnetized, the tendency for the hooks to entangle and
      attach to other metal surfaces is greatly reduced. This makes
      handling magnetized metals on a metal vessel much easier than
      having a plurality of permanent magnets to contend with.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Finally, if a ferromagnetic fishing hook, such as a steel
      circle hook, is used, there is no significant additional expense
      to the fishermen to magnetize the hook other than their time. This
      eliminates the expense of purchasing permanent magnets to achieve
      the same effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The second component of the magnetoelectropositive hook
      incorporates the use of an electropositive metal on or within the
      hook material. The pure metal (ground state) form of Praseodymium,
      Neodymium, Cerium, Samarium, Ytterbium, or Magnesium metal is
      particularly effective at inducing aversive behavioral responses
      in juvenile sharks. For reasons not yet fully understood,
      elasmobranchs, particularly those of the order Carcharhiniformes,
      exhibit aversive behavior within a 0.2 meter range of these
      electropositive metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] We first observed the unusual repellent effects of
      Lanthanide metals on sharks when tonically-immobilized juvenile
      lemon sharks (N. brevirostris) exhibited violent rousing behavior
      in the presence of a 153 gram 99.95% Samarium metal ingot. As the
      Samarium metal was moved towards the immobilized shark, the shark
      terminated tonic immobility, in the direction away from the
      approaching metal. For experimental controls, pure Chromium, an
      antiferromagnetic metal, and pyrolytic graphite, a highly
      diamagnetic substance, failed to produce any behavioral responses
      in juvenile lemon sharks.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Next, a polystyrene white plastic blinder was used to
      remove any visual and motion cues from an approaching metal. This
      blinder was placed close to the shark's eye, sufficiently
      shielding its nares, eyes, gills, and head up to its pectoral fin.
      Again, Samarium metal terminated tonic immobility in all test
      subjects at a range of 2 to 50 cm from the blinder. Chromium metal
      and pyrolytic graphite did not produce any notable behavioral
      shifts.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In order to confirm that pressure waves were not affecting
      the test subjects, the tester's hand was moved underwater towards
      the shark's head both with and without blinders at varying speeds.
      This motion also did not disrupt the immobilized state.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The same series of experiments were repeated with juvenile
      nurse sharks (G. cirratum) and yielded the same behavioral
      results.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The same experimental protocol was repeated with a 73 gram
      ingot of 99.5% Gadolinium metal and yielded the same behavioral
      results in both juvenile lemon sharks and nurse sharks. It is
      noted that the rousing behavior was most violent when Samarium
      metal was used. Additionally, the Gadolinium metal corroded
      quickly after seawater exposure, and therefore would be
      appropriate for a one-time use application.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Next, in order to eliminate the possibility of galvanic
      cell effects, juvenile sharks were removed from their pens and
      brought at least 15 meters away from any submerged metal objects.
      All testers and witnesses removed watches, rings, and jewelry so
      that only the lanthanide metal was exposed to seawater. The same
      experimental method was repeated in lemon sharks and we report
      that tonic immobility was terminated with Samarium metal in all
      tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] We report that waving Samarium or Gadolinium in air above
      immobilized or resting sharks does not effect behavior, even when
      the metal is very close to the water's surface. The metal must be
      in contact with seawater in order to produce the repellent effect.
      This is notably different from the effects of a rare-earth magnet,
      which will often terminate tonic immobility at close range in air.
      It is thus proposed that any electropositive metal or alloy must
      be in contact with the seawater to produce the desired repellency
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The effects of lanthanide metal on free-swimming sharks
      were also evaluated. Two juvenile nurse sharks (less than 150 cm
      total length) were allowed to rest in an open-water captive pen.
      The tester approached the nurse sharks and moved his hand near the
      pen wall. His hand contained no metal. Both nurse sharks remained
      at rest. Next, the tester presented the 153 gram ingot of Samarium
      metal underwater to the pen wall and we note that both nurse
      sharks awakened and rapidly swam away from the tester's locale.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Next, a highly-stimulated competitively-feeding population
      of six blacknose sharks (C. acronotus) (total length up to 120 cm)
      and six Carribean reef sharks (C. perezii) (total length up to 210
      cm) was established using chum and fish meat. A diver entered the
      water near the population of sharks with the 153 gram of Samarium
      metal secured to one end of a 1.5 meter-long polyvinyl chloride
      pole. As free-swimming sharks swam close to the diver, the control
      end of the pole (without metal) was presented in a left-right
      waving motion. Approaching sharks would swim past, bump, or
      briefly bite the pole. The diver then turned the Samarium
      metal-end of the pole towards the approaching sharks. All
      blacknose sharks exhibited a "twitching" or "jerking" behavior as
      they came near the metal ingot and quickly swam away. Caribbean
      reef sharks generally avoided the metal, but did not exhibit the
      twitching behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Some pure Lanthanide metals are extremely reactive to air
      and water, and therefore are not particularly well-suited for long
      time use in the marine environment. For example, pure Europium
      metal has been observed to appreciably oxidize in air in a matter
      of hours and degrades quickly in moist air. Other metals, such as
      Erbium and Samarium have a much higher resistance to oxidation in
      air and slowly react with cold seawater. Other reactive pure
      Lanthanide metals are acceptable for one-time use as long as they
      are kept protected prior to use.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Mixtures and alloys containing Lanthanide metals may serve
      as an economical alternative to pure Lanthanide metals. In
      particular, Cerium Misch metal, Lanthanum Misch metal,
      Neodymium-Praseodymium Misch metal and Samarium-Cobalt (SmCo)
      mixtures and alloys may be used in shark-repelling devices.<br>

      [0054] It is not yet fully understood why sharks are responding to
      Lanthanide metals. It would seem that some type of detection is
      occurring in the Ampullae of Lorenzini organ, but how electrical
      currents are being generated and detected with a solitary rare
      earth metal in seawater is not known at this time. We hypothesized
      that a magnetic or electrical field was being induced by the
      metal's movement through seawater. We attempted to measure minute
      magnetic fields being produced by the movement of Samarium metal
      through seawater in a closed system. A submersible calibrated
      milliGauss meter probe was secured in a plastic tank containing
      seawater with the same salinity, pH, and temperature of the water
      used in previous shark testing. After zeroing out the Earth's
      magnetic field, we did not detect any magnetic fields being
      produced by the movement of Samarium metal through the tank,
      within tenths of a milliGauss. Because there appears to be a lack
      of a magnetic field component, there cannot be an electrical field
      component. This is a difficult concept because the sharks are
      responding, at most times violently, only when the metal is in
      contact with seawater. The same phenomenon occurs when the sharks
      are far-removed from any other pure metals or alloys in seawater.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The effect is not limiting to the order of the shark, as
      both nurse sharks (Orectolobiformes) and lemon sharks
      (Carcarhiniformes) responded in a similar manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Another hypothesis is that water-soluble salts are being
      formed and driven towards the shark as the metal is moved through
      seawater. The shark, in turn, may be hypersensitive to the
      presence of rare-earth compounds or ions. The use of our blinder
      during the experiments should have steered any water containing
      rare earth salts around the shark's nose and mouth, limiting
      exposure, but the response was equal with or without blinders. In
      one test, an immobilized shark was moved towards a stationary
      Samarium ingot. The shark exhibited bending away from the ingot
      prior to terminating immobility. This movement would have pushed
      metal salts away from the shark.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Further experiments using solutions of the nitrates and
      chlorides of the early-Lanthanide metals showed no behavioral
      shifts (using seawater controls) when presented to immobilized
      sharks at doses up to 25 mL to the nares.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Captive Cobia, which are commercially valuable marine fish,
      were exposed to Lanthanide metals during feeding trials. We report
      that exposure to Holmium, Gadolinium, Dysprosium, and Samarium
      ingots did not disrupt normal feeding behavior. Cobia do not
      possess the Ampullae of Lorenzini organ found in sharks.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] A close correlation was found between the revised Pauling
      electronegativity values for these metals, and behavioral
      response. As the revised Pauling electronegativity decreased, the
      violence of the response seemed to increase. A repellency
      threshold was found at an electronegativity of 1.3 or less-Metals
      with electronegativities greater than 1.3 did not produce the
      response. Highly reactive metals, such as Strontium and Calcium
      (electronegativities of 0.89 and 1.00 respectively) produced a
      rousing reaction as expected.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0060] The present invention combines the repellent effects of
      ferromagnetism along with electropositivity to offer two shark
      repellents within a standard metal fishing hook. In one embodiment
      of the invention, an electropositive metal is incorporated onto
      the hook by wrapping a ribbon, foil, or sheet of the metal around
      a portion, portions, or the entire magnetized hook. In another
      embodiment of the invention, a coating of electropositive metal is
      deposited onto a portion, portions, or the entire magnetized
      exterior hook surface through sputtering, thermal evaporation,
      thick-film deposition, or chemical vapor deposition techniques. In
      a third non-limiting embodiment of the invention, an
      electropositive metal or an alloy of electropositive metals is
      combined with gallium metal to produce a low-melting point alloy.
      The gallium-electropositive metal alloy is warmed to its melting
      point and applied to a portion, portions, or the entire surface of
      a cleaned and magnetized hook. Upon cooling, an electropositive
      coating remains at the application site of the magnetized hook. In
      yet another non-limiting embodiment of the invention, a hook is
      made directly from a ferromagnetic alloy that also contains one or
      more electropositive metals. This alloy would ideally have a
      mechanical strength and machinability comparable to standard
      fishing hooks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0061] The present invention finds use in commercial fisheries
      where unintentional shark by-catch is a problem. The use of
      magneto-electropositive fishing hooks reduces the number of sharks
      captured on hook and therefore makes these hooks available for
      target fish. The magneto-electropositive hook is particularly
      useful in tuna and swordfish fisheries.<br>

      [0001] This invention relates generally to elasmobranch
      repellents, methods of making and using such repellents and
      devices for administering such repellents. This invention also
      relates to a process for selecting elasmobranch carcasses and
      using polar solvents to extract semiochemicals that induce a
      flight reaction in elasmobranchs. Qualitative techniques are
      described, which allow for detection of the production of
      semiochemicals during the extraction process. Without being
      limited to a specific theory, it is believed that extracted
      semiochemicals are detected in elasmobranchs by olfaction because
      behavioral responses are achieved with very low concentrations of

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Shark attacks on humans have been recorded from ancient
      times. One such attack on an unlucky Mediterranean sponge diver is
      recorded from the third century B.C. (Thomas B. Allen, Shark
      Attacks: Their causes and avoidance 35 (2001)). And since the
      early part of the twentieth century, the populace of the United
      States has been riveted by sporadic stories of sensational and
      gruesome human encounters with sharks. As the twentieth century
      progressed and America's love for the seashore grew, so did its
      fascination with the remote but real possibility of a dangerous
      brush with one of these creatures. From at least 1916, shoreline
      municipalities began to develop physical structures to keep public
      bathing areas safe from the perceived danger of sharks. And
      through the present day, reports of shark attacks have frightened
      coastal communities and negatively impacted their economies as
      seashore revelers curtailed their beach excursions with each new
      and ever frightening story of voracious sharks in a particular
      town's waters.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] As the number of humans spending time in the ocean has
      increased, so has the number of shark attacks and along with that
      increase in attacks so grows the urgent need for a repellent.
      Further, as the twenty-four hour news cycle continues its frenetic
      discussion of the threat of sharks to humans, each shark attack in
      the developed world appears to be reported with greater sensation
      and grander desperation. As such, the ever-pressing need to
      develop an effective shark repellent is even greater than before
      as the public seeks to provide itself some assurance that it will
      not be a victim of the next injurious encounter with a shark.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] While fear of attack by sharks seems to have appeared in
      the United States in the early part of the twentieth century, the
      Second World War particularly amplified this fear when U.S.
      service personnel were called to combat in the dangerous and
      "shark infested" South Pacific. During that time, the U.S. Navy
      began a concerted effort to develop a chemical shark repellent to
      protect sailors and air personnel exposed to sharks when downed in
      shark-prone waters. Since then, government and private industry
      have worked to discover and develop a chemical shark repellent
      potent enough to protect humans. (Johnson and Baldridge (1985).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] To establish clear criteria for government development of
      an effective chemical shark repellent, Johnson and Baldridge set
      forth a goal in 1985 of finding a chemical that would repel sharks
      in ocean water at 1 part per billion. While the goal was a good
      one, no previously-developed chemical repellent has even come
      close to achieving the standard.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] An effective repellent would not only provide some
      assurance to humans bathing or adrift in waters frequented by
      sharks, an effective repellent would also significantly help the
      commercial fishing industry. Commercial longline fishing
      operations routinely target swordfish and tuna. However, the
      longline fishing hook is not selective, and it is not uncommon for
      more sharks to be caught than swordfish or tuna. Sharks that are
      caught as unintended targets are commonly called "by-catch."
      Often, the shark dies on the hook prior to retrieval. If a live
      shark is cut free during retrieval, the hook, snood and gangion
      are usually lost. This presents significant monetary loss as well
      as significant inadvertent death for millions of sharks. There has
      been a long-felt need to reduce by-catch losses in the fishing
      industry and to save the lives of many millions of sharks each
      year. Currently, as many as 80 species of shark are considered
      threatened with extinction and it is estimated that up to 100
      million sharks are killed each year by humans. It is no surprise,
      then, that an effective repellent would satisfy a long-felt need
      in the commercial fishing industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] It has been recognized for some time that development of a
      repellent effective against two particular orders of shark,
      Carcharhinoforme and Lamniformes, would provide considerable
      protection to humans and considerable assistance to commercial
      fishing. This is because nearly all of the known aggressive
      species of sharks and the predominant kinds of sharks that also
      interfere with commercial fishing are from those two orders.
      Orders Squaliformes and Orectolobiformes, on the other hand,
      represent sharks that have caused relatively few injuries
      throughout history and do not commonly harm commercial fishing
      interests.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Sharks and their close relatives, rays and skates, are
      classified in biological taxonomy within the class Chondrichthyes
      (fish) and the sub-class Elasmobranchii (fish without bones).
      Within the sub-class Elasmobranchii, sharks are classified in the
      sub-class Selachii, and rays and skates are classified within the
      sub-class Batoidei.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Of the more than 350 known species of shark, as many as 35
      species have been recorded attacking humans. Repeated attacks,
      however, have been recorded with less than 15 of these species.
      The frequency of shark attacks worldwide is quite small compared
      to the number of humans who work and play in the ocean each day.
      Less than about 100 humans are attacked by sharks each year with
      fatalities from shark attack averaging around 30. Nevertheless,
      the real fact of shark attack and the constant possibility, though
      low probability, of shark attack makes the need for an effective
      shark repellent a pressing reality for millions of ocean-going
      people every day.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] While fatal shark attacks have most likely occurred for
      millennia, recorded events have been rare until the twentieth
      century. One early recorded fatal shark attack occurred in 1580
      when a man overboard on a Portuguese sailing vessel was reportedly
      "torn to pieces" while clinging to a life buoy. (Allen (2001) at
      33). This was certainly not the earliest recorded shark attack. In
      fact, the danger of shark attacks on sponge divers in the
      Mediterranean was documented in the Natural History of Pliny the
      Elder in 77 A.D. and the above-noted fatal story of a sponge diver
      who lost part of his lower body to a shark was recorded in the
      third century B.C. (Allen (2001) at 35). Many shark attacks have
      been recorded ever since. There appears, however, to have been no
      consideration of methods of limiting shark attacks (at least in
      the United States) until 1916.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The summer of 1916 ushered in "the year of the shark" for
      the coastal regions around New York City. Over just 12 days in
      that summer, at least four people were killed by sharks along the
      New Jersey coastline. (Allen (2003) at 174). These attacks later
      inspired the movie Jaws (1975). (Thomas B. Allen, The Shark
      Almanac 174 (2003)). Beginning in 1916, the American public
      embraced a collective and long-enduring fear of sharks. This fear
      swelled to a point of concern for the U.S. government when it
      entered World War II against Japan in the South Pacific. (Allen
      (2001) at 207). To maintain morale among sailors and airmen (and
      their families) who faced the constant possibility of finding
      themselves adrift and exposed at sea, the U.S. government began
      research directed at protecting service personnel from shark
      attack. (Allen (2001) at 207). In this effort, the U.S. Navy began
      a program to develop a chemical shark repellent. The resulting
      product was known as "Shark Chaser."<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In Chapter 17 of Dr. Perry W. Gilbert's 1975 printing of
      "Sharks and Survival", Richard L. Tuve of the U.S. Naval Research
      Laboratory describes the development of the U.S. Navy "Shark
      Chaser" chemical shark repellent. The program originated with the
      Office of Strategic Services in March 1942. Initial research was
      based on anecdotal evidence; Floridian fishermen contended that if
      a shark died on an unattended hook and line, further fishing in
      that area became undesirable. The researchers, therefore,
      hypothesized that some substance emitted by the decomposing body
      drove other sharks away from the vicinity.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] As research continued, Woods Hole investigators and U.S.
      Navy scientists determined (erroneously it turns out) that the
      principal chemical material exuding from the decomposing shark was
      ammonium acetate. Scientists at Wood Hole also proposed the use of
      copper, which was known to reduce feeding in captive fishes and
      sharks. The ultimate combination of ammonium acetate and copper
      produced copper acetate, which was combined with nigrosine dye to
      provide a visual indication of the repellent dispersion.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The dye and copper acetate combination was molded into
      cakes and field testing began in 1944. Following a series of
      successful tests, a readjustment to 20% copper acetate and 80%
      nigrosine dye cake was sold as the "Shark Chaser." The military
      specifications for "Shark Chaser" were given under MIL-S-2785A as
      of Feb. 2, 1961.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] As the Shark Chaser repellent found widespread use,
      continued research revealed that copper acetate was not effective
      in repelling sharks. In Chapter 2 of Bernard J. Zahuranec's 1983
      printing of "Shark Repellents from the Sea: New Perspectives" the
      author gives insight into the inefficacy of the Shark Chaser. From
      tests in the shark pens at Bimini, Bahamas, Gilbert and Springer
      (1963) concluded that copper acetate fails to repel or inhibit the
      feeding activities of several species of sharks we have worked
      with at Bimini. Tester (1963) also reported the inefficacy of
      copper acetate against tiger sharks and other fish. Some theorized
      that the nigrosine dye itself was actually a visual deterrent. It
      was eventually concluded that copper acetate was not a practical
      deterrent for human use, and the military ultimately halted the
      issuance of the Shark Chaser. Recent research by the present
      inventors has confirmed these earlier findings that copper acetate
      is ineffective as a shark repellent and that ammonium acetate is
      not a principal component of decomposing shark tissue. See Tables
      2 and 4 and FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] While copper acetate was abandoned by the U.S. government
      in the 1960s, shark repellent research continued in the United
      States, with focus on marine organisms as sources of a repellent.
      Holothurins, anemones, urchins, and gorgonians were explored for a
      potential toxin but no shark repellent activity was detected. More
      research has been conducted on other naturally-occurring
      compounds. The inventors report that holotoxin from macerated sea
      apples, as well as seven types of potent hemolytic glycosides
      (saponins) from plants, were not effective as shark repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Over the last 50 years antishark measures employed to
      protect humans from shark have included electrical repellent
      devices (Gilbert &amp; Springer 1963, Gilbert &amp; Gilbert 1973),
      acoustical playbacks (Myrberg et al. 1978, Klimley &amp; Myrberg
      1979), visual devices (Doak 1974) and chemical repellents (Tuve
      1963, Clark 1974, Gruber &amp; Zlotkin 1982). None of these
      procedures proved totally effective in preventing shark attacks.
      (Sisneros (2001)).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Following World War II, when reports of Shark Chaser's
      ineffectiveness began to appear, the Office of Naval Research
      began to reconsider the matter of chemical shark repellents and
      renewed the screening and testing of possible candidates
      (Zahuranec &amp; Baldridge 1983). Hundreds of chemical substances
      were tested on sharks in an effort to find a chemical that would
      produce a quick and effective repellent response (Springer 1954,
      Gilbert &amp; Springer 1963, Tester 1963). These chemicals
      included powerful toxins that could (and did) kill a shark after
      brief exposure; but none elicited the desired repellent response.
      Support for the research eventually ended after many attempts had
      provided no effective shark repellent. (Sisneros (2001)).<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0019] As described in the ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1974, ichthyologist Eugenie Clark noticed that the delicate
      Moses Sole (Pardachirus marmoratus) was easy to catch and appeared
      to secrete a milky, astringent substance from the base of its
      dorsal and anal fin spines. Suspecting that the little fish was
      protected by a toxin of some kind, Clark collected several
      specimens for study. She found that the Moses Sole did indeed
      secrete a toxin she named "pardaxin," which caused red blood cells
      to rupture and-most intriguingly-repelled sharks. Tests by Clark
      in the laboratory and open sea revealed that at least four species
      of sharks were repelled by pardaxin for 10 hours or longer.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] While fresh pardaxin repelled sharks, it presented serious
      stability problems because it was not stable for room temperature
      storage, and was heat-sensitive. Pardaxin could be freeze-dried,
      but this form was only 30% as effective as the fresh secretion, as
      reported by Zlotkin (1976). Chemical analysis yielded that
      pardaxin was an acid protein of 162 amino acids with a MW of
      17,000 Daltons. The acid protein had a difficult synthesis pathway
      making commercial production not commercially practical.
      Sigma-Aldrich currently offers pardaxin for sale in the U.S. at
      $487.00 US for 1 milligram (product #P0435-1MG). Similar compounds
      such as mosesin and pavoninin present the same difficulties. There
      has been and remains a long-felt need for a shark repellent that
      can be produced and stored at room temperature with high yields of
      repellent. Further, it is believed that pardaxin, mosesin, and
      pavoninin act on the shark's respiratory system, requiring a
      minimum concentration of repellent to enter the mouth and contact
      the gill rakes of the shark, i.e., repellent had to be squirted
      directly into the shark's mouth.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Zlotkin noted that pardaxin possessed surfactant
      properties, reducing surface tension by as much as 60%. As
      described at the ReefQuest Centre for Shark Research:<br>
      <br>
      Zlotkin teamed with shark biologist Samuel Gruber to test a hunch:
      could commercially available soaps repel sharks? Zlotkin and
      Gruber tested two inexpensive commercial soap components, sodium
      and lithium lauryl sulfate (SLS and LLS, respectively-SLS,
      incidentally, is a common ingredient in shampoos), on young Lemon
      Sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). They found that both compounds
      were even more effective than pardaxin at repelling captive Lemon
      Sharks.<br>
      <br>
      Further tests by Nelson et al. found that SLS was an effective
      repellent against blue sharks and even great white sharks. As
      described in "The Behavior and Sensory Biology of Elasmobranch
      Fishes: An Anthology in Memory of Donald Richard Nelson" (Tricas,
      T. C. &amp; S. H. Gruber (ed.) (2001)), as well as "Surfactants as
      chemical shark repellents: past, present, and future" (J. A.
      Sisneros (2000))," the greatest limitation of SLS is that it is
      required to be squirted into the mouth of an approaching shark. It
      is not effective in surrounding-cloud-mode dispersions. Therefore,
      SLS is only useful when the user can clearly see an approaching
      shark and orchestrate the delivery of SLS into the animal's mouth.
      There has been a long-felt need for a repellent administered in
      surrounding cloud dispersions, thereby avoiding the impracticable
      need for direct-oral delivery.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In 2001, Sisneros reported further research on compounds
      related to pardaxin. Sisneros confirmed that dodecyl sulfate was
      the most effective surfactant shark repellent available at the
      time and that even the best repellent did not meet the Navy's
      potency requirement for a nondirectional surrounding-cloud type
      repellent of 100 parts per billion (0.1 ppm or 100
      micrograms/Liter). Sisneros further concluded that dodecyl sulfate
      would only be practical as a directional repellent such as in a
      squirt application. Sisneros suggested that future research should
      test the action of alkyl sulfates on cell membranes, the potential
      of other biotoxic agents, and semiochemicals in the search for an
      effective chemical shark repellent. (Id.)<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The existence of semiochemical repellents were first
      considered by Rasmussen &amp; Schmidt in 1992. They suggested that
      sharks may be chemically aware of the presence of potential danger
      by sensing the bodily secretions from potential predators.
      Rasmussen &amp; Schmidt hypothesized that lemon sharks, especially
      juveniles, inherently recognize chemical exudates produced by the
      American crocodile, Crocodylus acutus, a known predator of sharks.
      The concentrations needed to produce aversive responses in lemon
      sharks ranged from 10-7 to 10-9 M, which was near the functional
      limit of shark chemoreceptors (Hodgson &amp; Mathewson 1978).<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Sisneros also noted that another proposed potential source
      for shark repellent semiochemicals might perhaps be found in
      decomposing shark flesh (Baldridge 1990, Rasmussen &amp; Schmidt
      1992) because anecdotal information from fishermen claimed that
      sharks avoid areas containing decomposing carcasses of previously
      caught dead sharks. Sisneros postulated that perhaps there are
      semiochemicals found in extremely low concentrations in decaying
      shark flesh that act as alarm pheromones and provide warning
      signals to nearby sharks. None of those postulated compounds were
      known or have since been found and there have been no commercially
      available effective chemical shark repellents. As such, the long
      felt need for an effective repellent had not been satisfied until
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,490,360 and 4,340,587 describe the use of
      lucibufagins from fireflies and extractions of fireflies as a
      shark repellent. While the specifications suggest that behavioral
      changes were occurring in numerous species of animals, no effects
      were observed on larger inshore and pelagic sharks. Further, while
      one specification describes the "very extensive practical use in
      protecting bathing zones from the invasion of objectionable sea
      life such as sharks," the Atlantic Sharpnose species represents a
      very small-sized inshore species which has no reported
      aggressiveness nor represents a bycatch problem. Additionally, no
      practical synthesis is described for lucibufagins, therefore
      tremendous quantities of fireflies are required to produce
      drum-quantities of a repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Data on the use of firefly-derived repellents were also
      reported against the Atlantic Sharpnosed Shark (Rhizoprinodon
      terraenovae), the smooth dogfish (Mustelus canis), the pinfish
      (Lagadon rhomboides), and killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) in a
      paper presented at a symposium in 1981. (Bonaventura et al.,
      Problems and Possibilities: The Development of an Effective Shark
      Repellent for Naturally Occurring Biologically Active Substances,
      Jan. 5, 1981, Annual Meeting of the American Association for the
      Advancement of Science, Toronto, Canada). These data additionally
      provide no support for a repellent of inshore and pelagic sharks
      that would be useful as an effective shark repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] U.S. Pat. No. 6,606,963 describes an acoustical system
      which produces shark-repelling waveforms. This invention affects
      the shark's hearing and lateral line sensory systems. However, as
      described by Klimley, Myrberg et al., sharks rapidly habituate to
      a sound source unless output power is very high. The present
      invention overcomes these limitations by, in theory, affecting the
      olfactory system. There has been a long-felt need for a repellent
      that is effective such that competitively feeding populations of
      sharks will stop feeding and will avoid all food stimuli in the
      presence of the repellent, wherein no habituation is observed
      after exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Researchers have historically used several bio-assays to
      determine if a repellent evokes a flight response in shark. One
      such bio-assay introduces repellent of a certain concentration and
      volume to a position in a tank and measures avoidance in sharks of
      that portion of a tank or other aversive swimming behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Another such bio-assay introduces repellent of a certain
      concentration and volume into the feeding zone of sharks and
      measures whether sharks flee the feeding zone and/or cease feeding
      behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Another preliminary bio-assay measures the effect of a
      repellent on a shark that is immobilized in "tonic immobility."
      Tonic immobility is a state of paralysis that typically occurs
      when a shark is subject to inversion of its body along the
      longitudinal axis. This state is called "tonic," and the shark can
      remain in this state for up to 15 minutes thereby allowing
      researchers to observe effects of chemical repellents. After
      behavioral controls are established, an effective chemical
      repellent will awaken a shark from a tonic state. Researches can
      quantify dose sizes, concentrations, and time to awaken from these
      studies. A microliter autopipettor is used to observe effects at
      the 10-100 uL level. A 60 cc syringe is used as a baseline,
      looking for a preliminary response.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Another bioassay is known as the Johnson-Baldridge test.
      The test is defined as the delivery of 100 mg of chemical
      repellent into a 6 cubic meter boundary of water over a 3.5 hour
      period under steady-state conditions. This level of repellent
      delivery from a point source is considered to represent a
      concentration of 0.1 ppm. This is a proposed criterion in the art
      for an "effective" repellent. If sharks demonstrate aversive
      behavior under these conditions, then the criteria is satisfied.
      The inventors have designed and constructed an experiment to test
      if semiochemicals meet the Johnson-Baldridge criteria. A PVC
      tripod was situated in the ocean. The tripod supported a
      peristaltic metering pump, set to meter out exactly 100 mL of
      repellent per hour. The tripod also supported a video camera and
      transmitter, which observed the area under the tripod, marked off
      for 6 cubic meters and compensated for tidal changes. The video
      was monitored and recorded on shore. A fish head was secured under
      the tripod, within view of the camera. Once a population of sharks
      was established near the tripod, a control was performed. A second
      fish head was secured, the pump was started, and behavior was
      observed. If the fish head was protected for the 3.5 hour period,
      the criteria were met.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] Applicants have discovered an effective elasmobranch
      repellent. According to a non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, a repellent is provided comprising a semiochemical from
      a carcass of an elasmobranch. The inventive semiochemical
      terminated tonic immobility and evoked a flight response in an
      elasmobranch. It was also noticed that the inventive semiochemical
      did not evoke a flight response in fish having a bony skeleton. In
      another non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the
      repellent comprises a semiochemical and a polar solvent. In
      another non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the
      repellent comprises a carcass of an elasmobranch treated with a
      polar solvent for between about one month to about six months. In
      another non-limiting embodiment of the invention, the repellent is
      filtered from the polar solvent treated elasmobranch carcass. In
      another non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the
      repellent comprises a mixture of semiochemicals from more than one
      carcass of more than one elasmobranch species.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] According to a second embodiment of the present invention,
      a method of repelling an elasmobranch is provided comprising
      administering a semiochemical in the expected proximity of an
      elasmobranch. In another non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, the semiochemical is from an elasmobranch carcass
      treated with a polar solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] According to a third non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, a repellent is obtained by a process comprising the
      steps of exposing a carcass of an elasmobranch to a polar solvent,
      and filtering the repellent from the carcass. In another
      non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the repellent is
      obtained by a process wherein an elasmobranch carcass is
      aerobically decayed prior to exposure to a polar solvent and a
      portion or the entirety of the pre-treated carcass is then exposed
      to a polar solvent. In a non-limiting preferred embodiment, the
      elasmobranch carcass is aerobically decayed to a degree of
      decomposition between the onset of rigor mortis and the completion
      of putrefaction prior to exposure to the polar solvent. In another
      non-limiting preferred embodiment, the pre-treated carcass is
      completely immersed in a polar solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In a non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the
      inventive repellent is characterized on an HPLC chromatogram with
      three characteristic peaks with relative peaks detected in the
      range between approximately 240 nm to approximately 340 nm at
      about 5, about 6 and about 7 minutes and the relative peak at
      about 7 minutes is greater than the relative peaks at about 5
      minutes and about 6 minutes. In a preferred embodiment, the
      repellent HPLC chromatogram has the following characteristics<br>

      In a preferred non-limiting embodiment, the repellent has the
      following ultraviolet absorbances: 300 nm, greater than 1 AU; 312
      nm, greater than 2 AU; and 322 nm, greater than 2 AU.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] According to a fourth non-limiting embodiment of the
      present invention, a process for making an elasmobranch repellent
      is provided comprising the step of extracting a semiochemical from
      a carcass of an elasmobranch by exposing said carcass to a polar
      solvent and filtering said repellent from said carcass. In a
      preferred non-limiting embodiment, the method of manufacture of
      the inventive repellent comprises (1) placing a carcass of an
      elasmobranch in an extraction vessel, (2) exposing the carcass to
      aerobic decomposition, (3) treating said carcass and the
      decomposition fluids of said carcass with a polar solvent
      preferably in 50% water, 40% methanol, 6.5% ethanol, and 3.5%
      methyl isobutyl ketone, by weight, (4) monitoring for detectable
      semiochemicals, and (5) filtering the repellent from the carcass.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] According to a fifth non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, a compound for repelling elasmobranch is provided
      wherein the compound is characterized by a uv-visible spectrum
      having an absorbance peak between about 280 nm and about 340 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] According to a sixth non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, a specially designed container is provided for
      administering an elasmobranch repellent comprising a pressurized
      container and an actuator for release of the repellent when
      activated. In a preferred non-limiting embodiment, the container
      is an aerosol container comprises an actuator that triggers a
      continuous release of repellent when activated. In another
      non-limiting preferred embodiment, the aerosol container is
      weighted in the vicinity of the actuator to provide an erratic
      motion in the water when the container is administered, the
      actuator is activated and the repellent is discharged from the
      container.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] According to a seventh non-limiting embodiment of the
      present invention, a method of repelling an elasmobranch is
      provided comprising administering a semiochemical from a raft,
      buoy or piling in the expected vicinity of an elasmobranch. In a
      preferred non-limiting embodiment of the present invention, the
      semiochemical is administered from the raft, buoy or piling from a
      pressurized diptube that discharges the semiochemical above the
      surface of the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] According to an eighth non-limiting embodiment of the
      invention, a method of repelling an elasmobranch is provided
      comprising attaching to a fishing longline a mass of carcass of an
      elasmobranch that has been treated with polar solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] According to a ninth non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, a kit is provided comprising a semiochemical repellent
      and a vehicle for administering the semiochemical repellent. Such
      vehicle of administration may include known devices and novel
      devices disclosed herein.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0079] "Acoustical stimulation" is the arousal or activation
      of a subject related to sound or sense of hearing. Elasmobranchs
      are attracted to low-frequency pulsed sounds, similar to those
      emitted by wounded prey. Acoustical stimulation of a subject is
      generally accomplished by the pulsing of sound waves in the
      frequency of 25 to 100 Hz. Some elasmobranchs are attracted to
      sound sources from distances as great as 250 m.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] "Canister" is a large or small container or vessel of any
      shape. An "aerosol canister" is a large or small container or
      vessel of any shape the contents of which are held under pressure
      and may contain a propellant gas or material to discharge a
      desired substance in a spray, liquid, foam or mist.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] "Carcass" is the dead body of an animal or any portion
      thereof. For use in this application and unless otherwise
      indicated, a carcass refers to the dead body of an elasmobranch
      whole or in part and cleaned or uncleaned of stomach contents.
      Carcass may include the head, tail and/or muscle tissue.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] "Complete putrefaction" is the degree of decomposition
      where muscular tissue has substantially liquefied. Typically, the
      muscular tissue falls away, as a slime, from the skin, not
      retaining any shape. This period roughly coincides with the "black
      putrefaction" or "butyric putrefaction" periods of mammalian
      decay, approximately 20-50 days after death.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] "Conspecific" means of the same species.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] "Conspecific repellents" are repellents that are made from
      a species of elasmobranch that repels the same species or family
      or order of elasmobranch.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] "Elasmobranchii" represents the subclass of class
      Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish), which includes the sharks and
      rays. In this specification, "elasmobranchs" represent the
      super-orders and orders of elasmobranchs that are of interest for
      producing a repellent based on availability and conservation, and
      also those that present a potential threat to humans or represent
      a bycatch problem in commercial fisheries. As such,
      "elasmobranchs" in this specification means one or more
      elasmobranchii in the super-orders Galeomorphii and Squalomorphii
      and orders Squaliforms (dogfish), Carcharhiniformes (requiem
      sharks), Lamniformes (mackerel sharks), and Orectolobiformes
      (carpet sharks).<br>
      <br>
      [0086] "Feeding zone" is the area in which sharks have been
      stimulated and demonstrate aggressive feeding behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] "Heterospecific" means from a different species.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] "Heterospecific repellents" are repellents that are from a
      species of elasmobranchs that repels a different species or family
      or order of elasmobranch.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] "Polar solvent" is a first substance capable of dissolving
      another substance wherein the first substance comprises molecules
      with electric charges unequally distributed, leaving one end of
      each molecule more positive than the other.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] "Putrefaction" is the degree of decomposition at which most
      of a carcass is decomposed.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] "Rigor mortis" is the degree of decomposition at which a
      carcass becomes stiff.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] "Semiochemical" is a compound or mixture of compounds
      derived from the carcass of an elasmobranch that can terminate
      tonic immobility of an elasmobranch with a dosage of less than 500
      microliters, that can evoke a flight reaction in an elasmobranch
      that has been stimulated to feed and that does not evoke a flight
      response in telios fish.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] "Tonic immobility" is the state of paralysis that typically
      occurs when an elasmobranch is subject to inversion of its body
      along the longitudinal axis of the body, i.e., is belly up. The
      elasmobranch can remain in this state for up to 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. SEMIOCHEMICAL EXTRACTION PROCESS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0094] Semiochemical repellents in accordance with the present
      invention are prepared from an elasmobranch carcass as illustrated
      in FIG. 1A. An elasmobranch carcass is collected (whole or in
      part). The carcass or carcasses are aerobically decayed preferably
      beyond the degree of decomposition of rigor mortis but before
      complete putrefaction. Some semiochemical compounds are eluted
      during the controlled aerobic decay.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The elasmobranch carcass can be of a single variety or of
      multiple varieties of elasmobranch and may represent whole
      carcasses or a part or parts of different carcasses. The carcass
      sample preferably contains at least a portion of muscle tissue. A
      whole carcass, dressed tube of carcass, steak of carcass or
      section or sections of carcass may be used, cleaned or uncleaned
      of entrails or stomach contents.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The carcass sample is allowed to aerobically decay beyond
      rigor mortis but before putrefaction, which period of time may be
      from about one day to about one month. The aerobically decayed
      tissue is transferred to a bath of polar solvent, preferably along
      with any semiochemicals that may have been released. The decayed
      tissue is kept in a bath of polar solvent in an extraction vessel
      for from about 1 week to about 6 months and up to about one year.
      The polar-solvent-carcass vessel contents are sampled from time to
      time to determine the stage of extraction of semiochemical(s).
      When the presence of semiochemicals is detectable at a determined
      end-point, the contents of the extraction tank may be filtered for
      use as an elasmobranch repellent or the pre-filtered contents may
      be formed into a mass for use as an elasmobranch repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] A preferred extraction process is described in FIGS. 1A-1B.
      For example, muscular tissue from one or more sharks of the Order
      of Carcharihiniform, Orectobolobiform, Lamniform or Squaliform are
      obtained and allowed to aerobically decay in an environment free
      from insects and other flesh eating organisms (1). In a preferred
      embodiment, the shark tissue is aerobically decayed in an
      extraction vessel of polypropylene, high density polyethylene
      (HDPE) or glass for about ten days (2). Polar solvent is then
      introduced to the extraction vessel of sufficient volume to cover
      the decayed shark tissue (3). After an amount of time, preferably
      one month, the extraction is sampled for instrumental analysis to
      determine whether or not semiochemicals have begun to be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] If semiochemical production is not yet sufficient to
      achieve a desired end-point (as set forth in this specification by
      standard signatures on analytical instruments or by a
      demonstration by testing the repellent activity against a shark),
      the extraction process is allowed to proceed for another period of
      time. The following period of time for further incubation of the
      extraction may be any amount of time, ordinarily less than about
      six months. Preferably, the waiting period is from about 1 day to
      about one month, depending on the expected production time for
      semiochemicals from the particular shark tissue in the particular
      polar solvent. The skilled artisan will easily determine optimal
      waiting periods between instrumental analyses of the extraction.
      The waiting period and instrumental analysis should be repeated
      until there has been sufficient production of semiochemicals to
      achieve a desired end-point. The desired end-point is chosen by
      detection of sufficient semiochemicals using instrumental analysis
      or by the demonstration of a flight reaction in shark when applied
      to the shark's environment. Semiochemical repellent may be
      recovered at various stages (2A, 3A, 4A) in the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] When the extraction process has produced sufficient
      semiochemicals to achieve a desired end-point, the contents of the
      extraction vessel is preferably filtered (4). The filtrate is
      containerized and prepared for administration as an elasmobranch
      repellent (5). The methods of the present invention are able to
      produce more than 15 liters of repellent solution from a 2.2 kg
      shark specimen. A 6-foot carcass is able to produce approximately
      50 gallons of repellent solution according to the extraction
      process described in the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] When semiochemicals in sufficient abundance are detected,
      the decay process may likewise be halted by lowering temperature
      or immersion in solvents for preservation until use. In an
      alternative, once semiochemicals in sufficient abundance are
      detected the contents of the extraction vessel is formed into a
      mass or masses for administration as an elasmobranch repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In the extraction process, whole carcasses are preferable
      over sectioned carcasses. In lieu of an entire carcass, successful
      semiochemical repellents have been prepared using the entire head,
      the entire tail, or the liver from a specimen. Blood alone is not
      preferred for semiochemical derivation<br>
      <br>
      [0102] At the outset, carcasses should be allowed to decay
      aerobically, past the stage of rigor mortis, but before complete
      putrefaction. This may be accomplished by leaving the carcass in
      open air or a cooler for a period of time, taking care to not
      allow insects and scavengers to manifest. Decomposition fluids are
      preferably retained. A freshly killed carcass is unsuitable for
      deriving semiochemicals because specific catabolites have not yet
      been produced. A fully decayed carcass is unsuitable for deriving
      semiochemicals because specific catabolites are fully depleted or
      metabolized. Anaerobic decay is an unacceptable method, and
      produces high yields of organic sulfur compounds and low yields of
      semiochemicals.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Carcass selection may be made based on what species of
      elasmobranch are desired to be repelled. For example, it is not
      preferred to utilize stingray carcasses when trying to develop a
      hammerhead-specific repellent. It is preferred, however, to use a
      stingray carcass to develop a stingray repellent. Most genus
      Carcarhinus specimens are very suitable for preparing
      broad-spectrum shark repellents. It is demonstrated herein that
      lemon shark carcasses not only produced semiochemical solutions
      which repelled lemon sharks, but also repelled blacknose, reef,
      and bull sharks.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Carcasses from multiple species are also suitable. For
      example, a vessel containing two lemon shark carcasses, one nurse
      shark carcass, and one smooth dogfish carcass produced a high
      yield of semiochemicals after 6 months of extraction time.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] After the initial decay period and before total
      putrefaction, the decomposition fluids, blood, and the carcass
      mass are preferably placed in an extraction vessel. In a preferred
      embodiment, the carcass is not cleaned, gutted, or rinsed prior to
      transfer.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The extraction vessel is preferably a container which is
      impervious to organic solvents and acids, and which seals
      air-tight to prevent escape of solvent vapors. The vessel is
      ideally polypropylene plastic or glass. This vessel should possess
      access points for solvent addition, draining,
      circulation/stirring, and viewing.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The optimal positioning of the carcass in the vessel and
      solvent is with the carcass positioned vertically, head down, in
      the vessel. More than one carcass may be positioned in the vessel
      to increase yield.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] A solvent for the extraction process is any polar solvent
      that is less than 100% water. A preferred extraction solvent is a
      water:solvent mixture at a 50:50 mix ratio by weight of water to
      another polar solvent. The skilled extraction chemist will
      understand that adjustments may be made to improve yields. A
      preferred water to other polar solvent ratio is 50:50
      water:solvent, by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Any single, binary, ternary, or multiple solvent system is
      suitable for the 50:50 mixture. For example, n-propanol,
      iso-propanol, glycol ethers, methanol/ethanol systems, acetic
      acid, hydrochloric acid solutions, butanol, dimethylsulfoxide, and
      short-chain aldehydes and ketones are acceptable solvents. A
      preferred polar solvent is 80% methanol, 17% ethanol, and 3%
      methyl isobutyl ketone by weight. Water in combination with the
      aforementioned solvents is also suitable, as long as anaerobic
      decay is minimized. Leaving the carcass in pure water is not a
      preferred solvent system. It is preferred that the solvent cover
      the entire carcass mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The extraction process should be carried out at about room
      temperature. Elevated temperatures speed the extraction process,
      but produce lower-efficacy semiochemical solutions. Soxhlet
      extraction similarly produces low-efficacy semiochemical
      solutions. The most effective process is simply to leave the
      vessel at room temperature and slow circulation for 3 to 6 months,
      depending on the solvent strength.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The solvent should be sampled periodically to monitor the
      presence of semiochemicals and to determine a desired end-point
      for the extraction process. End-point may be determined with
      uv-visible spectrophotometry, high performance liquid
      chromatography (HPLC), mass-spectrometry, infrared detection,
      visible detection of a yellow color or testing of samples on shark
      to determine if a flight reaction is induced.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Spectrophotometry is a simple method for determining the
      "ripening" state of the solvent mixture. Over time, peak
      absorbances will be observed between about 290 nm and about 320
      nm, with some maxima being extremely strong when the extraction
      process is operating efficiently. When clear solvents are
      employed, the solvent/semiochemical mixture develops a
      characteristic pale-yellow coloration after 3 months, indicating
      the presence of the semiochemicals.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Preferred end-points for the extraction process as detected
      by different instrumental analyses are set forth in the following
      section.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] At the end of the extraction process, the semiochemical
      solution may be filtered, but not distilled. Rotary evaporation
      and fractional distillation has been observed to ruin the efficacy
      of the semiochemical solution. Fritted glass filters and micron
      filters are very suitable for removing skin and biomass particles,
      as well as improving visual clarity. Vacuum may be employed in the
      filtration process, but heat is not preferred. Preferably, the
      solution is used at full strength for maximum repellency on wild
      sharks and rays.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] A. Instrumental Analysis for Determining Desired End-Point
      of Extraction Process<br>
      <br>
      [0116] The end point of the extraction process may be determined
      by instrumental analysis. End-point is reached when a
      semiochemical has been produced in the extraction process to a
      point where it is detectable in sufficient amounts by instrumental
      analysis or where the extraction has developed to the point of
      evoking a flight response, evoking aversive swimming behavior,
      evoking termination of tonic immobility, or providing protection
      sufficient to satisfy the Johnson-Baldridge test in elasmobranchs.
      Liquid chromatography, spectrophotometry, gas chromatography and
      qualitative analytical techniques are preferably used to identify
      the point in time where semiochemical concentration reaches a
      maximum. Semiochemicals possess characteristic absorbance maxima,
      fragmentation, retention times, and physical properties, such as
      odor, color and pH.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] A desirable end-point may be determined by testing a
      filtered sample from the extraction vessel on HPLC according the
      following gradient elution configuration:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Column:&nbsp; Novapak 0.5u C18 reversed phase<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Flow rate:&nbsp; 0.5 ml/min<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Mobile phase:&nbsp; A: Methanol, 0.1% acetic acid<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: Water, 0.1% acetic acid<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Gradient:&nbsp; 0-10 minutes 100% A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10-12 minutes, 0% A, 100% B, linear<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12-20 minutes 100% B<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20-22 minutes 0% B, 100% A, linear<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22-60 minutes, 100% A<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Injection:&nbsp; 50 ul into a 50 ul loop<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Detection:&nbsp; 240 nm, range 1 AUFS<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; Column temperature:&nbsp; 25[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      In this setup, 6 characteristic compounds elute within the first 8
      minutes, producing 6 peaks. Of these characteristic peaks, 3 are
      of particular interest. A distinctive strong peak at about 7
      minutes and two moderate peaks at about 5 and about 6 minutes
      demonstrate well developed semiochemical extract. A second group
      of compounds elute after 23 minutes, indicating up to 25
      additional compounds, with weak to moderate absorbances.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] A desirable end-point may also be determined by testing a
      filtered sample of the extraction on HPLC after amines in the
      semiochemical repellent samples have been derivatized using
      ninhydrin to produce strong chromophores. Derivatization with
      ninhydrin yields two colored products, Rhuemann's purple at 570 nm
      for primary amines, and a colored product with an absorbance
      maximum at 440 nm for secondary amines. These colored products are
      detected using an HPLC and an ultraviolet-visible detector.
      Derivatization may be performed pre- or post-column, but
      post-column work must employ additional pumps, flow combiners, and
      elevated temperatures ahead of the detector. Preferably the
      derivatization is performed pre-column. Samples are prepared by
      combining 50% w/w of a 1% ninhydrin in 2-propanol solution with
      50% w/w of a semiochemical sample. Samples are allowed to
      derivatize for 2 hours at 40[deg.] C. prior to analysis. The
      following system configuration is used:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      &nbsp; Column:&nbsp; C18, reversed phase<br>
      &nbsp; Flow rate:&nbsp; 1 ml/min<br>
      &nbsp; Mobile phase:&nbsp; 80% water, 20% acetonitrile<br>
      &nbsp; Injection:&nbsp; 10 uL<br>
      &nbsp; Detection:&nbsp; 570 nm for primary amines,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 440 nm for secondary amines<br>
      &nbsp; Column temperature:&nbsp; 35[deg.] C.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      [0119] This method produces up to 5 characteristic peaks between 1
      and 2 minutes for primary amines at 570 nm. The method also
      produces up to 5 characteristic peaks between 1 and 2 minutes for
      secondary amines at 440 nm. An entity at both detection
      wavelengths is observed at 4.8 minutes with a trace concentration.
      If, in an alternative method of HPLC analysis, the gradient
      elution configuration set forth above is employed at 570 nm, three
      characteristic peaks of particular interest elute at around 5,
      around 6 and around 7 minutes, with the strongest peak at 7
      minutes. If the same gradient elution method is employed at 440
      nm, a characteristic broad double peak is expected to elute at
      around 30 to around 40 minutes preceded by about two minute by an
      earlier sharp peak.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] End-point may also be determined using uv spectral
      analysis. The ultraviolet spectra of an extracted semiochemical
      repellent solution may be considered to contain sufficient
      semiochemical products when they yield the following generally
      characteristic absorbances:<br>
      <br>
      240 nm, greater than 2 AU<br>
      266 nm, greater than 1 AU<br>
      273 nm, greater than 1 AU<br>
      280 nm, greater than 1.5 AU<br>
      289 nm, greater than 1.5 AU<br>
      294 nm, greater than 2 AU<br>
      300 nm, greater than 2.5 AU<br>
      312 nm, greater than 3 AU<br>
      322 nm, greater than 3 AU.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The visible spectrum of a semiochemical repellent solution
      yields a weak but likewise characteristic absorbance maximum in
      the red region, at 657 nm (less than 0.5 AU). A salient peak to
      determine sufficient development of semiochemicals using
      uv-visible spectrophotometry is often a signature peak beginning
      around 300 nm and reaching a maximum near 310 or 320 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] For example, semiochemical CL (from C. limbatus) was
      sampled at 0, 7, 21 and 40 days to determine development of
      semiochemical uv-vis signature. (See FIG. 11.) Signature
      absorbance at around 300 nm increased as extraction proceeded. A
      300 nm shoulder was barely perceptible at 0 days but increased
      throughout 7, 21 and 40 days of the extraction process to become a
      distinct peak at 40 days around 3.5 AU.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] B. Instrumental Analysis of Semiochemicals-Composition of
      Matter<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Semiochemical extractions may be qualitatively tested for
      the presence of sufficient semiochemicals to act as an
      elasmobranch repellent using a range of instrumental analytical
      techniques. These qualitative techniques include HPLC, uv-visible
      spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry coupled
      with other separation techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] 1. UV-Visible Spectrophotometry<br>
      <br>
      [0135] To test an extraction for sufficient presence or
      development of semiochemicals using uv-visible spectrophotometric
      analysis a uv-visible spectrophotometer may be employed. A
      dual-beam scanning spectrophotometer, such as the Perkin Elmer
      Lambda 12 model, is preferable. Neat semiochemical solutions
      should be micron-filtered and loaded into quartz cuvettes.
      Representative uncontaminated solvents used in the extraction
      process, at the same ratios used to perform the extraction, are
      used as a reference sample or "blank."<br>
      <br>
      [0136] An extracted semiochemical repellent solution may be
      considered to contain sufficient semiochemical products when its
      ultraviolet spectrum yields the following generally characteristic
      absorbances:<br>
      <br>
      240 nm, greater than 2 AU<br>
      266 nm, greater than 1 AU<br>
      273 nm, greater than 1 AU<br>
      280 nm, greater than 1.5 AU<br>
      289 nm, greater than 1.5 AU<br>
      294 nm, greater than 2 AU<br>
      300 nm, greater than 2.5 AU<br>
      312 nm, greater than 3 AU<br>
      322 nm, greater than 3 AU.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] The visible spectra of a semiochemical repellent solution
      yields a weak but characteristic absorbance maxima in the red
      region, at 657 nm, less than 0.5 AU.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] 2. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrophotometry<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrophotometry provides
      confirmation of certain functional groups in a semiochemical
      solution. Since the extraction solution contains water, another
      extraction must be performed to remove the semiochemicals from the
      water. FTIR cannot be accomplished in the presence of water. A
      simple extraction using a separatory funnel, with a 50:50 weight
      ratio mixture of a water-insoluble solvent to the semiochemical
      solution is very adequate. Strong water-insoluble solvents include
      diethyl ether, methylene chloride, and chloroform. The
      water-insoluble phase of this extraction may be further dried
      using magnesium or sodium sulfate, to remove all traces of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] In an FTIR analysis, a waterless sample from the
      water-insoluble phase described above is set on a KBr crystal. A
      scan from 1100 nm to 3500 nm of a semiochemical extraction may
      indicate the following groups:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      2800-3000&nbsp; nm&nbsp; Asymmetric and symmetric CH3 groups<br>
      1300-1400&nbsp; nm&nbsp; Scissor, asymmetric, and symmetric CH3
      groups<br>
      1126.00&nbsp; nm&nbsp; C-O bond stretching<br>
      1434.56&nbsp; nm&nbsp; C-O bond stretching<br>
      1637.28&nbsp; nm&nbsp; C-C bond stretching<br>
      2846.60&nbsp; nm&nbsp; C-H bond stretching<br>
      2916.50&nbsp; nm&nbsp; C-H bond stretching<br>
      2951.46&nbsp; nm&nbsp; C-H bond stretching<br>
      3321.94&nbsp; nm&nbsp; OH bond stretching, indicating alcohols
      along with the<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above three preceding stretches.<br>
      <br>
      (FIG. 16.)<br>
      [0150] 3. High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, HPLC<br>
      <br>
      [0151] High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, HPLC is also used to
      detect the presence of semiochemicals in the extraction solution.
      A gradient HPLC system shows the presence of semiochemicals in two
      groupings, according to the following method:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      &nbsp; Column:&nbsp; Novapak 0.5u C18 reversed phase<br>
      &nbsp; Flow rate:&nbsp; 0.5 ml/min<br>
      &nbsp; Mobile phase:&nbsp; A: Methanol, 0.1% acetic acid<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B: Water, 0.1% acetic acid<br>
      &nbsp; Gradient:&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-10 minutes 100% A<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10-12 minutes, 0% A, 100% B, linear<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12-20 minutes 100% B<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20-22 minutes 0% B, 100% A, linear<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22-60 minutes, 100% A<br>
      &nbsp; Injection:&nbsp; 50 ul into a 50 ul loop<br>
      &nbsp; Detection:&nbsp; 240 nm, range 1 AUFS<br>
      &nbsp; Column temperature:&nbsp; 25[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] In this setup, three particularly distinctive peaks may be
      observed within the first about 8 minutes with the peaks spaced
      about one minute apart. The strongest peak is generally the final
      peak of the three. Most often peaks elute at about 5 minutes,
      about 6 minutes and about 7 minutes with the peak at 7 minutes
      relatively stronger than the peaks at 5 and 6 minutes. A second
      group of compounds elute after 23 minutes, indicating up to 25
      additional compounds, with weak to moderate absorbances.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] In another analysis, components with absorbances at 622 and
      624 nm elute at approximately 1.21 minutes using the following
      configuration:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      &nbsp; Column:&nbsp; 0.5u C18 reversed phase<br>
      &nbsp; Flow rate:&nbsp; 1 ml/min<br>
      &nbsp; Mobile phase:&nbsp; 80% w/w water, 20% w/w acetonitrile<br>
      &nbsp; Injection:&nbsp; 50ul into a 50ul loop<br>
      &nbsp; Detection:&nbsp; 622-625 nm<br>
      &nbsp; Column temperature:&nbsp; 35[deg.] C.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      HPLC coupled to fluorescence is also used to detect amino acids in
      the semiochemical mixture. Amino acids were derivatized with an
      active ortho-pthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent, which is prepared by
      treating OPA with an excess of a thiol compound, namely
      2-mercaptoethanol, to form an OPA-2-mercaptoethanol adduct. This
      adduct reacts with primary amines to form fluorescent isoindoles,
      which are readily detected by a fluorescence detector post-column.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] HPLC resolution can be improved by deproteinization.
      Membrane-filtered semiochemical samples are treated with
      perchloric acid, and then neutralized with potassium hydroxide,
      producing insoluble potassium perchlorate. The neutralized sample
      is centrifuged for 15 minutes, and the supernatant is analyzed by
      HPLC. Deproteinized samples generally produce better peak
      resolution and symmetry.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] 4. Ninhydrin Derivatization<br>
      <br>
      [0156] The amine functions in semiochemical repellent samples can
      be derivatized using ninhydrin to produce strong chromophores.
      Ninhydrin is a selective oxidizing agent which causes oxidative
      decarboxylation of amino acids producing CO2, NH3, and an aldehyde
      with one less carbon atom than the parent amino acid. The reduced
      ninhydrin then reacts with the liberated ammonia to form
      Ruhemann's Purple, a complex which maximally absorbs light at 570
      nm. Secondary amines, e.g., Proline and 4-Hydroxyproline, react
      via a different path and form a yellow derivative with an optimal
      absorbance at 440 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Since the reaction with amines is highly specific and the
      absorption characteristics of the formed chromophores follow
      Beer's Law, reagents based on Ninhydrin have long been the most
      popular choice for detection and quantitation of amines and amino
      acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Ninhydrin reacts slowly at room temperature. Consequently,
      in automated amino acid analysis, elevated temperatures of up to
      130[deg.] C. are employed to reduce the conversion time to about
      one minute.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Ninhydrin derivatization often yields two absorbances in a
      semiochemical shark repellent, one at 570 nm and one at 440 nm,
      corresponding to primary and secondary amine functions
      respectively. For example, the absorbance spectra of a
      semiochemical extraction from the head of C. perezii (using 50%
      water, 40% methanol, 6.5% ethanol, and 3.5% methyl isobutyl
      ketone) derivatized with 0.1 g ninhydrin at 40[deg.] C. for 15
      minutes is found in FIG. 8. Clear maxima are observable at 440 nm
      (around 4 AU) and 570 nm (2.9 AU). When primary and secondary
      amines are not present, and the sample is derivatized with
      ninhydrin, absorbances at 440 nm and 570 nm are not observed. A
      uv-visible spectrum of 50% w/w ammonium acetate (a discredited
      shark repellent) in water, derivatized with 0.1 g ninhydrin at
      40[deg.] C. for 15 minute showed no maxima at 440 or 570 nm. (See
      FIGS. 8 and 9.)<br>
      <br>
      [0159] Products absorbing at 440 nm and 570 nm may additionally be
      resolved and detected using an HPLC and an ultraviolet-visible
      detector as described for end-point determination above. When
      ninhydrin-derivatized semiochemical extracts are run on HPLC with
      the following parameters a distinctive chromatograph is produced:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>

      &nbsp; <br>
      For primary amines, three distinct 570 nm absorbing peaks elute at
      about 5, about 6 and about 7 minutes. (See FIG. 5.) For secondary
      amines, a distinctive pattern of 440 nm absorbing peaks elute. A
      sharp peak in the middle to later thirty minute range elutes
      followed about two minutes later by a broad double peaked elution.
      (See FIG. 6.)<br>
      <br>
      [0160] 5. Thin-Layer Chromatography<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Flash chromatography and thin-layer chromatography may be
      performed, in order to observe amine components in ninhydrin
      derivatized samples. Using the following system, the primary and
      secondary amines can be well separated via flash chromatography:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Stationary phase:&nbsp; Silica gel, 230-400 mesh<br>
      Mobile phase:&nbsp; 66% n-butanol, 33% methyl formate, 1% glacial
      acetic<br>

      Column height:&nbsp; 6''-30'', packed height, or 8'' * 8'' plates<br>
      Sample:&nbsp; 0.2 micron-filtered, derivatized with 1% ninhydrin<br>
      &nbsp; in 2-propanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] In thin-layer chromatography, the underivatized sample is
      spotted. After the endpoint is reached, the plate is developed
      with either 1% ninhydrin in 2-propanol solution, or the
      OPA-2-mercaptoethanol solution described earlier. The mobile phase
      should be optimized for optimal retention factors (Rf's).<br>
      <br>
      <b>II. CONSPECIFIC AND HETEROSPECIFIC EFFECTIVE ELASMOBRANCH
        REPELLENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0163] The biological activity of elasmobranch-repelling
      semiochemicals extracted from various orders of elasmobranchs,
      particularly, Orders Orectolobiformes, Lamniformes,
      Carcharhiniformes and Squaliformes, has been demonstrated in
      elasmobranchs of the Order Carcharhiniformes and Order
      Lamniformes. Repellent activity has also been observed in
      conspecific species interactions and heterospecific species
      interactions. ((See Table 1)).<br>
      <br>
      [0164] Semiochemical extractions produced from pelagic Lamniforms
      have demonstrated repellency on inshore Carcharhiniformes (e.g.,
      ML1, ML2, B, GWH). Semiochemical extractions produced from inshore
      Carcharhiniformes have demonstrated repellency on highly migratory
      (pelagic) Carcharhiniformes (e.g., GCC). Semiochemical extractions
      produced from a Squaliform have demonstrated repellency on
      Carcharhiniformes (e.g., SQ1). Semiochemical extractions produced
      from one or more species of Carcharhiniformes have demonstrated
      repellency on entirely different species of Carcharhiniformes
      (e.g., CPP, GCC, CP). Semiochemical extractions produced from one
      species of Carcharhiniformes have demonstrated repellency on
      conspecific species (e.g., CP). Semiochemical extractions produced
      from one or more species of Orectolobiformes have demonstrated
      repellency on species of Carcharhiniformes (e.g., N2, BB1). (See
      Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0165] Repellency activity may be demonstrated in any method
      described above or known to one of skill in the art. For the
      investigations undertaken herein two common methods of testing
      repellent activity were most often used.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] A pressurized fluid delivery system was designed to deliver
      repellent into large feeding populations of sharks. The repellent
      was released as a subsurface cloud, which follows the current. A 1
      L plastic container containing the semiochemical solution was
      pressurized to approximately 20 psig with a battery compressor or
      hand pump. A globe valve was used to hold back the fluid. The
      fluid was delivered to the end of a long PVC pole using Teflon
      tubing. This allowed the operator to place the tip of the pole
      well into the population of feeding sharks. By actuating the small
      globe valve, a cloud of the solution was released quickly and
      reliably into the feeding population. Controls were established
      using FD&amp;C Red 40 dye and seawater, uncolored seawater, and
      air. These controls established that sharks were not afraid to
      approach the delivery pole, nor were sharks deterred from feeding
      by the jet of control fluid or air. During field tests with
      feeding populations of up to 12 Carcharhinus perezi with
      Carcharhinus acronatus, we consistently observed that as little as
      4 fl. oz (approx 129 ml) of semiochemical "A2" reduced the feeding
      population to zero within 2 minutes when administered with the
      above-described testing apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] Another method is a "tonic immobility" study. During tonic
      immobility studies, semiochemical is delivered using a plastic
      syringe, which is not in contact with the specimen. The test
      solution is released within 3 inches of the specimen's nose.
      Controls are established using separate syringes with seawater.
      Some controls were released with a high flow rate (30 mL/sec) in
      order to establish that sharks were not awakened by the jet of
      fluid over their noses.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] Using the above-described tests, the repellent
      characteristics of a wide range of semiochemicals prepared in
      accordance with the invention has been established. For example,
      semiochemical extractions produced from pelagic Lamniforms (e.g.,
      I. oxyrhincus) have demonstrated repellency on inshore
      Carcharhiniformes. In three tests, 450 ml to 700 ml doses of
      semiochemical composition GWH, derived from the head of a great
      white shark, repelled competitively-feeding blacknose and
      Caribbean reef sharks. (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0169] Semiochemical extractions produced from inshore
      Carcharhiniformes have demonstrated repellency on highly migratory
      (pelagic) Carcharhiniformes. A 500 mL dose of semiochemical
      composition A13N, derived from lemon sharks, nurse sharks, and
      spiny dogfish; repelled two adult blue sharks which were
      previously stimulated by acoustical and olfactory attractants.
      Similarly, a 500 mL dose of semiochemical composition GCC, derived
      from a tiger shark carcass, was observed to repel a large adult
      blue shark stimulated by acoustical and olfactory attractants.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] Semiochemical extractions produced from a Squaliform
      repelled species of Carcharhiniformes. A 250 mL dose of
      Composition SQ1, derived from the Cuban Dogfish, repelled
      competitively-feeding blacknose and Caribbean reef sharks. (See
      Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0171] Semiochemical extractions produced from one or more species
      of Carcharhiniformes repelled entirely different species of
      Carcharhiniformes. A 500 mL dose of semiochemical composition CPP,
      derived from the head of a sandbar shark, repelled
      competitively-feeding blacknose and Caribbean reef sharks.
      Similarly, a 500 mL dose of composition A2, derived from lemon,
      nurse, and dogfish carcasses, repelled two adult bull sharks
      stimulated with olfactory attractants.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] Semiochemical extractions produced from one species of
      Carcharhiniformes repelled a conspecific species of
      Carcharhiniformes (e.g., CP). In four tests using an aerosol
      delivery canister, semiochemical composition CP, derived from the
      head of a Caribbean Reef Shark, repelled competitively-feeding
      blacknose and Caribbean reef sharks. (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0173] Semiochemical extractions produced from one or more species
      of Orectolobiformes repelled species of Carcharhiniformes. In
      tests using captive juvenile lemon sharks, aversive swimming
      responses were observed with a 10 mL dose of semiochemical
      extraction from nurse shark carcasses. Similarly, a 10 mL dose of
      semiochemical from a bamboo shark carcass produced aversive
      swimming responses in captive juvenile lemon sharks. (See Table
      1).<br>

      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] In sum, it has been demonstrated that a semiochemical
      extraction of the order Lamniformes repels a Carcharhiniform, a
      semiochemical extraction of the order Carcharhiniformes repels a
      Lamniforme, a semiochemical extraction of the order Orectolobiform
      repels a Carcharhiniform and a semiochemical extraction of the
      order Squaliform repels a Carcharhiniform. Likewise, a

      conspecifically repels a Carcarhiniform. (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0176] The repellents and methods describe herein provide the
      artisan with chemicals that have been demonstrated to repel, at
      very low concentrations, families of shark known to migrate in
      shallow coastal waters and species known to attack humans. In
      contrast to earlier ineffective chemicals, the inventors have
      discovered and herein disclose an effective semiochemical
      repellent shown to result from decomposing shark tissue.
      Controlled studies of these substances have shown that feeding is
      halted in a variety of species of sharks at low concentration. The
      present invention overcomes the hazards of earlier-tested noxious
      chemicals such as the nerve toxin VX by producing a safe-to-handle
      extract that does not to harm or kill sharks, does not harm humans
      and does not harm other marine organisms. Further, it is reported
      herein that teleost fishes, such as the Yellowfin Tuna,
      demonstrate no aversive response in the presence of repellents of
      the invention. Only sharks appear to be deterred by the compounds.<br>

      <b>III. METHODS AND DEVICES OF DELIVERY OF REPELLENT</b><br>
      <br>
      [0177] Once prepared using the methods of the invention, a
      semiochemical repellent may be delivered to the environment of an
      elasmobranch through a variety of methods and devices of delivery.
      Alternative non-limiting embodiments of methods of and devices for
      delivering a semiochemical repellent into an elasmobranch
      environment include an extendable pressurized delivery device such
      as a pole with a pressurized discharge tube for safe delivery to
      stimulated sharks during scientific inquiry, a pressurized
      repellent gun, a miniature pressurized repellent gun to be worn on
      the wrist or ankle, a spear fishing gun with an adjacent repellent
      cylinder, a time release sponge-material attached to a surfboard
      or otherwise placed near a diver, swimmer or in some other place
      of interest, a hollow surfboard with a calibrated drip to emit
      repellent, a pump delivery system affixed to a surfboard, a
      pressurized delivery device affixed to a surfboard wherein
      discharge of repellent may be triggered by the surfer, a
      floatation device, a wristwatch filled with repellent (pressurized
      or unpressurized), a carbon dioxide activated pressurized syringe,
      an aerosol bomb, a mortar-launched aerosol bomb, a
      remote-controlled buoy with a repellent tank that may be fired by
      a lifeguard or other person or mechanized system, a buoy with a
      metering pump that runs during swim time (daylight), a repellent
      pouch attached to longlines (muslin/burlap bags) or to clothing or
      surfboard or other water device, jellied repellent (glycol
      ether/hydroxypropylcelluose gels which time-dissolve in water),
      sunscreen/sun care formulations containing repellent, lotions
      containing repellent, porous fabric impregnated with repellent,
      rechargeable porous fabric impregnated with repellent, a kite- or
      balloon-deployed repellent bomb (remote control), a submerged
      repellent mine (remote control) for deeper water, a
      cattle-treatment drench gun converted to shark repellent gun
      (http://www.dr-register.com/drenchgun.htm), repellent-impregnated
      cable insulation and cable jackets for undersea lines.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Exemplary, non-limiting devices for and methods of
      administering elasmobranch repellents are discussed in detail in
      the following section.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] A variety of delivery devices known in the art are
      illustrated in FIG. 24. For example, semiochemical repellent may
      be discharged through a pressurized tube that runs alongside an
      extended or extendable poll. (FIG. 24A.) The pressurized delivery
      pole apparatus may be useful for administering repellent to
      feeding or otherwise stimulated sharks. The apparatus may comprise
      a delivery device housing (pole) (310) with a repellent discharge
      tube (320) housed along or within the pole. The repellent
      discharge tube may be connected to a pressurized chamber or
      chambers (340) containing repellent (360). The delivery device may
      contain a check valve (370) to facilitate the maintenance of
      pressure. A trigger (350) may allow the pressurized repellent to
      discharge through the tube (320) and away from the pole (310). The
      pole may also contain a hook (330) or other device for presenting
      bait or other stimulant to the sharks at the end of the pole
      (310). During experimentation, the tube may be connected to more
      than one chamber (340) containing more than one experimental
      repellent solution (360). An alternative delivery device may be a
      pressurized syringe. (FIG. 24B.) Such a syringe (410) may be
      filled with repellent (450). It may have a plunger (420) to
      provide pressure and optionally to expel the solution from the
      syringe. It may also comprise a trigger (450), a check valve
      (470), a pressure release cap (490) and a nozzle (425). When the
      plunger is pressed, the cap (490) pops off the syringe and the
      pre-pressurized repellent is expelled in a pressurized stream. A
      commercially available delivery device is a cattle-treatment
      "drench" gun converted into a shark repellent gun comprising a
      reservoir (401) for repellent (402) and plunger (404) with
      reservoir filling handle (407), a trigger (405) and a discharge
      tube (406). (FIG. 24C.) The drench gun may be obtained from Dr.
      Register &amp; Associates, 1513 5th Ave., East Menomonie, Wis. A
      cattle-treatment drench gun may be used to deliver a pressurized
      stream of semiochemical repellent in accordance with the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] A. Pressurized Container Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0181] An exemplary and non-limiting semiochemical delivery device
      in accordance with the invention is a pressurized container
      comprising semiochemical. The container preferably may be of
      sufficient size to contain, and likewise comprise, sufficient
      repellent for at least one delivery of semiochemical sufficient to
      evoke a flight response in a shark, e.g., an aerosol can filled
      with repellent. (See FIG. 25.) The container may be constructed of
      degradable material. A non-limiting pressurized aerosol container
      (10) for administration of semiochemical repellent to a shark
      environment in accordance with the present invention may comprise
      a pressurized container (11) with sufficient tensile strength for
      pressurization and preferably sufficient capacity to hold a
      sufficient amount of semiochemical repellent (50) to repel at
      least one elasmobranch upon administration to water. The container
      may preferably be of sufficient size to be held comfortably in the
      human hand such that it could be thrown or released into water
      from the human grasp. The pressurized delivery device (10) may
      further comprise compressed gas (40) sufficient to expel the
      semiochemical repellent (50) contained therein. The container is
      preferably asymmetrically weighted having a weight (13) at the top
      (12) or base (14) portion of the container. The position of the
      weightedness of the container may be varied throughout the shape
      of the delivery device. The device may further comprise a nozzle
      (22) that is preferably a directional discharge nozzle. The device
      may further comprise an actuator (21) that when engaged allows the
      compressed contents of the aerosol container to be expelled. The
      device further preferably comprises a continuous discharge
      apparatus (20) to allow the contents of the can to be expelled
      with a single activation of the discharge apparatus (20).
      Preferably, when the actuator (21) is engaged, the nozzle (22)
      remains open to allow the can to be continuously and fully
      evacuated. The actuator preferably cannot be casually disengaged
      once engaged. The device (10) preferably floats. When the actuator
      (20) is engaged and the container (10) is disposed in water (60)
      the combination of continuous discharge, asymmetrical weight and
      motion of water allows the container (10) to move erratically on
      the surface of the water while spraying a cloud (61) of repellent
      into the water and placing a mist of repellent in the air (62)
      just above the surface of the water (60). Cloud dispersion, as
      used in this specification, includes dispersion in the air or
      water wherein the repellent is delivered as a liquid, mist, spray
      or foam. The directional movement of the device (10) may be
      alternatively manipulated by moving the relative positions of a
      weighted portion (13) of the container. As illustrated, the
      container (10) should discharge repellant proportionately more in
      the water than in the air since the weight (13) is in vicinity of
      the actuator (20). Movement may also be altered by altering the
      shape (15) of the container or by altering the direction of the
      discharge of the nozzle (22). For example, the canister may be in
      the shape of a ball, thereby limiting the impact of axial
      rotation, and the direction of discharge may be positioned to
      discharge along the canister axis, thereby limiting the impact of
      medial rotation.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] Erratic motion may be created by several characteristics of
      a pressurized container, each characteristic representing a
      non-limiting alternative of a delivery device in accordance with
      the invention. In a non-limiting preferred alternative, an aerosol
      container of the invention floats. This allows erratic movement on
      the surface of the water as the repellent is expelled at or near
      the surface of the water. In another non-limiting alternative, the
      container does not float. It sinks into the water and repellent is
      discharged directly into the water where it provides a high
      concentration of the repellent in a desired place.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] In a non-limiting alternative, the container is
      cylindrically shaped such that it will spin axially and medially
      while the repellent is expelled. Spinning rapidly may lure sharks
      while spraying repellent in a wide area. In another alternative,
      the delivery device may have more than one nozzle such that
      repellent may be released in more than one direction at once.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] In a non-limiting configuration, the device is heavier on
      an end of the container not comprising a nozzle. In a non-limiting
      preferred configuration, the device is heavier on an end of the
      container comprising a nozzle. When the container with pressurized
      repellent is placed in water, the weightier end initially sinks
      into the water and directs the nozzle into the water. When
      discharged into the water, the force of expulsion drives the
      nozzle into the air. When discharged into the air, the repellent
      travels considerably farther before settling to the surface of the
      water than it would after direct discharge into the water. In
      another non-limiting preferred configuration having a weightier
      nozzle end, when initial discharge occurs into the water, the
      pressure from the discharge drives the nozzle into the air. When
      the nozzle reaches the surface of the water, the combination of
      weightedness and pressure from discharge drive the nozzle to the
      water. A series of these opposing forces results in discharge of
      the semiochemical over a wide range, covering a large arc both in
      the air and in the water. Such an asymmetrical embodiment of a
      container would move more erratically in the water as the volume
      of pressurized repellent is released than would a symmetrical
      embodiment. Erratic movement is created by, among other things,
      the pressure of the released repellent acting against the weight
      of the nozzle-end of the container and the buoyancy of the
      container floating in the waves of the body of water. (See FIG.
      25.) The erratic motion also acts as an attractant to sharks and
      serves as a mechanism to distract sharks away from swimmers or
      other endangered things and than to repel the shark from the
      surrounding area by directly exposing the shark to a concentration
      of repellent near the container.<br>

      <br>
      [0186] A non-limiting delivery device of the invention comprises
      delivery of a pressurized container or a pouch containing
      repellent of the invention into the ocean from a mortar tube
      activated with compressed gas. (FIG. 26.) In one aspect of the
      delivery device, the container is an aerosol container (110) and
      is placed in a mortar tube (115) with a
      compressed-gas-mortar-charging-device (116) beneath the container
      (110). Activation of compressed gas (170) launches the canister in
      an arc toward a desired elasmobranch environment (163). The
      actuator (121) is triggered by dissolution of the actuator plug
      (123) when the canister encounters the water. In a preferred
      embodiment, dissolution of the actuator plug (123) actuates
      discharge of the repellent within several seconds. The mortar tube
      allows access to elasmobranch environments that are not
      immediately otherwise accessible. Discharge of the mortar tube
      propels the container over a distance toward an area where a shark
      may be expected or detected.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] C. Raft/Buoy Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0188] Another non-limiting delivery device of the invention
      comprises a raft (201) or other floating or fixed device
      comprising a floating buoy (280), a solid platform (281), and a
      container (211) of repellent (250) connected to a pump (270) with
      a power source (not shown) that is capable of delivering repellent
      into a shark environment either by automatic timing, remote
      triggering or other actuating mechanism (271). The container (211)
      comprises a check valve (215) that allows the pump (270) to build
      pressure in the container (211) to a desired pressure. When a
      desired pressure is achieved, a release valve (223) or
      pressure-release cap releases the pressurized repellent (250) into
      a delivery tube (217). The repellent is expelled across the water,
      spreading a wide cloud of repellent. (FIG. 27.)<br>
      <br>
      [0189] The pump may be automatically activated by a timer or may
      be activated remotely. The pump preferably delivers sufficient
      repellent into the water to repel sharks. Preferably, the
      discharge tube is long enough and not submerged such that when
      delivery begins, the repellent is sprayed a substantial distance
      onto the surface of the water and, under pressure, the discharge
      tube (217) moves erratically across a large radial area in
      relation to the raft (201). In a preferred embodiment the
      discharge tube is made of flexible material. Preferably the
      discharge tube will spray over an entire 360 degree arc.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] A specific non-limiting preferred device in accordance with
      the invention is a raft/buoy that holds 2 liters of repellent.
      (See FIG. 27.) The raft is anchored, e.g., at a sandbar or a
      region where a shark might enter a shallow swimming area. If a
      shark is spotted by a lifeguard, the lifeguard would hit a remote
      control button. At the buoy or raft, a radio receiver switches on
      the air pump. Air is pumped quickly into the 2 liter plastic tank,
      which has a check valve to allow fast buildup of head pressure.
      Once enough pressure builds up, a cap on the delivery tube pops
      off of the tube, spraying repellent multi-directionally at about
      20-30 psi.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] D. Hand-Held Pressurized Discharge Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0192] A non-limiting delivery device in accordance with the
      invention is a delivery device and method of delivery of
      semiochemical repellent using a pressurized directional device.
      (See FIGS. 28 and 31.) The pressurized directional device
      comprises a sufficiently sized container for repellent to provide
      sufficient repellent to the environment of a shark to evoke a
      flight reaction. The pressurized directional device further
      comprises a pressurizing mechanism such as a pump or a compressed
      gas cylinder through which a pressure may be placed on the
      container of semiochemical repellent to expel the repellent. The
      pressurized directional device further comprises a discharge
      nozzle that preferably focuses a stream of semiochemical repellent
      in a particular direction under pressure when the repellent is
      expelled from the pressurized chamber. The pressure in the
      container of repellent is maintained, for example, with a check
      valve. The pressurized directional delivery device further
      comprises a mechanism for releasing the pressurized repellent
      through the delivery nozzle, such as a valve or cap that releases
      at a prescribed pressure or upon trigger by the user. In a
      non-limiting alternative, the gun is fitted with backpack straps
      (595). (See FIG. 31.)<br>
      <br>
      [0193] A specific non-limiting semiochemical delivery device in
      accordance with the invention may also comprise a semiochemical
      repellent gun (510). (FIG. 28.) The gun may have one or more
      chambers (520) for repellent (550), each chamber connected to at
      least one source of compressed air (540) through a check valve
      (515). The end of the chamber may have a capped directional outlet
      (560). When the compressed air is introduced through the check
      valve (515) and the cap (523) is sprung from the end of the gun,
      the repellent (550) in the chamber is expelled in the direction of
      a shark or the environment of a shark. The discharge nozzle may be
      connected to a tube of any length to discharge the repellent over
      any length necessary to deliver the repellent into a desired
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] E. Repellent Dispersing Pouch<br>
      <br>
      [0195] A non-limiting semiochemical delivery device in accordance
      with the invention (see FIG. 28) also comprises a pouch (610)
      containing repellent (650). Repellent may be in the form of a
      solution or solid, preferably partly or wholly soluble. The
      repellent may be introduced to the environment of the shark by
      diffusion or by rupturing (655), tearing or otherwise penetrating
      the pouch. A pouch may also diffuse (656) repellent through its
      fabric. A diffusing pouch may be attached to a fishing net or
      longline (690) with a baited hook (691) on a snood (693) to allow
      repellent to slowly diffuse (656) into the water surrounding bate
      (692) or fishing net. The pouch will provide sufficient repellent
      around the baited hook to repel sharks while not repelling the
      desired teliost fish. A pouch to be placed on a longline may
      preferably be constructed of muslin or burlap.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] F. Longline Fishing Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0197] Sharks represent a significant problem in the long line
      fishing industry. Commercial longline fishing operations routinely
      target swordfish and tuna, however, the hook is not selective, and
      sharks are sometimes caught in greater numbers than the intended
      catch. A non-limiting method of delivery of semiochemicals in
      accordance with the invention is a mass or part or piece of
      decayed elasmobranch treated with a polar solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] Semiochemicals on longlines in accordance with the
      invention are preferably soluble in seawater, and, at a sufficient
      concentration to produce flight responses in elasmobranches.
      Teleost fish are not affected by the semiochemicals. It is
      theorized that this phenomenon is determined by receptor
      specificity. Yellowfin tuna (T. albacares) and six species of reef
      fish were observed to feed directly in a cloud of the
      semiochemical.<br>
      <br>
      [0199] Since shark-repelling semiochemicals can be derived from
      decayed shark carcasses, sections of an actual shark carcass are
      utilized in accordance with a non-limiting aspect of the invention
      to control by-catch. Small pieces of the carcasses, which have
      been aerobically decayed and exposed to polar solvents, are
      suitable as a source of semiochemicals and also remain on a hook
      for considerable periods of time. The piece of decayed polar
      solvent treated carcass is applied to the hook along with standard
      bait or attractant, such as mackerel or squid, in approximately
      equal mass. Therefore, each hook contains two pieces of material:
      an attractant for fish and sharks, and a shark repellent. Since
      the target fish do not detect the shark-repelling semiochemicals,
      they are likely to navigate to the attractant/bait and strike the
      hook. However, a shark navigating the odor plume towards the hook
      will continue to experience an increasing concentration of the
      semiochemical and will find the bait less attractive. The bait
      will therefore be avoided by sharks but attracted by commercially
      valuable fish.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] When producing semiochemicals by extraction, it is
      desirable to utilize blue shark (Prionace glauda) carcasses, since
      this species presents the largest by-catch in commercial longline
      fisheries. Two adult blue carcasses are sufficient to produce at
      least 200 hooks worth of repelling mass. As a result, the carcass
      of two blue sharks has the potential to spare the lives of 198
      other sharks.<br>
      <br>
      [0201] The decayed polar solvent treated shark carcass must not be
      employed before the proper semiochemicals have been produced. A
      freshly-killed shark carcass, for example, serves as an attractant
      for other sharks. Even carcasses which have been decaying for days
      may not possess the proper flora of semiochemicals. Decay
      conditions must be carefully controlled. For example,
      anaerobically-decayed carcasses are not suitable. Also, most
      non-polar solvents kill or inhibit sufficient bacterial and
      enzymatic reaction necessary to produce semiochemicals. Therefore,
      the manufacturer must possess the proper analytical tools in order
      to detect the presence of semiochemicals.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] Once semiochemicals in sufficient abundance are detected,
      the decay process may be halted either by lowering temperature,
      immersion in solvents for preservation until use, or by filtering
      the extraction. If catabolism continues unchecked, all tissue will
      be putrefied and the semiochemical compounds will be catabolized
      into other products. Usually, the detection of large quantities of
      uric acid signals that catabolism has progressed too far.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] The mass of decayed shark carcass ranges from 40 g to 200
      g, practically, but may be expanded to 10 g to 500 g in order to
      match the mass of the attractant bait used. Larger quantities of
      the decayed matter are typically used when whole mackerel are
      deployed as the bait.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] It is desirable to encase the individual masses of decayed
      shark carcass in a disposable container or slow-dissolving polymer
      matrix which activates in water, such as a high molecular-weight
      DOW CHEMICAL POLYOX. Properly-decayed shark carcasses may also
      undergo a secondary chemical treatment which introduces other
      repellent compounds into the tissue. For example, COMPOSITION 3M4,
      produced by SHARKDEFENSE LLC, is a gustatory repellent in sharks.
      The decayed matter may be treated with a solution of
      dimethylsulfoxide and COMPOSITION 3M4, thereby impregnating the
      decayed matter with a second potent repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0205] Another non-limiting alternative comprises a tube extending
      the length of the longline comprising discharge tubes at each
      snood. (See FIG. 30.) A pump may meet sufficient repellent to each
      discharge tube to repel sharks. Another embodiment comprises the
      structure of FIG. 30 over a relatively small distance, such as 20
      feet. This embodiment is especially useful for research related to
      shark repellents. This embodiment may also be applied, for
      example, to buoys surrounding, e.g., a swimming area.<br>
      <br>
      [0206] Repellent may also be applied along the entire longline by
      brushing or soaking prior to placing the longline into the water.
      Likewise, the longline may comprise porous material that will
      allow adsorption of repellent and discharge of said repellent over
      time. In another non-limiting delivery device for longline fishing
      in accordance with the invention, semiochemicals or a mass of
      carcass comprising semiochemicals may be affixed to a net or other
      kind of fishing tackle.<br>
      <br>
      [0207] A non-limiting semiochemical delivery device in accordance
      with the invention may also comprise an apparatus for
      administering repellent along longline fishing tackle. (FIG. 30.)
      The apparatus (710) comprises a pressurized chamber (720)
      connected to a source of compressed gas (740), contains repellent
      (750) and is connected to a primary delivery tube (717). The
      primary delivery tube is positioned adjacent to or otherwise in
      concert with the longline (718). Additional secondary delivery
      tubes (719) are joined to the primary delivery tube (717) in
      proximity to each snood (793) of the longline. The secondary
      delivery tubes terminate near the baited hook (791) of the snood.
      When pressurized repellent is released from the chamber (720), the
      repellent is delivered along the primary delivery tube (717) and
      into the secondary delivery tubes (719) thereby discharging
      repellent (750) near the baited hook (791) and repelling sharks
      from the bait.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] G. Backpack Pressurized Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0209] A non-limiting semiochemical delivery device in accordance
      with the invention may also comprise a backpack (595) repellent
      delivery device (500) comprising two chambers (520) of pressurized
      repellent (550) and a nozzled spray gun (510). (FIG. 31.) The
      backpack may be worn by scuba divers or snorkelers or other and
      may provide two or more charges of elasmobranch repellent while
      diving or snorkeling without resort to a repellent source on
      shore.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] H. Spear Gun with Pressurized Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0211] A non-limiting semiochemical delivery device in accordance
      with the invention may also comprise a spear gun (845) further
      fitted with a repellent gun (810), as described in section D
      above. (FIG. 32.)<br>
      <br>
      [0212] I. Surfboard Fitted with Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0213] A non-limiting semiochemical delivery device in accordance
      with the invention may comprise a surfboard comprising a hollow
      chamber for containing semiochemical repellent. FIG. 33A
      illustrates a specific non-limiting embodiment of surfboard with a
      pressurized chamber that is discharged by the surfer in an
      emergency. A surf board (910) comprising a pressurized chamber
      (920) for repellent (950) comprising a source of compressed gas
      (925) for expelling repellent (950) through a release valve (984)
      and into a discharge tube (919) in, for example, an elasmobranch
      emergency situation. Discharge of repellent may be triggered by a
      surfer via a remote control triggering device (971) or with an
      ankle-band triggering device (972) or wrist-band triggering
      device. In another specific and non-limiting embodiment, the
      discharge tube (919) allows repellent to be periodically
      introduced into the environment of the surf board via a drip valve
      (983). In such an alternative, the chamber (920) need not be held
      under pressure and no source of compressed gas is necessary.
      Instead, the repellent may be allowed to leak through the drip
      valve (983) by supplying, for example, a source of air or vent
      (927) in a cap or other sealant (928) of a reservoir-filling end
      (926) of the chamber (920). FIG. 33B illustrates such a surfboard
      with a chamber for containing repellent (920) a drip valve (984) a
      vent (927) and a discharge tube (919) for continuous discharge of
      repellent (950) during surfing. A chamber alternatively may be
      strapped to the side of the surfboard. A further alternative
      comprises a plastic container drilled into the surface of the
      surfboard. One or more than one discharge tube is contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0214] J. Wristwatch Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0215] FIG. 34 illustrates a non-limiting delivery device in
      accordance with the invention comprising a wristwatch (1010) and
      further comprising a repellent chamber or container (1020). In a
      non-limiting aspect in accordance with the invention the chamber
      is pressurized. Repellent is released from the chamber by
      activating a trigger (1021). In a specific non-limiting embodiment
      another non-limiting aspect in accordance with the invention a cap
      is removed. In another specific alternative embodiment the chamber
      is ruptured with a knife or by applying pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] K. Belt or Bracelet Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0217] FIG. 35 illustrates a non-limiting delivery device attached
      to a belt (FIG. 35A) or bracelet (FIG. 35B) and further comprising
      pressurized repellent in accordance with the present invention. A
      specific non-limiting embodiment alternative comprises a wristband
      (1101) or belt (1102) with a repellent gun (1103) with a chamber
      (1110) containing pressurized repellent (1150), a source of
      compressed gas (1170) a check valve (1115) a trigger (1197) and a
      nozzle with a pressure release valve (1122) to discharge the
      repellent into the environment of the wearer of the wristband and
      preferably in a desired direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] The invention is further described with the following
      non-limiting examples, which are provided to further illuminate
      aspects of the invention.<br>

      Example 1<br>
      <br>
      Preparation and Testing of Semiochemical GWH<br>
      <br>
      Example 1A<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of Semiochemical GWH from Order Lamniformes<br>
      <br>
      [0219] GWH was aerobically prepared from the head of a great white
      shark (C. carcharias, Order Lamniformes) in a polypropylene
      extraction vessel. The carcass head was allowed to decay
      aerobically for 10 days in a covered polypropylene container. The
      carcass head was then fully immersed in solvent in a polypropylene
      extraction vessel. The extraction solvent was 50:50 water:solvent,
      by weight. The solvent was 80% methanol, 17% ethanol, and 3%
      methyl isobutylketone. Extraction time was 6 months at 25[deg.] C.
      with slow agitation (container was shaken or stirred during
      sampling intervals). The extraction was periodically sampled by
      HPLC in accordance with the above described method. After several
      months signature peaks were noted at about 5, about 6 and about 7
      minutes. The extraction process was terminated by filtering to
      remove tissue. The resulting filtrate was containerized in a
      polypropylene container. Extraction time was 6 months at room
      temperature. The carcass processed for semiochemical GWH was
      obtained from the U.S. Government (National Oceanic and
      Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service-Galveston, Tex.
      (USA)), which had frozen the great white shark carcass after it
      had been caught as bycatch.<br>
      <br>
      Example 1B<br>
      <br>
      Testing of Semiochemical GWH for Repellent Activity<br>
      <br>
      [0220] GWH was tested for repellent activity against blacknose
      sharks (C. acronotus Order Carcharhiniformes) and Caribbean reef
      sharks (C. perezii Order Carcharhiniformes) present in a
      population of 9 sharks. The target sharks were stimulated with
      bait. A 500 mL dose of GWH was introduced to the shark population
      as a cloud. The sharks were visibly repelled from the feeding
      zone. (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      Example 1C<br>
      <br>
      UV-Vis Spectrum of Semiochemical GWH<br>
      <br>
      [0221] GWH was spectrophotometrically analyzed in the uv-visible
      range. A dual-beam Perkin Elmer Lambda 12 model scanning
      spectrophotometer was used. Neat semiochemical solutions were
      micron-filtered and loaded into quartz cuvettes. Representative
      uncontaminated solvents were used in the extraction process, at
      the same ratios used to perform the extraction, were used as a
      reference sample. The resulting spectrum is contained in FIG. 2
      and labeled GWH. A distinct and strong absorbance peak is
      observable between about 300 nm and about 340 nm.<br>

      HPLC Chromatogram of Semiochemical GWH<br>
      <br>
      [0222] A chromatograph of GWH was created to determine the

      [0234] Semiochemical GWH was derivatized with 0.1 g ninhydrin at
      40[deg.] C. for 15 minutes. The derivatized GWH was then subjected
      to HPLC analysis with detection at 570 nm to detect primary
      amines. (See FIG. 5.) The resulting chromatogram had a strong peak
      at around 7 minutes and two weaker peaks at around 5 and around 6

      [0236] Tests of GWH were run on Direct Injection GC-MS. The GWH
      semiochemical was injected neat into a Hewlett Packard model 6890
      GC with 5973 MSD in accordance with the parameters on the
      chromatogram. (See FIG. 7.) Analysis of the resulting mass
      spectrogram using NIST 98.1 provided the following non-limiting
      components of GWH: glycerin, N,N-dimethylurea, urea,
      5-methyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione (5-methylhydantoin), creatinine,
      methyl hexadecanoate (methyl palmitate),
      hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl)-pyrrolo, [1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione.

      Preparation and Repellent Testing of Semiochemical CP<br>
      <br>
      [0237] CP was aerobically prepared from the head of a Caribbean
      reef shark (C. perezii Order Charcharhiniformes). The carcass head
      was processed in the manner described above for semiochemical GWH.<br>
      <br>
      [0238] CP was tested for repellent activity against blacknose
      sharks and Caribbean reef sharks present in a population of 12
      sharks. The sharks were stimulated with bait. An aerosol canister
      containing 6 fluid oz. of CP was then introduced to the 12 sharks.
      All sharks were visibly repelled from the feeding zone. (See Table
      1). In three ensuing tests delivery of semiochemical CP from an
      aerosol canister again repelled competitively-feeding blacknose
      and Caribbean reef sharks.<br>

      UV-Vis Spectral Analysis of Ninhydrin-Derivatized CP<br>
      <br>
      [0239] Semiochemical CP was derivatized with 0.1 g ninhydrin at
      40[deg.] C. for 15 minutes. A uv-visible spectrogram was
      determined on a dual-beam Perkin Elmer Lambda 12 model. Neat CP
      was micron-filtered and loaded into quartz cuvettes.
      Representative uncontaminated solvents used in the extraction
      process, at the same ratios used to perform the extraction, were
      used as a reference sample.<br>
      <br>
      [0240] The absorbance spectra of semiochemical CP derivatized with
      ninhydrin provided clear maxima observable at 440 nm (around 4 AU)
      and 570 nm (2.9 AU). (See FIG. 8.) With ninhydrin derivatized
      extracts, 440 nm absorbance indicates secondary amines and 570 nm
      absorbance indicates the presence of primary amines. When primary
      and secondary amines are not present, and the sample is
      derivatized with ninhydrin, absorbances at 440 nm and 570 nm are
      not observed. A uv-visible spectrum of 50% w/w ammonium acetate (a
      discredited shark repellent) in water, derivatized with 0.1 g
      ninhydrin at 40[deg.] C. for 15 minute showed no maxima at 440 nm
      or 570 nm. (See FIG. 9.)<br>

      semiochemical was injected neat into a Hewlett Packard model 6890
      GC with 5973 MSD operating in accordance with the parameters on
      the chromatogram. (See FIG. 10.) Analysis of the mass spectrogram
      using NIST 98.1 resulted in the following non-limiting components
      of semiochemical CP: glycerin, N,N-dimethylurea, urea,
      5-methyl-2,4-imidazolidinedione (5-methylhydantoin), creatinine,
      hexahydro-3-(2-methylpropyl)-pyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione,

      Example 3A<br>
      <br>
      Preparation of Semiochemical A1<br>
      <br>
      [0242] Semiochemical A1 was aerobically prepared from the carcass
      of a lemon shark (N. brevirostris) a nurse shark (G. cirratum) and
      a spiny dogfish (S. acanthias) (each species in Order
      Carcharhiniformes). The carcasses were allowed to decay
      aerobically for 10 days in a covered polypropylene container RT.
      The carcasses were then fully immersed in solvent in a
      polypropylene extraction vessel. The extraction solvent was 50:50
      water:solvent, by weight. The solvent was 80% methanol, 17%
      ethanol, and 3% methyl isobutylketone. Extraction time was 6
      months at 25[deg.] C. with slow agitation. The extraction was
      periodically sampled and terminated after components of the
      extraction eluted from HPLC at the signature peaks of about 5,
      about 6 and about 7 minutes. The extraction process was terminated
      by filtering to remove tissue. The resulting filtrate was
      containerized in a polypropylene container.<br>

      Testing of Semiochemical A1 for Repellent Activity<br>
      <br>
      [0243] Semiochemical A1 was tested for repellent activity against
      blacknose sharks and Caribbean reef sharks present in a population
      of 15 sharks. The sharks were stimulated with bait. A 500 mL dose
      of A1 was introduced as a cloud to the 15 sharks. The sharks were
      visibly repelled from the feeding zone. (See Table 1).<br>

      HPLC Chromatograph of Semiochemical A1<br>
      <br>
      [0244] A chromatograph of A1 was created to determine the
      chromatographic signature of active components of the A1 extract.
      (See FIGS. 3 and 4.) HPLC parameters were the same as above for
      GWH. The early eluting chromatogram contained signature peaks at
      around 5, around 6 and around 7 minutes, respectively. (FIG. 3.)
      The late eluting chromatogram contained the signature peaks at
      around 31, around 34, around 36 and around 42 minutes. (See FIG.
      4.)<br>

      HPLC Chromatogram of Ninhydrin Derivatized A1<br>
      <br>
      [0245] Semiochemical A1 was derivatized with 0.1 g ninhydrin at
      40[deg.] C. for 15 minutes. The derivatized A1 was then subjected
      to HPLC analysis with detection at 570 nm to detect primary
      amines. (See FIG. 5.) The resulting chromatogram had a strong peak
      at around 7 minutes, a weaker peak at around 6 minutes and a very
      weak peak at around 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0246] Derivatized A1 was also subjected to HPLC analysis with
      detection at 440 nm to detect secondary amines. (See FIG. 6.) The
      resulting chromatogram demonstrated a strong and sharp peak around
      39 minutes and a strong broad peak with two components eluting
      about 2 minutes later.<br>

      Preparation and Testing of Semiochemical A2 from Multiple Orders<br>
      <br>
      Example 4A<br>
      <br>
      Preparation and Repellent Testing of Semiochemical A2<br>
      <br>
      [0247] Semiochemical A2 was aerobically prepared using the method
      described for GWH above from two lemon shark carcasses (N.
      brevirostris), one nurse shark carcass (G. cirratum), and one
      spiny dogfish carcass (S. acanthias) (orders Carcharhiniformes,
      Orectolobiformes, and Squaliformes, respectively).<br>
      <br>
      [0248] A2 was tested for repellent activity against blacknose
      sharks and Caribbean reef sharks present together in a population
      of 12 sharks. The 12 sharks were stimulated with bait. A 500 mL
      dose of A2 was introduced as a cloud to the 12 sharks. The sharks
      were visibly repelled from the feeding zone. (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0249] A2 was tested for repellent activity against lemon shark
      (N. brevironstris Order Carcharhiniformes). One lemon shark was
      successively placed in a state of tonic immobility and
      successively subjected to administration of A2 in a range from 7
      mL to 30 mL via a syringe. Each administration resulted in the
      termination of tonic immobility. (See Table 1). A2 was also tested
      against lemon shark in a diluted form. 30 mL and 60 mL of 0.1 ppm
      semiochemical A2 (diluted with HPLC-grade water) was introduced to
      a tonically immobile lemon shark. Tonic immobility was terminated
      with the dilute repellent. These data support a conclusion that
      the semiochemical A2 will meet the goal of the Johnson-Baldridge
      effective repellent concentration of 0.1 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      [0250] During tonic immobility studies, the semiochemical was
      delivered using a plastic syringe, which was not in contact with
      the specimen. The test solutions were released within 3 inches of
      the specimen's nose. Controls were established using separate
      syringes with seawater. Some controls were released with a high
      flow rate (30 mL/sec) in order to establish that sharks were not
      awakened by the jet of fluid over their noses.<br>
      <br>
      [0251] A2 was also tested for repellent activity against bull
      shark (C. leucas Order Carcharhiniformes). (See Table 1). Bull
      shark is considered the most dangerous inshore species of shark.
      Two sharks were stimulated with bait and subjected to 500 mL of A2
      in a cloud. The sharks were visibly repelled from the feeding
      zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0252] A2 was tested using the Johnson-Baldridge Test with
      blacktip sharks (C. limbatus Order Carcharhiniformes). (See Table
      1). A PVC tripod with a peristaltic metering pump set to meter out
      1 mL/min of A2 repellent, a video camera and a transmitter was
      situated in the ocean. A 6 cubic meter observation area under the
      tripod was marked off and compensated for tidal changes. A fish
      head was secured under the tripod, within view of the camera. In a
      series of control-only experiments, solvent was pumped into the
      observation area at the prescribed flow once a blacktip shark was
      present. Thereafter, in a series of treatment experiments, a fish
      head was secured, the pump was started, and the behavior of one
      blacktip shark was observed. The fish head was protected for one
      hour in the presence of the stimulated shark until the battery of
      the pump was exhausted.<br>

      UV-Vis Spectrum of Semiochemical A2<br>
      <br>
      [0253] A uv-visible spectrum of one-year-old A2 was compared with
      spectra from one-year old A13N and one-year-old SQ1. All three of
      these extracts demonstrated good flight responses in target
      sharks. The three spectra together demonstrate matching strong
      peaks in the 300 nm range. (See FIG. 11.)<br>

      headspace vial and capped with a Teflon butyl rubber septa. The
      vial was allowed to equilibrate at 30[deg.] C. overnight prior to
      analysis. The sample headspace was injected into a Hewlett Packard

      [0261] Based on the LC-MS data, the following structures are
      proposed. However, structures are proposed and are not intended to
      be limiting on the structure or makeup of the obtained
      semiochemical A2 as characterized by the LC-MS.<br>
      <br>
      [0262] Compounds that were detected using LC-MS are described
      below. A typical total ion chromatogram generated in the study is
      shown in FIG. 19. Supporting data are also included in Table 3.
      The structures that are proposed below are tentative assignments.<br>
      <br>
      [0263] Retention time 3.7 min, m/z 147.2<br>
      <br>
      [0000] This unknown was tentatively assigned as<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0264] Retention time 3.9 min, m/z 151.3<br>
      <br>
      [0000] It appears that the molecular weight of this unknown is 150
      and ions at M/z 189 and 227 are probably potassium adducts.
      However, m/z 227 may belong to a slightly later eluting component
      (see one of the compounds eluting at 4.2 minutes). Limited
      fragmentation pattern and the molecular weight would support the
      tentative proposed structure (II) of tartaric acid in FIG. 2:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0265] Retention time, 4.2 min<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Last significant peak is at m/z 263 and intense fragment
      ions at m/z 227, 207, 189, 151, 132.7 would appear to support a
      tentative proposed structure (III) of dibutyl tartarate.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0266] The possibility also exist that the above ions are related
      to different compounds. There is a question also whether m/z 263
      may be a protonated dimer of a component at m/z 131 (leucine, IV),
      and m/z 207 could be the monobutyl ester of tartaric acid. Again,
      peak at m/z 227 may be attributed to the next eluting component
      (see Structure VI below). Other structures were proposed for
      molecular weight 131 including creatine, 3-hydroxy-dl-proline,
      leucine (IV), or (V).<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0267] Retention time 4.2 min, m/z 227<br>
      <br>
      [0000] This has been tentatively assigned before as (VI).<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0268] Retention time 7.5 min, m/z 132.7<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The molecular weight appears to be 131. The components
      mentioned at retention time of 4.2 minutes are also possible for
      this component.<br>
      <br>
      [0269] Retention time 11.6 min, m/z 268.2<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Molecular weight of this unknown is 267. At the beginning,
      oleylamine or pyrroridine structure (VII) was considered for this
      unknown, but second derivative fragment at m/z 135.9 (M-132) could
      not be explained for these structures. An adenosine structure
      (VIII) is tentatively proposed for this unknown.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0270] Retention time 12.5 min, m/z 269.5<br>
      <br>
      [0000] An oleyl alcohol (IX) is proposed for this unknown.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0271] Retention time 12.8 min, m/z 166.3<br>
      <br>
      [0000] This is a nitrogen containing compound with molecular
      weight of 165. This compound could be phenylalanine (X). The
      second derivative data would support this assignment.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0272] Ret. time 15.2 min, m/z 372.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] This compound was observed in the previous study
      (R03-0299). A component at m/z 330 in the first study (R03-0215)
      was tentatively identified. This component is 42 mass units higher
      than the earlier identified compound and could be due to a
      tentatively proposed structure (XI). Fragmentation provides loss
      of 18 (loss of hydroxyl as water) and another loss of 17 mass
      units.<br>

      HPLC Chromatographs of Ninhydrin-Derivatized Semiochemical A2<br>
      <br>
      [0273] Semiochemical A2 was derivatized with 0.1 g ninhydrin for
      two hours at 40[deg.] C. The derivatized A2 was then subjected to
      HPLC analysis with detection at 570 nm to detect primary amines.
      (See FIG. 13.) The following system configuration was used with
      injection volume and mobile phase as set forth on the

      &nbsp; <br>
      The method produced around 5 characteristic peaks between 1 and 2
      minutes for primary amines at 570 nm. With detection at 440 nm for
      secondary amines and injection volume and mobile phase as set
      forth in FIGS. 14 and 15, the method likewise produced around 5
      characteristic peaks between 1 and 2 minutes. (See FIGS. 14 and
      15.) An entity at both detection wavelengths is observed at 4.8
      minutes with a trace concentration.<br>

      </b><b>Repelling of Mako Shark of Order Lamniformes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0292] A juvenile Mako shark (Order Lamniformes, Family Lamidae,
      Genus Isurus) was repelled by semiochemical repellent GCC. A buoy
      line baited with squid, blue fish, and striped bass was in the
      water. Mako sharks are known to attack swordfish, and eat prey
      such as blue fish and striped bass when it is available for
      consumption. A 500 mL charge to the line under CO2 pressure was
      applied. Diptubes were [1/4]'' HPDE. (See FIG. 30.) The bait was
      not taken.<br>
      <br>
      [0293] After coming in contact With the GCC, the Mako retreated
      and did not appear again. Subsequently, the shark could not be
      lured back to the site despite the application of three types of
      stimulants and several hours applying traditionally adequate scent
      and bait. After extensive attempts to re-lure the shark, only new
      blue sharks appeared well after the repellent would be expected to
      have completely dispersed. Generally, when repellent is not
      deployed, sharks remain in the area where scent and bait has been
      administered for an extended period of time (up to many hours).
      The failure of the shark to return after fleeing the exposure to
      GCC was interpreted as support for the strong action of the GCC
      semiochemical against the juvenile Mako shark.<br>
      <br>
      [0294] The test was done under the following conditions:<br>

      from Negaprion brevirostris, Ginglymostoma cirratum, Squalus
      cubensis, and Isurs oxyrinchus. All solutions were found to
      generally exhibit the sample characteristic absorbance maxima in
      the UV region. (See FIG. 2.) The four semiochemical solutions were
      derived from four different families of shark, Family
      Carcarhinidae, Ginglymostomatidae, Squalidae and Lanmidae,
      respectively. Each semiochemical exhibited the same repellency
      effects on other species, the common absorbance maxima, therefore,
      became a focus of finding an active chemical repellent entity.
      (See, e.g., Table 1). For example, a 100 mL dose of semiochemical
      solution prepared from spinal extracts of Squalus cubensis
      effectively repelled a small feeding school of Carcharhinus perezi
      and Carcharhinus acronatus.<br>

      </b><b>Comparison of UV-Vis Spectra of Semiochemicals of Different
        Species and Different Carcass Parts of Shark</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0307] Semiochemicals of different species and carcass parts of
      shark were subjected to uv-vis spectral analysis according to the
      above-discussed method. (See FIG. 2.) All extracts demonstrated a
      peak around 300 nm. The control (solvent-first line) demonstrates
      no absorbance shoulder around 300 nm. The semiochemical showing
      the strongest absorption in the signature 300 nm range is
      semiochemical GWH, which is an extraction of a great white shark
      head.<br>
      <br>
      [0308] Semiochemical abstracts GWH, GCC, N2 were demonstrated to
      have repellent activity. (See Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 19</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Shelf-Life of A2 and N2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0309] During a day of field tests on semiochemical repellents,
      experiments with a more-than-one-year-old sample of A2
      semiochemical repellent evoked only weak measurable flight
      response in a variety of sharks. Similar results were obtained
      with a more-than-one-year-old sample of N2. Because both A2 and N2
      had evoked strong flight responses in many tests in prior months,
      it was hypothesized that the A2 and N2 test samples had been
      degraded and the semiochemical components had been lost or reduced
      in concentration.<br>
      <br>
      HPLC Chromatograph Analysis<br>
      <br>
      [0310] Early eluting chromatograms of degraded A2 and N2 (FIGS. 22
      and 23) were compared to chromatograms of GWH and A1 (FIGS. 3 and
      4) to determine the chromatographic signature of active components
      of the GWH and A1 extracts. HPLC parameters were as discussed
      above. The chromatogram of GWH showed a strong peak around 7
      minutes, a weaker peak at around 6 minutes and a weak peak at
      around 5 minute (See FIG. 3.) The chromatograms of degraded A2 and
      N2 contained no peak at around 7 minutes, a peak comparable with
      the chromatogram of GWH at around 6 minutes and very weak peaks at
      5.2 and 5.4 minutes, respectively. (See FIG. 22.) The peaks at 5.2
      and 5.4 minutes had no clear correlation with the 5 minute peak of
      GWH.<br>
      <br>
      [0311] Late eluting chromatograms of A2 and N2 were likewise
      compared to GWH and A1. (FIGS. 4 and 23.) HPLC parameters were as
      discussed above. The chromatograms of GWH and A1 showed
      distinctive and expected peaks at around 34 minutes having a
      notably weaker earlier peak within the 34 minute peak. The GWH and
      A1 chromatograms likewise showed the expected broad peak about 2
      minutes following the 34 minute peak, with two maxima within the
      broad peak. The late eluting chromatograms of degraded A2 and N2
      had unexpectedly sharp peaks at around 32 minutes and somewhat
      sharp peaks about 2 minutes later that were distinctly different
      from the expected broad peak of an active semiochemical such as
      GWH or A1.<br>

      </b><b>Administration of Semiochemical Repellent Using a Canister</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0312] An aerosol container with a continuous-release actuator was
      pressurized with 6 fluid oz. of semiochemical CP. The container
      was constructed to be asymmetrically weighted so that it would not
      lie on its axis on the surface of the water. In this test, the
      container was lighter at its base and heavier at its discharging
      end. The actuator was depressed, initiating release of the CP
      semiochemical and thrown into a group of 12 feeding sharks. During
      the pressurized discharge of the extract, the canister moved
      erratically on the surface of the water. At times the
      semiochemical was expelled into the air creating a mist that
      subsequently fell on the surface of the water. At times, the
      semiochemical was expelled directly into the water. The feeding
      sharks were drawn to the erratic activity of the canister. When
      the sharks encountered the cloud of discharged semiochemical near
      the surface of the water, they fled. In a control, similar
      pressurized containers with 100% methanol instead of semiochemical
      were similarly thrown into a population of feeding sharks. The
      sharks were drawn to the container and did not flee. An expended
      container was recovered from the water with shark bite marks on
      it.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0313] A two liter repellent chamber was filled with repellent on
      a remote controlled raft. The raft was anchored at a sandbar where
      a shark might be expected to enter a shallow swimming area. A
      radio receiver was connected to a pump on the raft. The pump with
      its own power source was connected to the two liter chamber with
      tubing. The two liter chamber was provided a check valve for rapid
      build up of pressure from the pump. Tubing was then fixed from the
      two liter chamber exit portal away from the raft as a discharge
      tube. The tubing was not sufficiently long enough to enter the
      water where the raft was floating. The tubing exiting from the
      chamber was capped with a pressure release cap.<br>
      <br>
      [0314] A person remote from the raft signaled the radio receiver
      to trigger activation of the pump. The pump compressed air into
      the 2 liter plastic tank. Head pressure in the chamber increased
      quickly. Once enough pressure built up, the cap popped off of the
      tubing and repellent was rapidly sprayed over a 2 meter
      surrounding area at about 20-30 psi. The chamber was emptied
      within 20 seconds.<br>

      degraded semiochemical A2. A population of about 10 blacknose
      sharks and Caribbean reef sharks were stimulated with feed. A
      swimmer entered the water with the pressurized gun. When sharks
      approached, the swimmer discharged the first chamber in the
      direction of the sharks by pointing the directional nozzle and
      triggering the compressed gas canister. The sharks were partially
      repelled. The swimmer then discharged the second pressurized
      chamber in the direction of the sharks. The sharks were again
      partially repelled.<br>

      then baited, e.g., with mackerel. The longline is placed into the
      water. Sharks are deterred from striking the hook because of the
      semiochemical diffusing from the
      polar-solvent-treated-elasmobranch-carcass mass near the hook.
      Fish are not deterred. As a result, a tuna is caught on the hook.<br>

      [0317] Semiochemical was prepared in a jelly form that would
      dissolve over time when placed in water. 100 g diethylene glycol
      monoethyl ether was warmed to around 40[deg.] C. in a mixture with
      2 g of hydroxypropylmethylcelluose under heavy agitation. The
      mixture was allowed to cool with slow mixing to about 30[deg.] C.
      At around 30 C, around 20 mL of semiochemical CP was added with an
      eye dropper over about 2 minutes with slow mixing. The mixture was
      then cooled to room temperature. A firm gel was formed over night.
      About 10 g of gel was placed in about 125 mL of water. In about 8
      hours the gel was fully dissolved. Such administration of
      semiochemical could be particularly advantageous to divers and
      snorklers who would want to repel elasmobranchs but who would not
      want to repel fish.<br>

      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention relates generally to gustatory elasmobranch
      repellents comprising aldehydes, carboxylic acids, ketones,
      di-ketones, pyridines and anti-pyrines, separately or in
      combination.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The reality of shark (elasmobranch) attacks and a pervasive
      fear of shark attacks in the modern world combine to create a
      great need for effective shark repellents. Effective shark
      repellents are also needed in the commercial fishing industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Elasmobranchs represent a significant problem in the
      commercial fishing industry. Elasmobranchs are often inadvertently
      caught on fishing hooks and tackle directed at other more
      commercially valuable kinds of fish. This inadvertent catching of
      elasmobranchs (or other non-valued fish) is called "by-catch." As
      many as 100 million elasmobranchs are killed each year as
      by-catch. This loss of life has resulted in a real threat to
      several shark species. Currently, as many as 80 species of shark
      are considered threatened with extinction.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Further, when elasmobranchs are caught as by-catch, fishing
      operations receive no return on their investment since the shark
      is caught on a hook that might have otherwise brought in a
      marketable fish. Additionally, the fishing tackle on which a shark
      is caught often must be cut loose for the safety of those working
      on the fishing vessel causing a loss of both equipment and time.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Longlining is a commercial fishing method that suffers
      significant losses from shark by-catch. Longlining uses multiple
      baited individual fish hooks with leaders strung at intervals
      along an often very long (2-3 mile) main fishing line. Longline
      fishing operations routinely target swordfish and tuna. The
      longline hooks and bait, however, are not selective and
      elasmobranchs are sometimes caught in greater numbers than the
      intended target catch. The result is great loss of life in
      elasmobranchs and significant financial losses in the longline
      industry. Elasmobranchs cause additional losses in the longline
      fishing industry by scavenging marketable fish caught on longlines
      before the fish may be retrieved for processing. This problem also
      applies to the commercial trawling industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] There has been a long-felt need for methods and devices to
      deter elasmobranchs from commercial fishing lines and nets.
      Attempts in the middle of the twentieth century were made to
      protect trawl nets with electric discharge devices. Nelson, "Shark
      Attack and Repellency Research: An Overview," Shark Repellents
      from the Sea ed. Bernhard Zahuranec (1983) at p. 20).
      Nevertheless, no commercially effective repellent has been made
      available for reducing shark by-catch in the commercial fishing
      industry or for reducing loss of valuable fish or fishing tackle
      to shark predation.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] An effective shark repellent would not only be valuable to
      the fishing industry but also would be valuable for protecting
      humans from shark attacks. An effective repellent has yet to be
      marketed for limiting the risk of shark attacks faced by humans
      exposed to elasmobranchs. Over the last 50 years antishark
      measures employed to protect humans from sharks have included
      electrical repellent devices (Gilbert &amp; Springer 1963, Gilbert
      &amp; Gilbert 1973), acoustical playbacks (Myrberg et al. 1978,
      Klimley &amp; Myrberg 1979), visual devices (Doak 1974) and
      chemical repellents (Tuve 1963, Clark 1974, Gruber &amp; Zlotkin
      1982). None of these procedures proved satisfactory in preventing
      shark attacks. (Sisneros (2001)). As such, the long felt need for
      an effective repellent has not been satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Researchers have historically used several bio-assays to
      determine if a repellent evokes a flight response in shark. One
      such bio-assay measures the effect of a repellent on a shark that
      is immobilized in "tonic immobility." Tonic immobility is a state
      of paralysis that typically occurs when a shark is subject to
      inversion of its body along the longitudinal axis. This state is
      called "tonic," and the shark can remain in this state for up to
      15 minutes thereby allowing researchers to observe effects of
      repellents. After behavioral controls are established, an object
      or substance that has a repelling effect will awaken a shark from
      a tonic state. Researchers can quantify the strength of a
      repellent effect from these studies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] Applicant has discovered effective chemical repellents for
      elasmobranchs, which appear to affect the elasmobranch's gustatory
      (taste) receptors. According to the present invention, an
      elasmobranch repellent is provided comprising an aldehyde or a
      derivative thereof, a carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, a
      ketone or derivative thereof, a di-ketone or a derivative thereof,
      a pyridine or a derivative thereof, or an antipyrine or a
      derivative thereof, separately or in combination. When tested,
      these elasmobranch repellents are capable of terminating tonic
      immobility of a tonic-immobile elasmobranch when introduced to
      elasmobranch gustatory receptors.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] According to a first non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, a composition for repelling an elasmobranch is provided
      comprising an aldehyde or a derivative thereof. In a preferred
      non-limiting embodiment, the composition comprises a
      methylbutanal. In a more preferred non-limiting embodiment, the
      aldehyde is selected from 3-methylbutanal or 2-methylbutanal. In
      another preferred non-limiting embodiment, the composition
      comprises methylbutenal. In a more preferred non-limiting
      embodiment, the aldehyde is selected from 2-methylbutenal or
      3-methylbutenal.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In an alternative non-limiting preferred embodiment of the
      first embodiment, the aldehyde comprises a linear carbon chain of
      about 5 carbons. In a more preferred embodiment, the aldehyde is
      selected from valeraldehyde, pentanal or trans-pentenal.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In an alternative non-limiting preferred embodiment of the
      first embodiment, the aldehyde comprises a saturated carbon chain
      comprising 1 carbon to about 6 carbons. In a more preferred
      embodiment, the saturated aldehyde is selected from formalin (the
      acetal form of formaldehyde gas in water), acetaldehyde,
      propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde
      (pentanal), capronaldehyde (hexanal), trimethylacetaldehyde (pivic
      aldehyde) and isovaleraldehyde (3-methylbutanal).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In another preferred embodiment of the first embodiment,
      the composition for repelling an elasmobranch comprises a natural
      aldehyde. In a more preferred embodiment, the natural aldehyde is
      selected from cinnimaldehyde, cuminaldehyde and acetaldehyde. In a
      more preferred embodiment, the natural aldehyde is piperonal.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In another alternative preferred embodiment of the first
      embodiment, the composition for repelling an elasmobranch
      comprises an aromatic aldehyde, solubilized in a suitable polar
      solvent. In a more preferred embodiment, the aromatic aldehyde is
      selected from one or more methoxybenzaldehydes and a tolualdehyde.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In an alternative preferred non-limiting embodiment, the
      composition comprises a combination of two or more aldehydes or
      aldehyde derivatives.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] According to a second non-limiting embodiment of the
      present invention, a composition for repelling an elasmobranch is
      provided comprising a carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof. In
      a preferred non-limiting embodiment, the composition comprises
      butyric acid. In another preferred non-limiting embodiment, the
      composition comprises citric acid. In other preferred non-limiting
      embodiments, the carboxylic acid is selected from trans-cinnamic
      acid, 2-butenoic acid, lactic acid, 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid,
      2,3,3-trimethylproprionic acid, 2-ethylbutyric acid, 2-ketobutyric
      acid, 3-aminobutyric acid, 4-acetylbutyric acid, 3-butenoic acid,
      tricarballylic acid and hydroxysuccinic acid. In an alternative
      preferred non-limiting embodiment, the composition comprises a

      elasmobranch can remain in this state for up to 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>I. COMPOSITIONS FOR REPELLING ELASMOBRANCH</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0033] The elasmobranch repellent activity of aldehydes,
      carboxylic acids, ketones, diketones, pyridines or antipyrines has
      been demonstrated in eight species of elasmobranch. Tests
      demonstrate the repelling compounds are correlated with a flight
      response in elasmobranchs wherein the flight response is
      correlated with stimulation of elasmobranch taste receptors with
      the repelling compounds. As such, these compounds were effective
      as elasmobranch repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Flight responses upon exposure to the repelling compounds
      disclosed herein have been observed in bioassays of eight
      different species across two different orders of elasmobranch and
      three different families of elasmobranch including lemon sharks of
      various sizes and ages (N. brevirostris, Order Carcharhiniformes,
      Family Carcarhinidae), nurse sharks of various sizes and ages (C.
      cirratum, Order Orectolobiformes, Family Ginglymostomatidae),
      tiger sharks of various sizes and ages (G. cuvieri, Order
      Carcharhiniformes, Family Carcarhinidae) blacktip sharks of
      various sizes and ages (C. limbatus Order Carcharhiniformes),
      blacknose sharks of various sizes and ages (C. acronotus, Order
      Carcharhiniformes, Family Carcarhinidae), Caribbean reef sharks of
      various sizes and ages (C. perezii, Order Carcharhiniformes,
      Family Carcarhinidae), great hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna mokarran,
      Order Carcharhiniformes, Family Sphyrnidae), and blue sharks
      (Prionace glauca, Order Carcharhiniformes, Family Carcarhinidae).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Among the above-listed species, flight responses have
      repeatedly been observed upon exposure to a wide variety of
      different aldehydes or combinations of aldehydes from one to ten
      carbons in length; including methylbutanals, methylbutenals,
      linear five-carbon aldehydes, saturated one-to-six carbon
      aldehydes, unsaturated two-to-six carbon aldehydes, natural
      aldehydes, aromatic aldehydes, piperonal and combinations of
      aldehydes. Aldehydes and there derivatives are disclosed herein as
      effective elasmobranch repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Flight responses have likewise repeatedly been observed in
      elasmobranchs upon exposure to an extensive variety of carboxylic
      acids or combinations of carboxylic acids, including butyric acid,
      citric acid, crotonic acid and mixtures of crotonic acid, cinnamic
      acid and maleic acid, and crotonic acid, citric acid and fumaric
      acid. Carboxylic acids and their derivatives are disclosed herein
      as effective elasmobranch repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Flight responses have likewise repeatedly been observed in
      elasmobranchs upon exposure to ketones such as ionone and
      zingerone. Ketones and their derivatives are disclosed herein as
      effective elasmobranch repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Flight responses have also been observed in elasmobranchs
      upon exposure to diketones, such as 2,3-butanedione (diacetyl).
      Diketones and their derivatives are disclosed herein as effective
      elasmobranch repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Flight responses have likewise repeatedly been observed
      upon exposure to pyridine and pyridine derivatives such as
      3-methylpyridine, 2-amino-3-picoline and upon exposure to
      anti-pyrines and derivatives thereof, such as 4-aminoantipyrine
      and antipyrine solutions. See Tables 25-26. Pyridines and their
      derivatives and anti-pyrines and their derivatives are disclosed
      herein as effective elasmobranch repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Surprisingly, fish appear unresponsive to these
      shark-repelling aldehydes. Tests involving captive Cobia and
      Yellowfin Tuna show that feeding behavior is actually slightly
      increased in the presence of aldehydes, particularly
      3-methylbutanal, a potent shark gustatory repellent. Similarly,
      teleost reef fish, such as Triggerfish and Snappers, have been
      observed feeding and swimming in a cloud of shark-repelling
      aldehydes. This behavior is presumed to result from the lack of
      aldehyde-receptors in the fishes' gustatory system. Interestingly,
      aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH, ALDH2) have been found in certain
      species of fish.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In open water tests, the Queen triggerfish (Ballistes
      vetula), Durgeon Triggerfish (Melichthys niger), Bermuda Chub
      (Kyphosus sectatrix), Yellowtail Snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) and
      Remora (Remora remora) were observed to be unaffected by exposure
      to elasmobranch repellents in numerous tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Flight responses, or repellency activity, may be
      demonstrated in any method described herein or known to one of
      skill in the art. Flight responses have been observed and measured
      using several bioassays known in the art to correlate with flight
      response.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] One bioassay used to observe and measure flight response is
      the tonic immobility test. Tonic immobility is a state of
      paralysis that typically occurs when a shark is subject to
      inversion of its body along the longitudinal axis. This state is
      called "tonic," and the shark can remain in this state for up to
      15 minutes thereby allowing researchers to observe effects of
      chemical repellents. The "tonic" state of the shark is first
      established by releasing seawater in proximity to the "tonic"
      shark with the same delivery instrument and at the same distance
      as a "test" repellent compound will be released. Some controls are
      released with a high flow rate (30 mL/sec) in order to establish
      that sharks are not awakened by a jet of fluid over their noses.
      Once behavioral controls are established, a compound or
      composition that may have a repelling effect is delivered to the
      shark. If the compound or composition engenders a flight response,
      the shark will awaken from the tonic state and rapidly attempt to
      flee the delivered repellent. Using this tonic immobility bioassay
      researches can quantify the strength of a repellent effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In the tonic immobility studies disclosed herein, several
      different methods were employed for delivery of repelling
      compounds. A first method for delivery of chemical repellent in
      tonic immobility studies employed a "Syringe 3/5/10 Assay" method.
      The "Syringe 3/5/10 Assay" method is so named because a test
      repellent is delivered to a shark from a distance of about "3"
      inches with a bolus of about "5" mL with a response to the test
      repellent considered positive if the shark reacts with a change in
      behavior within less than about "10" seconds from the time of
      delivery.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The "3/5/10 Syringe Assay" as employed herein delivered a
      dose of 5-6 mL of a test chemical repellent from a syringe fixed
      with a needle having a gauge of about 22 from a distance at least
      3 inches in front of a shark. Because the test chemical repellent
      was delivered at a distance from the shark's nares and mouth, a
      cloud of test chemical repellent was dispersed over the shark
      within the water column. The dispersed test repellent was subject
      to water current direction, dispersion and dilution. As a result,
      a flight response within 10 seconds was considered a positive
      repellency response. Time from delivery of the test substance
      until a response was observed, measured and recorded. Time from
      delivery to response is related to the size of the bolus delivered
      from the syringe, distance of the shark from the syringe and water
      current. As such, a longer time to response does not reflect
      reduced potency for a particular compound. To the contrary, a
      longer time to response as compared to some other compound or test
      simply demonstrates potency even after a cloud of repellent has
      traveled some distance against water current.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] A second delivery method called the "Syringe Assay" method
      delivered a dose of 60 mL or more of a test chemical repellent
      from at least one foot, and up to as many as five feet, from a
      shark. The distance of delivery was determined based on the
      strength of the water current in the direction of the shark. Time
      from delivery of the test substance until response was observed,
      measured and recorded. The "Syringe" method allows a researcher to
      observe how a diffusing and diluting cloud of test chemical
      repellent affects the shark's behavior when the shark encounters
      the delivered cloud of test substance. The "Syringe" method
      requires relatively large doses because of the diffusion of the
      cloud over time and distance. Time from delivery to response is
      related to the size of the bolus delivered from the syringe,
      distance of the shark from the syringe and water current. As such,
      a longer time to response does not reflect reduced potency for a
      particular compound, as discussed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] A third method of delivery was called the "Bite Assay." In
      this method of delivery, a dose of typically less than 5 mL was
      presented directly into a shark's mouth using a pipette.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A fourth method of delivery was called the "Micropipette
      Assay" method of delivery. In this method, a very small dose
      (fraction of a mL) of a test substance was delivered directly into
      a shark's mouth. The Micropipette Assay did not consistently
      terminate tonic immobility in most chemical tests. A response,
      such as a cough or other notable action of the shark, was usually
      noted when effective gustatory repellents were delivered directly
      into a shark's mouth while in tonic immobility.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The Micropipette Assay method has not proven to be a
      particularly effective method of assaying for a flight response in
      elasmobranchs. The Micropipette Assay method is, nevertheless, an
      excellent method for specifying that a gustatory response has
      occurred. It is effective for specifying a gustatory response
      because the micropipette delivery method allows direct delivery of
      an entire bolus of test substance into the mouth of the shark
      being tested. A combination of data from micropipette assays
      demonstrating a gustatory response and other assays demonstrating
      a flight response is an excellent combination of data
      demonstrating both the repellent activity of a compound and its
      effectiveness as a gustatory repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Another bioassay used to observe a flight response in
      sharks is a free-swimming test using a small metal cage containing
      bait. This assay is referred to as a "Cage Assay." The cage with
      bait is suspended below a float in the water column. A [3/8] inch
      diptube is secured from the cage to the boat and carried chemical
      compounds to the proximity of the cage where the test substances
      were delivered. Sharks are drawn to the vicinity of the boat with
      chum. Sharks are observed to immediately bump and bite at the cage
      wherein bait was contained. The number of interactions between the
      sharks and the cage are recorded over time. Test chemical
      repelling substance is delivered to the vicinity of the cage
      through the diptube. The frequency of bumps and strikes by sharks
      against the cage is then monitored and recorded. If bumps and
      strikes by sharks cease for a period of time, that time period is
      also recorded. In the free-swim ring tests disclosed herein using
      a baited cage, the volume of test chemical repellent delivered
      into the vicinity of the cage was about 500 mL.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Another bioassay used to observe a flight response in
      sharks is a cloud dispersion assay on competitively feeding
      population of sharks. This assay is referred to as a "Cloud
      Dispersion Assay" or "Cloud Assay." A pressurized fluid delivery
      system was designed to deliver repellent into large feeding
      populations of sharks. The repellent is released as a subsurface
      cloud, which follows the current. A 1 L plastic container
      containing the test chemical repellent solution is pressurized to
      approximately 20 psig with a battery compressor or hand pump. A
      globe valve is used to hold back the fluid. The fluid is delivered
      to the end of a long PVC pole using a Teflon tubing. This allows
      the operator to place the tip of the pole well into a population
      of feeding sharks. By actuating the small globe valve, a cloud of
      the chemical solution is released quickly and reliably into the
      feeding population. Controls are established using FD&amp;C Red 40
      dye and seawater, uncolored seawater, and air. These controls
      establish that sharks are not afraid to approach the delivery
      pole, nor are sharks deterred from feeding by the jet of control
      fluid or air.<br>
      <br>
      A. Composition for Repelling Elasmobranchs Via Gustatory Receptors<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Compositions for repelling an elasmobranch via said
      elasmobranch's gustatory receptors are disclosed herein. Gustatory
      repellent compositions may comprise an aldehyde or a derivative
      thereof, a carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, a ketone or
      derivative thereof, a di-ketone or derivative thereof, a pyridine
      or a derivative thereof or an antipyrine or a derivative thereof,
      or any compound that terminates tonic immobility or otherwise
      evokes a behavioral response when administered to the mouth of an
      elasmobranch in tonic immobility.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The biological activity of a gustatory chemical shark
      repellent differs from olfactory and respiratory repellents. This
      is readily observed using the tonic immobility bioassay. Unlike
      mammals, a shark's "nose" (olfactory system) is isolated from its
      mouth, but its mouth and gills are interrelated.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Using a microliter syringe or microliter pipette, a bolus
      of test chemical can be directed precisely into one of the shark's
      nares, or its mouth. Gustatory repellents will terminate tonic
      immobility or evoke a behavioral response from a "tonic" shark
      almost immediately when injected into the mouth of the shark.
      Olfactory repellents will terminate tonic immobility almost
      immediately when injected into a nare of the shark.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Repellents that act upon the respiratory system, such as
      surfactants, saponins, and soaps, are typically introduced in the
      mouth, but a delayed coughing response is observed. The delayed
      response generally occurs after two gill pumps following the
      introduction of the test compound into the shark's mouth.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Gustatory repellent compounds typically will cause the
      shark to lock its mouth wide open, followed by head shaking.
      Respiratory repellent compounds will invoke coughing and violent
      gill pumping responses as the chemical contacts the gill rakes
      through pumping action.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] During chemical repellent tests, a divider may be used to
      control the flow of trace amount of test chemical. A thin strip of
      plastic may be placed between the shark's mouth and nares, to
      minimize any chances that an olfaction substance will enter the
      mouth, or that a gustation compound will enter the nares. While
      the mouth may be separated from the nose in shark investigations,
      there is no way to segregate the gills from the shark's "palate"
      within the mouth. It has been hypothesized that the insertion of
      some kind of internal dam into the mouth might separate the
      "palate" from the gills but it is expected that this would injure
      the animal and, as such, would be an unsatisfactory research
      method.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Gustatory responses have been demonstrated in seven species
      of shark (lemon, nurse, blacktip, tiger, blacknose, Caribbean and
      blue) in a wide range of aldehydes and aldehyde mixtures;
      including methylbutanals, methylbutenals, linear five-carbon
      aldehydes, saturated one-to-six carbon aldehydes, unsaturated
      two-to-six carbon aldehydes, natural aldehydes, aromatic
      aldehydes, aldehydes of up to ten carbons in length and in
      combinations of aldehydes. See Tables 14-23. In Tables 14-23,
      results of tests using aldehyde and combinations of aldehydes on
      different species of elasmobranch are provided. Of particular
      interest for the differentiation of a gustatory response from an
      olfactory response are the tonic immobility assays using a
      micropipette delivery method wherein chemical repellent is
      delivered directly into the mouth of the test shark. A gustatory
      response is positive when tonic immobility is terminated and a
      flight response is observed (denoted under column "T?" as "Y") or
      when a change in shark behavior short of termination of tonic
      immobility is observed, such as a cough (denoted under column "T?"
      as "R"). "N" under column "T?" denotes no response.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Gustatory responses to aldehydes and aldehyde mixtures are
      likewise confirmed in Tables 1-8 using the delivery methods (other
      than "micropipette") that resulted in termination of tonic
      immobility or change of behavior. A review of the data in Tables
      14-23 reveals that delivery of aldehydes or combinations of
      aldehydes directly to the mouth of a shark using a micropipette
      terminated tonic immobility in numerous tests among several
      different species of shark. Delivery of aldehydes or combinations
      of aldehydes directly to the mouth of nurse sharks in bite tests
      likewise resulted in termination of tonic immobility.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] From the data presented herein, it is believed that a
      gustatory response (response based on detection of the repellent
      in the mouth) is different from an olfactory response (a response
      based on detection of the repellent in nares). Of particular
      interest for the differentiation of a gustatory response from an
      olfactory response are tonic immobility assays using a
      micropipette delivery method wherein chemical repellent is
      delivered directly into the mouth of the test shark. A gustatory
      response is positive when tonic immobility is terminated and a
      flight response is observed. See Tables 14-27.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The data in Tables 14-23 evidences that aldehydes stimulate
      gustatory receptors in creating a flight response. Gustatory
      responses have likewise repeatedly been observed upon exposure to
      pyridine and pyridine derivatives such as 3-methylpyridine,
      2-amino-3-picoline as well as upon exposure to 4-aminoantipyrine
      and antipyrine solutions. See Tables 25-26. In Tables 25 and 26,
      results of tests using pyridine and antipyrine derivatives on
      different species of elasmobranch are provided. While delivery of
      about 500 microliters of pyridine from a micropipette directly
      into the mouth of a nurse shark did not evoke a response, "Syringe
      3/5/10" assays and "Hd syringe" assays, which provide a stream of
      test substance to the mouth and nares of a shark, predominantly
      terminated tonic immobility. Delivery of 400 microliters of
      antipyrine solution from a micropipette evoked a response in one
      assay and did not evoke a response in another. "Hd Syringe"
      assays, which direct a precise bolus of test substance to the
      mouth and nose of a shark, with 4-aminoantipyrine terminated tonic
      immobility in all tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The data in Tables 25-26 evidence that pyridines and
      pyridine derivatives and antipyrines and antipyrine derivatives
      stimulate gustatory receptors in creating a flight response. The
      data in Table 27 and Example 5 evidence that ketones and
      di-ketones simulate gustatory receptors in creating a flight
      response.<br>
      <br>
      B. Composition for Repelling Elasmobranchs Comprising Aldehydes<br>
      <br>
      [0063] A composition for repelling an elasmobranch may comprise an
      aldehyde or a derivative thereof. Tables 1-7 and examples 1-8 and
      12 provide data evidencing repeated observation of flight
      responses among seven species of elasmobranch upon exposure to
      more than twenty different aldehydes or combinations of aldehydes
      from one to ten carbons in length; including methylbutanals,
      methylbutenals, linear five-carbon aldehydes, saturated one-to-six
      carbon aldehydes, unsaturated two-to-six carbon aldehydes, natural
      aldehydes, aromatic aldehydes and combinations of aldehydes.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Exemplary and non-limiting aldehydes disclosed herein as
      elasmobranch repellents include, and are not limited to,
      3-methylbutanal, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutenal,
      2-methylbutenal, valeraldehyde, trans-pentenal, propionaldehyde,
      butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, capronaldehyde (hexanal),
      trimethylacetaldehyde (pivaldehyde or pivic aldehyde),
      trans-cinimaldehyde, cuminaldehyde, piperonal,
      methoxybenzaldehydes, vanillin, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde
      (diethylacetaldehyde), iso-butyraldehyde
      (2-methylpropionaldehyde), heptanal (heptyl aldehyde), octanal
      (octyl aldehyde), nonanal (nonyl aldehyde), decanal (decyl
      aldehyde), dimethylbenzaldehydes, o-anisaldehyde, m-anisaldehyde
      and p-anisaldehyde.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In general, the aldehyde function appears to be a
      tremendously powerful gustatory compound. In humans, aldehydes
      such as cuminal invoke spicy flavors, e.g., benzaldhyde
      (cherries), piperonal (black cherries), cinnimal (hot cinnamon),
      etc. However, in a shark, these receptors, if they exist, may
      invoke entirely different sensations. It is reasonable to expect
      that a shark would never encounter a free-aldehyde in the ocean,
      particularly aldehydes of C2-C6, and therefore would find them
      distasteful.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Most aldehydes having carbon chains of more than four
      carbons are not water soluble. In these cases, denatured alcohol
      may be used to solubilize the aldehyde. A preferred solvent may be
      a mixture of methanol and ethanol. A more preferred solvent may be
      a 50% w/w mixture of methanol and ethanol, denatured ethanol, or
      diethylene glycol monoethyl ether.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The electrophilic carbonyl function of the aldehyde makes
      it fairly reactive. If the aldehyde is soluble enough in seawater,
      which is slightly basic, cyclic addition products may be
      reversibly formed. These products are called "cyclic acetals" or
      simply "acetals." Because acetyls of the aldehydes disclosed
      herein likely form when the aldehydes are exposed to water,
      acetals of the aldehydes disclosed herein are also expected to
      play a role in gustatory repelling of elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] 1. Methylbutanals<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Methylbutanals may be administered to elasmobranchs as a
      repellent, including methylbutanal or any derivative thereof.
      Excellent gustatory repellent activity has been observed in
      3-methylbutanal and 2-methylbutanal as demonstrated in Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      [0070] Table 1, which summarizes the data in Tables 14 and 15,
      evidences the gustatory repellent characteristics of
      methylbutanals. In 35 of 36 assays (combining columns "Y" and "R"
      under the column labeled "Total (Not including Micropipette
      Assays)" to arrive at a 97% effectiveness rate), including assays
      on lemon, nurse, tiger and blacktip sharks, the gustatory
      repellent activity of 3-methylbutanal was established. In 81% of
      assays, tonic immobility was fully terminated. Termination of
      tonic immobility demonstrates a flight response and good repellent
      activity. In 17% of assays, a behavioral change was observed in
      the shark being tested even though the shark remained paralyzed in
      tonic immobility. In only a single assay did a shark not respond
      to treatment with 3-methylbutanal.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In five of five assays for repellent effect of
      2-methylbutanal in lemon and nurse sharks, tonic immobility was
      terminated with as little as 200 microliters of repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Together the data in Table 1 evidence the effectiveness of
      methylbutanals as elasmobranch repellents. The acetyls of the
      methylbutanals that are created when the methylbutanals are
      exposed to water are also expected to play a role in the repellent
      activity of the methylbutanals. Methylbutanals may be administered
      into the vicinity of an elasmobranch in a method known in the art
      or herein disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The methylbutanal compounds, 3-methylbutanal and
      2-methylbutanal, are preferred elasmobranch repellents because
      they are not prohibited by federal regulations, are easy to
      handle, and provide a very strong repellent response. Other
      derivatives of the methylbutanals including addition products, and
      hydroxy- or amino-substituted methylbutanals are also expected to
      provide good repellent effect because of the hydrogen bonding and
      polarity provided by such groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] 2. Methylbutenals<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Methylbutenals likewise may be administered to
      elasmobranchs as an effective repellent, including methylbutenals
      or any derivative thereof. Excellent repellent activity has been
      observed in 2-methylbutenal and 3-methylbutenal.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0076] Table 2, which summarizes data from Tables 16 and 17,
      evidences the effective repellent characteristics of
      methylbutenals. In four of four trials for 2-methylbutenal (with
      volumes as low as 300 microliters) and in four of four trials for
      3-methylbutenal (with volumes as low as 350 microliters), all
      tests on nurse and lemon sharks terminated tonic immobility. This
      data demonstrates the effective repellent activity of the
      methylbutenals. Additionally, as may be seen in Table 17,
      Micropipette assays demonstrate the gustatory repellent nature of
      the methylbutenals by showing a response to repellent directed
      solely to the mouth and not including the nares. Acetyl
      derivatives of methylbutenals are also expected to play a role in
      the repellent effect of the methylbutenals.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Methylbutenals may be administered into the vicinity of an
      elasmobranch in any method of delivery known in the art or herein
      disclosed. Methylbutenals are preferred elasmobranch repellents
      because they are not prohibited by federal regulations, are easy
      to handle and provide a very strong repellent response.
      Derivatives of methylbutenals including its addition products, and
      hydroxy- or amino-substituted methylbutenals are also expected to
      provide good repellent effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] 3. Linear 5-Carbon Aldehydes<br>
      <br>
      [0079] It is demonstrated herein that aldehydes having a linear
      five carbon chain may be administered to elasmobranchs as a
      particularly effective repellent. Linear five carbon chain
      aldehydes are generally soluble in water and evoke a flight
      response in a wide range of shark species. Five carbon chain
      aldehydes include, methylbutanals or any derivative thereof,
      methylbutenals or any derivative thereof, valeraldehyde or any
      derivative thereof and trans-pentenal or any derivative thereof,
      such as pentenal. Effective repellent activity has been observed
      in each of these compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Table 3, in combination with Tables 1 and 2 above, provides
      data evidencing the gustatory repellent characteristics of linear
      5 carbon aldehydes. As established above methylbutanals and
      methylbutenals are effective elasmobranch repellents. See Tables
      1-2.<br>

      <br>
      [0081] Table 3, which summarizes data in Table 18, provides data
      evidencing the repellent activity of valeraldehyde and
      trans-pentenal. In six of six assays on lemon and nurse sharks
      using valeraldehyde, tonic immobility was terminated. Further, the
      results of micropipette assays in Table 18 using valeraldehyde
      support the conclusion that valeraldehyde is a gustatory repellent
      because all Micropipette assays showed a response by the shark to
      direct delivery of valeraldehyde to the mouth. Additionally, in
      five of five assays, trans-pentenal terminated tonic immobility in
      lemon and nurse sharks. Again, the results of micropipette assays
      in Table 18 support the conclusion that trans-pentenal is an
      effective gustatory repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Together, the data in Tables 1, 2 and 3 establish the
      effectiveness of linear 5 carbon aldehydes as elasmobranch
      repellents. Linear 5 carbon aldehydes may be administered into the
      vicinity of an elasmobranch in any method of delivery known in the
      art or herein disclosed. As such, a composition for repelling an
      elasmobranch comprising a linear 5 carbon aldehyde including
      valeraldehyde or pentenal or trans-pentanal has been provided
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] 4. Saturated C1-C6 Aldehydes<br>
      <br>
      [0084] It is demonstrated herein that aldehydes having a saturated
      carbon chain comprising 1 carbon to about 6 carbons may be
      administered to elasmobranchs as a particularly effective
      repellent. Such aldehydes are generally soluble in water and evoke
      a flight response in a wide range of shark species. Saturated 1
      carbon to 6 carbon aldehydes include, formalin, acetaldehyde,
      proprionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde,
      capronaldehyde, trimethylacetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal or any
      derivative of any of the before-listed compounds. Good repellent
      activity has been observed in each of these compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Table 4, which summarizes data from Tables 14 and 19,
      establishes the repellent activity of saturated C1-C6 aldehydes.<br>

      [0086] As may be seen above, in 100% of assays performed using
      proprionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde,
      capronaldehyde, and trimethylaldehyde, tonic immobility was
      terminated. These tests were done on nurse and lemon sharks. As
      was discussed above and shown in Table 1,3-methylbutanal is an
      excellent gustatory repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The data in Table 4 evidences the utility of aldehydes
      having a saturated carbon chain comprising 1 carbon to about 6
      carbons including propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde,
      isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, capronaldehyde,
      trimethylacetaldehyde and 3-methylbutanal or derivatives of any of
      these compounds. Such aldehydes may be administered into the
      vicinity of an elasmobranch in any method of delivery known in the
      art or herein disclosed. Similarly, formalin and acetaldehyde are
      very water soluble and would be expected to produce similar
      gustation responses as the other C1-C6 aldehydes. As such, a
      composition for repelling an elasmobranch comprising a saturated
      aldehyde with a one to six carbon chain has been provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] 5. Unsaturated C2-C6 Aldehyde<br>
      <br>
      [0089] It is demonstrated herein that aldehydes that are soluble
      in water and have an unsaturated carbon chain of two to six
      carbons may be administered to elasmobranchs as a particularly
      effective repellent. Unsaturated C2-C6 aldehydes include pentenal,
      2-methylbutenal, 3-methyl-butenal, or any derivative of any of the
      before-listed compounds. Excellent repellent activity has been
      observed in each of these compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Table 5 provides data establishing the repellent activity
      of unsaturated C2-C6 aldehydes. The data for pentenal,
      2-methylbutenal and 3-methylbutenal is repeated from Tables 2 and
      3 above.<br>

      [0091] The unsaturated aldehydes crotonaldehyde and acrolein fall
      within the family of unsaturated C2-C6 aldehydes and are also
      expected to act as gustatory repellents. The oxidize form of
      crotonaldehyde (crotonic acid) was shown to act as a gustatory
      repellent. The hydrogenated form of acrolein (propionaldehyde) was
      also shown to act as a gustatory repellent. Nevertheless,
      crotonaldehyde and acrolein are very toxic and are considered
      marine pollutants. As a result, testing of these compounds was not
      considered feasible. Further, while these compounds would be
      considered to be gustatory elasmobranch repellents as evidenced by
      the data contained herein, crotonaldehyde and acrolein are not
      preferred repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The excellent elasmobranch repelling characteristics of
      pentenal, 2-methylbutenal and 3-methylbutenal is illustrated
      above. See Table 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The data in Table 5 evidences the utility of unsaturated
      C2-C6 aldehydes including pentenal, 2-methylbutenal and
      3-methylbutenal. Such aldehydes may be administered into the
      vicinity of an elasmobranch in any method of delivery known in the
      art or herein disclosed. As such, a composition for repelling an
      elasmobranch comprising an unsaturated C2-C6 aldehyde has been
      provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] 6. Natural Aldehydes<br>
      <br>
      [0095] It is demonstrated herein that naturally occurring
      aldehydes such as cinnimaldehyde, cuminaldehyde and piperonal or
      any derivatives of any of the before-listed compounds may be
      administered to elasmobranchs as a particularly effective
      repellent. Table 6 provides data establishing the repellent
      activity of naturally occurring aldehydes.<br>

      [0096] The data in Table 6 evidences the repellent activity of
      naturally occurring aldehydes as elasmobranch repellents including
      cinnimaldehyde, cuminaldehyde and piperonal. In two of two Syringe
      assays for cinnimaldehyde on lemon and nurse sharks and one
      Syringe assay for cuminaldehyde on lemon shark, tonic immobility
      was terminated in each assay. In an individual cage assay for
      piperonal, repellent activity was demonstrated by a decrease in
      the number of strikes by feeding sharks against a baited cage. In
      the piperonal assay, the sharks did not return to the baited cage
      after 10 minutes. In one of four Hd Syringe assays for natural
      aldehydes on nurse sharks, a behavioral change was observed within
      tonic immobility but tonic immobility was not terminated. In three
      of four Hd Syringe assays, no change was observed. The repellent
      activity evidenced in Table 6 should likewise apply to
      acetaldehyde. In view of the data in Table 6, effective
      compositions for repelling an elasmobranch comprising a natural
      aldehyde has been provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] 7. Aromatic Aldehydes<br>
      <br>
      [0098] It is demonstrated herein that aromatic aldehydes such as a
      methoxy/vanillin combination, tolualdehyde, veratraldehyde, or
      anisaldehyde or any derivatives of any of the before-listed
      compounds may be administered to elasmobranchs as a particularly
      effective repellent. Table 7 provides data evidencing the
      repellent activity of aromatic aldehydes.<br>

      <br>
      [0099] Table 7 demonstrates the repellent effect of aromatic
      aldehyde on sharks. In six of nine Syringe Assays for
      methoxy/vanillin aldehyde mixture, tonic immobility was terminated
      among lemon, nurse and blacknose sharks. In two of nine, a
      behavioral change was observed in tonic immobility. In one of
      nine, no change was observed. In a single Syringe Assay for
      tolualdehyde and another for anisaldehyde, tonic immobility was
      terminated in lemons sharks. In six of seven Syringe Assays of
      veratraldehyde, tonic immobility in nurse and lemons sharks was
      observed. In one of seven Syringe Assays no response was noted.
      Such aldehydes may be administered into the vicinity of an
      elasmobranch in any method of delivery known in the art or herein
      disclosed. As such, effective compositions for repelling an
      elasmobranch comprising an aromatic aldehyde have been provided
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] 8. Longer Aldehydes and Combinations of Aldehydes<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Aldehyde combinations or aldehydes having a chain length of
      6 carbons or longer are effective elasmobranch repellents. It is
      demonstrated herein that aldehyde mixtures and aldehydes having a
      carbon chain of six carbons or longer or any derivatives thereof
      may be administered to elasmobranchs to repel them. Table 8
      provides data evidencing the repellent activity of aldehydes with
      carbon chains longer than 6 carbons and combinations of aldehydes.
      Additional data evidencing the repellent activity of combinations
      of aldehydes may be seen in Table 23.<br>

      [0102] Eight-carbon octanal, nine-carbon nonanal, ten-carbon
      decanal and six-carbon mesityl oxide were tested on lemon sharks
      using a Syringe Assay. In each case, tonic immobility was
      terminated. In one Syringe Assay with heptanal, no response was
      observed. In seven of seven Syringe Assay tests for an aldehyde
      combination containing proprional, butanal, isobutanal, pentanal,
      hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, cuminal, cinnimal,
      anisal, mesityl oxide, p-tolualdehyde and veratraldehyde on lemon
      and blacktip sharks, tonic immobility was terminated. In two of
      two Syringe 3/5/10 Assay tests of the aldehyde combination on
      lemon and blacktip sharks, tonic immobility was terminated. In six
      of six Bite Assay tests of the aldehyde combination on nurse
      sharks, tonic immobility was terminated. In only a single
      Micropipette Assay test wherein 500 microliters of aldehyde
      mixture was delivered was no response observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] Table 8 evidences the repellent effect of combinations of
      aldehydes and aldehydes having carbon chains 6 carbons or longer
      on a variety of sharks. Such aldehydes may be administered into
      the vicinity of an elasmobranch in any method of delivery known in
      the art or herein disclosed. As such, compositions for repelling
      an elasmobranch comprising aldehydes of lengths of six carbons and
      greater and combinations of aldehydes have been provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      C. Composition for Repelling Elasmobranchs Comprising Carboxylic
      Acid<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Carboxylic acids or derivatives thereof alone or in
      combinations are disclosed herein as effective elasmobranch
      repellents. Exemplary and non-limiting carboxylic acids include
      n-butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid,
      propanoic acid, citric acid, 2-butenoic acid (crotonic acid),
      3-butenoic acid (cinylacetic acid), trans-cinnamic acid,
      2-hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid,
      1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid (tricarballylic acid),
      hydroxysuccinic acid (di-malic acid), 2,2-dimethylbutyric acid,
      2,3,3-trimethylpropionic acid, 2,3-dimethylbutyric acid,
      2-ethylbutyric acid, 2-ketobutyric acid, 2-methylisovaleric acid,
      3-aminobutyric acid, and 4-acetylebutyric acid. Non-limiting
      exemplary carboxylic acids include dicarboxylic acids and
      tricarboxylic acids. Other naturally occurring acids that repel
      sharks include malic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, fumaric
      acid and tricarballylic acid. These compounds may be used in
      powder (crystalline) form, or in aqueous or polar solvent
      solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Carboxylic acids may be solubilized in any manner known to
      the art for administration into the expected environment of an
      elasmobranch. In a preferred composition, the carboxylic acid is
      prepared at a concentration of 0.1% w/w to 100% w/w in powder or
      liquid form wherein the powder is solubilized in water, ethanol or
      a suitable polar solvent. An exemplary mixture is 20% w/w
      3-butenoic acid, 10% w/w citric acid, and 5% w/w/trancinnamic acid
      solubilized in 50:50 w/w water:ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Carboxylic acids disclosed herein include all carboxylic
      acids having the COOH function of a carboxylic acid. A preferred
      non-limiting class of carboxylic acids includes carboxylic acids
      comprising one to ten carbons. A more preferred non-limiting class
      of carboxylic acids comprises two to about five carbons. Another
      preferred non-limiting class of carboxylic acids comprises the
      dicarboxylic acids. Another preferred non-limiting class of
      carboxylic acids comprises the tricarboxylic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The presence of butyric acid was detected in semiochemical
      extractions of decayed shark tissue using gas chromatography
      coupled with mass spectrometry and NIST structure libraries.
      Semiochemicals from decayed shark tissue have been shown to have
      properties that repel elasmobranchs. When n-butyric acid was
      presented to juvenile lemon or nurse sharks in tonic immobility,
      the immobility was terminated at mouth doses of 100 microliters.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Because n-butyric acid presents a very unpleasant odor
      during handling, its derivatives were studied. Screening of
      derivatives of butyric acid revealed the following compounds as
      repellents in lemon and nurse sharks. 2,2-Dimethylbutyric Acid,
      2,3,3-Trimethylproprionic Acid, 2,3-Dimethylbutyric Acid,
      2-Ethylbutyric Acid, 2-Ketobutyric Acid, 3-Aminobutyric Acid,
      4-Acetylbutyric Acid. Also, compounds having the -enoic form of
      butyric acid were tested revealing the following shark repelling
      compounds: 2-butenoic acid and 3-butenoic acid. Additionally,
      naturally-occurring carboxylic acids were found to have shark
      repelling properties. Other carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid
      combinations were tested. Tables 9 and 10 provide a portion of the
      data of some carboxylic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Table 9 demonstrates the repellent effect of butyric acid,
      butyric acid derivatives, enoic acid derivatives of butyric acid
      and naturally occurring carboxylic acids.<br>

      [0110] In a first Micropipette Assay on a juvenile lemon shark, an
      oral dose of no more than 100 microliters of butyric acid
      terminated tonic immobility. An oral dose of no more than 400
      microliters was then delivered by micropipette into the mouth of a
      juvenile nurse shark. Tonic immobility was terminated. For each
      derivative of butyric acid and each naturally occurring acid
      listed in Table 9, a first micropipette assay was performed on a
      juvenile lemon shark with no more than 100 microliters of test
      acid in an oral dose. A second micropipette assay was then
      performed on a juvenile nurse shark with no more than 400
      microliters of test acid in an oral dose. In each test, tonic
      immobility was terminated. This data evidences the gustatory
      repelling activity of carboxylic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] In four of four Hd Syringe assays, citric acid between 0.3
      mL and 2.4 mL of citric acid 50% w/w was delivered about three
      inches from the mouth of a lemon shark. Each assay terminated
      tonic immobility. Seven Syringe 3/5/10 assays on nurse and lemons
      sharks were employed with crotonic acid solution. In four of the
      seven assays the crotonic acid was delivered directly to the mouth
      on a longline or within 10 inches of the shark's mouth. Tonic
      immobility was terminated. In one of the seven assays, the
      crotonic acid was delivered directly to the mouth of the shark on
      a longline and a behavioral response was observed in tonic
      immobility. In two of the seven assays, 6 mL of crotonic acid was
      delivered to lemon sharks at a distance of 36 inches from the
      shark's mouth. No response was observed. The lack of response is
      explained by the small volume delivered at a very large distance.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The data in Table 9 evidences the broad repellent activity
      of carboxylic acids and the exemplary and non-limiting repellent
      activity of butyric acid, butyric acid derivatives, enoic acids
      and naturally occurring carboxylic acids. Table 10 additionally
      evidences the repellent effect of lactic acid and carboxylic acid
      combinations.<br>

      <br>
      [0113] In two of three Syringe 3/5/10 assays, lactic acid was
      delivered to lemon sharks and terminated tonic immobility. In a
      single Syringe 3/5/10 assay, lactic acid was delivered to a lemon
      shark and no behavioral change was observed. In three of four
      Syringe 3/5/10 assays, a mixture of Crotonic, Cinnamic and Maleic
      acids in glycol were delivered to tiger and blacknose sharks and
      terminated tonic immobility. In one of four Syringe 3/5/10 assays,
      delivery of the repellent actually missed the mouth of the shark
      and only a behavior change was seen in tonic immobility.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] In a cloud dispersal assay of a mixture of Crotonic,
      Cinnamic and Maleic acids, 400 ml was dispersed from a diptube
      near the mouth of a great hammerhead shark. The shark fled the
      area and did not return.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] In a surrounding cloud dispersal assay, 500 mL of a mixture
      of 20% w/w Crotonic acid, 10% w/w Citric acid and 5% w/w Cinnamic
      acid solubilized in 50:50 w/w water:ethanol was delivered in a
      subsurface dose in the vicinity of a population of competitively
      feeding sharks (5 Caribbean reef sharks and 2 blacknose sharks).
      The sharks were dispersed and did not return.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] The data in Table 10 further evidences the broad repellent
      activity of carboxylic acids and mixtures of carboxylic acids.
      Together, Tables 9 and 10 evidence that carboxylic acids may be
      delivered into the vicinity of an elasmobranch in any method of
      delivery known in the art or herein disclosed to repel
      elasmobranchs. As such, a composition for repelling an
      elasmobranch comprising a carboxylic acid and derivatives thereof
      has been provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The composition for repelling an elasmobranch may comprise
      any carboxylic acid. It may preferably comprise a butyric acid,
      citric acid, a trans-cinnamic acid, 2-butenoic acid, lactic acid,
      2,2-dimethylbutyric acid, 2,3,3-trimethylproprionic acid,
      2-ethylbutyric acid, 2-detobutyric acid, 3-aminobutyric acid,
      4-acetylbutyric acid, 3-butenoic acid, tricarballylic acid,
      hydroxysuccinic acid or any carboxylic acid that is deliverable to
      the environment of an elasmobranch, for example soluble in water
      or dissolved in a vehicle for delivery prior to delivery.<br>
      <br>
      D. Composition for Repelling Elasmobranchs Comprising a Ketone or
      Di-Ketone<br>
      <br>
      [0118] A composition for repelling an elasmobranch is provided
      herein comprising a ketone or a derivative thereof including, for
      example, ionone or zingerone, or a di-ketone or a derivative
      thereof, including, for example, 2,3-butanedione. Repelling
      characteristics of ketones and their derivatives and di-ketones
      and their derivatives are provided herein. Table 11 evidences the
      repellent activity of ketones and their derivatives and di-ketones
      and their derivatives.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] Exemplary, non-limiting ketones and derivatives thereof
      include ionone, zingerone and derivatives thereof. Exemplary,
      non-limiting di-ketones and derivatives thereof include
      2,3-butanedione, glyoxal and methylglyoxal. Data in Table 11
      demonstrates the gustatory repellent activity of ketones and
      di-ketones.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] In two individual cage assays for ionone and zingerone,
      repellent activity was demonstrated by a decrease in the number of
      strikes by feeding sharks against a baited cage. In both the
      ionone and zingerone assays, a decrease in the number of strikes
      at the cage was recorded when 500 mL of the repellent was
      delivered to the competitively feeding sharks. After a lull in
      feeding for 10 minutes, the sharks returned to the baited cage.
      See Example 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Tonic immobility studies were carried out on
      2,3-butanedione and 2,3 butanedione (diacetyl) in denatured
      ethanol solution. In seven of eight Syringe Assays, tonic
      immobility was terminated in juvenile lemon and nurse sharks. In
      one Syringe Assay, a behavioral response was noted during tonic
      immobility. In one cloud dispersion assay in free-swimming
      Caribbean reef and blacknose sharks, no response was noted since
      the volume was only 290 microliters. No response would be expected
      with such a low volume. In one bite assay with a juvenile nurse
      shark, tonic immobility was terminated.<br>

      [0122] The data in Table 11 evidences the gustatory repellent
      activity of ketones, such as ionone and zingerone, and di-ketones,
      such as 2,3-butanedione. Other ketones having demonstrated
      gustatory repellent activity would include glyoxal and
      methylglyoxal.<br>
      <br>
      E. Composition for Repelling Elasmobranchs Comprising a Pyridine<br>
      <br>
      [0123] A composition for repelling an elasmobranch is provided
      herein comprising a pyridine or a derivative thereof including
      2-methylpyridine (alpha-picoline, 3-methylpyridine
      (beta-picoline), 4-methylpyridine (gamma-picoline), lutidine
      (dimethylpyridine), and isomers of lutidine, collidine
      (trimethylpyridine) and isomers of collidine, 2-amino-3-picoline
      and derivatives of each or all of the pyridine derivatives.
      Repelling characteristics of pyridine and its derivatives are
      provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] In initial investigations using tonic immobility assays in
      juvenile sharks, pyridine, alpha-picoline (2-methylpyridine),
      beta-picoline (3-methylpyridine), gamma-picoline
      (4-methylpyridine), lutidine and isomers thereof, collidine
      (trimethylpyridine) and isomers thereof and 3-amino-2-picoline all
      terminated tonic immobility when introduced to the mouth using a
      micropipette or syringe.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Table 12 provides some additional data demonstrating the
      repellent effect of pyridines and its derivatives in further
      investigations.<br>

      &nbsp; "N" denotes no response.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] In three of four Syringe 3/5/10 assays, pyridine was
      delivered to nurse and lemon sharks and terminated tonic
      immobility. In one of four Syringe 3/5/10 assays, delivery of
      pyridine evoke a change in behavior within tonic immobility of a
      nurse shark. In three of three Hd Syringe assays, delivery of
      3-methylpyridine resulted in termination of tonic immobility. In
      two of two Micropipette assays on 2-amino-3-picoline 95%
      behavioral responses were noted in lemons sharks. In one, tonic
      immobility was terminated. In another, a violent seizure in the
      shark in response to the assay rendered measurement impossible.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Together the data in Table 12 demonstrate that pyridine and
      its derivatives such as 3-methylpyridine are good elasmobranch
      repellents. Pyridine is a simple heterocyclic aromatic organic
      compound that is structurally related to benzene, with one CH
      group in the six-membered ring replaced by a nitrogen atom.
      Pyridine has an equatorial lone pair of electrons at the nitrogen
      atom that does not participate in the aromatic pi-system. This
      makes pyridine a basic compound as well as a nucleophile. Pyridine
      is completely miscible in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The addition of one methyl group to the pyridine ring has
      no appreciable reduction on miscibility, particularly in seawater.
      Methylpyridines are commonly called "picolines." Methyl groups may
      occur at the [alpha], [beta], [gamma] positions relative to the
      nitrogen:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0129] It was not considered necessary to test all isomers because
      in a shark, isomers would not be expected to have steric effects
      that would alter the bioactivity of the compound since there are
      no electrophilic reactions occurring. As long as the compound is
      miscible or soluble in seawater, it is expected that it will find
      its way to a gustatory receptor site and activate it.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Two methyl functions on the pyridine ring have slight
      reduction on miscibility, particularly in seawater.
      Dimethylpyridines are commonly called "lutidines." Dimethylation
      may occur in the following positions:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0131] As discussed above, it was not considered necessary to test
      all isomers because in a shark, isomers would not be expected to
      have steric effects that would alter the bioactivity of the
      compound since there are no electrophilic reactions occurring.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Likewise, addition of three methyl functions to the
      pyridine ring has an appreciable reduction on miscibility,
      particularly in seawater. This compound is now only partially
      miscible, but is still bioactive. Trimethylpyridines are commonly
      called "collidines." Trimethyl functions may occur at the
      following positions:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Toxicity is slightly reduced as methylation increases.
      Pyridine itself is not a preferred repellent because pyridine is a
      carcinogen and considered a marine pollutant. Likewise, picolines
      are less preferred repellents because they are irritants (making
      handling difficult) and are suspected carcinogens. While
      collidines may be the least irritative of all the methylpyridines,
      their toxicity decreases their preferability. Nevertheless, the
      repellent activity of these compounds is clearly disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] It is reasonable to expect that alkyl, alkenyl, amino,
      hydroxyl, nitro, and halo-functions on the pyridine ring are
      useful gustatory repellents as well. For example, aminopicoline
      exhibited violent responses in juvenile sharks in the tonic
      immobility assay. Once again, however, the toxicity of this
      compound makes it less preferred from a handling, storage, and
      environmental standpoint.<br>
      <br>
      F. Composition for Repelling Elasmobranchs Comprising an
      Anti-Pyrine<br>
      <br>
      [0135] A composition for repelling an elasmobranch is provided
      herein comprising an anti-pyrine or a derivative thereof including
      anti-pyrine (phenazone) or 4-amino-antipyrine (metapirazone).
      Table 13 provides data evidencing the repellent activity of the
      anti-pyrines. In five of five Hd Syringe assays,
      4-amino-antipyrine terminated tonic immobility in lemon and nurse
      sharks. Additionally, the data from two Micropipette assays
      demonstrate that antipyrine is a gustatory repellent. See Table
      26.<br>

      G. Composition for Repelling Elasmobranchs Comprising a
      Combination of Elasmobranch Repellents<br>
      <br>
      [0136] A composition for repelling an elasmobranch is provided
      herein comprising a combination of two or more of aldehydes or
      derivatives thereof, carboxylic acids or derivatives thereof,
      ketones or derivatives thereof, diketones or derivatives thereof,
      pyridines or derivatives thereof or antipyrines or derivatives
      thereof. It is expected that a combination of respective gustatory
      repellents will act together as a repellent composition. A
      composition may comprise a combination of any elasmobranch
      repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] For example, an effective elasmobranch repellent
      composition may comprise a number of aldehydes. See, e.g., Example
      8, aldehyde repellent composition "BA1." A repellent composition
      may also, for example, comprise aldehydes and a di-ketone. A
      non-limiting preferred combination of aldehydes and a di-ketone
      may comprise butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, veratraldehyde and
      2,3-butanedione. See Example 8, aldehyde repellent composition
      "BA3." Likewise, a repellent composition may comprise, for
      example, a combination of crotonic acid, citric acid and fumaric
      acid, or a combination of crotonic acid, cinnamic acid and maleic
      acid. See Table 24. Each of these combinations, along with a
      variety of other combinations disclosed herein, evidence repellent
      characteristics. See, e.g., Tables 23-24.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] The data in Examples 8 and 9 and Tables 23 and 24, together
      with the disclosure provided herein, evidence the effectiveness of
      combinations of elasmobranch repellents as elasmobranch repellent
      compositions.<br>
      <br>
      H. A Method of Manufacturing an Elasmobranch Repellent<br>
      <br>
      [0139] The repellents and methods describe herein provide the
      artisan with chemicals that have been demonstrated to repel, at
      very low concentrations, families of shark known to migrate in
      shallow coastal waters and species known to attack humans. As
      such, one of skill in the art will recognize from the breadth of
      repellents disclosed herein that an elasmobranch repellent may be
      manufactured by combining an aldehyde or a derivative thereof, a
      carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, a ketone or a derivative
      thereof, a di-ketone or a derivative thereof, a pyridine or a
      derivative thereof, or an antipyrine or a derivative thereof,
      separately or in combination, with an acceptable solvent, carrier,
      diluent or other vehicle for administration or storage. An
      exemplary solvent is ethanol or ethanol:water (50:50 w/w). Ethanol
      and water are excellent solvents for elasmobranch repellents
      because they are not prohibited by federal regulations from
      dispersion in sea water. Other exemplary solvents include
      acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), denatured alcohol, C3-C4
      glycols (2,3-propanediol, butanediol), glycol ethers (diethylene
      glycol monoethyl ether), and glycol ether esters.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] An elasmobranch repellent may also be manufactured by
      crystallizing any of the above-discussed compounds and preparing
      them as a powder to be dispensed into water. Powdered substances
      may be combined with carriers to improve solubility or handling.
      One skilled in the art would recognize many different carriers or
      diluents that may be combined with a powder of any of the
      repellents discussed herein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>III. METHODS AND DEVICES OF DELIVERY OF REPELLENT</b><br>
      <br>
      [0141] A. Method for Repelling Elasmobranch with Gustatory
      Compounds<br>
      <br>
      [0142] Also provided herein is a method of repelling an
      elasmobranch comprising administering a composition for repelling
      an elasmobranch comprising an aldehyde or a derivative thereof, a
      carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, a ketone or a derivative
      thereof, a di-ketone or a derivative thereof, a pyridine or a
      derivative thereof, or an antipyrine or a derivative thereof,
      separately or in combination, in the expected proximity of said
      elasmobranch.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] Any of the repellents disclosed herein may be delivered to
      the environment of an elasmobranch through a variety of methods
      and devices of delivery. These compounds are most useful when they
      can be directed into a shark's mouth or into the environment where
      the repellent may enter the shark's mouth. As such, a squirt gun
      or long syringe is a good delivery vehicle. The repellents
      disclosed herein may likewise be incorporated into lotions,
      longline time-release gels, time-release sponges, jelly's or any
      other delivery device or substance contemplated by one of skill in
      the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] An extensive disclosure of devices for delivery of chemical
      repellents into the vicinity of an elasmobranch is provided in
      PCT/US06/05035. Delivery devices disclosed therein include, e.g.,
      pressurized delivery pole apparatuses, syringes, cattle-treatment
      "drench" guns, aerosol canisters, mortar-launched aerosol "bomb"
      canisters, automated repellent dispensers on a raft or fixed to
      some other object, repellent dischargers, pouches containing
      repellents, apparatuses for administering repellent along fishing
      longline, repellent backpack dischargers for use, for example, by
      scuba divers and those who snorkel, spear guns fitted with a
      repellent discharge device, delivery devices for surfboards,
      wristwatches, belts and bracelets. Each of the devices and
      suggestions for devices disclosed therein may be applied to
      delivery of the compounds disclosed herein. PCT/US06/05035, filed
      Feb. 13, 2006, is incorporated in its entirety herein by
      reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Most aldehydes will oxidize in air. Therefore, it is
      prudent to stabilize the aldehyde when it is stored, especially in
      the warm climates. In a non-limiting preferred handling method,
      the practitioner may use a pinch of hydroquinone or sodium iodide
      with 3-methylbutanal or other aldehyde. The mixture may be stored
      under nitrogen. This method keeps the aldehyde fresh and
      effective. If an aldehyde oxidizes (in the case of 3-methylbutanal
      to becomes isovaleric acid, which smells like feet or cheese) the
      resulting acid may be less potent than the aldehyde.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Many of the gustation compounds disclosed herein are
      regulated under federal environmental regulations. Some are
      considered marine pollutants, and others, like pyridine and
      aminopyridine are considered toxic. However, some, such as
      3-methylbutanal, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutenal,
      2-methylbutenal, trans-pentenal, piperonal, etc., are very safe
      and meet federal regulations.<br>
      <br>
      B. Delivery Devices for Gustatory Compounds<br>
      <br>
      [0147] Alternative methods for delivering a chemical repellent
      into an elasmobranch environment include a miniature pressurized
      repellent gun to be worn on the wrist or ankle, a spear fishing
      gun with an adjacent repellent cylinder, a time release
      sponge-material attached to a surfboard or otherwise placed near a
      diver, swimmer or in some other place of interest, a hollow
      surfboard with a calibrated drip to emit repellent, a pump
      delivery system affixed to a surfboard, a pressurized delivery
      device affixed to a surfboard wherein discharge of repellent may
      be triggered by the surfer, a floatation device, a wristwatch
      filled with repellent (pressurized or unpressurized), a carbon
      dioxide activated pressurized syringe, an aerosol bomb, a
      mortar-launched aerosol bomb, a remote-controlled buoy with a
      repellent tank that may be fired by a lifeguard or other person or
      mechanized system, a buoy with a metering pump that runs during
      swim time (daylight), a repellent pouch attached to longlines
      (muslin/burlap bags) or to clothing or surfboard or other water
      device, jellied repellent (glycol ether/hydroxypropylcelluose gels
      which time-dissolve in water), sunscreen/sun care formulations
      containing repellent, lotions containing repellent, porous fabric
      impregnated with repellent, rechargeable porous fabric impregnated
      with repellent, a kite- or balloon-deployed repellent bomb (remote
      control), a submerged repellent mine (remote control) for deeper
      water, a cattle-treatment drench gun converted to shark repellent
      gun (http://www.dr-register.com/drenchgun.htm),
      repellent-impregnated cable insulation and cable jackets for
      undersea lines.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] Chemical repellents disclosed herein may be discharged
      through a pressurized tube that runs alongside an extended or
      extendable poll. The pressurized delivery pole apparatus may be
      useful for administering repellent to feeding or otherwise
      stimulated sharks. The apparatus may comprise a delivery device
      housing (pole) with a repellent discharge tube housed along or
      within the pole. The repellent discharge tube may be connected to
      a pressurized chamber or chambers containing repellent. The
      delivery device may contain a check valve to facilitate the
      maintenance of pressure. A trigger may allow the pressurized
      repellent to discharge through the tube and away from the pole. An
      alternative delivery device may be a pressurized syringe. Such a
      syringe may be filled with repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] 1. Pressurized Container Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0150] An alternative delivery method may be a pressurized
      container of repellent such as an aerosol canister. The container
      may be constructed of degradable material. The aerosol canister
      may have sufficient pressure and repellent to be discharged in the
      water and repel sharks in the area. The container may be
      asymmetrically weighted to provide an erratic movement in the
      water as it discharges repellent. The aerosol container may
      further comprise an actuator that when engaged allows the
      compressed contents of the aerosol container to be expelled. The
      device further preferably comprises a continuous discharge
      apparatus to allow the contents of the can to be expelled with a
      single activation of the discharge apparatus. Preferably, when the
      actuator is engaged, the nozzle remains open to allow the can to
      be continuously and fully evacuated. The actuator may be made of a
      soluble material that allows discharge when exposed to water.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] 2. Raft/Buoy Delivery Device<br>
      <br>
      [0152] Another delivery device is a raft or other floating or
      fixed device comprising a floating buoy, a solid platform, and a
      container of repellent connected to a pump with a power source
      that is capable of delivering repellent into a shark environment
      either by automatic timing, remote triggering or other actuating
      mechanism. The container comprises a check valve that allows the
      pump to build pressure in the container to a desired pressure.
      When a desired pressure is achieved, a release valve or
      pressure-release cap releases the pressurized repellent into a
      delivery tube. The repellent is expelled across the water,
      spreading a wide cloud of repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] The pump may be automatically activated by a timer or may
      be activated remotely. The pump preferably delivers sufficient
      repellent into the water to repel sharks. Preferably, the
      discharge tube is long enough and not submerged such that when
      delivery begins, the repellent is sprayed a substantial distance
      onto the surface of the water and, under pressure, the discharge
      tube moves erratically across a large radial area in relation to
      the raft. In a preferred method the discharge tube is made of
      flexible material. Preferably the discharge tube will spray over
      an entire 360 degree arc.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] 3. Pouch<br>
      <br>
      [0155] Another delivery device is a pouch containing repellent or
      a sponge treated with repellent. Repellent may be in the form of a
      solution or solid, preferably partly or wholly soluble. The
      repellent may be introduced to the environment of the shark by
      diffusion or by rupturing, tearing or otherwise penetrating the
      pouch. A pouch may also diffuse repellent through its fabric. A
      diffusing pouch may be attached to a fishing net or longline with
      a baited hook on a snood to allow repellent to slowly diffuse into
      the water surrounding bate or fishing net. The pouch will provide
      sufficient repellent around the baited hook to repel sharks while
      not repelling the desired teliost fish. A pouch to be placed on a
      longline may preferably be constructed of muslin or burlap.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] 4. Longline Apparatus<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Sharks represent a significant problem in the long line
      fishing industry. Chemical repellents on longlines in accordance
      with the invention are preferably soluble in seawater, and, at a
      sufficient concentration to produce flight responses in
      elasmobranches. Teleost fish are not affected by the chemical
      repellents.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Another delivery device is an apparatus for administering
      repellent along longline fishing tackle. The apparatus comprises a
      pressurized chamber connected to a source of compressed gas,
      contains repellent and is connected to a primary delivery tube.
      The primary delivery tube is positioned adjacent to or otherwise
      in concert with the longline. Additional secondary delivery tubes
      are joined to the primary delivery tube in proximity to each snood
      of the longline. The secondary delivery tubes terminate near the
      baited hook of the snood. When pressurized repellent is released
      from the chamber, the repellent is delivered along the primary
      delivery tube and into the secondary delivery tubes thereby
      discharging repellent near the baited hook and repelling sharks
      from the bait.<br>
      <br>
      C. Kit for Repelling Elasmobranch<br>
      <br>
      [0159] The skilled artisan will recognize from the disclosure
      herein that a kit may be compiled comprising a composition for
      repelling an elasmobranch comprising an aldehyde or a derivative
      thereof, a carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, a ketone or a
      derivative thereof, a di-ketone or derivative thereof, a pyridine
      or a derivative thereof, or an antipyrine or a derivative thereof
      and a vehicle of administering said repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] In a preferred combination for a kit, the vehicle is
      selected from the group consisting of a pressurized or
      pressurizable delivery device, a pressurized or pressurizable
      repellent gun, a miniature pressurizable repellent gun to be warn
      on a wrist or an ankle of a subject, a spear fishing gun with an
      adjacent pressurizable repellent container, a time release sponge,
      a surfboard, a pump delivery system affixed to a surfboard, a
      pressurized delivery device affixed to a surfboard, a wristwatch
      comprising said repellent, a syringe, a pressurized syringe, an
      aerosol bomb, a mortar-launched aerosol bomb, a remote-controlled
      buoy with a repellent tank, a fixed buoy with a metering pump, a
      repellent pouch, a jelly comprising glycol ether and
      hydroxypropylcelluose, a skin lotion containing said repellent, a
      porous fabric impregnated with repellent, rechargeable porous
      fabric impregnated with said repellent, a submerged repellent
      mine, a repellent-impregnated cable insulation for an undersea
      cable, and a repellent-impregnated cable jacket for an undersea
      cable.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] The invention is further described with the following
      non-limiting examples, which are provided to further illuminate
      aspects of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>IV. EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 1<br>
      Methylbutanal Elasmobranch Repellents<br>
      <br>
      [0162] Tonic immobility studies were carried out on lemon, nurse,
      tiger and blacktip sharks with 3-methylbutanal and 2-methylbutanal
      using Hd Syringe, Syringe 3/5/10 and Bite assays. In 40 of 41
      total assays for repellent effect, tonic immobility was terminated
      or the sharks demonstrated a change of behavior during tonic
      immobility upon delivery of 3-methylbutanal. In Micropipette
      assays, a gustatory response to the deliver of 3-methylbutanal was
      observed in 16 of 20 assays.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] Lemon, nurse, blacktip and tiger sharks were placed in
      tonic immobility by inverting the shark's body along its
      longitudinal axis. Each shark was observed to enter a tonic state
      of paralysis. The "tonic" state of each shark was first
      established by releasing a control of seawater in proximity to the
      shark with the same delivery instrument and at the same distance
      as the chemical repellent would later be delivered. In certain
      controls, sea water was released with a high flow rate (30 mL/sec)
      in order to establish that the sharks would not be awakened by a
      jet of fluid over their noses.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] Once behavioral controls were established, the chemical
      repellent was delivered to the shark using the Hd Syringe Assay
      method, the Syringe 3/5/10 Assay method, the Bite Assay method or
      the Micropipette Assay method. The shark was observed for any
      behavioral response. If tonic immobility was terminated, the
      positive response was denoted as "Y." If tonic immobility was not
      terminated but a behavior change within tonic immobility was
      noted, such as the opening of the mouth or a cough, the response
      was denoted as an "R" for reduced response. If no behavior change
      was observed, the negative response was denoted "N."<br>
      <br>
      [0165] In Hd-Syringe Assays, the 3-methylbutanal was delivered to
      the shark's mouth and nares using a 3 mL hypodermic syringe fitted
      with a 22 gauge needle. The needle was held within 3 inches of the
      shark's mouth and the test repellent was slowly released from the
      syringe with a very fine plume in the water column. Any response
      was denoted. If a response occurred during a measurable time after
      delivery of the test chemical, the time between delivery and
      response was noted. If a response occurred immediately or the
      response occurred before a measurable time could be established,
      no time to response was noted.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] Because the test chemical repellent is delivered at a
      distance from the shark's nares and mouth, a cloud of test
      chemical repellent is dispersed over the shark within the water
      column. The dispersed test repellent is subject to water current
      direction, dispersion and dilution. As a result, the time between
      delivery of the chemical repellent and a response was not
      correlatable with volume of delivered repellent or potency of
      repellent. Instead, the time between delivery and response was
      usually related to water current.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] In Syringe 3/5/10 Assays, 5-6 mL of 3-methylbutanal was
      delivered at least 3 inches in front of the shark's mouth. A cloud
      of the repellent dispersed over the shark within the water column.
      The shark was observed for a behavioral response. A behavioral
      response within 10 seconds was considered a positive flight
      response. Time from delivery of the repellent until behavioral
      response was recorded, if measurable. As noted above, because the
      dispersion of the chemical repellent upon delivery is affected by
      volume of repellent, water current, and other factors, the time
      between delivery and response was not correlatable with the
      potency of the repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] In Bite Assays, a dose of typically less than 5 mL of
      3-methylbutanal was presented directly into the shark's mouth
      using a pipette. The shark was observed for behavioral response as
      above. Because the delivery was directly into the shark's mouth
      and responses were generally observed immediately upon delivery,
      time to response was not recorded.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] Twenty seven Hd Syringe Assays were performed. Eleven
      assays on juvenile lemon sharks, 15 assays on juvenile nurse
      sharks and one assay on a tiger shark. See Table 14. In 74% of
      assays tonic immobility was terminated indicated a flight
      response. In 22% of assays a behavioral change was observed
      indicating a response to the chemical repellent. In one assay no
      response was observed. See Table 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] Seven Syringe 3/5/10 Assays were performed. One assay on a
      juvenile lemon shark, two assays on juvenile nurse sharks, three
      assays on blacktip sharks and one assay on a tiger shark. 100% of
      assays terminated tonic immobility indicating a flight response.
      Two Bite assays were performed on nurse sharks each resulting in
      termination of tonic immobility indicating a flight response. In
      total, 97% of assays resulted in a positive response to
      3-methylbutanal and 81% resulted in direct termination of tonic
      immobility demonstrating a strong repelling effect for
      3-methylbutanal. See Table 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] Twenty Micropipette Assays were performed on juvenile lemon
      sharks and juvenile nurse sharks. In fifteen assays a gustatory
      response was observed (five terminated tonic immobility, ten
      behavioral responses observed). In five assays no response was
      observed. These data demonstrate the gustatory repellent activity
      of 3-methylbutanal because the repellent is delivered directly
      into the mouth of the shark and no repellent is available to the
      nose of the shark. See Table 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] Because Micropipette assays deliver very small volumes into
      the mouth of the shark, the volume of repellent is at times not
      sufficient to evoke termination of tonic immobility and, more
      rarely, is not sufficient to evoke a response. Further because the
      Micropipette assays were often done serially on the same set of
      sharks, second and third doses of the repellent over time would be
      expected to evoke less of a reaction. Nevertheless, the small
      doses delivered to the shark in the Micropipette assay provide
      important data on whether a compound is a gustatory stimulant
      because the small dose may be delivered directly into the mouth of
      the shark. This eliminates any olfactory response that might be
      acting in concert with a gustatory response to terminate tonic
      immobility.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] In each assay disclosed herein, a control of sea water was
      performed prior to the testing of each test repellent. In the
      control, sea water was delivered to the shark to be tested in the
      same delivery manner as the test repellent was delivered. If the
      shark made no response to the delivery of sea water, the control
      was considered successful. Subsequently, the test repellent was
      delivered to the shark. In Cloud Dispersion assays and Cage
      assays, sea water or dye control was delivered to the test shark
      population prior to delivery of repellent.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] Controls were performed in each assay reported herein and
      yielded no response from the subject shark. Control data is not
      illustrated in the data tables provided in this example or
      throughout. Nevertheless, each data point was subject to a control
      prior to the testing of each compound.<br>

      [0178] As evidenced in Tables 16 and 17, methylbutenal is an
      effective elasmobranch repellent because tonic immobility was
      terminated in all test species when an HD Syringe Assay was
      employed and a gustatory response was observed in all Micropipette
      Assays. See Tables 16 and 17.<br>
      <br>
      Example 3-5<br>
      Carbon Aldehyde Elasmobranch Repellents<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Tonic immobility studies were carried out on juvenile lemon
      and nurse sharks using the linear 5-carbon aldehydes,
      valeraldehyde and trans-pentenal with Hd Syringe and Micropipette
      assays as described above in Example 1. One Syringe assay was
      carried out on a juvenile nurse shark.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] In the Syringe assay about 60 mL or more of valeraldehyde
      was delivered from one to as many as five feet from the shark
      depending on the water current. Time from delivery of the test
      substance until a response was observed, measured and recorded.
      Time from delivery to response was related to the size of the
      bolus delivered from the syringe, distance of the shark from the
      syringe and water current. As such, a longer time to response does
      not reflect reduced potency for a particular compound. To the
      contrary, a longer time to response as compared to some other
      compound or test simply demonstrates that even after a cloud of
      repellent has traveled some distance against water current, the
      potency of the repellent is demonstrated.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] Two Hd Syringe assays were performed on juvenile lemon
      sharks with valeraldehyde. Likewise, three Hd Syringe assays were
      performed on juvenile nurse sharks and one Syringe assay was
      performed on a juvenile nurse shark. In all assays valeraldehyde
      terminated tonic immobility demonstrating the repellent activity
      of valeraldehyde. In six of six Micropipette assays (three on
      lemon sharks and three on nurse sharks) a change in behavior
      during tonic immobility was observed. This demonstrates the
      gustatory activity of valeraldehyde. See Table 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] Two Hd Syringe assays were performed on lemon sharks with
      trans-pentenal and three Hd Syringe assays were likewise performed
      on nurse sharks. In all assays tonic immobility was terminated
      demonstrating the repellent activity of valeraldehyde. In six of
      six Micropipette assays (three on lemon sharks and three on nurse
      sharks) a change in behavior during tonic immobility was observed.
      In five of the Micropipette assays tonic immobility was
      terminated. This strongly evidences the gustatory activity of
      trans-pentenal. See Table 18.<br>

      [0183] As evidenced in Table 18, linear 5-carbon aldehydes,
      valeraldehyde and trans-pentenal, were observed to be effective
      elasmobranch repellents in two different species using three
      different assays. In combination with the data provided in Tables
      14-17, the data herein evidences that linear 5-carbon aldehydes
      are effective elasmobranch repellents.<br>
      <br>
      Example 4<br>
      Saturated C1-C6 Aldehyde Elasmobranch Repellents<br>
      <br>
      [0184] Tonic immobility studies were carried out on juvenile lemon
      and nurse sharks using aldehydes with saturated carbon chains
      comprising 3 carbons to about 6 carbons including propionaldehyde,
      butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, capronaldehyde,
      trimethylacetaldehyde. In combination with the study of
      3-methylbutanal and 2-methylbutanal in Example 1 and the study of
      valeraldehyde and trans-pentenal in Example 3, the data provided
      herein evidences the repellent activity of aldehydes with
      saturated carbon chains comprising 3 carbons to about 6 carbons.
      These data may also be applied to the one and two carbon-chain
      compounds formalin and acetaldehyde because they are highly water
      soluble and are expected to exhibit the same bio-activity on
      gustatory receptors as the longer aldehydes.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] Syringe, Hd Syringe, Syringe 3/5/10 and Micropipette assays
      were carried out as described in Examples 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] Using propionaldehyde, a three carbon aldehyde, four
      Syringe assays were performed. Two on nurse sharks and two on
      lemon sharks. All resulted in termination of tonic immobility
      thereby demonstrating the repellent activity of propionaldehyde.
      See Table 19.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] Using butyraldehyde, a four carbon aldehyde, two Syringe
      assays were performed on lemon sharks resulting in termination of
      tonic immobility; three Syringe assays were performed on nurse
      sharks, two resulted in termination of tonic immobility and one
      had no result. Because 4 of 5 assays resulted in termination of
      tonic immobility, the repellent activity of butyraldehyde was
      demonstrated. See Table 19.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] Using isobutyraldehyde, another four carbon aldehyde, three
      Syringe assays were performed on lemon sharks and one Syringe
      assay was performed on a nurse shark. All resulted in termination
      of tonic immobility demonstrating the repellent activity of
      isobutyraldehyde. See Table 19.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Using trimethylacetaldehyde, a five carbon aldehyde, three
      Hd Syringe assays on juvenile nurse sharks, two Hd Syringe assays
      on juvenile lemon sharks and two Syringe 3/5/10 assays on juvenile
      nurse sharks resulted in termination of tonic immobility. The data
      clearly demonstrate the repellent activity of
      trimethylacetaldehyde. See Table 19.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] Micropipette assays using trimethylacetaldehyde resulted in
      a change of behavior during tonic immobility in three juvenile
      nurse sharks and three juvenile lemon sharks. These data
      demonstrate the gustatory effect of trimethylacetaldehyde. See
      Table 19.<br>

      [0191] In combination with the data from Examples 1 and 3, which
      demonstrate the repellent activity of valeraldehyde and
      3-methylbutanal, both five carbon aldehydes, the data demonstrate
      the repellent activity of aldehydes with saturated carbon chains
      comprising 1 to about 6 carbons.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] Tonic immobility studies were carried out using
      diethylacetaldehyde on juvenile lemon, juvenile nurse, blacktip
      and tiger sharks. In six of six Syringe 3/5/10 Assays, tonic
      immobility was terminated in juvenile nurse sharks. In two of four
      Syringe 3/5/10 Assays, tonic immobility was terminated in blacktip
      sharks. In one 3/5/10 Syringe Assay, a behavioral response was
      noted during tonic immobility. In one 3/5/10 Syringe Assay, no
      response was noted. In one 3/5/10 Syringe Assay on a tiger shark,
      tonic immobility was terminated.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] In twelve Hd Syringe Assays on juvenile lemon and nurse
      sharks, a behavioral response during tonic immobility was observed
      in 9 assays. In three assays tonic immobility was fully
      terminated. In eight Micropipette Assays in juvenile lemon and
      nurse sharks a gustatory response was noted with two full
      terminations of tonic immobility. In two Micropipette Assays, no
      response was noted. See Table 20.<br>

      [0194] The data in Table 20 evidences the repellent activity of
      diethylacetaldehyde, further supporting the repellent activity of
      aldehydes with saturated carbon chains comprising 1 to about 6
      carbons.<br>

      Example 5<br>
      Piperonal (Aromatic Aldehyde), Ionone (Ketone) or Zingerone
      (Ketone) Repellents on Free-Swimming Elasmobranchs<br>
      <br>
      [0195] A series of chemical repellent tests on free-swimming
      Caribbean reef sharks (C. perezii) and blacknose sharks (C.
      acronotus) was performed in tropical waters. A small metal cage
      containing bait was suspended below a float in the water column. A
      [3/8]'' ID HDPE diptube was secured from the cage to the boat, so
      that chemical compounds could be transported to the cage's
      proximity. Sharks were stimulated using bunker chum in bags.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] Sharks were observed to immediately bump and bite at the
      cage. The number of interactions was recorded using an underwater
      pole-camera. When 500 mL of 50% w/w piperonal in diethylene glycol
      monoethyl ether was presented, the number of strikes was
      dramatically reduced, and interactions ceased. When 500 mL of 50%
      w/w alpha-ionone in diethylene glycol monoethyl ether was
      presented, the number of strikes was reduced, but interactions
      continued after a 10 minute period. When 500 mL of 50% w/w
      zingerone in diethylene glycol monoethyl ether was presented, the
      number of strikes was reduced, but interactions continued after a
      10 minute period.<br>

      Example 6<br>
      Natural Aldehyde Elasmobranch Repellents<br>
      <br>
      [0197] Tonic immobility studies were carried out on juvenile lemon
      and nurse sharks using natural aldehydes including
      trans-cinnimaldehyde, cuminaldehyde and a combination of natural
      aldehydes. Syringe, and Syringe 3/5/10 assays were carried out as
      described in Examples 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] Two Syringe assays (one on a lemon shark the other on a
      nurse share) using trans-cinnimaldehyde resulted in termination of
      tonic immobility. One Syringe assay on a lemons shark using
      cuminaldehyde resulted in termination of tonic immobility.<br>

      [0199] A combination of natural aldehydes was created from 4.4 g
      cuminaldehyde (cumin) and 5.3 g mixed isomers of anisaldehyde
      (anise) solubilized in 19.8 g denatured ethanol. In one Syringe
      3/5/10 Assay on a juvenile nurse shark, a behavioral response
      within tonic immobility was observed. In three other Syringe
      3/5/10 Assays, no response was observed. See Table 21. In two of
      the negative response assays only 500 microliters of chemical was
      delivered to the shark. This may explain the lack of response. See
      Table 21.<br>

      Example 7<br>
      Aromatic Aldehyde Elasmobranch Repellents<br>
      <br>
      [0201] Tonic immobility studies were carried out on juvenile lemon
      sharks, juvenile nurse sharks and a blacknose shark using aromatic
      aldehydes including a mixture of methoxy/vanillin (containing
      methoxybenzaldehydes and vanillin) and tolualdehyde. Syringe and
      Micropipette assays were carried out as described in Examples 1
      and 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] A methoxybenzaldehyde combination with vanillin was made
      from 2 g Ortho-vanillin, 1 g 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, 1 g
      2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, 1 g 3-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde,
      1 g 2,3,4-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, 1 g 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, 1
      g veratraldehyde, 1 g 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, 1 g
      3-ethoxy-4-hydroxy-benzaldehyde, and 50 g denatured alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] Seven Syringe assays were carried out using the
      methoxy/vanillin repellent combination on lemon sharks, one
      Syringe assay was carried out on a blacknose shark and one Syringe
      assay was carried out on a nurse shark. Five of six assays on
      lemon shark resulted in termination of tonic immobility. One assay
      on a lemon shark resulted in a change in behavior during tonic
      immobility. One assay on a nurse shark had no response. One assay
      on a nurse shark was inconclusive because the shark became ill.
      The assay on the blacknose shark resulted in termination of tonic
      immobility. See Table 22. In six of ten Micropipette assays on
      lemon shark, a response was observed. This demonstrates that
      methoxy/vanillin is a gustatory repellent. See Table 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] Using p-tolualdehyde, one Syringe Assay on a lemon shark
      resulted in termination of tonic immobility. See Table 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0205] Using veratraldehyde, six of six Syringe Assays on lemon
      and nurse sharks resulted in termination of tonic immobility. See
      Table 22. In a single Syringe Assay on a nurse shark no response
      was observed. In eight of twelve Micropipette Assays a gustatory
      response was observed in lemon sharks. In four Micropipette
      assays, no response was observed.<br>

      [0206] Together these data evidence the gustatory repellent
      activity of aromatic aldehydes such as methoxy/vanillin,
      p-tolualdehyde and veratraldehyde.<br>
      <br>
      Example 8<br>
      Longer Aldehydes and Combinations of Aldehydes<br>
      <br>
      [0207] A combination of aldehydes was prepared in about 873 g of
      methanol in the following amounts: butanal 144.22 g; isobutanal
      144.22 g; pentanal 172.26 g; hexanal 200.32 g; decanal 46.884 g;
      cuminal 44.463 g; cinnimal 52.864 g; anisal 68.075 g; mesityl
      oxide 29.445 g; p-tolualdehyde 36.045 g; and veratraldehyde 16.618
      g. The combination was labeled BA1.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] Tonic immobility studies were carried out with the aldehyde
      combination labeled BA1 on juvenile lemon sharks, juvenile nurse
      sharks and blacktip sharks using the above-described aldehyde
      mixture. Syringe, Syringe 3/5/10, Bite and Micropipette assays
      were carried out as described in Examples 1 and 2. In three
      Syringe and six Bite assays on juvenile nurse sharks all assays
      terminated tonic immobility. In three Syringe and one Syringe
      3/5/10 assay on juvenile lemon sharks all assays terminated tonic
      immobility. In one Syringe assay and one Syringe 3/5/10 assay on
      blacktip sharks both resulted in termination of tonic immobility.
      These data demonstrate the excellent repellent activity of the
      above-described mixture of aldehydes. See Table 23.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] In one Micropipette assay in a juvenile lemon shark no
      response was observed. Nevertheless, because the aldehydes that
      have been combined to create the above-described aldehyde mixture
      have demonstrated gustatory stimulation in other Micropipette
      assays, it is concluded that the aldehyde mixture tested here is a
      gustatory repellent. See Table 23.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] In a cloud dispersion assay, a population of competitively
      feed Caribbean reef and blacknose sharks was repelled from the
      feeding zone with a delivery of 500 mL of BA1 repellent
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0211] A combination of aldehydes in the following amounts was
      prepared in about 1294 grams of methanol: proprional 174.24 g;
      butanal 216.33 g; isobutanal 216.33 g; pentanal 172.26 g; hexanal
      100.16 g; heptanal 28.5475 g; octanal 64.11 g; nonanal 35.5625 g;
      decanal 78.14 g; cuminal 74.105 g; cinnimal 66.08 g; anisal 68.075
      g; and mesityl oxide 29.445 g. The combination was labeled BA2.<br>
      <br>
      [0212] Tonic immobility studies were carried out with the aldehyde
      combination labeled BA2 on juvenile lemon sharks using the
      above-described aldehyde combination. Syringe, and Micropipette
      Assays were carried out as described in Examples 1 and 2. Pipette
      Assays were carried out in the same manner as Micropipette Assays
      with delivery of the repellent directly to the mouth except the
      volumes were sometimes larger. In three of four Syringe Assays in
      lemon shark, tonic immobility was terminated. In one Syringe
      Assay, a behavioral change was observed within tonic immobility.
      In four of four Pipette Assays, tonic immobility in lemon sharks
      was terminated. In three Micropipette Assays a gustatory response
      was observed. In three others no response was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0213] A combination of aldehydes and a ketone in the following
      amounts was prepared in 160 grams of denatured alcohol:
      Butyraldehyde 10 g; Isobutyraldehyde 10 g; Veratraldehyde 10 g;
      and 2,3-butanedione (Diacetyl) 10 g. The combination was labeled
      BA3. A cloud dispersion of the repellent composition was delivered
      to a population of Caribbean reef and blacknose shark
      competitively feeding. The sharks were dispersed from the feeding
      zone. In one Syringe Assay with the BA3 repellent on a juvenile
      lemon shark, tonic immobility was terminated. In two other Syringe
      Assays (one on a lemon shark and one on a nurse shark) behavioral
      changes were observed within tonic immobility. In one additional
      Syringe Assay, a nurse shark experienced a violent seizure and the
      assay could not be finished.<br>
      <br>
      [0214] A combination of aldehydes and ammonium acetate was
      prepared in the following amounts in 258 grams of denatured
      alcohol and 200 g of water: butyraldehyde 72.1 g; isobutyraldehyde
      36.2 g; veratraldehyde 35.0 g; and ammonium acetate 50 g. The
      repellent composition was labeled BA4. In two cloud assays in
      free-swimming competitively feeding Caribbean reef and blacknose
      sharks, a cloud dispersion of 500 mL of the repellent composition
      BA4 repelled the sharks from the feeding zone.<br>

      and mesityl oxide, tonic immobility was terminated. In a Syringe
      assay on a nurse shark using decanal tonic immobility was
      terminated. In a Syringe assay on a lemon shark using heptanal, no
      response was observed. This lack of response may have resulted
      from an unfavorable water current.<br>
      <br>
      Example 9<br>
      Carboxylic Acid Elasmobranch Repellents<br>
      <br>
      [0217] A wide range of carboxylic acids was tested on lemon,
      nurse, blacktip, blacknose, tiger and great hammerhead sharks. The
      carboxylic acids listed in Table 9 were each tested. Further, a
      range of doses of the following components were tested: cinnamic
      acid; citric acid; crotonic acid; lactic acid; aqueous succinic
      acid; crotonic acid, cinnamic acid, and maleic acid in glycol; and
      crotonic acid, citric acid and fumaric acid in solution. See Table
      24. All compositions evidenced repellent characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] The results together demonstrate the effective repellent
      characteristics of carboxylic acid compositions. Tonic immobility
      studies were carried out on many different carboxylic acids as
      well as cloud dispersal studies in free-swimming individual
      sharks. The data demonstrate the repellent activity of carboxylic
      acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0219] In a first set of studies on the effectiveness of
      carboxylic acids as elasmobranch repellents, each tested substance
      was subjected to the following protocol. In a first micropipette
      assay on a juvenile lemon shark, an oral dose of no more than 100
      microliters of carboxylic acid was observed to terminate tonic
      immobility. An oral dose of no more than 400 microliters was then
      delivered by micropipette into the mouth of a juvenile nurse
      shark. Tonic immobility was terminated. For butyric acid, each
      derivative of butyric acid and each naturally occurring acid
      listed in Table 9, the protocol was successfully repeated and each
      treatment resulted in termination of tonic immobility for each
      listed substance. The data evidences the gustatory repelling
      activity of carboxylic acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0220] Further studies on carboxylic acids and mixtures of
      carboxylic acids were pursued. The data is contained in Table 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0221] In four of four Hd Syringe assays, citric acid between 0.3
      mL and 2.4 mL of citric acid 50% w/w was delivered about three
      inches from the mouth of a lemon shark. Each assay terminated
      tonic immobility. Seven Syringe 3/5/10 assays on nurse and lemons
      sharks were employed with crotonic acid solution. In four of the
      seven assays the crotonic acid was delivered directly to the mouth
      on a longline or within 10 inches of the shark's mouth. Tonic
      immobility was terminated. In one of the seven assays, the
      crotonic acid was delivered directly to the mouth of the shark on
      a longline and a behavioral response was observed in tonic
      immobility. In two of the seven assays, 6 mL of crotonic acid was
      delivered to lemon sharks at a distance of 36 inches from the
      shark's mouth. No response was observed. The lack of response is
      explained by the small volume delivered at a very large distance.
      See Table 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] In two of three Syringe 3/5/10 assays, lactic acid was
      delivered to lemon sharks and terminated tonic immobility. In a
      single Syringe 3/5/10 assay, lactic acid was delivered to a lemon
      shark and no behavioral change was observed. See Table 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] Crotonic Acid (25.0 g), Cinnamic Acid (10.0 g) and Maleic
      Acid (25.0 g) were combined in 100.0 g Diethyl Glycol Monoethyl
      Ether to create a repellent composition. In three of four Syringe
      3/5/10 assays, the repellent carboxylic acid composition
      (crotonic/cinnamic/maleic) was delivered to tiger and blacknose
      sharks and terminated tonic immobility. In one of four Syringe
      3/5/10 assays, delivery of the repellent actually missed the mouth
      of the shark and only a behavior change was seen in tonic
      immobility. See Table 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0224] In a cloud dispersal assay 400 ml of the carboxylic acid
      composition (crotonic/cinnamic/maleic) was dispersed from a
      diptube near the mouth of a great hammerhead shark. The shark fled
      the area and did not return. See Table 24.<br>

      [0225] In a surrounding cloud dispersal assay, 500 mL of a mixture
      of 20% w/w Crotonic acid, 10% w/w Citric acid and 5% w/w Cinnamic
      acid solubilized in 50:50 w/w water:ethanol was delivered in a
      subsurface dose in the vicinity of a population of competitively
      feed sharks (5 Caribbean reef sharks and 2 blacknose sharks). The
      sharks were dispersed and did not return.<br>
      <br>
      [0226] Together, these data evidence the effectiveness of
      carboxylic acids and combinations of carboxylic acids as
      elasmobranch repellents.<br>

      [0227] Tonic immobility studies were carried out on juvenile lemon
      sharks and juvenile nurse sharks using 100% pyridine, 100%
      3-methylpyridine and 100% 2-amino-3-picoline at 95% or
      2-amino-3-picoline 95% cut to 10% w/w in desalinated water.
      Syringe 3/5/10, Hd Syringe and Micropipette assays were carried
      out as described in Examples 1 and 2. In three Syringe and six
      Bite assays on juvenile nurse sharks all assays terminated tonic
      immobility. In three Syringe and one Syringe 3/5/10 assay on
      juvenile lemon sharks all assays terminated tonic immobility. In
      one Syringe assay and one Syringe 3/5/10 assay on blacktip sharks
      both resulted in termination of tonic immobility. In one cloud
      dispersion assay with 2-amino-3-picoline 95% cut to 10% w/w with
      desalinated water, Caribbean reef sharks demonstrated a population
      decrease upon the administration of 500 mL of repellent. See Table

      <b>INTRODUCTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] This invention relates generally to electropositive metals
      for repelling elasmobranchs and methods of using electropositive
      metals to repel elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Elasmobranchs represent a significant problem in the
      commercial fishing industry. Elasmobranchs are often inadvertently
      caught on fishing tackle directed at other more commercially
      valuable kinds of fish. This inadvertent catching of elasmobranchs
      (or other non-valued fish) is called "by-catch." As many as 100
      million elasmobranchs are killed each year as by-catch. This loss
      of life has resulted in a real threat to several shark species.
      Currently, as many as 80 species of shark are considered
      threatened with extinction.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Further, when elasmobranchs are caught as by-catch, fishing
      operations receive no return on their investment since the shark
      is caught on a hook that might have otherwise brought in a
      marketable fish. Additionally, the fishing tackle on which a shark
      is caught often must be cut loose for the safety of those working
      on the fishing vessel causing a loss of both equipment and time.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Longlining is a commercial fishing method that suffers
      significant losses from shark by-catch. Longlining uses multiple
      baited individual fish hooks with leaders strung at intervals
      along an often very long (2-3 miles) main fishing line. Longline
      fishing operations routinely target swordfish and tuna. The
      longline hooks, however, are not selective and elasmobranchs are
      sometimes caught in greater numbers than the intended catch. The
      result is great loss of life in elasmobranchs and significant
      financial losses in the longline industry. Elasmobranchs cause
      additional losses in the longline fishing industry by scavenging
      marketable fish caught on longlines before the fish may be
      retrieved for processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Elasmobranchs also represent a problem in the commercial
      trawling industry. Trawling is a commercial fishing method that
      catches fish in nets. Elasmobranchs cause significant losses for
      trawlers because they scavenging fish caught in trawl nets before
      they are retrieved for processing. As such, valuable fish are
      often lost to shark predation. Also, sharks often tear holes in
      the nets, resulting in partial or complete loss of catch and
      significant repair costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] There has been a long-felt need for methods and devices to
      deter elasmobranchs from commercial fishing lines and nets.
      Attempts in the middle of the twentieth century were made to
      protect trawl nets with electric discharge devices (Nelson, "Shark
      Attack and Repellency Research: An Overview," Shark Repellents
      from the Sea ed. Bernhard Zahuranec (1983) at pg .20).
      Nevertheless, no commercially effective repellent has yet to be
      made available for reducing shark by-catch in the commercial
      fishing industry or for reducing loss of valuable fish or fishing
      tackle to shark predation. Further, Applicant is unaware of any
      consideration in the art of the use of electropositive metals to
      repel elasmobranchs to limit by-catch and other losses from
      elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] An effective shark repellent would not only be valuable to
      the fishing industry but also would be valuable for protecting
      humans from shark attacks. No effective repellent has yet to be
      marketed for limiting the risk of shark attacks faced by humans
      exposed to elasmobranchs. Over the last 50 years antishark
      measures employed to protect humans from shark have included
      electrical repellent devices (Gilbert &amp; Springer 1963, Gilbert
      &amp; Gilbert 1973), acoustical playbacks (Myrberg et al. 1978,
      Klimley &amp; Myrberg 1979), visual devices (Doak 1974) and
      chemical repellents (Tuve 1963, Clark 1974, Gruber &amp; Zlotkin
      1982). None of these procedures proved satisfactory in preventing
      shark attacks. (Sisneros (2001)). As such, the long felt need for
      an effective repellent had not been satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Researchers have historically used several bio-assays to
      determine if a repellent evokes a flight response in shark. One
      such bio-assay measures the effect of a repellent on a shark that
      is immobilized in "tonic immobility." Tonic immobility is a state
      of paralysis that typically occurs when a shark is subject to
      inversion of its body along the longitudinal axis. This state is
      called "tonic," and the shark can remain in this state for up to
      15 minutes thereby allowing researchers to observe effects of
      repellents. After behavioral controls are established, an object
      or substance that has a repelling effect will awaken a shark from
      a tonic state. Researchers can quantify the strength of a
      repellent effect from these studies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] The applicant has discovered that an electropositive metal
      is an effective elasmobranch repellent useful in limiting by-catch
      as well as protecting humans. Electropositive metals, particularly
      the Lanthanide metals, known or hereinafter developed, that are of
      sufficient electropositivity to repel elasmobranchs are acceptable
      in aspects of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] According to a non-limiting embodiment of the present
      invention, an apparatus for repelling elasmobranchs is provided
      comprising an electropositive metal. Preferably, the
      electropositive metal is a Lanthanide metal. More preferably, the
      electropositive metal is a Mischmetal. Electropositive metals may
      have a shape of a cylinder, a cone, a circle, a cube, a disk, a
      bar, a sphere, a plate, a rod, a ring, a tube, a stick or a block.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Electropositive metals of the present invention preferably
      have a revised Pauling electronegativity of less then 1.32. In a
      non-limiting embodiment, an electropositive metal has a cathode
      half-cell standard electrode potential greater then 1.9 volts in
      aqueous solution. In a non-limiting embodiment, the
      electropositive metal is a Lanthanide metal, a Mischmetal, an
      Alkaline Earth metal, an Alkali metal, or a Group 3 metal on the
      periodic table.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] According to a first non-limiting aspect of the present
      invention, an apparatus is provided comprising an electropositive
      metal and a buoy, a barge, a net, fishing tackle or any
      combination thereof. Fishing tackle may comprise a longline, a
      main line, a gangion, a branchline, a weight, a buoy, a net, or
      any combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] According to a second non-limiting aspect of the present
      invention, an apparatus is provided comprising an electropositive
      metal and a fish hook. Such fish hook may be individual or
      attached to longline or mainline and such fish hook may have a
      single or multiple hooks.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] According to a third non-limiting aspect of the present
      invention, an apparatus is provided comprising a surfboard and an
      electropositive metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In fourth non-limiting aspect of the present invention, a
      method is provided for repelling elasmobranchs comprising
      attaching an electropositive metal to a human body or to clothing
      or accessories associated with a human body. In an aspect of the
      invention, an electropositive metal may be attached to a human
      ankle or wrist. In a further aspect an electropositive metal may
      be attached to a bracelet. In yet a further aspect an
      electropositive metal may be attached to a belt, a weight belt for
      diving or flippers. In yet a further aspect, an electropositive
      metal may be housed within a surfboard or attached to a surfboard.
      In yet another aspect, an electropositive metal may be trailed
      along with a human in water.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] "By-catch" is any kind of fish that is caught in a fishing
      operation wherein the catching of the fish is not the object of
      the fishing operation. For example, if the target fish of a
      longline fishing operation is tuna, an elasmobranch caught on a
      hook of the longline is by-catch.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] "Elasmobranchs" in this specification means one or more
      elasmobranchii in the super-orders Galeomorphii, Squalomorphii,
      and Batoidea and orders Squaliformes (dogfish), Carcharhiniformes
      (requiem sharks), Lamniformes (mackerel sharks), Rajiformes (true
      rays), Pristiformes (sawfishes), Torpediniformes (electric rays)
      and certain Orectolobiformes (carpet sharks). Elasmobranchs in
      this specification includes nurse sharks, an Orectolobiform, but
      this specification does not include the other carpet sharks, such
      as wobbegongs.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] An "Electropositive metal" is a metal which readily donates
      electrons to form positive ions. Electropositive metals are strong
      reducing agents and all react with water to some degree, typically
      liberating hydrogen gas or forming a hydroxide. The most
      electropositive metals tends to be found on the left-hand side of
      the Periodic Table of the elements, particularly in Groups I, II,
      III, and the Lanthanides. In general, electropositivity decreases
      and electronegativity increases as one moves to the right hand
      side of the Periodic Table of the elements. The most
      electropositive metal known is Francium, which is radioactive. The
      most stable electropositive metal is Cesium which is highly
      reactive in water and air. Electropositive metals typically do not
      exhibit any permanent magnetism (ferromagnetism) at room
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] "Revised Pauling Electronegativity" is is a chemical
      property which describes the power of an atom to attract electrons
      towards itself. First proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932 as a
      development of valence bond theory it has been shown to correlate
      with a number of other chemical properties. Electronegativity
      cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other
      atomic or molecular properties The Pauling electronegativity for
      an element is calculated using the dissociation energies of at
      least two types of covalent bonds formed by that element. Linus
      Pauling's original values were updated in 1961 to take account of
      the greater availability of thermodynamic data, and it is these
      "Revised Pauling" values of the electronegativity which are most
      usually used.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] "Standard Electrode Potential" is the measure of the
      individual potential of any electrode at standard ambient
      conditions, which is at a temperature of 298K, solutes at a
      concentration of 1 M, and gases at a pressure of 1 bar. The basis
      for an electrochemical cell such as the galvanic cell is always a
      reduction-oxidiation reaction which can be broken down into two
      half-reactions: oxidation at anode (loss of electron) and
      reduction at cathode (gain of electron). Electricity is generated
      due to electric potential difference between two electrodes. This
      potential difference is created as a result of the difference
      between individual potentials of the two metal electrodes with
      respect to the electrolyte (In practice, seawater serves as the
      conductive electrolyte). In an electrochemical cell, an
      electropositive metal acts as the cathode, and the standard
      electrode potential represents the voltage of the reduction
      half-cell reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A "Lanthanide metal" belongs to the series comprising the
      15 elements with atomic numbers 57 through 71, from Lanthanum to
      Lutetium. All lanthanides are f-block elements, corresponding to
      the filling of the 4f electron shell, except for lutetium which is
      a d-block Lanthanide. The Lanthanide series is named after
      Lanthanum. The Lanthanide series is also commonly referred to as
      the "rare earths" or "rare earth elements".<br>
      <br>
      [0031] "Mischmetal" is an alloy of Lanthanide elements in various
      naturally-occurring proportions. The term "Mischmetal" is derived
      from the German "Mischmetal" meaning mixed metals. Mischmetals are
      also called Cerium mischmetal, rare earth mischmetal or misch
      metal. A typical composition includes approximately 50% Cerium and
      45% Lanthanum, with small amounts of Neodymium and Praseodymium.
      Other Mischmetal alloy mixtures include Lanthanum-rich Mischmetal,
      Ferrocerium, and Neodymium-Praseodymium Mischmetal.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] An "Alkaline Earth" metal belongs to the series of elements
      comprising Group 2 of the Periodic Table of elements: Beryllium,
      Magnesium, Calcium, Strontium, Barium, and Radium. The alkaline
      earth metals are silvery colored, soft, low-density metals, which
      react readily with halogens to form ionic salts, and with water to
      form strongly alkaline hydroxides.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] An "Alkali Earth" metal belongs to the series of elements
      comprising Group I of the Periodic Table of elements: Lithium,
      Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium, Cesium, and Francium. The alkali
      metals are all highly reactive and are rarely found in elemental
      form in nature. As a result, in the laboratory they are stored
      under mineral oil. They also tarnish easily and have low melting
      points and densities.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A "Group 3 metal" belongs to the third vertical column of
      the Periodic Table of elements. While Lanthanides are usually
      considered part of Group 3, the metallic elements Yttrium and
      Scandium all always considered Group 3 metals. The physical
      properties of Yttrium and Scandium resemble Lanthanides and these
      two metals are commonly considered part of the "rare earths".<br>
      <br>
      [0035] "Longline" refers to a fishing line that may extend up to
      many miles wherein a mainline extends the full length of the
      longline and individual shorter gangion lines attached to the
      mainline are spaced at set intervals (perhaps several feet or
      meters or perhaps 1000 feet or greater apart). Hooks are attached
      to the individual gangion lines. Hooks may be baited and used to
      catch target fish. The addition of an electropositive metal repels
      elasmobranchs from the baited hooks as well as from the region of
      the longline generally.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] "Target fish" is any kind of fish, the catching of which is
      the object of a fishing operation. For example, the target fish of
      a longline fishing operation may be tuna. A fish that is caught on
      the longline that is not tuna would not be a target fish.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] "Tonic immobility" is the state of paralysis that typically
      occurs when an elasmobranch is subject to inversion of its body
      along the longitudinal axis of the body, i.e., is belly up. An
      elasmobranch can remain in this state for up to 15 minutes. While
      in tonic immobility, the shark is comatase and unresponsive to
      many external stimuli. Biologists often perform surgery on sharks
      using tonic immobility, precluding anesthesia. An effective shark
      repellent terminates tonic immobility, often violently, thus,
      tonic immobility is useful as a bioassay for testing the
      effectiveness of electropositive metals. <br>
      <br>
      I. Electropositive Metals as Repellents of Elasmobranchs<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The applicant first observed the unusual repellent effects
      of electropositive Lanthanide metals on sharks when
      tonically-immobilized juvenile lemon sharks (N. brevirostris)
      exhibited violent rousing behavior in the presence of a 153 gram
      99.95% Samarium metal ingot. As the Samarium metal was moved
      towards the immobilized shark's head, the shark terminated tonic
      immobility, in the direction away from the approaching metal. For
      experimental controls, pure Chromium, an antiferromagnetic metal,
      and pyrolytic graphite, a highly diamagnetic substance, failed to
      produce any behavioral responses in juvenile lemon sharks.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A polystyrene white plastic blinder was used to remove any
      visual and motion cues from an approaching electropositive metal.
      This blinder was placed close to the shark's eye, sufficiently
      shielding its nares, eyes, gills, and head up to its pectoral fin.
      Again, Samarium metal terminated tonic immobility in all test
      subjects at a range of 2 to 50 cm from the blinder. Chromium metal
      and pyrolytic graphite did not produce any notable behavioral
      shifts. In order to confirm that pressure waves were not affecting
      the test subjects, the tester's hand was moved underwater towards
      the shark's head both with and without blinders at varying speeds.
      This motion also did not disrupt the immobilized state. The same
      series of experiments were repeated with juvenile nurse sharks (G.
      cirratum) and yielded the same behavioral results.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The same experimental protocol was repeated with a 73 gram
      ingot of 99.5% Gadolinium metal, an electropositive Lanthanide
      metal, and yielded the same behavioral results in both juvenile
      lemon sharks and nurse sharks. It is noted that the rousing
      behavior was most violent when Samarium metal was used.
      Additionally, the Gadolinium metal corroded quickly after seawater
      exposure, and therefore would be appropriate for a one-time use
      application.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In order to eliminate the possibility of galvanic cell
      effects, juvenile sharks were removed from their pens and brought
      at least 15 meters away from any submerged metal objects. All
      testers and witnesses removed watches, rings, and jewelry so that
      only the lanthanide metal was exposed to seawater. The same
      experimental method was repeated in lemon sharks and we report
      that tonic immobility was terminated with electropositive Samarium
      metal in all tests.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The application has discovered that waving Samarium or
      Gadolinium in air above immobilized or resting sharks does not
      effect behavior, even when the metal is very close to the water's
      surface. The electropositive metal must be in contact with
      seawater in order to produce the repellent effect. This is notably
      different from the effects of a rare-earth magnet, which will
      often terminate tonic immobility at close range in air.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The effects of an electropositive Lanthanide metal on
      free-swimming sharks were also evaluated. Two juvenile nurse
      sharks (less than 150 cm total length) were allowed to rest in an
      open-water captive pen. The tester approached the nurse sharks and
      moved his hand near the pen wall. His hand contained no metal.
      Both nurse sharks remained at rest. Next, the tester presented the
      153 gram ingot of electropositive Samarium metal underwater to the
      pen wall and we note that both nurse sharks awakened and rapidly
      swam away from the tester's locale. Next, a highly-stimulated
      competitively-feeding population of six blacknose sharks (C.
      acronotus) (total length up to 120 cm) and six Caribbean reef
      sharks (C. perezii) (total length up to 210 cm) was established
      using chum and fish meat. A diver entered the water near the
      population of sharks with the 153 gram of Samarium metal secured
      to one end of a 1.5 meter-long polyvinyl chloride pole. As
      free-swimming sharks swam close to the diver, the control end of
      the pole (without metal) was presented in a left-right waving
      motion. Approaching sharks would swim past, bump, or briefly bite
      the pole. The diver then turned the Samarium metal-end of the pole
      towards the approaching sharks. All blacknose sharks exhibited a
      "twitching" or "jerking" behavior as they came near the metal
      ingot and quickly swam away. Caribbean reef sharks generally
      avoided the metal, but did not exhibit the twitching behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Following the aforementioned initial experiments, many
      electropositive metals were procured and presented to
      tonic-immobilized juvenile sharks. The violence of the shark's
      response to each metal was scored on a scale of 0 to 4, with 0
      equating to no response and 4 equating to a violent rousing
      reaction. All testing was performed in the Bahamas using
      open-water captive pens. Arc-melted 100 gram Lanthanide metal
      ingots, Calcium, and Strontium were obtained from Metallium Inc.,
      USA. Lanthanum, Cerium, Neodymium, Yttrium, Praseodymium and
      Mischmetal samples were obtained from HEFA Rare Earth Metals,
      Canada. Magnesium, Beryllium, transition metals and nonmetals were
      procured as surplus items online from EBay.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In juvenile N. brevirostris and G. cirratum, the applicant
      has found that the following Lanthanide metals all terminated the
      tonic state at distances less than 0.1 meters: 100 grams of 99%
      purity Lanthanum metal, 90 grams of 99% purity Cerium metal, 100
      grams of 99% purity Praseodymium metal, 100 grams of 99% purity
      Neodymium metal, 73 grams of 99.95% purity Samarium met al, 145 g
      of arc-melted 99% purity Terbium metal, 89 g of arc-melted 99%
      purity Erbium metal, 100 grams of arc-melted 99% purity Holmium
      metal, 100 grams of arc-melted 99% Gadolinium metal, 100 grams of
      arc-melted 99% Dysprosium metal, and 100 grams of arc-melted 99%
      purity Ytterbium metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In the same experiment, 75 grams of 99% purity Yttrium
      metal, a Group 3 metal, also terminated tonic immobility in
      juvenile N. brevirostris.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In the same experiment, a 30 gram 99% purity ingot of
      Strontium and separately, a 40 gram 99% purity ingot of Calcium
      terminated tonic immobility in juvenile G. cirratum. These metals
      were highly <br>
      reactive in seawater and dissolved before a second series of tests
      could be performed.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In the same experiment, the following Mischmetals
      terminated tonic immobility in N. brevirostris: An 80 gram slice
      of Cerium Mischmetal, and a 100 gram slice of
      Neodymium-Praseodymium Mischmetal.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In the same experimental, the following Alkaline Earth
      metals terminated tonic immobility in N. brevirostris: A 70 gram
      block of 99% Magnesium, and a 10 gram pellet of 99% purity Barium.
      The Barium pellet reacted violently with seawater and a subsequent
      test could not be performed.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Transition metals and nonmetals, which are much less
      electropositive than the Lanthanides, Alkali, Alkaline Earth, and
      Group 3 metals, were also screened using the tonic immobility
      bioassay. The following transition metals and metalloids failed to
      illicit a rousing response in immobilized juvenile N.
      brevirostris: A 20 gram disc of 99.95% purity Tellurium, a 20 gram
      cylinder of 99.5% purity Tungsten, a 20 gram cylinder of 99.5%
      purity Cobalt, a 20 gram cylinder of 99.5% purity Iron, a 20 gram
      cylinder of 99.5% purity Niobium, a 20 gram cylinder of 99.5%
      purity Zirconium, a 20 gram square of 99.95% Rhenium, a 100 gram
      pillow of Aluminum, and a 15 gram square of pyrolytic graphite
      (Carbon).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Based on the aforementioned experimental results, a close
      correlation was found between the revised Pauling
      electronegativity values for the electropositive metals, and
      behavioral response. As the revised Pauling electronegativity
      decreased, the violence of the shark's response seemed to
      increase. A significant repellency threshold was found at a
      revised Pauling electronegativity of 1.32 or less-Metals with
      electronegativities greater than 1.32 did not produce the
      response. Highly reactive metals, such as Strontium and Calcium
      (electronegativities of 0.89 and 1.00 respectively) produced a
      violent rousing reaction as expected.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] An electropositive metal for repelling elasmobranchs may
      comprise the shape of a cylinder, a cone, a circle, a cube, a
      disk, a bar, a sphere, a plate, a rod, a ring, a tube, a stick, a
      block, a tapered cone, or any other shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The mode of action of electropositive metals on
      elasmobranchs is not fully understood. While not wishing to be
      bound by any particular theory, one plausible theoretical
      explanation for this surprising finding of repellent activity of
      electropositive metals is the possibility that relatively high
      voltages, ranging from 0.8 VDC to 2.7 VDC with currents up to 0.1
      milliamperes, are created between the metal and the shark's skin.
      This electromotive force may over-stimulate the ampullae of
      Lorenzini (known to be used by elasmobranchs for navigation and
      orientation), which saturate below 100 nanovolts, causing a highly
      unnatural stimulus to the shark.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Electropositive metals exhibit no measurable permanent
      magnetism (ferromagnetism). The applicant hypothesized that a
      magnetic or electrical field was being induced by the metal's
      movement through seawater. The applicant attempted to measure
      minute magnetic fields being produced by the movement of Samarium
      metal through seawater in a closed system. A submersible
      calibrated milliGauss meter probe was secured in a plastic tank
      containing seawater with the same salinity, pH, and temperature of
      the water used in previous shark testing. After zeroing out the
      Earth's magnetic field, the applicant did not detect any magnetic
      fields being produced by the movement of Samarium metal through
      the tank, within tenths of a milliGauss<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Electromotive forces generated by electropositive metals
      are effective repellents for elasmobranchs, excluding certain
      carpet sharks in the family Orectolobidae. It is believed that
      electropositive metals are not effective repellents against carpet
      sharks because carpet sharks, particularly spotted wobbegongs
      (Orectolobus maculatus), are ambush predators and rely more on
      visual, olfaction, and lateral line clues than this
      electromagnetic sense. This species of shark is found chiefly in
      Australia and Indonesia, and does not represent significant
      by-catch species or species that are known to be aggressive
      against humans. Electropositive metals, however, are effective
      against nurse sharks, another Orectolobiform.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Electropositive metals have been demonstrated to act as
      acceptable repellents of elasmobranchs. The repellent activity of
      electropositive has been shown to be better than existing
      shark-repellent technology with the exception of certain chemical
      repellents and magnetic repellents being developed by SHARK
      DEFENSE LLC that have a greater range of action.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] A. Electromotive Forces<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The repellency of an electropositive metal may be measured
      in a variety of ways. The applicant has found that the standard
      electrode potential of the cathode half-cell reaction of an
      electropositive metal in aqueous medium can be measured in a
      closed system using an electropositive metal at the anode (the
      site of oxidation), a piece of shark skin at the cathode (the site
      of reduction), and seawater as an electrolyte. Electromotive
      forces were measured using a calibrated direct current voltmeter.
      Electromotive forces greater than 0.8 volts were recorded for all
      electropositive metals, with Lithium metal, an Alkali earth metal,
      producing the highest measurable voltage at 2.71 volts. This
      demonstrated that cations and anions were exchanged through the
      electrolyte. These measured electromotive forces closely
      correlated to published standard electrode potentials for
      electropositive metals. A closed system using an electropositive
      metal at the external cathode (-) and a piece of shark skin at the
      external anode (+) with seawater electrolyte represents a simple
      and effective means of measuring electromotive forces and
      predicting repellency.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The strength of an electropositive metal's electromotive
      force field is inversely related to the distance an object is from
      the metal. As such, metals with a low standard electrode potential
      may repel elasmobranchs if the elasmobranch moves close enough to
      sense the electromotive force field of the metal. A highly
      electropositive metal having sufficient strength to repel an
      elasmobranch at sufficient distance such that the elasmobranch is
      deterred from striking a baited hook or coming near a person or
      other subject is preferred. It is more preferred that an
      electropositive metal have a standard electrode potential of at
      least 2.00 volts in seawater to provide sufficient electromotive
      force to repel an elasmobranch away from a baited hook or a person
      before the elasmobranch may bight the hook or harm the person.
      Because an elasmobranch may act to strike a hook or person at a
      distance from the target, the higher the standard electrode
      potential or the lower the revised Pauling electronegativity of
      the metal, the more effective it will be. II. Methods and Devices
      for Electropositive Metals<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A. Electropositive Metals<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Exemplary and non-limiting electropositive metals in
      accordance with the invention may be constructed of any metal that
      is capable of generating an electromotive force in seawater
      relative to the shark's skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Electromotive forces may be generated in any manner known
      to the skilled artisan who is practicing aspects of the invention
      or electrochemistry.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] There are many varieties of electropositive metals
      including the Lanthanide metals, the Alkaline Earth metals, the
      Alkali metals, Mischmetals, and the Group 3 metals on the periodic
      table of elements. Any electropositive metal having sufficient
      standard electrode potential or a low revised Pauling
      electronegativity may be used as a repellent of elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Exemplary electropositive metals include Lanthanum, Cerium,
      Neodymium, Praseodymium, Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium, Terbium,
      Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium,
      Yttrium, Scandium, Lithium, Magnesium, Calcium, Strontium, Barium,
      Cerium Mischmetal, Neodymium-Praseodymium Mischmetal, and
      Lanthanum-rich Mischmetal. Electropositive metals may be flexible
      or inflexible.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] A preferred electropositive metal contemplated within an
      aspect of the invention is Neodymium-Praseodymium Mischmetal.
      Neodymium-Praseodymium Mischmetal is a more preferred material
      than pure forms of Lanthanide or Alkaline earth metals due to cost
      and low corrosion reactivity in seawater. Pure Lanthanide metals,
      particularly the "late Lanthanides" comprising elements 63 through
      71, are prohibitively expensive in pure form. Pure Alkali metals
      are extremely reactive in seawater and present fire hazards in
      storage. Certain Alkaline earth metals are also highly reactive in
      seawater, such as Barium and are too short-lived for commercial
      fishing applications. Highly electropositive metallic elements
      such as Promethium, Radium, and Francium are highly radioactive
      and are not feasible for any elasmobranch repelling application.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In selecting an electropositive metal, a revised Pauling
      electronegativity of less than 1.32 is preferred. A revised
      Pauling electronegativity of about 1.14 or less is more preferred
      since the impact of the electromotive force field will be felt at
      a slightly greater distance from the metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Early Lanthanide metals, particularly elements 57 through
      62, commonly called the "early Lanthanides", possess revised
      Pauling Electronegativities less than 1.2, which is preferred.
      Similarly, Mischmetals containing combinations of Lanthanum,
      Cerium, Neodymium, and Praseodymium exhibit calculated revised
      Pauling electronegativities of less than 1.2, which is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In order to maximize electromotive forces, the surface area
      of an electropositive metal may be maximized. For example, a 6''
      diameter by 2'' thick cylindrical Cerium Mischmetal block (revised
      Pauling electronegativity of 1. 15) may be effective in repelling
      elasmobranchs at a range of 8 inches.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] A plurality of electropositive metals may be employed to
      repel elasmobranchs. For example, 1'' cube metals may be arranged
      in a 12'' long bar and used to repel elasmobranchs. The cube
      metals may be of any electropositive metal material capable of
      producing sufficient electromotive force at any distance of
      interest from the metal to repel elasmobranchs. Alternatively, a
      plurality of 1'' cube electropositive metals may be arranged
      linearly with a distance between each piece of metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] B. Electropositive Metals in Combination with Hooks<br>
      <br>
      [0071] A non-limiting aspect of the present invention is the use
      of electropositive metals to repel elasmobranchs from baited
      hooks. Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of an
      electropositive metal and a hook are illustrated in FIGS. 14. For
      example, in FIG. 1, an exemplary and non-limiting circle hook
      (140) is illustrated attached to a line (150) along with exemplary
      and non-limiting zone (I) in the circle hook and line where an
      electropositive metals may be placed or affixed. The preferred
      region (zone I) for metal placement is any region wherein the
      affixed or placed magnet does not obstruct the hook gap distance
      (zone II). Not more than 20% of the hook gap distance (zone II) is
      preferably obstructed by the metal such that the hook is not
      prevented from setting in the corner of the mouth of a target
      fish. Nevertheless, any arrangement wherein the hook is not
      prevented from catching target fish is acceptable. Tapered conical
      designs (not illustrated) are contemplated such that the diameter
      of the electropositive metal at the hook end is smaller than the
      diameter of the electropositive metal at the line end of zone I.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of an
      electropositive metal on a hook and line are illustrated in FIG.
      2. An electropositive metal (210) may be placed in proximity to a
      circle or offset circle hook (240) such that it rests on the hook
      eye (241) providing an exemplary embodiment such as the hook-metal
      combination embodied at 260. An electropositive metal (210) may be
      placed in proximity to a circle or off-set circle hook (240) such
      that it rests on the shank (242) of the hook providing an
      exemplary embodiment such as the hook-metal combination embodied
      at 270. A metal (210) may be placed on a circle or offset circle
      hook (240) such that it is secured to the outside of the shank
      (242) and the hook eye (241) providing an exemplary embodiment
      such as the hook-metal combination embodied at 280. Vinyl electric
      tape (not illustrated) may be used to secure the metal. Black
      vinyl tape is preferred to reduce reflections of light.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Electropositive metals may be provided in any shape. It is
      preferred that a metal's shape not significantly obstruct the hook
      gap distance (zone II). The metal may comprise a hole through
      which a lead, or gangion, or mainline (250) or other filamentous
      object may pass. Exemplary non-limiting shapes may include a cube
      or block of any size or other object having at least one plane
      comprising four right angles and a hole passing through the object
      such that fishing line or other filament may be passed through to
      affix the magnet in place on fishing tackle or other object.
      Alternative, non-limiting shapes may also include cylindrical or
      other circular, oval or oblong three-dimensional shapes having a
      hole passing through some portion of the shape (210). Alternative,
      non-limiting shapes may also include a hollow pyramid or a hollow
      trapezoid.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Alternative, non-limiting shapes may also include a solid
      cube or similar shape, a solid rectangle or similar shape, a solid
      bar or similar shape, a solid pyramid or similar shape, a solid
      trapezoid or similar shape or any other shape. Metals may be
      shaped as a ring, a trapezoid, a series of trapezoids, a series of
      trapezoids arranged in a larger ring pattern, a cone, a tapered
      cone, a narrow or wide cylinder or in the shape of a Billy club.
      Preferably, the shape when combined with a hook provides a hook in
      proximity to an electropositive metal comprising sufficient
      electromotive force field strength to repel elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of electropositive
      metal and hook are also illustrated in FIG. 3. An electropositive
      metal (310) may be placed in proximity to a j-hook (340) such that
      it rests on the hook eye (341) providing an exemplary embodiment
      such as the hook-metal combination embodied at 360. An
      electropositive metal (310) may be placed in proximity to a j-hook
      (340) such that it rests on the shank (342) of the hook providing
      an exemplary embodiment such as the hook-metal combination
      embodied at 370. An electropositive metal (310) may be placed on a
      j-hook (340) such that it is secured to the outside of the shank
      (342) and the hook eye (341) providing an exemplary embodiment
      such as the hook-metal combination embodied at 380. As described
      above in the illustration of FIG. 2, electropositive metal may be
      provided in any shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Exemplary and non-limiting combinations of an
      electropositive metal and hook are also illustrated in FIG. 4. An
      electropositive metal (410) may be placed in proximity to a treble
      hook (440) such that it rests on the hook eye (441) providing an
      exemplary embodiment such as the hook-metal combination embodied
      at 460. An electropositive metal (410) may be placed in proximity
      to a treble hook (440) such that it contacts the shank (442) of
      the hook providing an exemplary embodiment such as the hook-metal
      combination embodied at 470.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] A hook in accordance with the invention may be any hook
      that is capable of catching target fish. The hook may comprise
      stainless steel, steel, galvanized metals, ferromagnetic metals or
      any other material, metallic or plastic or any other composite.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] C. Electropositive Metals on Longlines<br>
      <br>
      [0079] An exemplary and non-limiting method of repelling
      elasmobranchs involving repelling elasmobranchs from longlines in
      accordance with the invention is illustrated in FIG. 5. A longline
      (500) may be deployed from a boat (561) to fish for a target fish
      of interest. The main line (550) of the longline may be attached
      to a buoy (520) and at a set distance from the buoy may be
      attached to an anchor (562). A set of gangions (530) with hooks
      (540) may be attached to the mainline beginning at the anchor
      (562) and may be spaced sufficiently to limit interaction between
      individual gangion lines (530). Each hook may have an
      electropositive metal mounted resting on the hook eye (541).
      Alternatively, the electropositive metal may be mounted on a hook
      shank (542) or may be secured to the outside of the hook (540).
      The hooks may be baited. The longline may be a demersal longline
      such that the main line is proximal to the ocean or otherwise
      water's floor. The longline may be a pelagic long line, such that
      the main line is nearer to the surface of the water, suspending in
      the water column, typically at 100-500 feet below the surface. In
      the aspect of the invention where the longline is a pelagic
      longline, anchors (562) may have less weight or may be absent from
      the longline apparatus. The longline may also be a semipelagic
      longline wherein the mainline is further down the water column
      from the surface as compared to a pelagic line but is not proximal
      to the water's floor or is not proximal to the water's floor on at
      least one end of the longline. Use of electropositive metals with
      longlines reduces by-catch of elasmobranchs.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Longlines comprising electropositive metals may be handled
      in the commercial environment in a manner similar to those
      practices known in the art of longline commercial fishing. Because
      hooks must be carefully managed to control tangling and hooking of
      objects on a longlining boat, including other portions of the
      tackle of the longline, commercial fishing operations and those of
      skill in the art will recognize how to handle longlines with
      hooks. Electropositive metals on longlines likewise may be handled
      in the same manners as one would consider appropriate in the art
      to avoid entanglements.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] As described above, electropositive metals of any size may
      be used in combination with a longline hook so long as the target
      fish may be caught on the hook. An exemplary electropositive metal
      on a longline hook may be 2''*0.25''*2''. Smaller electropositive
      metals are also acceptable. Electropositive metals of less than
      0.5'' cubed may be appropriate for smaller hook settings.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] D. Electropositive Metal Repellents on Buoys, Nets and
      Barges<br>
      <br>
      [0083] An exemplary and non-limiting method of repelling
      elasmobranchs with an electropositive metal or a plurality of
      electropositive metals placed on a buoy or barge or net is
      illustrated in FIG. 6. Buoys with electropositive metals as their
      weighted bases are shown as element 660 and 661 in FIG. 6A. The
      floating portion of the buoy (620) allows the buoy to float while
      the electropositive metal portion of the buoy (610) remains in the
      water because of its weight. A series of buoys comprising
      electropositive metals may be placed in a region to repel
      elasmobranchs or may be placed around a swimming area or rescue
      area to repel elasmobranchs. A series of buoys with
      electropositive metals may be accompanied by a series of
      electropositive metals submerged (611) in an area of interest,
      such as a swimming area. As illustrated in FIG. 6B, very large
      electropositive metals may be placed on a large floating barge
      (670) comprising an electropositive metal (610).<br>
      <br>
      [0084] An exemplary and non-limiting method of repelling
      elasmobranchs with a plurality of electropositive metals is
      illustrated in FIG. 6A as element 600, an elasmobranch repelling
      net apparatus. Buoys (660 and 661) may be employed to float a net
      (650) comprising a series of electropositive metals (640) held
      within the net and electropositive metal rings (630) holding the
      ropes of the net together. The net may be strung to the bottom of
      the water column using weighted electropositive metals (611). The
      net may be anchored to a specific location to provide a physical
      barrier. The net may provide a curtain of electromotive field
      forces to repel elasmobranchs from an area or to keep
      elasmobranchs from entering an area of interest, such as a
      swimming or working area. A net (650) comprising electropositive
      metals such as those illustrated as elements 610, 611, 630 and 640
      may also be used to trawl for fish, shrimp or other aquatic
      species. In another non-limiting aspect of the invention,
      electropositive metals may be placed in aquaculture cages to repel
      sharks from predation or scavenging of cultured stock.
      Electropositive metals are useful to prevent damage by
      elasmobranchs to aquaculture cages, nets or other equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] E. Surfboard Fitted with Electropositive Metal<br>
      <br>
      [0086] A non-limiting repelling device in accordance with the
      invention may comprise a surfboard comprising an electropositive
      metal device. FIG. 7B illustrates exemplary surfboards in
      accordance with an aspect of the invention. A surfboard (720) may
      comprise an electropositive metal device such as Mischmetal (710)
      imbedded, affixed, attached or otherwise associated in any manner
      contemplated by one of skill in the art with the surfboard An
      electropositive metal may be pressed into a space drilled into the
      surfboard (730). It may also be affixed with glue, waterproof
      tape, Velcro or any other mechanism known in the art now and
      hereafter.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In an alternative non-limiting example in Figure A, a
      surfboard (750) may comprise an electropositive metal or plurality
      of electropositive metals in association with one another wherein
      the electropositive metal or metals are capable of spinning when
      placed in water (740). Such a spinning electropositive metal (740)
      may comprise individual metal pieces attached to a hub (770) that
      is attached to an axle (760) to allow free spinning of the
      electropositive metal or metals attached to the surfboard (720)
      when water current is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] An electropositive metal may be enclosed in the body of a
      surfboard or other watercraft or may be trailed behind a
      surfboard, other watercraft or swimmer.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] F. Electropositive Metal Repellents on Swimming and Diving
      Clothing and Accessories<br>
      <br>
      [0090] One exemplary non-limiting aspect of the present invention
      comprises an electropositive metal material for producing an
      electromotive force field near a swimmer or diver or other person
      or object in an elasmobranch environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Electropositive metals, such as for example, Mischmetal, or
      other electropositive metals may be worn as a bracelet or a band
      or otherwise placed in proximity of a person or object. An
      increase in the number of electropositive metals and an increase
      in the standard electrode potential of the metals that may be worn
      increases the electromotive force field around the wearer and
      increases the repelling activity of the bracelet, band or other
      metal article.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In a non-limiting example, an omnidirectional electromotive
      force field may be affixed or arranged near a subject or object
      exposed to an elasmobranch environment. The electromotive force
      field may be generated from, for example, an electropositive
      metal. An electropositive metal may be affixed, for example, to
      any portion of a swimmer's or diver's body such as the head, the
      leg, the arm, the torso, the ankle, the wrist, or any other
      portions of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] FIG. 8 illustrates a non-limiting example of
      electropositive metals (810) attached to a belt (801) (FIG. 8A) or
      bracelet (802) (FIG. 8B) or flippers (803) (FIG. 8C).<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Electropositive metals may likewise be attached to clothing
      or water accessories such as swim trunks, wet suits, headbands,
      flippers, goggles or other piece of clothing or accessory.
      Electropositive metals may be sewn into such clothing or may be
      affixed with tape, glue, Velcro or any other mechanism for
      affixing to clothing or accessories for swimming, diving or
      otherwise working or playing in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Many human-shark interactions in shallow water, especially
      around the State of Florida in the United States, are hypothesized
      to be "mistaken identity" by the shark in water with poor
      visibility. The blacktip shark (C. limbatus) and nurse shark (G.
      cirratum) are often implicated in these encounters. The sharks do
      not have an olfactory clue in most of these "mistaken identity"
      cases. A series of electropositive metals, such as Mischmetal or
      other electropositive metal, may be used as means to repel the
      shark as it approaches within a few inches of the metal. With an
      electropositive metal, such as Cerium, or an increased number of
      electropositive metals, to increase electromotive force field
      strength, repellent activity increases and the chance that a shark
      will be repelled prior to an investigatory bump or bite is greatly
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The invention is further described with the following
      non-limiting examples, which are provided to further illuminate
      aspects of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>III. EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Tonic Immobility Responses to Electropositive Metals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0097] In order to screen the repellency potential of various
      metals, 193 individual trials were conducted on juvenile sharks at
      South Bimini, Bahamas in open ocean pens. All sharks were placed
      into tonic immobility, and the behavioral response of the shark
      towards a test metal was scored using a scale of 0 to 4. A score
      of zero represented no response, with the shark remaining
      immobilized. A score of one represented a slight fin flinch or eye
      blink. A score of two represented a slight bend (less than 15
      degrees) away from the metal, without rousing. A score of three
      represented a strong bend away from the metal (more than 15
      degrees), without rousing. A score of four represents the
      termination of tonic immobility, with a rousing response,
      indicating adequate repellency. No more than three consecutive
      trials were performed on any one given shark. A minimum of 4 hours
      of rest was allotted before a shark was retested. Classifying the
      behavioral scores with a specific group on the Periodic Table of
      the element demonstrates that the electropositive metals found in
      Group 2 and Group 3 of the periodic table of elements produced a
      stronger repellent response than transition metals (Groups3
      through 12), a poor metal (Group 13), a metalloid (Group 16), and
      a nonmetal (Group 14). See Table 1.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0098] The aforementioned tests can also be analyzed in terms of
      the type of metal tested on the immobilized sharks. As expected,
      Alkali metals, Alkaline earths, Mischmetals, early Lanthanides,
      and late Lanthanides produced the highest repellency behavioral
      scores. These types of metals are electropositive and have revised
      Pauling electronegativities less then 1.32. See Table 2.<br>

      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Published Standard Electrode Potentials of Electropositive
        Metals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0099] The published standard electrode potentials (SEP) for the
      cathode half-cell reaction of electropositive metals is a
      practical means of determining the repellency of the metal without
      performing a bioassay. As the cathode half-cell reaction voltage
      increases, the repellent effect is also expected to increase. The
      published voltage represents the electromotive force between the
      electropositive metal and the reference electrode. Published
      standard electrode potentials typically use a standard hydrogen
      electrode as the reference electrode. In practice, shark skin is
      the reference electrode and produces measurable voltages at about
      88% of the published standard electrode potentials. The safe
      handling of highly electropositive metals must be considered, as
      well as the longevity of the metal in seawater. See Table 3.<br>

      [0100] Beryllium and Magnesium metals are Alkaline earths in Group
      2 of the periodic table of elements. These metals exhibit larger
      revised Pauling electro-negativities (1.56 and 1.31 respectively)
      than the Lanthanide metals. Magnesium, however, has a higher
      standard electrode potential (see Table 3) than beryllium and
      therefore is expected to be a better shark repellent than
      beryllium. Tonic immobility testing has confirmed that magnesium
      indeed produces aversive behavior in immobilized juvenile sharks.
      It is anticipated the beryllium would be weakly repellent based on
      the published standard electrode potentials. Additionally, the
      highly toxic nature of beryllium compounds preclude its use as a
      safe shark repellent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Target Fish not Repelled by Electropositive Metals</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0101] Preliminary research conducted on the effects of
      electropositive metals on adult cobia, Rachycentron canadum,
      suggests that electromotive forces produced by electropositive
      metals had little effect on captive cobia. Digital video of cobia
      striking at electropositive metals was recorded. Cobia were
      observed directly biting electropositive metals as well as
      transition metals. It is hypothesized that the shiny nature of the
      metals acted as a visual attractant to the fish. Since bony fish
      lack the ampullae of Lorenzini organ found in sharks, the fish
      were unable to detect the electromotive forces produced by the
      electropositive metals.<br>
