          Introduction:</b> The "Joe Cell" was discovered &amp;
        developed by an otherwise anonymous Australian named "Joe". It
        appears to be a quasi-electrolytic cell that somehow utilizes
        Zero-Point Energy or Orgone to generate a gas that is not hyfuel
        (the water is not consumed) that can run (or supplement the
        running of) automobiles and other engines, besides charging
        water for health applications, agriculture, etc. In April 2006,
        American experimenter Bill Williams was death-threatened by two
        unidentified gonzo punk jerkoffs who knew all about him and his
        family, etc... This event has of course sparked a resurgence of
        interest in the Joe Cell. Here is virtually all of the available
        data on the subject. Download it while you can. Proceed at your
        own risk....<br>

      </center>
      <p>To again cover the issues related to getting a Joe cell to
        stage 3, by a ‘normal' patient individual and utilising readily
        available tools and materials. </p>
      <p>Please note, most of the following material has been covered in
        my manual, there is very little additional data in this paper. </p>
      <p>However, this material is presented in a different way so that
        some people may find it easier to comprehend. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>On looking at the Web on subjects related to the Joe cell, two
        things crop up over and over. Namely, the incorrect use of
        information as supplied in my manual and the resultant cries of
        ‘I cannot get stage three, help!’. The cloud screens of
        misinformation, wild unsubstantiated guesses and sheer pie in
        the sky guess work does not help the above matter. </p>
      <p>Please let me try to tell you as to how I see the cell
        information problem. </p>
      <p>For obvious reasons, the expert on the Joe cell is Joe!
        However, as Joe has not published any material or authorised any
        photographs or videos, the information from the horses mouth is
        zero. </p>
      <p>So what do we do? Well, for a start, we must be very careful
        that we do not listen to information from the other end of the
        horse. With Joe we have a couple of options: </p>
      <p>1. Visit Joe and look, learn and listen. Great! many people
        have done that. Some actually have stayed with Joe for periods
        as long as 9 months! On leaving Joe, they were not able to
        replicate what Joe can do. </p>
      <p>2. Ring Joe up on the phone and have a talk. Great as well.
        Unfortunately people have talked to Joe for hours on end, and
        although they heard plenty, were still not able to replicate
        Joe’s work. </p>
      <p>Okay, what gives? How come all these thousands of visitors (
        yes, that figure is correct as Joe keeps a visitors book ), that
        are keen and eager cannot duplicate what Joe has shown them or
        told them on the phone? </p>
      <p>Six options: </p>
      <p>1. Joe is a fake, the cell is a dud. </p>
      <p>2. Joe is deliberately laying down a smoke screen. </p>
      <p>3. All the visitors are stupid and cannot follow simple
        instructions. </p>
      <p>4. Joe is a very special person and no one else has his special
        vibes. </p>
      <p>5. The cell will only work at Joe’s place due to a ley line, a
        space warp or similar. </p>
      <p>6. There is a set of special design procedures that Joe is not
        telling anybody about. </p>
      <p>From the above list, and after spending 8 years full time on
        the subject, I can tell you that you can eliminate completely,
        option 1, 3 and 5. </p>
      <p>Option 2 and 6 are a FACT! Option 4 is only partially true. </p>
      <p>Where does the above analysis leave us? </p>
      <p>The good news is, that if you know the special procedures
        required to make and start the cell and if you have the right ‘
        polarity ’ when in close proximity to the cell, there is no
        reason why you cannot get a cell to stage 3. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately life is not that easy, I still believe the Y
        factor is a variable to consider. As I am not privy to the Joe
        and Dennis secrets, I will assume that the polarity of the
        person is important at least in the early seeding stages of the
        cell. </p>
      <p>Joe has stated that the location and the polarity of the person
        does play a role, Dennis is saying that he has the problem
        licked. I am saying that I do not know, thus I am playing it
        safe by warning you that if all else fails check your location
        and your polarity. Both those topics are covered in my manual if
        you require further information. </p>
      <p>Of course when and if Joe and Dennis finally take pity on us,
        and lay their cards on the table, the whole Y factor issue
        should be resolved. </p>
      <p>I am not holding my breath however, as anal retentives have
        reasons to be retentive. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>PIN-POINTING THE PROBLEM</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>As this paper is headed ‘ Cell Problems ’, I will not cover
        problems in the transfer stages or the modifications required to
        the ‘ consuming ’ device. I will concentrate on the cell only. </p>
      <p>The above title is somewhat of a misnomer as I will describe
        how to make a stage 3 cell. If you do not follow the
        instructions, then you can pin point the problem to the step
        that you did not follow. </p>
      <p>I am telling you what I know will work. If you decide to take
        short cuts with my suggestions, fine, but don’t come to me when
        your cell doesn’t work! </p>
      <p>In the following sub-headings I have covered the locations
        where the problem may reside and I have suggested various
        options. </p>
      <p>Location --- Strictly not cell related, so see my manual. </p>
      <p>The individual --- As above. </p>
      <p>Cylinders and case material --- As we are employing
        electrolysis, it would be logical to employ a material that is
        largely immune to the actions of the electrolysis process. After
        many tests, and including Joe’s recommendations, stainless steel
        is the logical choice. All other material like copper, brass and
        aluminium are interactive. </p>
      <p>Joe has suggested food grade non-magnetic steel as the ‘ right
        ’ one. This advice is a little nebulous, but it points us to the
        300 series of stainless steels and logically the choice is out
        of 304, 316 and 316L. </p>
      <p>The dairy industry in Australia ( this is where Joe obtained
        his steel ) uses 304. Lately Joe has suggested 316 non-magnetic,
        food grade. </p>
      <p>I personally have found very good results with 316L. </p>
      <p>I would suggest to you that 304 or 316 are both fine, the
        points that are important is the non-magnetic aspects of the
        material and the neutrality to electrolysis. </p>
      <p>The next stage is to find the stainless and make sure that we
        buy the correct type. </p>
      <p>Where I am, I can simply go for a 20 mile drive and this will
        allow me to have a scrounge at several scrap metal dealers. Of
        course you may not be so lucky, you may have to buy it new,
        ouch. </p>
      <p>A couple of years ago, I was involved in the testing of all
        possible stainless steels for a potential mass producer of the
        cell for the world market. Now this was a chance of a life time
        for me as I did not have to pay the many thousands of dollars
        that were required to purchase a length of each type ( including
        316S designed for the nuclear industry, very beautiful material
        indeed ). </p>
      <p>After 7 months of testing, I made some very valuable
        conclusions that I want to share with you. </p>
      <p>* Most stainless has a seam along the entire length that is
        either a straight or spiral weld. The quality of this weld
        varies greatly as well as the uniformity of the thickness of the
        tube on the weld. </p>
      <p>* It is very hard to find seamless stainless. This converts to
        very expensive, and you really do not need it. </p>
      <p>* If the stainless is wrapped in a plastic sleeve or if it has
        the type number stamped on it at regular intervals, you will
        find that this type has a better seam weld. </p>
      <p>* If you can see a darker weld colour along the seam, I would
        suggest that you test it thoroughly before you pay for it. </p>
      <p>* If you can feel that the thickness of the tube is greater on
        the weld compared to the rest of the tube, again be very wary. </p>
      <p>* If as you rotate the tube in your hand, you can feel that it
        is not truly circular, again be wary. You could use a pair of
        callipers or similar if you do not trust your feel. The tube
        should be circular to very close limits. </p>
      <p>* I was unable to find a good tube in all the cheaper Asian
        imported material even though they had a mirror finish. You have
        been warned! </p>
      <p>To put the above together, I would suggest that you only buy
        top grade stainless AFTER you have tested it with your magnet. </p>
      <p>What magnet you say? </p>
      <p>All Joe cell experimenters have a rare earth magnet on a piece
        of string or Nylon, sheesh. </p>
      <p>The first thing that you learn about this magnet is that it
        loves to erase credit cards, so do the obvious, keep it well
        away from your wallet and similar. </p>
      <p>I have made a keeper for mine, that joins the North and South
        poles together and this reduces the stray fields considerably
        whilst I carry it. </p>
      <p>If you dangle the magnet on about a foot of line, you will
        notice that it will be gently attracted to some areas of the
        tube, but rather more to the seam. If it sticks to the seam and
        stays there supporting its own weight, that tube is NOT
        suitable! I don’t care if you are going to heat treat it or even
        if you get the Pope to bless it, give it a miss. </p>
      <p>Mild attraction, is okay as long as there is no areas that have
        patches of strong attraction. Remember, I am talking about
        checking the whole damn length and not just doing a ten second
        swing to impress the guy in the shop. Yes, it is a pain in the
        butt and may take you at least half an hour ( for a whole cell
        set ) and by this time any staff member would have long left,
        leaving you with a questioning look. &lt;g&gt; </p>
      <p>So to conclude this section, get the good grade and test it to
        make sure it is the good grade. </p>
      <p><b><i>Making the Cell ---</i></b> </p>
      <p>This involves cutting, polishing and joining operations. Any of
        these steps may cause irreversible damage to your investment, so
        think about it. </p>
      <p>Cutting can be performed with a bi-metal blade in a hacksaw,
        with an angle grinder and a metal cutting wheel or with a lathe.
        The secret is to keep the heat way, way down. If the cutting
        process will generate heat ( as with the angle grinder ), leave
        a ¼ inch spare in length and trim to size on a lathe. </p>
      <p>Nice and slow with a bi-metal blade in a hack saw will do the
        job. </p>
      <p>I would suggest that in all cases, the cylinders are finished
        to size on a lathe as this is the only easy method of assuring
        that all the cylinders will have two parallel and flat faces,
        and all tubes will be the same length. </p>
      <p>The overall match in length is not that critical, a few thou
        here to there does not matter! On assembly you simply make sure
        that the tops are all level and the bottom length difference is
        not that critical. </p>
      <p>The next step is the polishing. Before moving to that step
        again check your tubes for any extra magnetism, ALL OVER! It
        this has not changed, move on to the polishing. </p>
      <p>The rules of polishing are simple, the smoother the better, the
        less heat the better. </p>
      <p>The less the polish on the surface the less the efficiency of
        the cell, but it will still work. </p>
      <p>A mirror finish inside and out is great, but I for one have
        better things to do in life, however if you have the tools and
        the inclination and the time go for it. </p>
      <p>I spin my cylinders in a lathe and use a 360 grit emery cloth
        until all major scratch marks are removed and if you held a
        screw driver ( or similar ) right next to it you can see the
        reflection. At no stage are my tubes that smooth that I can use
        them as a mirror for shaving. Don’t laugh, I have seen tubes
        like that from others. Beautiful, but they did not work! </p>
      <p>Make sure that you polish in a circular sweep ( around the tube
        ) and not up and down the length. </p>
      <p>You do not want any criss-cross marks at all. </p>
      <p>When you are happy with these two operations, move on. If you
        have used any high speed polishing method that generated heat
        then, yep, check them all over for a change in their magnetic
        effects. </p>
      <p>The joints on the outer casings are super important and the
        source of MOST failures of the cell to go to stage three. As you
        can surmise, the cylinder to cone and the cone to outlet adaptor
        are the two joints that will stop the cell dead. </p>
      <p>A weld at either of these spots will create a lovely ring of
        heavily magnetised metal and stop the cell dead from being able
        to transfer the ‘ force ’ to where you want it. </p>
      <p>Have a real serious think here before you hit these areas with
        your arc welder designed for welding battle ships. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately I cannot enclose pictures with this paper, but my
        manual has a few of the related photos but not enough to do
        justice to the subject. </p>
      <p>I will have to work out some way of getting about 6o M/bytes of
        photos onto a suitable site. Anyway back to the subject at hand.
      </p>
      <p>Joe and I recommend no welding at these critical areas. This
        makes it makes it much harder as far as construction is
        concerned, but it is the only 100% guaranteed method of not
        introducing a magnetic change at these critical areas. </p>
      <p>The bottom joint to the flat base or cone or sphere is nowhere
        near as sensitive. </p>
      <p>I have made over 30 cells and all are different. I have
        featured a cell in the manual, ( Old Trusty ) that breaks most
        of the above rules, there are always exceptions to rules as
        after all rules are made to be broken, WHEN you know what you
        are doing that is. </p>
      <p>There are many ways of holding two pieces of metal at a butt
        joint without welding or brazing or even soldering. </p>
      <p>What you want is a seamless transition of tube inner diameter
        to cone and then to your outlet. Many ways of doing this, and we
        have the great advantage that the joint is not under any great
        pressure and thus welding is not mandatory. </p>
      <p>I will again stress that the less heat used on the joint, the
        greater is your guarantee of success. </p>
      <p>In descending order of preference of a joining method,( the
        lower the better ); </p>
      <p>oxy. acetylene welding, oxy acetylene brazing, arc welding, Mig
        welding, soldering, cold welding ( chemical two packs ), Tig
        welding, threaded joint, press fit joint, butt joint with outer
        support sleeve, butt joint and Sikaflex, one piece cell casing.
      </p>
      <p>From the above as you can see, the top joint is permanent and
        access should be provided via the bottom joint for maintenance
        operations. </p>
      <p><b><i>The central bolt fixture:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The bolt, washers and nut must also be compatible material and
        also must not exhibit magnetic anomalies. </p>
      <p>Whatever method you decide on to join the bolt to the inside of
        the one inch tube, please observe the following; </p>
      <p>* The bottom of the bolt head must be at least 1/8 of an inch
        inside the tube. </p>
      <p>* Do not weld the bolt to the tube, a press fit is the way to
        go. </p>
      <p>* Make sure that there are gaps for water circulation in and
        out the bottom of the tube. </p>
      <p>* Design your bolt fixture so that the neutrals are at least ½
        inch off the bottom of the cell ( that is if you are using a
        flat bottom plate ) </p>
      <p>* Insulate the bolt body from under the bolt head to your inner
        exit washer. Nylon or similar type tubing is fine. </p>
      <p><b><i>The insulators:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Many insulators have been tried, many insulators have failed! </p>
      <p>If the insulator leaves a pitted or burned mark where it is
        wedged against the cylinders, it is shorting out, It is no good,
        throw it out! I am not talking about shorting out as in Ohms law
        and low resistance. I am talking about a shunt to a very high
        frequency field! </p>
      <p><b>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:</b> </p>
      <p>One of the greatest causes of cell failures is the insulators.
        The insulators have to be compatible with your cell design, the
        water and the chemicals that are in the water. I do not mean
        deliberate chemicals that you put in. I mean the chemicals that
        are already in there. </p>
      <p>For example, the cell does generate ozone. Ozone mixed with air
        will make nitric acid ( reaction with the nitrogen ). Nitric
        acid is very chewy stuff. </p>
      <p>I am sick to death of people saying that Joe does not use
        electrolyte. Yes, that is true, I also do not use electrolyte in
        some of my cells. However, Joe’s stream water is full of
        fertiliser from the adjacent farming and so his water does have
        electrolyser in it even though he does not add it himself. </p>
      <p>Just think about it please, Joe can pass 25 amps at 12 volts
        through his cell! No electrolyser? Yeah right! </p>
      <p>All natural water has chemicals in it, and this chemistry will
        reduce the resistance ( conductance ) of the water and thus
        increase the current flow. </p>
      <p>Water that does not have electrolyte in it ( artificially made
        water ), has such a high resistance ,that at 12 volts, you would
        get hardly any current flow, very low electrolysis and thus no
        bubbles. </p>
      <p>Bubbles mean ( in this instance ) electrolysis and electrolysis
        means current flow and current flow means chemicals! </p>
      <p>Back to the insulators. &lt;g&gt; If the metal shows sign of
        corrosion at the insulator location, you are using the wrong
        insulators. Throw them away. </p>
      <p>If the insulators have gone all slimy and or mushie, you are
        using the wrong insulators. Throw them away. </p>
      <p>Some insulators that have ‘ worked ’ for me and others are; </p>
      <p>* Red chemical rubber bottle stoppers. can make the water go
        red, I don’t like them. </p>
      <p>* The early version of traffic counting air hose, the present
        one is useless. </p>
      <p>* The black hose used for oxygen for welding. Must be the old
        type without the ribbing! </p>
      <p>* Various type of glue sticks. Tend to be too soft. </p>
      <p>* Various types of rubber lines as used in cars. beware, some
        are no good. Not worth the bother. </p>
      <p>* The use of little mica washers on each side of the insulating
        rubbers. These are normally used as insulators for transistors
        when the are mounted on a heat sink. Far better to use the right
        insulators and thus not have to fiddle around with mica as well.
      </p>
      <p>* Ebonite rod shaped to size. My preference. </p>
      <p>* Glass marbles. Very hard to put in, but when in, they do a
        fair job. </p>
      <p>* Silicone hose as used in hospitals and laboratories ( the
        clear stuff ). Works well although a little too soft. </p>
      <p>* Sikaflex. Home made and Joe’s preference. Works as well but
        no better to ebonite in my cells. </p>
      <p>If you get a cartridge of Sikaflex ( marine grade, white ) and
        allow the Sikaflex to cure in the nozzle, you can remove this
        plug and cut it up for a couple of insulators. I am sure that
        with a bit of imagination you can work out a better way of
        making a whole stick at a time. </p>
      <p>When inserting the insulators, place them in three radial rows
        about 120 degrees apart and about a ¼ inch down from the top and
        bottom ends of the cylinders. </p>
      <p><b><i>The Water:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The subject is covered in depth in my manual, so what more can
        I say that may help? </p>
      <p>I must repeat, do not use tap water or any water that has
        chlorine, fluoride, alum, lime or similar additives in it. It
        will not work and will also cover your cylinders with oxides and
        thus stop the cell from ever going stage 3, guaranteed </p>
      <p>I only use spring or rain water, or in desperation a water
        called Noble water and sold in supermarkets in Australia. The
        Noble water is guaranteed chemical free and it works to a degree
        but is a very slow starter and seems to die or as Joe say’s ‘ go
        off ’ quite easily. </p>
      <p>I have no problems in getting a cell to stage three with rain
        or spring water. </p>
      <p>My problems is keeping it at that stage. </p>
      <p>Try an use fresh water and do not store it in the sun or in
        plastic containers. Imagine that you are going to drink it and
        treat it in that fashion. If you would not drink it yourself,
        why do you except the cell to like it? </p>
      <p><b><i>Power Application:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The rules are simple, do not cook the cell, do not overcharge,
        do not use to much current. </p>
      <p>When I wrote my manual, I tried to set some sort of standard
        that all cell experimenters could follow and thus we could all
        compare notes. </p>
      <p>Hah, now that was wishful thinking! </p>
      <p>The standard came from tests by Joe. For example, when he ran
        his cell on his son’s Escort, he had an ammeter in series with
        the cell and it was indicating 1.26 amps. </p>
      <p>So, 12 volts and 1 amp seemed like a nice all round figure to
        use as a standard. However, as I soon found out, this
        information was translated in so many different rules and
        methodologies by all and sundry, that any attempt to maintain
        some sort of uniformity was a waste of time. </p>
      <p>This must reflect normal human nature as we can see by simply
        looking at all the different standards in the audio and video
        fields to name a couple. </p>
      <p>Since those days I have changed my recommendations to allow all
        people to do their own thing. </p>
      <p>Simply stated, you should pass about a ¼ to q ½ of an amp
        through your cell with NO electrolyte. If you do not see some
        action with 2 minutes, turn if off and look for a problem. </p>
      <p>I repeat, there is no point in going on, if it has not shown
        signs of action in 2 minutes, it never will. </p>
      <p>HOWEVER --- and this is a very important fact --- The cell may
        behave differently every time you reapply the power. Only a
        stable cell ( fairly rare creature ) will behave the same way on
        each power reapplication. </p>
      <p>To repeat the above, an unstable cell may produce different
        behaviours each time you reapply the power. A stable cell will
        start in the same mode each time. </p>
      <p>Depending on the conductivity of the water, you may find that
        you will need up to 250 volts to get this ¼ to ½ amp current
        flow. I have found that generally 75 volts is a good ball park
        figure with my types of water. </p>
      <p>Obviously if you want to use the cell in a car, you will have
        to play with the electrolyte as mentioned in my manual, as you
        have no control on the voltage ( about 14.9 volts is as high as
        you will get ). </p>
      <p>On the power supply topic, please read my paper on negative
        electricity, as this is the requirement for the stage 4 cell. At
        this time , I have been unable to make one, and as Joe is not
        telling, it may take me a bit longer to come up with the design.
      </p>
      <p>At the moment I am working on a Tesla switch ( Bedini two
        capacitor concept ) as a power supply for the cell. I will let
        you all know if I come up with something. </p>
      <p><b><i>Cell Observation:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Some things to look for in a stage 3 cell: </p>
      <p>* All cylinders should stay clean, on BOTH sides. </p>
      <p>* The cell will ‘ remove ’ out of the water what it does not
        want . This ‘ scum ’ should be either at the top or bottom of
        the cell and not on the cylinders. </p>
      <p>* You should filter this ‘ scum ’ out of the water and keep
        reusing the water that the cell is converting. Only top it up,
        do not replace it unless you are not getting anywhere with the
        cell. </p>
      <p>* You should see very small bubbles rising from both side of
        the cylinders. </p>
      <p>* The top surface of the water should develop an oily type film
        (surface tension). This will only occur if you keep the water at
        the right level. </p>
      <p>The right level is meniscus height or just high enough water
        for the bubbles to freely flow on the total surface of the
        water. Obviously you should keep the cell level to achieve this.
      </p>
      <p>* The cell should never get hot or even warm. </p>
      <p>* On turning the power off, the tiny bubbles should form little
        islands that may be turning in a clockwise or anticlockwise
        direction or some one way and others the opposite way. </p>
      <p>* The bubbles should not simply rise to the surface. You should
        see the tiny bubbles following eddies and meandering all over
        the place. For example they may be travelling in one direction
        between one set of neutrals and travelling the opposite
        direction in the next gap. </p>
      <p>* When the cell is charged you will notice a North/South
        magnetisation in the vertical plane. This is normal and a good
        sign. On removal of the water this field should disappear. </p>
      <p>The above is what I do and what I have observed with my stage 3
        cells. You should do and see very similar results. If not, go
        through my points and see where the discrepancy is. That may be
        your problem. </p>
      <p>Good luck and don’t give up, if I can do it so can you, my only
        trick is persistence. Stick with one cell until you are sure
        that it is faulty, there is no point in changing things just for
        the sake of changes. </p>
      <p>The above cell does work and has worked for many. After you are
        familiar with the above basic cell, then and only then move into
        the construction of the specialised versions. </p>
      <p>Learn to walk before you attempt to run, saves you from falling
        flat on your face. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">AIM</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>To get the plates in ‘ equilibrium ’ ( as Joe calls it ). </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>THEORY</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>According to Joe, both sides of the neutrals have to be in
        equilibrium. To achieve this, he drives the negative to the
        positive and the positive to the negative. </p>
      <p>In the above, Joe’s use of the word drive indicates his
        observation of the bubbles and water formation as he manipulates
        the applied potential’s on the various cylinders, thus he is ‘
        driving ’ them. </p>
      <p><i>Comment:</i> </p>
      <p>A longer term means of observing these ‘ potential’s ’ on the
        plates is observing the build up ( or lack thereof ) of an oxide
        or ‘ colour ’ on the surface of the plates. </p>
      <p>As mentioned in my manual, the cylinders should stay clean on a
        working cell. The danger of this statement is, that a shorted or
        incorrectly functioning cylinder will also display this
        characteristic. </p>
      <p>However, by the observation of the resultant bubbles, water
        forms and of course the cell function, you will easily
        distinguish between good and bad cylinders. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>METHOD</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>1. Connect your negative to the inner, central tube. </p>
      <p>2. Connect your positive to the first neutral ( next tube ). </p>
      <p>3. Shift the positive from the first neutral to the second
        neutral. </p>
      <p>4. Continue this process until your positive is now on the
        outer tube ( or container of the cell ) </p>
      <p><b><i>Notes:</i></b> </p>
      <p>A. --- Leave the potential on the tubes until you obtain the ‘
        right ’ bubble production but no longer than 1 minute no matter
        what the outcome. If it does not ‘ work ’, look for problems
        elsewhere. </p>
      <p>B. --- Clip your leads so that the negative connection is
        always in line , but as far apart as possible from the positive
        connection. For example, clip the negative to one end of the one
        inch tube and the positive to the diametrically opposite end of
        the two inch ( next ) tube. </p>
      <p>C. --- You can swap and change the above sequence and
        polarities until you achieve the desired effect, BUT always end
        up with the negative to the central tube and positive to the
        outer. </p>
      <p>D. --- The ‘ right ’ bubble formation is unfortunately an
        observational skill that comes with a lot of practice, and would
        be next to impossible to write in words. </p>
      <p>For beginners, you will have to use the very crude method of
        igniting the bubbles to differentiate amongst the various gas
        types until you get the ‘ eye ’ to see. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>REMARKS</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This note is required at this time, as there seems to be quite
        a fair bit of disinformation ( deliberate or otherwise )
        circulation on the Web. </p>
      <p>Please read my lips, hear and listen, no matter if you live on
        the North pole, South pole or anywhere in between, on completion
        of start up, you must leave the negative connection to the
        middle of the cell, ( the most inner tube ). </p>
      <p>Now there seems to be many ‘ advisers ’ recommending negative
        to the outer tube ( case ), as they get pretty bubbles, vortex
        actions and similar. That is all great, BUT do they have a
        working cell? </p>
      <p>No, they do not, I can guarantee it, as you must have the
        negative to the central tube to do so. </p>
      <p>I will give you a very short reason, so at least you will tend
        to believe me, but in reality you have free will and you can do
        what you like. I am merely an advisory sign, to be used as you
        see fit. </p>
      <p>Electricity is always trying to destroy it’s dipole, it is
        constantly trying to eliminate the positive and negative
        potential differential. Magnetism on the contrary is forever
        trying to establish a North and South magnetic pole differential
        ( as far apart as possible ). This is an endless and balanced
        battle between electricity and magnetism that has been going on
        since the start of creation. </p>
      <p>As a result of this ‘ battle ’, negative is a contractive
        energy and positive is an expanding energy. As we are trying to
        accumulate a force and thus create a ‘ frequency ’ with our
        cells, it is obvious ( to me at least ) that the contracting
        force should be inside and the expanding force on the outside.
        How else can you possibly draw anything in? </p>
      <p>Reverse the potential’s and positive ( the expanding force ) in
        trapped in the middle of the cell by the contracting negative
        force. Not the way to go! No wonder that you have pretty signs
        of this battle. Similar to the sign ( smell ) that you get when
        you drive your car with your handbrake on. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Before I wade into the subject proper, let me remind you that
        maybe your concept of electricity as taught in school may be a
        little suspect. For example, we talk of electric generators.
        This conjures the image of electricity being made. So if you
        imagine the normal scenario of a city using a remotely located
        power ‘ generator’, located at some distance from the city (
        this may be many miles away ), it implies that the ‘ generated
        ’electron has to travel to the city to be utilised. </p>
      <p>Further, as most power generators now utilise alternating
        current ( AC ), that means that the polarity is positive for one
        ½ cycle and negative for the other ½ cycle. We now have a
        problem. </p>
      <p>We have the ludicrous situation where our poor electron ( after
        being generated ), leaves the country and starts it’s trip
        toward the big smoke. But due to distance, it does not get there
        as the voltage has been reversed ( for the other half cycle )
        and our poor little traveller has to return to the power
        station! Thus no power gets to the city if the ‘ generator ’ is
        of a sufficient distance from the load ( or consuming device ).
      </p>
      <p>Obviously something wrong with the generator theory somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>Let me say from the outset, that electricity cannot be made or
        used up by man. Electricity is not a substance as such, and you
        may have to rethink some of the accepted views. </p>
      <p>There is a ‘ magic ’ triangle that is made up of electricity,
        magnetism and gravity. </p>
      <p>The Joe cell can tap into this triangle ( imagine the cell
        energy as being in the middle of the triangle ) and changing the
        balance of the ‘ sides ’ can thus have full control of
        transmutation, gravity and many other effects. </p>
      <p>If you imagine the cell ‘ force ’ as a very high frequency AC
        voltage, ( NOT A GAS! ) you may realise that a power supply
        designed to ‘ fill ’ the cell with this type of energy would be
        a far superior way to go as compared to a conventional power
        supply or a standard car battery that has a far more meagre
        contribution of this type of ‘ electricity’. </p>
      <p>Never-the-less, you can make a very good cell indeed without
        resorting to a special power supply. </p>
      <p>Before I forget, let me again remind you that when Joe is
        talking about a negative field around the outside of the cell,
        he is not talking about placing your negative lead to the outer
        container. He is referring to ‘ true negative ’ or negative
        electricity, NOT to be confused with standard electrical
        potential’s of positive and negative. </p>
      <p>Thus after finishing with your start up procedures on the cell
        ( see related paper ), ALWAYS finish with the negative lead
        connected to the central ( inner ) cylinder. </p>
      <p>As said many times, there are no exception to this rule, on
        this planet at least. &lt;g&gt; </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>SOME SCIENCE</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Nuclei with a positive charge and electrons with a negative
        charge has long been regarded as the </p>
      <p>‘ norm ’ and is how present science see the world and the
        matter that it is composed of. </p>
      <p>However, as we live in an illusionary world , reality is
        sometimes the direct opposite of what our far from perfect
        senses relay to us as concrete facts. </p>
      <p>For example, we all ‘ know ’ that the railway lines do not
        really meet at the distant horizon, and we also ‘ know ’ that a
        city floating in the air is merely a mirage. </p>
      <p>Thus we also ‘ know ’ that there is only one type of
        electricity, the normal one that we all use and have measured
        with test equipment ad nauseam. </p>
      <p>But what if there are in actuality negative nuclei and positive
        electrons ( positrons )? Another parallel so called world, a
        mirror of all that we see as normal and thus ‘ fact ’. Yes, we
        would have atoms and the mirror anti-atoms, and these would form
        anti-molecules and finally anti-life. Exactly the same as we see
        normality. but simply a mirror image. </p>
      <p>Of course this would also apply to electrical charge,
        magnetism, etc. </p>
      <p>Before you say that all this is old news and that I should come
        up to speed, let me say that I am aware of the particles made by
        particle accelerators such as at CERN in Geneva, and yes, I am
        also aware of the use of positrons as in the technique called
        PET ( positron emission tomography ). And I have read the works
        of P. A. M. Dirac and his famous quantum theory calculations in
        1929. </p>
      <p>Yes, it was Dirac who postulated that particles and
        antiparticles have identical masses but opposite charges. </p>
      <p>When these little fellows get to meet, they annihilate each
        other and as a result charges are neutralised and the masses are
        converted to energy. </p>
      <p>Please remember this fact for my theory section at the end of
        this paper. </p>
      <p>This energy can be X-ray photons, gamma rays or mesons. </p>
      <p>Whilst on the subject and to put some perspective to the
        energies involved, let me quote you an example. The rate at
        which solar energy ( solar radiant power or luminosity ) reaches
        the Earth is about one kilowatt on each square meter. This is
        very useful and useable power indeed, and also goes to show the
        very poor efficiency of present day solar panels. </p>
      <p>Back to the subject. What has all this to do with the cell and
        who really cares? </p>
      <p>Please be patient, a brick wall is erected a brick at a time.
        &lt;g&gt; </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>PROOF?</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>So, what do we know about negative electricity in relation to
        the Joe cell? </p>
      <p>Of course we have Joe’s words on the topic as relayed to us by
        his many visitors, but as this is the talk of the ‘ inventor ’,
        we really require some other ‘ proof ’ that is independent of
        possible bias or deliberate inaccuracy. </p>
      <p>At this point, let me remind the reader that Joe has not put
        one word on paper ( over a 10 year period ), or allowed one
        photograph to be taken ( not from lack of asking by myself and
        others ), that may be used to help resolve the dilemma. </p>
      <p>On the contrary, Joe has gone to great lengths to hide his ‘
        secret ’, by evading the topic or by giving nonsensical answers
        to questions and sometimes even laying down deliberate smoke
        screens to further confuse the issue. He obviously has his
        reasons and I respect his right not to share his discoveries
        with us. God bless you Joe. </p>
      <p>In passing, the videos that are in circulation are poor quality
        videos made by amateurs for friends, and that have been
        circulated without Joe’s consent. </p>
      <p>As such it has been left to a few to try to convert the crumbs
        that fall from Joe’s table into a loaf of bread that can feed
        the rest of the world. </p>
      <p>As mentioned at the start, positrons are a fact of life in the
        scientific community, but of course the scientific community
        will not recognise the Joe cell. In fact talk about the cell in
        scientific circles will guarantee a belly laugh, scorn or simply
        result in you being ostracised and treated similar to a person
        who is reporting on a UFO sighting. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, things are very different amongst the
        clandestine research scientists, but then of course these dudes
        are not going to come out in public, put their arm around you
        and declare on national TV that you are on the right track.
        Sorry, life was not meant to be easy. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately I have to resort to various ‘ proofs ’ that
        result from many experiments performed by ‘ pseudo scientist ’.
        This is meant to be a derogatory term as used by the ‘ certified
        experts ’ as a description of thousands of honest and dedicated
        self taught individuals that devote their whole lives to a
        radical project, ( usually with no help or money ) but usually
        with very noble aims. </p>
      <p>My favourite and a very enlightened individual whose work (
        like Tesla ) has not received the accolades that it deserves is:
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>WALTER RUSSELL</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Born in Boston in May 19, 1871. He started experiencing annual
        periods of illumination. During a 39 day period of illumination
        in 1921, he believed he received the secrets of the universe
        from God, which he was asked to share with the world. In 1948 he
        married Lao Russell, and together they founded the University of
        Science and Philosophy for the purpose of spreading these
        teachings throughout the world. </p>
      <p>Russell passed away in 1963 and Lao in 1988. </p>
      <p>As we know ( if you believe in the subject that is ), there has
        been many avatars walking this earth and spruiking all forms of
        truths and otherwise. However, there is a great scarcity of
        individuals that have been told the scientific facts by ‘ God ’
        and as such we should pay very careful attention to what they
        have to say. </p>
      <p>That is of course after first proving to the best of our
        abilities that the individuals are not deluded and merely not
        taking their medication. </p>
      <p>From what Russell has demonstrated by deed and word, I for one
        am a very serious listener to his scientific views. Russell has
        written many books on the topic and as far as the cell research
        is concerned, negative electricity has a very good ( and very
        difficult to comprehend ) write up in his book " The Universal
        One ". </p>
      <p>Some of his thoughts on the different types of electricity. </p>
      <p>* Positive electricity is the generative electricity. </p>
      <p>Positive electricity is that state of motion in which
        electricity dominates magnetism. </p>
      <p>Positive electricity is that state of motion in which
        centripetal force dominates centrifugal force. </p>
      <p>* Negative electricity is the radiative energy. </p>
      <p>Negative electricity is that state of motion in which magnetism
        dominates electricity. </p>
      <p>Negative electricity is that state of motion in which
        centrifugal force dominates centripetal force. </p>
      <p>* Electricity and magnetism exist as separate appearances only
        when opposed. In non-opposition they disappear, they become one.
      </p>
      <p>* Electricity and magnetism are not two separate forces, nor
        are they two separate substances. They are merely two different
        dimensions of motion. They belong solely to motion and not to
        substance. </p>
      <p>* Neither are positive and negative electricity two kinds of
        electricity. Positive and negative electricity are but two
        differing potential’s of the same force which must move in
        opposite directions. </p>
      <p>As I said, Russell has written many books and it would take a
        life time of very serious reading to fully comprehend what he is
        trying to pass to us. I am only relaying on to you sufficient to
        formulate a theory that I hold. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>RELATED DEVICES</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>If you have been in the ‘ alternative energy ’ scene for a
        while, you will no doubt be aware of many, many experimenters
        working on many devices. </p>
      <p>I will not bore you with a long list of experimenter’s and
        their related research. </p>
      <p>You can very easily look up your favourite experimenter by
        simply using the Web and a suitable search engine. Please
        realise that all you read is not fact and that there are a lot
        of grey areas, including in what you are reading now. Sorry, I
        am doing my best, but I am fallible. &lt;g&gt; </p>
      <p>You can use Nikola Tesla, John Bedini, John Searl, Floyd Sweet,
        Robert Adams and Edwin Gray as representative examples of the
        inventors that I am talking about. </p>
      <p>However, you will notice that some peculiarities as displayed
        by the cell are common to many of these devices. To name a few,
        the device goes cold when operating, the device shows magnetic
        anomalies in the near vicinity of the experiment, the device may
        be surrounded with a blue or pink glow, the device will build up
        a very strong ‘ electric ’ charge and the device may display
        some form of gravity anomalies. </p>
      <p>Different cells made by many different experimenter’s, and
        located in various parts of the world, have displayed some or
        all of the above anomalies. </p>
      <p>For the purpose of this short paper, I will stick to the
        electrical portion of the cell anomalous behaviour. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>THEORY</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I will place here some points that you may want to consider. As
        usual it is early days in this research and as usual I will have
        the people in the know ( like Joe ) laughing their heads off at
        my puny attempts, but at least it is an attempt and it may seed
        a far better idea that you may have. </p>
      <p>Please share it, do not sit on it like Joe and many other
        selfish individuals. </p>
      <p>* A high frequency cell generated or accumulated force will
        create a magnetic field. This is easily proven with a compass or
        a magnet on a piece of string. The cell’s stainless steel tubes
        that you did such a good job of testing for magnetism, will now
        have a very strong North South field in the vertical axis. And
        this field is not in the steel, for when you pour out the water
        the cell will go back to ‘ normal ’. </p>
      <p>From the above, I assume that the resonant field ( and thus
        this magnetism ) is a function of the resonant cavity of which
        the water forms an integral part, ie. no water, no magnetism. </p>
      <p>In simple terms we have what is commonly called a ‘ tank
        circuit’ and this tank circuit is generating a unique magnetic
        field that is DIFFERENT from a magnetic field created by a
        steady DC ( direct current ) as may be created by a normal car
        battery. </p>
      <p>Tesla referred to it as a ‘ hysterical ’ magnetic field. As
        referred to hysteresis and not to somebody that has lost the
        plot. &lt;g&gt; </p>
      <p>* The magnitude of the above hysterical field is the
        unbalancing of the three force triangle towards the
        gravitational effects and explains the Joe cell gravitational
        anomalies ( to me at least ). </p>
      <p>To rephrase the above, if the balance of the two forces (
        electricity and magnetism ) is upset or if you could nearly
        remove one of them, gravity as we call it would be negated. </p>
      <p>Walter Russel stated that the electro-magnetic process of mass
        formation ( centripetal ) is balanced by the attractive power of
        electricity and the dissipating ( centrifugal ) repelling power
        of magnetism. </p>
      <p>* Please remember that our teacher is Nature. Nature does her
        tricks with simple elegance and thus is using the proper energy
        efficient tools. As you can see by the above example we only
        have to upset the electro-magnetic balance and enormous power is
        at our disposal. </p>
      <p>The Joe cell can do this and you have to respect the logic of
        some of the individuals who are hell bent on keeping the methods
        secret from the rest of us. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>ENGINE EXAMPLE</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>As most people are interested in running an engine on the cell,
        let me show you the balance of the two forces, again with thanks
        to Walter Russell. </p>
      <p><b>Intake stroke. Compression stroke</b> </p>
      <p>Negative, expanding. Positive, contracting </p>
      <p>Negative, cooling system Positive, heating system </p>
      <p>Negative, increasing volume Positive, lessening volume </p>
      <p>Negative, discharging Positive, charging </p>
      <p>Negative, opening spirals Positive, closing spirals </p>
      <p>Negative, lowering potential’s Positive, increasing potential </p>
      <p>Negative, radiating Positive, generating </p>
      <p>What am I on about? Let me tell you. </p>
      <p>When a piston is at the top of the compression stroke, the
        compressed air molecules are ‘ charging ’ and require an ‘
        increase in potential ’ or in other words, they need additional
        electrical charge or as Joe like to say, more electrons. </p>
      <p>These are supplied to a large degree from the cylinder walls.
        But, let us assume that the Joe cell has somehow removed all ‘
        spare ’ electrons from the engine block. What now? Where do you
        get them from, as surely you must? </p>
      <p>Would it be possible for the compressed air to behave
        differently and maybe contribute some negative ( mirror )
        electricity ( as in the science section above )? We know as a
        scientific fact that the annihilation of the two different
        particle masses ( the normal and the mirror ) contribute energy.
      </p>
      <p>This resultant energy may cause an expansion of the captured
        air charge and thus result in the ‘ push ’ that pushes the
        piston down. Why not? </p>
      <p>On this line, Russell stated that a sudden lowering of
        potential would cause an explosion, a flame or a luminous
        streak. Good enough for me, you of course can make you own
        assumptions. </p>
      <p>Again on the same subject, please remember that Joe stated that
        a spark plug ignition was not required, only the
        electro-magnetic pulse at the right time from the car coil ( a
        crude form of a Tesla coil ). </p>
      <p>Remember my theory ( like hundreds of others ) is an unproven
        fact, and you are more than welcome to modify and improve on my
        humble contribution. That is called science. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This article is here to make you think, comprehend and maybe
        lead you to some answers. </p>
      <p>I feel very comfortable with the notion that the Joe cell ( and
        similar devices ) utilises a form of energy that is the same (
        in many ways ) as a mysterious energy that has appeared for many
        other experimenters and equally baffled them. </p>
      <p>In all cases, the energy ‘ appeared ’ due to a manipulation of
        electricity and magnetism. </p>
      <p>I also believe that the source of this energy is present
        everywhere in abundance, and is the only energy that we should
        be using, and is our only hope in saving mankind and Mother
        Earth. </p>
      <p>I also think that the Joe cell is the simplest and most elegant
        way of accumulating and utilising this great gift from our
        Creator. I have dedicated my life to this quest, and I feel very
        humble in the Lord allowing me to be a very small player in the
        experimenting with, and the resultant sharing of my research
        with my fellow brothers. </p>
      <p>My last word on the subject is that unless we all share the
        work and thus become a force to be reckoned with, the few but
        extremely powerful moguls will always keep us in bondage and
        ignorance. </p>

      <p>Being a completely non-scientific type, and having spent many,
        many enjoyable and sometimes confusing hours watching Joe’s
        video and reading the books by Barry and Alex, I thought it just
        might be helpful to new builders to document my experiences. </p>
      <p>My advice to you is to watch that video, and read both those
        books, and of course, read what I have to say. It may not be of
        any use to you at all, but it might. </p>
      <p>This is an account of what works for me. </p>
      <p>I particularly wish to thank Alex and Barry for their work, and
        Joe for his and for passing on the wonderful information. And
        there is one other person I wish to thank. Guess who? </p>

      <p>Before we get into the real guts stuff, some of you may get a
        wee bit confused. If so email me. Please keep it short and
        precise. I would like an intro as to who and where you are. I
        think that is fair, don’t you? <b>rencells@yahoo.com.au</b> </p>
      <p>This is it. This is for me and for you. This is for all the
        people who just want to get on with doing it. Doing what?
        Building those funny little things that people call Joe Cells. </p>
      <p>Now let’s get it right, right from the start. What you are
        going to build is not a Joe cell. It is an orgone, or
        Life-force, accumulator that uses water as a medium. Joe’s cells
        are Joe cells, mine are Ren cells, and you will have your own.
        Mary cells, Dave cells, whatever. </p>
      <p>I need to point out now, that as you proceed with this little
        adventure of yours, you are going to discover some rather
        amazing things. Amazing things about water and weather and
        orgone and aether, and stainless steel and rubber and magnets
        and electricity. But most of all, you are going to discover
        stuff about you. You will also win new friends and sometimes you
        will wish you hadn’t. You may have unexpected guests on your
        computer or in the sky close by, who are unwelcome. You should
        hope for a visit from someone you do not want to see. You are
        embarking, my friend, on the voyage of a lifetime. </p>
      <p>Come on, let’s get to work. I am going to show you how I do it.
        I build cells as close to the way Joe does as I know how. I
        build the Mark 3 (5 inch) cell and the Mark 4 (4 inch) cell. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+2">Cones and Kegs:</font></b> </p>
      <p>I read Barry’s book first and decided that I needed a beer keg
        and those big 10 inch stainless steel cones that are used in
        milk factories. Well I got the keg but never did get the cones.
        I did end up with the smaller cones (5.5 inch) from dairy farm
        milk/cream separators. So being one who is full on most of the
        time I set up my gear. The beer keg was too big so I scored an
        old stainless steel hot water urn, the type they had in the
        smoko room at work before those horrible coffee machines became
        popular. Anyway, a few modifications, like ripping the guts out
        of it and plugging up the holes. Filled it full of water and it
        leaked. Not to be foiled, I found a 20 litre plastic bucket and
        put the whole shebang in. It had taken a lot of fiddling to get
        the cones spaced just right around a piece of PVC pipe. Joe uses
        agricultural pipe, the drainage stuff. For the life of me I
        could not find any small enough to go inside the smaller cones.
        But where there is a will there is a way. </p>
      <p>There is a drawing of the cone/keg set-up in Barry’s book, and
        because I have trouble drawing on these computer machines, I
        will not attempt to replicate it. My cone set-up is modified to
        suit readily available hardware. I have been able to do away
        with the 3 rubber spacers between each pair of cones and this
        new method makes the rig much quicker to dismantle, clean and
        reassemble. </p>
      <p>As you can expect I could hardly wait to hook it on to a car
        battery. So I didn’t. Wait, that is. Yep, hooked it up and
        watched and waited and watched and waited. I did this for a long
        time. The books and the videos don’t say anything much about
        waiting. I will tell you. Impatient blokes like me actually can
        learn to wait, and it hurts when you first start. </p>
      <p>I remember watching the video and there is Joe in the shed with
        the beer keg full of big cones and water, a flick of the switch
        on his electro rectifier something or other machine and then he
        chucks a match in and jumps as some gas explodes. Well I always
        did like matches. My dear old Dad used to reckon there was
        pyromania in the family, I reckon there was some arson about.
        Well I waited some more and watched some more and finally I saw
        tiny little bubbles and a smoky sort of cloud in the water. </p>
      <p>After a while there was some brown flaky stuff starting to
        float around and drift to the top. I let it stay there. Hours
        later it was thicker and there were bubbles trapped in it. That
        was when I got match happy. Just could not resist it. Well I
        blew up some bubbles that I thought would be loud but weren’t. I
        blew up some that I thought would fizz but instead they cracked,
        some rather loudly. I blew up bubbles in the centre, in the
        middle, along the outside. I went through a lot of matches and a
        lot of time waiting for more bubbles to return, just to explode
        them. I did as Joe does and learned to take the scum off without
        losing the charge from the water. I would leave the thing alone
        for a couple of days sometimes and come back. I did it for
        months and enjoyed myself immensely. </p>
      <p>In the meantime I also learned that it is not too hard to burn
        the cones, and the water. A few times I have forgotten to take
        the power off to the unit and it produced some really vile
        looking green and inky black muck below the layer of brown
        sludge. I am talking about three distinct layers over half an
        inch thick each. And lovely clean water underneath. </p>
      <p>I have learned that cleaning the gear often does not hurt. In
        fact I did find that the more often it is cleaned, and the more
        it is used in shortish bursts, the better the unit works. </p>
      <p>And then one day I poked a match into a tiny little bubble, out
        by the edge, all by itself. When that went off there was an
        extremely loud "crackthud" sound and all the brown scum was
        blown off the surface of the water. All over the roof of the
        shed, one of the walls, and me. My ears had popped, implosion,
        duckz gutz. Naturally I was frozen in place. My lady wife and
        young blokes came running, "Dad, Dad, are you alright?" And
        there I am still standing there with a dead match in my hand and
        stupid grin on my face. Oh yes, friend, I was very alright. </p>
      <p>As time went by I was able to get the water to a stage where I
        could get those sounds nearly every time. It was about then that
        I noticed the weather seemed to effect the speed of charging and
        also the types of sounds I could get. I have been able to detect
        five different sounds. Some explosions have bursts of orange
        flame, some blue, some bright golden yellow, and some have no
        flame detectable with the naked eye. Some are lightening speed
        and some just seem to make a sheet of blue across the entire
        surface of the water. I also began to notice that clouds could
        come out of nowhere when I was charging, and sudden wind gusts.
      </p>
      <p>Yes, charging water and exploding bubbles was fun, and time
        consuming. </p>
      <p>But I found out that I had been wasting time. For a bloke with
        one or two cells, a cone/keg rig is not essential, in fact it is
        really only good for having fun with, being a bit of a larrikin
        etc. It can also show the changes water goes through when
        electricity is applied in certain ways. Nice to have, but not
        essential, an option for you. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">THOUGHTS on CELLS:</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Well back to the story. So you want to know about cells.
        Wonderful things, and so many different ideas as to what
        constitutes a good cell. </p>
      <p>The purpose of having a cell is to charge water to a certain
        state. By charge I do not mean getting it to a stage where we
        are producing gallons of gas, far from it. The purpose of a cell
        is not to produce gas. Gas is a by-product of the process. Gas
        bubbles can be, and are, used to identify the state of the
        charge of the cell and the water. We do not want too much gas.
        That is for the folks who can’t get a car to run on the
        Life-force. The charging process will provide enough gas to do
        what we want. More on that later. </p>
      <p>Accompanying this manual is a drawing at the back of the Mark
        4. The Mark 3 is almost identical. The only difference is that
        the Mark 3 has one extra neutral cylinder (pipe or tube) and is
        therefore an inch larger in diameter. It is also more expensive
        to build, harder to install in a car, heavier, and takes a lot
        longer to charge. </p>
      <p>Joe intended the Mark 4 cell to be filled with water charged in
        the cone/keg rig. I have done it once or twice but no longer
        bother. A properly built Mark 4 cell is extremely capable of
        charging it’s own water, and in fact seems to prefer to do it
        that way. </p>
      <p>It is my opinion, and not verified, that each cell develops
        it’s own frequency. And I also believe that each cone/keg rig
        has it’s own frequency. Why cause possible problems by adding
        water that has been charged in a keg and may be at a different
        frequency to what the cell will try to get to on its own? </p>
      <p>Problems are to be avoided. Your own cell technology needs to
        be kept simple until you are way along the track. Too many
        blokes never build cells because they get bogged down in the
        theory. Just build your cell. The theory can come later. I don’t
        worry about what other people think of my methods, neither
        should you. OK, a scientist may well have good reason to say
        that I go about things backwards. But that is only from his
        perspective. From my perspective, and because I have no idea
        about science, my way of doing things is logical. If it turns
        out that the cell works, why bother about knowing all the
        theory. </p>
      <p>Incidentally, I have not had a scientist tell me that I do
        things backwards. I did have a CSIRO scientist indicate that he
        was puzzled that I had so little knowledge of the science
        involved. But he also said that science does not recognize
        orgone as a valid subject, so he could not have known anything
        about it either. Caused me to wonder where he was coming from. </p>
      <p>I have had another scientist tell me I work by intuition.
        Sounds fair to me. Thanks Alex. </p>
      <p>So, my advice to you is to build a Mark 4 cell, don’t bother
        with a cone/keg rig unless you feel like playing with matches. </p>
      <p>I would like to reiterate, a Mark 4 cell is not only capable of
        charging it’s own water, it actually seems to prefer water that
        is charged in and by itself. </p>
      <p>I believe that when we charge water in a cell, over a period of
        time the stainless steel gets accustomed to being tickled by a
        trickle of electricity and actually comes to like it. And the
        stainless steel somehow develops a form of "memory". </p>
      <p>When you build your own cell and are ready to start charging,
        you had better get ready to start watching. Watch for bubbles
        around the top of the smallest pipe. This centre pipe is the
        negative. It is also called the cathode. That is where you are
        first going to see bubbles. </p>
      <p>The first time you hook a car battery to your cell you will
        most likely have to wait a minute, even longer maybe, before you
        see any bubbles at all. However, as your cell gets used over a
        period of time with lots of short applications of battery power,
        you will notice that even with new water the bubbles will begin
        to appear more quickly. My trusty old Mark 4 produces bubbles in
        new water in less than 10 seconds, sometimes in 2. </p>
      <p>What about building a cell? OK, I will get on to that now. </p>
      <p>Read on. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">BUILDING THE CELL</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>I prefer to use 316 L stainless steel, and seamless if at all
        possible. But for starters, use anything you can get your hands
        on, just get started. </p>
      <p>The first thing I really do need to explain is "cost". There is
        a lot of talk about cost. I have received numerous emails from
        people saying they are wanting to build a joecell and will get
        to it as soon as they have some money. Money? How much money?
        I’ll tell you in a while. </p>
      <p>Back to my cells. I built a Mark 4, because I had the bits. I
        built it and started charging it just to see if a Mark 4 would
        do the same thing as a Mark 3 was designed for. </p>
      <p>There is also a lot of talk about using recycled stainless
        steel from scrap yards. I did that too. In fact my first cell
        was made out of scrap; it was as rough as guts and it cost me
        ten dollars. It was a combination of the Mark3 and the Mark 4.
        It had a 5 inch outer casing. That outside casing is your
        positive, or anode. But you know that because you have already
        looked at the plans at the back of the manual. And if you
        haven’t done that yet, then maybe you had better do it now. </p>
      <p>Getting back. Inside the outer casing was the cathode (-) and
        two neutrals. The cathode was 200 mm long, not 8 inches, 200 mm
        long and an inch in diameter. Because that is what I had. The
        first, or inner neutral was also 200 mm and 2 inches dia, but
        the outer neutral had horrible jagged bits on the bottom, was 5
        inches long on one side and 7.5 inches long on the other. It had
        a diameter of 3 inches. In theory, and according to the books it
        could not work. Heh heh heh. But it did, sort of. </p>
      <p>I had rammed a stainless steel bolt up into the bottom of the
        cathode. That bolt can be a mounting bolt to your vehicle, but
        more importantly for now it is the negative terminal into the
        cell. It must be insulated from the positive outer casing, and
        it must be watertight where the bolt passes through the bottom
        of the case. You will end up trying all sorts of things hoping
        to insulate that bolt and seal the opening. You may use
        combinations of things. You may get flash and have a
        custom-built bolt made, with flanges on it and specially
        machined insulators etc. Friend, that sort of silly business is
        overkill. I use rubber that I ripped out of wrecked cars at the
        local dump. There are beaut bits with holes in them that you can
        find in engine compartments. I have used bits of old inner tube
        and pieces of electrical conduit. If your bolt is the right
        diameter you may be able to use the white plastic (or PVC or
        nylon) olives that are used in copper pipe fittings. Try
        anything, try everything. Just do it. </p>
      <p>Let me stress. With cells the major outlay is time. The
        hardware is not expensive unless you go high tech. I like to do
        it as cheaply as possible, because I have to. </p>
      <p>I had come to believe that nice new stainless steel pipe was
        expensive. I thought I could not afford it. So in the end I
        priced some. I also found out that it pays to shop around. It
        pays to shop around because some stainless steel merchants sell
        it by the metre, others will sell it by the inch. Shop fitters
        who build commercial kitchens can be helpful, so can plumbers
        who do industrial work. Befriend a sheet metal worker, a lathe
        man. </p>
      <p>It pays to look at what you want to build and what you can
        afford. I am very fortunate in that I have two very good mates
        who have also started building cells. Both these blokes have
        donated hardware to the cause. The major financial expense is
        the last one. That is good. It allows you the time to save up
        for the good bit that goes on top, or it allows you the time to
        decide to go low-tech, just to see if it works, and to save the
        bucks. </p>
      <p>Most of my cells are all hand built. The books say get the
        materials lathed. Well that’s fine if you live in the city. It
        also means more dollars unless you can find a friend of a friend
        who has a metal lathe. </p>
      <p>Me? I use a hacksaw with new blades (that’s flash), a file, and
        wet and dry sandpaper. </p>
      <p>It is important to get the ends of the pipes cut off flat, no
        ups and down, cut flat so that when the pipe is sitting on a
        flat surface it stands straight up in the air. No leaning towers
        of Pisa please. </p>
      <p>A hint for the hacksaw jockeys. To get a line around the
        circumference of the pipe, wrap a piece of paper around the
        pipe. Make sure there are no overlaps. The result is a mark that
        will yield a 90 degree cut. Now I usually mark the pipe with a
        ballpoint, but you could use a spray can of paint if you wished.
        When you start cutting, don’t, repeat, do not, try to cut
        straight through. Sure as eggs you will run off line and end up
        with a horrible mess. What I do is just start gently sawing on
        the mark as I slowly rotate the pipe. Keep rotating as you keep
        cutting, then when the end drops off, lightly file off any
        jagged little bits, not forgetting to clean up inside the pipe
        where the saw cut will have pushed a wafer thin amount of
        stainless. I use a small chain saw file for this and finish with
        a few swipes of wet and dry. </p>
      <p>Tools required:- hacksaw and blades, flat file, chain saw file,
        wet and dry sandpaper. </p>
      <p>Now, the bottom. We have to have a bottom on the cell. There
        are cells with flat bums, others have domes and some have cones.
        I use flat bottoms because they are cheap, except for the
        original with the jagged bit. It came from a scrap yard and was
        a thin piece of 5 inch pipe with domed ends welded top and
        bottom. It had a piece of brass rod brazed or whatever they call
        it on to the centre of one domed end. I think this gizmo may
        have been a float of some sort. </p>
      <p>I weld a flat round plate of stainless steel onto the outer
        case for a bottom. I use 316 L stainless electric welding rods
        with an ancient arc welder. This is not the preferred option,
        but it works for me. </p>
      <p>That flat plate for the bottom. It might be helpful if I
        mention that it is a good idea to drill the hole in this before
        you weld it. First you will need to know the size of the hole
        you want. It has to be big enough to take your bolt plus
        whatever you are going to use for an insulator. And please, try
        to make sure the hole is in the centre of your disc. I have one
        that I drilled with my Makita, it is a quarter of an inch off
        centre. It still works, but it annoys me to know it is not as
        good as it could be. Fair dinkum, go to a small engineering
        shop, tell the bloke what diameter hole you want drilled in the
        centre, and 5 minutes later you are on your way home five bucks
        lighter. </p>
      <p>That same bloke can cut your pipes to length, nice and square.
        He is also quite capable of doing any machining you need for
        your top. He can make press fittings from a dome or cone to the
        case. Get a quote off him, see if you can afford it. It can save
        you the time and give you a better result. </p>
      <p>Time to wop it all together. Don’t worry about the top if you
        haven’t got it yet. You still have time, weeks of it, maybe
        months. Look at a set of plans. The ones from Barry’s book or
        the one at the end of this. </p>
      <p>Now you are going to need some insulator/spacers to go between
        the pipes. Let’s get a bit professional here and call the pipes
        cylinders. </p>
      <p>I used bits of car heater hose to start off with, then corks,
        and have finally settled on old oxy/acetylene hose. It is a
        little thin for my cell so I cut off little bits of timber dowel
        and ram them up the holes in the hose. This makes them nice and
        solid, and it works for me. Fancy that. </p>
      <p>You should have cut that hose some where around 10 mm, long and
        you will need three for the top and three for the bottom for
        each gap between the plates. Naturally you will not want any for
        the bottom between the outside neutral and the positive case.
        The bolt will hold the cathode in the centre and you wouldn’t
        have been able to get the spacers in the bottom anyway. </p>
      <p>When fitting the spacers, fit them about half an inch below the
        tops and above the bottoms of the plates and try to keep them
        all at around 120 degrees, in line with each other for
        aesthetics. </p>
      <p>Now plonk it in the case and insulate it and waterproof it.
        Please, please try to waterproof it by mechanical means, not
        goo. Use rubber. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">WATER</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The next step is getting the right water. That’s what I said,
        the right water. Ideally you will find a nice spring out in the
        country. A place where water bubbles up out of the ground.
        Another good source is up near the headwaters of a nice clean
        creek. Where the water swirls and dances and gurgles around
        rocks, maybe down a waterfall or a series of cascades, an area
        where there are still lots of trees. </p>
      <p>You want unpolluted water, and it does not matter if a cow has
        pooped in it, or if there is something dead in it. That is
        organic, and that is alright. It is chemicals that need to be
        avoided. Fertilizer, yuk, but that does not necessarily mean
        that the water is no good. If you live in the country you will
        know where to start looking. If you are a townie you can take
        the opportunity to have a weekend away camping in a national
        park or state forest in the mountains. Take water containers.
        Glass is best. Old flagon bottles with corks or rubber bungs are
        good. Be inventive, seize the opportunity, get the family
        involved and enthused. Start that now. Anyone who is regularly
        going to be in your car needs to get involved and enthusiastic
        now. </p>
      <p>Your water has to be alive. It should have a bond with the
        earth, with the Life-force that causes this earth and everything
        and everybody on it to stay alive. Reich called this "orgone". I
        call it the Life-force, Alex calls it the Life-force. I got the
        name from him. I got a lot of good stuff from Alex. I also got
        his friendship, very, very precious. </p>
      <p>Water. Rain water will charge but it will not hold the charge,
        so forget it. Tap water, about the same. We all think of rain
        water as being pure and fresh. But friend, it can have chemicals
        in it. And it has been out of touch with the earth. The bond has
        been broken. That is the important thing to remember. The bond
        has been broken. The same goes for bottled water. Even if it
        says it is bottled spring water it is likely useless, and old
        and dead. Get the real stuff, living water. Now where have I
        heard "living water" before? </p>
      <p>So, you are back with your water. Get your cell up on a bench.
        What name have you given the cell? Got to have a name. The
        cathode bolt should be poking out the bottom of the case. Get a
        piece of old inner tube, cut a small hole in it for the bolt to
        protrude through. This rubber is an insulator. You will have to
        mount your cell so you can easily and quickly get your
        electrical lead off the cathode. The top of the cell needs to be
        low enough to allow you to see down inside the cell, and watch
        what is happening. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">CHARGING CELLS</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Make certain the tops of the cathode and the neutrals are all
        level with each other before you start charging. For charging
        you can use a car battery or a battery charger or leads from a
        battery that is connected to your charger. If you do not have an
        amp meter, an old style battery charger with an amp meter built
        in will tell you what current the cell draws. </p>
      <p>Before I forget, if you are charging with a battery charger,
        when you turn it off make sure to remove both leads from the
        cell, otherwise the cell may lose it’s charge. </p>
      <p>Now just add water. Fill to just below the level of the tops of
        the cathode and neutrals. Half a mm is just about right. OK?
        Ready? Hope you have your skinny home made set of jumper leads
        handy. Connect the negative at the battery or charger to the
        cathode bolt, and the positive to the top lip of the cell. You
        don’t have a top on it yet. Now watch. </p>
      <p>Within a minute you should be seeing tiny little bubbles rising
        to the surface between the cathode and the first negative. That
        is electrolysis, the very first stage in charging. Any dill can
        do this. Now power off. I only give a Mark 4 cell 3 minutes
        power at a time. After the first 3 minutes I am quite happy to
        charge again for 90 seconds every hour or so. But that is the
        way I do it and other people prefer to charge at a more sedate
        rate. If you apply power for longer than that you can expect to
        get a coating of brown muck on the surfaces of the cylinders.
        That will mean dismantling and cleaning and starting all over
        again. </p>
      <p>I add about a quarter to half a cup of generic white vinegar to
        my water. It makes the water more conductive and helps to keep
        the metal surfaces and the water cleaner for longer. </p>
      <p>After several applications of power, you will begin to notice
        some changes. If you watch you should see the water level begin
        to rise up over the tops of the cylinders. You should also be
        able to see small bubbles forming and adhering to both sides of
        the cylinders. This is as it should be. You may notice what
        looks like tiny little tidal waves racing around between the
        cylinders. And no doubt you will have also noticed some brown
        flakey bits coming up with the bubbles. You can wipe them off
        with a paper towel, just keep your fingers out of the water.
        Fingers in the water will discharge it. </p>
      <p>At some stage you will realise that your water is dirty. That
        is normal. Filter it. I use 2 litre fruit juice bottles for
        funnels. Just cut the bottom off and place it over one of those
        big glass half kilo coffee jars or something similar. Inside the
        funnel you put screwed up or folded up paper towels or coffee
        filters. Now run the water through. You may have to do this a
        dozen times. The particles are fine but as the paper towel
        becomes saturated the holes in the paper get smaller. </p>
      <p>Get your filtering done in less than an hour. Remember that
        water is partly charged. Keep your fingers out of it. Don’t lose
        the charge. </p>
      <p>After filtering and powering up again it is not uncommon to
        notice grey/brown flakes floating around in the newly filtered
        water. This has really worried me in the past. Lately I have
        found an answer, at least it is working for me at the moment. I
        ripped up one of my old cotton T-shirts. I used a quarter of it
        at the bottom of the funnel and the paper towels on top. It
        stopped the flakes. I suspect those flakes were tiny paper
        fibres, and that when the water was charged up again, they
        expanded. </p>
      <p>Now about that T-shirt. It had been a faithful old thing, much
        loved and much worn. It was part of me and I was part of it.
        When I tore it up it was a bit smelly with my perspiration. I
        was going to write sweat, but thought, nope, they don’t want to
        read that. What has a smelly old T-shirt got to do with it? Y
        factor. I was in that T-shirt, now I am in the cell </p>
      <p>As you continue with the charging and filtering, you should
        notice that each time you clean your water the cell seems to be
        responding a little more quickly. And you will also notice that
        the bubbles are getting bigger. And you will hopefully know by
        now that some of those bubbles will remain on the top of the
        water overnight. Now if you decide to check your cell you will
        need to leave it unpowered for at least 24 hours. Take note of
        what the bubbles look like half an hour after you take the power
        off and then compare that with what you have 24 hours later.
        Hopefully most of the bubbles will still be there. </p>
      <p>You will have noticed at the beginning of the charge process,
        (how long ago was that now) that on the first few power ups,
        mist or clouds of minute bubbles wafted across the top of the
        cell, up to about 4 inches above the water. And as time went by
        that stopped happening and you saw the surface of the water
        begin to rise and yet you could still easily see the meniscus
        between the cylinders. And eventually the water broke over the
        tops of the cylinders and now bubbles are getting trapped. They
        no longer launch themselves out of the water. They remain
        trapped. This indicates an increase in surface tension. This
        indicates that something is happening to the molecular structure
        of the water, or for those game to think about it, the atomic
        structure of the atoms that make up the water molecule. </p>
      <p>Now that change in structure is caused by something.
        Electricity from your battery running through your cell and
        through the water is changing the structure of the atoms and is
        creating frequencies. When your cell is at about the right
        frequency, the cell is charged to stage 3., or conversely, when
        the cell is at stage 3, a certain frequency has been reached.
        And it appears that stage 3 is as far as you can charge a cell.
        However there is the beginning of stage 3 and there is the
        deeper stage 3. </p>
      <p>With all charging it pays to watch what is going on. Sometimes,
        even at stage 3 it is helpful to remove the bubbles so you can
        look for the cell’s pulse. </p>
      <p>No, I am not joking, at stage 3 there will be a pulse. Some
        people are supposed to be able to see pulses in between all the
        cylinders. I only ever see them between the cathode and the
        first neutral. When the pulsing first starts I see 12 small
        areas where it looks similar to when you put a hose into a drum
        of water, with the end of the hose under the water level and
        pointing up. Now turn the tap on and adjust the hose so the
        water from the hose is just making the surface of the water
        burble. You will notice how the water from the hose seems to
        roll over on itself and drop to the bottom of the drum. That is
        what a pulse in a cell looks like, with a packet full of ever so
        small bubbles. Please do not confuse this pulse with
        electrolysis surge, they do look similar. </p>
      <p>When I first get these pulses they come at the rate of about
        two per second in all pulse areas. Usually in the next charge
        that pulse rate has decreased, now you will not believe this,
        but it has decreased itself to my heartbeat. Not just the same
        speed, but synchronised. </p>
      <p>Now that is what I call bonding. That will happen I believe, if
        you have a good Y factor going for you. And that synchronised
        pulsing is sort of supernatural. </p>
      <p>Now not being a scientist I could explain what that means to
        me, but that would be giving the game away. You can work it out.
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">HOW IT WORKS / Y FACTOR</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Right, so there I was filtering lovely creek water with a dash
        of vinegar and now a bit of me. I can hear the academics
        screaming from here. So what. My cell is part of me. I put a lot
        of me into that cell. I believe that it can do what I want it to
        do. I have bonded with my cell. </p>
      <p>Now let’s get real here. The cell in itself is just a
        conglomeration of pipes and rubber. It is only water and a dash
        of vinegar that physically goes into it. And then we apply a
        little bit of electricity. OK, what we have here is hardware.
        That is all it is, hardware. But there is something else going
        on. The hardware makes gas, but the aim is not for gas. The aim
        is to get the cell to a condition where it can attract the
        Life-force into it, and encourage the Life-force to accumulate
        in there until it reaches a certain potential. Our next aim is
        to encourage the Life-force to enter into the ugly bits of metal
        we call an engine. </p>
      <p>By now you know we do that by using an alloy tube that goes
        onto the side of the engine. It does not go into the carburetor,
        it does not go into the manifold. It goes onto, onto is the key
        word. </p>
      <p>Our aim is to encourage the Life-force to flow up the tube and
        through the metal of the engine and into the water jacket. We
        build a blank, or blind plug into our connection between the
        cell and the engine. The gas does not go into the engine.
        Hopefully the gas will fill the top of the cell and the tube all
        the way to the engine. And that gas has a certain electrical
        charge that does encourage the Life-force to flow. </p>
      <p>The next step is for the Life-force to charge the water in the
        water jacket of the engine, and that water will then assist in
        making some changes to the materials the engine is made of. The
        engine and the coolant water actually change into something
        else. I do not know what it is, I do not care, I simply wait for
        it to happen. </p>
      <p>All of this talk about Life-force may have started some of you
        wondering what it is all about. Do an Internet search on
        Willhelm Reich, or orgone. Read Alex Schiffers book. There is
        oodles of information available. </p>
      <p>But I have another idea. As you may have guessed by now, I am
        not really a scholar, nor a scientist. But neither am I a
        complete dill. I can have some ideas of my own. I can
        rationalise. So can you. </p>
      <p>It is time to go for the "what-if’s". Let us accept that Reich
        was right (and no one has disproved him) and that there is an
        orgone field traveling around the earth. How did it get there?
        Do you believe that you can tap into that energy field? I hope
        you do. Because this is what the Y factor is all about. Alex
        Schiffer wrote about the Y factor. It does seem that most, if
        not all cell builders accept that the Y factor holds the real
        key to success with a cell of the Joe variety. </p>
      <p>What is the Y factor about? On a very basic level it is about
        integrity, truth and honesty. It is not about financial gain.
        Some of us believe that the Y factor will never be "cracked".
        Some of us believe it has been put there for a purpose. Well if
        it was put there, how, who did it or did it just happen? </p>
      <p>Many of us know, more suspect, that there is another dimension
        involved when we start charging up our cells. Some of us believe
        that we are beginning to move into that dimension as soon as we
        decide to become builders. </p>
      <p>Anyway, it is your cell, not mine, so you are the person to do
        the thinking, ask the questions, and make the decisions. I wish
        you well in this. </p>
      <p>A thing to possibly take note of. My cells would not charge
        properly until I realised that building cells with the goal of
        making money was not on. As soon as I gave up on that idea I
        became successful. </p>
      <p>Lids and outlet pipes, look at Alex’s and Barry’s work. There
        is no need for me to duplicate it. </p>
      <p>And there is something else I need to tell you. Take a deep
        breath. This might hurt. There is a high probability that you
        will never get to run your car with a cell and no petrol. </p>
      <p>There has been a lot of hype about these Joe cells. They don’t
        always work. No matter what you have heard, or been told, or
        read, Joe cells do not always work. In fact they more often will
        not do what they are built to do. There are experts trying to
        figure out how to make every cell work every time. I am not a
        scientist. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font size="+1">RECOMMENDATION</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>My recommendation is to go for the Mark 4. Joe originally built
        the Mark 3 as a cell that would charge it’s own water and would
        then be installed in a vehicle. If my understanding of Barry’s
        book is correct, that Mark 3 cell was meant to be wired to a
        small power supply. This was intended to maintain a charge in
        the cell at times when the orgone level is low, which I am told
        is somewhere around 2 o’clock to 4 o’clock in the morning. It
        seems that even Joe’s own cell was losing its charge at that
        time, and 1.5 volts from a torch battery was seen as the answer
        to the problem. </p>
      <p>And yet another "however". However, not all cells lose their
        charge, or leak. So if your cell does not leak you will not need
        to wire it up in-vehicle. I personally am dead against wiring
        them up in cars. If the cell does not leak it’s charge it is a
        good one, if it does lose it’s charge it is not going to be
        reliable even if you can encourage it to do what you built it to
        do. So then you have the option of starting again or trying to
        turn it into a gas producer. That is probably easier, but is
        still hard, and is not what Joe cells are about. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">CELL STAGES</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In our experimental work on the cell, I have graded the cell
        types with a crude numerical system, ie. stage 1, stage 2 and so
        on. Let me refresh you in case you have forgotten or are a new
        player: </p>
      <p><b><i>Stage 1:</i></b> </p>
      <p>A normal electrolysis cell doing what it does best,
        conventional electrolysis with the production of hydrogen and
        oxygen. This production of gasses follows the well known Faraday
        rules, namely more current , more gas. </p>
      <p>Absolutely useless for what we are working on, and only of any
        use to people that still think that they can obtain more power
        from the resultant conversion of water to gas, than what the
        power requirement is to achieve the separation. I wish you luck,
        you will need it. </p>
      <p><b><i>Stage 2:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The ‘seeding’ of the cell with the new energy. At this stage
        the cell is attempting to initialise the conversion process, but
        due to faulty materials or construction defects or water type,
        etc., etc., the cell will not ‘catch’ or enter its free running
        or breeding mode in the production of the energy. This can be
        equated to trying to push a child on a swing and pushing the
        swing out of synchronism (or with insufficient force) with the
        desired pendulum effect. </p>
      <p><b><i>Stage 3:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The ‘breeding’ stage of the cell: The ‘seeding’ attempt was
        successful (the swing is swinging) and the cell is now
        accumulating and producing the desired energy. The output of the
        cell is greater than the combined design (or otherwise) losses,
        and the cell is useable although very temperamental and thus
        unreliable and not practical for commercial use. At this stage,
        the cell is a ‘laboratory queen’ and is only suitable for proof
        of concept type work, as well as the unreliable production of
        ‘anti-gravity’ and transmutation effects (to mention a couple).
        This stage 3 cell would suffice for the stationary running of a
        water-cooled power plant for example. </p>
      <p><b><i>Stage 4:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The cell (as well as breeding) is now a reliable and
        commercially viable product. It is not affected by power lines
        and similar low level electromagnetic disturbances and is also
        far more immune to "Y" factors and similar external fields. </p>
      <p>The most important characteristic is that the cell is not
        location specific. Of course, this attribute is exactly what you
        need from a reliable car. </p>
      <p>This stage of cell operation is still heavily guarded by the
        very few people that ‘know’ the secrets of positive and negative
        potential utilisation and frequency resonance in association
        with the cell design. </p>
      <p>If you stop and think and consider the staggering implication
        of the mass release of this energy to all and sundry, you may
        then realise why the game became dirty and free energy does cost
        money! </p>
      <p>Please do not be surprised if these individuals do not knock on
        your door, and spoon feed you the details. </p>
      <p><b><i>Stage 5:</i></b> </p>
      <p>This is really not a cell as such. It is the conversion of the
        engine, the water therein and the electrical system of the car,
        with the aim of achieving a cell type effect out of the engine
        itself. Of course this is also the obvious and logical
        conclusion for the experimenter that wanted to run his car on a
        cell. </p>
      <p>To the best of my knowledge, you must have a water cooled
        engine to achieve this ‘enveloping’ engine field and thus it is
        not suitable for air cooled motors. </p>
      <p>As you can easily deduce, if people are secretive with a Stage
        4 cell, I don’t have to tell you how they guard a Stage 5 unit.
        However, if you know how to go Stage 5, they will knock on your
        door for other reasons. </p>
      <p>There are many other types of specialised cells that are not
        relevant to this simple coverage, but I am simply making you
        aware that Stage 5 is not the end of the ball game by a long
        shot. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b><i>Zero Point Energy:</i></b> </p>
      <p>On the temperature scale, absolute zero is -273.15° C or zero
        degrees Kelvin.At this temperature, as there is no ‘ heat ’, the
        capacity for doing work ( energy ) should be zero.Some
        scientists do however agree that as the energy present at his
        temperature is not thermal, it is plausible that there is ‘ Sea
        of Energy ’ or an aether or similar that has short lived ‘
        virtual ’ elementary particles capable of doing ‘ work ’. </p>
      <p>Refer to Dirac (1930), Gamow (1966) and many others as well as
        a short mention in my update ‘ Negative Electricity ’
        (10-12-2001). </p>
      <p>A related book on the engineering principles for Free Energy is
        " Quest For Zero Point Energy " by Moray B. King ISBN:
        0-932813-94-1, published by Adventures Unlimited Press. </p>
      <p><b><i>Conservation of Energy:</i></b> </p>
      <p>To have ‘Free Energy’, we have to break some well established
        laws. But, laws are meant to be broken as and when better laws
        come along to replace the flawed existing ones. Thus the laws of
        thermodynamics and the conservation of energy are not set in
        concrete. If we do not assume that the physical universe that we
        are in is a closed system, we can introduce overdue revisions of
        present laws. The Joe cell is a conversion device that can ‘
        cross ’ over this border or present day laws and extract and
        utilise the endless and unlimited energy that is all around us
        and that the majority ignore. Modern science has finally caught
        up, and now the concepts that the cell works on are not on the
        lunatic fringe, in actuality it follows well defined scientific
        rules. </p>
      <p><b><i>Principle of all ‘Free Energy Devices’:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The devices that do tap into this energy stream all utilise
        similar principles. I will leave it to the reader to pursue
        other devices, but the present topic is on the most elegant ( my
        opinion ) and simplest device of all, the Joe cell. Please try
        to understand these three principles, as all device use them in
        some form or other. </p>
      <p>1. We must have a system that is not in balance or is unstable.
      </p>
      <p>Thus, if we have a stable system or a system in equilibrium,
        there is no reason for the system or cell to do work. Like a
        boulder that has rolled down from the mountain top, once it
        reaches the valley there it stays, static and in balance. </p>
      <p>As Summers stated, " The energy from this storehouse ( ZPE ) is
        available to man free of charge in vast quantities by the simple
        method of changing the electromagnetic Balance ". </p>
      <p>On the bye, he also stated that Orgone or Prana, is an AC
        electrical current pulsating at an extremely high frequency. Now
        that is interesting, keep it in the back of your mind for later
        use. </p>
      <p>So for rule 1, our cell must not be in a stable state, it must
        be seeking an equilibrium or a more stable point just like a
        boulder in motion at the top of the mountain. </p>
      <p>2. We must have a non-liner performance in the conversion. </p>
      <p>This should be fairly evident, for what is the point of getting
        back a result that is equivalent to the work that we have put
        into to get that result. We must have an amplifying effect so
        that a very small input will return a far larger gain. For
        example, it should require a very small push on our 10 ton
        boulder to initiate an enormous amount of energy as the boulder
        seeks equilibrium. </p>
      <p>So for rule 2, our cell must get beyond stage 2 ( the seeding
        stage ) and become a non linear converter or accumulator for the
        ‘energy’. Stage 1 or plain electrolysis is useless and if you
        stay at this stage, you will get either more or less gas
        production, period. </p>
      <p>3. We must have our device (the cell) in a potential source of
        the energy. </p>
      <p>This one is an easy one as all things on this planet are
        constantly surrounded by an endless energy field that only
        requires the right type of conversion device to utilise same. </p>
      <p>So for rule 3, the experimenter does not have to make any
        provisions as the cell is in this field, as is everything else.
      </p>
      <p>As rule 3. takes care of itself, we are left with rule 1 and 2.
      </p>
      <p>The question is, how does the cell and the operator utilise
        these rules for the greatest benefit. In other words, how do we
        tap into the ZPE force? </p>
      <p><b><i>Rule 1:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Think about it, what can we do to the cell to make it unstable
        or out of balance? </p>
      <p>Well, here are some, </p>
      <p>a. We apply a potential difference (our power source) across a
        non linear resistance (our chosen liquid) </p>
      <p>b. This results in ionisation and electron flow that have
        different propagation rates. </p>
      <p>c. This current flow results in the formation of a magnetic
        field and if done correctly, (due to the Lorenz law), this field
        will rotate. </p>
      <p>d. The electron density is vastly different on the outer
        positive and the inner negative due to cylinder surface area. </p>
      <p>e. The creation of numerous and very small bubbles. I see the
        key element here more the bursting (abrupt shock) of the bubbles
        rather than the creation of same. This I see very closely
        parallelling the sonoluminescence experiments and the resultant
        manifestation of blue light that results from these experiments.
      </p>
      <p>f. The creation of compartments or layers of dissimilar
        physical characteristics. In our case stainless steel and water.
      </p>
      <p>One or more of the above can break the at rest (stable and
        balanced) condition of the Zero Point Energy (ZPE) force in the
        vicinity of the cell. The disturbance of the stable state of the
        ZPE will create a reaction and this reaction coming back via our
        non linear cell will provide more energy than what was required
        to instigate the action. </p>
      <p>Please note that this reaction can be a ‘push’ or a ‘shove’and
        the cell can both act as a source or a sink for different
        applications. Very important. </p>
      <p>It is interesting to note that similar over unity devices by
        Meyer and Puharich also use a method to shock (with voltage
        pulses) the ZPE, with the result of non linear exchange with
        matter. In both cases water (thus ion flow in part) was the
        medium </p>
      <p>As mentioned under (e) above, I very much favour the effect
        that results from the collapsing air bubbles. </p>
      <p>Claudia Eberlien (Cambridge University, 1996) talking on
        sonoluminescence stated that a bubble of the minimum radius can
        cause an increase in value of a thousandfold and we are only
        talking about one bubble. I would suggest that this excess
        energy is from the ZPE field. </p>
      <p><b><i>Rule 2:</i></b> </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, Eberlien, Mizuno and many other have shown
        anomalies with sonoluminescence experiments. These simply sated,
        were an excesses of heat far beyond any possible test equipment
        or laboratory measurement problems or anomalies. </p>
      <p>Eberlien believes that the light (the blue light of Orgone in
        my view) is being emitted by the vacuum surrounding the bubble.
      </p>
      <p>"Modern quantum theory holds that unseeable virtual photons (as
        mentioned above) abound in the vacuum. The behaviour of these
        zero point fluctuations is influenced by the properties of the
        surrounding medium". </p>
      <p>Cheretski (1983) is another scientist happy with the above
        concepts, namely, "...vacuum energy can explain this mysterious
        effect. ...Emerging from below the ZPE level from ‘nothing’ and
        returning to ‘nothing’, virtual particles appear to defy the
        laws of conservation of energy". </p>
      <p>As I have mentioned, if we remove the walls from this so-called
        ‘closed’ system of present day physics, we can readily introduce
        new laws to replace invalid old ones. </p>
      <p>Another non-linearity is the speed differential between the ion
        current and the electron current in relation to the cell. There
        is a large time difference in the propagation velocity of the
        two and this time difference can be manipulated with suitable
        pulsing, or partial of complete potential reversals. </p>
      <p>This effect can be utilised to cause the ZPE to be accumulated
        or added in our cells. </p>
      <p>I have stated many times the example of the child on the swing
        and the importance of the parent providing the ‘push’ or impetus
        at the exact right time. Only with this synchronicity will the
        cell move from the seeding to the breeding or stage 3 cycle. And
        just as importantly, to go to stage 4, the push has to at least
        equal all possible external ‘friction’s’ or dampening agents on
        the cell. </p>
      <p>Simplistically, I called the friction the leaking of the cell
        and our stage 4 cell can overcome these, but the stage 3 cannot
        overcome all possible interferences. </p>
      <p>For additional information on the ion/electron effect, you may
        want to read Tom Beardon’s paper dated "Bearden on Bedini’s
        negative resistance effect --- 04-09-2000" and posted on
        Keelynet. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Power Supply</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b><i>Preamble:</i></b> </p>
      <p>As you probably know, there are many speculations, myths,
        rumours, guesses and so on as to what constitutes the ‘right’
        power supply. My manual is interpreted incorrectly by some, so I
        want to again reinforce what I did say, and not what some
        individuals think that I meant by those statements. </p>
      <p>Let me again remind you that when Joe (and others) started
        their experiments with the intention of running cars on water,
        there were no fancy power supplies and the Joe Cell ‘effect’ was
        unknown. </p>
      <p>It was simply a matter of making as much gas as possible and to
        do this, lots of current and electrolyte were the answer. I am
        going back 10 years and you simply have to watch a video of
        these early attempts to confirm what I am saying. </p>
      <p>That is still the way to go if you want to generate gas.
        Commercial units are based on a lot of current, a lot of
        electrolyte, a lot of heat and a lot of pressure. It is not
        where we want to go! </p>
      <p>The early power supplies were car batteries and/or battery
        chargers. The function of these power supplies was to
        electrolyse water and thus generate hydrogen and oxygen. No
        attempts were made to separate the two gasses and thus we ended
        up with a variety of gas combinations. </p>
      <p>Depending on the quantity and type of electrolyte and also the
        current passed through the cells, we had the production of water
        vapour, steam, hydrogen, oxygen, Brown’s gas and even atomic
        hydrogen plus trace gasses that resulted from the various
        chemistry used as an electrolyte. </p>
      <p>It was much later that experimenters realised that it was not
        the known gasses that was required, but a mysterious gas or
        force that ran the car without the requirement of brute
        electrolysis of large quantities of water or even the gasses as
        we know them. </p>
      <p>In fact, it was discovered that a very small current would
        suffice and that the water was not even consumed, as we were not
        interested in electrolysis for the sake of creating Brown’s gas
        and thus running the car on hydrogen. </p>
      <p>With the discovery of the ‘force’, methods were employed to
        increase the cells ability to run in this mode, i.e., to be a
        generator, transformer or accumulator of this energy. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately as this force is not very well understood, cannot
        be readily seen or measured, the end result was total confusion.
      </p>
      <p>It is only at this stage that the dimensions, power supply,
        materials and water became important. As you all know plain old
        every day electrolysis follows very well known rules and you
        only have to go to your nearest electro-plating concern to see
        the methods in use. </p>
      <p>Two piece of metal in a plastic bucket, some electrolyte,
        connect a car battery to the metal plates, and hey presto,
        electrolysis! </p>
      <p>The Joe cell is not an electro-plating device, in actuality we
        go to great effort to prevent the migration of metallic ions. As
        we are not interested in electro-plating, or the creation of
        hydrogen and oxygen, we go to great effort to optimise the cell
        for its chosen task. </p>
      <p>People that think that you can simply connect the above said
        bucket to a car and then get free energy forever and ever,
        should really have their heads examined. Think about it for
        heavens sake! It is that easy, how come no one is doing it?
        Sheesh! </p>
      <p>It is an art form, a skill, a special technique that belies the
        difficulties in the apparent simplicity. </p>
      <p>For example, take a grain of wheat put it in light on a piece
        of wet cotton wool and Bingo!, we have a plant. Easy hey? Yeah
        sure! Do you realise the complexity of this simply result? The
        cell is the same. </p>
      <p><b><i>Options:</i></b> </p>
      <p>There is a vast variety of possible power supplies, and some
        have been mentioned by readers and experimenters. Unfortunately,
        included in the suggestions is some very misleading guidance,
        deliberate or otherwise. </p>
      <p>As I am not perfect and as I also do not know all the answers,
        all I can do is to offer you advice and methods that I have
        found that work for me. That is all that I would hope for from
        others. </p>
      <p>This advice comes from years of hands on work, and is not
        merely theories that may flash through my brain whilst watching
        my favourite sporting event. </p>
      <p>1. We must have some form of direct current, be it pulsations
        or an offset on the AC. It is IMPOSSIBLE to have electrolysis
        with a pure sine wave that comes from your power point! It make
        no difference if you are in the Northern of Southern hemisphere
        or how you hold your mouth to whatever. It is no go! </p>
      <p>As a sine wave, be it 50 hZ or 60 hZ is equal and opposite for
        the same time in one 360 degree period, the current will try to
        flow one way for half to the time and the other way for the
        remainder. Equal and opposite and thus no electrolysis. I simply
        cannot understand why people insist that this will work, they
        simply could not have tried it. </p>
      <p>Trust me guys, the people that recommend pure AC (no matter
        what the frequency) are wrong. If you only use a mains
        transformer, the output voltage, current or operating frequency
        abilities are irrelevant, you have pure AC and it will not cause
        electrolysis! </p>
      <p>2. HOWEVER, if we have a resultant offset current, either
        positive or negative, this will result in periods of direct
        current that remains passing through the cell in one direction,
        and we thus have electrolysis. We must have some sort of
        unbalance. </p>
      <p>This is simply achieved by rectifying the AC with a diode
        combination and not utilising the filtering capacitor to smooth
        out the ripple. The end result is a direct current with a very
        large ripple component, and if you look in any cheap battery
        charger, this is all the it contains, a transformer, diode and
        some protection circuitry and maybe an Ammeter. </p>
      <p>3. The simple battery charger above, worked very well for many
        experimenters including Joe for many, many years. There must be
        hundreds of stage 3 cells that never saw anything better as a
        power source. Sadly when the cell will not go to stage 3, people
        tend to clutch at straws, to listen to the flavour of the month.
        This months flavour is the ‘ special ’ power supply. </p>
      <p>4. Like all things, over the years the cell was refined and the
        power supply as well. As you know, we now have stage 4 and stage
        5 working and who knows what next. </p>
      <p>These later systems employ specialised power supplies. Before I
        tell you what I know on this, let me very briefly define the two
        basic cell utilisations. </p>
      <p><b>A.</b> The cell is designed for car work and as such it will
        be running from 12 Volts. I will remind you here that the reason
        I chose 12 Volts at 1 Amp as a standard are two fold. </p>
      <p>One was, that the Ammeter on the dash in Joe’s car whilst
        running on the cell indicated 1.25 Amps. </p>
      <p>The second was my hope that if everybody used the same standard
        (12 Volts, 1 Amp), we could swap experimental data and thus
        achieve our aims sooner. This second aim was a complete flop as
        in general, people simply do not want to share. </p>
      <p>As the cell has to run on 12 volts, I found that some water
        simply had insufficient conductivity, (too much internal
        resistance) and would not pass sufficient current for the
        desired effect. Thus I (among many others) started experimenting
        with electrolytes. This is not a desired feature but a case of
        necessity. Obviously, if you can get enough electrolysis with 12
        Volts, you do not have to add anything to the water. </p>
      <p>But, dear reader, I would just about guarantee you that in the
        above case, the water was so full of natural or man made
        electrolytes that the addition was already done for you. </p>
      <p>And that goes for dear Joe and him not using electrolyte with
        12 Volts. </p>
      <p><b>B.</b> The cell is designed for other non 12 Volt related
        applications. In this case you definitely do not want to use
        electrolyte, as you can tailor your power supply to deliver the
        exact current required. </p>
      <p>Joe is using this method to start the cells of visitors and
        also to go to stage 4. His supply has the ability of supplying
        far more than 12 volts and thus no electrolyte is required. In
        this case it can be said that Joe does not use electrolyte and
        this is correct, as now the statement is not taken out of
        context. </p>
      <p><b><i>The supply:</i></b> </p>
      <p>In Joes words and loosely translated, "...I have made a power
        supply that seems to adjust itself to the frequency that is
        required by any cell..". </p>
      <p>The above is all well and good, but I am sure that like myself
        you would love to know how to do the above, whatever it means. </p>
      <p>As you have read down his far, you will have realised that I am
        stating that the shock or impulse that allows our cells to work
        must be of sufficient magnitude and must have the right
        periodicity for us to initially ‘seed’ the cell and then to keep
        repeating this push or shock at the right frequency to allow the
        ‘breeding’ process to continue. Additionally, the shock or pulse
        has to be of sufficient magnitude to overcome the cells natural
        tendencies to ‘ leak ’. </p>
      <p>Now the above is a big ask, and various experimenters on many
        systems have been trying to do this for years. Joe for one, by
        utilising a simple and cheap second hand ex-Telecom power supply
        can do this and this can be duplicated by others. After knowing
        the tricks that is. </p>
      <p>Joe doe not use any additional components (to the best of my
        knowledge) he simply rewires the circuitry around the primary
        and secondary of the transformer. This power supply modification
        allows the cell to work in stage 4 mode. </p>
      <p>Let me state at this point that any modification of power
        supplies or mains connected appliances is DANGEROUS because it
        can be LETHAL!!!!!! </p>
      <p>There is not many more dangerous combinations than water and
        electricity. I am not advising anybody to modify anything or to
        tamper or change any mains connected appliance! Far from it. </p>
      <p>I am simply repeating what others have done with the aim of
        passing on experimental knowledge to people versed in the
        required arts. Moving on. </p>
      <p>Joe is convinced that we are using electricity incorrectly and
        that we are only using the ‘positive’. In his view the
        modification to the power supply are made to utilise the unused
        ‘ negative ’. </p>
      <p>In closing, a normal power supply will get you up to stage 3,
        and if you cannot get this far there is no point in endangering
        yourself and other by making possibly lethal modifications. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Update 6</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">The Joe Cell and the ‘ Y ’ factor.</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b><i>Definition:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The ‘Y’ factor is the ability of the operator (or any radiating
        body in the near vicinity), to interact with the device and
        cause either an enhancement or diminishment in its desired
        performance. </p>
      <p>I have named it the ‘Y’ factor for ‘you’ after Reich suggested
        that his Orgone motor required a ‘Y’ factor for its correct
        operation. As Reich’s documents are still locked away and thus
        unseen, I cannot guarantee that definition from Reich’s point of
        view. It remains to be seen if we have the same definition for
        ‘Y’. </p>
      <p><b><i>General:</i></b> </p>
      <p>What the experimenter really should know is, what proof is
        there in science that an organic structure can interact with a
        non organic structure. Or put in simpler terms, can the presence
        of a person affect the outcome of an experiment and vice versa?
      </p>
      <p>For the well read amongst you, there is a resounding yes to the
        above question as it has been proven thousands of times in
        metaphysical type experiments such as spoon bending, mediumship,
        alternative healing and the feats of certain religious groups. </p>
      <p>However for the sceptical, once bitten twice shy individual,
        the above are merely non scientific sleight of hand, fraud,
        trickery, coincidences, chance events or freak occurrences and
        can be easily debunked by such great ‘Gurus’ as the ‘great ’
        Randi (the debunkers' God). </p>
      <p>It would be nice to have solid proof from the scientific
        fraternity, to at least show your doubting friends and/or to
        give even you dear reader a bit more faith in the phenomenon. </p>
      <p><b><i>Quantum Physics:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Basically the theory that energy does not have continuous range
        of values, but instead it has a discontinuity and this energy is
        composed of finite units called quanta. </p>
      <p>By this science agrees in the main to the theory, that our
        world is not a continuous construction nor is it solid. On the
        contrary our world actually ‘exists’ as short and rapid bursts
        of light or quanta. </p>
      <p>From the above it can be easily deducted that as the world is
        not solid or as it does not have a continuous existence, then we
        can have ‘magical’ events where objects can appear or disappear
        and where time can be gained or lost. </p>
      <p>In actuality, an outcome called the ‘Bose-Einstein condensate’
        allows for two atoms to occupy the same point. These events have
        been observed and even seen with the naked eye as well as being
        photographed. (Satinover 1997) </p>
      <p>As the above in practice would allow for the concept of
        parallel universes, we can see the far reaching implication of
        our Joe cell and the source of the cell’s power. </p>
      <p>In passing: Hugh Everett from Princetown University covered the
        above topic in 1957. </p>
      <p>I introduced Quantum physics to show you that the ‘Y’ factor
        can be acting on several dimensions and in years to come will
        have a very logical explanation for the effect. Similarly, it
        shows that what we call reality is not as ‘ firm’ or solid as we
        believed it was. </p>
      <p>This was known thousands of years ago with the ‘Maya’ concept,
        stating that we live in an illusion that we call reality, and
        our scientists have merely rediscovered a very old and well
        trodden path. </p>
      <p><b><i>Matter:</i></b> </p>
      <p>As quantum physics start to shatter the illusion of what we
        call reality, it comes down to the question of what in actuality
        is ‘matter’?. For if there is no continuity or ‘solidity’,
        including the Joe Cell or us, where does it leave the
        established laws? </p>
      <p>Let me quote you the great Max Planck, a Nobel prize winner: </p>
      <p>"There is no matter as such! All matter originates and exists
        only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom
        to vibration and holds this most minute solar system
        together....We must assume behind this force the existence of a
        conscious and intelligent mind. This mind is the Matrix of all
        matter". </p>
      <p>There dear reader you have the crux of the situation. If there
        is no matter as such, and if matter is held together by the
        conscious mind, then we as part of the same construct (
        conscious mind ) interact with all and everything. </p>
      <p>As I would rather stick to science (imperfect as it may be)
        then wade into the depths of religion (a no-win situation in any
        debate), I will leave it at that for you to ponder on if you so
        wish. </p>
      <p>Let me show you only a few examples of the type of interaction
        on the scientific level that may suffice. It follows that the
        action can be from a device to a human as well as from a human
        to a device. </p>
      <p><b><i>Examples:</i></b> </p>
      <p>A. V. Chernetski, Moscow 1983, from the book ‘<i>Systems of
          Plasma with Separation of Charges</i>’, page 91: Figure 10
        shows the reaction of the human body to the operation of devices
        utilising the Zero Point Energy ( ZPE ). In this example there
        is scientific proof of a device affecting the operator in very
        specific ways. </p>
      <p>Viktor S. Grebennikov, Senior researcher, Russian Academy of
        Science. From the book ‘ <i>My World</i> ’. Like the first
        example, Viktor talks about many side effect whilst on his ‘
        anti-gravity ’ platform and whilst near certain shape forms. </p>
      <p>Included in the above are some simple experiments that you can
        do at very low cost, and thus prove this factor for yourself. </p>
      <p>Glen Rein &amp; Rollin McCraty, Third annual conference of the
        International Society for the Study of Subtle Energies, 1993: It
        has been shown that emotion can actually change the physical
        molecule of DNA. " individuals trained in generating focused
        feeling of deep love...were able to intentionally cause a change
        in the shape of the DNA ". </p>
      <p>The above shows that a controlled though can alter something.
        By logic it would follow, that the state of a person is also
        some form of ‘ at rest ’ energy field and this field will also
        interact with other fields. </p>
      <p>Richard Broughton, Director of Research at the Institute for
        Parapsychology in North Carolina: In his analysis of
        contemporary psychokinesis research, he proves conclusively and
        beyond any doubt that people can interact with inert objects and
        get these objects to perform as directed by the scientists. </p>
      <p>Again, it is only a small step to make in me saying that the
        observer that you invited to watch your Joe cell at work, will
        have a unique ‘ output ’ that he may not be aware of. </p>
      <p>I am simply saying that a mindset can disturb your experiment
        by reacting with the cell in a positive or negative way. </p>
      <p><i>Experiments in Distance Influence</i>. L. L. Vasoliev,
        Professor of Physiology as the University of Lenningrad. A good
        read with many examples of recorded scientific experiments of
        deliberate manipulations of various devices. This book also
        supplies some characteristic of the ‘ enemations’. </p>
      <p><i>Beyond Telepathy</i>. Andrija Puharich, Neurologist. Another
        very comprehensive ‘scientific’ proof of the ability of humans
        to interact with so called passive devices. </p>
      <p><b><i>In a nutshell:</i></b> </p>
      <p>I can quote you books upon books of documented mind over matter
        scientifically observed and carried out experiments, but it is
        not my job to convince you of anything. I simply bring it to
        your attention, to use or abuse, believe it or not. </p>
      <p>Your conclusive proof is as close as your nearest library and
        the effort that you are prepared to make to attain knowledge. </p>
      <p>Some points that may be worth considering: </p>
      <p>1. Mankind simply does not ‘know’ anything. We only have
        theories and these theories are constantly being upgraded as new
        experiments refine our knowledge. As such there is no theory or
        law that is set in concrete. We simply do not understand all the
        possible variables to be able to formulate definite and thus
        unchangeable laws. </p>
      <p>2. As we only have theories, for someone to say that it is
        impossible for the external environment to affect a Joe cell is
        pure nonsense. Of course if they were prepared to prove it,
        hey!, we have a new ball game. </p>
      <p>3. As we are part of the environment and are ‘broadcasting’ a
        whole range of frequencies, it is not too outlandish to suggest
        that these frequencies may interact with the frequencies of the
        materials and their operation, that makes up the Joe cell
        device. </p>
      <p>4. If point (3.) above is plausible, it follows by logic, that
        this interaction may be additive or subtractive in such a way as
        to make the cell function ‘better’ or ‘worse’. </p>
      <p>5. The end result is, that the human as well as the natural and
        man made complex frequency bands ( and harmonics resultant ) is
        a very important consideration in the research on subtle energy
        devices. </p>
      <p><b><i>Summary:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Science has proven that there is no such thing as a firm/solid
        reality. Science has also proven that there is a two way
        interaction between all things (on this planet at least). That
        is a fact! That is also the ‘Y’ factor. </p>
      <p>I would strongly suggest to the serious experiment to be aware
        of the ‘Y’ factor and not treat it as some sort of fairy tale. </p>
      <p>Simply because the majority of ‘sheeple’ on this planet are
        only aware of what is purported to be ‘fact’ via media releases
        and similar, it is very easy to throw away the baby with the
        bath water. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Stainless Steel and the Joe Cell.</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b><i>Introduction:</i></b> </p>
      <p>I am including more information on the stainless cylinders and
        their preparation and treatment. </p>
      <p>My aim is twofold, firstly to clear up some of the
        misconceptions that seem to have entered the arena. </p>
      <p>Secondly to add new material that may further help the
        experimenter. </p>
      <p><b><i>Stainless Steel:</i></b> </p>
      <p>There is nothing magic about stainless steel, or the reason
        that we use it in the cell. </p>
      <p>We use it because it is reasonably inert to the electrolysing
        process and far cheaper than titanium, gold or platinum, the
        last mentioned being the perfect choice but simply too costly
        even for Universities (in the quantity required). </p>
      <p>So as we are making a cost compromise, we must be prepared for
        problems that result from not using the optimum material. And
        the stainless does have many problems. </p>
      <p><b><i>Types:</i></b> </p>
      <p>There are many types of stainless steel and they fall under
        three broad categories: </p>
      <p>1. Austenitic. These contain chromium and nickel as the main
        percentage of the alloy. Type 302, 304 and 316 are typical
        examples. </p>
      <p>2. Ferritic. These contain mainly chromium and ferrite. Type
        430 is a typical example. </p>
      <p>3. Martensitic. These are low carbon steels containing mainly
        iron and chromium. Type 410 is a typical example. </p>
      <p>As we are only interested in ‘non magnetic’stainless steel, we
        are interested in the austenitic or type 3xx variety and more
        specifically type 304, 316 or 316L. </p>
      <p>Of the three mentioned types, 316L has superior corrosion
        resistance to chemicals and is the most common type used by Joe
        cell experimenters. </p>
      <p>As said previously, I use it as well, but I am quite partial to
        the cheaper 304 (food grade) </p>
      <p><b><i>Quality:</i></b> </p>
      <p>I could write volumes here, but basically you get what you pay
        for. </p>
      <p>If the steel is not wrapped in a plastic sleeve, does not have
        regular type identification numbers on it, shows a longitudinal
        discoloured weld seam, is thicker at the weld seam and is out of
        round, do I really have to tell you that you have got an
        inferior (and thus cheaper) length and that you should not even
        bother taking it out of the rack? </p>
      <p>Now the above are ‘first impression’ things that you can do
        with your hands still in your pocket. </p>
      <p>If your steel does not have any of the above traits, it is time
        for the trusty rare earth magnet. I have described the test
        procedure before, so I will not elaborate. </p>
      <p>For the lucky (read, with money), seamless steel that is
        extruded is the way to go and you increase your chances of
        success by quite a large margin. </p>
      <p>If you were wondering, no, I cannot afford it and I use what I
        can get. </p>
      <p>Okay you say, my steel looks great, tests great, do I have a
        piece for the construction of the perfect cell? </p>
      <p>Sadly no, for there are yet many hurdles to jump. Read on. </p>
      <p>I have mentioned over and over that the Joe cell is the most
        deceptive device of all, it looks so simple to make, it has so
        few parts and yet less than a dozen ( known experimenters ) can
        make it fly. </p>
      <p>I would love a dollar for all the hours of frustration that
        experimenters around the world have poured into the cell, I
        would have to be a multi-millionaire and quite a few thousand of
        that would have to be my contribution. If only the people who
        ‘knew’would share, now what a wonderful world that would be. </p>
      <p><b><i>The ‘ right ’ Stainless Steel:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Additional to the above type and quality of the stainless, we
        enter into the world of pseudo science or at least science that
        is not taught in Universities and such like. </p>
      <p>Let me give you a few examples: </p>
      <p>1. A person that could not get his cell going took it to Joe.
        Joe simply moved the position of the positive connection to the
        cell on outer case and it commenced working. </p>
      <p>2. Another person took a non working cell to Joe. Joe told this
        individual that the two inner cylinders were "upside down". </p>
      <p>3. Another non working cell was taken to Joe. Joe drilled the
        minutest hole in a critical area and the cell sprung to life. </p>
      <p>4. A person was walking down Joe’s drive-way with his $6,000
        dollar purchase of the ‘right’ steel. Before he got to Joe, Joe
        told him it was ‘crap’ and to take it back. </p>
      <p>5. To get the ‘right’ steel keg, Joe chose out of 200 beer kegs
        and even now only has one keg that will start up in exactly the
        same mode each time. </p>
      <p>6. When your cell does not work, Joe recommends the ‘flashing’
        of the cylinders to set up the right </p>
      <p><b><i>‘Field’:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The above examples are some that come quickly to mind, there
        are many others. </p>
      <p>So dear reader, you have read the above, what do you make of
        it? </p>
      <p>I will tell you what I make of it and it is all bad news for a
        ‘quick and easy’ project. </p>
      <p>a. There are obviously complex atomic and sub-atomic
        characteristics that are involved. </p>
      <p>Additionally there are magnetic, electric and aetheric
        interactions at a very subtle level. </p>
      <p>b. There is some form of tuning involved that is not measurable
        with conventional scientific methods. </p>
      <p>c. Some people can ‘see’ and thus make or correct components by
        ‘intuition’ or ‘gut feeling’. </p>
      <p>Summing up a. b. and c., I read that scientific methods alone
        will not make a cell work nor be able to explain the operation.
        But then you knew that. </p>
      <p>Back to the stainless, what can you do to at least enhance your
        cell’s ability to ‘do’ something? </p>
      <p><b><i>Suggestions:</i></b> </p>
      <p>1. It goes without saying that you should get what has worked
        for others. Definitely 304, 316 and 316L has and is working for
        experimenters. </p>
      <p>2. Make sure that your chosen cell passes the tests as
        mentioned previously and above. </p>
      <p>3. If you cut the steel, use a low temperature process and a
        cutting method that does not inbed foreign material in the cut.
        Read my previous notes on the subject. </p>
      <p>4. Make sure that the length of your inner tubes are close to
        the same length with parallel cuts top and bottom. Very easy to
        test at the machine shop before you pay your good money, simply
        place on a flat surface and hold a metal ruler on edge across
        the top. This little test tells all. </p>
      <p>If your cylinder set has just come of the lathe, there are no
        excuses for sloppy work. If you have made a set at home, please
        realise that the length has to be reasonably the same, in
        actuality only the top surface of the cylinder pack had to be
        dead level, the odd length can ‘hang’ out the bottom. </p>
      <p>A little trick, if the one inch tube is higher than the rest,
        it can ‘see’ over the top of the others and your cell is dead!
        Far better to lower the central tube a smidgin and thus it will
        be ‘blind’. </p>
      <p>The above is easily observed by filling the cell to meniscus
        level and observing the bubble pattern. </p>
      <p>5. If you have to polish the tubes, be very careful! The
        polishing lines must not run at an angle to the circumference of
        the tube. I have mentioned this before as it is hard to do
        inside the two inch. </p>
      <p>What I have not explained is exactly how to ‘clean’ the
        stainless tubes before using. </p>
      <p>This now follows: </p>
      <p><b><i>Passivation:</i></b> </p>
      <p>This is a generic term used to describe the process of removing
        free iron from the surface of the stainless. If not done, the
        surface may exhibit the ‘rust spots’ that most builders complain
        about. </p>
      <p>The process should remove the surface contamination without
        significantly affecting the stainless steel itself. </p>
      <p>It is the addition of the chromium that makes the steel rust
        resistant by combining with the oxygen to form a very thin and
        invisible layer of chromium oxide. </p>
      <p>This is called the passive film. </p>
      <p>So, as you busily polish your works of art, you are also
        removing this thin chromium film and exposing the iron to the
        air and thus you have rust, the brown spots that we are all
        familiar with. </p>
      <p>No, don’t slash your wrists, the cure is very simple. </p>
      <p><b><i>Methods of Passivation:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The commercial method involves the submerging of the steel in a
        solution of nitric acid ( 20-25% by volume ) and sodium
        bicarbonate ( 2-3% by weight ) and 35% of water. </p>
      <p>The steel is submerged for 20 to 30 minutes and the nitric acid
        dissolves the iron and restores the original corrosion resistant
        surface. </p>
      <p>Dear reader, nitric acid is not very friendly, expensive and
        not easy to dispose of. Leave this method to the professionals.
      </p>
      <p>For home use I would suggest citric acid that is easy to get
        and is safe and easy to use. A 4-10% by weight solution in water
        works just fine to passivate, clean and brighten just about any
        stainless steel. </p>
      <p>The time is about the same as for nitric acid and as you should
        not be in a hurry, 30 minutes is fine. </p>
      <p>Rinse in NON tap water ( your favourite mix ) and they are
        ready for assembly. </p>
      <p><b><i>Electropolishing:</i></b> </p>
      <p>As you are by now the proud owner of a power supply, various
        containers and other equipment as used by those ‘ familiar with
        the art &lt;g&gt; ’, you may be interested to try and do your
        own electropolishing. </p>
      <p>By using oxalic acid (your wife may have some for dying cloth)
        or by using phosphoric acid (if you have made Go-Juice) as an
        electrolyte, and a bar of copper as your cathode (negative) you
        are ready to go. </p>
      <p>Your stainless steel has a positive lead clipped to it and the
        copper bar or rod is your negative. Put them in a plastic bucket
        or similar and adjust the concentration of the electrolyte until
        you get decent action with your power supply of battery. </p>
      <p>Bingo! All the cruddy heat tint and similar are gone forever. </p>
      <p><b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Even after purchasing you super expensive bit of seamless
        stainless, lovingly prepared by the vestigial virgins in the
        Black Forrest, it still may not work. </p>
      <p>This is due to the molecular alignments within the metal and
        the interaction with the subtle fields in the near vicinity of
        the cell. </p>
      <p>I would suggest that you do all the previously mentioned
        operations and then ‘flash’ each tube before assembling the
        cell. If a certain tube does not produce bubbles from both
        surfaces or does not seem to take part in the action, try
        turning it end for and/or rotating a ¼ of a turn at a time. </p>
      <p>When you have your tubes perfectly aligned mark this position
        with some form of indelible mark. A tiny pin punch mark on the
        bottom cut edge is fine. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Update No. 8.</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Aim</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The purpose of this update is to compile all the known factual
        and proven data on the cell in relation to car operation only. </p>
      <p>This data is not simply based on "Joe said, Alex said, etc.".
        It is based on conclusive empirical tests that have been
        replicated by at least two or more cell experimenters. </p>
      <p>There is an immense amount of speculation, disinformation,
        wishful thinking and wild theories that are circulating the
        Internet. </p>
      <p>Just like UFO sightings the above achieves derision for any
        factual sighting or successful cell experimenters from the so
        called scientific peers. Thus the experimenters are divided,
        shamed and mocked into clandestine research and minimal reports.
      </p>
      <p>And so the aims of the controlling minority are achieved yet
        again. </p>
      <p>I have done my best to present the facts from my daily cell
        research and contacts with successful researchers. This is given
        to you freely in the spirit of sharing and brotherhood. </p>
      <p>Needless to say you have to treat this update with equal
        suspicion as any other set of radical claims. That I would
        expect from any logical, scientific and open mind. I am always
        receptive to positive criticism. </p>
      <p><b><i>Introduction:</i></b> </p>
      <p>I see that the majority of individuals have a desire to ‘run’ a
        car on a cell. Although there is a multiplicity of far more
        noble uses for this accumulator or converter, I will provide the
        information slanted towards that desire. </p>
      <p>As we should all know by now, the success of the above desire
        can be broadly broken up into 3 main stages. </p>
      <p>1. The cell. </p>
      <p>2. The transfer from the cell to car. </p>
      <p>3. The car modifications and conversion process. </p>
      <p>Thus the known facts on the above will be presented under these
        three headings and in no particular order of importance. </p>
      <p><b><i>The Cell:</i></b> </p>
      <p>* The power source for the cell can be a battery, batteries,
        power supply or similar. There is no need for the latest
        ‘special’ power supply to achieve stage three. I cannot stress
        this enough, as recently there has been deliberate
        misinformation stating that only a ‘special’ power supply will
        do. </p>
      <p>If you look at this matter historically, Joe stared his
        research in 1991 and in those early days he only used a 12 Volt
        car battery, and later on a Telecom 75 volt 50 Amp battery
        charger. These are the facts. </p>
      <p>Personally with my modest successes, I never had the luxury of
        this ‘special’ power supply. </p>
      <p>Of course I would like the schematic as how to make one, but
        the anal retentives will be what they are, retentive. </p>
      <p>You can be assured that the day I get it, the next day you will
        have it, and that is the reason that nobody is talking to me. </p>
      <p>There is no need for special filters, huge smoothing capacitor,
        complex wave shapes, special ‘secret’ frequencies, special Zener
        diode networks, impossible AC ‘charging’, ‘turning’ around the
        negative, or any similar gobble gook. </p>
      <p>Yes, for an advanced researcher Joe’s new power supply will
        start just about any cell and on just about any water, but it is
        not vital to have one to prove the basic concepts of running a
        car on a cell. </p>
      <p>* A properly working cell will keep all the cylinder surfaces
        clean. On the application of power both surfaces (except the
        outer positive and the inner negative) will have a gas
        production of very fine bubbles. This is aided by having all
        surfaces highly polished. </p>
      <p>Yes, inside the cylinders as well and not just the easy to do
        outsides. </p>
      <p>* No surface tension is a very good indication that your cell
        is not working properly or at all. </p>
      <p>* The personal ‘polarity’ of an individual Will definitely
        interact with the cell in the crucial seeding stages. This may
        help or deter or completely stop the seeding process. </p>
      <p>* An easy way to test if the cell is breeding is to light a
        bubble and observe the effect. That is the only use of the
        bubbles to us, for the car does not run on the bubbles. In
        actuality, charged water (without power applied) does not have
        visible gas production and it runs the car just fine. </p>
      <p>NOTE! Be extremely cautious lighting any crystal clear long
        staying bubbles (a day or so old). These little fellows contain
        an incredible amount of ‘energy’ that can cause severe damage
        over a large area on being ignited. Don’t say that I did not
        warn you! </p>
      <p>* There is no need for electrolyte in most instances. The need
        for electrolyte signifies a cell problem or very low voltage. By
        increasing the voltage applied to the cell you can make any cell
        start seeding (all other parameters being okay that is). </p>
      <p>In actuality the breeding cell will reject all impurities
        (including the electrolyte) from the water and this will be the
        commonly observed sediments that are seen in the cell in various
        locations. Once these impurities are removed, the water will
        remain crystal clear. </p>
      <p>Note. Some water will continue to release chemicals. I decided
        with one cell to see exactly how much and how long. After 3
        months the cell was completely filled with sediment (to the very
        top), there seems to be no end to it. </p>
      <p>Solution? Change the water type and try again. You may have to
        try dozens of water types before you find the ‘right’ one for
        you and your cell. </p>
      <p>The big advantage of using the vat is that the impurities stay
        in the keg and you remove the clean charged water and use it to
        fill the car cell </p>
      <p>So if you have used electrolyte and have not ‘cooked’ the cell,
        as the cell starts to seed and then breed it will self clean and
        reject these ‘impurities’ and still end up a working cell. </p>
      <p>All that I am pointing out is that with a higher voltage,
        electrolyte is not required. </p>
      <p><i>Please note:</i> Incompatible metal, excess charging time
        and excess currents will deposit the actual metals of the
        cylinders themselves. Simply stated, you have ‘cooked’ the cell,
        pull it apart, start again. </p>
      <p>* I must have said this hundreds of times, we are not
        interested in electrolysis or the generation of hydrogen and/or
        oxygen, thus we are not interested in large currents, and
        extended periods of ‘ charging ’ time. </p>
      <p>If there is no sign of the ‘right’ activity within one minute
        (at the longest), stop. Change something and try again. </p>
      <p>You may get the cell breeding first time or after months, or
        years. If it does not work, change something, there is no point
        in giving it more power or charging time. Sooner to later, you
        will strike the right ‘ frequency ’ ( as Joe calls it ), it is a
        matter of observation and persistence and the right mindset. </p>
      <p>If all fails, check you body polarity, you should be ‘ positive
        ’. If not, you can temporarily flip your body potential and ( if
        this was the problem ), the cell will now perform for you. </p>
      <p>I have written down the procedure in my manual (there is a free
        copy on the web). </p>
      <p>You may laugh, however this is an often proven ‘cure’. </p>
      <p>Read, experiment, share. The aim of these notes are to help you
        on the path to success. </p>
      <p>* The water level must be above the top of the cylinders for
        the cell to work properly. A working level of the water above
        the cylinders of 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch is fine for a start. </p>
      <p>* The insulators have to be seen as performing a variety of
        functions; </p>
      <p>A. An insulator of high resistance to conform to Ohm’s law. </p>
      <p>B. An insulator to prevent the ‘short circuit’ of the special
        field that do not conform to Ohm’s law. </p>
      <p>C. As a rigid support member to support the cylinder stack. </p>
      <p>D. As a precise spacer to retain the cylinders in accurate
        concentric orientation. </p>
      <p>* The only proven cell materials that work are 316 or 304 (food
        grade) stainless steel. </p>
      <p>Yes, I know that people have brass, copper, aluminium and even
        precious metal coated cells out there. In 8 years, I have not
        heard of one person that has a car running on an alternate metal
        cell, and by that I mean a car running on a cell alone and not a
        shandy of cell and petrol. </p>
      <p>If they have, they have not bothered to share it with the rest
        of us. and in that case there are more than useless to us,
        themselves and society as a whole. </p>
      <p>It is very important that the stainless is seamless or at least
        not to have a residual magnetic field discontinuity on the weld,
        or anywhere else for that matter. </p>
      <p>During the early and very delicate seeding stages, the cell
        relies on creating its own spiral magnetic field. Any residual
        magnetism will fight the establishment of this field by the
        cell. That is the reason that the initial material must be non
        magnetic to a reasonable degree. </p>
      <p>A very simple indicator that you have a ‘ magnetized ’ seam is
        that the cell will develop a fine black vertical line at the
        problem area. Additionally, if there is a bad field
        discontinuity, it will also create a fine vertical black line on
        the opposite side to the trouble area. If you have a faulty
        cell, dismantle it, let the cylinders dry naturally (do not wipe
        the water off) and have a careful look. </p>
      <p>If you have these vertical black lines, that cylinder is no
        good, get it heat treated or throw it away. </p>
      <p>Once the cell establishes seeding and then breeding, it can
        cope with external magnetic fields to some extent, as it now has
        set up it’s own permanent field patterns. </p>
      <p>Like all devices of this type, the starting of them is the
        hardest and most critical part of the whole procedure. </p>
      <p>* The charge remains in the water and the transfer of this
        water to another non-working cell, (or the car cell) will start
        up this new cell. This is on the proviso that the new cell is a
        suitable candidate. </p>
      <p><b><i>The Transfer from the Cell to the Car:</i></b> </p>
      <p>* For the zillionth time, WE DO NOT run the motor on hydrogen
        or oxygen, or their injection into the intake side of the motor.
        I am always amazed as to how many ‘experts’ analyze the cell
        operation as if it was some sort of hydrogen gas generator. It
        is not! </p>
      <p>WE DO NOT have any direct opening from the cell to the vacuum
        side of any part of the motor. We use a blanking plug on to the
        side of the motor or on the intake manifold, carburetor or
        similar. </p>
      <p>Sometime (rarely) a very small hole is drilled in the blanking
        plug if it is connected to a component that may have vacuum on
        the other side. </p>
      <p>Rarely! </p>
      <p>* A breeding cell does not require power to be applied to it
        after a successful car installation. </p>
      <p>Periodically, power does have to be applied to a leaking cell
        and/or during the conversion of the car and its contents (and
        occupants). </p>
      <p>In fact, once the car is totally ‘converted’, the cell can be
        removed completely. </p>
      <p>* If the cell is not ‘stable’, and if power is applied to it in
        the car, the cell may start in a different ‘mode’ each time the
        ignition (power to the cell) is turned on. Needless to say, the
        reliability factor would drive a person insane. </p>
      <p>Power to the cell does provide more power in some situations,
        but you have to be aware of the above shortcomings. If (and that
        is a big if), you had a stable cell, this cell would start up in
        the same mode each time and the above problem would not exist. </p>
      <p>It is wiser to fill the car cell with charged water on a as
        need basis and not to connect the cell to power in the car. If
        however the geometry, or location and such like of the cell is
        unsuitable, the charged water will be ‘discharged’ in a
        relatively short period to time. You will have to play the game
        by ear, yes, it is called experimentation. </p>
      <p>Sooner or later, you will find that the water remains charged,
        the car remains charged and that the car is reliable in any
        location over long periods of time. As this goal has different
        solution for different combinations of car and occupant/s, there
        are no clear cut rules that apply to all situations. </p>
      <p>* It must be realized that when the car is running on the cell,
        the butterfly of the carburetor become an air quantity control
        and so it is the ‘mixture’ control for the 'air/force’ mixture.
      </p>
      <p>Normally (on petrol) the mixture is a function of jetting and
        the butterfly is ‘how much’ of the optimized mix you allow the
        motor to intake. </p>
      <p>The above is one of the reasons of not having the cell
        operating on idle, as the air flow may be insufficient to
        provide the right mixture. </p>
      <p>This is very important! It explains why the car may ‘take off ’
        as you remove your foot from the accelerator and then stumble
        when you put your foot down. </p>
      <p>You will have to rethink the role of the accelerator to
        overcome any problems in this area. </p>
      <p>The above is also the reason that the Rover (using a Zenith, a
        form of S.U. carburetor) works so well as we have a constant
        displacement system. The needle and so the fuel quantity is
        controlled by the lifting of a tapered needle under vacuum
        control. </p>
      <p>Conversely, in a normal carburetor the mixture comes from a
        variety of jets that provide differing quantities of fuel under
        vacuum control. Sounds the same but it is not. </p>
      <p>The car modifications and conversion process. </p>
      <p>* Joe’s first car and easy conversion was a Rover 3500 SDI.
        This motor is a ‘natural’ for cell conversions. </p>
      <p>If you have a stationary installation (a test stand motor),
        re-read the above note on the function of the butterfly. </p>
      <p>* The converted car will display some very bizarre effects; </p>
      <p>A. Radiator can totally ice up. </p>
      <p>B. Cold white mist comes out of exhaust and sometimes the
        exhaust will have ice on it. </p>
      <p>C. Virtually silent running of motor and exhaust. </p>
      <p>D. Unreasonably and normally impossible engine RPM, either
        abnormally high (over 10,000 RPM) or low (1 RPM). Believe it or
        not. </p>
      <p>E. Various problems with the oil that is in the engine, i.e.,
        it may try to escape in any way possible. </p>
      <p>F. Weight loss of vehicle (partial or complete). </p>
      <p>G. Various electrical failures of car instrumentation. </p>
      <p>H. The motor may only idle and not rev out, or it will only run
        under load and not idle. </p>
      <p>I. And of course, no fuel required to run the motor. </p>
      <p>* Large timing changes are required to optimize the motor on
        the cell. For example the Rover required 80 degrees advance
        (distributor degrees). On non aluminium motors, you will do
        these advance changes on a progressive basis as you reduce the
        fuel quantity. </p>
      <p>* On non aluminium motors the conversion to cell has to be done
        following a set procedure. Basically a charged cell has to be in
        the car first to partially ‘charge’ the motor, and then slowly
        the fuel intake to the motor is reduced by either jet blockage
        or reduction or similar and then eventually the fuel is
        completely disconnected. At each step the appropriate advance
        adjustment are carried out. </p>
      <p>This process may take days or even weeks. </p>
      <p>So, with non aluminium type motors you cannot simply turn off
        the fuel source and then expect the cell to ‘kick in’ and run
        the car. </p>
      <p>When I was working on cars, I installed a cell first and drove
        around for several weeks to acclimatize the car. Only after that
        did I try any conversions. During this acclimatization period
        the cell will tell you when it is ready. </p>
      <p>It is not a simple conversion as on the Rover, where the fuel
        can be disconnected and the cell takes over and the motor is
        then optimized by ignition advance adjustments. </p>
      <p>* The location of the cell is reasonably critical. Any
        locations adjacent to strong magnetic (and thus interfering
        field) must be avoided. This would include starter motor
        cabling, ignition wiring, ignition coil, distributor, spark plug
        wiring, electric fuel pump and wiring, windscreen wiper motor
        and wiring, electric fan and wiring, air conditioner clutch and
        wiring, alternator and wiring and similar devices that require
        or produce electromagnetic field. </p>
      <p>* As mentioned in the cell section, a person can have an
        ‘negative’ polarity, and an onlooker or passenger is able to
        stop the cell from functioning. Fact. </p>
      <p><b><i>Conclusion:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The above is some of the known cell/car data that I have and
        that I have either personally witnessed or have received from
        more than one trusted and reliable source. </p>
      <p>If you can add facts to this list that will assist your fellow
        experimenters, what is holding you back? </p>
      <p>If you want to give your favourite arm chair theoretical
        discourse, please don’t bother, I personally am not interested,
        there is enough confusion already. </p>
      <p>If you disagree with any of the above and can prove otherwise,
        please do so, for that is the reason for having the Joe cell
        discussion group. </p>
      <p>I (and my sources) are far from infallible. </p>
      <p>In the spirit of sharing and research I wish you all success. </p>

              Destroys Plans</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>After announcing that he had successfully built a truck that
        runs on Joe Cell technology, drawing energy from water and
        Orgone, Bill Williams said he was approached by two men who
        demanded that he stop his research, threatening him with dire
        consequences if he didn't.&nbsp; Others are keeping it alive. </p>

          <b>Pure Energy Systems News</b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Joe Cell</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>USA -- A couple of weeks ago, Bill Williams told a discussion
        list that he successfully ran his truck on a device known as the
        Joe Cell.&nbsp; The power was far greater than the regular
        combustion engine -- and the energy was free. </p>
      <p>The Joe Cell is said to draw on Orgone energy.&nbsp; The fairly
        simple device uses electrically charged water as the "gate" or
        medium through which the aetheric energy is drawn from the
        surroundings and transferred to the automobile engine. </p>
      <p>Bill had posted images and rough descriptions, and was in
        process of disclosing in greater detail how he accomplished
        this, when he was confronted last week by two unidentified
        individuals who told him to cease all of his alternative energy
        work or there would be dire consequences. </p>
      <p>On April 11, Bill gave the following account of what happened
        just a few days after announcing his success. </p>
      <p>"I was on my way home Thursday last week [April 6, 2006] and
        was about 3 miles from the ferry project. I stopped to check the
        post connection point on the Cell. I was standing in front of my
        truck, and this late model 2005 or 2006 Ford Explorer pulled up
        and park diagonally in front of my truck. </p>
      <p>"The driver got out of the rig and walked around in front of
        their rig and approached me. At about the same time, the
        passenger opened his door. </p>
      <p>"The driver stated that they wanted me to stop working on all
        forms of alternative energy. He also stated that we know
        everything about me, my family, and all my projects past and
        present. </p>
      <p>"At about that time the passenger reached and held up a file
        that was about 2 or so inches thick. He opened it up and showed
        me telephone transcripts, emails, messages from the groups that
        I had belonged to. </p>
      <p>"They knew where my kids worked, the times they are at work;
        also my wife's working hours, my grandkids' school, etc.&nbsp;
        They knew everything. </p>
      <p>"The driver said that if I did not stop working on this (he
        then opened up the left side of his jacket and showed his weapon
        that was holstered) that there would be other consequences. </p>
      <p>"He also stated that he wanted me to post that I was no longer
        working in this field and to destroy all my work, i.e. Cells,
        Drawings, Lab Journals, everything! </p>
      <p>"At that point he walked around and got into the rig. I shut
        the hood and got the hell out of there. They followed me for
        about 2 miles and then must have turned off somewhere." </p>
      <p>After a few days of contemplation, Bill decided to abide by the
        demands of those who threatened him. He destroyed the cell and
        all data and documentation and disabled the website on which he
        had posted plans.&nbsp; Four days after that incident, Bill
        wrote the following message to the group: </p>
      <p>"I thought I was strong but when illness to the family comes
        into play, I have failed. I am truly sorry. I will not be
        working in any form of alternative energy field anymore. [...] </p>
      <p>"I destroyed my device tonight along with my written data and
        lab notes as per specked out." </p>
      <p><b><i>Bill's Description of his Vehicle's Performance:</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>Before deciding to abide by the demands of those who threatened
        him, Bill gave the following report on April 6, 2006: </p>
      <p><b><i>Report on the 70-mile test drive:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Well, all I can say is "who needs an Indy car when you can
        drive and old FORD" – WOW!!!! The first five-miles after leaving
        the home was wild. I had to be extremely careful on how I
        pressed the accelerator. I gingerly crept up to 45 MPH and that
        was about moving the pedal maybe a half-inch. It the throttle
        response was very crisp or touchy. With about a 1/8" of movement
        the next thing I new I was booking at close to 80 mph. If I
        lifted of ever so slightly on the throttle and it felt like I
        was putting the brakes on and the speed would drop down to 30
        mph or so. "Very erratic". If I barely even touch or bumped the
        pedal it felt like I pushed the nitrous button. WOW !!! </p>
      <p>As stated the first 5 miles were wild and things started to
        change. The engine started to buck or surge with very large rpm
        changes and literally threw me against my seat belt. It got so
        bad I just took my foot completely off the pedal and rode the
        brakes to stop the truck. The truck left skid marks on the
        pavement every time the engine surged in rpm. Well anyway I
        managed to get it stopped and shut it off with the ignition key,
        thank God. </p>
      <p>I retarded the timing and turn the gasoline back on and crossed
        my fingers and hit the key and the engine took right off revving
        to may be 4000 rpm and then gradually decreased to 700 rpm. I
        took a deep breath and put it into drive and the truck responded
        close to normal again. [...] </p>
      <p><i>Comments ---</i> The current setup is not happening, I could
        not drive the truck in city driving, because I would be ramming
        the vehicles ahead of me and smoking the tires at every stop
        light. Still more work to do, and that is going to start this
        weekend. Converting the engine back to a 2-barrel carb (hell who
        needs a 4 barrel with this setup) so to gain more room to setup
        the blind fitting arrangement. Going to machine a flat Aluminium
        plate to set between the carb and the manifold. The adapter will
        be cut with a section on the front side of the carb projecting
        out and have a solid Aluminium stub. The stub will be where the
        Aluminium transfer tube will attach via a short section of hose.
        Will update the group after the adapter and conversion is in
        place and some basic testing has been accomplished. [...] </p>
      <p>Regards, Bill </p>
      <p><b><i>Others Picking up Where Bill Williams Left Off:</i></b> </p>
      <p>A few days ago, close associates who were incensed at what had
        be-fallen him, re-opened the Joe's Cell 2 Yahoogroups site,
        which Bill had been ordered to disable, and are now making sure
        as many interested people as possible have access to all
        relevant details. </p>
      <p>The JoesCell2 group is for images.&nbsp; A discussion list has
        been formed at JoeCellFreeEnergyDevice, also a Yahoo!Group. </p>
      <p>An index page for this project is being created at PESWiki. </p>
      <p><b><i>Others Have Succeeded:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Bill is not the only one to have achieved this accomplishment
        of running his vehicle on a Joe Cell.&nbsp; John Carter, from
        Australia, estimates that there have been at least a dozen
        people who have achieved this -- running their vehicle on a Joe
        Cell. </p>
      <p>Carter said he took a ride the other day in a Ford Econovan
        that Peter Stephens converted to run on a Joe Cell.&nbsp; He
        said the car "rocketed up the hill" it had so much power. </p>
      <p>A good number of people now know how to do this, and the plans
        are being made available in diverse places. </p>
      <p>It would appear that Pandora's box has been opened on this,
        never to be shut. </p>
      <p><b><i>Controversial History:</i></b> </p>
      <p>The Joe Cell has a checkered past.&nbsp; Carter says that this
        is because a lot of people built it, but didn't know how to do
        it right, so there were a lot of failures in these replication
        attempts.&nbsp; There are unusual properties that cause people
        to stumble because they want to do things in a traditional
        manner. </p>
      <p>The technology is not new, but stretches back to as early as
        1834, with a more recent stint through New Zealand, before it
        took root in Australia, and then spread worldwide. </p>
      <p><b><i>Author's Personal Experience with a Joe Cell:</i></b> </p>
      <p>I have personally witnessed a modified Joe Cell technology in
        action.&nbsp; It is an awesome sight to behold.&nbsp; I wrote up
        that account in February, 2003.&nbsp; It was not being used to
        run cars, but was being used to produce magnetically charged
        water for health benefits. </p>

            made available on a limited basis to a few individuals. It
            describes a modified Joe cell technology that was called

            technology.</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>At night, when the upper cabinet is open for viewing, you can
        see deep blue lights along with and as bright as white lights
        streaking in from the top and up from the bottom of the bottle
        of water. These can't be seen except when it is quite
        dark.&nbsp; It's like something out of science fiction.&nbsp;
        The above image from another context gives you an idea. </p>
      <p>The device that creates this aetheric/magnetic water "came to"
        the inventor in a dream six years ago.&nbsp; It took him three
        days to build this device. It was actually initially intended to
        be a Tesla-like electrical generator that pulls energy from the
        aether. </p>
      <p>As the inventor pulled together the various components of the
        device, he needed a resistor.&nbsp; Being the resourceful guy
        that he is, he pulled out a glass of water and used that for the
        resistor. </p>
      <p>To his amazement, the water took on magnetic and
        electrical-like properties.&nbsp; He has used the device for
        that serendipitous purpose ever since. </p>
      <p>Soon after getting the device built, it ceased running for
        quite some time.&nbsp; It took him another three months to
        figure out how the machine worked and to get it to run yet
        again. </p>
      <p>Even so, the machine has a "personality" all its own.&nbsp;
        Sometimes, if someone comes into the premises who has highly
        negative emotions, the machine ceases to work.&nbsp; People who
        are "sensitive" to "energies" get an unusual sensation when the
        machine is operating. </p>
      <p>The inventor knows now that he needs to shield the machine so
        as to protect people from some of the nuclear particles that are
        emitted while it is in operation.&nbsp; For the first two or
        three years, the inventor used to remark, "The machine is
        killing me, and the water is keeping me alive." </p>
      <p>After the machine has been off for a while, when it is turned
        on, it takes about half a minute or so before the aetheric
        energies begin flowing.&nbsp; Until they flow, the machine
        generates ozone.&nbsp; Once the aetheric energies begin flowing,
        the adjoining Geiger counter immediately shows a strong reading
        from the alpha particles being emitted.&nbsp; This transition
        takes place and is observable with no additional flipping of
        switches.&nbsp; I was amazed to see it. </p>
      <p>People in the vicinity are now protected by a cabinet that has
        water between two layers of aluminum casing. To achieve this
        shielding cabinet, the inventor adapted an incubator from a
        University science department. </p>
      <p>The machine is in the bottom portion of the cabinet, and the
        bottles of water to be charged are situated in the upper
        cabinet. </p>
      <p>The first piece of equipment in the device is a motor. He used
        a 3 horse-power motor simply because that is what was available
        at the time. He thinks a 1/2 or 1/3-horse-power motor would do
        the trick. </p>
      <p>That first motor turns another motor which he adapted, and
        which is one of the proprietary components of the device. It
        entails a reconfiguration of the magnets and the coils so as to
        be able to pull in the aetheric energy. </p>
      <p>Next in line is a Joe Cell.&nbsp; For that, he took a
        motorcycle battery shell and adapted it (also proprietary) to
        the purpose specific to his device.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there, a
        larger cable is run a few times around a hollow coil.&nbsp; This
        "chokes" the aetheric energy so it doesn't burn up the device
        once the aetheric energies begin to flow.&nbsp; That cable then
        runs outside the lower chamber of the cabinet and then into the
        upper chamber where it is connected to a metallic rod with a
        conical end that can be raised and lowered into position to
        within 1/4 to 1/2 inche above the water that is to be "charged."
      </p>
      <p>At night, when the upper cabinet is open for viewing, you can
        see deep blue lights along with and as bright as white lights
        streaking in from the top and up from the bottom of the bottle
        of water. These can't be seen except when it is quite
        dark.&nbsp; It's like something out of science fiction. </p>
      <p>The inventor said that the aetheric energy is very slow
        compared to electricity that flows near the speed of
        light.&nbsp; Judging from timing how long it takes the aetheric
        energy to run through his set-up, he estimates that the aetheric
        energy he is tapping flows at around 2-3 feet per second. </p>
      <p>At some point, he plans to return to the task of adapting this
        incoming energy for use in our power grid.&nbsp; It may be as
        simple as connecting it to a bank of capacitors and then running
        that through an inverter to convert that DC power into usable
        AC. </p>
      <p>Eventually, through a smooth transition, he would like to see
        the AC power grid replaced by this more natural form of energy
        that is in harmony with life, not antithetical to it, as AC
        energy is.&nbsp; The power grid that crisscrosses the land
        actually blocks the natural aetheric flows of energy through the
        earth; and when it gets to a critical point, surpassing the
        earths ability to buffer, we will see some fantastic calamities
        result. </p>
      <p>He recommends that all AC wiring be run through the floors
        (then up to the outlets) and not through the walls, as is
        usually the case in construction. </p>
      <p>Speaking of electricity, the power company has paid him a visit
        twice, wondering why he is only using $20.00 of electricity per
        month, even though he has a shop in his garage with heavy
        equipment.&nbsp; They've checked his meter to make sure it is
        working right.&nbsp; It is. </p>
      <p>There was one time when he was developing the device that
        something very unusual happened regarding triggering breaker
        switches. One day, when he turned the device on, the power went
        out. He went to check the fuse box in his home, but none of the
        breakers were tripped. He then noticed down the road that the
        breaker on the power pole was tripped. The power company had to
        come out and re-set it. </p>
      <p>There's something going on there that we do not fully
        understand yet. </p>
      <p>To hold the cord going into the machine is a sensation in
        itself.&nbsp; People call it the "fuzzy caterpillar." </p>
      <p>Then there are the vortex storms he has over his house.&nbsp;
        He's lost nearly 1/3 of the shingles on his roof to micro-bursts
        from storms centered over his house, complete with lightning. </p>
      <p>One time he had a bunch of boxes in a fenced area prepared to
        burn them.&nbsp; One of these storms came along, and the next
        morning the boxes were arranged in a circle around his house. </p>
      <p>Another time, his friend was standing at the sink washing
        dishes, some 20 feet away from the machine.&nbsp; When the
        machine cycled through one of its phases, suddenly she was no
        longer standing in front of the sink, but was standing outside
        in a field.&nbsp; She saw people walking in the distance, and
        houses in the distance.&nbsp; Then the machine cycled through
        the next phase and instantly she was standing at the sink once
        again.&nbsp; My impression was that she was not moved through
        space but through time somehow. </p>
      <p>These are amazing times in which we live. </p>

            the astonishing claims surrounding it.&nbsp; This fuelless
            technology could make gasoline and diesel obsolete, while
            not requiring a change of the engine infrastructure now in
            existence.</i> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Sterling D. Allan, with Peter Stevens</b> <br>
          <b>Pure Energy Systems News</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>If you lived on a desert island and were never exposed to
        modern technology, what might you think the first time you
        witnessed such marvels as cordless phone communications, ground
        and air travel, running water, and so many other fascinating
        advancements? </p>
      <p>The claim to cars running on energy harnessed and directed by a
        Joe cell are equally astonishing to one well versed in the
        latest and greatest technologies of our day. To just hear about
        it is nearly too much to believe if you believe in the
        limitations that apply to a fuel-based energy paradigm. </p>
      <p>Imagine a device about five inches in diameter by ten inches
        long, with a tube running from it to a bolt on your engine. Your
        engine is running, but your fuel line is disconnected. Not only
        does the motor run, but it has far more power than it did when
        running on gasoline or diesel. And somehow the car responds to
        the accelerator, even though the fuel line is disconnected. That
        and other seemingly cognitive attributes of a Joe cell have
        spurred people to call it a "living cell." </p>
      <p>Weird; very weird -- and exciting. </p>
      <p>This device, which makes fueling up obsolete, can be built for
        less than $100 in parts. </p>
      <p>According to some proponents, electricity is what is being
        conveyed here. Others have experimented with the vapour. And
        others refer to it as a function of frequencies. Others invoke
        the living energy called Orgone, discovered and named by Wilhelm
        Reich in the mid-twentieth century. </p>
      <p>The extreme shift of thinking required drives some people to
        the head-in-the-sand, preserve-my-comfortable-conformity
        statement: "If it sounds too good to be true, then it probably
        is." </p>
      <p>Yet the number of people claiming to have achieved success with
        this phenomenon is growing. And the instructions of how to do so
        are becoming more clear, spawning yet more success. </p>
      <p>Add to this the reports of individuals who are threatened with
        death or some harm coming to a loved one if they don't stop,
        such as happened to Bill Williams on April 11, 2006. In the
        past, that has worked by isolating the victim. In today's
        globally-warmed climate of widespread ecological concern, such
        suppression attempts now seem to fuel the interest and
        involvement of others to replicate the phenomenon and report
        their success. </p>
      <p>Those pioneers, with a strong preponderance residing in
        Australia, who have worked for years on this technology, deserve
        a lot of credit for their inventiveness to try various things,
        as well as their tenacity to not give up. Perhaps these
        inventors from the land “down under” gravitate to this
        phenomenon because it seems so up-side-down from standard
        physics. Having "Joe" in their midst probably contributes as
        well, though the technology is actually at least a couple of
        centuryies old and arrived in Australia by way of Graham Coe
        from New Zealand. </p>
      <p>Sir William Groves patented the device in 1830. In 1926, Walter
        Russell showed in his periodic tables the abnormal energies
        associated with all matter. Many of his drawings illustrated
        this energy at work. </p>
      <p>A number of websites and discussion groups are springing up to
        help assure the continuance and expansion of the technology
        worldwide. We have created a project page at PESWiki for this
        purpose, which you can find by going to http://JoeCellHydra.com.
      </p>
      <p><b><i>Guidelines for Successful Operation:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Peter Stevens, an Australian, has spent about fourteen years
        pursuing this technology. He installed a Joe cell on his Ford
        Econovan, with a modified V6 GMH engine. He helped Bill Williams
        (U.S.) get his truck running on a Joe Cell. Stevens is more than
        happy to help anyone figure out how to make their Joe cell work,
        and is glad to share what he knows with the world via the
        propagation made possible by the Internet. </p>
      <p>The Joe Cell basically consists of several equally-spaced,
        concentric stainless steel cylinders, with water between them.
        Stevens recommends 3-1-6L, non-magnetic stainless steel. The
        number of cylinders and particular diameter and length of the
        cylinders do not seem to be crucial, though the ratios and
        proportionate spacing may be. </p>
      <p>According to Stevens, the idea is to form a polarity on each
        cylinder, so that they are positive on the outside and negative
        on the inside at the lowest point. Some cells that leak or lose
        charge can be remedied and be maintained by a 1.5-volt battery,
        which is not drained in the process. It just serves as a
        potential (polarity) reference. Adding to the apparent
        quirkiness of the technology, Stevens has noted that this
        booster charge seems to be dependent on lunar cycles, and is not
        necessary during some moon phases. However, the comeback is that
        this is not quirkiness, but further evidence for the Electric
        Cosmos concept, in which all planets, moons, comets and stars
        are recognized as interacting electrically. </p>
      <p>The connections of cylinders and caps and tubing generally need
        to be electrically insulated. However, standard insulating
        materials often don't work as they do with standard electrical
        processes but not with high-tension lead current.&nbsp; Stevens
        recommends natural rubber, without the colourings. That and
        other additives seem to short out or bleed the
        frequencies.&nbsp; This is an additional suggestion of a living
        energy at work; it is primarily life forms that are sensitive to
        additives in this way.&nbsp; Ordinary electricity is a
        non-living force indifferent to such subtleties. </p>
      <p>The central cylinder acts as the cathode tube. There is no
        positive lead coming from the cell. The cell does require
        charging to begin with for about 3-10 minutes. Stevens says that
        the central cathode is electrified up from the bottom insulated
        and the tube is in direct contact to the outside surface of the
        tube and not connected as some describe with a bolt wedged into
        the frequencies of energy from the cathode require negative to
        be on the outside. [Q / A] </p>
      <p>He says a little machining needs to be done on the cathode
        tube, making a threaded bolt hub that is welded to the tube via
        an inert gas shield welder, or tig. The hub should also have a
        couple of holes in the base to allow water to flow within the
        tube. The hub can then be sealed at the base insulating
        material. Alternatively, washers can be made from a material
        like Teflon knife cutting boards. This ¾-inch (20 mm) clearing
        is also a spark gap to the body of the vehicle. </p>
      <p>The jointing compound, marine-grade Sikaflex 291 should be used
        to make a water-tight seal between the cell and the mounting
        location. The hub is then able to support all the neutral tubes
        and allow for bolting to the car’s engine compartment. Don’t use
        silicon to seal. It breaks down and causes a mess that is
        difficult to clean up (requires a carbi cleaner). </p>
      <p>The charge from the inside cell is conveyed from the Joe cell
        to the engine via a 1/2 inch (12mm) diameter aluminium tubing.
        The tubing is connected to the outside of the cell. It has
        positive potential and needs to be clear of any objects That
        tubing needs to stay clear by at least four inches from things
        such as the radiator hoses, fuel lines, electrical lines, and AC
        lines. The other end of that tube line can be attached to pretty
        much any blind or blank bolt on the engine. It needs to be
        insulated with a ½ to ¾-inch gap using plastic tubing so as to
        keep the positively-charged cell from shorting out. </p>
      <p>If you can see the head of a bolt on top of the engine use it,
        so long as the aluminium line stays clear of the existing
        conducting lines in the engine compartment as just mentioned.
        There needs to be about a 3/4-inch gap between the line and the
        engine block for a "spark gap." The line can be connected to the
        bolt holding the air cleaner on the carburetor. </p>
      <p>The line can be connected under the carburetor to the PCV if
        you wish to use vacuum pressure. In the process of learning
        about the Joe cell, Stevens said this is how they thought they
        needed to start the cell producing.&nbsp; It results in a vary
        erratic response generally, and is difficult to tune.&nbsp; It
        is critical to have the timing 68-73 degrees advanced with this
        configuration. [Q/A] </p>
      <p>One of the videos in circulation shows an engine running as Joe
        is moving the high-tension lead from a spark plug along the
        engine with about a 1/2-inch gap. There is an arcing visible
        from the line to the engine block -- even into the radiator
        hose, air conditioning, fuel lines, and the Battery posts -- to
        show that the spark is a different frequency. This spark will
        jump into most things. </p>
      <p>The fuel line to the car does not need to be disconnected,
        though it does need to be shut off. Stevens says that if the
        fuel line is not disconnected, then the frequency disrupts the
        efficient running of the engine.&nbsp; He also recommends that
        an electric solenoid not be used in the fuel line, due to
        frequencies that it generates that conflict with the process. </p>
      <p>Also, the timing on the engine needs to be advanced quite a
        bit. "On the crank about 80 degrees", says Stevens. "Some run at
        70". </p>
      <p>Then comes the final step of operation. </p>
      <p>"To begin using the Cell it is best to arc off all the
        components --- negative to positive --- first at assembly then
        once together. Fill to the level of the tubes. Always put
        negative connection on the Joe Cell first. Then arc with
        positive 12 volts DC for three to ten minutes on the outside of
        the Joe cell. The engine should respond and start to accept the
        energy. Some gasket material absorbs the energy, but arcing the
        crank with a brush action to flash positive then negative will
        often overcome the barriers. Make sure you have a long
        screwdriver and hands clear, with an assistant rotating the
        motor on the start coil lead, disconnected, then all clear.
        Reconnect leads and happy driving." </p>
      <p><b><i>Scaling:</i></b> </p>
      <p>Stevens says the Joe Cell could be made as small as a 35mm film
        container, which could run a 30cc brush cutter. He says a
        two-inch unit will run an ultra-light aircraft engine. </p>
      <p>These instructions will continue to be expanded, clarified,
        upgraded, and illustrated at the JoeCellHydra.com site. </p>
