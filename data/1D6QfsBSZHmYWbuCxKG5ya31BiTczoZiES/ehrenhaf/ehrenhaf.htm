      <p><i>If this experimenter is right, his discovery will upset all
          out accepted ideas on this familiar force</i> </p>
      <p>Can a magnet take water to pieces? No, say physics textbooks.
        Yes, says Prof. Felix Ehrenhaft, former director of the Physical
        Institute at the University of Vienna, who now carries on his
        research in New York. If he should turn out to be right, his
        findings in the realm of magnetism promise practical
        applications as far-reaching as the dynamos, motors,
        transformers, telephones, and radio that have stemmed from
        Faraday’s research in electricity. </p>
      <p>For his "impossible" experiment, Dr Ehrenhaft employs the
        simplest of apparatus. Two shiny rods of pure Swedish iron,
        sealed in holes through opposite sides of a U-shaped tube,
        resemble a setup familiar to high-school students for breaking
        up water into hydrogen and oxygen gases by passing electricity
        through it. And that is exactly what would happen if Dr
        Ehrenhaft attached electric wires from a battery to the rods.
        But, he does no such thing. </p>
      <p>Instead, he uses the iron rods as pole pieces, or North and
        South ends of a magnet --- either an electromagnet or a
        permanent magnet. Bubbles of gas rise through the twin columns
        of acidulated water, to be collected and analyzed. As might be
        expected, nearly all of the gas is hydrogen, liberated by a
        commonplace chemical interaction between the iron rods and
        sulfuric acid, one percent by volume, in the water. But the
        phenomenal part of the experiment is that oxygen also turns up,
        Dr Ehrenhaft recently told the American Physical Society. To be
        specific, it is found in clearly measurable proportions ranging
        from 2 to 12% of the total volume of gases. When the gases
        obtained with a permanent magnet are separated, the larger
        proportion of oxygen is found above the north pole of the
        magnet. After rigorous precautions that seem to rule out all
        other explanations --- including short-circuiting the magnet
        poles with wire, so that the poles will be at the same electric
        potential --- Dr Ehrenhaft concludes that there is only one
        place the oxygen can come from. And that is from the water
        decomposed with a magnet! Without a magnet, pure hydrogen is
        evolved. </p>
      <p>There is an interesting sidelight to this experiment. A strong
        permanent magnet of the Alnico type suffers a marked loss of
        strength --- say, 10% in 24 hours --- after being used to
        decompose water, Dr Ehrenhaft observes. In fact, makers of the
        magnets, which are supposed to last for years without material
        change, have viewed what happens to them with astonishment and
        dismay. But no fault lies with their products. Energy from an
        electric battery is used up in decomposing water, and it would
        be only reasonable to expect energy stored in up in a permanent
        magnet to be drained likewise. </p>
      <p>What gives the utmost significance to the reported feat of
        breaking up water with a magnet is the fresh evidence it offers
        for the existence of "magnetic current", or a flow of
        magnetically charged particles, which has been suspected by
        noted pioneers and which Dr Ehrenhaft now maintains he has
        proved. Confirmation of this amazing discovery would point to a
        possible future rival of electric current, perhaps capable of
        being harnesses in undreamed-of ways. </p>
      <p>Needless to say, the scientific world will require a whole lot
        of convincing, since Dr Ehrenhaft’s conclusions flatly
        contradict long-established beliefs. As every schoolboy is
        taught, a magnet has a north pole and a south pole. Break it in
        two with a hammer, and each piece will have a north pole and
        south pole of its own. No law forbids you to imagine a magnet
        with only one pole, and the idea comes in handy in certain
        electrical and radio calculations. But as for actual fact, you
        cannot have one pole without the other, an experimenter named
        Peter Peregrinus believed; he demonstrated it to his
        satisfaction, using a lodestone, in the year 1269, and
        prevailing opinion has backed him up ever since. As we kiow now,
        the lodestone that he floated on a platform in water simply
        turned until its north pole faced the south magnetic pole of the
        earth, and vice versa. It showed no observable excess of north
        or of south magnetism --- and hence the conclusion that the two
        are always equal. </p>
      <p>But would the dictum of no separate magnetic poles still hold
        true in a far more delicate test --- say, if you substituted
        microscopic particles of iron or other magnetic metals, as tiny
        as particles of smoke, for the massive chunk of rock that
        Peregrinus used? Dr Ehrenhaft has tried it. In an air gap
        between the north and south poles of a magnet, he sets up what
        he calls a homogenous magnetic field, that is, with the lines of
        force absolutely parallel. In this field, he finds, the meal
        particles move toward the north or south pole, reversing their
        direction according to the direction of the magnetic field. In
        the particles, he concludes, there must be an excess of N or S
        magnetic charge. Expanding the terminology of Faraday, he calls
        the particles magnetic ions. They are the single magnetic poles
        shown at the lower right of the drawing. Instead of bearing plus
        or minus electric charges, as familiar ions do, they carry N or
        S magnetic charges. </p>
      <p>Now, just as traveling electric ions form an electric current,
        why shouldn’t traveling magnetic ions form a magnetic current?
        See for yourself another of Dr Ehrenhaft’s startling
        experiments, and draw your own conclusions. </p>
      <p>This time the heart of the apparatus will be a small glass
        cell, fitted as before with pole pieces of pure iron that dip
        into water containing one percent of sulfuric acid. An
        electromagnet, turned on or off at will, energizes the poles.
        From a projector, a powerful beam of light converges upon the
        narrow gap between the pole pieces, and a low-power microscope,
        mounted horizontally, reveals that happens there. Adding a
        camera provides a permanent record. </p>
      <p>You begin with the magnet turned off. Looking into the eyepiece
        of the microscope, you see streams of bubbles rising from both
        pole pieces. They are of hydrogen gas, liberated by the same
        chemical action as the first experiment. </p>
      <p>Throw the switch that turns on the magnet, and the scene
        abruptly changes. Stopped dead in their tracks, some of the
        bubbles cling to the pole pieces. Others leave one pole and
        travel to the other. Dr Ehrenhaft calls special attention to
        bubbles moving downward against their own buoyancy, impelled by
        some unseen force stronger than gravity. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile a spectacular phenomenon has been developing --- a
        miniature merry-go-round of gas bubbles between the faces of the
        poles and parallel to them. Incapable of being shown adequately
        in a time exposure, the effect nevertheless appears plainly as a
        white blur, when the upper magnetic pole is given a conical
        shape for photographic purposes. Visual observation shows
        striking details. If copper particles, say, have been added to
        the acidulated water, they will rotate in the same plane as the
        hydrogen bubbles, but in the opposite direction. For both, the
        speed of the whirligig depends upon the strength of the magnetic
        field. Reverse the polarity of the magnet, and each set of
        particles spins in the opposite direction. </p>
      <p>Here are no wild-eyed theories, but perfectly demonstrable
        facts. Any skeptical physicist has a standing invitation to see
        them with his own eyes at Dr Ehrenhaft’s laboratory, placed at
        his disposal in the New York City quarters of the famous Carl
        Zeiss optical firm. How to account for the phenomena remains a
        challenge to science, unless Dr Ehrenhaft’s conclusions are to
        be accepted. See how neatly they would draw an analogy between
        well-known electric effects and the new-found magnetic effects:
      </p>
      <p>Bubbles or particles that travel between pole pieces of a
        magnet behave just as if they were magnetic ions, or clusters of
        thyem --- repelled by like magnetic poles, and attracted by
        oppositely magnetized poles. This corresponds exactly with the
        way that "electric"or ordinary ions interact with positive and
        negative electrodes. And as for the ring-around-the-rosy
        behavior of the hydrogen bubbles and copper particles, Dr
        Ehrenhaft concludes that these are electrically charged
        particles --- ordinary ions--- rotating about a magnetic
        current. This would be an exact counterpart of the classical
        conception that magnetism rotates about a current-carrying
        electric conductor. </p>
      <p>Now the staggering implications of Dr Ehrenhaft's observations
        begin to unfold. Existence of such a thing as magnetic current,
        once established, would pave the way for inductries as gigantic
        as those that the discovery of electricity led to in its time. A
        "gold rush" for practical applications might be expected.
        Patents for them would command fabulous sums, since inventions
        employing magnetic current would be basic. </p>
      <p>What form they may take, no man can foresee, and Dr Ehrenhaft
        cautiouslydeclaines to hazard a guess. Yet a visitor to his
        laboratory cannot resist the temptation to let his imagination
        run free. New kinds of motors and generators? Better ways to
        transmit power? Transformers that will work on direct current
        isntead of alternating current? Atom smashers? Radical methods
        of seeing things in the dark, and through microscopes and
        telescopes? Ways to tap power from the magnetism of the Earth
        itself? And, in your home, substitution of magnetic current ---
        who ever got a shock from it? --- for electric current? Pure
        dreams, all of them, today --- but some of them, perhaps,
        realities of 2044. </p>
      <p>Before magnetic currents could be put in harness, of course, a
        myriad of questions about their behavior remain to be studied
        and answered. So far, no one knows whether they can be led
        through wires, like electric currnets, as well as through
        conducting liquids. If so, the wires might be of entirely
        different materials than the best conductors for electricity.
        Likewise, the most effective insulators for magnetic current
        might be substances totally unlike those used for electrical
        insulators. The whole subject offers as vast a field for
        pioneering research as electricity did a century ago. And now,
        as then, an amateur experimenter puttering in his basement
        stands as good achance of making an epochal discovery as does a
        distinguished scientist in a great laboratory. <br>

        confirm the phenomenal discovery of magnetic currents by Dr.
        Felix Ehrenhaft (P.S.M., June 1944, p. 130). Going further, they
        make a drop of copper sulfate solution spin between the pole
        pieces of a permanent magnet, even rotating in interposed

        lead to momentous applications in power machinery of the future.

      <p><b>Discovery of the Age? ~</b> </p>
      <p>In March 1944, <i>Radio-Craft</i> published an article,
        "Magnetic Current --- Discovery of the Age?". It described the
        work of refugee scientist Felix Ehrenhaft, Director of the
        Physics Institute, University of Vienna. Ehrenhaft believed that
        he had discovered particles with a one-pole magnetic charge
        (either N or S but not both). Beaming light on the gap between
        the poles of a powerful electromagnet, on the lower pole piece
        of which powdered metal had been scattered, he found that when
        the magnet was activated he could see some of the particles
        spring from the lower to the upper pole. Ehrenhaft believed that
        this indicated that they had a monopolar magnetic charge (Others
        were not so sure). </p>
      <p>The work attracted a great deal of attention. <i>Radio-Craft</i>
        devoted two articles and an editorial to it. There is a gap in
        electromagnetic theory that would be filled neatly by monopole
        magnets and magnetic current, and students were extremely
        interested. Ehrenhaft made a number of other experiments that
        supported his hypothesis. Unfortunately one of the most dramatic
        ones --- indicating that water could be decomposed magnetically
        --- went wrong. It was absolutely unrepeatable. The professor
        was tremendously embarrassed, and to some extent withdrew from
        public discussion, carrying on his experimental work in the
        semi-seclusion of Manhattan College. </p>
      <p>He returned to his post in Vienna after the war, and some of
        his later work was published in French and other scientific
        journals. He died not so long after, and interest in magnetic
        monopoles seemed to have died with him, until about 1970. Then
        one H.R. Kolm reported finding a track produced by a particle
        that was strongly accelerated in a magnetic field, something
        that might indicate a monopole magnet. He never published a
        formal paper on the subject, and presumably did not feel that he
        had enough evidence that a magnetic monopole existed. </p>
      <p>In 1975, scientists of the University of California and of the
        University of Houstton (TX) reported the existence of a
        particle, far heavier than any yet discovered, that fitted the
        characteristics of a magnetic monopole as laid down
        theoretically by Dirac in 1931. For one thing Dirac had
        suggested that the particle --- if it existed --- should have a
        basic charge of 68.5 or a multiple of that number. The suspected
        particles had a charge of 137. </p>
      <p>Three years later no further discoveries have been reported. An
        inquiry to Dr Alfred Goldhaber, who commented with interest on
        the 1975 discovery, reveals that though he has been doing
        theoretical work on the subject since 1975, "neither I nor
        anyone else has any evidence of the existence of magnetic
        monopoles". The final conclusion of the 1975 experimenters, he
        said, were that the track was not compatible with the magnetic
        monopole. </p>
      <p>So the subject is still open. Theoretically, there is a place
        in the universe for magnetic monopoles, but apparently so far
        nobody has ever "seen" one. </p>

            and the Flying Saucer</i> (pp. 154-156)</b> </p>
      <p><b>[Excerpt]</b> </p>
      <p>Here is an account of an experiment carried out by the
        well-known Viennese physicist Felix Ehrenhaft, whose work may
        prove to be an inspiration to students of this new approach to
        Kinematics. </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft and his colleague, Ernst Reeger, have proved that
        there is more than a little truth in the suspicion that tiny
        particles of dust tend to rotate when exposed to the rays of the
        sun. For they have not only reproduced this phenomenon in the
        laboratory, but they have succeeded in photographing it as well.
        In order to do this, Ehrenhaft placed tiny graphite particles
        into a glass flask, from which the air was completely evacuated.
        Then the flask was exposed to focused beams of sunlight.
        Instantly a large number of particles were seen to rise from the
        bottom of the flask and start to weave elliptical, circular and
        spiral-shaped paths, which were quite visible to the naked eye.
        The phenomenon ceased as soon as the light was weakened or cut
        off completely. Photographs taken at one-fifth and one-tenth of
        a second proved that not only were the particles orbiting, but
        more significantly, they were spinning on their own axis. </p>
      <p>It is of interest to note that Ehrenhaft would like to relate
        the phenomenon to his own theory of a new type of physical
        force. He suggests that it is a purely ‘magnetic’ force which

        <p><b>By Kristen Joseph</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The following is a review of the work of Felix Ehrenhaft,
        affiliated with the Physical Institute at the State University
        of Vienna for most of his career. He began as an assistant
        professor in 1907 and held the post of director by 1920. In 1938
        he left Austria for the United States and became a citizen the
        following year. In 1944, at a conference at Columbia University,
        where he had a lab, he revealed his various theories. Six months
        later Ehrenhaft gave further evidence of magnetic monopoles at a
        conference of the American Physical Society at Rochester
        University. He died in Vienna in 1952 at the age of 73. </p>
      <p>We thank Jennifer Piel for graciously providing the reference
        material for this article. </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft was head of the Physical Institute of the State
        University of Vienna until shortly after Germany took Austria in
        1938. He experimented with the behavior of minute particles
        under intense illumination in a field of electricity. His work
        began to suggest that a light wave carries tiny, energizing
        power stations of varying magnitude and pole, which could
        transfer energy and charge to particles of matter in the path of
        that light. He showed that light could propel matter and, later
        on, that ultraviolet light, for instance, magnetizes iron. </p>
      <p>In measuring the effects that these power stations in a light
        wave have on ions, Ehrenhaft used a very small condenser and was
        able to measure forces a small as 1<sup>-10</sup> dynes,
        determining charges on particles to be 2.9 x 1<sup>-10</sup>
        esu, which is considerably smaller than the –1.60 x 10<sup>-19</sup>
        coulomb (4.8 x 10<sup>-10</sup> esu) that his contemporary
        Millikan attributed to the electron --- the value science
        accepts as standard to this day. </p>
      <p><b>Micro-Manipulation ~</b> </p>
      <p>He worked with particles so exceedingly small (10<sup>-4</sup>
        to 10<sup>-5</sup> cm diam., +/- 0.1 to 1 micron) that several
        had to be lined up by micromanipulation before their end-to-end
        diameters added up enough to be measured, and it was perhaps
        because such extremely complex calculations went into measuring
        the charges on those particles that scientists in Ehrenhaft’s
        day discounted the final results of his experiments, which he
        concluded in 1937. </p>
      <p><b>Single Poles ~</b> </p>
      <p>But perhaps of greatest impact is Ehrenhaft’s discovery,
        through numerous verifiable experiments using light, minute
        particles and magnetic fields, that magnets appear to carry a
        single pole, and therefore, that a magnetic current exists
        separately from the static magnetism of a magnetic field. </p>
      <p>Conventional wisdom has it that magnetic poles always occur in
        pairs of opposites and that it is not possible for a magnetized
        object to have a north pole without an attached south pole. </p>
      <p><b>Peregrinus ~</b> </p>
      <p>Based&nbsp; on the experiment reportedly done by Petrus
        Peregrinus in 1629, if a magnet is broken, new poles appear near
        the break in such a way that each pole has two opposite poles as
        well. </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft identified the problem with that crude experiment ---
        the lodestone Peregrinus put on a cork and floated in a bowl of
        water had too little mobility with respect to the geomagnetic
        field, and the very act of breaking it in pieces created
        magnetism through friction. </p>
      <p>When Ehrenhaft repeated this experiment with very sensitive
        equipment, particles of microscopic size and a strong
        homogeneous field, he got different results. </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft set up a condenser with plates 8 mm in diameter and
        about 2 mm apart on the face of iron cylinders, thereby creating
        a vertical magnetic field that could be reversed at will. </p>
      <p>He also could apply a reversible electric field if needed,
        going in the same direction but independent of the magnetic
        field. All observations were made with a dark field microscope.
        With his assistant, Leo Banet, he reported the following effects
        in the September 4, 1942 issue of Science: </p>
      <p>"If one places a minute amount of very fine powder, such as Fe,
        Ni, Mn, Cr, Sb in the exact center of the lower magnetrode, one
        can see, as soon as the magnetic field is applied, that some of
        the particles move toward the upper plate, while others remain
        at rest. It is also possible to place some particles on the
        upper plate, while others remain at rest. It is also possible to
        place some particles on the upper plate only. Of these, some
        move toward the lower magnetrode as soon as the magnetic field
        is applied, while the others remain at rest. It is even possible
        to combine both experiments at the same time. One then observes
        that some of the particles move toward the N and some toward the
        S magnetrode, carrying charges opposite to those of the plates
        to which they move. The particles arrange themselves on the
        magnetrodes in the direction of the lines of force and in
        needle-like masses parallel to each other and perpendicular to
        the plates". (Ref. !4) </p>
      <p><b>Magneto-Phoresis ~</b> </p>
      <p>He reported similar polarization of the particles regardless of
        whether they were suspended in gas or liquid, and they behaved
        similarly when they were placed in either the homogenous
        electric or magnetic field: </p>
      <p>"However, the difference could be particularly well noticed on
        Cu particles, which moved only in electric fields but not in
        magnetic ones, and on some iron particles which moved in
        magnetic particles but not in electric ones" (Ref. 14). </p>
      <p>Also, some particles seemed to spontaneously change direction,
        and some seemed to tremble or waver between moving in either
        direction, and Ehrenhaft attributed this to a spontaneous change
        in magnetic charge on these particles. He dubbed the entire
        phenomenon ‘magneto-phoresis’ (See Figure 1). </p>

        <p><img src="c1.gif" height="326" width="375"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Ampere Refuted ~</b> </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft’s discovery of these magnetic ions refuted Ampere’s
        hypothesis that the effects of a magnet can be substituted by
        circular electric currents. Ampere’s electromagnets have two
        poles. Ehrenhaft showed that some particles behave like
        monopoles. To substantiate his claim that he had discovered
        magnetic ions, and thus magnetic current, he set out to show
        that magnetic current could produce the same effect as electric
        current --- that the magnetic current would cause electric ions
        to rotate around it in line of circular force. </p>
      <p>Like electric ions or current, magnetic ions would do chemical
        work. </p>
      <p>If he is right, the process of electrolysis, or decomposing
        water using electric poles (that had proven the existence of
        electric ions) could be made to happen in a magnetic field,
        thereby achieving magnetolysis and proving magnetic current by
        the same criteria. </p>
      <p>To accomplish that experimentally, Ehrenhaft set up an
        electromagnet with soft iron poles that faced into dilute
        sulfuric acid, electrically insulated from the iron magnet core
        (See Figure 2). As one observer noted: </p>
      <p>"When a little electric current was applied, the dilute acid
        was, of course, electrolyzed, and streams of bubbles rose from
        the poles. These bubbles, naturally, were electrically charged;
        the poles from which they evolved were charged. If the magnetic
        current existed, and if it could be made to flow from pole to
        pole through the acid solution, then the bubbles should, on the
        basis of theory, go into rotation around the unseen magnetic
        current. </p>
      <p>"When the electromagnet was turned on, the rising bubbles
        instantly and violently twisted into a rapid rotation --- rapid
        and violent to be far beyond any question of accidental eddies
        of liquid convection or anything else. Reversing the magnetic
        current stopped the rotation then started it equally rapidly in
        the opposite direction". </p>

        <p><img src="c2.gif" height="616" width="399"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Magnetolysis ~</b> </p>
      <p>There remained the question of magnetolysis that Ehrenhaft
        demonstrated using the same electromagnetic setup. This time,
        however, he short-circuited the two magnetrodes by linking them
        with a piece of wire, thus making electrolysis impossible. When
        the magnetic field was turned on, the natural slow evolution of
        bubbles speeded up; when collected and evaluated after some time
        a respectable percentage of those bubbles were found to be
        oxygen. </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft gave details of the experiment in <i>Physical Review</i>
        in 1943: </p>
      <p>"Between the vertical cylindrical poles (magnetrodes) of an
        electromagnet of soft Swedish iron, whose bases form a
        horizontal gap (pole diameter 8 mm, gap 1-2 mm) acidulated water
        (1% sulfuric acid by volume) is decomposed into oxygen and
        hydrogen gas... As long as the two poles immersed in the
        solution are not magnetized, we get pure hydrogen, but as soon
        as the two poles are magnetized, we get a mixture of hydrogen
        and oxygen (about 2-12% oxygen)". (Ref. 8) </p>
      <p>Since chemical action alone would not yield oxygen, some
        additional process was at work breaking down the water to its
        elements. </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft continued: </p>
      <p>"Microscopic observation shows that the magnetically evolved
        gas bubbles carry either a N or S magnetic charge... Each of
        these positive charged gas bubbles moves in a circle around the
        gap between the magnetrodes, through which a constant magnetic
        currnet flows, reversing its direction on reversion of the
        magnetic field, exactly as a single magnetic pole would
        circulate around the constant electric current, reversing its
        direction with the reversal of the electric field". (Ref. 8) </p>
      <p><b>Magnetic Current ~</b> </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft discovered that a magnetic current is surrounded by
        circular electric lines of force and that the magnetic charge of
        the magnet could be set free by making it release oxygen gas
        from acidulated water. </p>
      <p>Interestingly, as John W. Campbell, Jr. pointed out in his
        article on Ehrenhaft in the May 1944 issue of <i>Astounding
          Science Fiction</i>, electrically charged particles do not
        rotate detectably around the gap between the poles of a
        permanent magnet. He noted the reason for this was: "[T]he
        permanent magnet represents stored magnetic energy --- static
        magnetic field energy, pretty solidly tied down", similar to an
        electret, the magnet’s counterpart (The electret has stored
        electric-field energy that it cannot release as current). "The
        permanent magnet does not, therefore, have a magnetic current
        associated with it. The observed lack of rotation, then,
        conforms with theory". (Ref. 1) </p>
      <p><b>Measuring Magnetic Current ~</b> </p>
      <p>Assuming the existence of magnetic current, Ehrenhaft wanted to
        measure it, and he did it the same way Ampere first quantified
        the nature of electric current. Ampere stated that a single
        magnetic pole would whirl around a wire carrying an electric
        current, the intensity of which was measured by the work done by
        carrying a unit magnetic pole once around the entire electric
        current. </p>
      <p>In an experiment described in <i>Physical Review</i> 1944
        (Ref. 12), Ehrenhaft learned that permanent magnets lose a
        portion of their pole strength during the magnetolysis process:
      </p>
      <p>"Dr Ehrenhaft has set up an alnico magnet, and drained the pole
        strength by approximately 10% in 60 hours in one case, and with
        another magnet the same pole-strength reduction was accomplished
        in 24 hours". (Ref. 1) </p>
      <p>This is the counterpart of the loss in pole-strength of Volta’s
        pile during electrolysis, indicating the average intensity of
        the magnetic current flowing between the pole faces in what
        Ehrenhaft termed "absolute magneto-static units" or msu. In the
        magnetic version of Ampere’s statement, he observed: </p>
      <p>"The intensity of the magnetic current measured electrically is
        equal to the work done in carrying a unit electric charge once
        about the electromagnetic current". (Ref. 5) </p>
      <p>For example, the numerical value of the magnetic charge on a
        single particle of nickel in gas could be smaller than 5 x 1<sup>-10</sup>
        msu. </p>
      <p><b>Electric and Magnetic Charges ~</b> </p>
      <p>In subsequent experiments Ehrenhaft established that particles
        can carry both electric and magnetic charges at the same time as
        evidenced by their motion in gas or liquid. He theorized that
        the magnetic charge equaled the electric charge on particles of
        the same size. In one experiment, the particles rotated around
        the magnetic current because of their electric charges. Because
        of their magnetic charges, bubbles moved either upeard or
        downward. Their resulting path was a helix and could be seen
        "even by the naked eye to be circulating in a counterclockwise
        direction, when looking upon the face of the S pole. This
        movement carried the bubbles downward, even against the force of
        buoyancy". (Ref. 12) </p>
      <p><b>The Third Force ~</b> </p>
      <p>The ramifications of what Ehrenhaft discovered can only be
        guessed at: </p>
      <p>"It is the belief today that there exist in nature only two
        general forces, the force of gravity and the magnetic action of
        electric currents. But we have here a third force, the electric
        action of magnetic currents". (Ref. 12) </p>
      <p>In the same letter to the editors of <i>Physical Review</i>,
        he wrote: </p>
      <p>"Oersted found... a vortex around the wire connecting the two
        poles of Volta’s pile. The phenomena here reported show that
        there is a vortex around the poles of an electro- or permanent
        magnet. In Oersted’s experiment, the pile lost its pole
        strength. In the experiment with the permanent magnet, the
        magnet lost its pole strength. In Oersted’s experiment, we have
        to deal with electrodynamic rotations. In the new case, we have
        to deal with magnetodynamic rotations. Both rotations are the
        result of the expenditure of energy, one from Volta’s pile, the
        other from the magnet. </p>
      <p>"If the single magnetic pole is fixed and alone in action, the
        opposite pole being remote as is done in Faraday’s experiment,
        and the wire conducting the electric current is free to move,
        the wire will rotate around the single pole. This is the
        principle of the electric motor... </p>
      <p>"In the new case... we have two fixed magnetic poles with the
        electrically charged matter free to rotate around the magnetic
        current. This is, in principio, the magnetic motor. We are here
        using our third force. One cannot tell how a motor operated by
        this force can be utilized". (Ref. 12) </p>
      <p><b>Magnetic Motors ~</b> </p>
      <p>Science writer John W. Campbell, Jr, however, envisioned
        magnetic charges with mutual attraction forces equivalent to
        millions of volts operating in small practical machines. He
        speculated that, "A magneto-electret --- consisting of a coil of
        magnetic conductor carrying a heavy magnetic current --- would
        develop electric potentials that did not tend to arc across.
        Perhaps a small magnetic coil would develop 50,000,000 volt
        potentials that could tear atoms apart". (Ref. 1) </p>
      <p><b>Twins ~</b> </p>
      <p>But perhaps of far greater importance, Ehrenhaft pointed out,
        "is the necessity to define more clearly the part that the
        inseparable twins, electricity and magnetism, play in their
        interaction, one on another, and to determine if, in the future,
        they can best be defined by one symbol only" (Ref. 12). </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion ~</b> </p>
      <p>Ehrenhaft’s work with the effects of intense light beams on
        small particles was never conclusive. He did show, however, that
        light beams of short frequency could repel and attract some
        small particles; that matter thus excited by light tended to
        move along magnetic lines of force much like he speculated that
        the gases in a star’s corona took shape as though surrounding a
        magnetized sphere. </p>
      <p>He pointed out that the intense light and magnetic current
        flowing from the sun to the earth along the lines of force of
        the Earth’s magnetic field was likely creating the aurora
        borealis and other magnetic effects still little understood
        today. </p>

      <p>According to then electromagnetic theory of light (Maxwell,
        Hertz) the electric light vector and the magnetic light vector
        oscillate perpendicularly to the direction of propagation. The
        energy of the wave is given by Poynting’s vector. </p>
      <p>It is shown below, on the basis of experimental findings, that
        every wave of light possesses likewise a stationary field
        intensity E in its direction of propagation and also the
        stationary magnetic field of intensity H. That means there is a
        potential difference between two points on the ray of light.
        Accordingly, it should be possible to collect electricity from
        the ray under suitable conditions. A beam of light therefore
        constitutes a source of electricity; furthermore, light has
        magnetizing effects. </p>
      <p>Experimental proof of this generalization was obtained from my
        investigations of the interaction between light and small
        particles of matter (<i>Ann. Phys</i>. 18: 151). This permits of
        the measurement of forces of the order of 10<sup>-9</sup> to 10<sup>-19</sup>
        dynes. The sensitivity of measurements of forces is thus
        increased by my methods by a factor of 1,000-10,000 </p>
      <p>When particles of matter are irradiated by sufficiently intense
        light of sufficiently small wavelength, regardless of the
        direction of the wave front normal, then positive or negative
        electric charges, or north or south magnetic poles, are induced
        on these particles. Particles of otherwise identical properties
        move in a homogeneous electric or in a&nbsp; homeogeous magnetic
        field in or against the direction of the electric field
        (electro-photophoresis), or in or against the direction of the
        magnetic field (magneto-photophoresis). These induced temporary
        electric or magnetic ions exist as long as the particles are
        irradiated by sufficiently intense light. Furthermore, it can be
        observed that some particles stay at rest and that their motion
        commences suddenly,or that moving particles appear to change
        their velocity and even reverse it. These are due to changes of
        charge. The movement of magnetic ions in a homogenous magnetic
        field is a ‘magnetic currnet’. </p>
      <p>These phenomena are best observed when two fully symmetrical
        beams of light are directed against each other and when the
        fields act perpendicularly, are reversible and free from
        residual magnetism and electricity, and are also homogeneous.
        The intensity of this motion depends upon the frequency of the
        light wave. It increases with increasing frequency and is also
        dependent on the material. I have also found that, when using
        just one concentrated beam of light, without any field, small
        particles of matter of magnitude 10<sup>-4</sup> to 1<sup>-5</sup>
        cm of the same kind as before moved in clean gases either away
        from the source of light (light-positive, longitudinal
        photophoresis) or towards the source of light (light negative,
        longitudinal photophoresis). This force increases with the
        intensity of the light and likewise depends upon frequency and
        material. </p>
      <p>There are particles which do not show longitudinal
        photophoresis at first, but only after a certain time, and some
        which gradually lose it. I have shown in another paper also that
        radiometer forces cannot account for these effects (<i>J.
          Franklin Inst.</i> 230: 381). Longitudinal photophoresis has
        also been found in liquids with particles of the same material.
        These particles moved in opposite directions. </p>
      <p>Since light makes particles of matter unipolar with respect to
        homogeneous electric fields, and since, when no such fields act,
        it makes them move in or against the direction of its wave front
        normal, there must be an electric field E coincident with the
        direction of the wave front normal. This means that
        electromagnetic waves possess longitudinal stationary components
        of E, and therefore potential differences between different
        points along the beam. The magnitude of those fields can be
        calculated from actual measurements. </p>
      <p>These facs have been confirmed by further experiments by myself
        and some of my pupils. An electric field suitably arranged
        parallel to the wave front normal permits the acceleration or
        retardation or even reversal of positive or negative
        photophoresis. The superposed field alters the component of the
        electromotive force in the direction of the beam. </p>
      <p>From similar experiments it can be concluded that
        stationary&nbsp; magnetic fields exist in the beam of light,
        since superposed magnetic fields accelerate or retard the
        magneto-photophoresis. Those stationary magnetic fields in the
        beam of light have a magnetizing effect on the material as above
        mentioned. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, I find that light beams have electric stationary
        components in the direction of the wave front normal, and that
        consequently there must be stationary electric potential
        differences between different points along the beam. There must
        also be a stationary magnetic field in the beam of light with
        potential differences. <br>

      <p>One of us (F.E.) has shown that small particles of matter of
        different chemical elements, but of the same physical qualities,
        irradiated by concentrated light, move in a homogeneous magnetic
        field, some of them toward the N, some toward the S pole
        (magnetrode). Therefore, there must be a preponderance of either
        N or S magnetism on each of these irradiated particles, and they
        behave like single magnetic poles (charges)(Ref. 1). Further,
        experiment led to the conclusion (Ref. 2) that, in addition to
        the oscillating electric and magnetic vectors, light beams must
        have electric stationary components in the direction of the wave
        front normal, and that consequently there must be stationary
        electric potential differences between different points along
        the beam; and that there must be also a stationary magnetic
        field in the beam of light with potential differences. Hence,
        the light beam must have a magnetizing effect, and the charge of
        a magnet should be changed by light. </p>
      <p>Examination of the literature showed that even before the time
        of Oerstedt’s experiments, Domenico Morichini (Ref. 3) in 1812
        magnetized compass needles by means of the ultraviolet portion
        of the spectrum of sunlight as used by Herschel. His experiments
        were verified by M. Sommerville (Ref. 4), F. Zantedeschi (Ref.
        5), V. Baumgartner (Ref. 6) and others. </p>
      <p>We therefore undertook to test the photomagnetic effect also on
        larger bodies in continuation of the above-mentioned fundamental
        experiments in continuation of the microscopic bodies
        (magneto-photophoresis), through which the general magnetization
        of the elements and the existence of magnetic ‘currents’ was
        brought to light. The experiments were successful with the
        simplest apparatus, undertaken in a private apartment with a 10
        cent compass needle from Woolworth’s as an indicator, and using
        a beam of light rich in ultraviolet radiation (Hanovia mercury
        arc, Max=zda GE daylight bulb) which was contained by means of
        quartz lesnes. </p>
      <p>Magnetic poles (charges) were induced in various non-magnetic
        and annealed pieces of iron (paperclips, nails,little iron
        rods), which were placed perpendicularly to the geomagnetic
        field, by irradiation for periods varying from minutes to
        several hours. Those poles were mainly N magnetic and were still
        present in many specimens after several days. </p>
      <p>After short periods of irradiation, it could be shown that the
        effect was local and on the surface. After long irradiation
        periods saturation values were obtained. </p>
      <p>We also convinced ourselves by means of an amplifier and
        oscillograph that the characteristic of an induction coil with
        an iron core changed under ultraviolet irradiation. </p>
      <p>Naturally, the magnetization was also dependent upon the
        material, its surface and history to a very high degree. Further
        investigations are in progress. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Referring to the paper read by me on January 19, 1945 at the
        New York meeting of the American Physical Society, G.F. Hull
        (Ref. 1) has clearly understood that my claims are new, as he
        says "that he (Ehrenhaft) had claimed to prove that a beam of
        natural (unpolarized) light produces a rotating action on
        matter", while, as Hull states later on according to his
        textbook, "the rotating action in a beam of circularly polarized
        light is exceedingly small, and in a beam of natural light
        nothing whatever". </p>
      <p>When Lebedew (Ref. 2) and Nichols and Hull (Ref. 3) worked,
        forces only down to 10<sup>-5</sup> or 10<sup>-6</sup> dyne
        could be measured (Ref. 4). In 1909 I developed a method of
        measurement of forces exerted in single microscopic or
        submicroscopic bodies which enable the measurement of forces as
        small as 10<sup>-10</sup> dyne and applied it for the
        determination of the size and the electric charge of single
        spherical particles of well-known density (Ref. 5). This was
        next used by K. Przibram (Ref. 6) in the measurement of the
        electric charge on single droplets of mist and later by others
        on oil drops. This method, 10<sup>4</sup> times more sensitive
        than former methods, has resulted in the detection of phenomena
        concerning the interaction between radiation and matter which I
        termed ‘photophoresis’. In a concentrated beam of natural light,
        test bodies of the same size and with the same physical
        properties move simultaneously with the direction of propagation
        of the radiation (light positive) and against this direction
        (light negative). Radiometer forces of the Crookes type or
        similar effects cannot be accountable for the observed facts
        (Ref. 8, 9). </p>
      <p>The above movements can be influenced by the superposition of
        homogeneous magnetic or electric fields (magneto-photophoresis,
        electro-photophoresis). Particels irradiated by light do move in
        the homogeneous magnetic fields and reverse their direction of
        movement with the reversal of the field as often as desired. It
        must be concluded that they carry an excess of N or S magnetic
        charge. Many of the test bodies exhibiting a magnetic charge in
        the light retain this charge in the dark (Ref. 10). Thus,
        expanding the terminology of Faraday, there exists a magnetic
        ion in general and consequently a magnetic current. The electric
        action of magnetic currents, the counterpart of the magnetic
        action of electric currents has been demonstrated (Ref. 11). His
        means that the single electric charge (pole) rotates around the
        magnetic current and that the single magnetic charge (pole)
        rotates around the electric current (Oersted-Ampere). </p>
      <p>In my recent measurements of single magnetic charges on
        microscopic particles, I separated the influence of light from
        the influence of the magnetic field by measuring these charges
        in the dark (Ref. 12). I further investigated again the
        ponderomotive force of light upon matter. If one introduces and
        allows to fall into a vertically projected beam particles of,
        for instance, Cr, Fe, Mn, Cu<sup>2</sup>O, those of a size of
        about the wavelength of light and smaller fall vertically, while
        those of more than the wavelength of light in size describe in
        falling distinct helical paths in the beam of light, as already
        observed by me and my school in Vienna and Whytlaw-Gray
        (Leeds)(Ref. 8) in the horizontal beam. Whytlaw-Gray has
        repeated my experiments and obtained identical results. </p>
      <p>In my recent experiments made with Richard Whitall it was
        determined that often the bodies made five to ten revolutions
        per second around the axis of the helix, and the radius of this
        helical path is exceedingly large compared with the radius of
        the body. These facts can be easily understood. Optically active
        substances rotate the plane of polarization of light, and
        Faraday (1845) succeeded in rotating the plane of polarization
        by applying a magnetic field parallel to the beam. </p>
      <p>The helical paths have been observed with linear polarized
        light as well as with natural light, and without parallel
        external magnetic field. This is to be expected, since the light
        scattered by a spherical body is for the most part linear
        polarized, and since our magneto-photophoresis experiments
        demonstrate that in the direction of the light beam there exists
        a static longitudinal magnetic field analogous to the
        electrostatic field therein produced by Woldemar Voigt (Ref.
        13). These fields can explain in some respect electro- and
        magneto-photophoresis with the movement of electrically charged
        bodies in the longitudinal magnetic field of the beam of light.
        Concerning the helical movement in the beam of light, the
        electric charge rotates around the longitudinal magnetic field
        and vice versa. </p>
      <p>The helical movement of particles observed by me and
        Whytlaw-Gray cannot be explained by the formulation of
        Maxwell-Poynting, on which point of view G.F. Hull has based his
        work on light pressure. </p>
      <p>It has been found that light rotates matter, if matter is free
        to move with 3 degrees of freedom. The well-known principles of
        conservation of linear and angular momentum of electrodynamics
        (Poincare, Max Abraham) do not cover the experimental facts that
        light can exert forces of attraction, repulsion and torsion.
        Regarding the general theoretical conclusions it is evident that
        we have to add to the electrodynamic equations the expression
        for the true single magnetic charge and therefore the term for
        the magnetic current (Ref. 14). The formulations have to be
        broadened in such a way as to include the three actions listed
        above. </p>
      <p>These observed actions require a modification of the relation E
        = MC^2, pronounced for the first time by Hasenoehrl (1904) for
        the radiation of black bodies (Ref. 15), generalized later on,
        as well as a revision of the more modern concepts which have
        been derived from the enunciation of A. Soldner (1801), entitled
        ‘About the Deflection of a Beam of Light from its Rectilinear
        Movement through the Attraction of a Celestial Body Near Which
        the Beam Passes’ (Ref. 16). In considering astrophysical
        questions it is clear that one must take into account not only
        the repulsive force of radiation but also the attractive and
        rotational forces. </p>

      <p>In the following measurements the circular poles of an
        Ehrenhaft condenser of the diameter of 9 mm were rebuilt into
        poles of a strong electromagnet. The upper plate consists of a
        hollow cylinder of soft iron with an external diameter of 9 mm.
        and an internal diameter of 2 mm. Into this is introduced an
        electric insulated solid cylinder of the same iron with a
        diameter of 1 mm. These cylinders can be brought to various
        electric potentials. The lower plate ends in a conical iron pin,
        2 mm thick, which has a circular base with a diameter of 1 mm.
        The pin is surrounded by a mantle of brass with a diameter of 9
        mm, so that its base lies in the same plane as that of the pin.
        The described condenser plates go over into two iron cores (12
        mm thick, 190 mm long), each of which is wound with 14 layers of
        2 mm copper wire. An accumulator battery of 120volts
        cross-potential and very great capacity furnishes a quite
        constant current. The number of ampere turns per 1 cm is 1080.
        The two cores are closed by an iron yoke which is insulated from
        them by leaves of mica. In this way the plates can also be used
        as an electrical condenser. Four coolers fed with flowing water,
        two for each core, provide for a sufficient removal of the heat
        and hold the temperature constant. When the windings are
        connected with the electrical circuit, there are produced two
        opposite magnetic poles in the vertical x axis. In this way we
        get a symmetrical inhomogeneous magnetic field between the
        plates of an Ehrenhaft condenser, which are at a distance of 1.8
        mm apart. <br>

        <p>The premiere investigator into the effect of magnets to
          promote dissociation of water was Professor Ehrenhaft. This
          ties in with Stan Meyers claims of 'fractioning' water and
          Randoll Mills claims of a 'hydrino' which is based on a
          fractional hydrogen charge...kind of a SUB-isotope of
          hydrogen. </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">http://paranetinfo.com/mainbbs/space/TESLA.TXT










        </p>
        <p>Ehrenhaft discovered and reported fractional charges for
          years, in the 30's and 40's, and was ignored. See P.A.M.
          Dirac, "Development of the Physicist's Conception of Nature",
          <i>Symposium on the Development of the Physicist's Conception
            of Nature</i>, ed. Jagdish Merha, D. Reidel, Boston, 1973,
          pp. 12-14 for a presentation of some of Ehrenhaft's results.
          Within the last few years Stanford University researchers have
          also positively demonstrated the existence of "fractional
          charge." For a layman's description of their work, see "A
          Spector Haunting Physics," Science News, Vol. 119, January 31,
          1981, pp. 68-69. Indeed, Dirac in his referenced article
          points out that Millikan himself -- in his original oildrop
          experiments -- reported one measurement of fractional charge,
          but discounted it as probably due to error. </p>

        </p>
        <p>For his "impossible" experiment, Dr. Ehrenhaft employs the
          simplest of apparatus. Two shiny rods of pure Swedish iron,
          sealed in holes through opposite sides of a U-shaped tube,
          resemble a setup familiar to high-school students for breaking
          up water into hydrogen and oxygen gases by passing electricity
          through it. And that is exactly what would happen if Dr.
          Ehrenhaft attached electric wires from a battery to the rods.
          But he does no such thing. </p>
        <p>Instead, he uses the iron rods as pole pieces, or "north" and
          "south" ends, of a magnet -- either an electromagnet or a
          permanent magnet. Bubbles of gas rise through the twin columns
          of acidulated water, to be collected and analyzed. As might be
          expected, nearly all of the gas is hydrogen, liberated by a
          commonplace chemical interaction between the iron rods and the
          dilute sulfuric acid, one percent by volume, in the water. But
          the phenomenal part of the experiment is that oxygen also
          turns up, Dr. Ehrenhaft recently told the American Physical
          Society. </p>
        <p>To be specific, it is found in clearly measurable proportions
          ranging from two to 12 percent of the total volume of gases.
          When the gases obtained with a permanent magnet are separated,
          the larger proportion of oxygen is found above the north pole
          of the magnet. After rigorous precautions -- including
          short-circuiting the magnet poles with wire, so that the poles
          will be at the same electric potential -- Dr. Ehrenhaft
          concludes that there is only one place the oxygen can possibly
          come from. And that is from water decomposed with a magnet!
          Without a magnet, pure hydrogen is evolved. </p>

          <p>"SMALLER THAN ELECTRON"</p>
        </center>
        <p>New evidence that there is another world of almost infinite
          minuteness, beyond the electron which only recently replaced
          the atom as the smallest thing in the universe, was brought
          forward by Prof. Felix Ehrenhaft of Vienna University at the
          meeting of the Association of German Natural Scientists and
          Physicians. </p>
        <p>Prof. Ehrenhaft's data were obtained by means of a new and
          highly powerful apparatus for the ultramicroscopic examination
          devised by himself, which makes possible the observation of
          particles far below the limits of ordinary microscopic
          visibility, floating freely in a gaseous atmosphere in a
          magnetic field. </p>
        <p>He observed in this magnetized submicroscopic field the
          behavior of globular bits of gaseous selenium with diameters
          of only 1/250,000 of an inch. Their rate of drift, under the
          influence of the magnet, indicated that the electric charges
          they carried were less than the equivalent of one electron.
          This would indicate, according to Prof. Ehrenhaft, that the
          electron is subdivisible, and therefore, that something
          smaller than the electron exists. </p>

        </p>
        <p>Ehrenhaft was a supporter of the traditional view of matter,
          while Millikan held the view that matter was atomic in nature.
          Ehrenhaft’s experiment used colloids and ultrascopic Brownian
          motion of individual fragments of metal. He was the first to
          determine a value for the electronic charge of 1.5 x 10 <sup>-19</sup>
          C in 1909. </p>
        <p>Millikan, using his famous oil drop experiment, published an
          initial result in 1910, giving the charge on the electron a
          value of 1.3 x 10-19 C. </p>
        <p>Subsequently, Ehrenhaft showed that his results indicated
          fractions of the electronic charge of 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, and
          1/100 existed. At the time, no one was able to disprove
          Ehrenhaft’s results or substantiate them. However, by 1913,
          Millikan had perfected his oil drop experiment and had
          concluded that the electronic charge had a singular value of
          1.591 x 10<sup>-19</sup> C. </p>
        <p>Millikan’s experimental results soon gathered the support of
          the most eminent physicists of the time including Planck and
          Einstein, and the atomic view of matter prevailed. He was
          awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923 for his work on
          measuring the charge on the electron. The best current value
          for the charge on the electron is e = 1.60217733 x 10 <sup>-19</sup>
          C. </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><b>http://www.wmich.edu/ethics/ESC/cs2.html</b>
        </p>
        <p>An examination of Millikan's own papers and notebooks reveals
          that he picked and chose among his drops. That is, he
          exercised discrimination with respect to which drops he would
          include in published accounts of the value of e, leaving many
          out. Sometimes he mentioned this fact, and sometimes he did
          not. </p>
        <p>Of particular concern is the fact that in his 1913 paper,
          presenting the most complete account of his measurements of
          the charge on the electron, Millikan states &amp;quotIt is to
          be remarked that this is not a selected group of drops but
          represents all of the drops experimented upon during 60
          consecutive days." </p>
        <p>Millikan's notebook appears to contradict this assertion. Of
          189 observations during the period in question, only 140 are
          presented in the paper. </p>
        <p>Millikan's results were contested by Felix Ehrenhaft, of the
          University of Vienna, who claimed to have found
          "subelectrons." Moreover, Ehrenhaft <br>
          claimed that his finding was in fact confirmed by some of
          Millikan's own data -- droplets that Millikan had mentioned
          but discounted in his published writings. </p>
        <p>The result was a decades-long controversy, the "Battle over
          the Electron," over whether or not there existed subelectrons,
          or electrons with charges of different values. This
          controversy makes an excellent case study because we are
          fortunate, thanks to Millikan's notebooks, to be able to see
          very specifically which drops he included and which he did
          not. </p>
        <p>In retrospect, we know that Millikan was "right" and
          Ehrenhaft "wrong." Electrons, to the best of our present
          experimental and theoretical knowledge, have a specific,
          discrete charge. </p>
        <p>Those scientists and other scholars who have carefully
          reviewed this case have failed to agree on whether Millikan
          was guilty of unethical behavior or "bad science" in the
          treatment and presentation of his data.</p>
