      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p><i>1. Field of the Invention</i> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to durable and efficient
        equipment for the production of a combustible and non-pollutant
        gas from underwater arcs and method therefor and more
        particularly pertains to producing a combustible gas from the
        underwater arcing of electrodes moving with respect to each
        other. </p>
      <p><i>2. Description of the Prior Art</i> </p>
      <p>The combustible nature of the gas bubbling to the surface from
        an underwater welding arc between carbon electrodes was
        discovered and patented in the last century. Various improved
        equipment for the production of said combustible gas have been
        patented during this century. Nevertheless, the technology has
        not yet reached sufficient maturity for regular industrial and
        consumer production and sales because of numerous
        insufficiencies, including excessively short duration of the
        carbon electrodes which requires prohibitive replacement and
        service, as well as low efficiency and high content of carbon
        dioxide responsible for the green house effect. As a result of
        numerous experimentations, this invention deals with a new
        equipment for the production of a combustible gas from
        underwater arcs between carbon electrodes which resolves said
        insufficiencies, and achieves the first known maturity for
        industrial production and sales. </p>
      <p>The technology of underwater electric welding via the use of an
        arc between carbon electrodes to repair ships, was established
        in the last century. It was then discovered that the gas
        bubbling to the surface from underwater arcs is combustible. In
        fact, one of the first U.S. patent on the production of a
        combustible gas via an underwater electric arc between carbon
        electrodes dates back to 1898 (U.S. Pat. No. 603,058 by H.
        Eldridge). </p>
      <p>Subsequently, various patents were obtained in this century on
        improved equipment for the production of said combustible gas,
        among which I quote U.S. Pat. No. 5,159,900 (W. A. Dammann and
        D. Wallman, 1992); U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,274 (W. H. Richardson,
        Jr., 1995); U.S. Pat. No. 5,417,817 (W. A. Dammann and D.
        Wallman, 1995); U.S. Pat. No. 5,692,459 (W. H. Richardson, Jr.,
        1997); U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,325 (W. H. Richardson, Jr., 1998);
        and U.S. Pat. No. 5,826,548 (W. H. Richardson, Jr., 1998). </p>
      <p>The main process in these inventions is essentially the
        following. The arc is generally produced by a DC power unit,
        such as a welder, operating at low voltage (25-35 V) and high
        current (300 A to 3,000 A) depending on available Kwh. The high
        value of the current brings to incandescence the tip of the
        carbon electrode in the cathode, with consequential
        disintegration of the carbon crystal, and release of highly
        ionized carbon atoms to the arc. Jointly, the arc separates the
        water into highly ionized atoms of Hydrogen and Oxygen. This
        causes in the immediate surrounding of the arc a high
        temperature plasma of about 7,000 F, which is composed by highly
        ionized H, O and C atoms. A number of chemical reactions then
        occur within or near said plasma, such as: the formation of the
        H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecule; the burning of H and O into
        H<sub>2</sub>O; the burning of C and O into CO; the burning of
        CO and O into CO<sub>2</sub> ; and other reactions. Since all
        these reactions are highly exothermic, they result in the
        typical, very intense glow of the arc within water, which is
        bigger than that of the same arc in air. The resulting gases
        cool down in the water surrounding the discharge, and bubble to
        the surface, where they are collected with various means.
        According to numerous measurements conducted at various
        independent laboratories, the combustible gas produced with the
        above process essentially consists of 45%-48% H.sub.2, 36%-38%
        CO, 8%-10% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 1%-2% O<sub>2</sub>, the
        remaining gas consisting of parts per million of more complex
        molecules composed by H, O and C. </p>
      <p>This process produces an excellent combustible gas because the
        combustion exhausts meet all current EPA requirement without any
        catalytic muffler at all, and without the highly harmful
        cancerogenic pollutants which are contained in the combustion
        exhausts of gasoline, diesel, natural gas and other fuels of
        current use. </p>
      <p>Despite the indicated excellent combustion characteristics, and
        despite research and development conducted by inventors for
        decades, the technology of the combustible gas produced by an
        underwater arc between carbon electrodes has not reached
        industrial maturity until now, and no equipment producing said
        combustible gas for actual practical usages is currently sold to
        the public in the U.S.A. or abroad, the only equipment currently
        available for sale being limited to research and testing. The
        sole equipment currently sold for public use produce different
        gases, such as the Brown gas which is not suitable for use in
        internal combustion engines because it implodes, rather than
        explodes, during combustion. </p>
      <p>The main reason for lack of industrial and consumer maturity is
        the excessively short duration of the carbon electrodes, which
        requires prohibitive replacement and services. According to
        extensive, independently supervised, and certified measurements,
        the electrodes are typically composed of solid carbon rods of
        about 3/8 inch in diameter and about 1 foot length. Under 14 Kwh
        power input, said electrodes consume at the rate of about one
        and one quarter inch length per minute, requiring the halting of
        the operation, and replacement of the electrodes every ten
        minutes. </p>
      <p>The same tests have shown that, for 100 Kwh power input, said
        electrodes are generally constituted by solid carbon rod of
        about 1 inch diameter and of the approximate length of one foot,
        and are consumed under a continuous underwater arc at the rate
        of about 3 inch length per minute, thus requiring servicing
        after 3 to 4 minutes of operation. In either case of 14 Kwh or
        100 Kwh, current equipment requires servicing after only a few
        minutes of usage, which is unacceptable on industrial and
        consumer grounds for evident reasons, including increased risks
        of accidents for very frequent manual operations in a high
        current equipment. </p>
      <p>An additional insufficiency of existing equipment is the low
        efficiency in the production of said combustible gas, which
        efficiency is hereinafter referred to the ratio between the
        volume of combustible gas produced in cubic feet per hour (cfh)
        and the real electric power at the panel used per hour (Kwh).
        For instance extensive measurements have established that
        pre-existing equipment have the efficiency of 2-3 cfh/Kwh. Yet
        another insufficiency of existing equipment is the high content
        in said combustible gas of carbon dioxide, which is the gas
        responsible for the green house effect. In fact, prior to
        combustion said gas has a CO<sub>2</sub> content of 8%-10% with
        a corresponding content after combustion of about 15% CO<sub>2</sub>,
        thus causing evident environmental problems. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known
        types of traditional equipment for the production of combustible
        and non-pollutant gases now present in the prior art, the
        present invention provides improved durable and efficient
        equipment for the production of a combustible and non-pollutant
        gas from underwater arcs and method therefor. </p>
      <p>As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which
        will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide
        new and improved durable and efficient equipment for the
        production of a combustible and non-pollutant gas from
        underwater arcs and method therefor and method which has all the
        advantages of the prior art and none of the disadvantages. </p>
      <p>To attain this, the present invention essentially comprises a
        new and improved system for producing a clean burning
        combustible gas from an electric arc generating plasma under
        water. First provided is an electrically conductive anode
        fabricated of tungsten. The anode is solid in a generally
        cylindrical configuration with a diameter of about one inch and
        a length of about three inches. Next provided is a generally
        Z-shaped crank of a electrically conductive material. The crank
        has a linear output end supporting the anode. The crank also has
        a linear input end essentially parallel with the output end. A
        transverse connecting portion is located between the input and
        output ends. An electrically conductive cathode is next
        provided. The cathode is fabricated of carbon. The carbon is in
        a hollow tubular configuration with an axis. The cathode has a
        supported end and a free end. The cathode has a length of about
        12 inches and an internal diameter of about 11-1/2 inches and an
        external diameter of about 121/2 inches. A motor is next
        provided. The motor has a rotatable drive shaft. The drive shaft
        has a fixed axis of rotation. The motor is coupled to the input
        end of the crank and is adapted to rotate the crank to move the
        output end and anode in a circular path of travel. The circular
        path of travel has a diameter of about twelve inches with the
        anode located adjacent to the free end of the cathode. In this
        manner the anode and the arc are continuously moved around the
        cathode and away from the plasma created by the arc. Next
        provided is an axially shifted support. The support is in a
        circular configuration to receive the supported end of the
        cathode and to move the cathode axially toward the anode as the
        carbon of the cathode is consumed during operation and use. Next
        provided is a water tight container for the anode, cathode,
        crank and support. A quantity of water is provided within the
        tank sufficient to submerge the anode and the cathode. Next
        provided is an entrance port in the container. The entrance port
        functions to feed water and a carbon enriched fluid into the
        container to supplement the carbon and water lost from the
        container during operation and use. Next provided is a source of
        potential. The source of potential couples the anode and the
        cathode. In this manner an electrical arc is created between the
        anode and the cathode with a surrounding plasma for the
        production of gas within the water. The gas will then bubble
        upwardly to above the water. Last provided is an exit port for
        exhausting gas resulting from the application of current from
        the source of potential to the anode and the cathode while the
        anode is rotating and the cathode is shifting axially. </p>
      <p>There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more
        important features of the invention in order that the detailed
        description thereof that follows may be better understood and in
        order that the present contribution to the art may be better
        appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the
        invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form
        the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. </p>
      <p>In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of
        the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the
        invention is not limited in its application to the details of
        construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth
        in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The
        invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced
        and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood
        that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are for the
        purpose of descriptions and should not be regarded as limiting.
      </p>
      <p>As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the
        conception, upon which this disclosure is based, may readily be
        utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures,
        methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the
        present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims
        be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar
        as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present
        invention. </p>
      <p>It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide
        new and improved durable and efficient equipment for the
        commercial production of a combustible and non-pollutant gas
        from underwater arcs and method therefor which has all of the
        advantages of the prior art equipment for the production of
        combustible and non-pollutant gasses and none of the
        disadvantages. </p>
      <p>It is another object of the present invention to provide new
        and improved durable and efficient equipment for the production
        of a combustible and non-pollutant gas from underwater arcs and

        and marketed on a commercial basis. </p>
      <p>Lastly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
        new and improved system for producing a clean burning
        combustible gas comprising an electrically conductive first
        electrode, an electrically conductive second electrode, a motor

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 1, a typical embodiment of the
        electrodes of current use for the production of a combustible
        gas from underwater arcs is that in which one or more pairs of
        solid carbon rods are immersed within the selected liquid
        head-on along their cylindrical symmetry axis. The activation of
        the arc first requires the physical contact of the tips of the
        two rods, with consequential large surge of electricity due to
        shorting, followed by a retraction of the electrodes up to the
        arc gap, which is typically of the order of 1/16 inch depending
        on power input. The components of such embodiment include: </p>
      <p>a, b: carbon electrodes <br>
        c, d: holder of a &amp; b <br>
        e, f: screws for advancement of a &amp; b <br>
        g, h: mechanism for the advancement of a &amp; b <br>
        i: reaction chamber <br>
        j: exit of combustible gas from chamber </p>
      <p>Numerous alternatives to the above typical embodiment have been
        invented. For instance, in the U.S. Pat. No. 603,058 (H.
        Eldridge, 1898) one can see a variety of configurations of the
        electrodes, including rod shaped anodes and disk-shaped
        cathodes. As a further example also with reference to FIG. 1,
        the embodiment of U.S. Pat. No. 5,159,900 (W. A. Dammann and D.
        Wallman, 1992) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,417,817 (W. A. Dammann and D.
        Wallman, 1995), essentially consists of the preceding geometric
        configuration of the electrodes, complemented by a mechanisms
        for the inversion of polarity between the electrodes, in view of
        the fact that the cathode experiences the highest consumption
        under a DC arc, while the anode experiences a comparatively much
        reduced consumption. Even though innovative, this second
        embodiment also remains manifestly insufficient to achieve the
        duration of the electrodes needed for industrial maturity, while
        adding other insufficiencies, such as the interruption of the
        arc at each time the polarities are inverted, with consequential
        loss of time and efficiency due to the indicated electrical
        surges each time the arc is initiated. </p>
      <p>As an additional example, and with reference to FIG. 2, the
        mechanism of the U.S. Pat. No. 5,792,325 (W. H. Richardson, Jr.,
        1998), has a different preferred embodiment consisting of one or
        more pairs of electrodes in the shape of carbon disks rotating
        at a distance along their peripheral edges, in between which an
        electrically neutral carbon rod is inserted. Said rod causes the
        shorting necessary to activate the arc, and then the maintenance
        of the arc itself. This latter mechanism also does not resolve
        the main problem herein considered. In fact, the neutral carbon
        rod is consumed at essentially the same rate as that of the
        preceding embodiments. In addition, the mechanism has the
        disadvantage of breaking down the single arc between two
        cylindrical electrodes into two separate arcs, one per each the
        two couplings of the conducting disk and the neutral rod, with
        consequential reduction of efficiency due to the drop of voltage
        and other factors. Numerous means can be envisaged to improve
        the life of carbon electrodes, such as mechanisms based on
        barrel-type rapid replacements of the carbon rods. These
        mechanisms are not preferred here because the arc has to be
        reactivated every time a rod is replaced, thus requiring the
        re-establishing of the arc with physical contact, and
        consequential shortcomings indicated earlier. The components of
        such embodiment include: </p>
      <p>l, m: carbon disk electrodes <br>
        n, O: gear rotating l &amp; m <br>
        p, q: side gear for rotating n &amp; o <br>
        r, s: shaft of gears p &amp; q <br>
        t, u: mechanism for rotating shafts r &amp; s <br>
        v: electrodes neutral vertical rod <br>
        w: advancement of v <br>
        x: mechanism for advancement of v <br>
        y: reactor chamber <br>
        z: electrical power mechanism </p>
      <p>This inventor believes that the primary origin of the
        insufficiency herein considered rests with the carbon rods
        themselves, which are indeed effective for underwater welding,
        but are not adequate for the different scope of producing a
        combustible gas from underwater arcs. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 3, this invention specifically deals
        with an equipment that solves the insufficiency herein
        considered, by achieving the duration desired by the
        manufacturer, while sustaining a continuous arc without
        interruptions for the entire desired duration. For the case of
        large industrial production of said combustible gas with
        electrical energy input of the order of 100 Kwh, a
        representative equipment of this invention essentially consists
        of: </p>
      <p>1) One or more arcs produced by a DC current as typically
        available in commercially sold power units; </p>
      <p>2) One or more anodes made of solid rods of about 1 inch in
        diameter and about 2 inches in length and composed by a high
        temperature conductor, such as Tungsten or ceramic. Extensive
        and diversified experimentations have established that the
        consumption of said anode composed by ordinary Tungsten is
        minimal, and definitely of the order of several weeks of
        operation. </p>
      <p>3) One or more carbon-based cathodes in the configuration of a
        large hollow rod geometrically defined as a cylinder with the
        same thickness of the anode, but with a radius and length
        selected to provide the desired duration. This cathode performs
        the vital function of becoming incandescent in the immediate
        vicinity of the arc, thus releasing carbon to the plasma. </p>
      <p>With greater specificity and with reference to FIGS. 3 and 4,
        the present invention essentially comprises a new and improved
        system 10 for producing a clean burning combustible gas from an
        electric arc generating plasma under water. First provided is an
        electrically conductive anode 12 fabricated of tungsten. The
        anode is solid in a generally cylindrical configuration with a
        diameter of about one inch and a length of about three inches. </p>
      <p>Next provided is a generally Z-shaped crank 14 of a
        electrically conductive material. The crank has a linear output
        end 16 supporting the anode. The crank also has a linear input
        end 18 essentially parallel with the output end. A transverse
        connecting portion 20 is located between the input and output
        ends. </p>
      <p>An electrically conductive cathode 22 is next provided. The
        cathode is fabricated of carbon. The carbon is in a hollow
        tubular configuration with an axis. The cathode has a supported
        end 24 and a free end 26. The cathode has a length of about 12
        inches and an internal diameter of about 111/2 inches and an
        external diameter of about 121/2 inches. </p>
      <p>A motor 28 is next provided. The motor has a rotatable drive
        shaft 30. The drive shaft has a fixed axis of rotation. The
        motor is coupled to the input end of the crank and is adapted to
        rotate the crank to move the output end and anode in a circular
        path of travel. The circular path of travel has a diameter of
        about twelve inches with the anode located adjacent to the free
        end of the cathode. In this manner the anode and the arc are
        continuously moved around the cathode and away from the plasma
        created by the arc. </p>
      <p>Next provided is an axially shifted support 32. The support is
        in a circular configuration to receive the supported end of the
        cathode and to move the cathode axially toward the anode as the
        carbon of the cathode is consumed during operation and use. </p>
      <p>A water tight container 34 for the anode, cathode, crank and
        support is next provided. A quantity of water 36 is provided
        within the tank sufficient to submerge the anode and the
        cathode. </p>
      <p>An entrance port 38 is provided in the container. The entrance
        port functions to feed water and a carbon enriched fluid into
        the container to supplement the carbon and water lost from the
        container during operation and use. </p>
      <p>Next provided is a source of potential 42. The source of
        potential couples the anode and the cathode. In this manner an
        electrical arc is created between the anode and the cathode with
        a surrounding plasma for the production of gas within the water.
        The gas will then bubble upwardly to above the water. </p>
      <p>Lastly provided is an exit port 44 for exhausting gas resulting
        from the application of current from the source of potential to
        the anode and the cathode while the anode is rotating and the
        cathode is shifting axially. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 4--4 of FIG.
        3, but is directed to an alternate embodiment. In such
        embodiment, the anode 48 is wing shaped to cause less turbulence
        in the water when moving. In addition, various supports 50 are
        provided for abating turbulence and for providing rigidity. </p>
      <p>Again with reference to FIG. 3, the anode rod is placed head-on
        on the edge of the cylindrical cathode and is permitted to
        rotate around the entire periphery of said cylindrical edge via
        an electric motor or other means. The inverse case of the
        rotation of the cathode cylinder on a fixed anode rod or the
        simultaneous rotation of both, are equally acceptable, although
        more expensive for engineering and production. Extensive tests
        have established that, under a sufficient rotational speed of
        the anode rod on the cylindrical cathode of the order of 100
        r.p.m. or thereabout, the consumption of the edge of the cathode
        tube is uniform, thus permitting the desired continuous
        underwater arc without the interruptions necessary for the
        frequent cathode rod replacements in the pre-existing
        configurations. </p>
      <p>For the case of smaller electrical power input the above
        equipment remains essentially the same, except for the reduction
        of the diameter of the non-carbon based anode and of the
        corresponding thickness of the carbon-based cylindrical cathode.
        For instance, for 14 Kwh power input, said anode diameter and
        related thickness of the cylindrical cathode can be reduced to
        about 3/8 inch. </p>
      <p>The above new equipment does indeed permit the achievement of
        the desired duration of the electrodes prior to servicing. As a
        first illustration for industrial usage, suppose that the
        manufacturer desires an equipment for the high volume industrial
        production of said combustible gas from about 100 Kwh energy
        input with the duration of four hours, thus requiring the
        servicing twice a day, once for lunch break and the other at the
        end of the working day, as compared to the servicing only after
        a few minutes of use for the pre-existing equipment. </p>
      <p>This invention readily permits the achievement of said duration
        under said power input. Recall that carbon rods of about 1o in
        diameter are consumed by the underwater arc from 100 Kwh at the
        speed of about 3 inches in length per minute. Numerous
        experimentations have established that a cylindrical carbon
        cathode of 1o thickness, approximately one foot radius and
        approximately two feet length permits the achievement of the
        desired duration of 4 hours of continuous use prior to service.
        In fact, such a geometry implies that each 1 inch section of the
        cylindrical cathode is consumed in 6 minutes. Since 4 hours
        correspond to 240 minutes, the duration of four hours of
        continuous use requires forty 1 inch sections of the cylindrical
        cathode. Then, the desired 4 hours duration of said cathode
        requires the radius R=40/3.14=12.7 inches, as indicated. It is
        evident that a cylindrical carbon cathode of about two feet in
        radius and about one foot in length has essentially the same
        duration as the preceding configuration of one foot radius and
        two feet length. As a second example for consumer units with
        smaller power input than the above, the same duration of 4 hours
        prior to servicing can be reached with proportionately smaller
        dimensions of said electrodes which can be easily computed via
        the above calculations. </p>
      <p>It is important to show that the same equipment described above
        also permits the increase of the efficiency as defined earlier.
        In-depth studies conducted by this inventor at the particle,
        atomic and molecular levels here, omitted for brevity, have
        established that the arc is very efficient in decomposing water
        molecules into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The low efficiency in
        the production of a combustible gas under the additional
        presence of carbon as in pre-existing patents is due to the fact
        that, when said H and O gases are formed in the plasma
        surrounding the discharge, most of these gases burn, by
        returning to form again water molecules. In turn, the loss due
        to re-creation of water molecules is the evident main reason for
        the low efficiency of pre-existing equipment. The very reason
        for said poor efficiency is the stationary nature of the arc
        itself within the plasma, because under these conditions the arc
        triggers the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen originally
        created from the separation of the water. </p>
      <p>The above described new equipment of this invention also
        improves the efficiency. In fact, said efficiency can be
        improved by removing the arc from the plasma immediately after
        its formation. In turn, an effective way for achieving such an
        objective without extinguishing the arc itself is to keep the
        liquid and plasma in stationary conditions, and rapidly move
        instead the arc away from the plasma. This function is precisely
        fulfilled by the new equipment of this invention because the arc
        continuously rotates, by therefore exiting the plasma
        immediately after its formation. Extensive experimentations
        conducted have established that the new equipment of this
        invention can increase the efficiency from the 2-3 cf per Kwh of
        current embodiments to 4-6 cf per Kwh. </p>
      <p>It is easy to see that the same equipment of this invention
        also decreases the content of carbon dioxide. In fact, CO.sub.2
        is formed by burning CO and O, thus originating from a secondary
        chemical reaction in the arc plasma following the creation of
        CO. But the latter reaction is triggered precisely by the
        stationary arc within the plasma. Therefore, the removal of the
        arc from the plasma after its formation via the fast rotation of
        the anode on the cylindrical edge of the cathode while the
        liquid is stationary implies a decrease of CO.sub.2 content
        because of the decrease of the ignition of CO and O. Extensive
        experimentation has established that a rotation of 100 r.p.m of
        the anode over the edge of the cylindrical cathode of radius one
        foot decreases the content of carbon dioxide in the combustible
        gas at least by half, thus permitting a significant
        environmental advance. The decrease of the CO.sub.2 content also
        implies an increase of the efficiency alternatively defined as
        energy content of the gas produced per hour (BTUh) divided by
        the real electric energy absorbed per hour (Kwh). In fact,
        CO.sub.2 is a non-combustible gas, thus having no meaningful BTU
        content. It is then evident that, since the total carbon content
        in the gas remains the same, the decrease of the non-combustible
        CO.sub.2 is replaced in the gas by a corresponding increase of
        the combustible CO with the same carbon content, thus increasing
        the energy content of the gas for the same production volume of
        pre-existing inventions and for the same real power absorbed. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 3, among various possible alternatives,
        a preferred embodiment of this invention for the high volume
        industrial production of a combustible gas from underwater arcs
        with about 100 Kwh real electrical energy essentially comprises:
      </p>
      <p>A) An enclosed reactor chamber of the approximate dimensions 4
        feet high, 3 feet wide and 3 feet long fabricated out of steel
        sheets or other metal of about 1/4 inch thickness, comprising in
        its interior the electrodes for the creation of the arc serviced
        by said power input and having means for the exiting of the gas
        produced in its interior as well as means for the rapid access
        or servicing 56 of the internal electrodes for services; </p>
      <p>B) The filling up of said chamber with a liquid generally
        consisting of water and/or water saturated with carbon rich
        water soluble substances; </p>
      <p>C) One or more anodes consisting of rods of about 1 inch
        diameter and about 2 inches length made of Tungsten or other
        temperature resistant conductor; </p>
      <p>D) One or more cylindrical shaped carbon cathodes with
        essentially the same thickness as that of the anodes and with
        radius and length selected for the desired duration; </p>
      <p>E) Electromechanical means for the rotation of the anode rod
        head-wise on the edge of the cylindrical cathode, or the
        rotation of the edge of the cylindrical cathode on a stationary
        anode rod, or the simultaneous rotation of both; </p>
      <p>F) Automation for the initiation of the arc and its maintenance
        via the automatic advancement of the carbon cathode, and/or the
        anode rod and/or both, in such a way to maintain constant the
        arc gap 58. </p>
      <p>G) Fastenings of said cylindrical carbon cathode such to permit
        its rapid replacement; various gauges for the remote monitoring
        of the power unit, combustible gas, liquid and electrodes; tank
        for the storage of the gas produced and miscellaneous other
        items. </p>
      <p>An improved version of the above embodiment is conceived to
        minimize the rotation of said liquid because of drag due to the
        submerged rotation of the anode, with consequential return to
        the stationary character of the plasma 54 and the arc,
        consequential loss of efficiency and increase of CO.sub.2
        content for the reasons indicated above. </p>
      <p>With reference to FIG. 4, and among a variety of embodiments,
        this objective can be achieved by shaping the rotating anode in
        the form of a wing with minimal possible drag resistance while
        rotating within said liquid, and by inserting in the interior of
        the enclosed reactor chamber panels fabricated out of metal or
        other strong material with the approximate thickness of 1/8
        inch, said panels being placed not in contact with yet close to
        the cathode and the anode in a radially distributed with respect
        to the cylindrical symmetry axis of the equipment and placed
        both inside as well as outside said cylindrical cathode. The
        latter panels perform the evident function of minimizing the
        rotational motion of said liquid due to drag created by the
        submerged rotation of the anode. </p>
      <p>The remote operation of the equipment is essentially as
        follows: </p>
      <p>1) The equipment is switched on with electric current
        automatically set at minimum, the anode rod automatically
        initiating its rotation on the edge of the cylindrical cathode,
        and the arc being open; </p>
      <p>2) The automation decreases the distance between anode and
        cathode until the arc is initiated, while the amps are released
        automatically to the desired value per each given Kwh, and the
        gap distance is automatically kept to the optimal value of the
        selected liquid and Kwh via mechanical and/or optical and/or
        electrical sensors; </p>
      <p>3) The above equipment produces the combustible gas under
        pressure inside the metal vessel, which is then transferred to
        the storage tank via pressure difference or a pump; production
        of said combustible gas then continues automatically until the
        complete consumption of said cylindrical carbon cathode </p>
      <p>As to the manner of usage and operation of the present
        invention, the same should be apparent from the above
        description. Accordingly, no further discussion relating to the
        manner of usage and operation will be provided. </p>
      <p>With respect to the above description then, it is to be
        realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the
        parts of the invention, to include variations in size,
        materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation,
        assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one
        skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those
        illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification
        are intended to be encompassed by the present invention. </p>
      <p>Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of
        the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous
        modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in
        the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact
        construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly,
        all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to,
        falling within the scope of the invention. </p>
