      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention is dramatically more efficient than those
        disclosed in prior art, such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 603,058 to H.
        Eldridge; 5,159,900 to W. A. Dammann and D. Wallman; 5,435,274
        to W. H. Richardson, Jr.; 5,417,817 to W. A. Dammann and D.
        Wailman; 5,692,459 to W. H. Richardson, Jr.; 5,792,325 to W. H.
        Richardson, Jr. </p>
      <p>The processes as per the latter prior art patents have the
        following main drawbacks which have prevented their being
        suitable for industrial and consumer applications: 1) the gas
        produced is environmentally unacceptable, because, according to
        numerous measurements, its exhaust contains 4% to 8% more carbon
        dioxide than fossil fuel exhaust; and 2) the gas produced is
        industrially unacceptable, because, also according to various
        measurements, its production rate is excessively slow due to the
        burning by the arc of the hydrogen and oxygen back to water, as
        illustrated by the typical large glow of underwater arcs. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention includes: a new process for flowing the liquid
        waste through electric arcs; equipment and process for the total
        recycling of liquid waste which cannot be even partially
        disposed in the environment, into a usable clean burning gas, a
        usable large source of heat, and solid precipitates usable for
        industrial applications; equipment and process for recycling
        biologically contaminated liquid waste, such as town, municipal,
        farm, industrial or consumer sewage, for the production of
        usable combustible gas, nutrient rich water usable for
        irrigation, and solid precipitates usable as fertilizers. </p>
      <p>Car dealers, automotive service stations, municipalities,
        industries, farms, and any other entity releasing liquid waste
        are turned by this invention into a producer of clean fuel via
        an equipment which has essentially the dimension of a desk. </p>
      <p>Water is known to be one of the best electric insulators. Yet,
        under an electric arc, the resistance of water collapses to
        values of the order of fractional Ohms, which low value of the
        resistance further decrease with the increase of the Kwh. It is
        evident that, under these conditions, the electric arc within
        water is one of the best known superconducting conditions at
        high temperature. </p>
      <p>In fact, the flow of the liquid waste to be recycled through
        the electric arc, pushes a plasma created by the energized arc
        away from the arc on a continuous basis. Following the
        displacement of said plasma from the immediate vicinity of the
        electrodes tips, estimated to be a displacement of the order of
        1/8", the plasma instantly cools down because the surrounding
        liquid is relatively very cold, implying a transition from 7,000
        degrees F. to about 200 degrees F. </p>
      <p>The present invention provides equipment and processes for
        producing a clean burning combustible gas and further provides
        heat energy from the large amount of heat acquired by the
        liquid, which can be captured and utilized with heat exchangers,
        radiators and other means known in the art. </p>
      <p>For the case of the separation of the water via the
        PlasmaArcFlow Reactor with carbon anode, the cooled down plasma
        is formed by atoms of hydrogen, oxygen and carbon. Due to the
        much bigger affinity of carbon and oxygen, as compared to those
        of hydrogen and oxygen or hydrogen and carbon, the carbon
        instantly removes all available oxygen by forming the
        combustible gas CO. The PlasmaArcFlow then prevents CO to be
        oxidized by the electric arc into CO<sub>2</sub>. When the
        impurity in the water and in the carbon rod is ignorable, and
        under the maximal possible use of the PlasmaArcFlow, the
        resulting combustible gas is composed of a mixture essentially
        50% of H2 and 50% CO, by volume. For the total recycling of
        liquid waste of fossil fuel origin, such as automotive
        antifreeze and oil waste, the principal constituents of the
        produced combustible gas remain H<sub>2</sub> and CO, although
        in different proportions, such as 40% H<sub>2</sub>, 50% CO, 5%
        O<sub>2</sub> and the remaining components being inert gases.
        Alternatively, the principal constituents of the produced
        combustible gas are about 40% H<sub>2</sub>, about 55% CO, about
        3% CO<sub>2</sub>, and about 2% O<sub>2</sub>. </p>
      <p>The combustion exhaust of the produced combustible gas from
        pure water composed 50% of H2 and 50% CO is therefore made of
        water vapor in approximately 60%, 20% carbon in solid form, 4%
        to 6% CO<sub>2</sub>, the balance being given by atmospheric
        gases, including nitrogen and possible impurities. In this way,
        the exhaust has no carcinogenic or other toxic substances,
        contains from 1/2 to 1/3 the CO<sub>2</sub> of fossil fuel
        exhaust, and the oxygen consumption is dramatically less than
        the alarming oxygen depletion caused by the combustion of fossil
        fuels, currently running at the equivalent of about 72 million
        of oil barrels per day. </p>
      <p>The exhaust of the combustible gas produced by the recycling of
        contaminated liquid waste is considerably better than that from
        the separation of the water, due to the larger O<sub>2</sub>
        content. In fact, the exhaust is given by about 50% water vapor,
        20% carbon in solid form, 15% oxygen, 4% to 6% CO<sub>2</sub>,
        and the rest is given by atmospheric gases. Alternatively, the
        exhaust can be about 60% water vapor, about 15% oxygen, about
        15% carbon in solid form, about 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and the rest,
        being general atmospheric gases. </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the combustible gas produced by the invention
        herein is an environmentally best available fuel, which can be
        used in any application currently served by fossil fuels,
        including metal cutting, heating, cooking, automotive and truck
        uses. </p>
      <p>As also indicated earlier, the heat produced by the inventive
        apparatus and process is acquired by the liquid waste during its
        recirculating flow through the electric arc, and can be utilized
        by separately flowing said liquid waste in an outside radiator,
        heat exchanger, or other conventional utilization of heat. For
        this reason, apparatus according to this invention generally
        have two different and independent recirculating systems
        individually served by pumps, one for the flowing of the liquid
        waste through the electric arc, and a separate one for the
        flowing of the same liquid waste through an outside heat
        utilization system. </p>
      <p>Extensive experimentation and tests have established that the
        inventive systems are more effective operationally when the
        liquid waste is hot as compared to the same operation when the
        liquid waste is kept cold. Therefore, the system is operated at
        a minimal temperature of the liquid waste which depends on the
        desired application. </p>
      <p>When operating at atmospheric pressure, the present invention
        for the total recycling of liquid waste is run at a constant
        liquid waste temperature of about 180 degrees F., while all heat
        in excess of that temperature is utilized with said external
        systems. In this case, the inventive system can be used as
        heaters of rooms or of buildings either via radiators with fans
        directly connected to the reactors as indicated above, or via
        the use of the equipment to heat up water via heat exchangers
        which hot water is then pumped through conventional heaters in
        individual rooms. </p>
      <p>This invention can also be used to produce steam. This
        application is achieved by operating the system at pressures of
        15 to 20 psi for the recycling of liquid waste such as
        automotive antifreeze or oil waste, in which case said liquid
        waste can be kept at the minimal temperature of 400 degrees F.
        without boiling, while dissipating via a heat exchanger all heat
        in excess of said temperature. Since, under the above
        conditions, the heat exchanger operates at a temperature bigger
        than the boiling temperature of water, the system can indeed
        produce steam in a continuous basis. </p>
      <p>When the system is operated at atmospheric level, the
        production of the combustible gas is almost explosive since we
        have the conversion of one unit of volume of the liquid into
        about 1,800 units of volume of the gas, as per established
        knowledge in the transition of state from liquids to gas. It
        then follows that the production of the gas displaces the
        liquids, and the arc occurs for about 60% of the time within the
        gas, rather than within the liquid. </p>
      <p>The increase of the pressure in the vessel implies the
        corresponding proportional decrease of the size of the bubbles
        of the gas produced, with corresponding increase of the period
        of time the arc occurs within the liquid. As illustrations, the
        operation of the equipment at 20 psi implies the decrease of the
        size of the gas bubbles of at least one tenth, while an
        operating pressure of 200 psi is expected to imply a reduction
        of the gas bubbles of the order of 1/100th. </p>
      <p>The volume of gas produced is directly proportional to the gap
        between the electrodes. Unlike the case of electric arcs in air,
        the gap of electric arcs within liquids can be appreciably
        increased only with the increase of the Kwh. </p>
      <p>Further, an operator can increase the flow of the liquid
        through the arc. In fact, the faster the flow of the liquid
        through the arc, the bigger the volume of the combustible gas
        produced. Also, the large glow of underwater arcs originates
        from the burning of hydrogen and oxygen back to water
        immediately following their creation, as triggered by the arc
        itself. For the case of stationary arcs within water according
        to the prior art patents quoted earlier, about 80% of the gases
        produced by the arcs burn back to water. The present invention
        reduces such a waste </p>
      <p>It should be stressed that, for a number of technical or
        practical limitations, it is impossible to utilize with current
        technology all the energies produced by electric arcs within
        liquids. The first limitation is the impossibility to utilize
        all the gases produced by said under liquid arcs, because the
        increases of the flow beyond a threshold value for each given
        electric energy extinguishes the arc itself. Additional
        limitations are due to the known impossibility to increase the
        electrodes gap for a given value of the electric energy, the
        lack of availability of conductors practically usable as
        electrodes for very large electric energies, and other factors.
      </p>
      <p>The systems or apparatus described above have been built by
        this inventor according to the specifications further described
        below, which are completely automatic, including the automatic
        initiation, control and optimization of the electric arc, and
        the automatic reloading of the consumable carbon rods.
        Particular care has been devoted to the conception and
        construction of systems to minimize waste of electric energy
        when propagating in electrodes of low conductivity, such as
        carbon electrodes. This can be achieved via copper cables of
        large current capacity delivering the electric current to copper
        bushing sliding under pressure on the carbon rods at a position
        as near as practically possible to the electric arc. </p>
      <p>In summary, this invention establishes the achievement with
        current technology of a system served by 300 Kwh, operating at
        200 psi, with a PlasmaArcFlow of about 3000 g/h, and the
        recycling of liquid waste of fossil origin kept at the constant
        temperature of 400 degrees F. via a heat exchanger.
        Alternatively, the invention provides new means for the
        production of steam. In turn, the availability of steam permits
        revolutionary new applications, such as the production of
        electric energy via steam-driven conventional electric
        generators, or the desalting of sea water via conventional
        evaporating means. </p>
      <p>Additional novel applications are the following. First, the
        invention is particularly suited to produce a clean burning
        combustible fuel from crude oil in a way which is
        environmentally, logistically, and financially more advantageous
        than currently used refineries. The environmental advantages are
        evident from the preceding analysis. The logistic advantages are
        also evident because, refineries notoriously require large area,
        thus requiring the oil to be shipped to them, while the present
        invention is light and mobile, and can therefore be shipped
        directly to the oil well. </p>
      <p>Yet another important application is the use of sea water as
        liquid to be processed within the equipment. In this case the
        gas produced has high energy content due to the various elements
        in the sea water, and the heat acquired by the liquid is
        consequently high. The invention working on sea water can then
        be used for a variety of.applications, including a new method of
        desalting sea water via steam obtained through heat exchanges. </p>
      <p>Another application of the above invention is in the recycling
        of dense liquid waste of animal origin. In fact, the liquid
        waste can be recirculated through the electric arc until all
        bacteria are eliminated, as well as until that point in which
        all bacteriological contaminants are based, thus no longer in
        solution in the water, at which point the contaminants can be
        removed with a centrifuge or a filter. This application produces
        an excellent, clean burning combustible fuel, heat acquired by
        the liquid waste, solid precipitates usable for fertilizers, and
        residual water good for irrigation. </p>
      <p>Still another application of the invention is that for the
        complete recycling of paints, paints residues, heavy industrial
        waste, and other wastes. </p>
      <p>The above description refers to total recyclers, that is,
        equipment for the complete recycling of liquid waste which
        cannot be disposed in the environment not even in part. </p>
      <p>A second class of recyclers permitted by this invention is that
        for the partial recycling of liquid waste, that is, the removal
        of contaminants for the production of a usable final liquid. A
        representative application among several possible ones is that
        for the recycling of biologically contaminated waters, such as
        city, town, farms, industrial or consumer sewage, into: 1) clean
        burning gas; 2) solid precipitates useful for fertilizers; and
        3) nutrients rich water usable for irrigation. The latter
        systems are also called linear recyclers, to denote the single
        passage of the liquid waste though the arc without
        recirculation. </p>
      <p>The main aspects of this new recycling process is the
        following. Thanks to the use of a venturi as per FIG. 1B which
        is further described below, the sewage is forced to pass through
        the immediate vicinity of the incandescent electrode tips, thus
        being exposed to a temperature of about 7,000 degrees F., the
        extremely intense light of the electric arc; electric current of
        1,000 A and more, the very strong electric and magnetic fields
        associated to said electric current, and other factors. These
        combined conditions eliminate any bacteria in the original
        sewage by therefore rendering the liquid sterile. Jointly, the
        original organic substances are partially decomposed into
        volatile and solid substances, and partially baked into sterile,
        nutrient rich substances in solution or suspension in the water.
        The degree of purity of the final water suitable for irrigation
        is then turned into technical features suitable to meet the
        requirement by environmental regulatory agencies, including
        appropriate filtering, if requested. </p>
      <p>It should he stressed that, as far as farmers are concerned,
        there is the clear need of reducing filtration at an absolute
        minimum, evidently upon achieving complete sterilization of the
        original biological contaminants. In fact, the elimination of
        nutrient rich substances produced by the linear reactor implies
        the requirement that farmers have to purchase instead chemical
        fertilizers, which are environmentally much less desirable,
        besides being more expensive. At any rate, an important
        advantage of the sewage recycling by this invention is that the
        nutrient rich waters suitable for irrigation qualify for organic
        produce, thus permitting crops of higher quality, since the
        original biocontaminants are of human or animal origin. </p>
      <p>Extensive tests and experimentation, as well as chemical
        analyses conducted by independent laboratories, have established
        the capability by a linear reactor powered by 50 Kwh to render
        sterile liquid sewage with about 5% biological contaminants at
        the rate of about 1,000 g/h. A complete recycling station
        contemplates the use of a minimum of three reactors put in
        series with individual bypasses, so as to permit the servicing
        of one station while the other two are operational. In this way,
        the linear recycler has one primary reactor for the
        sterilization of the biological contaminants, plus one second
        identical station as a safety backup, the third station being
        useful to further refine the final irrigation water. </p>
      <p>In the event that more than 1,000 g/h are needed, the above
        described three linear reactors can be put in parallel in any
        desired numbers. The increase of the electric power over 50 Kwh
        also permits an increase of the flow of recycled sewage. In this
        way, this invention permits the recycling of small flow of
        sewage of the order of 1,000 g/h or very large flow of the order
        of 1,000,000 g/h via a suitable combination of linear reactors
        in series, for the desired quality of the final irrigation
        water, as well as in parallel, for the desired flow of
        recycling, under an electric power per station which can be
        computed depending on the desired flow. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the biological contaminants present in
        city sewage generally are of the order of 5%, as indicated
        above. Very heavy sewage as available in farms can also be
        recycled with the technology of this invention in a two-fold
        way. First, by processing them without dilution in the total
        recyclers of <b>FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 2E, 3, and 4</b>,
        that is, by recirculating them until all biological contaminants
        are recycled and the liquid is sterilized. Second, the same
        dense liquid sewage can be recycled with the linear reactor of <b>FIG.





          5</b> following dilution of their concentration with tap
        water, and/or increase of electric power delivered to the arc
        proportionate to the increase of the contaminants percentage. </p>
