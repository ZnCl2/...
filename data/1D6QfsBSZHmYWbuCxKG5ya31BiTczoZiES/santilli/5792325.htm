      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>Electric arc material-processing system wherein an underwater
        spark gap is defined in a reactor by spaced graphite electrodes
        and a conductive carbon rod provided endwise to the gap. The
        electrodes are rotated by mechanical means, intermittently or
        continuously. Carbon and water are thereby converted into fuel
        gas, evolving from the arc, and comprising hydrogen as the major
        constituent and carbon monoxide as predominant minor
        constituent. Both the fuel and its combustion products are
        substantially free from contaminants found customarily in
        petroleum-based fuels and their combustion products. Surplus
        heat enables water from any source to be rendered potable. </p>

      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>This invention relates to electric arc apparatus, especially as
        useful under water, where a consumable solid material is
        introduced into the arc, as in cylindrical form. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Various electrode arrangements are shown in U.S. patents for
        processing materials in electric arc or plasma conditions, such
        as rod and disc in U.S. Pat. No. 603,058; adjustably spaced
        in-line electrodes in U.S. Pat. No. 5,159,900; coaxial in U.S.
        Pat. Nos. 5,298,714 and 5,399,829; and hollow in-line in U.S.
        Pat. No. 5,296,672. Flow directions and/or rotating magnetic
        fields may confine the arc, such as in the latter patent. </p>
      <p>In an underwater electric arc welding, wherein solid consumable
        material is introduced--whether as an electrode or otherwise--it
        is preferable to control consumption of it and of electrode
        material generally, even where consumption of such material is
        intentional. </p>
      <p>Underwater evolution of fuel by electric arcing imposes its own
        requirements upon electrode arrangements, especially as
        consumption of graphite electrodes is involved in arc processing
        of carbon rods. The present invention is directed toward
        controlling interrelation of consumable carbon rods provided to
        such electrodes, themselves also consumable, and with the
        desired effects upon all of them. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>A primary object of the present invention is to improve the
        evolution of fuel from underwater carbon arcing. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to assure even consumption
        of carbon rods introduced into an underwater arc. </p>
      <p>A further object of the invention is to assure even consumption
        of underwater arcing graphite electrodes. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of this invention is to improve production
        of gaseous fuel made from carbon and water by underwater arcing.
      </p>
      <p>A still further object is to achieve the foregoing objects with
        minimal expenditure of effort and expense. </p>
      <p>In general, the objects of the present invention are attained,
        in a reactor containing underwater electric arcing apparatus, by
        means of graphite electrodes spaced apart by a given distance at
        the nearest approach of their respective edges, making up a
        spark gap. </p>
      <p>More particularly, the electrodes are substantially disklike
        and are mounted relative to one another so their respective
        nearest edges at the given spark gap are movable in opposite
        directions. </p>
      <p>Further, conductive rods of carbon composition are introduced
        successive into the gap, each to be rotated about its own axis
        by contact of its end with the oppositely moving electrode
        edges. Such contact will usually prove intermittent under AC
        energization of the electrodes, and more nearly continuous with
        DC energization thereof </p>
      <p>Other objects of this invention, together with methods and
        means for attaining the various objects, will become apparent
        from the following description and the accompanying diagrams of
        at least one embodiment, presented by way of example rather than
        limitation. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows schematically, in side elevation, fuel
        manufacturing plant 10, viewable as three main areas: production
        at the right center, collection/storage at the left, and
        temperature control and distillation area at the far right--from
        a viewer's point of view. </p>
      <p>Prominent in the FIG. 1 production area are reactor assembly 11
        (partly cut away or sectioned to reveal its interior) and
        electrical supply equipment 8 upright on the floor alongside it.
        Reactor bed 3 slopes down to its center, which is provided with
        drain outlet 5 and with sludge pump 6 connected by sludge line 7
        to collection can 7'. Horizontal baffle 9 well above the bed
        supports electrode assembly 20 immersed in water (not shown
        here) nearly filling the reactor. Hood 30 overlies the
        electrodes and extends thereabove to collect fuel gas evolved
        from the water (not indicated here) in the reactor. </p>
      <p>At the mid-left in FIG. 1, stairway 45 leads from the floor up
        and over to magazine 40, loadable from time to time with
        consumable carbon rods (not shown here) to be fed downward via
        discharge tube 44 and out endwise between the respective
        electrodes of assembly 20. At the left of the reactor,
        collection line 31 leads from hood 30 to segregation tank 32,
        which prevents entrained water and particulates from
        contaminating the collected fuel. Line 33 leads therefrom to
        compressor 34, which forwards the collected gas to storage tank
        38, having underneath it valved gas outlet 39, available for
        connection to transportable tanks--or intervening pipeline--to
        user locations. </p>
      <p>At the right in FIG. 1, heat pump assembly 50 connects loop 51
        in the reactor to larger loop 55 in tank 60 filled with water.
        Hood 61 overlying that tank has exhaust line 63 leading from it
        to to evacuation compressor 64 mounted on bracket 54 attached to
        the tank and actuated by temperature sensor 62 in the top of the
        tank. The compressor discharges into hot air/steam line 65
        connected to line 66 down to condenser 57 with drain tap 59
        below at the far right. </p>
      <p>Operation of the components shown and described in FIG. 1 is
        deferred until after a more detailed showing and description of
        the representative electrode assembly embodiments of this
        invention. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 2A, 2B, 2C show first electrode assembly embodiment 20,
        from the side, end, and top, respectively. As shown most fully
        in FIG. 2A, twin stands 21, 29 rise upright from baffle 59, to
        support axles 22, 28 in bearings (not shown) in the horizontal
        tops of the stands. Disk-like electrodes 24, 26 retained on
        enlarged holders 23, 27 on the tops of the axles form gap 25 at
        the closest approach to each other. The peripheral edges of the
        disks are tapered so that their top the perimeter is less than
        their bottom perimeter. Intruding, from above, down into the gap
        and into contact with edges of both electrodes is rod end 41
        (also shown tapered here) emerging from discharge tube 44 of
        magazine 40 (hidden here). The axles also carry at their lower
        ends, within the respective stands, respective pinion gears 12
        and 18 engaged by drive gears 2 and 7, carried on respective
        bracket-supported bearings (8 shown here for gear 28) for
        aligned shafts 15 and 17 interconnected by swivel 16. The shafts
        interconnect via universal joint 14 to shaft 13 and are
        rotatable by turning manual rotary crank handle 11 (top left). </p>
      <p>FIGS. 3A and 3B show another electrode assembly embodiment 70,
        from the side and top, which differs from the previous
        embodiment mainly by having the disklike electrodes mounted on
        (and rotatable about) a horizontal axis in place of the previous
        vertical axes, and substituting a motor drive for the previous
        manual rotation. Thus, is twin angle brackets 71, 79 rise
        upright from baffle 59 to which they are bolted, to support
        axles 73, 77 in bearings (not shown) in the vertical parts of
        the stands. Pair of disklike electrodes 74, 76 are mounted on
        those horizontal axle shafts of waterproofed gear-drive motors
        72, 78, with gap 75 at their closest approach to each other. The
        tip of rod 81 protrudes from the bottom end of discharge tube 84
        and intrudes from above into the gap and into contact with edges
        of both electrodes. Winglike flanges 82, 88, retained against
        the angle brackets, are slip-ring plates connected to the power
        supply, which extend over axles 73, 77 to protect them from the
        arc. </p>
      <p>The operation of the apparatus of this invention is understood
        readily, as summarized below, in view of the foregoing
        description and the accompanying diagrams. Reference numerals
        are omitted here. </p>
      <p>The electrode disks are assembled to their respective axles and
        the reactor is filled with enough water to submerge the
        electrodes. With AC or DC energizing electricity in the range of
        about 50 v. to 100 v. applied to the electrodes,the first
        conductive rod is lowered toward the gap between the pair of
        electrodes, and when the rod tip gets close enough an arc
        bridges the electrodes. Bubbles evolve from the arc and rise to
        the surface of the water. The gaseous contents of the bubbles
        collect under the hood and are pumped from there through a
        segregation tank to a large tank for storage under a pressure up
        to several thousand p.s.i. or a couple hundred kg/cm.sup.2. </p>
      <p>The water in the reactor tends to get progressively hotter but
        is kept relatively cool, preferably about 140.degree. F.
        (60.degree. C.) by heat-exchange in the temperature-control
        system, enabling the generation of steam for whatever use and
        the condensation of potable water from the steam whether formed
        from brackish, polluted, or even sea water. </p>
      <p>Both the conductive rod and the electrodes are consumed bit by
        bit by the electric arc, as is the water, whose level is
        maintained above the arc by added water or recirculation of
        steam condensate. The rods are consumed relatively rapidly and
        are fed in succession from the magazine above the reactor. The
        electrodes being consumed more slowly, they are rotated, either
        intermittently as in the first electrode embodiment, or
        continuously as in the other embodiment, to distribute their
        erosion evenly along their peripheral edges. Rotation of the
        electrodes about either vertical or horizontal axes (or
        alternatively about oblique axes) rotates the rods by contact so
        they also erode evenly. When the electrodes have eroded close to
        their axles the reactor is shut down temporarily to enable
        electrode replacement and appropriate maintenance, such as
        reactor cleaning. </p>
      <p>As my issued patent and pending patent applications disclose in
        more detail, the evolved gas is a superior fuel because it does
        not contain a miscellany of organic molecules, whose combustion
        requires a variety of conditions that cannot coexist during
        their combustion, as is true of all petroleum-based fuels.
        Instead, the gaseous fuel evolved by means of the apparatus
        disclosed in my previous efforts and in this application burns
        cleanly to carbon dioxide and water, free of incompletely
        combusted gaseous or solid materials, including carbon monoxide,
        carbonaceous particulates, miscellaneous organic materials, etc.
        Lower temperature of combustion eliminates noxious nitrogen
        oxides accompanying the flashback customary when
        internal-combustion engines are fueled with pure hydrogen. This
        fuel also contains surplus oxygen, thus assuring conversion of
        component carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and conversion of
        hydrogen to water. Other common petroleum fuel contaminants are
        also absent. </p>
      <p>No unusual component materials are required by this invention.
        The electrodes are preferably relatively pure graphite. Suitably
        conductive carbon rods are are available from suppliers of
        welding materials. The conductive rods are customarily composed
        of similar carbon that conducts electricity satisfactorily for
        the purpose. It may be finely divided carbon (or carbonaceous)
        fragments bound by compression, with or without added binder.
        Waste carbon-containing materials are routinely available
        inexpensively from many sources, relative to customarily costly
        carbon-containing industrial solids. Rod diameter for an applied
        gap voltage may be as little as a centimeter or so at about 50
        v. and may be as much as ten centimeters or so at 100 v. or
        higher. A modest amount of experimentation should optimize rod
        composition and diameter for applied voltage and type. </p>
      <p>Water is a low-cost raw material almost everywhere, especially
        as it need not be potable or even relatively pure--as noted
        above. Of course, use of brackish, polluted, or sea water will
        necessitate periodic cleaning and maintenance of the reactor
        tank, the electrode supports and rotation means, and connected
        water-circulation lines. </p>
      <p>The temperature increase in the reactor water provides an added
        advantage of this invention, by enabling production of potable
        water from the same or practically any other water by using the
        surplus heat to vaporize whatever water may be selected, and by
        subsequently condensing it into potable condition, regardless of
        its origin, as by exposing the distilled vapor to ambient
        temperature. </p>
      <p>The electricity requirement is modest because the electrical
        resistance across a conducting spark gap is a minor fraction of
        the the resistance across the same gap when spark-free. The fuel
        is capable of doing much more work than its production entails.
        Nature bound that extra work capacity in the constituent
        materials, and the gap conduction heating enables recovery of
        such chemical potential. </p>
      <p>The major constituent of this fuel gas is hydrogen, whereas its
        predominant minor constituent is carbon monoxide. The fuel is
        less explosive than gasoline, yet its components are readily
        combustible. It may be stored in usual high-pressure gas
        cylinders or in special vehicle-adapted storage cylinders. It
        may be liquefied for storage, if the avantages of liquid fuel
        outweigh the liquefaction costs. </p>
      <p>Preferred embodiments and variants have been suggested for this
        invention. Other modifications may be made, as by adding,
        combining, deleting, or subdividing compositions, parts, or
        steps, while retaining all or some of the advantages and
        benefits of the present invention--which itself is defined in
        the following claims.</p>
