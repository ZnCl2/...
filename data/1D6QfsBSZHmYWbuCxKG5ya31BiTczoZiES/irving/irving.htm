            Theories"</b></big><br>

      <br>
      Were it not for the stern theories regulating the design of air
      screws, we would not be using propellers today which differ but
      little from those of the pioneer panes. Indeed, while airplanes
      and engines have been constantly improved during the past 10
      years, the air screw --- the most important member of any aircraft
      --- has remained practically at&nbsp; a standstill, due to the
      adherences of propeller makers to those orthodox theories which no
      one dared violate.<br>
      <br>
      It has, therefore, remained for James A. Irving of New York City
      to disregard most air screw theories and strike forth along new
      lines. As a result, he has invented a new propeller or tractor
      screw of radical design which, according to the testimony of
      several well-known aviators who have tried it on their machines,
      presents a definite advance in air screws.<br>
      <br>
      Essentially, Mr Irving's device is two propellers in one, as will
      be noted in the accompanying illustrations. In the working model
      shown, one set of blades is 8 feet 6 inches in diameter, while the
      other is about 20% shorter. The longer blades may be termed the
      leading blades, while the shorter ones may be termed the auxiliary
      blades.<br>
      <br>
      The blades are built up of 3-ply ash and mahogany, the latter
      being laminated crosswise of the grain of the two outside strips
      of ash; this arrangement, the inventor holds, is positive
      insurance against splitting. The blades are mounted upon Monel
      metal arms the shanks of which are taper-fitted to a two part hub
      of the same metal, provided with sockets for the purpose. The
      tapered shanks are drawn home and securely held by means of
      specially designed llock-nuts, to any desired pitch which may be
      graduated upon the shanks and hub sockets.<br>
      <br>
      In the side view of the new propeller it will be noted that the
      arms and blades have a dihedral arrangement, which calls for an
      explanation. There are four reasons for this design, according to
      the inventor: First, in effecting centripetal action, drawing and
      forcing air to the center, thus eliminating radial slip; second,
      applied to the auxiliary blades for the purpose of gripping and
      concentrating the air, effecting a powerful center thrust at the
      pint where the conventional propeller is absolutely void of
      impelling force; third, the effect upon the long, leading blades
      where centrifugal force against great air pressure, is to relieve
      the blades of practically all except lateral and torque strains;
      fourth, owing to the fact that the tips of the blades are kept
      under a rigid, constant tension between centrifugal force and air
      pressure, vibration or fluttering is reduced to a minimum or
      entirely eliminated, and this leads to a considerable correction
      of the very objectionable whir or hum of the conventional type of
      propeller. In fact, the proof of the latter is indisputably
      brought out in an electric-fan blade of similar design invented by
      Mr Irving, which is now being offered as the regular equipment of
      a well-known electric desk-type fan, and which is practically
      silent.<br>
      <br>
      Structurally, the new propeller has distinct advantages. The hub
      of the new air screw becomes part of the engine, and any changes
      in blades for any reason can be easily made. Extra leading blades
      can be carried in the airplane for emergency use. In cases of
      ordinary propeller breakage were but one or even both of the
      leading blades would be damaged, the cost of repairs would not
      exceed one-third of the net cost of the complete propeller; in
      short, fully 50% of the new propeller would be practically
      indestructible, outliving several motors.<br>
      <br>
      An ingenious arrangement is provided for the ready balancing of
      the companion blades. Small lead washers are placed in holes in
      both blades, and by transferring washers from one hole to another
      balance is soon established. The washers are held in place by a
      screw in each hole.<br>
      <br>
      One of his objects in making the auxiliary blades shorter than the
      leaders, explains Mr Irving, is for the purpose of obtaining an
      advanced, differential pitch with which to create impelling force
      from the inner, slow-speed circle or "dead" space; and results
      from numerous practical flying tests quite justify the claim that
      the propeller is fully one-third more efficient than the usual
      design, and at no extra cost of power. When used as a tractor, the
      concentrating action of the auxiliary blades results in enveloping
      the fuselage for its entire length within a cylinder of air wash
      of somewhat less diameter than the short blades. It is also
      apparent that these auxiliary blades serve still another and
      valuable purpose, namely, that of forcing or assisting the leading
      blades into undisturbed air. But Mr Irving is not given to
      theories: he merely states that he has a propeller that does the
      work, and that it is more or less inconsequential to the practical
      aviator just how it does the work.<br>
      <br>
      Considerable success has attended the use of Mr Irving's marine
      propeller, designed along the same general lines as his present
      air screw. Some years ago captain Baldwin, a well-known figure in
      American aviation, tested one of Irving's propellers on his "Red
      Devil" biplane. Crude as that propeller was, the results were most
      gratifying. Captain Baldwin was astonished with the climbing power
      and speed of his machine so equipped. Other aviators have also
      been impressed in the same way, after a trial of the propeller
      which ridicules propeller theories.<br>

      <br>
      James A. Irving<br>
      (April 9, 1912)<br>
      <br>
      My invention relates to propellers, and more particularly to
      aeroplane propellers.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments have shown that there is distortion when cutting a
      thread in a solid substance of great resistability. When a thread
      is cut in such an elastic medium as air, which has little normal
      resistibility, this distortion is greatly increased. This
      distortion is analogous to the disturbing of the air by a rotating
      propeller. Investigators of aerial propellers arrive at the
      conclusion that the less a propeller disturbs the air the greater
      its efficiency, and that a theoretical propeller of infinitely
      minute thickness and weight would travel through the air without
      disturbing it its exact pitch distance when rotated one
      revolution, if we disregard the frictional surfaces of the blades;
      but as it is impossible to construct such a propeller or avoid
      frictional surfaces, the problem must be resolves with a propeller
      constructed for practical work, which must necessarily have
      thickness, weight, area and frictional surfaces. Such a propeller
      will set up disturbances in the air which practically preclude its
      being considered as a screw, because these disturbances influence
      or distort the air, and it does not offer the necessary
      resistibility for cutting a screw thread. In constructing
      propellers for aeroplanes, great care must be taken to see that
      the design is such that the propeller will not throw the air
      laterally. This is so for the efficiency of a propeller is due to
      its ability to grip the air, form it into a cone and give to it
      volume, weight and velocity, the sum of these being a mechanically
      created cyclonic force which, projected against substantially
      inert air, propels the aeroplane at the necessary speed to exert
      elevating and sustaining power. Smoke and vapor experiments tend
      to prove that a propeller draws or absorbs air from the space
      around it. This air is condensed and takes the form of a truncated
      cone, with a slightly rotating movement, and is really a modified
      cyclone as the action and effect are almost identical.<br>
      <br>
      My propeller has been so designed not only to disturb the air as
      little as possible, but the blades are adjustable relatively to
      each other and to the hub, to permit of a ready adjustment of the
      blades with reference to the weight, the resisting surface, and
      the frictional surfaces of the aeroplane, and the normal speed of
      the engine.<br>
      <br>

      complete specification, in which the preferred form of my

      By referring to the drawings, it will be seen that a hub is
      provided, consisting of members 10 an 11, there being two
      roughened concave bearing surfaces 12 on the inner face of each of
      the hub members 10 and 11. As shown in Figures 5 and 6 of the
      drawings, I prefer to cut channels 13 in the hub and insert in
      these channels 13 bearing members 14, having the roughened concave
      bearing surfaces 12 referred to. The bearing members 14 are held
      in place by means of screws 27, and I prefer to have them project
      beyond the sides of the hub members. The bearing members 14 on one
      of the hub members co-act with the bearing members 14 on the other
      hub members, to grip the shanks 15 on which the propeller blades
      16 and 17 are mounted. As will be understood by referring to the
      drawings, the bearing members are so disposed relatively to the
      axis of the hub, that the shanks 15 will be disposed at an angle
      to each other, and obliquely relatively to the hub axis. With this
      construction two of the propeller blades are normally disposed in
      advance of the hub, the other two propeller blades extending
      rearwardly of the hub. There are threaded orifices 18 in the hub
      members, which register with each other, and in these threaded
      orifices mesh screw members 19, having angular heads 20. Nuts 21
      are provided for locking the screw members in place, and a face
      plate 22 with angular openings 23 is provided, the angular heads
      20 being normally disposed in the angular openings 23, the face
      plate 22 being secured to the hub member 11 by means of screws 24.
      Two of the propeller blades are constructed by providing side
      members 25, which are bolted to opposite sides of the shank 15, as
      shown in Figures 3 and 4 of the drawings, the peripheries of these
      side members 25 being secured together at 26 by any preferred
      means.<br>
      <br>
      As will be seen in referring to Figures 2 and 7 of the drawings,
      the propeller blades 16 are considerably larger than the propeller
      blades 17, and these blades 16 are preferably the leading blades;
      that is, I prefer to have them extend in a direction in advance of
      the hub, the shorter blades 17 extending rearwardly of the hub. It
      will readily be understood that by removing the face plate 22, and
      unscrewing the screw members 19, the shanks 15 may be rotated as
      my be desired to secure the desired pitch for the propeller
      blades, and that the shanks 15 may also be shifted longitudinally
      to position the propeller blades at predetermined distances from
      the hub. Each of the shanks 15 is divided by marks 15a, which may
      be referred to in obtaining the desired adjustment. The
      arrangement of one forwardly extending set of propeller blades in
      combination with one rearwardly extending set of similar blades
      tends to prevent a vacuum forming around the hub of the propeller,
      and thereby removes undesirable suction.<br>
      <br>
      In Figures 8 and 9 I have shown a divided shank consisting of a
      tubular member 15b having longitudinal slots 15c, the shank member
      15d being disposed in the tubular member 15b. When the tubular
      member 15b is gripped by the bearing member 14 it will press
      against the shank member 15d and hold the tubular member 15b
      relatively to the shank member 15d. With this construction the
      blades 17 may be disposed at any predetermined angle with relation
      to the blades 16.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that the smaller or inner blades 17 may be
      set to a much greater pitch than the larger leading blades 17 and
      that the diameter of the larger blades 16 may be expanded as
      desired. When the positions of the blades 16 are not changed
      relatively to the positions of the blades 17, any increase in the
      pitch of one set of blades will reduce the pitch of the other set
      of blades. The adjustability of the propeller permits of the
      balancing and the setting of the blades of the propeller at the
      desired pitch forced to produce the best results.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      First introduced at the New York National Aviation Show, four
      aircraft propellers bearing Department of Commerce Certificates
      are now offered to the industry by the Maynard-di Cesare Propeller
      Corporation, Milwaukee. The blades of all of these propellers
      feature a decided arc, and three of the four types – the
      automatic, the constant speed, and the adjustable pitch – have the
      blades offset at the hub. The fourth propeller, known as the
      turbine type, has its blades set in the customary manner but is
      otherwise unconventional.<br>
      <br>
      It is claimed that the unique arc of the blades acts to bring the
      point of fatigue four inches closer to the hub, and that the
      offset blade arrangement provides better balance and reduces
      propeller vibration transmitted to the engine. Improved engine
      cooling is also claimed as a feature of the design. A further
      claim is that these propellers are considerably lighter in weight
      than present types.<br>
      <br>
      All of these propellers have been developed under the direction of
      Lieut. Pierino di Cesare.<br>
