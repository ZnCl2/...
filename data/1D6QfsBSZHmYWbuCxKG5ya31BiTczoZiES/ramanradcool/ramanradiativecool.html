          in Darkness</b><br>
        <i>It doesn’t generate much power, but it works during the one
          time of day that solar cells can’t : night.</i><br>
        <b>By Rebecca Boyle</b><br>

      Sept. 12, 2019<br>
      <br>
      Aaswath Raman was driving through a village in Sierra Leone in
      2013 when an idea came to him as suddenly as, perhaps, a light
      bulb switching on.<br>
      <br>
      The village was not equipped with electricity, and Dr. Raman, an
      electrical engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles,
      was unaware he was in a village until he heard the voices of
      shadowed human figures.<br>
      <br>
      “It took us about five minutes to realize we were passing through
      a town, because it was completely dark,” Dr. Raman said. “There
      wasn’t a single light on.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Raman wondered whether he could use all that darkness to make
      something to light it up, not unlike the way that solar panels
      generate electricity from the sun’s heat and light. <br>
      <br>
      He did. In new research published on Thursday in the journal
      Joule, Dr. Raman demonstrated a way to harness a dark night sky to
      power a light bulb.<br>
      <br>
      His prototype device employs radiative cooling, the phenomenon
      that makes buildings and parks feel cooler than the surrounding
      air after sunset. As Dr. Raman’s device releases heat, it does so
      unevenly, the top side cooling more than the bottom. It then
      converts the difference in heat into electricity. In the paper,
      Dr. Raman described how the device, when connected to a voltage
      converter, was able to power a white LED.<br>
      <br>
      “The core enabling feature of this device is that it can cool
      down,” Dr. Raman said.<br>
      <br>
      Jeffrey C. Grossman, a materials scientist at the Massachusetts
      Institute of Technology who studies passive cooling and solar
      technology, said the work was “quite exciting” and showed promise
      for the development of low-power applications at night.<br>
      <br>
      “They have suggested reasonable paths for increasing the
      performance of their device,” Dr. Grossman said. “But there is
      definitely a long way to go if they want to use it as an
      alternative to adding battery storage for solar cells.”<br>
      <br>
      Everything emits heat, according to the laws of thermodynamics. At
      night, when one side of Earth turns away from the sun, its
      buildings, streets and jacket-less people cool off. If no clouds
      are present to trap warmth, objects on the Earth can lose so much
      heat that they reach a lower temperature than the air surrounding
      them. This is why blades of grass may be glazed in frost on clear
      fall mornings, even when the air temperature is above freezing.
      The cloudless atmosphere becomes a porthole to the void, through
      which warmth flows like air through a porch screen.<br>
      <br>
      Humans have taken advantage of this effect for millenniums. Six
      thousand years ago, people in what are now Iran and Afghanistan
      constructed enormous beehive-shaped structures called yakhchal,
      which used this passive cooling effect to create and store ice in
      the desert.<br>
      <br>
      Modern scientists have studied how to harness energy from Earth’s
      day-night swings in temperature, but that work has mostly remained
      theoretical. In 2014, researchers led by Federico Capasso, an
      electrical engineering professor at Harvard, calculated that at
      best only about 4 watts of energy can be extracted from a square
      meter of cold space. By contrast, a photovoltaic panel, the most
      common type of solar panel, generates about 200 watts per square
      meter in direct sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      Nonetheless, a device that could produce any amount of electricity
      at night would be valuable; after the sun sets, solar cells don’t
      work and winds often die down, even as demand for lighting peaks.<br>
      <br>
      Shanhui Fan, an electrical engineer at Stanford and an author on
      Dr. Raman’s study, has been at the vanguard of this research. Last
      fall, Dr. Fan’s team described a device that can generate
      electricity with solar panels during the day, then use the passive
      cooling effect to chill a building at night. Earlier this year,
      they also tested an infrared photodiode, similar to the technology
      used in most solar cells but which uses warmth, not sunlight, to
      generate wisps of electricity in the darkness.<br>
      <br>
      The prototype built by Dr. Raman resembles a hockey puck set
      inside a chafing dish. The puck is a polystyrene disk coated in
      black paint and covered with a wind shield. At its heart is an
      off-the shelf gadget called a thermoelectric generator, which uses
      the difference in temperature between opposite sides of the device
      to generate a current. A similar device powers NASA’s Curiosity
      rover on Mars; its thermoelectric generator derives heat from
      plutonium radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Usually, the temperature difference in these generators is stark,
      and they are carefully engineered to separate hot and cold. Dr.
      Raman’s device instead uses the atmosphere’s ambient temperature
      as the heat source. The shift from warm to cool is very slight,
      meaning the device can’t produce much power.<br>
      <br>
      His puck-in-a-dish is elevated on aluminum legs, enabling air to
      flow around it. As the dark puck loses warmth to the night sky,
      the side facing the stars grows colder than the side facing the
      air-warmed tabletop. This slight difference in temperature
      generates a flow of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      When paired with a voltage converter, the prototype produced 25
      milliwatts of power per square meter. That is about three orders
      of magnitude lower than what a typical solar panel produces, and
      well short of even the roughly 4-watt maximum efficiency for such
      devices. Still, several experts said the prototype was an
      important contribution to a new and relatively unusual space in
      the renewable energy sector.<br>
      <br>
      “This is a neat combination of radiative cooling — a technique
      where Raman has pioneered real working devices — with
      thermoelectric materials that generate electricity if one side is
      hotter than the other side,” said Ellen D. Williams, a physics
      professor at the University of Maryland and a former director of
      the Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects
      Agency-Energy. “Both technologies are proven and practical, but I
      haven’t seen them combined like this. They did this with
      inexpensive materials, suggesting it could be made into useful
      products for the developing world.”<br>
      <br>
      One challenge will be improving the device’s efficiency without
      raising its costs, said Lance Wheeler, a materials scientist at
      the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo. Although
      thermoelectric devices are less efficient and more expensive than
      photovoltaic cells, they can be more durable.<br>
      <br>
      “You could call this a long play,” he said. “It is just a piece of
      metal with spray paint on it. It could last for a super long time,
      and its rivals, photovoltaic cells and batteries, don’t. It can
      enhance any thermoelectric device as long as it’s outside facing
      the stars.”<br>
      <br>
      Conceivably, Dr. Raman said, thermoelectric devices could
      complement solar-powered lights in areas where changing batteries
      is a challenge, like on street lamps or in remote areas far from
      electrical grids.<br>
      <br>
      “I figured the amount of electricity we could get would be pretty
      small, and it was,” he said. “But walking around in Sierra Leone,
      I realized lighting remains a big problem, so it’s an opportunity
      as well.”<br>

      </div>
      <b></b><b>Highlights</b><b><br>
      </b>A thermoelectric generator is built whose cold side radiates
      heat to the sky<br>
      Night-time power generation of 25 mW/m 2 is demonstrated,
      sufficient for a LED<br>
      Pathways to performance &gt; 0.5 W/m 2 using existing commodity
      components exist<br>
      This approach is immediately practical for lighting and off-grid
      sensors<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b>A large fraction of the world’s population still lacks access
      to electricity, particularly at night when photovoltaic systems no
      longer operate. The ability to generate electricity at night could
      be a fundamentally enabling capability for a wide range of
      applications, including lighting and low-power sensors. Here, we
      demonstrate a low-cost strategy to harness the cold of space
      through radiative cooling to generate electricity with an
      off-the-shelf thermoelectric generator. Unlike traditional
      thermoelectric generators, our device couples the cold side of the
      thermoelectric module to a sky-facing surface that radiates heat
      to the cold of space and has its warm side heated by the
      surrounding air, enabling electricity generation at night. We
      experimentally demonstrate 25 mW/m 2 of power generation and
      validate a model that accurately captures the device’s
      performance. Further, we show that the device can directly power a
      light emitting diode, thereby generating light from the darkness
      of space itself.<br>

      <br>
      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b>The sun and outer space are the two most important fundamental
      thermodynamics resources for human beings on Earth. The capability
      for harvesting solar energy has been of central importance
      throughout the history of human civilization. Harvesting the
      coldness of outer space using radiative cooling technology also
      has a long history and has received renewed interest recently.
      However, simultaneously and synergistically harvesting energy from
      these two thermodynamics resources has never been realized. Here
      we report the first experimental demonstration of such
      simultaneous energy harvesting using a configuration where a solar
      absorber that is transparent in mid-infrared is placed above a
      radiative cooler. The solar absorber is heated to 24°C above the
      ambient temperature and provides a shading mechanism that enables
      the radiative cooler to reach 29°C below the ambient temperature.
      This work points to a new avenue for harvesting of renewable
      energy resources.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>We experimentally demonstrate electric power generation from
      the coldness of the universe directly, using the negative
      illumination effect when an infrared semiconductor diode faces the
      sky. Our theoretical model, accounting for the experimental
      results, indicates that the performance of such a power generation
      scheme is strongly influenced by the degree of matching between
      the responsivity spectrum and the atmospheric transparency window,
      as well as the quantum efficiency of the diode. A
      Shockley-Queisser analysis of an ideal optimized diode, taking
      into consideration the realistic transmissivity spectrum of the
      atmosphere, indicates the theoretical maximum power density of
      3.99 W/m2 with the diode temperature at 293 K. The results here
      point to a pathway towards night-time power generation.<br>
