      Lieutenant-General Sir John Bagot Glubb, KCB, CMG, DSO, OBE, MC
      better known as Glubb Pasha (born 16 April 1897, Preston,
      Lancashire – died 17 March 1986, Mayfield, Sussex), was a British
      soldier, scholar and author, who led and trained Transjordan's
      Arab Legion between 1939 and 1956 as its commanding general.
      During the First World War, he served in France.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Life</b><br>
      <br>
      Educated at Cheltenham College, he was commissioned into the Royal
      Engineers in 1915. He was seriously wounded on the Western front,
      his jaw being shattered. In later years this would lead to the
      Arab nickname of abu Hunaik, meaning "the one with the little
      jaw." He was then transferred to Iraq in 1920, which was governed
      by Britain according to the League of Nations Mandate. He became
      an officer of the Arab Legion in 1930. The next year he formed the
      Desert Patrol — a force consisting exclusively of Bedouin — to
      curb the raiding problem that plagued the southern part of the
      country. Within a few years he had persuaded the Bedouin to
      abandon their habit of raiding neighbouring tribes.<br>
      <br>
      In 1939, Glubb succeeded Frederick G. Peake as the commander of
      the Arab Legion (Now known as Jordan Royal Army). During this
      period, he transformed the legion into the best trained force in
      the Arab world.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Encyclopædia of the Orient:<br>
      <br>
      Glubb served his home country all through his years in the Middle
      East, making him immensely unpopular in the end. Arab nationalists
      believed that he had been the force behind pressure that made King
      Hussein I of Jordan join the Baghdad Pact. Glubb served different
      high positions in the Arab Legion, the army of Transjordan. During
      World War II he led attacks on Arab leaders in Iraq, as well as
      the Vichy regime which was present in Lebanon and Syria. [1]<br>
      <br>
      During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War the Arab Legion was considered
      the strongest Arab army involved in the war. Glubb led the Arab
      Legion across Jordan to occupy the West Bank. Despite some
      negotiation and understanding between the Jewish Agency and King
      Abdullah, severe fighting took place in Kfar Etzion, Jerusalem and
      Latrun. According to Avi Shlaim,<br>
      <br>
      Rumours that Abdullah was once again in contact with the Jewish
      leaders further damaged his standing in the Arab world. His many
      critics suggested that he was prepared to compromise the Arab
      claim to the whole of Palestine as long as he could acquire part
      of Palestine for himself. 'The internecine struggles of the
      Arabs,' reported Glubb, 'are more in the minds of Arab politicians
      than the struggle against the Jews. Azzam Pasha, the mufti and the
      Syrian government would sooner see the Jews get the whole of
      Palestine than that King Abdullah should benefit.' (p. 96)<br>
      <br>
      Glubb remained in charge of the defence of the West Bank following
      the armistice in March 1949, and as the commander of the Arab
      Legion until 1 March 1956, when he was dismissed by King Hussein
      who wanted to distance himself from the British and disprove the
      contention of Arab nationalists that Glubb was the actual ruler of
      Jordan. Differences between Glubb and Hussein had been apparent
      since 1952, especially over defence arrangements, the promotion of
      Arab officers and the funding of the Arab Legion. Despite his
      decommission, which was forced upon him by public opinion, he
      remained a close friend of the king. He spent the remainder of his
      life writing books and articles, mostly on the Middle East and his
      experiences with the Arabs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Honours</b><br>
      <br>
      Glubb was appointed OBE in 1925; CMG in 1946; and KCB in 1956.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Family</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1938, Glubb married Muriel Rosemary Forbes, the daughter of
      physician James Graham Forbes. The couple had a son, Godfrey
      (named after the Crusader King Godfrey of Bouillon) born in
      Jerusalem in 1939, and adopted a Bedouin girl in 1944 and another
      daughter and son, his daughter from Palestinian refugees and son
      (named before Atalla) from Jordanian Bedouins] in 1947. One of his
      sons died soon after birth, on the same day as Dunkirk (see his
      Memoirs).<br>
      <br>
      Glubb's father was Major-General Sir Frederic Manley Glubb, of
      Lancashire, who had been chief engineer in the British Second Army
      in the First World War; his mother was Letitia Bagot from County
      Roscommon.[1] He was a brother of the racing driver Gwenda Hawkes.<br>
      <br>
      Sir John died in 1986 at his home in Mayfield, East Sussex, and is
      buried in the graveyard at St. Dunstan's Church in the village.
      King Hussein gave the eulogy at the service of thanksgiving for
      Glubb's life, held in Westminster Abbey on 17 April 1986.[2] Lady
      Glubb died in September 2005 and is interred with her husband.
      Their son, Godfrey, converted to Islam as a young man and took the
      name of Faris, becoming a prominent journalist and researcher into
      the Palestinian cause. He was killed in an accident in Kuwait in
      April 2004. Daughter Naomi died in July 2010.[3]<br>
