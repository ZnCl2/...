      <p><b>This is the Hand of the Philosophers</b> with their dear
        secret
        signs,
        with which the old sages united with each other and took secret
        oaths.
        Nobody can understand this hand with its secret signs, unless he
        becomes
        first a juror of the philosophers, (one who swore loyalty to a
        philosopher),
        and has loyally served them in the Art Alchemia. Consequently,
        those
        who
        have not this Hand and do not understand its secret signs, nor
        have
        taken
        the oath of loyalty, are bastards in this Art. They do not
        possess the
        philosophers’ treasure. That is why I advise all those who do
        not
        possess
        the secrets of the Hand not to start working in the alchemical
        Art, nor
        to believe books or writings, since they will all only be
        cheated in
        the
        secrets of the Hand. Therefore, everybody had better be careful.
      </p>
      <p>In this Hand is locked the secret of the philosophers, that is,
        of
        the
        seed and the earth, as will be told later. </p>
      <p>Now then, I will teach my child and describe the secret, hidden
        matter
        of the wise philosophers and masters of the true Art Alchemia.
        Nobody
        can
        use it unless he take the oath and swear not to divulge the Art
        and
        secrets
        and hidden signs of the sages, except he finds that it would be
        a good
        placement. In that case, he should also request the oath that
        that man
        should not use the Art except for the salvation of his soul.
        Only then
        can he be given the secret signs of the philosophers or sages,
        with
        their
        hidden signs and meanings. </p>
      <p><b>1. The Thumb</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="crown.jpg" height="83" width="160"></p>
      </center>
      <p>First look at the thumb on which stands the crown next to the
        moon,
        one quarter old. By this is meant saltpetre. For just as the
        thumb
        vigorously
        finishes off the hand, saltpeter does in the Art Alchemia, for
        he is
        the
        King and Lord of all salts. He is the mill through which
        everything
        must
        be ground. His nature is elsewhere sufficiently described. </p>
      <p><b>2. Index</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="star.jpg" height="96" width="107"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The second sign and secret of the philosophers is the Star with
        six
        points, standing above the foremost finger next to the thumb. It
        is
        compared
        to Roman Vitriolo, because no work that is to be perfect can be
        completed
        without vitriol; for it is the greatest and strongest salt after
        saltpeter.
        Its nature is described. </p>
      <p><b>3. The Middle Finger</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="sun.jpg" height="142" width="147"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The third sign of the philosopher’s Hand is the Sun, standing
        above
        the third finger. By it, Sal Ammoniacum is designated, for apart
        from
        saltpeter
        and vitriol, no thing more powerful is found than *. That is why
        it is
        the third secret. </p>
      <p><b>4. The Ring Finger</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="lantern.jpg" height="225" width="94"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The fourth sign of the philosophers is the Lantern, standing
        above
        the
        fourth finger of the Hand, whereby Alum Roche is indicated; for
        without
        alum, no perfect work can be accomplished, because it is
        required for
        the
        Red and the White. It has an astonishing nature and the most
        subtle
        Spiritus.
        It is described elsewhere. </p>
      <p><b>5. The Little Finger</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="key.jpg" height="199" width="94"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The fifth secret and sign is the Key of the philosophers,
        standing
        above
        the little finger. Simultaneously, it is the lock of the hand.
        That is
        why the key is standing on it. By it, common salt is designated,
        for
        salt
        is the Key in this Art. </p>
      <p><b>6. The Middle of the Hand</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fish.jpg" height="187" width="337"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The sixth secret sign is the Fish. It stands in the middle of
        the
        Hand
        and signifies Mercury, for without Mercury, or the fish, nothing
        can be
        done. He is the beginning, the middle and the end, and he is the
        priest
        who must marry everything. And he is the male and the seed; he
        is the
        water
        out of which all metals have originated; and he is the principal
        (factor)
        of all Arts, and the greatest of all secrets. </p>
      <p><b>7. The Palm</b> </p>
      <p>The seventh sign of the philosophers is Fire. By this Sulphur
        is
        indicated.
        It is the earth and beginning of all metals. It is the female
        who
        brings
        forth the fruit. For no seed can grow unless it be first thrown
        into
        fertile
        soil. Then beautiful fruit will come from it. Thus it also
        happens tat
        when a pure Mercury is joined to a pure Sulphur, it brings forth
        pure
        fruit.
        Thus, they are man and woman, father and mother, fire and water,
        seed
        and
        earth. This is sufficient about the seven secret signs of the
        philosophers.
        He who understands well this Hand and its sign, and can work
        with it,
        will
        derive joy from it. Now follows the Preparation. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <center>
        <p><b>The Preparation of Saltpetre</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take living chalk (quicklime), according to the quantity of the
        substance.
        Pour on it a good amount of urine. Let the lime slake in it;
        after it
        is
        slaked, let it settle, and pour it off above. If there are 6 lb
        of
        saltpeter,
        take 12 lb or pints of pure urine, even a little more, but not
        less.
        Put
        it all together into a clean kettle. Boil it and skim it with an
        iron
        spoon.
        Put the latter occasionally into the Liquor and squirt it into
        the
        fire.
        If it burns, or the coal becomes ignited by it, it is enough:
        Take it
        off
        and let it cool somewhat. Now pour it into a large linen sack,
        like a
        claret
        sack. This sack has to hang above a barrel, 5 feet above. Soon
        there
        sprout
        cones in the water, one above the other, as if it were crystal.
        Take
        these
        out --- it is the purified saltpeter. Now take the other
        saltpeter
        which
        did not sprout into cones. Fish it out and put it into the
        urine. Let
        it
        boil again as before and pour it also through the sack. It will
        immediately
        crystallize into long streaks, like the first. What stays behind
        is
        good
        for nothing; it is only salt which can be coagulated, and then
        it is
        common
        saltpeter. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <center>
        <p><b>This is the Manual Work Done with the Crown or Saltpeter</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take 4 lb of the Crown, prepared egg chalk, Sal Alcali made of
        quicklime,
        weedashes, potash of Sal Vitri of afterwine (tartar lees) or
        shoots of
        vine, calcined Tartarum, in equal amounts. These things must be
        prepared
        with the hand, as you well know. When they are prepared,
        dissolve them
        in distilled vinegar. Hang them in the balneum to dissolve there
        for 21
        days and nights. Then coagulate them in the Alembicum, and keep
        the
        matter
        clean, so that no dust or impurity can get at it. After this,
        put them
        into a round, earthenware vessel, as illustrated here. Put it in
        Tripode
        or in the Athanor till the King is fixed. Regulate the fire so
        that you
        can barely keep your hand in it --- for the first 8 days. After
        this,
        let
        the vessel glow for another 8 days; but before you do this,
        divide it
        as
        if you wished to burn separating water; drive everything over
        that will
        come over, for it is of no use to the work, since the volatile
        spirits
        spoil all works, so that they cannot reach the state of
        fixation.
        Therefore,
        before putting it in Tripode to calcine, get rid of the volatile
        spirits,
        otherwise your work would not get fixed. </p>
      <p>When it has been standing in Tripode for 14 days, take it out.
        Take
        2 lb of the Long Finger, which must have been sublimated 3 times
        through
        salt. Pulverize it with the powder you took out of the Tripode,
        and
        sublimate
        them together till the Long Finger becomes fixed. </p>
      <p>Now dissolve this fixed powder 7 times in good, distilled
        vinegar.
        Let
        it settle each time, and each time separate the Faeces, and
        congeal it
        again in the Alembic. Then glow the King in the fire, but take
        care
        that
        he does not melt. Do this 7 times, by dissolving, congealing,
        and
        glowing
        as before. Then the saltpeter is well prepared for the work.
        Keep it in
        a closed box of Cyprian earth, glazed with glass, and you will
        have an
        infinite treasure, greater than you might believe, with which
        you can
        accomplish
        wonderful things. I will describe to you only one part of its
        effect,
        should
        you need the Art: By it you can turn all seven metals into their
        first
        nature, that is, into Mercury. </p>
      <p>To this end you must take a good amount of distilled vinegar
        and&nbsp;<img src="acetv.jpg" height="25" width="21">,
        and&nbsp;<img src="z.jpg" height="20" width="11"> 8 of raw *;
        add to it
        whatever
        metal you wish, provided it is calcined, then quickly seal the
        jar and
        put it in Balneum or in horse manure for 21 days. After that,
        put it on
        fire with the Alembic, and distill. First there will be vinegar
        and *,
        afterwards the essence of the metal, that is, Mercury. With that
        you
        can
        do astonishing things. But there is a great deal of cheating in
        this;
        that
        is why we do not wish to describe it. When you have used the
        King and
        he
        has done his work, let the faeces drop, pour off the pure, and
        coagulate
        as before. Then he will be better than before, because his power
        has
        grown
        tenfold by having been dissolved and purified with Acetum and
        [??], as
        also next to the *, and by having been water and then congealed.
        One
        performs
        miracles with this King; that is why he carries the crown. </p>
      <p>Also, he makes all red metals white, and all soft metals hard,
        and
        all
        hard metals soft, and I write more than have been commanded to.
      </p>
      <p>Also, make an Aqua Fort of nitre, O, vitriol and * ; and to a
        quarter
        lb of this AF, add&nbsp;<img src="z.jpg" height="20" width="11">
        ij *;
        dissolve
        in it ij lb mercury; draw off the AF per Balneum, and you will
        thus
        kill
        mercury. Then take 4 lb of common salt to every 2 lb of this
        Mercury.
        Mix
        and pound it well together in a mortar; then sublimate it; then
        take it
        out and pound it again with salt as before, and sublimate it.
        Repeat
        this
        7 times. </p>
      <p>After this, take 1 lb salt, 1/2 lb *, mix them well with the
        sublimated
        mercury, and sublimate again. When it is sublimated, take it
        out, and
        mix
        it again with fresh salt alone; sublimate again, and do this 3
        or 4
        times.
        Now pound it fine and put it into a glass vessel and set it to
        calcinate
        in the philosophers’ stove for 30 days and nights. </p>
      <p>Then remove it, and dissolve it in balneo or on a stone in the
        cellar.
        When everything has been dissolved, put it to distill 7 times in
        Balneo,
        till everything has become hard. Then take it out, pulverize it
        small,
        and imbibe it with water of silver made thus: </p>
      <p>Take fine cupel silver; cement it till it comes out white from
        the
        salt;
        dissolve it in AF; then draw it off per Balneum; take it out,
        add to it
        as much * as there is silver, pulverize them together, and dry
        it. Then
        calcinate it for 30 days in the philosophers’ furnace. After
        this,
        dissolve
        it in Balneo or on a stone. Imbibe this water into your powder,
        and put
        it into a glass to distill per Alembicum, so as to draw off the
        humidity.
        When it is dry, take it out and imbibe it again with silver
        water. Do
        this
        till all the water of silver has been imbibed into it. Finally,
        let it
        stand on the fire till all your matter is fixed. Then make your
        matter
        fusible till it melts like butter. </p>
      <p>Also, when you have drawn out the Red from the foremost finger,
        or
        from
        the fire, or from several other things, take 1 lb of the dry
        powder and
        1 lb of the sun. But the sun must first have been 3 times
        sublimated
        through
        the key till it is transparent. Then take 1 part of the Red, 1/2
        part
        of
        the sun, powder them together and sublimate them. Then the sun
        will
        sublimate
        up, and the Red will stay at the bottom of the vessel. Take the
        sun out
        above and mix it again with the Red that stayed at the bottom of
        the
        vessel.
        Sublimate it again as before, at least 10 or 12 times. Now take
        the
        same
        sun and the same Red, powder them impalpably, and put them into
        the
        philosophers’
        furnace to quickly calcine for 30 days. Then take it out and
        dissolve
        it
        in Balneo. When everything is dissolved, you have a brilliant
        water
        with
        which gold would not want to be compared. Imbibe your elixir
        with this
        red water as you know. </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <center>
        <p><b>Preparation of Vitriol</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take 3 or 4 lb Vitriolum Romanum, dissolve it in Balneo,
        clarify
        it
        of its own impurity, and calcine it till it begins getting grey.
        Then
        dissolve
        it again, and let everything become pure again. Then calcine it
        until
        it
        becomes yellow. Now take the Tincture of Auripigment and
        gradually
        imbibe
        it onto it. Dry it carefully, imbibe it and dry it again until
        everything
        has been imbibed into it. Then it is ready to sublimate Mercury
        through
        it, so long that he no longer desires anything. Then his stomach
        is
        full,
        and add each time fresh Species. Then it turns into a precious
        Mercury
        and a salt more splendid than gold. </p>

        <p><b>How to Extract Quintam Essentiam from Vitriol or the
            Philosophers’
            Stone from the Hand.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take 6 lb of glorified vitriol, as you well know how to make.
        Dry
        out
        all its humidity. Then 3 or 4 lb of the Fish and 1 lb of the
        prepared
        key.
        Mix them together and put them to sublime. The Tincture will
        rise with
        the Fish in a secret and invisible way. If you wish to sublimate
        the
        Fish
        once again with fresh vitriol and fresh Key, you may do so. Then
        you
        have
        the fish full of Tincture, but if you wished to separate the
        latter,
        make
        a water of the hand, or a bad water with salt, or made with some
        of the
        long (Middle) finger. Put the sublimated Fish, which is full of
        the
        Tincture
        of the Star, into the Balneum, and it will dissolve into water.
      </p>
      <p>Now take 6, 8, or 10 lb of the key, which has been prepared to
        sublimate
        through it. Put the Key into a Syburg jar and pour into it, upon
        the
        Key,
        what has been dissolved, so that it turns into a dry Materia.
        Otherwise
        the water would not putrify or go up in smoke. Put the jar in
        Balneum,
        add a helm, and distill the AF over in a boiling Balneum, till
        nothing
        comes over. Following this, set the jar into sand, and more
        spirits of
        the AF will go over which did not rise out of the balneum. </p>
      <p>When all the Spiritus have gone over, increase your fire and
        you
        will
        see the Quinta Essentia, or Tincture of the Fish and the said
        Star,
        sublimate
        as if it were a crystal stone. Remove it carefully from the
        Alembic and
        dissolve it again in fresh AF. Repeat this 4 times, and the
        tinctures
        of
        QE of the Fish will become so subtle that it is unbelievable to
        write
        about
        it. The reason for it is that it was first dissolved and
        afterwards
        sublimated,
        and that it is killed and rises into a spiritual Corpus. In my
        estimation,
        it should be distilled and afterwards sublimated so often that
        it will
        obtain such great power that it would be worth a kingdom. Now
        you have
        the QE Vitrioli and Mercurii together. </p>
      <p>If you wish to make an Elixir of it, you must calcine it in
        Tripode;
        then dissolve it in Balneo with the water of the Hand; distill
        and
        sublimate
        it, and add the soul to it, and congeal it, as I have taught of
        other
        stones.
        But if you wish to separate the tincture of the Star from the
        Fish,
        take
        good * and distilled vinegar. Pulverize the QE and put it into
        the
        vinegar.
        Set it into the Balneum. The Mercury will sink to the bottom,
        and the
        QE
        of the vitriol will go into the vinegar. Pour off the tinged
        vinegar,
        and
        pour fresh upon it. Put it back into the Balneum, and repeat
        this till
        the vinegar no longer tinges. Now put all the tinged vinegar
        together
        and
        take other vinegar. In it, slake iron or steel 10 or 12 times.
        Now pour
        that to the tinged acetum, put it into a large glass and distill
        all
        the
        vinegar per Alembicum and in the Balneum. What remains, will be
        the
        most
        beautiful redness of the world, because the tincture of the Fish
        stayed
        with the tincture of the Star. That is why the Fish is no longer
        of any
        use when the tincture of the Star is drawn off, because they
        both have
        the same nature. </p>
      <p>With this tincture, you can work miracles, because it is
        indestructible
        just as heaven is incombustible; it changes everything into its
        nature
        and color, and thus it does to all stones and pearls. </p>

        <p><b>The Preparation of the Sun or, Sal Ammoniaci</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Ammoniac is of different kinds, that is, natural and
        artificial.
        Natural
        ammoniac is found in the earth, and it is again twofold, white
        and red.
        Both are extracted from hard clean ores. It is sweet of taste;
        its
        nature
        is hot and dry; and it is good for washing and purifying.
        Further,
        there
        is also an artificial *, and that is better for this work than
        the
        natural;
        it is also nobler than salt, and changes Mercury into water.
        When it
        has
        been prepared with it, grind it and put it into a humid spot to
        dissolve.
        With it, one accomplishes the solution of iron and lead into
        living
        silver;
        and it is gold which the dryness of the fire has congealed. It
        is hot
        and
        humid and is a subtle spirit for the Elixir, for without it, it
        could
        not
        be done. How to sublimate it, I will yet teach you, although
        through it
        the Corpora are not transmuted white or red into another
        substance,
        except
        by means of other spirits, it nevertheless gives to the spirits
        their
        entrance
        and exit; it purges and cleans the Corpora of their blackness,
        leaving
        the spirits mingles with the bodies, while itself going away. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Ammoniac is the sun of the philosophers, which shines through
        all
        things
        and is the noblest Secret of the hand, for by it I will teach
        you how
        to
        make the whole secret of the Tinctures, and in this way you can,
        if you
        wish, extract all other tinctures and use them for the great
        philosophers’
        stone. For the Lapis Minor you extract the things from the
        minerals,
        for
        the Lapis Majori from the herbs and Species that are not human;
        for
        like
        makes its like, a horse begets a horse, etc. Therefore, prepare
        like to
        its like; otherwise you follow wrong ways in this Art. </p>
      <p>First I will teach you how to extract the tincture from gold,
        and
        how
        to make spirit and oil. Change the gold to a subtle calx through
        calcinations.
        Then take a broad glass slab or a glass vessel. Put the calx
        into it
        and
        pour on it good distilled wine vinegar. Into a Nossel, put 3j of
        the
        middle
        finger’s Sun, and pour it on the gold calx in the vessel,
        reaching two
        fingers’ breadth above it. Set it into the Balneum or in a hot
        reflection
        of the sun. Then there will arise a small yellow skin on top, as
        if it
        were oil. Remove this with a silver gilt spoon, or with a
        feather. Do
        this
        several times a day, till nothing else arises to the top. Put
        what you
        have skimmed off into the Balneum and let the humidity
        evaporate. Then
        an oil will remain, or the QE, which is so wonderful, it is
        beyond your
        belief. </p>
      <p>One can do just as well with pure, old urine, as with vinegar.
        Then
        there still remains earth in that which stays in the vessel and
        out of
        which you have drawn the QE. Put that also into the Balneum. Let
        the
        vinegar,
        or old urine, evaporate, and the earth of the Sun will stay
        behind. And
        when the earth has been prepared, bring it back to its QE as it
        should
        be. Now you have an elixir and a glorified Corpus and an earthly
        treasure
        far greater than can be believed. For that, thank God Almighty.

        <p><b>Preparation of Alum, or, Water of the Lantern</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take a new earthenware pot with a fitting cover. In it,
        pulverize
        as
        much Alum de Roche to half fill the pot. Lute it well so that no
        air
        can
        escape. Put it over a small fire and listen to the pot. When it
        is no
        longer
        boiling, decrease your fire, and finally, let the pot sit in the
        glow
        for
        about one hour, or thereabouts, after this, remove the pot and
        you can
        allow it to then cool off. The alum has been calcined enough to
        make
        water
        from it. Dissolve this calx in distilled vinegar that has been
        well
        rectified.
        Then remove it from the ashes and congeal it in a glass. Now put
        it
        over
        a blue stone and congeal it in a glass. Now put it over a blue
        stone so
        as to dissolve it, and keep the water, for by it one can
        dissolve
        mercury
        into clear water. This is the right alum water with which to
        imbibe all
        Corpora that one wishes to make Alba or white. Likewise, put
        some of
        this
        water into an iron spoon or pan, pour mercury into it, let it
        boil till
        it gets clear. Then pour it into a small vessel and set it in
        the sun.
        It will congeal and become so hard that it cannot be broken with
        the
        fingers. </p>

      <p>Take 10 lb of alum, and purify it by dissolving it. Then take 2
        lb
        of
        white vitriol, 3 lb of tartar, and 3 lb of Sal Alcali, and these
        must
        be
        purified; also 2 lb of Sal Vitri, 12 lb of Sal Gemmae, taken
        from the
        apothecary;
        further, 4 lb of the Key and egg calx 4 lb. All these have to be
        purified. </p>
      <p>Now take the white of 100 hardboiled and pulverized eggs, put
        into
        distilled
        vinegar in addition to 1 lb of *, also tartar, Alcali, of each 1
        lb;
        common
        salt, 4 lb. Put everything into a jar, luted, and set into the
        Balneum,
        or in horse manure, for 6 weeks. Let it dissolve into water;
        then
        remove
        it and distill. First, the * will come, then the acetum; and the
        blessed
        white water that stays in the retort, preserve it till you need
        more of
        it, because it is also good for other works. </p>
      <p>Now take the vinegar, the *, and the egg water, and imbibe with
        that
        your powder. Dry it in Alembicum, so that it may stay pure. Do
        this
        till
        all the water has been imbibed into the powder. Set the water to
        calcine
        in Tripode for 14 days or longer, and regulate your fire in such
        a way
        that you can just keep your hand in it through the hole. </p>
      <p>After this, take it out. Take 2 lb of *, and sublimate it
        through
        this
        powder till it is fixed. Then dissolve the powder 7 times in
        distilled
        vinegar, and again congeal it in the Alembic, so that it may
        stay pure.
        After it has been dissolved as often and has finally been
        congealed,
        put
        it in the Balneum to dissolve, or in a cellar, or in horse
        manure. Then
        the Lantern is prepared, and you have an earthly treasure, the
        whitest
        water one can see with one’s eyes, and it transforms all things
        into
        the
        White, no matter what one cooks in it, be it metal or rock. With
        it one
        can make mercury fixed in many different ways, and you,
        nevertheless,
        keep
        almost all of your lantern, and almost your previous weight.
        Anything
        you
        wish to get pure and white, such as pearls, put them into this
        water
        and
        you will see wonders. It transforms all metals into mercury, if
        they
        are
        cooked in it in Balneo. I must not write more. </p>
      <p>Now take the water of the hand and 1 lb of the impalpable
        powder
        of
        the Key. Sublimate them, well mixed together beforehand, 7, 8,
        or 10
        times,
        each time with fresh key. After this, pulverize it impalpably on
        a
        glass
        slab with 1 lb of the middle Finger, 2 lb of the Fire, 2 lb of
        salt.
        Sublimate
        7 times, each time with fresh salt; finally pound it and set it
        in
        Tripode
        to calcine for 30 days, heating gently the first 8 days, then
        gradually
        stronger. The last 8 days, let it become so hot that you would
        hardly
        hold
        your hand in Tripode for one Ave Maria. Then take it out, powder
        it on
        a stone, then dissolve it into water in Balneo. Occasionally, it
        does
        not
        easily dissolve. That is due to the fact that it has not been
        sufficiently
        cooked during calcinations, since one has to stir it once every
        day,
        what
        is at the bottom has to be turned uppermost; and if something
        has been
        sublimated up, put it down again and continue calcining. When it
        is
        dissolved,
        preserve it at once in a glass, well stoppered with something. </p>
      <p>Now take gold. Purify it by dissolving and cementing, as you
        know
        how
        to do. Then dissolve the water of the hand and keep it well
        stoppered
        in
        a glass. When you have all three of these waters, you have an
        earthly
        treasure.
        If you wish to conjoin them, take a glass Recipient, big
        according to
        the
        quantity of your waters, narrow above and wide below. Into this,
        put
        your
        three waters, seal as you know how to do; set it in Balneo, and
        let it
        rise and descend till you see no more spirits rise except a
        watery dew.
        Now take it out, powder it impalpably, put it into a round glass
        with a
        long neck, put it sideways on ashes, in a stove. Then you will
        see an
        evident
        miracle, that is, all the colors God has created in the world,
        before
        the
        perfect White comes; and then the redness from an increase in
        the fire.
        At first, one has to heat mildly, and gradually stronger. But
        when the
        white color appears, you must increase your fire somewhat till
        the
        glass
        becomes glowing. Should something rise, turn the glass over, and
        continue
        with the fire till you see the perfect redness which surpasses
        all the
        redness in the world. Thank God! </p>
      <p>I have done it, but I never reached the end of the Perfection.
        But
        with
        it, you can well make Projection into all metals, because you
        have the
        QE of the Sulfur of the philosophers, and you have subtilized,
        dissolved,
        and spiritualized the Gold. Then its color is increased a
        thousand
        times.
        Also, Mercury has in himself the red color or Tincture in such
        an
        abundance,
        that it cannot be described. Therefore you must yourself
        experiment as
        to what wonderful Projection it makes. I am telling you in true
        charity
        that I and my journeymen never reached the goal of projection.
        That is
        why you must throw it on tin and no other metal. You may also
        dissolve
        your Medicine into a Massa, and carry it about with you, so that
        you
        can
        take the powder out of the glass, stir it into wax; and you can
        throw
        it
        upon whatever you wish, and close your mouth, by the damnation
        of your
        soul. Amen. </p>

        to how they are needed and how one wishes to work with them.
        There are
        many kinds of preparation of the Salts, for in the power of the
        salts
        and
        their Preparation lies the whole Art of Alchymie. One cannot
        work with
        any salt unless the Spiritus has first been separated from the
        Corpus.
        After this, the Spiritus must be prepared according to the work
        in
        which
        it is needed. In addition, the Corpus must also be prepared in
        other
        works,
        because the Spiritus and the Corpus each have its particular
        power and
        cause contrary effects, as they are in fact Contrair, and, when
        they
        are
        separated, effect contrary Operationes, each in its own area.
        But those
        who try to operate with non-separated salts will work in vain,
        in spite
        of all their labors. They cheat themselves and all those who
        believe
        them.
        Neither will they achieve any kind of Perfection, for the whole
        Art
        consists
        in the separation of the salt and the preparation of Sulphur.
        There are
        many kinds of preparation, the same with Sulphur, according to
        what
        works
        are being done. The simpletons, who read in our books about
        Sulphur,
        believe
        that we are speaking of the sulphur which is dug up out of the
        earth;
        but
        we all have another Sulphur in mind. </p>
      <p>There do not exist so many kinds of salt that there should not
        be
        as
        many kinds of Sulphurs and their preparation. The Sulphur must
        be made
        artificially, just as * is made artificially. Now we will again
        return
        to our matter. First I taught you how to separate the Spiritus
        from the
        Corpus. Now I shall instruct you how to prepare the Spiritus,
        and to
        make
        it fixed, and also what you should do with it. </p>
      <p>After you have removed the little skin, which is the Spiritus
        of
        the
        salt, and you have gathered as many of them as possible,
        dissolve them
        again in distilled rain water, the same in which you had
        dissolved your
        salt, Then congeal it again in a glass, or a glass vessel, over
        a
        gentle
        fire. Pulverize it in a stone mortar; add powdered *, mix them
        well.
        Put
        it into a glass with a long neck, lute well, put it to dissolve
        in
        horse
        manure or in the balneum. The glass must be well closed above,
        or put a
        helm on with a recipient, everything well luted. Should any
        moisture
        come
        over, it will coagulate more easily if there is also an
        Alembicum
        attached
        to it than if it were only badly stoppered. This solution and
        coagulation
        in Balneo must be repeated 10 or 12 times, or more, till it is
        fixed.
        Each
        time it has to be coagulated over gentle heat. When it is fixed,
        the
        salt
        is clear and transparent, like crystal and hard. If it is put on
        fire
        or
        on a glowing Lamel, it does not smoke or melt away, and
        penetrate like
        lard through leather; and that is its proof that it is fixed.
        Now the
        Spiritus
        Salis is prepared, and it has also made the * fixed together
        with
        itself;
        and they married and will never again be separated, but stay
        together
        and
        effect wonderful things together. </p>
      <p>Put 1 lb of this salt into a Crucible and 4 lb of mercury
        purified
        with
        vinegar. Add also the salt below, but most of it above; set for
        6 hours
        in the fire, and it will coagulate into true silver; your salt
        will
        neither
        be decreased nor worsened. It does not burn, neither does it fly
        away.
        Now put your silver upon the Cupel, as above. </p>
      <p>If now you wish to bring tin to perfection, purify it first of
        its
        blackness.
        Use Amalgamation or calcination, and purify each time with
        vinegar and
        salt, till there is no more blackness in it. After that, drive
        the
        mercury
        from it, per Descendum, into another vessel. Now take the powder
        Jovis
        and Sal Fixum, put them into a crucible, as before, and let them
        drive
        for 6 hours; or pour the salt into it beforehand and let it
        drive.
        Afterwards
        add the powder Jovis, or both together. It is the same; I tried
        both.
        When
        it cools down, you find Jovem amid the salt. He is noble and a
        King.
        Sweeten
        the salt thereof and preserve it, because it is just as good. </p>
      <p>Now finish your tin on the test furnace or cupel with lead and
        drive
        it off, and you will find good silver in all tests. Aside from
        this,
        know
        that the Corpus of the common slat of which the Spiritus has
        been
        separated,
        is fixed in itself. It is prepared in the following way with Sal
        Alcali,
        Oleo Tartari, Alumen de Roche and Marcasita, that is: </p>
      <p>Of this salt, take 4 lb; of Sal Alcali, Alum de Roche ana, 1
        lb;
        Marcasita,
        1 lb. Pulverize them fine, then pound them together on a stone
        with
        Oleum
        Tartari, and make of them a thick paste. Put it into a glass
        vessel or
        a Syburg jar; lute it tightly and put it under the cookstove,
        where you
        keep a fire going every day. Let it dry; when it is dry, remove
        it and
        pound it once more on a stone with Oleum Tartari. Put it back
        into the
        jar, close it tightly, and put it again in the fireplace to dry,
        as
        before.
        Repeat this till the powder has imbibed the Oleum Tartari and
        you have
        a dry Massa. Powder this massa to a fine dust in a mortar, put
        it into
        a Syburg jar, lute it tightly all around, 3 or 4 thumbs breadth.
        Put it
        3 or 4 times into a potter’s stove; break the jar open, and you
        will
        find
        it white. </p>
      <p>Take it out and turn it into a fine powder in a mortar; let it
        dissolve
        in the cellar on a marble slate with a glass beneath it into
        which it
        can
        drip. Wit this water, one can do many wonderful things in the
        Art. Wit
        it one can dissolve mercury into a beautiful transparent water;
        when
        mercury
        is dissolved with it or in it, one can dissolve all 7 metals <br>
        Into pure water with it or in it. And this is the right
        preparation
        of the common slat, and it is the Key on the little finger,
        because the
        little finger is the Key to the Hand. </p>

        <p><b>How to Turn All Metals into Water</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Now we will teach you how to turn all metals into water, since
        all
        of
        them must previously have been water before they can be brought
        to
        Perfection.
        Purify the Mercury of its blackness, and purify it well without
        vinegar.
        Afterwards, dissolve it again in the aforementioned water, and
        you can
        dissolve in it any metal you wish. When it is dissolved, take
        sweet,
        fresh
        cheese curds. Boil them and skim the thick Materi off; let it
        settle.
        Separate
        from it what stays pure. Pour some of it into that which you
        have
        dissolved,
        and it will Precipitate into a Massa. Separate the water from
        the
        Massa.
        After this you must cleanse it of its blackness with salt and
        vinegar,
        and continue to work according to what purpose you wish to have
        the
        metals,
        to the Red or to the White, as different works indicate. But all
        metals
        must be water and purified of their blackness if one is to bring
        them
        to
        Perfection, or the great Elixir must do it: It has the power and
        nothing
        else. </p>
      <p>Now I will teach you how to add the Spiritus to the Corpus that
        you
        have prepared, that is, in what way you must Conjoin them. When
        now the
        Spiritus and the Corpus come together and are united after their
        preparation,
        one can do wonderful things with them, since they have then a
        hundred
        times
        more power than they had previously; for after the Conjunctio of
        the
        soul
        and the body there exists a Glorified Corpus and a great Elixir.
        With
        it
        one performs great miracles. </p>
      <p>First one cleanse Mercury of its blackness. After this, one
        must
        also
        dissolve in this water, Luna, which comes dry from the test
        furnace.
        Now
        take Marcasita Lunae; turn it into an impalpable powder and
        pound it
        well
        with salt and vinegar, washing it till no more blackness comes
        off. Now
        dry the powder at the sun, and afterwards grind it with good
        Aqua
        Vitae.
        Take * water. Then draw the water off per Alembicum, and
        immediately
        dissolve
        the powder again in the same water. Now take the water in which
        these
        three
        dissolved, and as much fixed Spiritus as the weight of the water
        in
        which
        the metals have been dissolved. Imbibe these spirits into this
        water,
        pound
        them, dry them, and imbibe them again; coagulate them again in
        the air,
        for it is the cold air that must coagulate them and the hot air
        must
        dissolve
        them. </p>
      <p>Listen well to these discourses, how they are meant; it would
        take
        too
        long to elaborate further. Neither is it necessary for this
        work. When
        all this water has been imbibed, you have a precious Stone with
        great
        power
        to act upon Mercury and Mars. It can also be prepared for the
        Red, but
        that is not necessary; for when they prepare the aforementioned
        finger,
        they are making a great elixir. Should one work it to the Red,
        it would
        increase in power a thousandfold through the preparation. And
        this is
        one
        of the secret signs, and it is the little finger of the hand,
        which is
        the key of the Hand. </p>

      <p>This is man and woman, this is sister and brother, this is

        no work can be accomplished, for without seed no fruit can be

        without seed no fruit can be born, and without soil no seed can

        there has to be man and woman, water and earth, fire and seed,
        if any
        fruit
        is to be obtained. Thus these two are the origin of all metals,
        and
        without
        them no work can be brought to Completion. </p>
      <p>Now I will further instruct my child and describe the nature of
        Mercury
        and his infirmities, and in what way he is to be made healthy.
        Therefore,
        understand well what I say, for by means of this work I will
        teach you
        all other Opera, for all metals. </p>
      <p>Mercury is a spirit and also a Corpus, but the spirit is
        evident
        and
        the Corpus hidden and intangible. This is due to the Spiritus
        with
        which
        the body is covered, for the spirit is more powerful than the
        body.
        That
        is why the Spiritus takes the Corpus along when it gets into the
        fire.
        Mercury is cold and humid, cold in the manifested and cold in
        his
        humidity;
        but in his innermost and in his hidden nature he is red, which
        is hot
        and
        dry. That is why the old masters called him an egg, because an
        egg is
        white,
        cold and humid outside, and within it is hot and dry; and when
        an egg
        is
        put in the fire, it will evaporate and burst. That is due to its
        humidity
        and cold. This is the reason why they call him the philosophers’
        egg,
        which
        people do not understand. Because of the coldness that he has in
        himself,
        he avoids fire; for two unlike things of a contrary nature
        cannot stand
        each other; one or the other must go. Because his Spiritus is
        stronger
        than his Corpus, the Spiritus leads the Corpus away from the
        fire. Now
        I immediately also show the virtues of Mercury. </p>
      <p>Mercury is a slimy water in the earth, a subtle substance, an
        earth
        spirit. He is the same subtlety which the earth has in itself.
        That is
        why it is called Arsenicum of the earth. Therefore it has the
        power to
        produce fruit without the help of the earth; that is, he can
        perform
        works
        without any other thing, because the spirit of the earth and the
        spirit
        of a thing have the power to do a great deal without the help of
        the
        Corpus.
        But the Corpus has no power to do anything without the help of
        the
        spirit.
        By this understand well what I have in mind concerning mercury,
        though
        Mercury may well be changed into gold or silver without the help
        of the
        metals. That is why the old folks called him the Serpent that
        begets
        itself
        and gives birth without the help of some metals. Yet people do
        not
        understand
        this saying about the snake, because they do not know Mercury. </p>
      <p>I have said that Mercury is a slimy water, of a white color,
        soft,
        natural,
        joined from within hot dryness and from without with cold
        humidity,
        more
        than with inner hot dryness; that is why he does not like the
        fire! </p>
      <p>Mercury is the Ferment, the yeast, or the sourdough, for yeast
        causes
        the bread or beverage to rise and to go over, and it gives them
        their
        taste.
        Therefore mercury must be in all works like yeast, for without
        Mercury
        no work can be accomplished. Mercury is the beginning, the
        middle, and
        the end. He is the Copulator, the priest who brings all things
        together
        and marries them; because no fruit can come from like things;
        but
        unlike
        things, of two unlike natures, must be united. It is, however,
        not easy
        to unite unlike things. Thus, Mercury must gather all unlike
        things and
        marry them, if they are to bring forth fruit; for Mercury is in
        them as
        the universal Spirit, for he is the humidity of all things, also
        of the
        earth; just as blood is the Spiritus, humidity and life of men,
        Mercury
        is the life of the earth. </p>
      <p>Therefore, all things that have got their nature from the earth
        are
        subject to him; also all that which the earth brings forth or
        has
        brought
        forth. That is why it is said that mercury is the Spiritus of
        all
        things.
        Because of this the old philosophers say that in Mercury there
        are four
        kinds of saline juices, for all salts are made of four things,
        each
        contrary
        to the other. That is why all salts are poisonous, but one more
        so than
        another. </p>
      <p>The old masters called Mercury ‘Virgin’s Milk’, because Mercury
        is
        nourishment,
        food, and the dwelling place of all metals, since he enters and
        passes
        through all metals, just as mother’s milk passes through all
        members of
        the child and nourishes them. Mercury is the Nutriment and
        mother of
        all
        metals; Mercury makes all hot Corpora cold, and all dry bodies
        moist;
        he
        also makes all hot Corpora cold, and all dry bodies moist; he
        also
        makes
        all cold bodies hot, and all humid Corpora dry. However, Mercury
        has to
        be transmuted into another degree, according to what the work
        is, that
        one wishes to accomplish with him. For Mercury has a wonderful
        nature.
        Wherever he is added or used, he is the best or the worst,
        depending on
        how the company is. </p>
      <p>Thus one may use Mercury for whatever work one wishes to
        perform.
        If
        he is congealed, he continues to congeal; if he is dissolved, he
        dissolves
        further; if he is fixed, he fixes further; if he is multiplied,
        he
        likewise
        continues to multiply; if he is made poisonous, he poisons
        everything. </p>
      <p>Thus have I taught and shown you what derives from mercury and
        what
        he is. I have informed you of part of his infirmities as well as
        of
        part
        of his wonderful nature. Now I will teach you part of his virtue
        and
        power
        and of the works he can do, from degree to degree, to his
        utmost,
        according
        to the understanding which Almighty God has granted to me
        through his
        bottomless
        charity. Although one could not write all his degrees and powers
        in a
        book
        as big as the Bible, I will now here teach my knowledge obtained
        through
        the charity of Gold Almighty, and what I know, have learned and
        experienced
        in this matter. </p>
      <p>First, what he can do when he comes raw from the mines.
        Subsequently,
        what he can accomplish when he is a great Sublimate; and then,
        what his
        capability is when he is congealed and dissolved, and, in
        addition, how
        to understand this. Finally, I shall make you acquainted with
        his
        sister
        and brother; and also how to make the Sulfur, by which Mercury
        must be
        brought into a state of health. </p>
      <p>First I will say what mercury can do inside and outside the
        earth,
        when
        he is still raw. I said that Mercury is the Spiritus of the
        earth;
        likewise
        he is the Sperma of the earth, and the seed of all metals. Of
        this
        seed,
        when planted in the earth, that is the Sulfur --- be it pure or
        impure,
        red or white --- one of the seven metals is generated. </p>
      <p>Consequently, Mercury is the beginning and the foundation of
        all
        seven
        metals. His intention is always to generate gold or silver, but
        he is
        impeded
        by the lazy and impure earth or Sulfur, so that he cannot
        achieve his
        purpose,
        while it is also true that the stench of the earth hinders him
        often to
        do so. For as a child in the womb is made impure by the Materi
        which it
        attracts --- as the child may get a disease on account of the
        uncleanliness
        and Corruption of the place where it lies, which causes it to
        get such
        a disease; irrespective of the fact that the Sperma and seed
        were pure
        and clean, the child is nevertheless afflicted with an
        uncleanliness;
        it
        is due to the lazy mother and the Corruption befalling it --- so
        it is
        with the metals which are likewise corrupted by the impure
        Sulphur. </p>
      <p>After this, I will say and teach whether God has created all
        things
        of one or of two natures, and how, and what. God has put
        together and
        united
        all things of four contrary elements. He has put them together
        with
        their
        opposites; but these natures are perfectly united in all things,
        regardless
        if they are perfect or imperfect. Thus we find that either the
        manifest
        part in a thing is perfect, or the concealed part. But while
        they are
        cold
        it is the contrary. That is why it is easy to change the Corpora
        into
        their
        prime root in a short time, so that the concealed part can be
        made
        manifest,
        and the manifest pert in nature can be hidden in the metals. For
        what
        iron
        lacks in its manifest form, is replaced by something in its
        hidden form
        during its transformation into gold or silver. Its hidden part
        is
        mercury,
        which replaces iron during its transformation. </p>
      <p>If, therefore, iron is changed into Mercury, its hidden part
        will
        become
        hot and dry, and its visible part, cold and moist. Bring its
        hidden
        part
        into manifestation, therefore, and make its visible part hidden.
        Then
        its
        hidden part will be cold and dry, and its manifest part, hot and
        moist;
        now it is perfect and will last in all eternity. </p>
      <p>There were some who said that it was the hidden Saturn and
        Jupiter;
        others said Luna; and in this they spoke the truth. I am saying
        all
        this
        to show how all Corpora must be transformed; for in all bodies
        two
        manifest
        natures must be hidden, and two hidden natures must be made
        manifest.
        What
        is manifest, is imperfect and full of sickness; and what is
        hidden in
        the
        metals is fixed, good, and perfect by nature. That is why you
        must make
        its hidden part manifest, and its manifest hidden. Then you have
        a
        pure,
        perfect, and fixed Corpus, lasting in all eternity. It is a
        great
        secret
        to have the understanding of this, and to know the Secreta as
        also the
        infirmities of the metals, and in what way the metals came by
        them;
        apart
        from this, (it is also a great secret) to well know their
        natures,
        within
        and without, hot and dry, cold and humid, over and again back.
        It is
        the
        fire that I have in mind. </p>
      <p>You can make them healthy again with natural medicine and with
        Sulfur,
        which I will teach you later how to make from green herbs, oils,
        gums,
        and water. Concerning this, you must well understand my view,
        since in
        this chapter you are being acquainted with all the infirmities
        of the
        metals,
        and you will be taught to recognize all herbs, to prepare all
        Sulphura,
        and to know all medicines. You will learn what they require in
        their
        bodies,
        so that you will learn how to make manifest one of the hidden
        elements,
        and how to make its contrary hidden. Understand well that I
        indicate
        all
        this, so that you should know nature. For lead is cold and dry,
        its
        manifest
        nature is quite soft, and its hidden part is hot and humid. </p>
      <p>In all things that God the Lord has created, the hidden part is
        always
        contrary to the manifest part, in softness as well as in
        hardness; for
        the soft is the Contrarium of the hard, that is, when its nature
        is
        reversed,
        its hidden part becomes manifest, and its manifest becomes
        concealed;
        that
        is, the soft has to become hard, and the hard, soft. This is
        meant for
        the Corpora lead, tin and iron. They are also composed of four
        natures,
        since the manifest of lead is cold, humid, and soft, while its
        hidden
        part
        is hot, dry, and hard. Likewise with iron. When they made him
        like
        lead,
        they called him lead; but its hidden part is iron, and the
        former is
        manifest.
        And when you reverse the hidden Saturn and make it manifest, it
        is
        Mars.
        Such is easy to do with Sulfur, and then it is Luna, lasting in
        all
        eternity. </p>
      <p>The body of iron is composed of four natures whose exterior is
        hot,
        dry and hard, while the hidden part in its nature is cold,
        humid, and
        soft,
        like lead in its root. In no Corpus is there as great a hardness
        as in
        the manifest Mars, and in its hidden part there is an equally
        great
        softness.
        One becomes easily aware of its softness when it is prepared and
        reversed.
        After this operation it is Mercury. </p>
      <p>The hidden part of Mercury is Mars; its manifest part is a cold
        dry
        water called Mercury. That is why his manifest part must be
        hidden and
        his hidden part made manifest. Thus he can be converted into
        fine gold;
        or, if you wish, increase his color, and his coldness will
        appear and
        become
        silver; or increase his heat and humidity, and it will become
        gold.
        Understand
        well what I say, what I intend to convey. Reflect on what I have
        taught
        you and how I have compared Mercury to an egg, which is white
        outside
        and
        red inside. Thus is Mercury in the center of his nature.
        Therefore,
        understand
        these teachings well. Enough of this. </p>
      <p>Sol is hot and humid in its manifest part; dry, melancholy and
        like
        lead in its hidden part. Therefore, reverse all Corpora into
        this
        nature,
        for this nature is temperate. If you wish to cook Mercury till
        he
        becomes
        silver, and till he becomes gold, prepare your yellow-colored
        Sulphura
        that can tinct, and decrease his humidity till he becomes hot
        and dry.
        Then his humidity will be saturated and decreased, which means,
        to
        reverse
        his hidden part and root, which is gold, and his color, which is
        solar,
        into Sol. Take my discourses to heart, listen and pay careful
        attention
        to them. </p>
      <p>Venus is hot and dry, and is a brother of Mars, for his root is
        hot
        and humid like gold, and he is different from him in dryness of
        his
        Minera,
        which has become impure. Take of him his dryness, and prepare it
        with
        contrary
        Sulphura that are good and healthy for him. Then he will again
        get back
        into his nature and will turn into gold. Understand my
        discourses well,
        and pay careful attention to what I intend to teach you. It is
        of great
        importance and secrecy what I am telling you; it is also a great
        secret
        and deep wisdom. Therefore do take my discourses carefully to
        heart. </p>
      <p>Mercury is cold and humid in his manifest part, driving and
        soft
        as
        water; and in his hidden part he is he hot, dry, and hard
        without any
        doubt;
        for his manifest part is Mercury, and his hidden part Mars and
        the
        contrary.
        Now then, if we wish to reverse mercury into his first water,
        the way
        to
        do it is first to turn him into silver through Sulphur which
        helps him,
        that is, his brother and is sister. Understand my discourses:
        You must
        hide his humidity and reveal his dryness through Sulphur. Then
        it will
        become good silver. Such is the first way. </p>
      <p>Understand my teachings well, and if you wish to perfect the
        work,
        reverse
        silver so slowly till its manifest part becomes hidden and its
        hidden
        part,
        on the contrary, manifest. Understand well, these are two ways,
        active
        and passive. Then its hidden part will be hot and humid, that is
        gold;
        and its manifest part, cold and dry, that is Saturnus. Do take
        care to
        understand my teachings well. I am addressing you in bad German,
        without
        veiled word. Know that silver is the root of gold. Therefore, if
        you
        wish
        to change it into gold, conceal its coldness. Then its heat will
        manifest.
        After this, cover up the dryness, and its humidity will
        manifest; and
        it
        will be good gold, everlasting. </p>
      <p>Thus I have informed you of and made known to you the nature of
        metals
        and their infirmities; and how one is to reverse those and
        prepare them
        with each metal’s Sulphur; that is, according to what is the
        infirmity
        of a metal, prepare your Sulphur, as I will teach you. </p>
      <p>Item, when Mercury comes out of the mines, it is living water,
        with
        which we must wash all our Sulphura, metals, and Corpora; and
        make all
        our Corpora humid. This means that all their Corpora must be
        amalgamated
        and dissolved with mercury, and Mercury must turn all hard
        Corpora into
        water or softness. Then one can pound and wash all metals with
        sea salt
        or distilled vinegar. This is to be done in a marble or stone
        mortar,
        and
        it has to be made so clean that no muddiness is left. When the
        Corpora
        are quite clean, drive the Mercury off per Distillationem. Now
        you can
        prepare the powder with the Sulphur, which I will hereafter
        teach you
        how
        to prepare. </p>
      <p>Now I will further teach you how it is that Mercury becomes so
        poisonous
        during sublimation. The reason is that it is his nature to
        attract to
        himself
        all the poison he can get at. If he meets good metals, he wants
        to be
        the
        best; if he meets bad metals, the worst, etc. This is the reason
        why
        Mercury
        attracts to himself all poison when he is sublimated through hot
        natures;
        for all hot herbs, salts, and all other things created by God
        that are
        hot to the 4th degree, are poisonous. I would like to inform you
        of the
        reasons, but this work does not require my doing so. Therefore,
        if he
        were
        to be sublimated through hot salts and hot Species, he would
        become
        poisonous;
        for all salts are poisonous, one more than another; therefore,
        the more
        he is sublimated through them, the more poisonous he becomes.
        One could
        sublimate so often through Vitriolum Romanum, or Vitriolum
        Album, or
        alum,
        Sal Gemmae, Saltpetre, etc. that he would become so poisonous
        that,
        should
        he be put on a saddle upon which a man were riding, that man
        would
        immediately
        die as soon as his bottom got warm on it. But the salts must
        previously
        be dissolved 9 times in distilled wine vinegar, and again
        congealed.
        And
        if Mercury were then sublimated 30 times through it, he has the
        power
        to
        accomplish such feats, and he would stand the test. </p>
      <p>It is not necessary, however, to bring Mercury thus to
        Perfection,
        since
        it is dangerous to do it on account of the poison, for if the
        pot got
        cracked,
        it would be dangerous for those who do not know him; since one
        must
        heat
        so strongly that the salts come in flux before Mercury will
        evaporate
        from
        them. Afterwards he does not completely rise but stays below in
        the
        vessel
        to cook with the salts. Yet to do this one has to sublimate him
        40
        times.
        I have done it myself with my own hands, and afterwards drove
        off 20 lb
        in a test, and I did not lose one pound of it. </p>
      <p>I do not, however, advise you to do this because of the worries
        one
        has with it, since the last times one has to give such strong
        heat as I
        indicated. Also, there are many ways that are easier to bring
        Mercury
        to
        Perfection with Sulphur; I only wish to show you his powers, for
        when
        he
        is thus sublimated, one can perform miraculous things with him.
        It
        would
        be a pity if some people knew about it and understood it, as
        they would
        then perform miracles with him. That is why I cannot write to
        you about
        all his powers which I know and which I have tried, but I will
        relate
        part
        of what he can do when he is sublimated. </p>
      <p>It is known that in the Art of Alchymia there is much fraud,
        and
        many
        imitations of gold and silver are made which are supposed to
        stand
        three
        or four tests; and yet they are finally false. If you should
        have any
        doubts
        concerning this, take some powder of the sublimated Mercury; put
        some
        of
        the gold or silver about which you have your doubts into a
        crucible,
        and
        melt it; throw your powder on it, and it will immediately reveal
        its
        nature;
        if it is false, it will get back to its first nature as soon as
        it
        melts.
        But if it is good, it will stay good. Throw the same powder on a
        stone;
        if it is false, it will immediately break into a hundred pieces,
        like
        salt. </p>
      <p>Dissolve tin and silver together ana; put it in a test with
        Saturnus
        and throw this powder on it. It will drive as if there were no
        tin in
        it,
        and it will be of great benefit, as I have tested myself. If you
        have
        silver
        that is not malleable, throw this powder on it, and it will
        become
        malleable
        like fine silver; throw it on iron or steel, and it will become
        malleable
        and soft like lead; and one can test all things with it. </p>
      <p>Now then, all Sublimationes Mercurii are beneficial to his
        recovering
        his health, provided he is sublimated through hot, dry things.
        Likewise,
        all Congelationes are good for him, because all things that
        congeal
        mercury,
        be it green herbs or salts, or tin, or lead, or gums, or smoke,
        or
        sulphur,
        etc., are absolutely curative or healthy for him, and one should
        congeal
        him so long that he can stand in the fire. </p>
      <p>There may well be more direct ways with sulphur; but when
        Mercury
        is
        congealed, he has powers and effects which he does not have when
        he is
        sublimated. It is not necessary, however, to relate them in
        connection
        with this work. When Mercury is dissolved, he does other
        wonderful
        works,
        and one does with him what one wishes; for when he is dissolved,
        he
        dissolves
        the seven metals. And, what is more, he dissolves all things
        grown out
        of the earth and everything the earth has given birth to, not
        everything
        in the same period of time but one in more time than another.
        Yet in
        time
        mercury dissolves all things, also with the help of other
        Species that
        are added to him. </p>
      <p>Thus Mercury is the Lord and Spiritus of all things, for he
        shuns
        nobody
        and nothing in the world created by God Almighty, except fire.
        But with
        the help of the precious Sulphura, which the sages have invented
        and
        made
        by the Grace of God, and after they have well considered all
        powers and
        degrees of Mercury, as well as his infirmities and the causes
        thereof,
        and what he is, the masters have prepared a medicine for him;
        that is,
        a precious Sulphur made of many hot herbs and other Species
        which they
        used for it; and they have cooked and fried him so long that he
        could
        get
        into the fire and stand it. I will teach you yet how to make it.
      </p>
      <p>Take small pearls, dissolve them with mercury --- all of them
        have
        to
        turn into water. Now pour on them fresh cheese curds, as I have
        taught
        you in the Key. The Materi of the pearls will precipitate to the
        bottom.
        Wash it clean till all the Aqua Fort is off, and you have a
        viscous
        oil.
        Of that you can make pearls as big or small as you wish. </p>
      <p>Have the form made of silver, gilt inside. Put it into the
        blood
        of
        a buck, mixed with nightshade water, in which they will become
        as hard
        as they were before; and they will get such a pure luster that
        is more
        marvelous than that of all other pearls; for during the solution
        they
        become
        so clean of all spots, so purely oriental, that no uncleanliness
        whatsoever
        stays in them. The same happens to all other precious stones
        dissolved
        in this oil. </p>
      <p>Item, in the second instance you may take crystal and dissolve
        it.
        Then
        take the tincture which I have taught you to prepare from
        Vitriol
        Romanum,
        in the foremost finger of the hand, upon which stands the star.
        Dissolve
        it in water together with the crystal, and conjoin them in the
        same way
        as you did with the pearls. Form them big or small according to
        your
        wishes,
        make them hard like pearls, polish them with Oil of Birchwood
        made per
        Descensum. With that oil all man-made stones have to be
        polished, and
        whenever
        they are polished, the oil has to be spread on lead. After being
        polished,
        the stone is like a beautiful, precious ruby, looking as if it
        were
        worth
        100 crowns. Nobody can distinguish it from a ruby, unless it
        were
        subjected
        to the highest test; but there are not many people who know how
        to do
        that,
        yes, hardly one in a region. </p>
      <p>Thus you can counterfeit all kinds of stones from crystal and
        give
        them
        the coloring you wish the stone to have, but the tinctures and
        colors
        must
        be dissolved with the crystal in the manner I have taught you
        concerning
        the ruby. All kinds of glass can be dissolved in this way, like
        crystal,
        red, blue, yellow, green; glass of all sorts. I have seen
        wonders made
        of it, wonderful things made of glass and crystal, which great
        Lords
        possessed
        and considered more highly than fine gold. They were formed with
        foreign
        animals and wonderful. They were considered precious stones and
        were
        set
        on feet; also on exquisite bowls, on treasure chests; and nobody
        knew
        what
        they were, except those who know how to make the supreme test of
        everything. </p>
      <p>One can also take little pieces of rubies, or sand, or other
        stones,
        (no matter which), dissolve them in the aforementioned manner,
        form and
        harden them as said above. They will become as hard as before,
        but much
        purer and more beautiful. for nothing impure remains in them.
        And in
        this
        there is no fraud, because they can stand the highest test; and
        one
        does
        indeed find enough little pieces of precious stone, and
        therefore it is
        not necessary to accept or make imperfect tones. </p>
      <p>But this is enough now of rocks. One does indeed make many
        wonderful
        things from Mercury after it is dissolved, so that it would be a
        pity
        if
        many a man knew about it. </p>
      <p>Item, all metals that one wishes to bring to Perfection must be
        dissolved
        in Mercury, otherwise it is sheer fraud. Then they must be
        cooked with
        Sulphur; but you have to prepare the Sulphur according to
        whether the
        metals
        are healthy. Understand me well! I will teach you the Sulphur
        with
        which
        you must make Mercury healthy, and in connection with this
        Sulphur I
        will
        teach you how to prepare all other Sulphura. </p>
      <p>Mercury is cold and humid in his outward nature, and in his
        innermost
        he is hot and dry. Reverse him, therefore, and he will become
        healthy.
        Consequently, one should remove from him his cold humidity. This
        must
        be
        done with hot herbs or oils of which you must make the Sulphur.
      </p>
      <p>Take Alum de Roche, calcine it as is customary. Now take the
        peels
        of
        bitter oranges. Put them into a glass vessel, pour good
        distilled wine
        vinegar upon them, boil them till all the vinegar is boiled away
        and
        the
        powder is quite dry. Add this powder to the said powder of alum,
        together
        with three oak apples that are pointed; pulverize them. Then
        take sloe
        herb, pound it quite fine, and force it through a cloth with
        good
        distilled
        vinegar; pound it again till all of it all of it has gone
        through the
        cloth
        together with the vinegar. Now dry it in a bowl and let it dry
        in the
        sun.
        You will now have a fine powder which you should add to the
        other. </p>
      <p>Now take cinquefoil and treat it like you did the celidonia.
        Add
        it
        to the other powder, and the more hot herbs you gather, the
        better you
        can get Mercury to die. Now take all these powders pounded
        finely
        together;
        put them on a grinding stone, imbibe them with pig’s gall ---
        that’s
        the
        best --- let it dry till you can pulverize it again. </p>
      <p>Add to this dried human blood, the blood of roosters or hens;
        imbibe
        them together with animal gall as before, and let them dry
        together on
        a glass slab. Do this 8 or 9 times, the more the better; and
        finally
        let
        it become quite hard and dry, so that it can be turned into a
        fine
        powder. </p>
      <p>Add to this dried human blood, the blood of roosters or hens;
        imbibe
        them together with animal gall as before, and let them dry

        finally
        let
        it become quite hard and dry, so that it can be turned into a
        fine
        powder. </p>
      <p>Now take Roman, red-calcined vitriol, and as much cinnabar as
        the
        vitriol
        weighs. Pulverize them quite finely together, put them into a
        glass,
        pour
        good Aqua Vitae thereon; then distill the Aqua Vitae off per
        Alembicum.
        Repeat the drawing off and pouring 3 or 4 times. </p>
      <p>After this, take the poured off Aqua Vitae of these two
        matters.
        Imbibe
        the powder therein on a grinding stone to the consistency of a
        pulp.
        Let
        it dry again on the glass as above. Do this 12 or 16 times, the
        more
        the
        better. The last time, let it dry hard, so that you can powder
        it in a
        mortar and pound it on a stone. </p>
      <p>Now take Mercurius Sublimatus, or calcinated Mercury, 1 lb; of
        the
        prepared,
        pulverized Sulphur, 1/2 lb. Mix them together and put them into
        a
        Syburg
        jar, well stoppered. Put them where you heat every day, and let
        them
        get
        heated as much as you can, because Mercury will not fly away
        while he
        is
        lying with his brother and sister, arm in arm, mouth to mouth;
        and they
        will surely keep him there, so that he can stand the fire; for
        his
        brother
        is hot and his sister is dry. And they are the hot, dry Species
        of
        which
        the Sulphur is made. This is the Sulphur of the philosophers.
        This is
        the
        same of which the philosophers write, but the ignorant imagine
        that
        they
        mean Sulphur. This Sulphur I have often made. </p>
      <p>Item, one can also make Sulphur of hot, dry oils; or hot, dry
        gums,
        or hot, dry seeds of herbs, but you must always add calcined
        alum.
        Sometimes
        you must add hot and humid, sometimes cold and dry; occasionally
        cold
        and
        humid; at times dry; sometimes hot, sometimes cold, sometimes
        humid,
        according
        to the infirmities of the metals that you wish to reverse
        outside,
        inside.
        Sometimes only one nature must be reversed in a metal; in
        another
        instance,
        two. That is why the Sulphur must often be made in different
        ways,
        because
        there are many kinds of infirmities in the metals. You can also
        transmute
        the metals into another nature and you can do this with Sulphur.
      </p>
      <p>One can also change gold into silver with Sulphur made for that
        purpose.
        Nevertheless, that is contrary to nature, since nature is always
        aiming
        at the best. Nevertheless, it is possible to do it, that is, to
        transfer
        one thing into another nature by means of the Sulphur made
        through the
        Art. Therefore, whoever can transmute gold into the nature of
        silver,
        can
        also translate Luna and all other metals into Sol; for it is
        much
        better
        to do that than to change gold into silver, because nature
        always
        desires
        what is better. This is also the reason why one must prepare the
        Sulphur
        according to the works which one wishes to do with the metals or
        to
        Effect
        upon them. But whatever Sulphur you wish to make, be it hot or
        cold,
        dry
        or moist, you must always have calcined alum. It must be in the
        heat,
        coldness,
        dryness, and humidity of the Sulphura, for alum is the Lantern
        in the
        seven
        metals. </p>
      <p>Let us now deal further with Mercury, who lies shut in the
        stove
        with
        the Sulphura. You must give fire day and night, that is to say,
        on the
        jar; and keep it always hot. Every 14 days you must go over to
        it, take
        out two or four ounces, put it with lead on the cupel and let it
        drive.
        And lo! If it drives on the test, you can take it out, pour
        clean water
        into a bowl, and pour Mercury with the Sulphur into it and stir
        well.
        Now
        mercury will settle down at the bottom, then you must pour off
        the
        water
        with the Sulphur above, into another bowl, 5 or 6 times, till
        the water
        runs off pure and becomes sweet. When all the Sulphur has been
        washed
        off
        it, dry Mercury over the fire, and drive it off on the test, as
        on
        silver,
        and you will find fine silver in all trials. Let the water
        containing
        your
        Sulphur evaporate on fire, and you have your Sulphur back; but
        it has
        been
        somewhat decreased because of the washing. </p>
      <p>This is the first secret sign of the seven secrets. It is
        called
        the
        Fish, which is compared to mercury, and it is the most secret
        sign
        among
        all seven secrets, and it is the beginning, middle, and all
        perfect
        works,
        as I taught you before. I am therefore asking you not to let
        this get
        into
        the hands of the ignorant and sinners. </p>

      <p>If you wish to sublimate Mercury in order to dissolve it, let
        salt
        melt
        in hot water, and let the water stand over it for three hours to
        dissolve
        it. Now pour the water off and congeal it. Through this,
        sublimate
        Mercury
        as often as you wish, each time with fresh Cement; and do not
        take what
        is not dissolved in 3 hors, as it is not good for this work.
        This salt
        is good, although you have not much * with it. It will probably
        dissolve
        when it is calcined as it should be. When this mercury no longer
        shines,
        it is sufficiently sublimated and pure; and the test is when he
        no
        longer
        blackens, although he is putrefied. </p>
      <p>Item this test: Put gold on a glass slab, and if everything
        together
        dissolves so that no Faeces remain, it may well be putrefied;
        but it
        must
        first be congealed before it is put on the slab and putrefied.
        If any
        Faeces
        remain, put it back into Putrefaction and feed it, and see if it
        does
        not
        require more; and you will feel that when the little pieces stay
        inside
        whole and no longer dissolve. Then congeal your Materi, which is

        soil, without holes, so that the furnace is well covered, as
        this
        illustration
        shows. On this floor raise the wall; but first put on the floor,
        four
        iron
        supports like a tripod. On top there has to be a vessel. These
        supports
        together with the vessel must not touch the wall of the furnace.
        In
        addition,
        there has to be another tripod inside the vessel or test, as
        also a
        small
        vessel upon which one could put a glass or other bowl. This
        small
        vessel
        must be made of wood. </p>
      <p>If then one wishes to dissolve the Spiritus or other things,
        water
        has
        to be put into the lower and upper vessels. The glass has to be
        left
        open,
        to allow the humid, subtle air to get inside. Now put a gentle
        little
        fire
        under the furnace, because it must&nbsp; not be warmer than it
        is
        usually
        in a warm room. Thus the matter will be dissolved by the steam
        of the
        water. </p>
      <p>But if you wish to congeal, calcine or fix, you must put no
        water
        into
        the vessels but keep your work quite dry with the aforementioned
        heat.
        That is why the furnace must have a lid or cover above, which
        must be
        so
        wide that you can take it off if necessary. In addition, there
        should
        be
        a little door in the cover, so that you can put your hand inside
        and
        test
        the warmth, just as with the same heat all humid spirits are
        fixed.
        Will
        you please have a good look at the illustration. </p>
      <p>Aside from this, there is still another furnace in which many
        kinds
        of things can simultaneously be cooked or done, as in ashes or
        in sand,
        in Balneo, or in Ventre Equino. This means, that if someone
        would like
        to putrefy something which would otherwise have to be put in
        horse’s
        dung,
        one would put hay or dung into the cupel and water it somewhat.
        Then it
        is just as good as if it were standing in horse’s dung. </p>

        <p><b>It Now Follows How One is to Make or Use the Furnace</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>First, the lower part has to be made, so as to get the ashes.
        Then
        follows
        the grill which must be just in the center, a good bit narrower
        than
        the
        furnace. The furnace has to be made higher yet, but not narrower
        than
        it
        is below. On one side there has to be a small door, so as to
        allow the
        hanging lamp, and below, the coal to pass through. Afterwards
        the
        furnace
        must be made higher again and wider, with a thin wall. A few air
        holes
        must be made on one side, which can be opened and closed at
        will. After
        this, it must be closed and vaulted, well-fitting, with four
        round air
        holes with a lid on each of them. They must be separated by four
        equal
        little walls. </p>
      <p>After this, the furnace must be made higher on the sides; it
        must
        have
        four doors on the four sides that close tightly so that, of one
        wishes
        to remove the lid from a hole, one can put one’s hand through
        it. When
        all this has been done, take four copper kettles, or other
        vessels
        burnt
        of clay, or something else. They must be walled in on the four
        parts of
        the furnace, one on each side. Next to each cupel, there must be
        an
        airhole
        with a well-fitting stopper in order to regulate the heat. In
        the first
        cupel or kettle there must be sand to make fixation in it. In
        the
        second
        there must be dung or moist hay, to putrefy in it. In the third,
        one
        can
        keep ashes, to distill on them. In the fourth, should be the
        water bath
        Balneum Mariae, also to distill and putrefy. </p>
      <p>When all this is ready, one can put coal on the grill, or a
        hanging
        lamp. The four lids have to all be taken off; or, if one wishes
        one to
        be hotter than the other, one should remove that one lid and
        shut the
        little
        door tightly. One must also have pointed and high lids, burnt of
        clay,
        on the glasses in which one wishes to putrefy and fix. They must
        cover
        the glasses all around and close them tightly, and one must be
        able to
        take them off, as may be seen by the illustration. </p>

      <center>
        <p><b>Operatio Tartari, or the Work of Tartar</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This is the way to prepare Tartarum. It is very good and has
        the
        four
        elements in it, but not like other things, Species and herbs. </p>
      <p>In all the things that God Almighty has created out of the four
        elements,
        the elements are befouled and impure, and they cannot be
        purified
        otherwise
        than by distilling, sublimating, calcining, cementing, etc. In
        that way
        the elements can be cleansed wit hard work. One cannot find
        anything in
        the world that is like tartar, because God has not left any
        impurity in
        it, since it separates from wine of its own, like water from
        fire; and
        tartar does not take on any impurity from wine, just as water
        does not
        from fire; but if there is any impurity in the water, it will
        leave it
        in the fire, so that the fire may burn and destroy it. For fire
        consumes
        every impurity, and all impurities of the elements must be
        purified b
        fire.
        Nevertheless, fire is in itself frail in that it is not fixed;
        for when
        God corrupted the four elements, it also corrupted the fire.
        That is
        why
        the fire is not fixed. </p>
      <p>Tartarum, however, is a fire without air and without a flame,
        fixed
        and pure. That is why no one can separate the element from
        Tartarum,
        since
        it is a glorified Corpus. Nothing can destroy Tartarum, nor can
        fire
        burn
        it. Tartar is the fixed fire of which we often write in our
        books. Fire
        has the power to purify all corrupted elements and to burn and
        consume
        all impurities, also to make all other elements fixed. What will
        this
        one
        not do when it gets into the impure elements, since it is more
        than
        superior
        to fire? Verily, I am telling you that Tartarum, when it is
        prepared,
        has
        the power to make all unfixed things fixed, and in it are hidden
        all
        things
        which it would take too long to describe. Yet one cannot
        accomplish any
        perfect work in the Art without Tartarum; thus the hand cannot
        be
        prepared
        without Tartarum; for if there were no Tartarum, the Art would
        be
        false.
        Consequently, Tartarum is the master of Alchymia. That is why
        the
        masters
        consider it their fixed fire which burns everything that is not
        fixed. </p>
      <p>Take good white tartar of good Rhine wine. Wash the powder
        clean
        till
        the water runs off it. This has to be done with pure spring
        water. Then
        dry it in the sun, pound it small on a stone with good distilled
        wine
        vinegar,
        and dry it in the sun. Then moisten it on a stone with fresh
        vinegar to
        a thick pap. Now dry it again. Repeat this at least 10 times or
        more.
        Put
        this Tartarum thus imbibed into a strong suitable vessel and
        close it
        firmly,
        a good hand’s breadth. </p>
      <p>Now take another, still larger vessel, fill it with living
        chalk.
        Into
        it put the vessel with the tartar; after this, fill the large
        vessel
        completely
        with living chalk; also around the tartar, so that it lies in
        the
        center
        like an egg yolk in an egg. Lute tightly as much as you can, a
        large
        hand’s
        breadth’s, and let everything gently dry of itself. </p>
      <p>Make a big hole in your hearth in which you have a fire
        everyday;
        fill
        it with living chalk, put the vessel in it, and fill it all
        around with
        living chalk; but leave the bilge of the vessel free. On this
        your fire
        must burn for 8 weeks; keep it hot day and night, afterwards in
        a glow.
        The more it is calcined, the better. After this, remove the
        small
        vessel
        from the chalk, break it open, and pour the Tartarum into a
        large
        quantity
        of distilled vinegar, let it drop or become pure during three
        days.
        Pour
        the pure off from above and into another vessel. Pour other
        vinegar on
        the faeces, boil it and let it become clear as before; pour it
        to the
        other
        vinegar. Repeat this till nothing comes off any more. Throw the
        faeces
        away and Evaporate your vinegar; congeal all the salt till dry;
        again
        dissolve
        it in a large quantity of vinegar, as before. Let it boil once
        more;
        let
        it settle again, and pour the pure off above the fecibus; add
        other
        vinegar,
        and repeat this till no more faeces remain. </p>
      <p>Now put it into an open crucible, let it glow for 24 hours in a
        furnace;
        then dissolve it again, and let it stand thus dissolved for 3
        hours in
        order to see if there are any more faeces. Should it have
        faeces, they
        must again be clarified off, till no more faeces occur; then
        congeal it
        till it is dry. After this, imbibe Tartarum on a glass with Aqua
        Vitae,
        to a thin pap. Dry it in the sun or on hot ashes in a glass;
        imbibe and
        dry it again. Do this 100 times or more; the more the better,
        and the
        more
        it gets purged. Thereafter dry it in a glass which can stand the
        fire;
        lute it tightly below, put it uncovered on a furnace and let it
        melt.
        When
        it is molten, break the glass open. It will congeal in the air
        as clear
        as glass, and melt near the fire like butter. This is the fire
        of the
        wise
        philosophers. It is their fixed fire, of which they write in a
        veiled
        way
        which the simpletons do not understand. </p>
      <p>When it is now thus prepared, it is a precious treasure, for
        with
        it
        all volatile matters can be fixed. Yes, put Mercury into a
        crucible
        with
        a little of this Tartarum upon it, put it in the fire and let it
        go,
        and
        it will turn into fixed Mercury. In various small works one has
        to
        prepare
        it in this way; because whoever works with it when it is not
        prepared,
        will not reach any Perfection, although he may accomplish a
        semblance
        of
        silver and gold. Also, those who thus work in unprepared Sales
        cheat
        themselves
        and all those who believe them. </p>

        <p><b>Sol and Mercury</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Here begins a most glorious work of Sol and Mercury; how to
        conjoin
        and unite them; also how to fix them together into the very best
        solid
        gold. </p>
      <p>First you must make an Aquan Mercurialem. I will, however,
        advise
        all
        people against this Art, if they do not know how to deal with
        mercury,
        nor can prepare the water described hereafter. </p>
      <p>Let them keep their hands off Mercury, for they would fare
        badly.
        This
        water is of two kinds, one to the Red and the other to the
        White. Take
        4 Cologne quarts of good wine vinegar; potash, 1 lb, quicklime,
        weed
        ashes,
        tartar well calcined in a potter’s furnace and afterwards
        pulverized,
        each
        2 lbs. First pour the wine vinegar on the lime, let it stand on
        it, and
        stir it with a stick 7 or 8 times a day. After this, filter the
        vinegar
        and pour it on the weed-ashes in a glazed pot. Let it boil for a
        quarter
        of an hour, then cool down. Filter it again and pour it on the
        Tartarum;
        boil and filter as before. </p>
      <p>Now take 6 lbs of green, common celandine; chop it finely, put
        it
        into
        2 quarts of sharp wine vinegar, boil it down to half, then
        filter it
        and
        mix it with the other aforementioned water. Then take 1 lb Aqua
        Vitae;
        coarse salt that has not boiled away, 1 lb. Let them boil up
        together,
        but be careful not to put your matter in vessels coated with
        lead. Into
        this water thus boiled, put 8 or 10 ox galls, or galls of other
        animals.
        Mix them, and put this matter into a glass pot; put it for 6
        weeks in
        horse
        dung, and it is ready. The older it becomes, the better it is.
        With
        this
        water one accomplishes wonders. It is called Sucus Mercurii, and
        it is
        a very good piece in this Art. </p>
      <p>Take, therefore, good Mercury from the mines, not made from
        lead,
        tin
        or other metals. Take as much as you wish, grind it well with
        salt and
        vinegar in a stone mortar. Do it 12 times, till no more impurity
        comes
        off it; make a Corpus of it, put it into a phial and add as much
        beautiful,
        white salt. Mix well, put it on the furnace in sand for 3 weeks
        with a
        gentle fire; then put it into a stone mortar, pour the
        aforementioned
        water
        on it, grind it with it till no more impurity comes off it; put
        it back
        again into ashes or sand, pour your prepared water 3 fingers’
        breadth
        above
        it, stopper the phial, and give it a good fire for 6 days and
        nights.
        Then
        put it back into the mortar and grind it again with the same
        water, as
        before; put it again into a phial, and again pour water on it,
        and give
        fire for 6 days and nights, somewhat stronger than before.
        Repeat this
        6 times, and you must increase your fire each time every 6 days.
      </p>
      <p>After this, calcine 4 or 5 lbs of Vitriol; also calcine an
        equal
        amount
        of ochre to each pound add&nbsp;<img src="z.jpg" height="20"
          width="11">&nbsp;
        x bloodstone haematite to calcine with the other. Through this
        sublimate
        mercury 5 times; then he is prepared. Now take Sol which has
        been cast
        through Venus&nbsp;<img src="z.jpg" height="20" width="11"> j;
        prepared
        Mercury&nbsp;<img src="z.jpg" height="20" width="11">
        viii, amalgamate it, put it into a well luted phial, put it on
        its side
        in sand, and at first give a gentle fire. Increase your fire
        daily,
        till
        Mercury no longer rises; and turn the phial over every day 4 or
        5
        times,
        the more the better. At the end, when Mercury is quite dead, you
        will
        find
        a brown powder. Now your work is accomplished. Now remove this
        powder
        from
        the phial for the praise and thanks to God Almighty. Put 1 part
        on 4 of
        fine silver, let them well incorporate together. This work is
        certain
        and
        without troubles. That is why you must use it in the name of
        god. </p>

      <center>
        <p><b>How to Make Sal Urinae</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Take several large, stone crocks, 10 or 12 quarts capacity,
        fill
        them
        with old, pure urine, 5 or 6 weeks old. Put an alembic with two
        spouts
        on, and to each spout, a large Recipient; distill on the fire
        whatever
        you can distill over. Then a great deal of blackness will stay
        in the
        jar.
        Take that out and calcine it for 2 or 3 hours. After this,
        remove it
        from
        the fire and dissolve it in common distilled water; let the
        faeces
        drop,
        and pour off the faecibus above. Put this pure water back on the
        fire
        and
        boil it till there forms a skin above. Then put it into a cool
        cellar,
        and a clear salt will crystallize. Take that out and boil the
        water
        down
        again till a skin forms. </p>
      <p>Now take all the crystallized salt and dry it in an earthenware
        pan
        till it powders. Now heat it moderately without melting it in a
        low
        vessel,
        and dissolve it again in common distilled water. Let it boil for
        a
        quarter
        of an hour, remove it from the fire, let the faeces settle down,
        pour
        the
        pure off above when it is still warm. Then dry all the
        crystallized
        matter
        in an earthenware pan as before, till it dusts. Keep this till I
        teach
        you how to use it. </p>
      <p>Now take all the distilled urine and, if there is still some
        impurity
        in it of oil or yellow greasiness, skim it off above with a
        spoon and
        afterwards
        with a feather. Make it pure and clean in this way; then put it
        into
        the
        stone jar with a helm on it; set it in sand or ashes, and
        distill all
        that
        can be distilled. Let it nicely glow for a while and afterwards
        cool
        down.
        Remove the faeces and throw them away, for they are good for
        nothing.
        Repeat
        this distillation till everything goes over pure, without
        leaving any
        faeces
        at the bottom of the jar or retort. </p>
      <p>Take that which you have thus distilled out of the fire, put it
        in
        the
        Balneum to distill. Some impurity will stay at the bottom; throw
        it
        away.
        Grind this Distillation in the Balneum till no more faeces stay
        at the
        bottom of the jar. When everything has cleanly gone over, it is
        done. </p>
      <p>Now take the salt which I told you to keep above. Put it into a
        large
        Recipient, and pour on it the pure liquor which you have
        distilled in
        the
        Balneum. When you have poured the water on it, stopper the
        Recipient
        with
        a cork, and put it on the furnace in a vessel with ashes. Now
        light a
        fire
        in the furnace, so that the ashes will become hot. Keep the
        Recipient
        standing
        there for 4 or 5 days, or till all the salt has been dissolved
        into
        pure
        water without Faeces at the bottom. Then it is ready and done.
        Then it
        is urine as it was before, but now it is deprived of its
        coarseness and
        has become subtle, yes, much subtler than one could believe. I
        am
        telling
        you in unadulterated Charity of god that one can accomplish
        wonders in
        our Art with this urine this prepared, yes, more than one might
        believe. </p>
      <p>Add to it 6 quarts of sharp, distilled vinegar, and 6 Mass of
        Aqua
        Vitae,
        and 1 lb of prepared common salt; also, 1 lb of calcined white
        tartar,
        and 1-1/2 lb of *. Mix all these things together, and dissolve
        the
        matter
        into a pure, clear water, without any faeces at the bottom. I
        swear to
        you by God who has created and made me, that no greater secret
        has ever
        come into the world. For this water thus prepared, turns all
        Calxes and
        Corpora into their first nature, that is, into Mercury. With
        this water
        one can draw the QE from calcined Antimony, which is much better
        than
        all
        the treasures of the earth. In addition, you can extract with it
        the QE
        Solis and Lunae, and, furthermore, of all mineral things, and of
        everything
        there is in the world. One does so many wonderful things with
        this
        water
        that it is unbelievable; nor is it permissible to disclose it on
        account
        of the evil which might ensue. </p>
      <p>Understand, however, this booklet well at bottom, and you will
        know
        what wonderful things one can perform with this water. And even
        if I
        did
        my very best, I could not express one thousandth of its secret.
        Know
        also
        that one can use the water like earth, for it does not diminish
        although
        it were used 10 or 12 times. For you may purify and rectify it
        again,
        and
        it will be just as good. </p>
      <p>Now I will teach you how to extract the tinctures required for
        this
        work, Red as well as White; for the extraction of White and red
        is all
        one and is due to one mastery. Take, therefore, Sulphur,
        Auripigment,
        Atrament,
        Ochre, Cerussa, Minum, or the like, out of which you wish to
        extract
        the
        tincture. Powder it impalpably, and grind it like soap on a
        stonewith
        good,
        distilled vinegar, each time adding&nbsp;<img src="z.jpg"
          height="20" width="11">
        j of rectified salt. Put it into a big Recipient, set it into
        ashes or
        sand, pour on it some of the clarified urine which you have
        prepared, 1
        part, and 1 part of wine vinegar, so that the Recipient becomes
        half
        full.
        Stopper it above with a cork, and shake itwell, so that the
        moisture
        gets
        well mixed with the powder. Put the glass back into the furnace,
        and
        when
        it is warm, remove the cork or stopper and give it some air;
        otherwise
        the glass would burst. Toss the Receptacle between your hands 10
        or 12
        times a day, and let it stand in the warmth till the Liquor is
        nicely
        colored.
        Then let the glass cool down and the Faeces drop; take another
        large
        Recipient
        that is clean. In it pour the colored Liquor off from the
        Faecibus, and
        take good care not to take any Faeces over. Stopper the
        Recipient and
        put
        it aside. Then take again fresh urine with Ana distilled
        vinegar, pour
        it upon the Faeces in the receiver, as before, half full. Shake
        it with
        your hands as you did then; and when the Liquor is well mixed
        with the
        sediment, put the glass again on the furnace in ashes or sand.
        Heat as
        before, and when the Liquor has again been colored, let the
        glass again
        cool down, pouring off and proceeding as before. Repeat this
        till the
        Liquor
        is no longer colored by the Faeces, and then you have got all
        the
        Tincture
        or QE. The Faeces can be thrown away, but they still contain the
        element
        of earth. You may extract and use that as you wish. </p>
      <p>Now take the glass containing the colored moisture, set it in
        ashes
        or sand, and distill the moisture off till a skin appears on
        top. Now
        remove
        the helm, pour it into a large glass pot which must be wide
        above. Lute
        a helm on top of it, put this pot on the same furnace, and draw
        all
        humidity
        over. Thus the QE or Tincture of the thing you took to make it
        will
        stay
        in Fundo, be it Red or White. If it is a white Subjectum, you
        will find
        a white tincture, whiter than snow; but if it is red, it will
        shine
        like
        gold, just as the sun shines above Venus. And in this way you
        can
        extract,
        sublimate, the tincture of Mercury Sublimatus to the Red or
        White. In
        the
        same manner you can extract the tincture of QE from iron or
        copper
        filings,
        verdigris or burnt copper, cinnabar, Cerussa or Minium, or from
        calcined
        tin, also from Calx Solis or Lunae, item from Antimony. In
        addition,
        you
        can add the tincture, which you have thus extracted from
        sublimation to
        the Red or the White, to gold or silver, when they are
        dissolved, and
        put
        them in Putrefactionem. Thus they can be joined to the said
        Medicine,
        and
        the color will become all the more beautiful during Projection.
      </p>
      <p>Know, however, that whenever you wish to extract something you
        must
        each time add&nbsp;<img src="z.jpg" height="20" width="11"> j to
        the
        urine
        and distilled vinegar, which must be rectified of its
        Terrestriality by
        dissolving and again congealing before you pour it on the ground
        Materia
        in the Recipients. Know, in addition, that there is a great deal
        of
        secrecy
        in the extraction of this tincture, more than one could believe.
        For
        with
        these tinctures you can make Cements, in whatever Cement you
        with to
        Cement,
        or accomplish other wonderful things by Cementing. Item, you can
        make
        Aquas
        Fortes with these tinctures, which are red as blood and shine
        like a
        ruby.
        With these AFs you can do wonderful things during Solution, to
        disclose
        which I have not got permission. </p>

        <p><b>Now Follow Some Annotations Concerning Various Termini
            Used in
            the
            Preparations</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Liquefactio</i> means making soft, and it is the root of all
        things. </p>
      <p><i>Exaltio</i> of the spirit is <i>Liquefactio</i> of the
        bodies. </p>
      <p>The <i>Salts</i> of the bodies are made in many different
        ways. </p>
      <p><i>Solutio</i> means melting, or also stamping. </p>
      <p><i>Calcinatio</i> means making chalk or calx. It is done in
        sand,
        with
        strong fire, so as to draw the foul Sulphur from a thing; then,
        when
        such
        is consumed, the Corpus remains pure in the calx. Therupon comes
        <i>Inceratio</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Inceratio</i> means making the chalks subtle or fine, so
        that
        the
        humidity may pass all the better through the Corpora. Inceratio
        is
        nothing
        but grinding and imbibing till the material turns into wax, and
        such
        may
        easily be dissolved or melted with a small or gentle fire. </p>
      <p><i>Dissolutio</i> means delivery, release. It is done in the
        bodies
        that are calcined, and in the following manner: Put the matter
        that you
        wish to dissolve into a glass, and stopper it well. Cover it
        with moist
        earth, and put on it horse dung well sprinkled with water. Let
        it stand
        thus for 7 days. On the 8th day it will be dissolved, and this
        is
        Dissolutio
        by heat. But Dissolutio of cold humidity consists in making an
        edge and
        standing a glazed vessel on it. Complete this with a little
        water on
        the
        bottom. Let the glass hang above the water, but in such a way
        that it
        does
        not touch the water. Cover the glass vessel with a lid, but put
        wax on
        the glass, and sand on the wax. Let it stand thus for one day
        and one
        night,
        and it will dissolve. </p>
      <p><i>Coagulatio</i> means making hard, and it is done in this
        way:
        Take
        the aforementioned glass with the matter that is dissolved, and
        put it
        into a test with strained ashes, and light a fire under the test
        for 10
        hours, or till the humidity has gone out. Then it will look like
        minium;
        but it is white, like a very white camphor. </p>
      <p><i>Rubifactio Salts Ammonici</i>: Take *, Crocus Mars Ana, well
        pulverized
        together. Put this into a glass and pour on it good distilled
        wine
        vinegar,
        three fingers breadth above it. Let it stand thus one day and
        one
        night,
        always stirring well. Then alow it to dry gently over a mild
        fire.
        After
        this, put the Crocus Mars and the * into a Sublimatorium, and
        sublimate
        them. It will descend, red like blood, even if the vinegar is
        not
        distilled.
        This actually is of no consequence, it is just as good. </p>
      <p><i>Rubifactio Vitrioli Romani</i>: Graduate it, and calcine it
        in
        a
        strong fire; it will become red like blood. </p>
