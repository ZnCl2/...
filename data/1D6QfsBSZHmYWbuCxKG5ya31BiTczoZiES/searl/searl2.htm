      <p>This report is based on a series of interviews given by John
        R.R. Searl on a number of occasions since 1982 and contains
        information and data concerning the experimental work on
        permanent magnets carried out by him between 1946 and 1952. The
        experiments resulted in the claimed discovery of a new source of
        energy, the so-called Searl-Effect (SE) and the invention of a
        new permanent magnet machine, the so-called Searl-Effect
        Generator (SEG) to utilize this effect. The report also contains
        data and information regarding important tests and measurements
        made on the SEG, or part thereof, by Searl in cooperation with
        other research workers after the aforementioned time period. </p>
      <p>It must be stressed that all documentation describing the
        experimental procedures and the equipment used was destroyed by
        fire in 1983. It is therefore not possible to give a detailed
        and accurate account of Searl's work. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the information gathered is believed to contain
        enough data to allow a successful repetition of the experiments
        to be made. </p>
      <p>The reconstruction of the equipment used has been a joint
        effort between Searl and the author, in particular the
        magnetizing coil and the switching equipment. </p>

      <p><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction</b> </p>
      <p>In 1946, at the age of fourteen, John Roy Robert Searl began
        his employment as a trainee at the Midland Electricity Board
        (MEB) in Birmingham to become an electrical and electronics
        fitter. The MEB produced their own permanent magnets to be used
        in the manufacturing of energy-meters and other electrical
        instruments. This work was carried out in the electronics
        workshop where Searl was a trainee. Soon, Searl became involved
        in the production of permanent magnets and gradually learned the
        manufacturing procedures and how to use tools and the necessary
        equipment. Also, the management gave him permission to use the
        research laboratory for his experiments which were considered to
        be part of his training. It was in this environment Searl began
        his experimental work on permanent magnets that eventually
        culminated with the discovery of a new magnetic effect. </p>
      <p>Searl's original idea was that free electrons in spinning metal
        bodies may have a tendency to move in the radial direction due
        to inertial forces. If this hypothesis was correct then an
        electric potential difference should develop between the center
        and periphery of a rotating shaft and between the inner edge and
        the rim of a slip ring. He also held the view that the
        electromotive force induced in spinning bodies due to the
        earth's magnetic field could be used for generating electric
        energy. Accordingly, Searl's first series of experiments
        consisted of careful measurements on fast rotating steel shafts
        and slip rings made of brass and indeed he was able to show the
        existence of a minute electric voltage in the radial direction.
        If this voltage was due to the inertial properties of the
        electrons or induced by the magnetic field of the earth was
        never established. However, it soon became evident that this
        simple generator would only be practically useful if means could
        be found to increase the power output. </p>
      <p>At this stage in the experimental work any person with a formal
        education in electrical engineering would have considered the
        principle unworkable and the effect an academic curiosity
        without practical applications. However, Searl was not so easily
        discouraged and began experiments with rotating permanent
        magnets manufactured by him using a magnetic material(l) made by
        Mullard UK and later using magnetic alloys imported from the
        USA. These alloys proved to be superior compared with the
        magnetic material manufactured by Mullard (Whether or not this
        material was a ferromagnetic alloy or a ferrite s not known).
        The use of permanent magnet material resulted in a considerable
        improvement and by now Searl was convinced that this simple
        principle could be used to generate electricity. Whether Searl's
        choice of magnetic materials was a deliberate experimental
        strategy or a coincidence is not known, but in due course the
        use of these materials did lead to unexpected effects. </p>
      <p><a name="mfrproc"></a><b>The Manufacturing Procedure of the
          Permanent Magnets Used by Searl</b> </p>
      <p>During the early part of his training period Searl manufactured
        a great number of permanent magnets in the shapes of cylindrical
        bars, hollow cylinders, annular rings and rectangular rods. The
        magnets were moulded by pressing a mixture of magnetic powder
        and a bonding agent. For this operation a hydraulic press with
        appropriate press tools was used. The work was carried out
        inside a vacuum chamber to prevent explosion. Moulds made of
        bakelite were also used and the mixture of magnetic powder and
        binder was packed by hand into the bakelite mould and the whole
        assembly placed into the vacuum chamber with the intention of
        removing the air from the mixture and increasing the mass
        density of the magnets. However, this method was less efficient
        than using the hydraulic press which produced better and denser
        magnets. The curing of the moulded cores could sometimes take as
        long as three days. This suggests that curing took place at room
        temperature and a liquid binder was used. In later experiments
        Searl successfully used nylon (thermoplastic) with an excess of
        negative charges. These charges appear to have taken an active
        part in the production of the Searl effect. </p>
      <p>Two types of magnetic alloys and bonding agents were imported
        from the USA by Searl. This material was paid for by George
        Haynes of Turner Street, West Bromwich, who financially
        supported Searl's experimental work between 1946 and 1948; the
        reason being that Mr. Haynes' son and Searl made the experiments
        together. </p>
      <p>A magnet produced in 1946 by a mixture of the two alloys was
        analyzed qualitatively in 1984 and found to contain the
        following elements: Aluminium, Silicon, Sulphur, Titanium,
        Neodymium, Iron. </p>
      <p>The precautions taken by Searl when handling the highly
        flammable element neodymium and details concerning the moulding
        process have never been properly investigated. Likewise, the
        identities of the American suppliers of the magnetic alloys have
        not yet been established. </p>
      <p>Further information regarding the magnet specimen is found in
        Appendix A. </p>
      <p><a name="magneqpt"></a><b>The Magnetising Equipment Used by
          Searl</b> </p>
      <p>The coil used by Searl to magnetise the moulded cores was
        originally intended for and used to demagnetise (degaussing)
        turbine shafts and generator shafts and consisted of
        approximately 200 turns of heavy electric copper wire normally
        used for connecting electric cookers to the mains. The
        magnetising current used was 180 amperes and supplied by a
        Westinghouse three-phase mercury rectifier. The on-off switching
        operation was carried out manually using a high current switch
        and the on-off duty cycle lasted for seconds rather than
        fractions of a second. More information regarding the coil can
        be found in the report SEG-002. </p>
      <p><a name="magnmethod"></a><b>A Novel Magnetising Method</b> </p>
      <p>Based on what can only be described as intuition, Searl
        suggested that a second winding should be added to the existing
        magnetizing DC-coil and connected to an AC-source. This
        proposition created heated discussions amongst his fellow
        workers as to the effect of such a magnetising method. The
        general view was that the magnetic field created by an
        alternating current would partly cancel the magnetic field
        created by the direct current and make the coil less efficient.
        However, Searl suggested that the existing RF-signal generator
        in the laboratory should be used as an AC-source; this would
        prevent cancellation of the DC-field. This idea was met with an
        even greater scepticism as the current supplied by the signal
        generator would be minute and have insignificant effect on the
        magnetising process. Searl persisted, however, with his views
        and eventually succeeded in winning his manager's approval for
        the idea. Searl can remember his manager carrying out certain
        calculations concerning the design of the AC-winding. These
        calculations were at the time beyond Searl's comprehension and
        no information is any longer available regarding their nature.
        The exact number of turns in the AC-winding remains unknown
        despite a considerable effort on Searl's part to recall the
        details concerning the coil. However, based on fundamental
        electrical engineering it can be assumed that the calculations
        involved resonance (to maximize the number of ampere-turns in
        the AC winding, parallel resonance should be used) and
        characteristic impedance determinations with the intention of
        avoiding shorting out the signal generator. It is, therefore,
        reasonable to suggest that these calculations can be repeated
        and a reconstruction of the AC-winding can be made. </p>
      <p>The switching equipment consisted of two hand-operated switches
        which had been mechanically interlocked; one switch for the
        DC-current and the other switch for the AC-current. </p>
      <p><a name="gengeom"></a><b>Generator Geometry</b> </p>
      <p>Exactly when Searl decided to use the 'roller bearing' geometry
        as a model for his generators is not known and will require
        further investigation. However, it must have been very early in
        his career, probably as early as 1946. The inertial and the
        gyroscopic effects of a fast spinning ball-race intrigued him
        and Searl used to release fast rotating ball-races and study
        their behaviour when they dissipated the kinetic energy through
        collisions with surrounding objects. It was most certainly the
        result of these experiments that inspired him to use this
        configuration for his generators. </p>
      <p><a name="discov"></a><b>The Discovery of the Searl-Effect and
          the Invention of the Searl-Effect Generator</b> </p>
      <p>Equipped with these new ideas concerning geometry and
        magnetizing methods, Searl started to make generators consisting
        of a single annular ring surrounded bya number of rollers. By
        keeping the ring stationary and forcing the rollers to spin
        about their own axis and simultaneously revolve around the ring
        by driving them with an electric motor, the generators produced
        voltages in excess of 30 kilovolts. However, it was not always
        that Searl was successful in producing such high voltages. Since
        he did not know the mechanism responsible for the effect, it was
        very much a matter of trial and error to reproduce the magnets.
        Sometimes the failure rate was very high, seventy percent or
        more; out of a batch of a hundred (100) magnets only thirty (30)
        would work. The reason for this was never established with
        certainty, but it is believed to have been caused by the
        primitive switching equipment used. </p>
      <p><a name="searleff"></a><b>The Searl-Effect</b> </p>
      <p>At a certain critical speed some of the generators would
        suddenly lock in to a mode of operation that appeared to be some
        kind of positive feedback and they would run spontaneously
        without any mechanical connection to the driving motor. In the
        beginning Searl could not control this effect at all. </p>
      <p>Later, he found that by loading the generators electrically it
        was possible to reduce the speed, but once this state of
        operation had been reached the generators could not be stopped.
        However, it is possible that if appropriate test equipment had
        been available Searl would have been able to bring the
        generators to a halt by loading them either electrically or
        mechanically. It must be pointed out that Searl did not have the
        financial support required to carry out such comprehensive and
        dangerous tests and even if he had access to the workshops and
        the laboratory at the MEB, where such tests could have been
        made, he was certainly not allowed to carry out dangerous
        experiments on the MEB's premises. </p>
      <p>As the experimental work progressed Searl succeeded in reducing
        the critical speed to a value close to zero by a careful design
        and by increasing the number of rollers, and eventually he was
        able to produce a generator that was self starting. Searl
        discovered that when the generators were running the air
        pressure decreased in the immediate vicinity of and inside the
        generators. At voltages above thirty kilovolts the air motion
        was directed away from the rim of the generators, and candle
        light that had been placed at the centre of the generator ring
        went out due to lack of oxygen. This decrease of the air
        pressure could explain the absence of flashover between the ring
        and the rollers. Searl also discovered that the temperature
        dropped considerably close to and in the interior of the
        generators, probably due to the transport of air away from the
        generator. Another interesting effect was that objects placed
        inside the generator ring lost their weight. The existence of
        these effects were later confirmed by use of proper measuring
        equipment. </p>
      <p><a name="seq"></a><b>The Searl-Effect Generator</b> </p>
      <p>Three different systems were developed to extract the energy
        produced by the SEG; one mechanical system and two electrical: </p>
      <p>(1) The mechanical system: The details concerning the
        mechanical drive system are not known and are yet to be
        investigated. </p>
      <p>(2) The high voltage system: This system was originally
        developed for measuring the electric potential difference
        generated between the stationary ring and the moving rollers.
        The positive generator terminal was fitted to the ring and the
        negative terminal consisted of a number of parallel-connected
        comb-shaped electrodes mounted around the generator periphery
        and in close proximity to the rollers, as shown in Figure 1. </p>
      <p>(3) The low voltage system: By fitting a number of stationary
        c-shaped induction coils around the rim of the generator, as
        shown in Figure 2, and connecting them in series or parallel, or
        a combination of both, the SEG produced electric power of its
        own ( ~ 10<sup>2</sup> watts). </p>
      <p>Several small generators of this type were manufactured and by
        1952 Searl had built the first multi-ring generator. </p>

      <p><a name="3ring"></a><b>The 3-Ring Generator &amp; the
          Searl-Levity Disc</b> </p>
      <p>This device was about three feet in diameter and consisted of
        three segmented rings in the same plane, with a number of
        induction coils at its periphery (Details regarding this device
        can be found in the report SEG-001, October 1982). Each ring
        consisted of a number of magnetic segments with insulating
        spacers between each such magnet. Due to high cost, this
        generator did not contain enough roller-magnets to be
        self-starting. </p>
      <p>The generator was tested by Searl and a friend of his in the
        open and the armature was set in motion by a small engine. The
        device produced an unexpectedly high electrostatic potential in
        the radial direction. At relatively low armature speeds a very
        high voltage was produced and indicated by static effects on
        nearby objects. Characteristic crackling and the smell of ozone
        supported the conclusion. </p>
      <p>The unexpected then occurred. The generator lifted while still
        speeding up, broke the union between itself and the engine, and
        rose to an altitude of about 50 feet. Here it stayed for a
        while, still speeding up and surrounded itself in a pink halo.
        This indicated ionization of the air at a much-reduced pressure.
      </p>
      <p>Another interesting side effect caused local radio receivers to
        go on of their own accord. This could have been due to ionizing
        discharge or electromagnetic induction. Finally, the whole
        generator accelerated at a fantastic rate and is believed to
        have gone off into space. </p>
      <p>Since 1952, Searl and his co-workers have manufactured and
        tested more than 10 generators, the largest being a 10-meter
        disc-shaped craft, the so-called Searl-Levity Disc (SLD). Figure
        3 shows a smaller version of the SLD. </p>

        Cheese (a material science technician at the School of
        Engineering &amp; Applied Sciences, Univ. of Sussex)) on April
        16, 1984, using Energy Dispersive X-Ray Analysis, the so-called
        EDAX-spectrum, and found to contain the following constituent

      <p>According to information received from Dr. Anthony Simpson(a
        retired materials scientist and a former lecturer in the School
        of engineering &amp; Applied Sciences, Univ. of Susses) the
        element neodymium was most certainly included to reduce the
        oxygen content and prevent it from having an adverse effect on
        the magnetic properties of the alloy. There is the possibility
        that the neodymium was a contamination but that is less likely.
        In either case the percentage neodymium was probably less than
        10% by weight (5% by weight is most likely). </p>
      <p>The dimensions and the magnetic polarity of the magnet specimen
        on which the tests were carried out are shown in Figure A2. </p>

      <p>Figure A3 shows the magnetic flux pattern obtained by use of
        iron filings. The magnet was identical to one of the bar magnets
        demonstrated by Searl on August 15, 1982, as shown in the report
        SEG-001. At the time of testing (April 1984) the magnet had been
        accidentically broken during transport. </p>

      <p>The magnetic flux density, measured approximately two mm from
        the pole faces (Figure A2), was 0.05 Tesla or 500 gauss using a
        standard magnetic flux density meter with Hall-Effect probe
        (Magnetometer D11, Scientifica &amp; Cook Ltd, London) </p>
      <p>The existence of the "recorded" pole pattern could not be
        confirmed using the aforementioned flux density meter. Such
        tests would have required a more sensitive instrument. </p>
      <p>Other physical parameters: </p>
      <p>Total weight: 67.6 gr <br>
        Total volume: 14.1 cm3 <br>
        Mass density: 4.79 g/cm </p>
      <p>Figures A4 and A5 show two electron micrographs revealing the
        surface structure of the sample used for analysis at
        magnifications of X1000 and X4400 respectively. [Not available]
      </p>
      <p>At the time of testing (April 1984), lack of funds and other
        duties prevented additional important measurements from being
        made. The magnet was therefore returned to Searl with the
        intention of borrowing it at a future date for further
        investigation. However, upon later request the author was
        informed by Searl that all magnets in his possession had been
        lost.</p>
