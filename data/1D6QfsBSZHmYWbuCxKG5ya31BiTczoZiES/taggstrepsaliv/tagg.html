      <br>
      In the near future, the cause of our stinky morning breath could
      be the thing that helps us beat it. Our body is filled with
      trillions microorganisms. Some of those microbes hang out in our
      mouth, which is nice and humid. While we sleep, our mouths
      sometimes dry out, which can kill off some good bacteria and cause
      gas-emitting bacteria to thrive. That's the reason you sometimes
      wake up with a putrid-smelling mouth.<br>
      <br>
      But, there's a solution, and its name is Streptococcus salivarius
      K12. Researchers think the bacteria strain could soon be put into
      a lozenge or spray and used as a probiotic, or beneficial mix of
      bacteria, to knock out the bad bacteria that causes bad breath. <br>
      <br>
      The delicate balance of microbes living inside each one of us,
      collectively called our microbiome, helps keep our body running.
      Unfortunately, things we do - like taking antibiotics, for example
      - can wipe out many of these beneficial microbes, throwing off the
      balance.<br>
      <br>
      Susan Perkins, one of the curators of a recent exhibit at the
      American Museum of Natural History focused on the microbiome, told
      Business Insider she wouldn't be surprised if we started using
      bacteria to treat morning breath within the year.<br>
      <br>
      A 2006 study of 23 people with halitosis, or bad breath, found
      that those given S. salivarius K12 lozenges had lower levels of
      smelly breath. The participants started by using an antimicrobial
      mouthwash followed by either a placebo lozenge or one with S.
      salivarius K12. They found that the addition of the bacteria
      reduced the levels of smelly breath better than the mouthwash on
      its own. <br>
      <br>
      Ideally, this probiotic could be used in addition to mouthwashes
      like Listerine, which kill all the bacteria - good and bad - in
      your mouth. Andrea Azcarate-Peril, the director of the University
      of North Carolina's Microbiome Research Core, told Business
      Insider that antibacterial solutions like mouthwash and hand
      sanitiser are being overused to the point where they could be
      doing more harm than good.<br>
      <br>
      "We are just too clean," she said.<br>
      <br>
      But probiotics aren't a perfect solution either. At least not yet.
      We still don't know everything about the bacteria in our bodies,
      and not every probiotic works for every person. Plus, probiotics
      still aren't regulated by the FDA, so it's a little tricky to know
      if the supplements people are taking are actually doing what they
      say they are. <br>
      <br>
      Even so, the probiotics industry is expanding. The hope is to
      eventually use these probiotics to treat everything from cancer to
      bad body odour, said Perkins.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, keep your eye out for S. salivarius K12. <br>

      <br>
      <b>MATERIALS AND RESULTS:</b><br>
      <br>
      Twenty-three subjects with halitosis undertook a 3-day regimen of

      use of lozenges containing either S. salivarius K12 or placebo.
      Assessment of the subjects' volatile sulphur compound (VSC) levels
      1 week after treatment initiation showed that 85% of the
      K12-treated group and 30% of the placebo group had substantial
      (&gt;100 ppb) reductions. The bacterial composition of the saliva
      was monitored by culture and PCR-denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Changes in the PCR-DGGE profiles
      occurred in most subjects following K12 treatment. In vitro
      testing showed that S. salivarius K12 suppressed the growth of

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The primary treatment for oral malodour is the reduction of
      bacterial populations, especially those present on the tongue, by
      use of a variety of antimicrobial agents or mechanical devices.
      However, shortly after treatment the problematic bacteria quickly
      repopulate the tongue and the malodour returns. In our studies, we
      have used a broadly-active antimicrobial (chlorhexidine) to effect
      temporary depletion of the oral microbiota and then have attempted
      to repopulate the tongue surface with Streptococcus salivarius
      K12, a benign commensal probiotic. The objective of this is to
      prevent re-establishment of non-desirable bacterial populations
      and thus help limit the re-occurrence of oral malodour over a
      prolonged period. In this paper, we discuss why contemporary
      probiotics are inadequate for treatment of oral malodour and
      examine the rationale for selection of particular bacterial
      species for future use in the treatment of this condition. In our
      preliminary trials of the use of a chlorhexidine rinse followed by
      strain K12 lozenges, the majority (8/13) of subjects with
      confirmed halitosis maintained reduced breath levels of volatile
      sulphur compounds for at least 2 weeks. We conclude that probiotic
      bacterial strains originally sourced from the indigenous oral
      microbiotas of healthy humans may have potential application as
      adjuncts for the prevention and treatment of halitosis.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>OBJECTIVE:</b><br>
      <br>
      To investigate the antimicrobial activity of the
      bacteriocin-producing strain Streptococcus salivarius K12 against
      several bacteria involved in halitosis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESIGN:</b><br>
      <br>
      The inhibitory activity of S. salivarius K12 against Solobacterium
      moorei CCUG39336, four clinical S. moorei isolates, Atopobium
      parvulum ATCC33793 and Eubacterium sulci ATCC35585 was examined by
      a deferred antagonism test. Eubacterium saburreum ATCC33271 and
      Parvimonas micra ATCC33270, which have been tested in previous
      studies, served as positive controls, and the Gram-negative strain
      Bacteroides fragilis ZIB2800 served as a negative control.
      Additionally, the occurrence of resistance in S. moorei CCUG39336
      to S. salivarius K12 was analysed by either direct plating or by
      passage of S. moorei CCUG39336 on chloroform-inactived S.
      salivarius K12-containing agar plates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><br>
      <br>
      S. salivarius K12 suppressed the growth of all Gram-positive
      bacteria tested, but the extent to which the bacteria were
      inhibited varied. E. sulci ATCC35585 was the most sensitive
      strain, while all five S. moorei isolates were inhibited to a
      lesser extent. Natural resistance seems to be very low in S.
      moorei CCUG39336, and there was only a slight decrease in
      sensitivity after exposure to S. salivarius K12 over 10 passages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSION:</b><br>
      <br>
      Our studies demonstrate that S. salivarius K12 has antimicrobial
      activity against bacteria involved in halitosis. This strain might
      be an interesting and valuable candidate for the development of an
      antimicrobial therapy for halitosis.<br>

      </b><b>Development of S. salivarius Probiotics: General Principles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Food and Agricultural Organization and WHO have published a
      list of recommended guidelines for the systematic assessment and
      development of strains that are under consideration as
      probiotics.[2] While this document focuses particularly on
      intestinal probiotics, its recommendations can be considered
      generally applicable to all probiotics. Some of the key steps
      taken in the commercial development of a probiotic are shown in
      Figure 1. It is important to note that, in practice, the process
      does not always follow an orderly pathway (especially in the
      developmental stage), and that some steps may prove especially
      problematic and need to be repeated prior to obtaining a
      successful and efficacious end-product.<br>

      </b><br>
      Although S. salivarius K12 was initially selected on the basis of
      its broad inhibitory activity against S. pyogenes, it has
      subsequently been demonstrated to provide more diverse health
      benefits – ranging from the alleviation of halitosis to
      stimulation of antiviral immune defenses and the reduction of
      episodes of OM. This broad spectrum of potential health benefits
      conferred throughout the life of the human host has prompted the
      adoption of the colloquial moniker for this strain, "BLIS K12 –
      the probiotic for all ages" (Figure 2).<br>

      In 2001, strain K12 became the first S. salivarius to be
      commercially developed as a probiotic and more than 50 million
      doses have now been marketed internationally by the New Zealand
      company BLIS Technologies Ltd (Dunedin, New Zealand). A
      substantial body of research was undertaken to underpin the safe
      and efficacious application of the strain to humans and this
      included a variety of clinical interventions in both animals and
      humans. Although S. salivarius is not commonly consumed as a
      naturally occurring food ingredient, it is nevertheless considered
      a low-risk organism since, in spite of its apparently invariable
      and plentiful presence in the human oral cavity, it is only very
      rarely a cause of infection in humans who are immunologically
      competent.[27] The safety of strain K12 has been specifically
      supported by a series of studies: affirming the absence of known
      streptococcal virulence factors and antibiotic resistance
      determinants; showing its low mutagenicity predisposition; acute
      and subacute toxicity testing in rats; and a high-dosage trial in
      humans.[29,35,36] The outcome of these strain-specific studies,
      together with recognition of the inherent safety of the species,
      has enabled a self-affirmed 'generally regarded as safe' (or
      'GRAS') status to be granted for strain K12 in the USA.
      Interestingly, the species S. salivarius is still generally
      classified as a risk group 2 organism in Europe; however, on the
      basis of its safety profile strain, K12 has been specifically
      reclassified as a risk group 1 organism in Germany by the Ausschuß
      für Biologische Arbeitsstoffe (Translation: Committee on
      Biological Agents).[43]<br>
      <br>
      The original source of S. salivarius K12 was a healthy schoolchild
      who had maintained a large indigenous oral cavity population of
      the K12 strain for a period of more than 12 months, during which
      time no new S. pyogenes infections were experienced. A distinctive
      (and indeed patentable) feature of strain K12 was its production
      of two novel lantibiotics (salivaricin A2 and B), both of which
      were shown in vitro to have inhibitory activity against S.
      pyogenes, the principal causative agent of streptococcal
      pharyngitis.[44] Further support, albeit indirect, for the
      protection offered by S. salivarius BLIS against S. pyogenes
      infection came from studies showing that children who harbored
      oral populations of salivaricin A- and/or B-producing S.
      salivarius had significantly fewer new acquisitions of S. pyogenes
      than did children who appeared not to have BLIS-producing S.
      salivarius (17 vs 32%, respectively).[45] Another study showed
      that children who frequently experienced clinically confirmed sore
      throats were significantly less likely to have BLIS-producing S.
      salivarius than children who had not experienced sore throats in
      the past 3 years.[46] Furthermore, competition experiments between
      cocultured strain K12 and a bioluminescent S. pyogenes
      demonstrated that strain K12 binds avidly to human epithelial cell
      lines and can interfere with the binding of S. pyogenes[28,47]
      (Figure 3). Oral cavity colonization of humans occurs following
      its introduction into the mouth and the efficacy of this
      colonization is enhanced by prior reduction of the levels of the
      indigenous streptococcal population, as occurs following the use
      of an antiseptic mouth rinse (e.g., chlorhexidine) or after
      antibiotic treatment.[15,48,49] Recent, as yet unpublished,
      studies have also demonstrated that the use of one lozenge a day
      containing 1 billion viable cfu of strain K12, is sufficient to
      achieve oral cavity colonization in the majority of subjects
      [WESCOMBE PA ET AL., UNPUBLISHED DATA]. Further evidence for the
      protection afforded by strain K12 against streptococcal
      pharyngitis was gathered during a small preliminary trial in which
      24 children with a history of recurrent tonsillitis (0.33 episodes
      per month) received daily doses of either strain K12 or a placebo.
      The 18 children receiving strain K12 experienced fewer sore
      throats (0.10 per month) than did the six children in the placebo
      group (0.19 per month) [BURTON JP ET AL., UNPUBLISHED DATA].<br>
      <br>
      S. salivarius, Rothia mucilaginosa and an uncharacterized species
      of Eubacterium were identified as being present in either
      relatively reduced numbers or absent in tongue dorsum populations
      of subjects suffering from halitosis.[50] Prompted by this
      observation, a trial of 23 subjects with halitosis (having breath
      scores for volatile sulfur compound [VSC] levels of greater than
      200 ppb) undertook a 3-day regimen of chlorhexidine mouth rinsing,
      followed, at intervals, by the use of lozenges containing either
      S. salivarius K12 or placebo.[49] Assessment of the subjects' VSC
      levels 1 week after treatment initiation demonstrated that 85% of
      the K12-treated group and 30% of the placebo group had substantial
      (&gt;100 ppb) VSC level reductions. While the majority of the
      subjects tested had a favorable outcome, the mechanism(s) of VSC
      reduction was not clearly established. In vitro tests showed that
      the inhibitory spectrum of strain K12 encompasses some of the key
      Gram-negative anaerobes (including Prevotella spp.) that have been
      implicated in halitosis.[49] Other mechanisms of competition
      (e.g., saturation of attachment sites by the newly introduced K12
      cells) may also have been influential, particularly as facilitated
      by the chlorhexidine pretreatment step, which may have reduced
      populations of some critical adjunct members of the
      halitosis-associated consortia. Subsequent colonization of the
      microbe-depleted site by the incoming K12 could also limit
      anaerobe proliferation through specific BLIS-mediated inhibition
      of key members of the halitosis-associated microbiota.<br>
      <br>
      OM is the most common bacterial infection in young children and
      the predominant etiological agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae,
      S. pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis and Haemophilus influenzae. As
      a preliminary experiment to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic
      interventions for the control of OM, it was shown that S.
      salivarius K12, when given to 19 young OM-susceptible children
      following a 3-day course of amoxicillin, led to colonization of
      the nasopharynx and/or the adenoid tissue of some subjects.[51]
      Interestingly, in that study, only 33% of the subjects achieved
      oral colonization with strain K12. This lower-than-anticipated
      level of colonization was attributed to the failure of the
      amoxicillin pretreatment to effect a substantial reduction in the
      level of the indigenous oral streptococcal populations, since most
      of these subjects had been preconditioned to regular amoxicillin
      exposure during the course of their OM therapy.[51] To determine
      whether delivery of the S. salivarius K12 probiotic to the oral
      cavity would have any effect on the rate of recurrence of OM, a
      small study was undertaken at Dunedin Hospital BURTON JP ET AL.,
      UNPUBLISHED DATA. The 13 children enrolled in the study were from
      the surgical waiting list for grommet implants and all had a
      history of recurrent acute OM (AOM). The subjects were offered a
      three-month treatment course of either strain K12 or placebo and
      nine completed the study. The children receiving the K12 probiotic
      (n = 6) had far fewer ear infections (0.22 per month) than they
      did prior to entering the study (0.50 per month, n = 13) and also
      by comparison with the smaller placebo group (0.55 occurences per
      month, n = 3) BURTON JP ET AL., UNPUBLISHED DATA. The encouraging
      results of this study (although only preliminary) indicate that S.
      salivarius K12 dosing could potentially reduce the occurrence of
      OM.<br>
      <br>
      An unanticipated application of S. salivarius K12 could be to
      ameliorate the development of oral candidosis. A number of early
      studies indirectly demonstrated that S. salivarius may inhibit
      oral candida,[52–55] but more recently Ishijima et al.[20] found a
      direct protective effect against Candida albicans after oral
      dosing with strain K12. In this latest study, K12 was shown to
      bind preferentially to the hyphae of C. albicans and to prevent
      its attachment to a plastic substratum. Interestingly, K12 was not
      able to directly inhibit C. albicans in a deferred antagonism
      assay, indicating that the bacteriocins encoded for by strain K12
      do not target yeast and further supporting other observations that
      mechanisms other than the ability to target pathogens with
      antimicrobial molecules can also contribute to the health benefits
      of probiotics. When tested using an in vivo mouse model for oral
      candidosis, a dose-dependent improvement in symptom score was
      observed for mice dosed with K12 at 24 and 3 h before and at 3, 24
      and 27 h after C. albicans inoculation, when compared with mice in
      a saline-treated group. Follow-up clinical evaluation of the
      efficacy of K12 in candidosis control in humans now seems
      imperative.<br>
      <br>
      Although it is now well established that exposure to probiotic
      bacteria can impact upon the host's immune system, the outcome of
      these interactions can be quite strain-specific. Several in vitro
      cell culture experiments have indicated that strain K12 can help
      to maintain cell homeostasis. In one microarray-based study, it
      was demonstrated that co-culture with either strain K12 or certain
      bacterial pathogens differentially influenced the expression
      levels of 1530 genes in human bronchial epithelial cells.[56]S.
      salivarius K12 altered the expression of 660 genes (572 of which
      were specific to K12) and, in particular, those involved in innate
      immune defense pathways, general epithelial cell function and
      homeostasis, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell development and
      migration, and signaling pathways. In this same study,
      Staphylococcus aureus influenced the expression of 323 genes. The
      ratio of upregulated to downregulated genes was 5:2 for K12, but
      this ratio was reversed for S. aureus, further illustrating the
      different signaling roles of strain K12 and bacterial pathogens.
      Closer analysis of the affected gene pathways indicated that K12
      potentially contributes to the maintainance of homeostasis between
      human and bacterial cells by reducing proinflammatory responses.
      In particular, K12 was shown, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay, to reduce the levels (from 318 to 5.1 pg/ml) of the
      cytokine IL-8 produced by the bronchial cell line in response to
      the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.[56] IL-8 has been
      demonstrated to have a major involvement in the pathogenesis of
      gingivitis and so dosing with strain K12 may potentially help
      ameliorate some of the inflammatory manifestations of this
      disease. The secretion of Gro-α, an inducible neutrophil
      chemotactic factor synthesized in epithelial tissues during
      inflammation, was also inhibited by the presence of strain K12
      when the epithelial cells were exposed to flagellin (a known
      inducer of IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells), further
      emphasizing the protective role strain K12 can play for the host.
      The mechanism of immunosuppression by strain K12 appeared to be at
      least partially explained through the inhibition of activation of
      the NF-κB pathway (a family of transcription factors that function
      as dimers and regulate genes involved in immunity, inflammation
      and cell survival). Interestingly, the most significantly
      over-represented pathway in the array studies was the unified
      interferon signaling pathway. In this pathway, type I and II
      interferons signal through their specific receptors to upregulate
      the expression of a large number of genes responsible for innate
      immunity against viral infection, antitumor activity, priming of
      the LPS response and anti-inflammatory effects. This indicates
      that, while K12 cells can act to reduce inflammation, they may
      also 'prime' the epithelial cells through tonic signaling to
      respond rapidly and appropriately to the detection of viral or
      bacterial exposure in order to limit the spread of infection – a
      role that has recently been ascribed, in general, to commensal
      bacteria.[57]<br>
      <br>
      Other preliminary studies have demonstrated that high-level oral
      dosing with S. salivarius K12 elicits increased salivary levels of
      IFN-γ.[58] These observations were further supported by
      investigations with mouse splenocytes, in which IFN-γ levels, but
      not the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β or TNF-α, were increased
      in response to co-culturing with strain K12 [WALES J ET AL.,
      UNPUBLISHED DATA]. Interestingly, it seems that not all S.
      salivarius elicit similar immune responses, since S. salivarius
      strain ATCC 25975 was reported to upregulate IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α
      gene expression.[59] Indeed, in that study it seemed that strain
      ATCC 25975 was even more efficient at inducing the release of
      proinflammatory mediators than was C. albicans. These apparently
      contradictory findings emphasize the importance of not
      extrapolating the specific findings for one probiotic candidate
      strain to all members of that same species. The initial findings
      of induction by strain K12 of an anti-inflammatory response have
      subsequently been independently corroborated by Guglielmetti et
      al.,[47] who showed that IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels were
      significantly reduced when FaDu cells were co-cultured with K12.
      These findings will be discussed below in relationship to the
      probiotic candidate strain S. salivarius ST3.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, it appears that strain K12 is well suited for use as
      an oral cavity and upper respiratory tract probiotic due to its
      natural propensity to inhabit the human oral cavity and be
      strongly competitive with a number of potential oral pathogens
      that have adapted to the same ecological niche. In addition, the
      immune responses of cell lines to co-incubation with S. salivarius
      K12 indicate that it elicits no proinflammatory response but
      rather an anti-inflammatory response, as well as modulating genes
      associated with adhesion to the epithelial layer and homeostasis.
      By these strategies, S. salivarius K12 appears to be
      well-tolerated on the epithelial surface, while also actively
      protecting the host by BLIS-mediated inhibition of pathogen
      replication and stimulation of cytokine-mediated reduction of
      virus replication and pathogen-induced inflammation and apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>S. salivarius M18</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Some early reports indicated that certain S. salivarius strains
      (especially TOVE-R as aforementioned) may have a role in the
      limitation of dental caries. Following the successful discovery
      and introduction of the probiotic strain K12, BLIS Technologies
      Ltd. conducted extensive follow-up deferred antagonism testing of
      candidate BLIS-producing S. salivarius to identify strains having
      inhibitory spectra that included bacterial species putatively
      associated with the development of dental caries. In this screen,
      S. salivarius strain M18 (formerly known as Mia) was found to
      inhibit all tested S. mutans and S. sobrinus (collectively
      referred to as the mutans streptococci). Other species inhibited
      by strain M18 included: Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces
      naeslundii, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae,
      Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, H. influenzae,
      Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus cohnii.[101] This
      unusually broad spectrum of inhibition indicated that strain M18,
      in addition to potentially reducing the risk of dental caries, may
      also have additional benefits for the host in helping to limit the
      growth of a variety of common bacterial pathogens of the upper
      respiratory tract.<br>
      <br>
      To date, four bacteriocin loci have been identified in the M18
      genome: salivaricin A2,[101] 9,[60] MPS[30] and M.[30] Salivaricin
      A2 and 9 are well-characterized bacteriocins with broad activity
      against S. pyogenes as well as other upper respiratory tract
      pathogens, but not against mutans streptococci. Salivaricin MPS is
      less well characterized, but is known to be a large 60 kDa
      bacteriocin with specific activity against S. pyogenes.[61]
      Salivaricins A2, 9 and MPS have been found to be
      megaplasmid-encoded in strain M18.[16,30] By contrast, salivaricin
      M appears to be chromosomally encoded and, recently, has not only
      been shown to be a lantibiotic, but also to be the molecule
      responsible for the observed activity of strain M18 against mutans
      streptococci.[30] Interestingly, unlike most other S. salivarius
      bacteriocins, salivaricin M appears to be optimally produced in
      vitro on TSYCa agar (trypticase soy broth supplemented with 2%
      yeast extract, 0.1% CaCO3 and 1.5% agar), and less effectively on
      BaCa (blood-containing) agar in deferred antagonism assays, an
      observation indicating that there is strict regulation of its
      locus expression.<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary colonization trials have indicated that, in children
      who colonize well with strain M18, the salivary levels of mutans
      streptococci are maintained at reduced levels for significant
      periods (at least 27 days) by comparison with placebo-dosed
      control subjects, in whom the mutans streptococci levels returned
      to pretreatment levels within 4–6 days.[101,62]<br>
      <br>
      A variety of pathogens have been implicated in the development of
      gingivitis and periodontitis and it has also been shown that the
      etiology of these diseases is strongly linked to the inflammatory
      response of the host cells to the bacterial pathogens.[63,64] To
      determine whether strain M18 can potentially impact on
      pathogen-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in gingival
      fibroblasts, strains M18 and K12 were coincubated with gingival
      fibroblasts both prior to and concommitantly with exposure to
      periodontal pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis,
      Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
      Strains M18 and K12 both significantly inhibited the expression of
      the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and -8, commonly associated
      with gingivitis – indicating that dosing with these probiotics may
      potentially be useful in the treatment of gingivitis.[65]
      Appropriately controlled large-scale clinical trials further
      investigating the potential for M18 probiotic interventions in the
      control of dental caries and gingivitis now appear warranted.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>S. salivarius ST3</b><br>
      <br>
      ...Ability to produce urease was another characteristic assessed
      for each of the candidate probiotic strains. Strains K12 and RS1
      were demonstrated both to be strongly ureolytic, a trait
      considered beneficial due to its effect in reducing the acidity of
      dental plaque and, thereby, possibly delaying the onset and
      progression of dental caries.[70,71] By contrast, strain ST3
      appeared non-ureolytic and, on further examination, was found to
      lack ureC, which encodes the main subunit of the urease
      complex.[18] The authors suggested that the inability to hydrolyze
      urea could be considered beneficial, in that it could result in
      there being less damage to the host's mucosal cells from exposure
      to ammonia. These observations highlight the potential for
      different strains to fulfill different roles in the oral cavity
      and, perhaps, for them to be targeted to applications in
      individuals with specific health needs....<br>
      <br>
      ...Both strains were also found to grow efficiently in milk,
      indicating that fermented milk products may be suitable delivery
      vehicles for the probiotics.[19]<br>

      <b>Future Perspective</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      With the recent rapid expansion in the variety of available
      probiotics and in their delivery vehicles, consumers are
      developing a growing enthusiasm for the health benefits to be
      derived from their consumption. While the majority of probiotics
      have been designed for use in the GI tract, it is clear that there
      is now an impetus to progress the field to encompass other regions
      of the body, including the oral cavity. As this review has shown,
      there are now a number of candidate probiotic strains from the
      species S. salivarius that have been proposed for application to
      the control of microbial diseases of the oral cavity. While the
      safety of S. salivarius for application to humans appears to have
      been well established, there is still only relatively limited
      clinical evidence to support claims of health benefit. Most
      current supporting evidence has been based on either in vitro
      studies or the results of clinical trials that have been limited
      in size. There is no doubt that, in the next few years, the
      benefits to be gained from these probiotics (both in terms of
      health and commercial gain) will provide the incentive for
      clinical studies of sufficient magnitude to clearly establish the
      roles that S. salivarius probiotics can play in the human oral
      cavity, the upper respiratory tract and beyond (Figure 4). It is
      also apparent that, due to strain variation (even in the
      immunological responses that they evoke), individual strains will
      be selected for their specific health benefits which could include
      the prevention of: dental caries; OM; streptococcal sore throat;
      halitosis; oral thrush; general immune priming and potentially
      many more (Table 1). This promises to be a rapidly evolving and
      rewarding research area to observe and to participate in over the
      next decade.<br>

      are not limited to forming part of therapeutic formulations for
      use in controlling, treating, or preventing dental caries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND </b><br>
      <br>
      Dental caries is a disease characterised by dissolution of the
      mineral portion of the tooth. As caries progresses, destruction of
      tooth enamel and dentine occurs followed by inflammation of pulp
      and periapical tissues.<br>
      <br>
      The mutans streptococci (MS) are a cluster of acidogenic, dental
      plaque-inhabiting streptococcal species that are considered the
      principal causative agents of caries. Presently, seven different
      MS species (known as S. mutans, S. rattus, S. cricetus, S.
      sobrinus, S. ferus, S. macacae, and S. downei) are recognised. Of
      these seven species it is mainly S. mutans and S. sobrinus that
      are of significance in terms of human caries.<br>
      <br>
      Over the years various methods have been developed and tried with
      varying results, to prevent or at least alleviate the problem of
      dental caries. Treatments with antibiotics such as penicillin have
      been suggested and are effective but indiscriminately destroy both
      useful and harmful bacteria in the mouth leading to microbial
      imbalances.<br>
      <br>
      In order to minimise disruption to the mouth microflora,
      antibiotic producing organisms have been investigated for their
      ability to inhibit caries. A group of organisms identified as
      having potential in this regard are microorganisms producing
      bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances (BLIS). BLIS producers of
      the genera Streptococcus, Staphylococcus and Enterococcus have
      been screened for potential application to prevention of dental
      caries (Balakrishnan, M. et al., Caries Res. 2001 ; 35: 75-80).<br>
      <br>
      What is sought is a non-virulent analog of the disease-causing S.
      mutans, or a so called effector strain. To serve as an effector
      strain in replacement therapy in bacterial infection, the
      microorganism must be non-virulent itself and able to compete
      successfully with the pathogenic microorganism either via
      competitive action and/or antibiotic action. S. mutans effector
      strains have been identified (Hillman et al. , J Dent Res. 1987;
      66: 1092-4; James and Tagg, N Z Dent J. 1991; 87: 80-3) and show
      strong anti-S. mutans activity. A disadvantage with the use of S.
      mutans effector strains is the cariogenic potential of these
      strains.<br>
      <br>
      S. salivarius is an alternative streptococcus species which avoids
      this disadvantage. In WO 01/27143 S. salivarius strains are
      identified which have utility in the treatment of dental caries
      caused at least in part by S. sobrinus. No activity was recorded
      against MS generally or S mutans in particular. Similarly, in
      Balakrishnan (supra), S. salivarius K3 is identified as active
      against S sobrinus when grown on trypticase soy broth yeast
      extract calcium carbonate agar medium, but had no effect on S.
      mutans.<br>
      <br>
      S. salivarius TOVE-R (Tanzer, J. M. et al.; Infect Immun. , 1985,
      48 : 44-50) is an antagonist strain and which brought about a
      reduction in dental caries. There have been no reports of BLIS
      production by this strain.<br>
      <br>
      The applicants have now identified BLIS-producing S. salivarius
      strains with a broad spectrum of activity against MS dental caries
      causing organisms including S. mutans.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is broadly directed to these novel S.
      salivarius strains, and the use of anti-MS S. salivarius strains
      in the treatment of dental caries, or at least provides the public
      with a useful choice.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention may broadly be
      said to consist in a biologically pure culture of a Streptococcus

      or a culture having the identifying characteristics thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides an extract obtainable from Salivaricin
      A2-producing strains of S. salivarius, which extract has anti-MS
      activity. In particular, the extract has anti-S. mutans activity.
      Conveniently, the extract is obtainable from S. salivarius strains
      Mia or K12.<br>
      <br>
      In a further aspect, the present invention provides an
      antibacterial composition which includes an S. salivarius or
      extract as defined above.<br>
      <br>
      In a still further aspect, the present invention provides a
      therapeutic formulation comprising an S. salivarius or extract as
      defined above, together with a diluent, carrier and/or excipient.<br>

      contacting the MS or S. mutans with an inhibitory effective amount
      of : (i) an S. salivarius extract composition or formulation of
      the invention; or (ii) S. salivarius K12 or an anti-MS or anti-S.
      mutans active extract therefrom, or a composition or formulation
      comprising K12 or an active extract therefrom...<br>
      <br>
      DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br>
      <br>
      As noted above, the present invention is directed in a first
      aspect to Streptococcus salivarius strains which produce
      Salivaricin A2 and which exhibit anti-MS activity. When grown on
      TSBCaYE agar, the S. salivarius strains desirably exhibit activity
      against a broader spectrum of MS including S. mutans. Salivaricin
      A2 and an A2-producing S. salivarius strain (strain K12) are
      described for example in WO 01/27143 incorporated herein by
      reference.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment the invention is directed to S. salivarius
      strain Mia and S. salivarius strains having the identifying
      characteristics thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Strain Mia is distinct from strain K12 in its biochemical
      characteristics as determined using API 20 Strep kit (bioMerieux)
      and API 50 CH (bioMerieux) which allow study of the carbohydrate
      metabolism. The differences are summarised as follows: API 20
      Strep kit MIA K12 p-galactosidase + Alkaline phosphatase-+ API 50
      CH Glycerol-+ anaerobic L-arabinose + a-methyl-D-mannoside-+
      aerobic Inulin + Glycogen + Xylitol + p-gentiobiose + Preferably,
      strains for use in the invention exhibit at least one, preferably
      at least three, more preferably at least six, and even more
      preferably all of the distinguishing biochemical characteristics
      of strain Mia.<br>
      <br>
      Mia also exhibits stronger anti-MS, and in particular stronger
      anti-S. mutans activity than K12.<br>
      <br>
      S. salivarius strain Mia is a BLIS-producing strain with activity
      against other bacteria, particularly streptococci, and more
      particularly MS, including S. mutans. S. salivarius strain Mia was
      deposited with Deutche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen Und
      Zellkulturen GmbH, Mascheroder Weg 1 b, D-38124, Braunschweig,
      Germany on 12 December 2001 and has been assigned Accession No.
      DSM 14685.<br>
      <br>
      As noted above MS are considered the primary causative agents in
      dental caries with S. mutans being of particular significance.
      While BLIS-producing strains of S. salivarius active against
      streptococci have been reported previously, this is the first time
      that BLIS producing S. salivarius active against MS and S. mutans
      in particular, have been identified.<br>
      <br>
      The S. salivarius strains of the invention exhibit broad spectrum
      antibacterial activity, particularly when grown on TSBCaYE agar
      media. The S. salivarius are therefore useful as antibacterial
      agents per se as well as therapeutically. In this
      context,"therapeutic"includes prophylactic treatment. Therapeutic
      uses include the treatment or prevention of microbial infections,
      especially streptococcal infections. The salivarius'of the
      invention are particularly suitable for use against MS and S.
      mutans. Conditions amenable to treatment with the strains or
      extracts of the invention include dental caries, sore throats, and
      bad breath.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also relates to extracts obtainable from salivaricin
      A2-producing strains of S. salivarius and especially from strains
      of the invention. These active extracts may similarly be used in
      therapeutic formulations and methods. Extracts can be obtained
      using known art protocols, conveniently by cell culture and
      centrifugation...<br>
      <br>
      One preferred formulation employs freeze dried S. salivarius of
      the invention in milk powder formulations in a manner similar to
      that previously reported for the preparation of Bifidus Milk
      Powder (Nagawa et al. (1988); J. Dairy Sci. 71: 1777-1782).<br>
      <br>
      One orally administrable formulation of S. salivarius is a blend
      of freeze dried S. salivarius strains with skim milk powder or the
      like which has been flavoured to enhance palatability...<br>
      <br>
      The formulations and compositions of the invention may further
      comprise one or more secondary antibacterial agents. These
      secondary agents may, for example, be antibiotics, or other
      antibacterial agent or antibacterial producing microorganisms.
      Useful antibacterials include nisin, and other BLIS for example.
      Preferably, the secondary antibacterial agent is a BLIS or BLIS
      producing microorganism. The BLIS may be one or more of
      salivaricin A, Al, A2 and B. Other antibacterial microorganisms
      include known S. salivarius such as K12 and K30.<br>
      <br>
      S. salivarius strains of the invention are primarily found on the
      tongue surface. Combinations with S. salivarius that grow in
      dental plaque such as TOVE-R (supra) would be useful...<br>
      <br>
      A currently preferred treatment protocol for dental caries
      comprises pre-treatment by brushing teeth with chlorhexidine gel
      for 2 to 5 days, preferably 3 days. A lozenge is administered 1-4
      hours, preferably 2 hours after the gel. This is followed by
      administration of a further 2-5, preferably 3 lozenges through the
      day at intervals of 1-4 hours, preferably every 2 hours. This
      protocol is followed for 2-4 days to facilitate colonisation. For
      maintenance purposes 1, 2, or 3 lozenges, usually 1 to 2 lozenges
      are taken each day following ordinary tooth brushing. The regime
      is continued for as long as required...<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXPERIMENTAL </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Identification -- Strain Mia was isolated from the oral cavity of
      a healthy adult human subject. It grows on Mitis salivarius agar
      at 37 C, 5% C02 with morphology typical of S. salivarius as
      follows:<br>
      Colony shape and size: round, 1-2 mm in diameter<br>
      Margin (edge): entire (smooth)<br>
      Elevation: convex<br>

      Texture: mucoid When cultivated on either Blood agar or on
      Trypticase soy broth (BBL) + Davis agar 1.5% supplemented with 0.
      1% calcium carbonate the bacterial growth appears relatively more
      firmly adherent to the agar surface than is typical of most S.
      salivarius. The API 20 Strep Identification code for the strain is
      5050451, which corresponds to Streptococcus salivarius (98. 4%
      identity)...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of anti-MS active extract </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One hundred ml of molten Trypticase Soy agar containing 2% yeast
      extract and 0.25% calcium carbonate was poured into a 1 L schott
      bottle. One ml of an overnight culture of S. salivarius MIA, grown
      in Todd Hewitt broth at 37 C, in 5% CO2 in air, was added to the
      bottle. The culture was incubated anaerobically at 37 C for 18-24
      hours. One hundred ml of Trypticase Soy broth containing 2% yeast
      extract and 0.25% calcium carbonate was added to the bottle, which
      had been preincubated under anaerobic conditions. The culture was
      then incubated for a further 24 hours anaerobically at 37 C. The
      broth was centrifuged to remove the bacterial cells and then
      ammonium sulphate was added to 50% (w/v) and incubated at 4 C for
      18 hours. The sample was then centrifuged and the pellet
      resuspended in 1 ml of milli-Q water. Anti-MS activity of the
      sample was then tested using a well diffusion assay in Blood agar
      plates. Fifty 1ll of the sample is added to each well and
      air-dried. The plates were then chloroform treated. An overnight
      culture of the indicator strain was spread over the top of the
      plate and incubated at 37 C, 5% C02 in air, for 18-24 hours...<br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The results above demonstrate the antibacterial effect of S.
      salivarius strains, particularly strain Mia against a broad
      spectrum of microorganisms, particularly streptococci. These
      strains are the first BLIS producing S. salivarius to be
      identified which have activity against MS, and more particularly
      S. mutans. The strains and related active extracts herein
      therefore have application in methods of therapeutically treating
      individuals against the harmful effects of streptococcus
      infection, especially in the oral cavity. These methods include
      treatment of dental caries in which MS or S. mutans are the
      primary causative agent. The S. salivarius extracts and
      compositions of the invention also have application in the
      treatment of bad breath and sore throats.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to methods of inhibiting growth of
      anaerobic bacteria, particularly halitosis causing bacteria, and
      to the use of BLIS-producing Streptococcus salivarius strains,
      extracts thereof, and compositions containing same in the
      prevention or treatment of halitosis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Halitosis or bad breath is a common complaint characterised at
      least in part by the production of volatile sulfur compounds. The
      production of such compounds is generally associated with oral
      bacteria, particularly certain anaerobic species. These bacteria
      generally inhabit oral surfaces, and particularly periodontal
      pockets and the dorsa of the tongue surface.<br>
      <br>
      The primary source of volatile sulphur compounds (VSC's) from the
      subgingival microflora is from microorganisms that can be both
      commensal and pathogenic. Previous culture-based studies have
      indicated that Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia
      (both black pigmented species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Micromonas
      micros (formerly, Peptostreptococcus), Bacteroides species,
      Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Desulfovibrio species,
      Treponema denticola, and Eubacterium species amongst others are
      responsible for the production of VSC's that contribute to
      halitosis (as summarized by Loesche W J, Kazor C. Periodontol
      2000. 2002; 28:256-79. and Khaira N, Palmer R M, Wilson R F, Scott
      D A, Wade W G. Oral Dis. 2000 November; 6 (6):371-5). However,
      recent non-culture healthy or afflicted with halitosis. Atopobium
      pavulum, Eubacterium sulci, Fusobacterium periodonticum,
      Dialister, a phylotype of streptococci, a phylotype of the
      uncultivated phylum TM7, and Solobacterium moorei appeared to be
      present in subjects with halitosis. By contrast, Streptococcus
      salivarius, Rothia mucilaginosa (Stomatococcus mucilaginosus), and
      an uncharacterized Eubacterium (strain FTB41) were commonly
      detected only amongst healthy individuals (Kazor, C. E. et al., J.
      Clin Microbiol, February 2003, pp 558-563).<br>
      <br>
      Over the years various methods have been developed and tried with
      varying success, to prevent or at least alleviate the problem of
      halitosis. Current treatments focus on anti bacterial regimes to
      reduce numbers of oral bacteria, or agents to mask or neutralise
      the offensive odour. Oral rinses with chlorine dioxide (see for
      example, WO 95/27472 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,738,840) have been shown
      to have some effect in the control of halitosis, but offer only
      temporary relief in the order of a few days. Generally, current
      methods of treating halitosis require complex physical, chemical
      or expensive regimes to be carried out and are typically only of
      short term effect, as the malodour-causing oral bacteria recover
      to former levels after treatment is stopped.<br>
      <br>
      What is sought to treat halitosis is the replacement of the
      disease-causing organisms, with a non-virulent commensal
      microorganism. To serve as an effector strain in replacement
      therapy, the microorganism must be able to compete successfully
      with the pathogenic microorganism either via competitive action
      (e.g. for attachment sites), and/or antibiotic action, or
      inhibition by other metabolism-associated by-products.<br>
      <br>
      In WO 01/27143 S. salivarius strains are identified which have
      utility in the treatment of infections of the upper respiratory
      tract caused by streptococcal organisms, including treatment of
      sore throats caused mainly by S. pyogenes, and dental caries
      caused at least in part by S. sobrinus. No activity was recorded
      against any anaerobic microorganisms. Moreover, the treatment of
      halitosis is nowhere contemplated in that document.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is broadly directed to methods of at least
      inhibiting growth of anaerobic microorganisms using BLIS-producing
      S. salivarius strains or compositions comprising same, or at least
      provides the public with a useful choice...<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As noted above, the present invention is directed in a first
      aspect to a method for at least inhibiting the growth of anaerobic
      bacteria sensitive to BLIS-producing S. salivarius. The method
      comprises contacting the sensitive bacteria with an inhibitory
      effective amount of a BLIS-producing S. salivarius, or an extract
      thereof, or a composition containing the S. salivarius or extract
      thereof...<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the S. salivarius strains for use in the invention are
      native Salivaricin B producers with activity against anaerobic
      bacteria, particularly black pigmented species (such as
      Prevotella), Eubacterium saburreum and/or Micromonas micros.
      Salivaricin B BLIS-producing strains with activity against
      anaerobic bacteria include K12, and K30 both deposited with
      Deutche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen Und Zellkulturen GmbH,
      Mascheroder Weg 1 b, D-38124, Braunschweig, Germany on 8 Oct.
      1999, and 8 Oct. 1999, and assigned Accession Nos. DSM 13084 and
      13085 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Strain Sal 20P3 was deposited at the Australian Government
      Analytical Laboratories, 1 Suakin Street, Pymble, New South Wales,
      Australia in July 1992 under Accession No. AGAL 92/32401.<br>
      <br>
      Sal 20P3 is a producer of Salivaricin A only and has activity
      against at least Micromonas. Salivaricin B producers K12 and K30
      have a broader range of activity against black pigmented species,
      Eubacterium and Micromonas at least.<br>
      <br>
      S. salivarius BLIS-producers may be identified by testing
      potential producer strains in agar surface assays as taught in WO
      01/27143. Production of Salivaricin A, A2 and B may be confirmed
      by comparing sequence identity and activity to those sequences and
      activity data given in WO 01/27143. For convenience, the amino
      acid sequences of Salivaricins useful in the invention are as

      The sequence for Salivaricin A1 is also given as a further BLIS
      useful in the invention...<br>
      <br>
      As noted above black pigmented species, Eubacterium and Micromonas
      are considered causative agents in halitosis. While the
      BLIS-producing strains of S. salivarius above are known to be
      active against gram-positive aerobic bacteria, their activity
      against anaerobic bacteria, such as black pigmented species,
      Eubacterium and Micromonas in particular, is unexpected. All the
      more so because BLIS-producing organisms are typically known to
      act against more closely related species.<br>
      <br>
      These BLIS-producing S. salivarius are therefore useful as
      anaerobic antibacterial agents per se as well as therapeutically.
      In this context, “therapeutic” includes prophylactic treatment.
      Therapeutic uses include the treatment or prevention of anaerobic
      microbial infections, especially Eubacterium and Micromonas
      infections, and infections by black pigmented species. The S.
      salivarius are particularly suitable for use against Prevotella
      species including P. intermedia and P. melaminogenica; Eubacterium
      saburreum, Micromonas micros, Streptococcus anginosus, some or all
      of which may be implicated in halitosis. Conditions amenable to
      treatment with the S. salivarius strains include halitosis (or bad
      breath).<br>
      <br>
      Extracts obtainable from the BLIS-producing salivarius strains are
      also useful in the invention. Extracts include those in which the
      BLIS or BLIS' produced by the salivarius strain is/are provided in
      isolated or pure form. An “isolated” BLIS is one which has been
      identified and separated and/or recovered from its natural
      cellular environment. Extracts can be obtained using known art
      protocols, conveniently by cell culture and centrifugation.
      Routine isolation methods include ammonium sulphate precipitation,
      column chromatography (e.g. ion exchange, gel filtration, affinity
      chromatography etc.), electrophoresis, and ultimately,
      crystallisation (see generally “Enzyme Purification and Related
      Techniques”. Methods in Enzymology, 22: 233-577 (1991)). The BLIS
      may be purified as necessary using conventional techniques (see
      for example, Parente, E and Ricciardi, A. Applied Microbiol.
      Biotechnol 52: 628 (1999))..<br>

      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      BLIS-producing S. salivarius strains, particularly salivaricin B
      producing strains are active against a number of microorganisms
      implicated in halitosis (Tables 1, 2 and 6). More particularly,
      the strains are shown for the first time to be active in a
      maintenance regime, that is, for generating a cumulative effect
      against at least some anaerobic halitosis-causing organisms over a
      period of a week or more. This is surprising where generally S.
      salivarius strains are thought to be active against only closely
      related aerobic organisms. Halitosis-causing organisms are
      anaerobic and occupy niches not generally accessed by S.
      salivarius, The strains and related active extracts, formulations
      and compositions herein therefore have application in methods of
      prophylactically or therapeutically treating individuals against
      the harmful effects at least of some Eubacterium and Micromonas
      infections, as well as some black-pigmented colony types,
      especially in the oral cavity. These methods include treatment of
      halitosis in which these organisms are the primary causative
      agents. The S. salivarius extracts and compositions of the
      invention also have application in the treatment of sore throats.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the above description is provided by
      way of example only and that variations in both the materials and
      techniques used which are known to those persons skilled in the
      art are contemplated.<br>
