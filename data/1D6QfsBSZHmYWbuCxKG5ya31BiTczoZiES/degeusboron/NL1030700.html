      This one is for the Petrol Heads : Turbo Charge your car by adding
      Nuclear Fusion to you Combustion Chamber with this newly

      NL1030700<br>
      <br>
      First person to start selling a Lithium hydroxide monohydrate/ and
      Acetone additive or a sodium tetraborate pentahydrate &amp;
      Acetone Fuel additive will make a killing.<br>
      <br>
      NOTE : Dont add too much though, a ratio of 1/1000 additive to
      gasoline will give 50 times more combustion power<br>
      <br>
      Lithium Hydride or Boric Acid to normal petrol or diesel, as the
      temperatures required to trigger a Li-H or B-H fusion reaction are
      easily met inside a normal combustion engine. It does require an
      engine with a compression ratio of 1:11 and preferably somewhere
      around 1:20; that means that the average Diesel engine should be
      able to do it. <br>
      <br>
      "De Geus calculates the energy output of less than 1% of fuel
      additive to yield over 50 times the normal energy output of the
      engine/cylinders. Which would obviously blow up the engine.<br>
      <br>
      "He advises a lot of tuning and tweaking to get the settings
      right. He advises to use a separate tank and fuel feed for the
      additive to avoid settling of components in the mixture inside the
      gas tank and to increase control over the exact amount added. He
      points out that there is no radiation and no waste isotopes, and
      that after over 1000 miles his engine showed no signs of negative
      effects.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a composition of matter for

      </b><br>
      Lithium stearate is well known as a lubricant or lubricating oil

      <br>
      It has now been discovered that lithium stearate and other
      liposoluble organometallic lithium compounds can be used for
      harnessing the hydrogen energy of hydrocarbon fuels.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      One aspect of the present invention concerns a hydrogen energy
      releasing catalyst which comprises a liposoluble organometallic
      salt or salts and a vehicle or diluent thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of the present invention concerns a process for
      preparing the aforementioned catalyst which comprises dissolving
      or dispersing a liposoluble organometallic salt or salts in a
      vehicle or diluent oil.<br>
      <br>
      Another aspect of the present invention concerns a method of using
      the aforementioned catalyst which comprises adding it to a
      hydrocarbon fuel at a specified catalyst-to-fuel ratio according
      to the types of fuel and the combustion devices used. In the case
      of a gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine, the mileage
      increases from 15% to 35%, while in a furnace or boiler, the fuel
      efficiency increases from 20% to 35%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>FIG. 1 is a graph showing the relationship between the
        torque and the number of revolutions of a test engine.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The hydroqen energy releasing catalyst according to the invention
      comprises from 10% to 90% by weight of at least one liposoluble
      organometallic salt or salts and from 90% to 10% by weight of a
      vehicle or diluent thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The liposoluble organometallic salt or salts useful for the
      present invention are composed of a metallic cation and a
      carboxylic acid anion. The carboxylic acids for the invention are
      selected from saturated or unsaturated fatty acids having 2 to 32
      carbons, preferably from 15 to 27 carbons, most preferably from 15
      to 18 carbons. Examples of such carboxylic acids are stearic,
      oleic, and palmitic acids. The metallic cation has a valence of 1
      to 4. Examples of the preferred metal are sodium, potassium,
      lithium, magnesium, aluminum, and silicon.<br>
      <br>
      The organometallic lithium is the principal and most active
      catalytic ingredient capable of harnessing the huge
      physicochemical energy of the hydrogen atom of a hydrocarbon fuel
      at temperatures reached by an ordinary combustion engine or
      furnace. Examples of the preferred organometallic lithium are
      lithium stearate, lithium oleate, and lithium palmitate.<br>
      <br>
      The organometallic magnesium alone requires very high temperatures
      and high heat rates to be an active hydrogen energy catalyst. The
      energy gain by its use alone would be small in an ordinary
      combustion engine or furnace. However, when the organometallic
      magnesium is added to the organometallic lithium in the ratio of
      about 1:2 by weight, there is a greatly improved release of atomic
      hydrogen. This also results in a decrease in the amount of
      pollutants in the exhaust gas. Another benefit of its use is
      improvement in the solubility or dispersibility of the composition
      in a hydrocarbon fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The organometallic aluminum does not participate in the catalytic
      reaction of a hydrocarbon fuel. However, when it is mixed with the
      organometallic lithium and organometallic magnesium in amounts
      about 1/4 by weight relative to the amount of organometallic
      lithium, it increases the pollutant absorbing power and the
      solubility or miscibility of the composition in the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Another optional ingredient is an peroxide oxidant or co-catalyst
      such as lipsoluble benzoyl peroxide or metallic peroxides in
      amounts from 0.1% to 12%, preferably from 1% to 3% by weight of
      the composition, to help speed up the interaction of components of
      the composition for activating them.<br>
      <br>
      The vehicle useful for the invention includes aliphatic,
      cycloaliphatic, parafinic, olefinic and aromatic hydrocarbons, and
      other natural, silicon-based, or silicon-substituted synthetic
      oils, such as castor oil, alkyl glycols, and tetraethylsilane, and
      mixtures thereof. The amount of a vehicle is from 10% to 90%,
      preferably from 60% to 80%, by weight of the composition. The
      preferred aromatic hydrocarbons are of the naphthenic series in
      amounts preferably from 0.1% to 15%, most preferably about 5% by
      weight, of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      The composition of the invention may be prepared by dispersing or
      melting and then blending one or more of the afore-mentioned
      organometallic compounds with one or more of the afore-mentioned
      vehicle oils. The resultant dispersion or solution is then heat
      cycled for a specific time at specific temperatures and pressures
      described below. Finally, it is cooled, and, if desired, other
      ingredients, such as oxidation promoters, are added.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, one or more of the organometallic compounds are
      placed in an autoclave, which is filled with an inert gas, such as
      helium, and heated at temperatures between 50 DEG and 800 DEG F.,
      preferably between 80 DEG and 495 DEG F., most preferably at about
      360 DEG, for melting. Throughout the preparation, the pressure is
      kept at from one to 30 atm, preferably from one to 10 atm. After
      the organometallic compounds are melted, the temperature is
      adjusted to between 250 DEG and 500 DEG F., preferably between 300
      DEG and 360 DEG F, and vehicle components are added and the blend
      held at this temperature for a period of from 5 minutes to 12
      hours, preferably from 15 minutes to 6 hours, most preferably
      about 3 hours. The blend is then subjected to 2 to 10, preferably
      5 cycles of optional heat treatment and subsequent cooling cycles
      of temperatures between 100 DEG and 500 DEG , preferably between
      200 DEG and 350 DEG, most preferably between 250 DEG and 300 DEG
      F., for a period of from 30 minutes to 6 hours, preferably about 2
      hours. The blend is finally cooled to room temperature, and any
      remaining ingredients, such as metallic peroxides, are mixed
      therewith. The viscosity of the resulting blend is lower when the
      temperature and pressure used are higher and when the heat cycles
      are longer.<br>
      <br>
      The composition of the invention may be mixed with a fuel prior to
      or at the time of combustion in amounts of from 0.0001% to 10%,
      preferably from 0.005% to 5%, most preferably from 0.05% to 2% by
      weight of the fuel. In the case of a gasoline or diesel internal
      combustion engine, the mileage increases from 15% to 35%, while in
      a furnace or boiler, the fuel efficiency increases from 20% to
      35%. The use of the composition in amounts above 10% does not
      significantly increase the energy harnessing rate. However, it
      still improves the pollution control and oxygen saving
      capabilities of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism by which the composition of the invention increases
      the energy harnessing rate is as follows: In high temperature
      flames the aforementioned organometallic cation produces P-N-P-N
      or N-P-N-P avalanche reactions releasing high energy ultraviolet
      radiation and electrons accelerated to high kinetic energy states.
      The high energy ultraviolet radiation ionizes the hydrogen atoms
      releasing accelerated, high kinetic energy subatomic protons and
      electrons. These subatomic ions collide with each other and
      convert or "thermalize" this high kinetic energy into infrared
      heat energy. Thus, the high energy ultraviolet radiation is
      converted to useful infrared heat energy. The amount of released
      hydrogen energy can be controlled by either (1) proportioning the
      amount of a composition of the invention added to the hydrocarbon
      fuel, or (2) regulating the rate of fuel feed or other operational
      parameters of the internal or external combustion engine to
      control the flame temperature at which the catalytic ingredient is
      activated. In this way, with the use of a composition of the
      invention, the reflected and measured efficiency of combustion of
      a hydrocarbon fuel can be increased dramatically by combining the
      non-oxidative released energy with ordinary oxidative combustion.
      These non-oxidative released energies are the result of the
      ionization of the hydrogen atom.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, there are even higher levels of harnessable energy
      derived from the subatomic protons and electrons. When these
      ionized subatomic particles (plasmoids) produced by the ionization
      of hydrogen atoms come into close proximity, plasmoid fusion
      occurs. The resulting plasmoid energy is 1836 times as great as
      that produced by the ionization of a hydrogen atom alone. When the
      composition of the invention is added in a sufficient ratio to a
      hydrocarbon fuel in a highly elevated temperature environment,
      there is an exhibited collective behavior of the ionized protons
      and electrons. This collective behavior state occurs when said
      subatomic particles reach a density of 5% or higher. This
      collective behavior is called non-nuclear plasma fusion. The
      amount of energy released in this extremely high energy state is
      proportional to the level of fusion density.<br>

      Examples of the invention will be described below to illustrate
      the invention, and should not be construed as limiting its scope.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Catalyst Composition #1</b><br>
      <br>
      20% by weight of lithium stearate, 10% by weight of magnesium
      stearate, and 5% by weight of aluminum stearate (relative to the
      final composition) were placed in an autoclave which was filled
      with a helium gas. The autoclave was then heated to 425 DEG F. to
      melt the metallic carboxylic acid salts. The pressure was kept at
      5 atm throughout the preparation. After the salts were melted, the
      temperature was adjusted to 325 DEG F. 57% by weight of mineral
      and organic oils and 8% by weight of silicon-based synthetic oils
      (relative to the final composition) were added to the molten salts
      and the mixture was kept at this temperature for 3 hours. The
      blend was then subjected to 5 cycles of heat treatments between
      100 DEG and 360 DEG F. in a period of 2 hours. Finally, the blend
      was cooled to room temperature.<br>

      <br>
      Catalyst #2 of the invention was prepared by repeating Example 1
      except that the amounts of lithium, magnesium and aluminum
      stearates, and vehicle oils used were 16%, 8%, 4%, and 72% by
      weight, respectively.<br>
      <br>

      Catalyst #3 of the invention was prepared by repeating Example 1

      stearates, and vehicle oils used were 12%, 6%, 3%, and 79% by
      weight, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Catalyst Composition #4</b><br>
      <br>
      Catalyst #4 of the invention was prepared by repeating Example 1
      except that only lithium stearate and a mineral oil were used, in
      amounts of 25% and 75% by weight, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of Internal Combustion Gasoline Engine</b><br>
      <br>
      A Ford car having a 302-CID, 4-cycle engine was used to make road
      tests of 10 round trips between Tappan Zee Bridge, NY, and Windsor
      Locks, CT, a distance of about 120 miles. The on-board instruments
      were calibrated to give maximum absolute errors of 0.001 mile and
      0.001 gallon, respectively. Unleaded gasoline was used throughout
      the tests.<br>
      <br>
      The first 5 round trips were made without using any catalyst of
      the invention. The resulting average fuel consumption was 8.28
      gallons per 120 miles or 14.5 miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      The second 5 round trips were made by adding Catalyst #1 of the
      invention to the gasoline fuel in the catalyst-fuel ratio of
      1:1000 by weight. Since the air-fuel ratio necessary for the
      optimal catalyzed fuel operation is lower than that of the
      straight fuel operation because of the physical hydrogen reaction
      occurring with the aid of the catalyst of the invention, the
      air-fuel ratio in the catalyzed fuel operation was reduced so that
      the chemical combustion conditions might be kept equal in both
      types of operation.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting average fuel consumption was 6.3 gallons for 120
      miles or 19.0 miles per gallon. This figure is 31% higher than
      that of the above base line operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of Internal Combustion Gasoline Engine</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 5 was repeated except that the catalyst used and the
      catalyst fuel-ratio were Catalyst #4 and 1:2560, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The resultant fuel consumptions were 6.5 gallons for 120 miles or
      18.6 miles/gallon for the catalyzed fuel operation, which is 28.6%
      higher than the 14.5 miles/gallon for the straight fuel operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of Internal Combustion Diesel Engine</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 5 was repeated except that the test vehicle, the fuel, the
      catalyst and the catalyst-fuel ratio were a Volkswagen Rabbit
      Diesel having a 1.5-liter diesel engine, an aviation fuel "A"
      (cetane rating #50), Catalyst #2, and 1:1250, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The resultant fuel consumptions were 2.7 gallons for 120 miles or
      45 miles/gallon for straight fuel operation and 2.1 gallons per
      120 miles or 57 miles/gallon for the catalyzed fuel operation,
      which is 27% higher than that of the straight fuel operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 8</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of Internal Combustion Diesel Engine</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 5 was repeated except that the test vehicle, the fuel, the
      catalyst and the catalyst-fuel ratio were a GM Oldsmobile having a
      350-CID diesel engine, a diesel fuel (cetane rating #40), Catalyst
      #2, and 1:1500, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The resultant fuel consumptions were 5.8 gallons for 120 miles or
      20 miles/gallon for straight fuel operation and 4.7 gallons per
      120 miles or 25 miles/gallon for the catalyzed fuel operation,
      which is 25% higher than that of the straight fuel operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 9</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of Internal Combustion Diesel Engine</b><br>
      <br>
      A 40-ton trailer truck operated on diesel fuel was used to make
      road tests of two round trips of 1000 miles each. The first round
      trip was made using only diesel fuel having a cetane number of 40.
      The first half of the first round trip (500 miles) was run with a
      full load of 40 tons, while the return trip was performed with a
      half load. The second round trip was made in the same fashion
      using the same type of diesel fuel but mixed with Catalyst #2 of
      the invention at a catalyst-fuel ratio of 1:1500.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting percent fuel savings for the operations with full
      and half loads were 22% and 17%, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The percent fuel saving was calculated as<br>
      100.times.(G1 -G2)/G1<br>
      <br>
      where G1 and G2 are gallons of fuel used in the straight and
      catalyzed operations, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 10</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of External Combustion Boiler</b><br>
      <br>
      A boiler made by the Combustion Engineering Co. was used to
      conduct a series of tests. The boiler efficiency was defined as:<br>
      Boiler efficiency (%)=100.times.S(Es-Efw)/(F.times.H)<br>
      <br>
      where S is the quantity of steam generated per hour, Es and Efw
      are the steam and feed water enthalpies, respectively, F is the
      quantity of fuel oil burned per hour, and H is the quantity of
      heat per gallon of the oil.<br>
      <br>
      The boiler first was operated using #6 Fuel Oil without adding any
      catalyst of the invention. The average readings taken for various
      quantities during the operation were as follows:<br>
      Rate of steam generated: 22,000 lbs/hr<br>
      Steam temperature: 500 DEG F.<br>
      F.W. temperature: 186 DEG F.<br>
      Steam pressure: 175 psi<br>
      Heat rate of the oil: 145,000 BTU/gal<br>
      Boiler
      efficiency=100.times.22,000(1270-154)/(249.times.145,000)=68 (%)<br>
      <br>
      Next, Catalyst #3 of the invention was injected into the burner
      manifold of the boiler at a catalyst-fuel rate of 1:2500, with the
      burner manifold recirculating valve closed. The rates of steam
      generated at 3 different rates of oil used were measured as shown
      in Table 1<br>
      <br>
      <b>TABLE 1</b><br>
      Level Oil consumed<br>
      Steam generated<br>
      Flame temperature<br>
      <br>
      1 185 gal/hr 19,700 lbs/hr<br>
      2100 DEG F.<br>
      2 205 gal/hr 23,300 lbs/hr<br>
      2300 DEG F.<br>
      3 260 gal/hr 30,400 lbs/hr<br>
      2700 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      The boiler efficiency at each level was calculated as:<br>
      B.E.1=100.times.19,700(1270-154)/(185.times.145,000)=82 (%)<br>
      B.E.2=100.times.23,300(1270-154)/(205.times.145,000)87 (%)<br>
      B.E.3=100.times.30,400(1270-154)/(260.times.145,000)=90 (%)<br>
      <br>
      From the above results it is apparent that the use of the catalyst
      of the invention made the boiler efficiency at each operational
      level 20%, 28%, and 32% higher than that of the base line
      operation. It is noted that the boiler was run at the third
      operational level for only a short period of time because it was
      loaded above normal operating level. Unfortunately, the boiler was
      incapable of achieving and maintaining flame temperatures of over
      2800 DEG. The above results, however, showed that as the flame
      temperature increased from about 2100 DEG to 2700 DEG F., the
      boiler efficiency increased from 68% to 90%, indicating that the
      catalyst of the invention became more active at higher
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      In both types of operations, a Hamilton 4-gas analyzer was
      installed to measure the quantities of oxygen, carbon dioxide,
      carbon monoxide, and unburned hydrocarbons in the stack gas. This
      gas analysis showed that the excess oxygen level in the catalyzed
      operation was only 1.5% to 2.5% in contrast to approximately 6% in
      the straight operation. The content of water vapor in the stack
      gas was substantially decreased in the catalyzed operation. This
      substantial decrease in stack water vapor is explained as follows.
      The hydrogen atom is oxidized to form water vapor during the
      normal chemical process known as combustion. However, when the
      composition of the invention is added to a hydrocarbon fuel in the
      proper ratio and above a certain minimum temperature, the hydrogen
      atom ionizes and is no longer available in its native state to
      combine with oxygen to form water vapor. In addition, a fireside
      inspection revealed that the hard deposits built up on the
      inaccessible areas below the steam drum over years had gone. What
      was left in the other areas was also easily washed away with
      running water from a hose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 11</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Torque Test with Internal Combustion Engine</b><br>
      <br>
      A 327-CID Chevrolet engine with four barrel carburetor was
      installed on a dynamometer. First, six power pulls were made at
      around the factory specification point without using any catalyst
      of the invention. The measured torques are shown in Table 2.<br>

      6 5300 170 177<br>
      <br>
      The correction factor was 1.028 based on a dry bulb reading of 104
      DEG F., a wet bulb reading of 76 DEG F., and a barometric reading
      of 30.54. During the test, the water temperature of the engine
      remained at 190 DEG F., the oil temperature, read at one of the
      external filters, was also 190 DEG, and the oil pressure was 50
      psi.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the engine was brought to an idle, and one pint of Catalyst
      #1 of the present invention was put into 20 gallons of gasoline in
      the tank. The engine was idled for five minutes to prime it with
      the catalyst, then 16 pulls were made. (The reason so many pulls
      made here is that the test operators were at first incredulous
      about the results, and every effort was made to find accurate
      figures.) A correction factor of 1.033 was used based on a dry
      bulb reading of 108 DEG F., a wet bulb reading of 76 DEG F., and a
      barometric reading of 30.55. The readings of torque are shown in
      Table 3.<br>

      From Table 4, it is evident that the average horsepower in the

      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Dispensing means for dosing a liquid fuel tank of an internal
      combustion engine with a unit dosage of colloidal magnesium metal
      dispersed in kerosene comprising a container, cap metering valve
      at the container bottom and a delivery line from the outlet of the
      valve between the fuel pump and the carburetor or air injector.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>(A) Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention lies in the field of making unit dosage packages of
      colloidal sols by arc sputtering of pure magnesium metal and is
      for the purpose of improving the metering of critical low
      concentrations of colloidal magnesium in gasoline, diesel fuel and
      jet aircraft fuel. The invention also lies in the field of
      portable dispensing devices for delivering colloidal magnesium as
      an ignition additive as pure magnesium to the conventional
      hydrocarbon fuel of an internal combustion engine in a vehicle, in
      particular automobile, diesel or jet aircraft piston engines, in
      which the additive is prepared by arc sputtering. Dispensing may
      be directly into the fuel tank or into the fuel line between the
      fuel pump and the carburetor. The invention serves the need of
      providing a more practical method at lower cost to supply critical
      concentrations in my prior patent applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(B) Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The prior art literature and text books recognize arc sputtering
      devices for creating colloidal suspensions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(1) Prior Art Showing Arcing of Electrodes to Make Colloids:</b><br>
      <br>
      The manufacture of colloids is shown in Brown, U.S. Pat. No.
      1,910,212, and shows arc sputtering between silica electrodes or
      selenium electrodes to make the non-conductive material conductive
      in the presence of a reducing agent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(2) Prior Electrical Devices for Cracking Fuel:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Electrical devices for upgrading liquid hydrocarbon fuels are
      known and may be in a form for attachment to an automobile. Some
      of these devices work on the principal of cracking the hydrocarbon
      fuel into fractions by the action of electricity, for example U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,011,843, which vaporizes fuel by passing electrical
      current fed by the car storage battery into an emulsion of
      gasoline or water.<br>
      <br>
      Another example of electric treatment apparatus intended to break
      down gasoline into higher octane fractions is found in U.S. Pat.
      No. 1,992,310 which uses an electrolytic treatment of gasoline in
      a cell containing sulfuric acid electrolyte, a platinum anode and
      a lead cathode.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(3) Prior Apparatus for Space Charge Cracking of Hydrocarbon:</b><br>
      <br>
      A further example is the apparatus in U.S. Pat. No. 2,766,582 in
      which an electrical space charge is created in the fuel prior to
      spraying the fuel through a nozzle in the form of a jet stream.<br>
      <br>
      Still another example is U.S. Pat. No. 3,556,976 in which the
      apparatus cracks low grade gasoline into gaseous products which
      are fed into the internal combustion chamber of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(4) Prior Art Showing Metal and Metalloid Additives:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In Grebleck et al, U.S. Pat. No. 2,927,849, there is disclosed
      particles of magnesium less than 20 microns with alkali metal in a
      liquid hydrocarbon medium used as a jet fuel in the after burner
      of a jet propulsion device (Column 2, lines 5 through 20). Example
      V of this patent shows 20 micron magnesium particles (200 parts)
      mixed with oleic acid (1 part) and polyethylene (6 parts) to make
      a dispersion of uniformly dispersed magnesium in the fuel of the
      after burner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PROBLEMS OF GRINDING METAL SUSPENSIONS TO FORM COLLOIDS IN
        INVENTOR'S PRIOR PATENT APPLICATIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      In my prior patent applications, mentioned above, there is
      disclosed and acknowledged the methods of grinding colloids in a
      colloid mill and by a grinding device specifically exemplied in
      WB-1 wherein a 400 mesh magnesium powder is reduced to colloidal
      dimensions. The recoveries of properly dimensioned colloidal
      product is low, the procedures are very lengthy, and the practical
      implementation of the inventions at low cost and in high
      production is seriously impaired. It is well accepted in the
      grinding art that high energy requirements, expensive equipment
      and highly expert personnel are needed to achieve colloidal
      dimensions by simple fracture and comminution, especially with
      highly ductive metal such as pure magnesium.<br>
      <br>
      Although the art of arc sputtering metals to form sols is known
      for about 100 years, there has never been heretofore suggested
      that by indexing the electrodes which are in the form of elongated
      rods of uniform cross section into 1/2 inch scribed markings which
      are visible to the naked eye, one can sputter away a predetermined
      length, filter the product and produce by a simple ingenious
      method a predetermined dosage in a unit dosage package.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DIFFERENCES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION OVER THE PRIOR ART</b><br>
      <br>
      No prior literature or patent shows indexed electrodes for arc
      sputtering to prepare a unit dosage package of fuel additive. No
      prior art shows the dispenser for the package into the fuel system
      of an automobile, diesel truck or jet aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      An object of the invention is to provide an improved arc
      sputtering magnesium colloid manufacturing apparatus mounted in a
      liquid hydrocarbon carrier, preferably kerosene, for the
      preparation of colloidal magnesium sol in an inert hydrocarbon
      suspending agent and is uniquely useful as a unit dosage package
      for the injection of the colloidal magnesium suspension into the
      fuel supply or into the fuel line between the fuel tank and the
      carburetor of an internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the invention is to provide an arc welder and
      sputtering electrode combination wherein sputtering magnesium
      electrodes generates colloidal magnesium sol from the pure metal
      rods to create a unit dosage package carrying the magnesium
      suspension into the fuel line or fuel supply of an internal
      combustion engine for improved combustion of the fuel.<br>

      practice in automobiles, diesel trucks, and jet aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>(a) Unit Dosage of Sol by Arc Sputtering Scribed Portions:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In an example of the new method and apparatus for manufacturing
      colloidal magnesium sol by arc sputtering, 1/4 inch square cross
      section rods of pure magnesium about 8 to 12 inches long are
      scribed from the bottom at 1/2 inch intervals and the rods mounted
      as electrodes in 500 ml of dry kerosene in a container. The rods
      are fitted as electrodes to an arc welder, the current adjusted to
      1/2 to 1 amp and then the electrodes are sputtered until each
      electrode loses two 1/2 inch sections from each bottom rod. The
      black sol immediately produced is contaminated with about 40% to
      60% solidified droplets of irregular shape which are easily
      removed by filtering through cotton or fiberglass, thereby
      providing a sol with about 1.7 grams in 500 cc. By sputtering
      additional 1/2 inch sections the concentration of sol can be built
      up to 3 to 4 grams.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(b) Dispensing of Unit Dosage into Fuel Lines of Gasoline
        Engines, Diesel Engines, or Jet Aircraft Engines:</b><br>
      <br>
      The unit dosage colloidal magnesium sol dispensing apparatus is
      mounted either over the fuel tank or near the carburetor to
      proportion sol in the fuel. If mounted under the hood of an
      automobile or similar internal combustion engine powered vehicle
      the unit dosage package permits gravity flow of magnesium sol
      prepared by arc sputtering directly into the fuel line between the
      fuel tank and the carburetor of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      One unit package of 500 cc is the optimum dosage at 1.7 grams of
      sol for each ten gallons of gasoline, leaded or unleaded,
      dispensed into the fuel tank or fed into the carburetor. In diesel
      fuel, the optimum dosage is increased, e.g., one 1000 cc unit
      package totalling 2.0 grams of sol is optimum for fifteen gallons
      of diesel fuel. In jet fuel, the optimum dosage is substantially
      more than in gasoline, e.g., one 5000 L cc package of 3 to 4 grams
      of sol for each 12 gallons of jet fuel.<br>
      <br>
      At 2 to 3 units consumed between markings 28 in FIG. 3, e.g., 1/2
      inch units, the amount of colloidal magnesium sol produced is
      about 1.6 to 1.7 grams. At 2 to 3 units between markings 28a,
      e.g., 1/4 inch units, the amount is about 0.8 grams.<br>
      <br>
      By adjusting the volume for optimum dosage, volumes of 5000 cc for
      jet aircraft convert about 6 to 8 units 28 and volumes of 1000 cc
      for diesel fuel convert about 4 to 5 units 28. Of course, the sol
      should be measured for each case by evaporating kerosene.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(c) Dispenser Means:</b><br>
      <br>
      The dispenser, which consists of a predetermined volume of
      colloidal magnesium sol in a concentration required for either
      gasoline, diesel or jet aircraft engines operating with high
      octane fuel, is in a container of a size which holds this
      predetermined volume. A stop cock metering valve is threadedly
      fitted into the bottom of the container for direct flow into the
      fuel tank or into the fuel line through a T fitting between the
      fuel pump and the carburetor.<br>

      <b>PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTAL PREPARATION OF SOL BY ARC SPUTTERING</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Prior to perfecting the apparatus for carrying out the invention,
      the first attempt at arc sputtering employed two 1/4 inch square
      cross section rods of pure magnesium which were held in two
      laboratory rubber covered clamps, rubber being used for
      insulation, (not shown in FIG. 1. because the clamps were found to
      be cumbersome and were discarded) each mounted on a ringstand in a
      V relation from the two ringstands, said clamps being placed to
      immerse the rods in a beaker at an angle of 10 to 15 degrees. The
      rods were immersed to a depth of about two inches in about 500 ml
      round bottom beaker partially filled with kerosene.<br>
      <br>
      The leads from an arc welder 10 as in FIG. 1. were attached to the
      left rod 25 and the right rod 27 by clips in a manner similar to
      the attachment of clips 25c and 27c in FIG. 1. When the current
      was turned on from the arc welder 10 in FIG. 1 and adjusted to
      about 1 ampere the arc formed quickly and heated the tip of each
      rod to a molten state dropping 3 to 4 mm. sperical beads of pure
      shiny magnesium to the bottom of the beaker. Simultaneously, a
      dense black colored cloud quickly filled the kerosene in the
      beaker, obliterating the view of the two bottom tips in the V
      position. After about 10 to 12 seconds the arc sputtering
      operation was stopped, the bead product filtered and weighed, and
      it was found that only about 2% to 3% of sol was formed with the
      product being mostly beads. The yield of colloidal magnesium sol
      was so low that further experiments were made.<br>
      <br>
      The next attempt changed the round beaker to a rectangular
      transparent container to determine if the arc sputtering could be
      visually monitored after the initial black sol cloud formed at the
      tips. It was found that agitation was necessary and the placement
      of two stirrers to sweep across the front of the V tip where the
      arc forms effectively permitted visual observation and adjustment
      of the electrodes. By trial and error it was found that the
      initial angle of the V at 15 to 20 degrees was too small and that
      the angle should be between 22 and 30 degrees, preferably about 25
      degrees, in order to permit even arcing at low amperage from the
      arc welder. In this manner the black colloidal magnesium sol was
      produced in amounts 8 to 10 times the first experiments and
      instead of 95% of solidified shiny droplets, about 40% to 60% of
      solidified droplets 2 to 4 mm. in diameter of magnesium were
      formed as byproduct.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>(a) Arc Sputtering Method and Apparatus:</b><br>
      <br>
      The preferred apparatus is shown in FIG. 1 and comprises a
      transparent rectangular tank 12 of inert insulating material,
      preferably glass or transparent thermoplastic, partially filled
      with a predetermined amount of liquid kerosene 29 into which the
      electrodes of pure magnesium are immersed. These comprise a left
      electrode 25 and a right electrode 27.<br>
      <br>
      Pure magnesium is readily available as commercially pure magnesium
      at a purity of 99.9% mg. with less than 0.003% aluminum and copper
      impurity, about 0.03% or less of iron impurity, about 0.08%
      manganese impurity, about 0.001% nickel impurity and about 0.005%
      silicon impurity.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferred to use round 1/4 inch rods about 14 inches long as
      the electrodes, but successful experiments were also run with 1/4
      inch square cross sections cut out from 14 inch wide 1/4 inch
      thick stock.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated in the early experiments described herein:<br>
      <br>
      (1) visual monitoring of the arc which created the colloidal sol
      was found to require a critical placement of the rods of between
      about 1/2 to 11/4 inches, spaced from the inner transparent edge
      of the shorter side wall; and<br>
      <br>
      (2) a critical angle of between about 22 degrees and 30 degrees,
      preferably 25 degrees, was required in order to provide the
      smallest amount of loss under conditions of agitation by placing
      two mixers 14 and 16 on opposite sides of the V rod. Mixer 14 is a
      left electric motor fitted mixer and mixer 16 is a right electric
      motor fitted mixer.<br>
      <br>
      The rectangular container 12 has flat upper edges to adapt the
      mounting of the cross bar holding means 19, used for suspending
      the right and left mixers 14 and 16 and the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      In order to position the left electrode 25 and the right electrode
      27 at the critical angle 26 between about 22 and 30 degrees,
      preferably about 25 degrees, support members 22 and 24 are
      provided for the left electrode 25 and the right electrode 27
      respectively. These support members 22 and 24 are shaped as a
      staggered and backward Z, e.g., an annular base portion, an
      annular top portion and a mid portion. The bottom of 22 or 24 is
      an annular base portion which serves the mounting function for the
      bottom of the electric motor of the left motor fitted mixer 14 or
      of the right motor fitted mixer 16. The top annular portion is for
      suspending the left electrode 25 or the right electrode 27 at the
      critical angle of between about 22 and 30 degrees. To this end the
      top annular portion is bent obliquely upward in a direction away
      from the base.<br>
      <br>
      The support members 22 and 24 are formed of suitable insulating
      material, rubber or plastic, to provide safe operation and assure
      proper electrical assembly.<br>
      <br>
      To properly mount the left and right electrodes 25 and 27 in the
      upper annular portion of the holding means 24, effectively
      constituting an arm of 22 and 24 respectively, a close fitting
      insulating mounting ring is secured within the said annular arm.<br>
      <br>
      After the left and right electrodes 25 and 27 are mounted at the
      preferred angle of about 25 degrees, clips 25c and 27c from the
      arc welder 10 are fitted to the electrode tops as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      The arc welder is a Lincoln arc welder with the adjustments for
      voltage cut down to 70 volts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(b) Operation of Arc Sputtering:</b><br>
      <br>
      With the fitted electrode already described positioned about 5/8
      inch from the transparent front edge and as shown in FIG. 2, the
      creation of the arc ocurs under 70 volts DC at a separation of
      about 1/4 inch while the arcing is continued for 30 to 45 seconds,
      during which time the mixers drive away the black cloud of sol
      particles created at the arc to permit visual observation.<br>
      <br>
      In this 45 second interval about 1/4 to 3/8 inch of magnesium rod
      is consumed from the bottom of each electrode.<br>
      <br>
      During operation, the operator, wearing heavy gloves, needs only
      once to gently push down each rod to maintain the gap at about 1/4
      inch.<br>
      <br>
      If the gap goes beyond 3/8 inch more beads form which cuts down
      the yield of the sol.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of a number of trial runs it was discovered that,
      based upon the density of the 99.9% magnesium electrode which is
      1.74 grams per cubic centimeter, about 1/4 inch of the 1/4 inch
      rod is consumed at each about 2 minute interval operating at the
      slowest possible rate, a rate required to prevent excessive
      formation of magnesium globules.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that the arc under the cooling conditions afforded
      by mixing by the high speed rotation of propellers 15 and 17
      adjacent and along the precise site of formation of molten
      magnesium (melting temperature of about 650 degrees centigrade)
      creates a vapor phase dispersion of colloidal magnesium particles,
      each of these particles being surrounded by liquid kerosene which
      is non-conducting and relatively inert. In short, the arc creates
      a plasma of very fine particles of colloidal dimensions of
      magnesium metal which would tend to agglomerate and coelesce with
      other particles to form larger particles if there were not
      immediate mixing and cooling.<br>
      <br>
      Observation of repeated runs provided the basis for an indexing
      discovery, namely, scribing the bottom portion of the magnesium
      rod at 1/4 inch intervals could serve as a rough indication of the
      concentration of magnesium sol produced. About 1/4 inch intervals
      of magnesium corresponds to about 1/2 the amount required as a
      unit dosage for gasoline in my copending application, Ser. No.
      569,320.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that the propellers must be placed below the arc
      to create vigorous high mixing forces and drive away the sol
      particles as soon as they are formed. Also, the placement of the
      propellers behind the electrodes is of importance to achieve the
      optimum "dispersion freezing effect" of the colloidal particles of
      magnesium sol. As shown in FIG. 2, an optimum spacing 19D exists
      between the bottom tip of the electrode and the shaft of the
      propeller 17, this optimum distance being about 11/2 inches, e.g.,
      between about 1 inch and 2 inches, with the propeller 17 or 15
      being about 1/2 to 1 inch, preferably about 3/4 inch, below the
      bottom tip.<br>
      <br>
      A further improvement for process control of the rate of electrode
      rod consumption of electrodes 25 and 27 is based upon the
      discovery that scribing of 1/16 inch apart markings 30 on an
      electrode, e.g., 27 as shown in both FIGS. 2 and 3, permits an
      indexing of these markings above the top arm of the mounting 24.
      Thus, at a selected rate of 1/2 inch, bottom consumption of the
      electrode 27 in FIG. 3, e.g., the markings 28 in FIG. 3, in a time
      interval of 2 minutes, the manual downward push adjustment need
      only be 1/16 downward push in each uniform 15 second interval.
      This feature of scribing at the bottom of electrode 27 as well as
      at the top facilitates maintaining production at the optimum
      condition. Markings 28a are 1/4 inch apart.<br>
      <br>
      In the manner just described the critical concentrations for my
      prior patent applications are as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Application<br>
      Date of Type of Optimum Unit<br>
      Kerosene<br>
      Serial No.<br>
      Filing Fuel Dosage Volume<br>
      569,320 4/17/75 Motor 1.7 grams 500cc gasoline<br>
      568,999 4/17/75 Diesel 2.0 grams 1000cc fuel<br>
      568,998 4/17/75 Aircraft 3-4 grams 5000cc jet fuel<br>
      <br>
      <b>(c) Filtering and Quality Control:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After the desired concentration is achieved the apparatus of FIG.
      1 is turned off. To guarantee quality control, the liquid and its
      contents are filtered through cellulose, wool or glass wool, the
      beads separated and weighed, the amount of electrode rod consumed
      noted and the amount of sol determined by sampling an adequate
      portion of the total and evaporating the sample to dryness. The
      weight of the sample recovered relates to the whole in the
      proportion of the adequate amount to the total product. In this
      manner the above concentrations are obtained and packed in glass
      containers of the required size, e.g., 500 cc, 1000 cc and 5000
      cc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(d) Dispensing Means:</b><br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates a preferred form of dispensing means comprising
      a dispenser 36 for the fuel tank of an automobile, the dispenser
      36 having as its contents a unit package of 500 cc, 1.7 grams of
      colloidal magnesium, which has been transferred to the interior
      container portion. The bottom left hand part of dispenser 36 is
      threadedly fitted with stop cock metering valve 38. The inlet to
      the stop cock metering valve 38 is at the bottom portion and the
      outlet flows directly into the fuel tank 32 of the automobile. The
      mounting of the dispensing means embodiment for the trunk of the
      automobile is shown in a better view in FIG. 5 where the relative
      portion before the mounting boss 40 and the curved filler line 34
      through which the tank is filled at the gas station is illustrated
      to demonstrate the importance of separating the dosing operation
      from the gas tank filling operation at the gas station. Note that
      the dispenser of boss 40 at the base of valve 38 is at least half
      of the width of the tank and sufficiently far away from the curved
      filler line to prevent splashing the bottom of the valve. These
      locations permit partial or complete dosing of the fuel in the
      fuel tank 32 to assure that the optimum concentration of 1.7 grams
      is added for each 10 gallons of gasoline, whether said gasoline is
      leaded or unleaded.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 5, and in FIG. 3 as well, the fuel of which the
      required amount of magnesium colloid is added from the dispenser
      36 passes through fuel line 42, through fuel pump 44 and then into
      the carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      If it is desired to add 1/2 or 3/4 the amount of colloidal
      magnesium because the tank is 1/2 or 3/4 filled, based upon a 10
      gallon filling, the stop cock metering valve can readily adjust
      the amount to be added. Refilling the dispenser 36 requires
      removing the top cap and added the needed amount, 500 cc,.<br>
      <br>
      Under the hood dispensing is shown in FIG. 6 wherein the location
      of the dispenser 36 is now moved under the hood of the vehicle,
      either a gasoline or diesel powered vehicle. The dispenser 36 is
      compact enough to fit easily under the hood into T 38 between the
      fuel pump 44 and the carburetor 46.<br>
      <br>
      A similar design arrangement for the dispenser 36 can be made in
      carrying out the dispensing method of the invention using
      electrical arc sputtered colloidal magnesium in kerosene for
      improving the performance of an aircraft piston engine or for an
      aircraft jet engine. The dispenser may be used to dose the fuel
      tank or the fuel line.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the above description, it is seen that the electrical
      arc sputtering preferred apparatus provides an easily controlled
      yet ingenious method of producing 0.5 grams up to 4.0 grams per
      liter of magnesium sol for easy dispensing into the engine of a
      land vehicle, marine vehicle or aircraft.<br>

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KING SAMUEL<br>
      <br>
      A gasoline and petroleum fuel supplement formed of a combination
      of ingredients including a lower alkanol selected from the group
      consisting of methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol,
      i-propyl alcohol and mixtures thereof and an alkali metal
      hydroxide selected from the group consisting of sodium hydroxide,
      potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and mixtures thereof. These
      ingredients may be added in various ratios to gasoline and/or to
      water, preferably distilled or deionized water, for use as fuel
      supplements for internal combustion engines.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a new gasoline and petroleum fuel
      supplement for use in internal combustion engines which results in
      or causes more complete combustion of the fuel in the engine and a
      reduction in the overall amount of pollution emitted from the
      engine exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      Some reasons for present inefficiencies of gas as fuel in the
      present internal combustion engine include that the gasoline vapor
      is diluted with about 68 times its volume of air, 4/5 of which is
      inert nitrogen taking no part in the reaction, but rather tending
      to hinder and retard the combustion. This mixture under ordinary
      pressure would not burn, much less explode. The compression of
      this mixture before explosion can be taken to be about 80 pounds
      per square inch owing to the risk of premature ignition. Explosion
      then takes place with such rapidity that its diluting action of
      the inert nitrogen prevents complete combustion. Results of the
      incomplete combustion thus caused are low efficiency, carbon
      deposits in the engine, unburned blow-by vapors of poisonous
      gases, hydrocarbons, monoxides and the like which now attend the
      present gasoline powered motor.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that a temperature of about 1200 DEG C. is needed to
      ignite the ordinary gasoline and air mixture at atmospheric
      pressure. At the moment of explosion, such portions of
      hydrocarbons as do not happen to be in contact with the proper
      quantity of oxygen required for their combustion, owing to the
      hindering action of the inert nitrogen, undergoes changes of
      various complexity. The result is that the products of combustion
      contain not only products of complete combustion but also the
      products of incomplete combustion. These are formed by the heat at
      the moment of explosion and these products combined with
      lubricants provide odors associated with gasoline motors and also
      deposit films of carbon on the inside of the cylinders.<br>
      <br>
      Prior art patents relating to internal combustion engines and
      novel fuel compositions therefor are shown, for example, in the
      patents to Brent U.S. Pat. No. 3,765,848 relating to a motor fuel
      composition; Skala U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,798 for an internal
      combustion engine fueld by NAK; Osborg U.S. Pat. No. 4,081,252 for
      a method of improving combustion of fuels and fuel compositions;
      Records U.S. Pat. No. 1,684,686 describing an aqueous liquid fuel;
      Lee U.S. Pat. No. 4,088,454 for a method for producing a liquid
      fuel composition; and Michaels-Christopher U.S. Pat. No. 4,110,082
      for a reformed hydrocarbons and alcohols from fuel alloys and
      reforming agents.<br>
      <br>
      The present fuel supplement is a newly created formulation of
      chemicals which may be combined with gasoline and/or water to
      provide more complete combustion when used with gasoline in the
      present day internal combustion engine. The present mixture and
      ratio between the ingredients and the amount of gasoline is
      determined by the construction of the motor, weight of the vehicle
      and conditions of operation.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be understood that the various chemicals and water,
      preferably distilled or deionized water, as described herein may
      be mixed in various desirable proportions in accordance with
      different internal combustion engines, and various features
      thereof including compression ratios, weights and other varying
      factors.<br>
      <br>
      The present supplement provides increased gasoline mileage of up
      to 50% or more. It produces a gaseous vapor which causes the
      blow-by vapors in the engine to burn more completely when they
      become united in the motor. Consequently, the normally harmful,
      dangerous and wasted hydrocarbons and other gases as well as the
      inert nitrogen gases which are currently wasted, burn more cleanly
      during combustion.<br>
      <br>
      This provides a reduced level of air pollution from internal
      combustion engines and reduces oil contamination.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the supplement provides cleaner engine parts due to a
      cooler running cycle, less carbon deposits inside the engine as
      well as less gases entering the crank case to contaminate the oil.
      This produces some expected longer life of oil, parts and engines.
      The supplement reduces combustion heat and allows engines to run
      cool and, in some instances, may possibly reduce the gasoline
      octane rating required for internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel supplement is formed of a combination of essential
      ingredients in the following relative proportions: 250 to 3,000 ml
      of a lower alkanol, such as methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol,
      n-propyl alcohol, i-propyl alcohol or mixtures thereof, and 0.75
      gr to 120 gr of an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium
      hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide or mixtures
      thereof. The sodium hydroxide and/or potassium hydroxide and/or
      lithium hydroxide may be added to the lower alkanol ingredients in
      solid form in the above stated proportions or may, in the
      alternative, be added in the form of an aqueous solution. When an
      aqueous solution of the hydroxides is used, the solutions may
      comprise, for example, from about 150 to 4,000 g/l of the
      respective hydroxides. Obviously, the size of the batch of fuel
      supplement produced is a matter of choice so long as the relative
      proportions of ingredients is maintained as stated above.<br>
      <br>
      When the above ingredients forming the supplement are mixed
      together, the total mixture is then mixed either with gasoline or
      with water. In a preferred embodiment, the above ingredients are
      mixed with distilled or deionized water. When the supplement is
      mixed with the distilled or deionized water, the final product
      comprises from about 1/4 to about 3/4 by volume supplement and the
      remainder water. When the supplement is mixed with gasoline, the
      product comprises from about 70 to about 95% by volume of
      supplement and from about 5% to about 30% by volume of gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      Either of these mixtures may be injected or otherwise added to the
      carburation system of an internal combustion engine, for example,
      at the PCV valve, carburetor intake manifold or to each cylinder.
      A carburetor intake manifold converter may also be used to inject
      and vaporize the supplement. Alternately, the supplement may be
      added directly to the gasoline in the fuel tank. It has been found
      that adding to the fuel tank approximately one ounce of supplement
      per gallon of fuel achieves the desired results.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the invention will be appreciated more fully in
      view of the following examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <br>
      A fuel supplement was added in a 1968 Pontiac Le Mans Sedan having
      a 350 V8 engine weighing 3,620 pounds registered weight. The
      supplement was formed by mixing approximately 33% by volume of
      supplement with 66% distilled water. The supplement was prepared
      by mixing 1,000 ml of methyl alcohol, 1,000 ml of ethyl alcohol,
      7.5 gr of sodium hydroxide and 7.5 gr of potassium hydroxide. The
      mixture was added slowly to the distilled water in the above
      proportions. The supplement was added to the intake manifold
      through the PVC line and the supplement was vaporized and the
      gaseous vapors were added through the carburetor to the combustion
      chamber using the intake manifold converter. The mileage increased
      from 15 miles per gallon, without using the supplement, to 25 to
      30 miles per gallon with the supplement.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 1 was repeated except that the supplement was added
      through the positive crank case ventilation system. A similar
      increase in mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 1 was repeated except that an additional 1,000 ml of
      methyl alcohol was used in place of the ethyl alcohol of Example
      1. A similar increase in mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 1 was repeated except that the ethyl alcohol and sodium
      hydroxide were deleted from the supplement. A similar, but
      slightly lower increase in mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 5</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 1 was repeated except that the ethyl alcohol and potassium
      hydroxide were deleted from the supplement. A similar increase in
      mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 1 was repeated except that the potassium hydroxide was
      deleted from the supplement, and the supplement was formed by
      mixing approximately 50% by volume of supplement with 50%
      distilled water. A similar increase in mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 7</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 6 was repeated except that the ethyl alcohol portion of
      the supplement was replaced with n-propyl alcohol. A similar
      increase in mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 8</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 6 was repeated except that i-propyl alcohol was used in
      place of the mixture of n-propyl alcohol and methyl alcohol. A
      similar, but slightly lower increase in mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 9</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 5 was repeated except that potassium was used in place of
      sodium hydroxide. A similar, but slightly lower increase in
      mileage was evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 10</b><br>
      <br>
      Example 5 was repeated except that lithium hydroxide was used in
      place of sodium hydroxide. A similar increase in mileage was
      evidenced.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that gasoline octane ratings, driving and
      highway conditions will cause some variances in the miles per
      gallon when the supplement is used with the gasoline in various
      vehicles.<br>

      <br>
      <b>[0003] (b) Description of the Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Conventionally, removal of soot and clinker in a furnace

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0008] The present invention provides a fuel additive composition
      comprising 8 to 40 parts by weight of hydrogen peroxide, 8 to 40
      parts by weight of an amine-based stabilizer, 10 to 40 parts by
      weight of borax, 16 to 40 parts by weight of sodium hydroxide, and
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The composition is prepared by dispersing it in water, so
      that the content of the composition with respect to water ranges
      from 1:2 to 1:50 by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The fuel additive composition is added at 0.02 to 0.5 parts
      by weight per 100 parts by weight of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The composition may further comprise methyl alcohol or a
      surfactant, in which the content of the composition to them ranges
      from 1:1 to 1:3 by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The composition may further comprise one or more catalysts
      selected from the group consisting of potassium carbonate, calcium
      carbonate, and sodium carbonate, in which the content of the
      composition to a catalyst ranges from 1:0.03 to 1:0.3 by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention also provides a method of preparing a
      fuel additive composition, comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      [0014] mixing 16 to 40 parts by weight of sodium hydroxide in an
      aqueous solution in which 10 to 40 parts by weight of borax has
      been dissolved;<br>
      <br>
      [0015] adding 8 to 40 parts by weight of an amine-based stabilizer
      to the resultant mixture; and<br>
      <br>
      [0016] adding 8 to 40 parts by weight of hydrogen peroxide to the
      resultant mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The present invention further provides a use of the fuel
      additive composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more
      detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The fuel additive composition of the present invention
      comprises hydrogen peroxide, an amine-based stabilizer, borax,
      sodium hydroxide, and water, and it facilitates combustion of
      fuel, thereby leading to complete combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Hydrogen peroxide generates oxygen radicals, and thus
      facilitates combustion of fuel. Oxygen radicals are oxygen in an
      atomic state, and they are very unstable. Thus, they exist for a
      very short time and are highly reactive. In the composition of the
      present invention, hydrogen peroxide generates oxygen radical,
      thereby facilitating combustion of fuel fed into the furnace and
      the combustion tube. Therefore, the fuel may burn easily even with
      a small amount of oxygen. Also, the oxygen radicals reduce NOx
      (thermal NOx) and prevent generation of PM (particulate matter)
      such as SOx and CO in a combustion apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Because hydrogen peroxide produces oxygen radicals or
      oxygen molecules even at room temperature, glycerin or an
      amine-based stabilizer is used to inhibit it. As a result,
      radicals are generated in a large amount at about 400[deg.] C.,
      which facilitates combustion of fuel. At about 800[deg.] C. or
      above, oxygen radicals from borax facilitate combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The amine-based stabilizer is selected from the group
      consisting of dimethanolamine, diethanolamine, trimethanolamine,
      and triethanolamine.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Using the amine-based stabilizer, decomposition is retarded
      even up to about 180[deg.] C. or higher. At about 180[deg.] C. or
      higher, oxygen radicals are generated in a large amount, so that
      combustion of the fuel is facilitated even with a low oxygen
      content. The amine-based stabilizer also prevents low-temperature
      corrosion and increases dispersibility in the aqueous solution,
      thereby reducing differences of specific gravity of the matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Borax, or hydrated sodium borate (Na2B4O7.10H2O), excludes
      soot, clinker, and sludge from the furnace of the combustion
      apparatus, thereby increasing thermal conduction efficiency, and
      prevents corrosion of the furnace, thereby extending the furnace
      life.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Part of the borax mixed in the fuel is decomposed to
      generate oxygen radicals, but intact borax is deposited on the
      furnace surface to form a film, thereby preventing corrosion at
      elevated temperatures, reducing viscosity of ash, removing PM such
      as soot, clinker, and sludge, improving thermal efficiency, and
      reducing air pollutants (dust, smoke, NOx, and SOx). If used in a
      combustion apparatus, oxygen radicals generated from the fuel
      additive composition of the present invention reduce generation of
      thermal NOx, and sodium included in the mixture forms sodium
      sulfate, so that SOx exhausted to the air is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Borax, which is powder, is added to and dissolved in water.
      However, because deposition may occur over time, sodium hydroxide
      and the amine-based stabilizer are added to increase solubility of
      the borax in water and prevent the deposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The fuel additive composition is prepared by dispersing 8
      to 40 parts by weight of hydrogen peroxide, 8 to 40 parts by
      weight of borax, 10 to 40 parts by weight of the amine-based
      stabilizer, and 16 to 40 parts by weight of sodium hydroxide, in
      water. The content of the composition to water ranges from 1:2 to
      1:50 by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] If the content of the components falls outside this range,
      combustion may be retarded, which causes an increase of fuel use,
      and cleansing power may be reduced or deposition may occur during
      dispersing.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The fuel additive composition may further comprise
      potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate to
      reduce smoke generation during combustion. They induce
      low-temperature combustion thereby reducing NOx generation, and
      control flame size during combustion thereby improving the radiant
      heat transfer system and reducing fuel consumption. The content of
      the composition of the present invention to the additive ranges
      from 1:0.03 to 1:0.3 by weight.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The content of the fuel additive composition of the present
      invention may be controlled appropriately depending on the kind
      and quality of fuel, operation status of the furnace, and degree
      of aging. Preferably, it is added at 0.02 to 0.5 parts by weight
      per 100 parts by weight of fuel. The fuel additive composition
      enhances cleansing power and prevents low-temperature corrosion
      and high-temperature corrosion.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The fuel additive composition of the present invention is
      prepared by the steps comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0032] mixing 10 to 40 parts by weight of borax in an aqueous
      solution in which 16 to 40 parts by weight of sodium hydroxide
      have been dissolved;<br>
      <br>
      [0033] adding 8 to 40 parts by weight of an amine-based stabilizer
      to the resultant mixture; and<br>
      <br>
      [0034] adding 8 to 40 parts by weight of hydrogen peroxide to the
      resultant mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Borax is added at 50 to 95[deg.] C. to maximize its
      solubility, and hydrogen peroxide is added at the last step to
      appropriately control the oxygen radical content. If hydrogen
      peroxide is mixed along with borax in the first step, oxygen
      radicals are generated excessively, so that foaming occurs and
      oxygen radicals are lost. Also, the temperature of the resultant
      fuel additive composition is elevated, which makes further
      processing complicated and dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, or sodium carbonate
      is added after addition of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Any solid, liquid, or gas fuel may be used in the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] For example, a solid fuel such as coal, coke, and charcoal,
      a liquid fuel such as gasoline, kerosene, light oil, heavy oil,
      coal tar, oil sand, oil shale, methanol, and ethanol, and a
      gaseous fuel such as natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas,
      hydrogen, and acetylene may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The fuel additive composition of the present invention
      burns carbon particles (e.g. coal) before ashing, thereby
      preventing coagulation of carbon particles with ashes and altering
      film formation of borax and the viscosity of ashes, so that
      deposition of clinker, soot, and sludge in the furnace can be
      prevented.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Particularly, under the reducing atmosphere in the furnace,
      the ashing point is decreased. The fuel additive composition of
      the present invention checks a decrease of the ashing point by
      oxygen radicals, thereby preventing clinker generation. Also,
      borax, which penetrates into the pores of coal, prevents
      coagulation of ashes by a glass bead reaction. Undecomposed borax
      is deposited on the furnace surface to form a film, thereby
      preventing high-temperature corrosion, interfering with clinker
      deposition, and enhancing thermal efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In a preferred embodiment, if the fuel additive composition
      of the present invention is employed in a gas boiler, it prevents
      generation of sludge and reduces energy consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In a gas boiler, fine dust included in air which has been
      taken in for combustion, may be hardened by whitening and the like
      to form solid materials like sludge to a thickness of about 1 to 2
      mm. When the fuel additive composition of the present invention is
      used, it decreases the melting point and flashing point, thereby
      removing the sludge or preventing sludge generation. For example,
      when the fuel additive composition of the present invention was
      dispersed in water in a proportion of 1:40 and employed in a 20
      ton/H gas/oil combined rotary boiler of H apartment, the flame
      turned an orange color and elongated, and about 5% of energy
      consumption was saved.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In another preferred embodiment, if the fuel additive
      composition of the present invention is employed in a gas turbine,
      it removes dust attached to the blade of the turbine. The dust
      induces vibration when the gas turbine is operated at high speed.
      The fuel additive composition of the present invention removes the
      dust and rapidly burns dust and soot, thereby enabling effective
      high-speed operation and offering about 2% of thermal efficiency
      improvement.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In another preferred embodiment, the fuel additive
      composition of the present invention may be mixed with light oil
      for a diesel engine to reduce energy consumption. To be specific,
      the fuel additive composition is mixed with light oil for a diesel
      engine along with methyl alcohol or a surfactant. As a result,
      dust generation during combustion can be reduced and about 9% of
      energy consumption can be saved.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In another preferred embodiment, the fuel additive
      composition of the present invention is dispersed in water to
      increase the Hardgrove grindability index (HGI) of fine coals by
      about 10%, reduce ash generation by facilitating combustion, and
      enable recycling of coal ashes. Also, if the composition is
      sprayed to or mixed with coal, briquettes, coke, or charcoal,
      combustion is facilitated and smoke and noxious smells can be
      significantly reduced. Especially, when potassium carbonate is
      mixed with the composition, smoke generation is reduced,
      low-temperature combustion is facilitated thereby decreasing
      discharge of such noxious exhaust gas as NOx, and the radiant heat
      transfer system is improved during combustion of gas fuel, thereby
      leading to reduced fuel consumption.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In another preferred embodiment, the fuel additive
      composition of the present invention may be a simple salt treated
      in a cement kiln to improve combustion rate per unit area of a
      kiln and reduce clinker productivity. In general, combustion rate
      is determined by flame length. The fuel additive composition of
      the present invention induces complete combustion and thus reduces
      flame length. And, in the case of porous coal fuel, borax
      penetrates deep into the pores of the coal and generates oxygen
      radicals at elevated temperatures. A melting point decrease and
      porosity enhancement by calcium carbonate- or sodium carbonate
      increases a contact area of oxygen thereby increasing the
      combustion rate, reducing flashing temperature, and reducing smoke
      generation from a Ringelmann turbidity of level 3 to level 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In still another preferred embodiment, the fuel additive
      composition of the present invention is employed in an oil boiler
      to induce complete combustion of fuel, thereby reducing fly ash,
      improving dust collecting efficiency, and extending catalyst life
      of a dust collector. To be specific, when the composition was
      sprayed into the combustion chamber of an oil boiler while being
      dispersed in water, about 3% of fuel consumption was saved and
      sludge inside the boiler was removed. Also, generation of dust and
      smoke was reduced and scale and sludge generated in the pre-heater
      was removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Thus, the fuel additive composition of the present
      invention may be used for a combustion apparatus to remove scale,
      to prevent corrosion, soot generation, clinker generation, and
      sludge generation, and to control flames.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Hereinafter, the present invention is described in more
      detail through examples. However, the following examples are only
      for the understanding of the present invention and they do not
      limit the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0050] 30 kg of borax and 20 kg of sodium hydroxide were dissolved
      in 50 kg of water at 70[deg.] C. Then, 20 kg of triethylamine, 20
      kg of hydrogen peroxide, and 10 kg potassium carbonate were added
      to prepare a fuel additive composition. The resultant fuel
      additive composition experienced no precipitation or deposition of
      borax, and remained as a stable aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0051] A fuel additive composition was prepared as in Example 1,
      without using sodium hydroxide. The resultant composition
      experienced precipitation as time went by.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0052] A fuel additive composition was prepared as in Example 1,
      at a temperature of 40[deg.] C. The resultant composition
      experienced precipitation as time went by.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0053] A fuel additive composition was prepared as in Example 1,
      at a temperature of 45[deg.] C. The resultant composition
      experienced precipitation as time went by, as in Comparative
      Examples 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 4</b><br>
      <br>
      [0054] 30 kg of borax, 20 kg of sodium hydroxide, and 30 kg of
      hydrogen peroxide were dissolved in 50 kg of water at 70[deg.] C.
      Then, 20 kg of triethylamine, 20 kg of hydrogen peroxide, and 10
      kg potassium carbonate were added to prepare a fuel additive
      composition. The temperature of the resultant fuel additive
      composition rapidly rose to 100[deg.] C. as time went by. This is
      because of excessive generation of oxygen radicals, which is
      caused by addition of hydrogen peroxide.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>Energy Efficiency Test</b><br>
      <br>
      [0055] An energy efficiency test was performed for the composition
      of Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Coal having a moisture content of 1.73%, an ash content of
      14.73%, and a volatile content of 30.12% (calorific value=6,977
      kcal; ash fusion temperature (FT)=1,588[deg.] C.), and a boiler
      having a steam production capacity of 10 ton/h were used. The
      boiler was operated under a pressure of 8 kPa with a load of 80%.
      As a result, 16.8% of coal consumption was saved.<br>

      </b><b>Fuel Consumption Saving Test</b><br>
      <br>
      [0058] The composition was employed in a combined heat and power
      plant using bituminous coal. Fuel consumption saving effect due to
      reduction of air pollutants and clinkers was determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The composition was diluted to about 1,000:1, based on the
      coal weight, in water, and sprayed on lump coal placed on a coal
      feeder. The lump coal was crushed to 200 mesh or below and burnt
      with a burner.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A boiler having a steam production capacity of 120 ton/h
      and Chinese Tatong bituminous coal (calorific value=6,600 kcal/kg;
      ash fusion temperature=1,180[deg.] C.; sulfur content=0.8%) were
      used. Fuel consumption was 300 ton/h and temperature inside the
      furnace was 1,300 to 1,700[deg.] C. A horizontal firing type
      burner and a natural circulation type boiler were used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0061] A. Air Pollutants Generation Reduction Effect</b><br>
      <br>
      [0062] Dust content, SOx concentration, NOx concentration, and CO
      concentration were measured for 4 weeks.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] 1. Dust content: Measured with a cylindrical filter. Before
      addition of the composition, average dust content was 19.4
      mg/cm&lt;2&gt; . It decreased by about 47.0%.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] 2. SOx concentration: Measured by precipitation titration
      method. SOx concentration decreased by about 10.2%.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] 3. NOx concentration: Measured by zinc 1-naphthyldiamine
      method. NOx concentration decreased by about 13.0%.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] 4. CO concentration: Measured by nondispersive infrared
      analysis method. CO concentration decreased by about 27%.<br>
      <br>
      [<b>0067] B. Fuel Efficiency Improvement Effect</b><br>
      <br>
      [0068] Fly ash content decreased from 30.8% to 13.0%, which is
      about 57.8%.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Additionally, the content of bottom ash, one of the
      clinkers, decreased from 59.0% to 25.0%, which is about 57.6%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0070] C. Clinker Removal Effect</b><br>
      <br>
      [0071] Although the coal used in the test had a lower ash fusion
      temperature of 1,180[deg.] C. than those commonly used (1,300 to
      1,400[deg.] C.), no clinker was observed on the furnace wall or in
      the super heater. Also, there was no fouling.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Testing Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Fuel Consumption Saving Test</b><br>
      <br>
      [0072] The following test was performed to confirm clinker removal
      and thermal efficiency improvement.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The composition diluted in water was sprayed on crushed
      coal. The proportion of coal, water, and the composition was
      1000:10:1. The mixture was sprayed on lump coal on a coal feeder.
      The coal was crushed to 200 mesh or below and burnt with a burner.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The coal had a moisture content of about 2.36%, an ash
      content of about 27.89%, and a volatile content of about 17.97%. A
      horizontal firing type boiler was used. Steam production capacity
      was 220 ton/hr, and vapor pressure was 9.8 MPa. The temperature
      inside the furnace was 1,500[deg.] C. to 1,700[deg.] C., the air
      ratio was about 4.8, the combustion exhausting temperature was
      120[deg.] C., and the vapor temperature was about 540[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0075] A. Fuel Saving Effect</b><br>
      <br>
      [0076] Coal to which the fuel additive composition of the present
      invention had been added was used for 14 days. 76,710 tons of
      vapor were produced with 9,786.54 kg of coal. When only coal was
      used for 15 days, 68,462 tons of vapor were produced with 9,910.58
      kg of coal. Therefore, the fuel additive composition of the
      present invention offers better fuel efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0077] B. SOx Reduction Effect</b><br>
      <br>
      [0078] Exhaust gas reduction effect with time was evaluated for
      coal to which the composition of Example 1 (C1) had been added,
      and the composition (C2) which had been prepared by adding 10 wt %
      (10 kg) of potassium carbonate and to which no additive had been
      added.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The test condition was as follows. The results are shown in
      FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Measuring device: Test 350M/XL (manufactured by TESTO)<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Measuring method: Static potential chemical type<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Measuring device type approval number: ASGAM-2001-6
      (National Institute of Environmental Research)<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Measuring device performance test report: Prepared by Korea
      Testing Laboratory<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In FIG. 1, #1 and #2 (---, ---) show SOx discharge when the
      composition of Example 1 was not added. --- is when C1 only was
      added, --- is when 10 wt % of C2 was added along with C1, and ---
      is when 15 wt % of C2 was added along with C1.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Using the fuel additive composition of the present
      invention, fuel exhaust gas discharge decreased from about 1,100
      ppm to about 600 ppm on average. Therefore, SOX reduction effect
      was about 45%.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] C: Fine Particle removal in Fly Ash<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Fine particle content was measured for 6 days for Boiler
      No. 1 to which the composition of the present invention had been
      added, and Boiler No. 2 to which the composition had not been
      added.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Fine particle content of Boiler No. 1 was 7.39% and that of
      Boiler No. 2 was 8.76%. Thus, fine particle content was decreased
      by about 15.64%.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] As described above, the fuel additive composition of the
      present invention reduces dust, SOx, and NOx generation and
      induces complete combustion thereby reducing fuel consumption, and
      prevents soot, clinker, sludge, and corrosion in a combustion
      apparatus, thereby enhancing heat transfer efficiency and
      improving operation stability.<br>
