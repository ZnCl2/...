      <p><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Dew Ponds ~</font></font></b><a
          name="dewponds"></a> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The water collectors known as "dew ponds"
        were invented in prehistoric times, but the technology is nearly
        forgotten today. A few functional dew ponds can still be found
        on the highest ridges of England's bleak Sussex Downs and on the
        Marlborough and Wiltshire Hills, and connected to castle walls.
        They always contain some water that apparently condenses from
        the air during the night. Gilbert White described a dew pond at
        Selbourne (south of London), only 3 feet deep and 30 feet in
        diameter, that contained some 15,000 gallons of water which
        supplied 300 sheep and cattle every day without fail. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investigations by UNEP (1982) and by Pacey
        and Cullis (1986) determined that the ponds do not catch
        significant amounts of dew, but actually were filled mainly by
        rainfall. Pacey and Cullis may, however, have confused dew
        precipitation with rainfall --- two different processes. The
        ponds may also collect fog. (Ref 18) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward A. Martin proved that dew ponds are
        not filled by precipitated dew because the water usually is
        warmer than the air, so no dew could be deposited. He concluded
        that mist condenses on the water already in the pond, or else
        the grass collects dew which gravitates to the bottom and forms
        a pond. Both mechanisms probably are active. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ancient question, "Does dew rises from
        the soil by evaporation or precipitates by condensation from the
        air?" first was posed by Aristotle. John Aitken proved in 1885
        that dew rises or falls as conditions allow. He also determined
        the favorable conditions for the formation of dew: (1) a
        radiating surface, (2) still air, and (3) moist, warm earth. The
        ability of materials to capture dew depends on their specific
        heats. The best material is swan's down, followed by flax or
        cotton, silk, paper, straw, wool, earth, charcoal, silica sand,
        and powdered chalk. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arthur J. Hubbard described a dew pond in
        his book<i> Neolithic Dew-Ponds and Cattleways</i> (1907): </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There is [in England] at least one
        wandering gang of men... who will construct for the modern
        farmer a pond which, in any suitable situation in a sufficiently
        dry soil, will always contains water. The water is not derived
        from springs or rainfall, and is speedily lost if even the
        smallest rivulet is allowed to flow into the pond. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The gang of dew-pond makers commence
        operations by hollowing out the earth for a space far in excess
        of the apparent requirements of the proposed pond. They then
        thickly cover the whole of the hollow with a coating of dry
        straw. The straw in turn is covered by a layer of well-chosen,
        finely puddled clay, and the upper surface of the clay is then
        closely strewn with stones. Care has to be taken that the margin
        of the straw is effectively protected by clay. The pond will
        eventually become filled with water, the more rapidly the larger
        it is, even though no rain may fall. If such a structure is
        situated on the summit of a down, during the warmth of a summer
        day the earth will have stored a considerable amount of heat,
        while the pond, protected from this heat by the non-conductivity
        of the straw, is at the same time chilled by the process of
        evaporation from the puddled clay. The consequence is that
        during the night the warm air is condensed on the surface of the
        cold clay. As the condensation during the night is in excess of
        the evaporation during the day, the pond becomes, night by
        night, gradually filled. Theoretically, we may observe that
        during the day, the air being comparatively charged with
        moisture, evaporation is necessarily less than the precipitation
        during the night. In practice it is found that the pond will
        constantly yield a supply of the purest water. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The dew pond will cease to attract the dew
        if the layer of straw should get wet, as it then becomes of the
        same temperature as the surrounding earth, and ceases to be a
        non-conductor of heat. This practically always occurs if a
        spring is allowed to flow into the pond, or if the layer of clay
        (technically called the 'crust') is pierced." </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional construction details were
        explained in <i>Scientific American</i> (May 1934): </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "An essential feature of the dew-pond is its
        impervious bottom, enabling it to retain all the water it
        gathers, except what is lost by evaporation, drunk by cattle, or
        withdrawn by man. The mode of construction varies in some
        details. The bottom commonly consists of a layer of puddled
        chalk or clay, over which is strewn a layer of rubble to prevent
        perforation by the hoofs of animals. A layer of straw is often
        added, above or below the chalk or clay. The ponds may measure
        from 30 to 70 feet across, and the depth does not exceed three
        or four feet.” (Figures 39 &amp; 40)(Ref. 19) </p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward A. Martin also described their
      construction in his book <i>Dew Ponds</i> (London, 1917). In
      particular, he notes that in order to ram the clay and puddle the
      surface, horses are driven round and through the pond for several
      hours. The base of the pond is planted with grass; without grass,
      the pond dries up. Trees and brush are planted around the pond to
      provide shade.
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The simplest form of dew pond is used in
        Cornwall, where areas of about 40 square feet are prepared on
        mountain slopes by coating the ground with clay and surrounding
        it with a small wall. The clay is covered with a thick layer of
        straw that collects dew during the night. Straw is said to be
        more effective than grass for the purpose. Since the straw is
        moist both day and night, it rots quickly and must be replaced
        frequently.(Ref. 20) </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his book, <i>The Naturalist on the
          Thames</i>, published circa 1900, C. J. Cornish gave a
        description of British dew ponds, excerpted here: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The dew ponds, so called because they are
        believed to be fed by dew and vapours, and not by rain, have
        kept their water, while the deeper ponds in the valleys have
        often failed. The shepherds on the downs are careful observers
        of these ponds, because if they run dry they have to take their
        sheep to a distance or draw water for them from very deep wells.
        They maintain that there are on the downs some dew ponds which
        have never been known to run dry. Others which do run dry do so
        because the bottom is injured by driving sheep into them and so
        perforating the bed when the water is shallow, and not from the
        failure of the invisible means of supply. There seem to be two
        sources whence these ponds draw water, the dew and the fogs... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The fogs will draw up the hollows towards
        the ponds, and hang densely round them. Fog and dew may or may
        not come together; but generally there is a heavy dew deposit on
        the grass when a fog lies on the hills. After such fogs, though
        rain may not have fallen for a month, and there is no water
        channel or spring near the dew pond, the water in it rises
        prodigiously... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The shepherds say that it is always well to
        have one or two trees hanging over the pond, for that these
        distil the water from the fog. This is certainly the case. The
        drops may be heard raining on to the surface in heavy mists.” </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cornish quoted Gilbert White’s <i>Journal</i>
        of May, 1775:“’[I]t appears that the small and even the
        considerable ponds in the vales are now dried up, but the small
        ponds on the very tops of the hills are but little affected’.
        Can this difference be accounted for by evaporation alone, which
        is certainly more prevalent in the bottoms? Or, rather, have not
        these elevated pools some unnoticed recruits, which in the night
        time counterbalance the waste of the day? " These unnoticed
        recruits, though it is now certain that they come in the form of
        those swimming vapours from which little moisture seems to fall,
        are enlisted by means still not certainly known. The common
        explanation was that the cool surface of the water condensed the
        dew, just as the surface of a glass of iced water condenses
        moisture. The ponds are always made artificially in the first
        instance, and puddled with clay and chalk. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Mr. Clement Reid… notes his own experiences
        of the best sites for dew ponds. They should, he thinks, be
        sheltered on the south-west by an overhanging tree. In those he
        is acquainted with the tree is often only a stunted, ivy-covered
        thorn or oak, or a bush of holly, or else the southern bank is
        high enough to give shadow. ‘When one of these ponds is examined
        in the middle of a hot summer's day’, he adds, ‘it would appear
        that the few inches of water in it could only last a week. But
        in early morning, or towards evening, or whenever a sea-mist
        drifts in, there is a continuous drip from the smooth leaves of
        the overhanging tree. There appears also to be a considerable
        amount of condensation on the surface of the water itself,
        though the roads may be quite dry and dusty. In fact, whenever
        there is dew on the grass the pond is receiving moisture’. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Though this is evidently the case, no one
        has explained how it comes about that the pond surface receives
        so very much more moisture than the grass. The heaviest dew or
        fog would not deposit an inch, or even two inches, of water over
        an area of grass equal to that of the pond. None of the current
        theories of dew deposits quite explain this very interesting
        question. Two lines of inquiry seem to be suggested, which might
        be pursued side by side. These are the quantities distilled or
        condensed on the ponds, and the means by which it is done; and
        secondly, the kind of tree which, in Gilbert White's phrase,
        forms the best "alembic" for distilling water from fog at all
        times of the year. It seems certain that the tree is an
        important piece of machinery in aid of such ponds, though many
        remain well supplied without one.” </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An improved form of traditional dew pond was
        invneteded by A.J. Hubbard, <i>et al</i>., and granted British
        Patent # 13,039 (1 March 1905), "Improvements in Reservoirs for
        Collecting Dew". The complete specification is as follows: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For the purpose of securing water supply in
        the absence of rainfall, springs, or streams, reservoirs adapted
        to collect dew have been constructed by excavating the ground
        over an area and to a depth sufficient to form a basin of
        adequate capacity and providing the same with a compound lining
        comprising a bed of straw as a non-conductor and a superimposed
        water-tight layer of clay. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The action of such a reservoir depends on
        the fact that the non-conducting layer of straw prevents the
        tendency to the equalization of temperature of the clay layer
        and water to that of the earth. The water, cooled by radiation,
        consequently retains the coldness so caused, and the temperature
        of the air in contact with it is reduced below the dew point.
        Consequently the water vapour in the air condenses and collects
        in the reservoir. Such reservoirs as heretofore constructed,
        however, have been comparatively inefficient, and, unless on
        chalk, liable to destruction by moisture, worms, or other
        causes, disadvantages which it is an object of this invention to
        obviate, for which purpose, according thereto the basin is
        provided with a lining possessing both impermeable and
        non-conducting properties. In practice this can be
        advantageously effected by the use of a compound lining
        comprising two layers of impermeable material with interposed
        material that is non-conducting or is a bad conductor of heat.
        In order that the non-conducting property of the lining be not
        impaired it is necessary that the lining should be so formed
        that the non-conducting material cannot become wet. For this
        reason when absorbent non-conducting material is interposed
        between two layers of impermeable material, the two layers of
        impermeable material are continuously joined a the edges in a
        watertight manner. For the purpose of increasing the evaporation
        and consequently reducing the temperature of the surface upon
        which the water vapour is to be condensed, a water-retaining
        cover is preferably superimposed upon the upper layer of
        impermeable material. Where necessary owing to the character of
        the soil, a solid foundation is formed in the basin upon which
        the lower layer of impermeable material is laid. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The drawing shows, diagrammatically, in
        vertical section, by way of example, a reservoir for dew
        according to this invention, in which <i>a</i> is a concrete
        foundation, <i>b</i> a layer of asphalt, <i>c</i> a layer of
        asbestos, <i>d</i> a second layer of asphalt having its edge
        joined to that of the lower layer <i>b</i> as at <i>e</i> so
        as to completely enclose the asbestos <i>c</i>, and thus
        prevent it becoming wet and its non-conducting property becoming
        impaired; <i>f</i> is a layer of bricks of a porous nature
        which are rapidly cooled to a low temperature owing to the
        evaporation of the water absorbed by them; <i>g</i> is a stone
        curb which serves to prevent the edges of the lining being
        damaged. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In some cases the concrete foundation a may
        be dispensed with, as also the porous bricks <i>f</i>." </p>

      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another form of dew pond was invented by
        S.B. Russell in the 1920s. According to the description in <i>Popular









          Science</i> (September 1922), "A dew reservoir 30 feet square
        will collect 24,000 gallons of water in a year, or an average of
        120 gallons daily during the hot summer months and 50 gallons
        daily for the remainder of the year... </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Russell reservoir consists of a
        concrete cistern about 5 feet deep, with sloping concrete roof,
        above which is a protective fence of corrugated iron which aids
        in collecting and condensing vapor on the roof and prevents
        evaporation by the wind. The floor of the cistern is flush with
        the ground, while sloping banks of earth around the sides lead
        up to the roof. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Moisture draining into the reservoir from
        the low side of the roof maintains the roof at a lower
        temperature than the atmosphere, thus assuring continuous
        condensation. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At one side of the reservoir is a concrete
        basin set in the ground. By means of a ball valve, this basin is
        automatically kept full of water drawn from the reservoir."

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Already, the search for
      remedies to what it is feared will be the direst water shortages
      in southern England since the summer of 1976 (despite May being
      unusually wet) has led to discussion in the House of Commons of
      scenarios that sound like science fiction, including icebergs
      towed from the Arctic Ocean, and a giant desalination plant on the
      Essex coast. <br>
      <br>
      Yet nothing could be simpler than a dew pond.<br>
      <br>
      These small ponds can be found scattered across the downs,
      wherever sheep and cattle traditionally went for summer grazing,
      in Hampshire, Sussex, the Peak District and Yorkshire. Surviving
      ponds probably number at least 500 across the country, although
      they are often overgrown nowadays, their banks badly trampled by
      livestock, serving as little more than picturesque havens for
      butterflies or a romantic spot for picnicking ramblers.<br>
      <br>
      But they still have a magical and highly significant property."
      People have noticed that they rarely run dry, even in the hottest
      summer, and it is apparent that, during the night, they receive a
      supply of water sufficient to counter-balance the great drags that
      are made upon them by cattle and evaporation," notes Edward
      Martin, in a research paper entitled <span style="font-style:
        italic;">Dew Ponds: History, Observation and Experiment.</span><br>
      <br>
      The great mystery is where the water that fills them up at night
      can come from. These ponds -- also known as "mist ponds" or "fog
      ponds" lie on the downs far above the level at which streams begin
      to form, nor does any piped-water supply reach them. The name "dew
      pond" is the clue. <br>
      <br>
      According to folklore, it is the overnight dew itself, falling on
      the round-backed downs and on the ponds themselves, that keeps
      them full, whatever the weather.<br>
      <br>
      If that really is the case, then surely water companies and the
      government should be thinking not only of mega-projects such as a
      national water grid to bring down water from Scotland, but also of
      encouraging farmers in suitable areas to harvest the dew with new
      ponds. <br>
      <br>
      Dew ponds could even be something that a house owner, with a big
      enough garden and on high enough land, might see as a fashionable
      eco-friendly accessory to match his heat-exchanging borehole or
      roof-top windmill. Far better, after all, than relying on
      standpipes.<br>
      <br>
      To create a dew pond is relatively simple. According to Jackson
      House, a Somerset-based pond builder with 50 years' experience in
      the business, "the secret of making one is to insulate it so that
      the water remains colder than the earth beneath. That means that
      when the dew is falling, it hits the cold surface of the pond and
      drops its own moisture. In the old days, people used to put down
      layers of straw and layers of clay in the bottom, which worked the
      same as a thermos flask". He estimates the cost of digging a
      typical 10yd by 10yd dew pond, and of lining it with a tough
      waterproof layer laid over an insulating geo-textile blanket,
      would work out at no more than &amp;pound;12,000.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, it was a more romantic and much tougher task back at
      the turn of the century when the last specialist gangs were
      creating them by hand in the age-old way, as this description in
      the Wiltshire Gazette of December 29, 1922, goes to show: "Up to
      ten years ago, the dew pond makers started upon their work in
      September, and they toured the country for a period of six or
      seven months, making in sequence from six to fifteen ponds in a
      season of winter and spring. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "The laying of the floor is then proceeded with from the centre,
      called the crown, four or five yards in circumference, and to this
      each day a width of about two yards is added. <br>
      <br>
      "Only so much work is undertaken in one day as can be finished at
      night, and this must be covered over with straw. No layering may
      be done in frosty or inclement weather. And this is the method of
      construction: 70 cart loads of clay are scattered over the area.
      The clay is thoroughly puddled, trodden and beaten in flat with
      beaters, a coat of lime is spread, slaked, and rightly beaten
      until the surface is as smooth as a table, and it shines like
      glass."<br>
      <br>
      Descriptions follow of yet more stages of laborious hammering of
      the ground, and wetting it, then coating it with further layers of
      lime, straw and earth. The cost of this Herculean labour was a
      meagre &amp;pound;40, the wages of three men included. There are
      ponds in good condition now which were made 36 years ago, and
      which have never been known to fail to yield an adequate supply of
      water even in this year of drought, concluded the Gazette's
      correspondent. <br>
      <br>
      One man who is currently on a quest to resolve the abiding mystery
      of dew ponds is Martin Snow, an IT consultant based in Worthing.
      In his spare time, he marches around the hills from East Sussex to
      Beachy Head as part of a university study, and the very first task
      he set himself was to locate remaining dew ponds.<br>
      <br>
      &amp;#039;It is becoming like a treasure hunt,&amp;#039; says an
      eager Mr Snow. &amp;#039;Occasionally you get a hint of a pond,
      then go back to the maps, and find, on different editions, that
      they appear or disappear.&amp;#039; By his calculation, there are
      as many as 100 to 200 in West Sussex alone, some of which may have
      begun as watering holes dug by Neolithic man for his livestock. <br>
      <br>
      He goes on to point out that dew ponds were strategically
      positioned to make the most of mist and of rainclouds billowing up
      from the nearby coast to the chilly heights of the downs, where
      any water that collects is less likely to evaporate. "Effectively
      you are often in the cloud up here, and, if it is chilled enough,
      it will condense. Some people say an overhanging tree will help a
      pond a lot and I can believe that because, if you go out walking
      when the mist on the downs is extremely thick, you will find trees
      dripping with moisture."; <br>
      <br>
      So it seems that dew ponds are indeed fed by dew and are truly
      droughtproof. &amp;#039;It seems magical, but when you start
      looking at the numbers, it starts to make sense. Dew ponds
      work,&amp;#039; he concludes. <br>

      damp straw spread over the puddled clay would prevent its drying
      and cracking before the pond filled. It might also act as binding.
      The straw would rot eventually, but once the pond filled this
      would not matter. Some ponds have a bottom layer of chalk or lime,
      about 50mm (2") thick, which may serve to keep earth-worms from
      penetratinDesign&lt;/h3&gt; Dew ponds occur mainly on porous soils
      where the rainfall is about 1m (40") per year, and the annual
      evaporation from a body of open water is in the range of 450mm
      (18"). The traditional dew pond design ensures an adequate water
      supply from rainwater alone, by maximising the pond's catchment
      area in relation to its evaporation area. The average dew pond is
      about 18m (20 yards) across its water surface with a further
      collection margin of at least 3.6m (4 yards).<br>
      <br>
      A typical dew pond contains over 273,000 litres (60,000 gallons)
      of water, and even under conditions of drought, should last three
      months before going dry. However, if stock are watered at the
      pond, the rate of water loss will greatly increase. The dew pond
      has a built up rim, which acts as a water catchment area. The
      cross section shows how the evaporation area shrinks as the water
      level drops. The vertical scale is exaggerated in the diagram. The
      maximum depth can vary from 1.2-2.4m (4-8').<br>
      <br>
      The various layers indicated are those of the 'average' dew pond,
      although Pugsley (1939), found that there were many variations.
      Straw is sometimes claimed to be a 'non-conducting' material
      critical to the pond's performance, but there is no consistency in
      its use and many successful ponds have no straw. It is likely,
      howeveg the puddled clay. Some have a thick top layer of rubble,
      broken chalk or stone which helps protect the impervious layer
      from animals' hooves. Some ponds are made of concrete, and one has
      a layer of gas tar, showing the influence of more modern
      technology on an ancient craft.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Siting</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In times past, the siting as well as construction of dew ponds was
      something of a mystery, a closely kept secret among professional
      pond-makers, who combined water-dousing with pond-making. However,
      most so-called dew ponds are in fact aided by surface drainage,
      and locating the pond in a shallow depression will increase the
      catchment. Too much runoff is not desirable, as the pond will
      rapidly silt up. Ponds receiving runoff from cultivated land will
      silt up much more quickly than ponds in permanent pasture.<br>
      <br>
      It may be possible to take advantage of runoff from minor roads
      and tracks, although this may also cause silting as well as
      problems from pollutants such as oil residues. Site dew ponds well
      away from trees, as their roots may damage the pond lining.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Question Date :3rd January 2003</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        Question:</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        Are the dew ponds on the Wiltshire downs fed by dew and how old
        are they?</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        Answer:<br>
        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Dew ponds are
      actually fed by rainwater and they are normally situated in a
      slight depression so that there is a reasonable sized catchment
      area for rain. The amount of dew falling in a year is around half
      an inch whereas the rainfall will be between 30 and 40 inches a
      year. The water retention properties of the dew ponds lay in their
      making and the appreciation of the margins of the pond as a
      catchment area. The bottom layer of the pond was puddled chalk or
      clay, which was normally covered by straw, laid as it would have
      been on a thatched roof. This was then covered by a mixture of
      loose materials such as chalk rubble, sand, flints or gravel.<br>
      <br>
      Most existing dew ponds date from the 19th or early 20th
      centuries, although a few may be 18th century. The only apparent
      ancient one is Oxenmere on Milk Hill on the downs to the north of
      the Vale of Pewsey. A Saxon charter of 825 refers to this pond as
      marking the boundary of Alton Priors, which it still does. It is
      possible that a pond has been here since that date but only if it
      has been cleaned out and its lining renewed every 100 to 200 years
      for Ralph Whitlock estimated that the life of a dew pond is 100 to
      150 years.<br>
      <br>
      The ponds were about eight feet deep and would often be fenced,
      with a small gap that nothing bigger than a sheep could get
      through. This saved the bottom of the pond being damaged by
      cattle. Dew pond makers tended to tour the country between
      September and April making up to 15 ponds, depending on their
      size. It would take four men about four weeks to construct a fair
      sized pond. Well known dew pond makers at the end of the 19th
      century were Charles White, Joel Cruse, Jabez Earley and Daniel
      Pearce of Imber. The decline of sheep on Salisbury Plain and the
      downs lessened the need for these ponds and it is believed that
      the last one in Wiltshire was made by the Smith family of West
      Lavington in 1938.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">What is a Dew Pond ?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The subject of the dew
      pond is one of perennial interest, and questions as to how it
      works and where it is to be found, and what is its secret, are
      frequently asked. <br>
      <br>
      The ponds to which the name has been applied are found as a rule
      on high chalk country, and hence they have been closely connected
      with the chalk downs which extend from Beachy Head to the west of
      Sussex. <br>
      <br>
      People have noticed that they rarely run dry, even in the hottest
      summer, and it is apparent that they receive during the night a
      supply of water sufficient to counter-balance the great draughts
      that are made upon them by cattle and evaporation during the day.<br>
      <br>
      It has been assumed, therefore, that the dew which falls so
      heavily on the grass of the downs during the hot summers and
      autumns also falls into the ponds, and thus makes up for any loss
      during the' day-time, whether by cattle or by evaporation. <br>
      <br>
      That this is pure assumption has, I think, been satisfactorily
      shown, but the idea is a fascinating one, and the mysterious
      filling of the dew pond will no doubt for a long time still
      exercise the minds of the curious.<br>
      <br>
      Owing to the bringing of water by pipes and bore-holes to many
      lonely downland farms, it is sad to notice that many of the ponds
      have been allowed for want of a little attention to leak their
      contents away. <br>
      <br>
      When once they are made they require so little attention, and they
      seem to be so perennial, that successive farmers neglect them. The
      growth of water-weeds and rushes is rapid, and unless these are
      cleared away from time to time the ponds are bound to leak. <br>
      <br>
      The roots of such vegetation find their way through the
      foundations and provide many channels for the water to pass
      through. They may, too, be repaired carelessly. One fine pond on
      the Sussex Downs that I knew was not only cleared of its weed, but
      all the valuable chalky puddle, which formed its waterproof bed,
      was cleared away also. The result has been that it will no longer
      hold water. Neglect and carelessness has been the ruin of most of
      the Sussex dew ponds, and really fine ones are now few and far
      between.<br>
      <br>
      I have used and still use the term &amp;quot; dew pond &amp;quot;
      for these upland ponds, but it may be startling to some to be told
      that there is no such thing as a dew pond. You may ask a farmer
      where he gets his water from, and he will answer you from the dew.
      If you ask him what becomes of the rain, or the mists that roll
      over the downs, he will say, well, that is just the same as dew ;
      everything that comes out of the air is the same as dew. As a
      matter of fact, the name &amp;quot; dew pond &amp;quot; was not
      known much more than a century ago. They were known as &amp;quot;
      mist ponds.&amp;quot; This name has been met with in Surrey, Kent,
      and Wiltshire, and at Worms Heath, and the name of "fog pond" or
      "cloud pond" was at one time well known at Hampstead.<br>
      <br>
      Gilbert White noticed the phenomenon of high-lying ponds and wrote
      about them in 1776.<br>
      <br>
      Miall wrote, &amp;quot; It is plain that the water in such ponds
      is not drawn from springs, nor from surface drainage, nor wholly
      from rain.<br>
      <br>
      Being a native of the south-down country I have always been
      interested in these ponds, although for some years my interest did
      not extend beyond the newts and the pond-snails that they
      contained. But some time ago I was awarded a grant by the Royal
      Society to make actual observation and experiments into the
      working of dew ponds. I occupied a disused windmill on Clayton
      Down, so as to be on the spot day and night, and so catch the dew
      in the act, so to speak, if perchance it had anything to do with
      the filling of ponds. My experiments extended over a period of
      three years, during which I observed the habits of a good many
      ponds in the central area of the South Downs between the coast and
      the Weald.<br>
      <br>
      Dew in the strict meaning of the word can never feed a pond. It is
      formed from the moisture in the air being in contact with the
      cooled earth when this has radiated its heat after nightfall.
      Formation of dew on grass is, of course, a very common phenomenon.
      But in three months' observations on a pond there were but five
      occasions when the water was found to be below dew-point. Four of
      these were between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m., and the rising heat of the
      sun would have soon done away with this state of affairs. But even
      where most likely to be formed, it has been estimated that the
      annual dew-fall does not exceed 1.5 inches. <br>
      <br>
      Night after night I have watched for the semblance of dew being
      formed on the banks of a pond, but without success. The grass on
      the down may be wringing wet with dew, but it was impossible for
      this to trickle down into the pond. A few grasses with shallow
      roots growing in a pond might cause the formation of some dew, but
      in the best -kept dew ponds the grasses are not allowed to grow.
      Only on one occasion out of many hundreds of observations did
      there appear in one pond to be a slight increase of water during a
      clear night when no rain fell. I was forced to conclude that the
      name &amp;quot;dew pond&amp;quot; was a misnomer, and nothing has
      appeared since the period of my observations to shake the
      stability of my conclusions.<br>
      <br>
      All my observations, went to show, as was to be expected, that the
      temperature of water of a pond rarely went down below dew-point
      during the night. In hot summer weather, when with the
      accumulation of heat the temperature of the water gradually rose
      in the day-time, there was insufficient time during the short
      summer nights for radiation to proceed to such a degree that its
      temperature went down below dew-point. The specific heat of water
      is, of course, very great, and its changes of temperature are very
      gradual, whereas changes on the grass, on the dry bank of a pond,
      and in the atmosphere, are more rapid.<br>
      <br>
      These changes are shown in the diagram, from which it will be seen
      that in a short summer night the temperature on the grass went
      down to 54° F., whilst that of the water, although sympathetically
      following the former, went down only to 66° F. If dew can ever be
      deposited on the water a much longer period of radiation is
      necessary than can as a rule be found in a summer night. Of course
      the water appears to be cool to the hand, but that is only because
      the hand is of a much greater temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The construction of the bottom of a pond must be such as to ensure
      that it be watertight. In Sussex, finely-powdered chalk is almost
      invariably used, and this is worked into a puddle, giving a whitey
      colour to the water when disturbed by cattle. Clay is used in some
      parts, and this is of course more easily worked into a puddled
      condition. In western Sussex clay is found here and there in
      pockets on the Downs, and where this is the case it is brought
      into requisition. But if it has to be brought up from the gault
      clay below the hills, the cost of making a pond is considerably
      augmented, and chalk puddle is used. In the remaking of the
      Chanctonbury ponds a few years ago sufficient clay was found near
      at hand for the purpose. The whole secret of getting the bottom to
      be waterproof lies in the finely-divided condition to which the
      chalk or clay is reduced. This is frequently done by driving a
      team of horses and a broad-wheeled cart round and round the pond
      for an hour or more each day, so as to reduce to powder any lumps
      that remain. An old labourer told me that when he was a boy he was
      employed for this purpose. After the broad-wheeled cart had done
      its work, the puddle was flattened out with a spade, until it was
      quite smooth. The margin as treated in the same way, and thus
      nearly all the rain that fell ran down into the pond. When the
      bottom is made of clay it is the practice to mix the puddle with a
      certain amount of lime, and this prevents the working of worms.
      These creatures can be very destructive to the waterproof bottom
      of a pond.<br>
      <br>
      Although straw is never used, so far as could be ascertained, in
      making ponds in Sussex, it is used considerably in Wiltshire and
      Yorkshire. But there is a considerable division of opinion as to
      why it is used. One on Thorpe Downs, near Lough-borough, was
      stated by Mr. Slade to be laid down as follows: First, about 12
      inches of clay, mixed with some lime, then a layer of straw, to
      prevent the sun cracking the clay, and then a layer of loose
      rubble.<br>
      <br>
      During 400 years it only leaked in one year, and this was caused
      by the roots of rushes which penetrated the clay. In Yorkshire,
      Mr. Mortimer said that there were very many ponds in the Midwolds.
      In constructing them, straw is placed on the impervious bed of
      beaten clay, to prevent the broken chalk, which is strewed on the
      clay, from being trodden into the clay. On the Wiltshire Downs,
      straw is cut into short lengths and mixed with the clay to prevent
      it cracking and letting the water through. But some of the ponds
      there are of more complicated construction, consisting of three
      layers of clay alternating with three layers of straw. The straw
      would prevent a good deal of slipping and cracking of the clay,
      but it would, of course, be thoroughly compressed by the weight of
      the clay, and would also be in so thoroughly a water-logged
      condition that it would be useless as an encouragement to
      precipitation, and its non-conducting power would be lost.<br>
      <br>
      Diagrammatically, the basis of some of the ponds that have come
      under notice are shown here, and it will be seen that there is
      considerable variety in <br>
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      Gilbert White noticed the contrast between those ponds which were
      situated at an elevation above the surrounding country and those
      which were situated at the lower levels. Many of the latter are,
      of course, fed by brooks, and when these dry up in the course of a
      hot summer the ponds also suffer. No one questions the source of
      their water. It is quite apparent. But it only occurs to an
      observant mind to ask the question why water is still found in the
      higher ponds when the lower ones are dried up. If the rainfall
      were spread equally over all months of the year then ponds would
      never run dry. But it is not so, and those months which are most
      liable to drought are just those months when the higher ponds
      furnish a supply of water in spite of the drought below. Further,
      there is evaporation from the surface of a pond to consider. This
      is very considerable, and it is, of course, only the difference
      between the two that will be of service in feeding a pond. During
      four years (1909 to 1912 inclusive) I found the average rainfall
      to be 43-61 inches on Clayton Down, considerably more than had
      been anticipated. The most reliable experiments of evaporation
      that I have been able to find, extending over thirty years, gave,
      at Croydon, an average of 18-14 inches. The difference between the
      two, namely, 25-47 inches, would be the amount of rain that would
      go to feed the pond, supposing that the surface-area of the pond
      was the only collecting ground. But the area of the banks around
      the pond form a collecting area at least as much again as the
      pond-surface, and sometimes twice or more than that area, so that
      the total of rain feeding the pond must be multiplied accordingly.
      But it must also be remembered that a good deal of rain falling on
      the bank percolates into the soil. Some banks are of loose
      material and others are found to have been rammed hard. With the
      best of ponds perhaps not ,more than a half of the rainfall flows
      down into the pond.<br>
      <br>
      Thus we have a total as follows, when the banks are twice the area
      of the pond. <br>
      <br>
      On the pond surface 25-47 inches, on the banks half of twice 43-61
      inches, or a total of 69-08 inches. A wide bank twice the area of
      the pond is quite a common occurrence. Unfortunately there is
      least rainfall in the months when there is the greatest
      evaporation. Nine-tenths of the total evaporation occurs in the
      six summer months, and only about a third of the rainfall, so that
      in order to account for the filling of the ponds we must look to
      some other recruit. This is to be found in mists and fogs.<br>
      <br>
      No one can be on the watch on the Downs for many weeks together
      without being struck by the frequency and density of the mists.
      Rolling up from the coast they fill up all hollows, before
      apparently jumping off at the escarpment facing the Weald.
      Sometimes when they disappear masses are still seen filling up the
      hollows of the ponds. During my experiments I distinctly found
      occasions when there was a slight rise in the surface of a pond,
      when rain was but a slight factor. These were always cloudy or
      foggy nights or days, or so windy that the deposition of dew was
      out of the question. One has but to walk on the downs in a thick
      mist to experience the quantity of water that they give out. Not
      only is the grass wetter than even after the heaviest dew, but
      one's clothing becomes reeking with moisture. Bushes can be heard
      dripping their loads on to the grass or fallen leaves beneath. If
      such bushes are' on the edge of a pond their moisture will in part
      trickle down into it. It has, therefore, been advocated that if
      possible trees or bushes should be planted at the edge of, or
      overhanging, the pond. Such would undoubtedly add to the water in
      it, but this would not be dew. And the difficulty would remain of
      getting trees or bushes to grow in such exposed positions. But it
      must be confessed that all the best ponds have no trees or bushes
      on or near them. By a gradual process of elimination I was forced
      to the conclusion that there was no source of moisture but mist or
      low clouds to account for the fact that well-made ponds do not dry
      up in the summer.<br>
      <br>
      Real dew, that is, dew formed out of the low-lying layer resting
      immediately upon the soil, is almost pure water. It occurred to me
      to ascertain how the water from ponds compared with pure water. To
      do so I obtained specimens of water from eighteen ponds, and these
      were analysed. The quantity of chlorine found in them was
      noticeable, and this was probably brought in by winds from the
      sea, or by mists blown in from the same source. One specimen was
      obtained soon after a pond had dried up, -but had been partly
      filled again by rain. It contained the lowest proportion of
      chlorine of the whole series. But the mists that blew in from the
      sea were probably condensed around finely-divided salt nuclei, and
      when these fell into pond-areas they would gradually increase the
      salinity of the water, owing to the process of evaporation which
      is always going on. Thus those ponds that had been in existence
      for the longest time would have the most chlorine, and this was
      fully borne out by the analyses of three pond-waters which have
      never&amp;nbsp; been known to fail. As a contrast, the water of a
      pond was analysed into which there fell a good deal of animal
      pollution. It was a clay-puddled pond. The amount of chlorine
      therein found was com-parable to that contained in sewage, and
      this was but to be expected. The total hardness of all chalk
      -puddled ponds was naturally great. When soils from the Downs have
      been analysed these have always been found to contain chloride of
      sodium, and this is gradually washed downwards into the sub-soil.
      But in carefully-prepared ponds this remains, and accumulates, and
      hence their increasing salinity as time goes on. As the salt-laden
      mists roll up from the sea their particles are, as I hold,
      deposited by gravity wherever arrested by a depression. As the
      clouds which give rise to rain are formed in the same manner,
      these must contain a good deal of salt also, and when it rains
      this will also fall. But in the summer months it is the deficiency
      of rain that has given rise to the phenomena ofdew-ponds ; hence I
      think we must look entirely to mists for the explanation of a
      constant supply of water when there is a deficiency of rain. Most
      authorities have observed that when a pond is first dug out it is
      advisable to give it some artificial assistance, and this is done
      by pouring water over the puddle or by heaping snow around it when
      that is possible. A water surface thus appears to favour the
      further deposition of water out of the mists. My own observations
      did not go to show that after misty nights there occurred any of
      those great rises in the surfaces of ponds which have been from
      time to time recorded, and I am of opinion that these increases
      have been exaggerated, but herein lies ground for further
      experimental work.<br>
      <br>
      Details of experiments which I carried out on the South Downs,
      together with thermometric tables of many observations which I
      made, will be found in &amp;quot;The Geographical
      journal,&amp;quot; for August, 1909, and October, 1910, and can
      there be referred to, if desired.<br>
      <br>
      As regards the age of the ponds. As the earliest men in our
      country probably dwelt on the Downs they must have in some way
      provided themselves with a water supply. They must have made ponds
      for this purpose, having noticed that when chalk had been
      well-trampled out by cattle it became watertight. Such ponds may
      thus have been made by Early Man, but it requires a keen
      imagination to say that the existing ponds date from the time of
      neolithic man. As man took to the lower lying country he probably
      neglected his upland ponds. Many new ones may have been brought
      into use when the downs once more came to be used as sheep-walks,
      during the wool-growing times of the mediaeval sheep-masters, and
      it is possible that some of the present-day ponds date from the
      times of the immigrant Fleming. This, however, is purely
      conjectural.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Full Text </span>: A valuable
      article by the Rev.&nbsp; Edgar Glanfield, Vicar of Imber,
      appeared in the Wiltshire Gazette, Dec. 29th, 1922, in which he
      sets down information as to the method of making these ponds,
      gained directly from living parishioners of Imber, who in past
      years carried on a regular and hereditary business of dew pond
      making&nbsp; -Charles Wise, aged 81, Joel Cruse, aged 79, both
      master dew pond makers, and Jabez Earley and Daniel Pearce, both
      nearly 80 years old, their assistants.&nbsp; A great deal has been
      written on the subject of the way in which dew ponds gain their
      water supply, but it is generally believed now that they are
      chiefly dependent on rain. Mr Glanfield however, is concerned only
      with their formation.<br>
      <br>
      “Up to ten years ago the dew pond makers started upon their work
      about the 12th of September, and they toured the country for a
      period of six or seven months, making in sequence from six to
      fifteen ponds, according to size and conveniences, in a season of
      winter and spring..... They travelled throughout Wiltshire and
      Hampshire, and occasionally into Somersetshire arid Berkshire, and
      even into Kent.” The dew pond maker with three assistants at 18s.
      a week, would require about four weeks to make a pond 22 yards, or
      one chain, square.&nbsp; Providing all his own tools and
      appliances he would charge about £40 for the work. “ The work
      commenced by the removal of the soil to the depth of eight
      feet.&nbsp; The laying of the floor is then proceeded with from
      the centre, called the crown, four or five yards in circumference,
      and to this each day a width of about two yards is added, and
      continued, course by course until the sides of the basin attain to
      the normal level of the site.&nbsp; Only so much work with the
      layers of materials set in order, is undertaken in one day as can
      be finished at night, and this must be covered over with straw and
      steined.&nbsp; No layering may be done in frosty or inclement
      weather.&nbsp; And this is the method of construction:- seventy
      cart loads of clay are scattered over the area, suggested
      above.&nbsp; The clay is thoroughly puddled, trodden and beaten in
      flat with beaters, a coat of lime is spread, slaked, and rightly
      beaten until the surface is as smooth as a table, and it shines
      like glass.&nbsp; After it has been hammered in twice, a second
      coat of lime is applied, to the thickness of half-an-inch, which
      is wetted and faced to save the under face.&nbsp; A waggon load of
      straw is arranged and the final surface is covered with rough
      earth to the thickness of nine inches.&nbsp; The pond when
      finished affords a depth of water of seven feet." It is then
      fenced round to keep off cattle and horses, whose hoofs, would
      break through the bed, and admit sheep only, for whose use the
      ponds are made.&nbsp; The durability of the dew pond is put at
      “perhaps 20 years, though “there are ponds in good condition now
      which were made 36 years ago, and which have never been known to
      fail to yield an adequate supply of water even in this year of
      drought (1921).&nbsp; The decay of the industry is attributed
      partly to the greatly increased cost of the making of the ponds,
      and partly to the fact that they have been superseded by the
      windmill pumping water from wells.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Edward Coward, of Devizes, had an excellent letter in the
      Spectator, January 14th, 1922, p. 47, on the method of making Dew
      Ponds in Wiltshire.&nbsp; He says “the site is first excavated,
      and the soil taken out thrown up as a bank so as to lengthen the
      shore of the pond.&nbsp; A start is made from the centre.&nbsp; A
      layer of clay about three inches thick when loose, is strenuously
      and methodically rammed.&nbsp; Then lime is spread, and it is
      rammed again.&nbsp; Two more layers of clay and lime are treated
      in the same way.&nbsp; The work is built up from the centre, not
      sectionally up the sides.&nbsp; Each day's work is carefully
      covered with straw; this, for the moment, is to prevent the puddle
      from drying and cracking. When the whole area is treated it is
      covered with a layer of straw more than a foot thick.&nbsp; This
      in turn is covered with nine&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inches of chalk
      rubble.&nbsp; The object of the straw is to protect the puddle
      from indentations which might be made by the rubble until it is
      properly set.&nbsp; A pond made in this way, thirty feet square at
      the edge of the puddle area, took seventy small cartloads of clay
      and about twelve tons of lime. I have heard, of course, of the
      straw being put under the clay, and am aware of the insulating
      theory involved.&nbsp; I cannot conceive, however, how a puddle
      could be made good on the top of a springy substance like
      straw.&nbsp; Firm ground to ram upon is the very essence of this
      method of construction.” He regards rain as the most important
      factor in the filling of the ponds.&nbsp; “In my opinion the whole
      surface of the hollow in a pond which is used daily by sheep
      becomes puddled by the action of their hoofs, and with the
      exception of the first rainfall after a drought, practically the
      whole of the rain which falls finds its way to the water.<br>

      <br>
      Clay puddling, I am glad to report, is an art in pond construction
      that went out with handlebar mustaches and high-wheeled bicycles.
      It never was much of an art, in my opinion, but I don't think any
      discussion of pond building would be complete without some mention
      of it, for it was one of the pioneer techniques of water
      gardening.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Puddling with Clay</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The builder of a clay-puddled pond first made a concave
      excavation, sloping the sides carefully at an angle of not more
      than 40 to 45 degrees. He then lined the concavity with a 6- to
      8-inch layer of the coarsest straw he could find. On top of the
      straw he put a 6-inch layer of clay, which he moistened and tamped
      down into the straw as tightly as possible.<br>
      <br>
      All the clay-puddled ponds I have seen required a constant trickle
      of water into them to make up for that lost by seepage. Spring or
      stream water, always 15 to 20 degrees colder than still water
      warmed by the sun, maintained a pond temperature too cold for good
      (frequently too cold for any) water-lily growth. A trickle piped
      into the pond from a household water system would be even colder,
      and expensive to boot.<br>
      <br>
      The clay linings of these ponds attracted crawfish as spilled
      molasses attracts flies. After a couple of them had burrowed
      through the pond's lining, many a pond enthusiast in the old days
      discovered that overnight his beautiful water garden had become
      just a mud hole, so to remain until he patched the holes and
      refilled the pond.<br>
      <br>
      Clay-puddled ponds are now blessedly of the past, and good
      riddance. Any structure that will enable a couple of crawfish to
      ruin a man's whole summer just isn't practical enough to bother
      building.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DEW PONDS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Natural dew ponds, also known as cloud ponds and mist ponds, are
      near-miraculous works of nature. They just happen, sometimes, in
      shady places that remain constantly damp, even in hot, dry
      weather. The mystery of them is their principal fascination. They
      have no apparent source of water, and yet they thrive, their cold,
      clear waters never seeming to diminish. <br>
      <br>
      A few English water gardeners with plenty of time and even more
      patience have been able to construct them and make them work. An
      artificial dew pond is built, much as a puddled-clay pond,
      although on a much smaller scale. The layer of straw that goes
      into the excavation is much thicker, perhaps a foot or more of it.
      The clay lining is tamped in upon the straw in the conventional
      way.<br>
      <br>
      Nature does the rest, sometimes with a little help in the
      beginning. In time, the pond fills with rain water. The nest of
      straw serves as insulation, so that the clay shell and the water
      in it remain somewhat cooler at all times than the surrounding
      air. Dew condenses nightly on the cool clay banks, runs down into
      the little pond, and replaces moisture lost by seepage and
      evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      An amateur should not attempt to build a dew pond, because few of
      them work out. As only the very hardiest of aquatic growths can be
      coaxed to live in one, even if it does turn out satisfactorily,
      the water gardener receives little reward for his labors.<br>

        Area</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Brighton and Hove City Council own most if not all the farmland
      withinand adjacent to their borders.<br>
      <br>
      Much is on lease to tenant farmers, who have to pay a rent to the
      finance department, it might be thought that this arrangement
      could be at variance to any desire for conservation that the
      ratepayers may have.<br>
      <br>
      All the council owned farmland is administered by the Estates
      Section of the Performance and Resources Department of the City
      Council. I was pleased to note that there is a Countryside
      Service, which has been involved in a number of restorations of
      Dewponds,&amp;nbsp; which lie on land owned by the city, though
      not necessarily within it's administrative borders. They are also
      responsible, among other duties, for the ongoing management of the
      ponds for wildlife and amenity.<br>
      <br>
      I am pleased to feature this contribution from one of their
      rangers :-<br>
      <br>
      From David Larkin (Countryside Ranger)<br>
      <br>
      Having worked on the restoration of several dew ponds for Brighton
      &amp;amp; Hove Council.<br>
      <br>
      The modern method is:<br>
      <br>
      Re-profile the site (silt builds up in the centre more than the
      edges) Remove large flints (to prevent liner being damaged )<br>
      <br>
      Spread Teram over the area ( a tough protective "cloth")<br>
      <br>
      Spread liner, we were using butyl but are now using heavy gauge,
      virtually tear proof 0.5mm PVC (which can be welded into 20x40m
      strips in the factory) as it is a lot cheaper<br>
      <br>
      Spread another layer of Terram<br>
      <br>
      Spread a layer of clay about 1ft thick<br>
      <br>
      A liner is necessary in most ponds now as we no longer have the
      patter of sheep's feet to re-puddle the clay as the pond refills
      over the winter.<br>
      <br>
      Straw was used to protect the liner and should not rot too quickly
      in anaerobic conditions but Terram is stronger and should not rot
      at all. The clay can be quite a problem, quarry bottoms are
      cheapest, but the wrong sort of clay slumps and exposes the liner.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately this method is not very successful where there are
      cows present as they puncture the liner.<br>
      <br>
      I have seen an example of a stone pitched pond in the Chilterns (I
      think) but would be interested in any ideas on how to construct a
      cow proof dew pond.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Excavation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Prior to restoration I have had some trial excavations done, there
      was no evidence of any clay in the pond Bevendean. I assume this
      was puddled chalk of which there are references in the literature
      (the base for new coast road at Black Rock was created by spraying
      and rolling the chalk).<br>
      <br>
      The pond on Hollingbury Hill shown on the 1970 map was originally
      built of local clay, then concreted over, before being backfilled
      with the remains of an adjacent barn to make a green for the golf
      course in the 1930's. This subsequently went out of use and the
      whole area was densely scrubbed over prior to restoration.<br>
      <br>
      Hopefully the drawings from this excavation will get published
      eventually.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Puddling</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I seem to recall Oxen were used for puddling, pulling a wide
      wheeled cart full of stones around, this would have been during
      relatively dry weather, possibly laying a layer, wetting it,
      puddling it, then laying another layer, etc, I think this is how
      the chalk ponds were done. Quite different from having them in the
      pond all year.<br>
      <br>
      I remember reading of experiments with mica at the turn of the
      century into the heat effects around dew ponds, I think they were
      inconclusive as vandals ended the experiment prematurely,<br>
      <br>
      From memory Brighton Council/Brighton &amp; Hove Council have
      restored the following dew ponds<br>
      <br>
      Ditchling Beacon (following clearance of munitions by army)<br>
      Lotts Pond, Stanmer Woods (concrete, 1980's MSC team)<br>
      Housdean Farm<br>
      Bevendean Down<br>
      Varncoombe Hill, Waterhall Farm<br>
      Sweet Hill, Waterhall Farm<br>
      Piddingworth, Stanmer Park<br>
      Rock Pond, Standean Farm<br>
      Tanners Pond, Standean Farm<br>
      Falmer Hill, Falmer Court Farm (Removal of silt)<br>
      and created dew ponds at Waterhall East Brighton Golf Course<br>
