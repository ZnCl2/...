      The next big thing in solar energy could be microscopic.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists at MIT and Harvard University have devised a way to
      store solar energy in molecules that can then be tapped to heat
      homes, water or used for cooking.<br>
      <br>
      The best part: The molecules can store the heat forever and be
      endlessly re-used while emitting absolutely no greenhouse
      gases.&nbsp; Scientists remain a way’s off in building this
      perpetual heat machine but they have succeeded in the laboratory
      at demonstrating the viability of the phenomenon called
      photoswitching.<br>
      <br>
      “Some molecules, known as photoswitches, can assume either of two
      different shapes, as if they had a hinge in the middle,” MIT
      researchers said in statement about the paper published in the
      journal Nature Chemistry. “Exposing them to sunlight causes them
      to absorb energy and jump from one configuration to the other,
      which is then stable for long periods of time.”<br>
      <br>
      To liberate that energy all you have to do is expose the molecules
      to a small amount of light, heat or electricity and when they
      switch back to the other shape the emit heat. “In effect, they
      behave as rechargeable thermal batteries: taking in energy from
      the sun, storing it indefinitely, and then releasing it on
      demand,” the scientists said.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers used a photoswitching substance called an
      azobenzene, attaching the molecules to substrates of carbon
      nanotubes. The challenge: Packing the molecules closely enough
      together to achieve a sufficient energy density to generate usable
      heat.<br>
      <br>
      It appeared that the researchers had failed when they were only
      able to pack fewer than half the number of molecules needed as
      indicated by an earlier computer simulation of the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      But instead of hitting a projected 30 percent increase in energy
      density, they saw a 200 percent increase. It turned out that the
      key was not so much packing azobenzene molecules tightly on
      individual carbon nanotubes as packing the nanotubes close
      together. That’s because the azobenzene molecules formed “teeth”
      on the carbon nanotubes, which interlocked with teeth on adjacent
      nanotubes. The result was the mass needed for a usable amount of
      energy storage.<br>
      <br>
      That means different combinations of photoswitching molecules and
      substrates might achieve the same or greater energy storage,
      according to the researchers.<br>
      <br>
      So how would molecular solar storage work if the technology can be
      commercialized? Timothy Kucharski, the paper’s lead author and a
      postdoc at MIT and Harvard, told The Atlantic that most likely the
      storage would take a liquid form, which would be easy to
      transport.<br>
      <br>
      “It would also enable charging by flowing the material from a
      storage tank through a window or clear tube exposed to the sun and
      then to another storage tank, where the material would remain
      until it's needed,” Kucharski said in an email.&nbsp; “That way
      one could stockpile the charged material for use when the sun's
      not shining.”<br>
      <br>
      The paper’s authors envision the technology could be used in
      countries where most people rely on burning wood or dung for
      cooking, which creates dangerous levels of indoor air pollution,
      leads to deforestation and contributes to climate change.<br>
      <br>
      “For solar cooking, one would leave the device out in the sun
      during the day,” says Kucharski. “One design we have for such an
      application is purely gravity driven – the material flows from one
      tank to another. The flow rate is restricted so that it's exposed
      to the sun long enough that it gets fully charged. Then, when it's
      time to cook dinner, after the sun is down, the flow direction is
      reversed, again driven by gravity, and the opposite side of the
      setup is used as the cooking surface.”<br>
      <br>
      “As the material flows back to the first tank, it passes by an
      immobilized catalyst which triggers the energy-releasing process,
      heating the cooking surface up,” he adds.<br>
      <br>
      Other versions of such device could be used to heat buildings.<br>
      <br>
      Kucharski said the MIT and Harvard team is now investigating other
      photoswitching molecules and substrates, “with the aim of
      designing a system that absorbs more of the sun's energy and also
      can be more practically scaled up.”<br>

      Large-scale utilization of solar-energy resources will require
      considerable advances in energy-storage technologies to meet
      ever-increasing global energy demands. Other than liquid fuels,
      existing energy-storage materials do not provide the requisite
      combination of high energy density, high stability, easy handling,
      transportability and low cost. New hybrid solar thermal fuels,
      composed of photoswitchable molecules on rigid, low-mass
      nanostructures, transcend the physical limitations of molecular
      solar thermal fuels by introducing local sterically constrained
      environments in which interactions between chromophores can be
      tuned. We demonstrate this principle of a hybrid solar thermal
      fuel using azobenzene-functionalized carbon nanotubes. We show
      that, on composite bundling, the amount of energy stored per
      azobenzene more than doubles from 58 to 120 kJ mol–1, and the
      material also maintains robust cyclability and stability. Our
      results demonstrate that solar thermal fuels composed of
      molecule–nanostructure hybrids can exhibit significantly enhanced
      energy-storage capabilities through the generation of
      template-enforced steric strain.<br>

      A solar thermal fuel can include a plurality of photoswitchable
      moieties associated with a nanomaterial. The plurality of
      photoswitchable moieties can be densely arranged on the
      nanomaterial, such that adjacent photoswitchable moieties interact
      with one another. The solar thermal fuel can provide high
      volumetric energy density.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This invention relates to nano-templated energy storage
      materials, particularly solar thermal fuels, and methods of making
      and using them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The development of new energy technologies that are
      simultaneously economically viable, clean, sustainable, and easily
      transportable has become one of the most important research goals
      of the 21st century. Full utilization of the largest and most
      obvious source of renewable energy-the sun-requires advanced
      technologies for converting light into other useful forms of
      energy, as well as novel means for storing energy for convenient
      transport and on-demand use. One promising concept that has
      recently become the focus of renewed attention is that of solar
      thermal fuels, which store energy from the sun in photoactive
      molecules. Upon absorption of light energy, a photoactive molecule
      adopts a higher-energy metastable state. To release the energy
      stored in the higher-energy state, an external trigger (such as
      heat, light, voltage, or a chemical reaction) is applied). The
      fuel can subsequently be recharged by exposure to light; in
      principle, the entire operation can be repeated ad infinitum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Solar thermal fuels provide advantages including
      renewability, absence of emissions, and is easy transportation in
      the form of a liquid or powder. Solar thermal fuels based on a
      photoswitchable moiety associated with a nanomaterial template can
      offer certain advantages over fuels based on non-templated
      photoswitchable materials. The nanomaterial template can provide
      ordered and closely spaced sites for photoswitchable moieties to
      anchor, so that a large number of photoswitchable moieties can be
      provided in a small volume, resulting in increased energy density.
      Solar thermal fuels based on diazobenzene photoswitchable moieties
      and carbon nanotubes can have volumetric energy densities
      comparable to or greater than those of state of the art Li-ion
      batteries.<br>

        eV per azobenzene. A thermal barrier, Ea, prevents the back
        reaction from occurring under storage conditions; an external
        trigger controls the release of the stored energy. The inset

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0046] In general, a solar thermal fuel stores light energy in the
      form of chemical bonds and subsequently releases that energy for
      practical work. This process is illustrated schematically in FIGS.
      1a and 1b: upon absorption of light with energy hv, a photoactive
      "fuel" molecule undergoes a conformational change or reaction to a
      higher energy metastable state, thus storing energy [Delta]H. An
      external trigger (e.g., heat, light, voltage, or a chemical
      reaction) is applied, providing energy to overcome the thermal
      barrier, Ea, and releasing a net energy of [Delta]H per molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] A solar thermal fuel can include photoswitchable moieties
      combined with a nanomaterial. The nanomaterial can provide a
      scaffold to arrange the photoswitchable moieties; in some cases,
      the arrangement allows photoswitchable moieties to interact with
      one another. The scaffold can also provide a dense arrangement of
      photoswitchable moieties, such that the solar thermal fuel can
      have increased energy storage capacity. The solar thermal fuel can
      also have increased thermal stability of the photoswitch
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Referring to FIG. 1a, solar thermal fuel 100 includes
      nanomaterial 110. Nanomaterial 110 is associated with a
      photoswitchable moieties 120 via associations 130. Associations
      130 can include covalent links (which can include, for example, a
      disulfide bond) or noncovalent associations involving, e.g., van
      der Waals forces, pi-pi interactions, hydrophobic interactions,
      steric interactions, hydrogen bonds, or electrostatic
      interactions. As illustrated schematically in FIG. 1a,
      photoswitchable moieties 120 are densely arranged on nanomaterial
      110, such that one photoswitchable moiety 120 can interact with an
      adjacent photoswitchable moiety 120 (interactions between
      photoswitchable moieties 120 shown as dashed lines). The
      arrangement of photoswitchable moieties 120 on nanomaterial 110
      can be in a regular, repeating pattern, such that many
      photoswitchable moieties 120 can consecutively interact with their
      adjacent neighbors. The regular, repeating pattern of
      photoswitchable moieties 120 can be determined by the structure of
      the nanomaterial, the structure of the association, the structure
      of the photoswitchable moieties, or a combination of these and
      other factors. For example, when nanomaterial 110 is a carbon
      nanotube, the regular, repeating pattern of photoswitchable
      moieties 120 can be determined by a regular, repeating pattern of
      carbon atoms in the nanotube framework; here the structure of the
      nanomaterial determines the pattern. In another example,
      nanomaterial 110 is a gold nanoparticle and association 130
      includes an alkylthiol chain covalently linking the
      photoswitchable moieties 120 to the nanomaterial. In this case,
      the regular repeating pattern can be determined by the size of the
      gold nanoparticles, and the structure (e.g., length and steric
      bulk) of the alkyl chains in the linker. The pattern can be
      selected so as to produce interactions between adjacent
      photoswitchable moieties 120, to provide solar thermal fuel 100
      with desirable energetic properties, described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] When illuminated with light hv of an appropriate frequency,
      photoswitchable moieties 120 are converted to an energy-storing
      form 125 of the photoswitchable moieties. The conversion to
      energy-storing form 125 typically involves a conformational change
      or the forming or breaking of covalent bonds. Energy-storing form
      125 remains associated with nanomaterial 110. Interactions between
      adjacent ones maybe stronger, weaker, or of a different nature or
      configuration than in lower energy form 120. Energy-storing form
      125 is desirably metastable, such that the reversion from
      energy-storing form 125 to lower energy form 120 is controllable,
      that is, reversion occurs only when a controllable stimulus (e.g.,
      heat, light, voltage, or a chemical reaction) is provided.
      Reversion from energy-storing form 125 to lower energy form 120
      releases energy, typically in the form of heat, which can be
      captured to provide useful work.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] A number of photoisomerization reactions, in particular
      conversion between norbornadiene and quadricyclane, and between
      anthracene and dianthracene, were investigated extensively for use
      in solar thermal fuels in the 1970's and 80's. While storage and
      retrieval of solar energy in these molecules was demonstrated
      experimentally, the concept of solar thermal fuels was generally
      dismissed as being practically unfeasible, primarily due to the
      degradation of the fuel such that it could not be resused after
      only a few cycles of energy conversion and release. See, e.g.,
      Phillippopoulos, C.; et al., J. Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev.
      1983, 22, 627-33, which is incorporated by reference in its
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A newer solar fuel candidate, tetracarbonyl-diruthenium
      fulvalene (Ru-fulvalene), that can cycle through this process
      numerous times-3 without degradation. See, for example, Boese, R.;
      et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997, 119, 6757-73, which is
      incorporated by reference in its entirety. Despite resistance to
      degradation, Ru-fulvalene is not a practical candidate for
      large-scale use due to the requirement for ruthenium, a rare and
      expensive element. To date, efforts to replace the ruthenium with
      cheaper and more abundant transition metals (e.g., iron) have
      faced displayed poor thermal stability and/or low energy density.
      In addition, while the gravimetric energy density of the
      Ru-fulvalene fuel is comparable to that of current Li-ion
      batteries, its volumetric energy density in solution is several
      orders of magnitude smaller, making portability unfeasible as well
      as increasing storage costs. See, e.g., Kanai, Y.; et al., Angew.
      Chem. 2010, 49, 8926-9, which is incorporated by reference in its
      entirety. Other efforts to increase the energy storage capacity
      via substitution of functional groups in several
      photoisomerizations have lead only to small (~10-20%) increases in
      [Delta]H, and often in an undesired decrease of Ea.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Azobenzenes are another well studied class of
      photoswitchable moities. See, e.g., Halabieh, R. H. E.; et al.,
      Pure Appl. Chem. 2004, 76, 1445-65, which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. Additional photoswitchable moieties
      include stilbene, norbornadiene-quadricyclane, and
      spiropyran-merocyanine.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Nanomaterial scaffolds preferably have properties including
      rigidity; ordered and closely spaced sites for PSMs to attach or
      adsorb on the scaffold; the ability to covalently link to PSMs;
      high solubility; transparency to UV/vis light; low mass and/or
      volume; low thermal conductivity; and low cost. Nanomaterials
      suitable as scaffolds include, but are not limited to carbon-based
      materials such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., pentacene);
      graphite; graphene; conjugated alkene chains (e.g.,
      polyacetylenes); fullerenes; and carbon nanotubes (including
      multiwall and single-wall carbon nanotubes). Additional examples
      of nanomaterial scaffolds include a beta-carotene; a porphyrin; a
      sugar-phosphate chain (e.g., as found in a nucleic acid); a boron
      nitride nanotube or nanosheet; a transition metal dichalcogenide
      (e.g., molybdenum disulfide) nanotube or molecular chain, a
      nanoparticle, a nanowire, or a nanosheet; a semiconductor (e.g., a
      group IV, group II-VI, or group III-V) nanowire or nanoparticle;
      or a transition metal oxide nanowire or nanoparticle.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a modifiable nanomaterial
      suitable for acting as a scaffold for a photoswitchable moiety.
      The photoswitchable moiety (PSM) can be covalently linked to, or
      adsorbed on, the carbon nanotube. Another nanomaterial including
      ordered and closely spaced sites for PSMs to attach or adsorb on
      the scaffold are nucleic acids, in particular double stranded DNA,
      which can also provide rigidity.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The potential advantages of PSM/CNT hybrid nanostructures
      as solar thermal fuels stem from the close-packed, ordered array
      of photoswitchable moieties imposed by the CNT scaffold (see FIG.
      2, and Feng, Y.; et al., J. Appl. Phys. 2007, 102, 053102, 1-5,
      which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). This
      quasi-crystalline state-which, importantly, persists when the
      nanostructures are in solution-has two key implications. First,
      the number of PSM per volume (i.e., photoisomer concentration) is
      significantly increased with respect to a solution of free
      photomolecules. For the case of azobenzenes as PSM, depending on
      the solubility of a given substituted azobenzene species, the
      PSM/CNT hybrid can have a volumetric energy density of 5-7 orders
      of magnitude greater than a solution of the free azobenzene. See,
      e.g., Takagishi, T.; et al., Colloid Polym. Sci. 2007, 232, 693-9,
      which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Second, the
      proximity and the ordered arrangement of the PSM on the scaffold
      enable systematic manipulation of the inter- and intra-molecular
      interactions between and within the PSM, providing a highly
      effective set of tuning parameters for maximizing both the energy
      storage capacity and the storage lifetime of the solar thermal
      fuel. Additional tuning parameters include the molecular packing
      density; the chemistry of the linker group that covalently links
      the PSM to the CNT; the diameter of the CNT; and the orientation
      of the PSM-and any functional groups on the PSM-with respect to
      the CNT.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] A set of hybrid nanostructures composed of azobenzene
      derivatives (collectively referred to as "azo" in the following)
      covalently bound to CNT substrates have been developed and
      studied. These are referred to below as azo/CNT structures or the
      azo/CNT system. Numerous azo compounds are known; see, for
      example, Zollinger, H., Azo and Diazo Chemistry, Interscience, New
      York, 1961, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In some embodiments, a photoswitchable diazobenzene moiety
      can have formula (I):<br>

      [0060] a can be 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4; b is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5; and can
      represent an optional covalent link to the nanomaterial.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The azo/CNT structures have several practical advantages as
      a solar thermal fuel. Azobenzenes have previously been studied for
      energy storage. See, e.g., Taoda, H.; et al., Chem. Eng. Jpn.
      1987, 20, 265-70; and Olmstead, J.; et al., Sol. Energy 1983, 30,
      271-4; each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
      While azo/CNT structures have not been studied for energy storage,
      they can be experimentally synthesized, and the resulting hybrid
      nanostructures are observed to have closepacked arrays of
      covalently attached azobenzene molecules aligned parallel to the
      long axis of the nanotube. Furthermore, reversible photoinduced
      switching between the metastable cis and trans isomers of the
      azobenzene moieties has been experimentally demonstrated. See, for
      example, Feng, Y.; et al., J. Appl. Phys. 2007, 102, 053102, 1-5;
      and Simmons, J. M.; et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 2007, 98, 086802,
      1-4; each of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety.
      Finally, the photoinduced behavior of numerous azobenzene
      derivatives both in solution and on substrates has been well
      studied, demonstrating high cyclability and providing a wealth of
      information to guide the design of an optimal hybrid system. See,
      for example, Halabieh, R. H. E.; et al., Pure Appl. Chem. 2004,
      76, 1445-65; McNellis, E.; et al., Phys. Rev. B 2009, 80, 035414;
      and Klajn, R. Pure Appl. Chem. 2010, 82, 2247-79; each of which is

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>

      [0062] Density functional theory was used to investigate several
      new solar thermal fuel candidates based on the azo/CNT system.
      Dramatic effects on energy density and thermal stability enabled
      by the presence of the substrate and the crystalline-like
      azobenzene state were determined. The chemical and geometric
      interactions that led to this behavior are described. It is
      possible to obtain azo/CNT solar thermal fuels with volumetric
      energy densities comparable to or even larger than that of
      state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries.<br>

      We employed the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient
      approximation(PBE-GGA) to exchange and correlation. Simulation
      supercells included 15 Å of vacuum separating periodic copies in
      the y- and z-directions. The nanotube long axis was oriented along
      the x-direction with a periodicity of 4.24 Å or multiples thereof
      (to determine the behavior with respect to separation distance).
      Convergence of total energies and electronic properties was
      achieved for an 8*1*1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point sampling for the
      smallest simulation cell. To determine the minimum energy
      structures, several initial positions/orientations of the azo
      molecules were considered. All atoms were fully relaxed until the
      force on each was less than 0.01 eV/Å. Nudged elastic band
      calculations were performed to determine transition pathways and
      thermal barriers. See Kolpak, A. M., and Grossman, J. C., Nano

      <b>[0065] Results and Discussion</b><b><br>

      [0066] FIG. 2 illustrates calculated properties of a row of
      cis-2,2'-dihydroxy-diazobenzene molecules covalently bound to an
      (8,0) CNT via amide linkers at the para position. FIG. 3 shows the
      computed values of [Delta]H for a number of representative azo/CNT
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] As the figure indicates, a significant increase in [Delta]H
      compared to an isolated azobenzene molecule (dashed line) was
      observed in all cases. The increased energy difference between the
      cis and trans configurations arose from a combination of effects,
      as emphasized by the shaded regions for the examples shown in FIG.
      3. In particular, the increase of [Delta]H with respect to
      isolated azobenzene arose from the presence of the CNT substrate
      which (i) imposes a close-packed crystalline-like state, (ii)
      breaks molecular symmetry, and (iii) enables design of specific
      ordered, fixed interactions between functional groups on
      neighboring molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The primary role of the CNT is to facilitate a crystalline,
      closepacked, ordered arrangement of the photactive molecules. The
      effect of the molecular packing is demonstrated in FIG. 2b, which
      plots the energy of cis and trans azobenzene molecules as a
      function of their separation distance. As the figure shows, the
      energy of the metastable cis isomer (circles) initially decreased
      with decreasing intermolecular distance due to attractive
      [pi]-[pi] interactions between neighboring molecules, which led to
      a shallow minimum for a separation of ~6 Å. Below 6 Å, the energy
      increased steeply as repulsive interactions began to dominate the
      behavior. As demonstrated by the large deviations in both the
      C-N-N angle and the angle between intramolecular phenyl groups in
      this regime (FIG. 2c), neighboring azobenzene groups prevent each
      other from attaining their minimum energy geometry, decreasing the
      overlap of the N-N [pi] states and thus weakening the diazo bond
      and shifting the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
      significantly upward in energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In contrast, the energy of the trans state (squares)
      exhibited a minimum for an intermolecular separation of ~4.24 Å,
      the distance between every fourth carbon atom along the CNT axis.
      In this case, steric effects did not play an important role, as
      the molecules were essentially planar in the trans state. Instead,
      the optimal intermolecular distance was determined primarily by
      the interactions between [pi]-electrons in neighboring phenyl
      rings. The net result of the packing interactions was thus a large
      increase in the magnitude of [Delta]H with decreasing
      intermolecular distance. As FIG. 2b shows, the packing
      interactions due to unsubstituted azobenzene alone led to a net
      increase of 0.2 eV per molecule in the magnitude of [Delta]H for a
      spacing of 4.24 Å. In other words, the formation of an ordered
      close-packed array increased the energy storage capacity per
      molecule by ~30% compared to gas-phase azobenzene.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] It is clear that van der Waals interactions, which can be
      poorly described within DFT (depending on the choice of
      functional), can play an important role in these ordered
      structures. A set of test calculations was therefore performed
      with several functionals that provided a more accurate description
      of weak interactions. Employing the semiempirical Grimme
      functional as implemented in Quantum Espresso and the wB97XD and
      M06 hybrid functionals in Gaussian09, a 12-17% reduction in
      [Delta]H for all of the systems in FIG. 3 was observed. However, a
      similar reduction was also observed in the computed [Delta]H
      values of the corresponding nontemplated azobenzenes; for example,
      the value of [Delta]H for unsubstituted azobenzene in the gas
      phase was found to be 0.49 eV, which was smaller than both the
      PBE-GGA and the experimental values (~0.59 eV). Consequently, the
      fractional increase in [Delta]H due to the packing interactions on
      the CNT template was relatively insensitive to the inclusion of
      weak interactions. In addition to providing a template for ordered
      interactions, the CNT substrate also produced a significant effect
      on [Delta]H by breaking the symmetry of the azobenzene molecules.
      When the molecules are bound to the CNT, several orientations were
      possible depending on the position of the linker group with
      respect to the nitrogen double bond in the azobenzene. The large
      geometry changes and the subsequent changes in [Delta]H are
      illustrated for three different azo derivatives bound to CNT
      substrates with ortho, meta, and para attachments. In most of the
      azo/CNT systems investigated, the ortho attachment was
      energetically preferred over the other possible attachments in
      both the cis and trans states. This stability, which arose from
      strong proximity-induced interactions between the linker and the
      azobenzene and between the azobenzene and the CNT, resulted in a
      relatively minor increase in [Delta]H for the nonsubstituted
      azobenzene, as indicated in FIG. 3. In contrast, systems with the
      linker in the para position tended to have the least stable cis
      configuration, resulting in larger values of [Delta]H.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In addition to packing and orientation effects, the CNT
      substrate enabled specific, fixed interactions between neighboring
      molecules, which can have significant effects on the energetics of
      the system. For example, in the hybrid nanostructure,
      substitutional groups can interact with neighboring molecules with
      a much higher frequency than in solution. Furthermore, they
      interact in an ordered manner, potentially providing a systematic
      route toward designing the properties of the hybrid nanostructure.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Substitution of hydroxyl groups for one or more hydrogens
      on the phenyl rings has been investigated, with the aim of
      modifying the relative stability of the two isomers via the
      addition of H-bonds. In general, structures with more H-bonds
      and/or stronger (shorter) H-bonds are more stable; thus,
      maximizing the number of H-bonds in the trans state while
      minimizing the H-bonds in the cis state will provide a larger
      [Delta]H. In addition, H-bonds composed of OH . . . N are
      typically found to be stronger than those with OH . . . O. Because
      of the symmetry breaking imposed by the CNT, it was therefore
      possible to optimize [Delta]H by choosing the position of hydroxyl
      groups (or other functional groups). For example, FIG. 4, which
      shows several possible patterns for two OH groups on an azobenzene
      with a linker in the meta position, illustrates the dependence of
      [Delta]H on the relative positions of two hydroxyl groups; these
      positions determined the number and strength of the H-bonds in the
      cis and trans configurations. As FIG. 3 shows, these interactions
      provide a very effective means of tuning the properties of the
      solar thermal fuel; just considering two hydroxyl substituents
      yielded an increase in the energy stored per molecule of up to a
      factor of 3 compared to gas phase azobenzene; additional hydroxyl
      groups and/or other functional groups may increase [Delta]H even
      further.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The utility of a solar thermal fuel is contingent not only
      upon its energy storage capacity but also on its thermal stability
      in the photoexcited state. In most azobenzene derivatives, the
      half-life of the photoexcited state is on the order of minutes to
      hours due to a relatively low thermal barrier for the cis-trans
      back reaction. See, for example, Sanchez, A. M.; de Rossi, R. H.
      J. Org. Chem. 1995, 60, 2974; and Haitjema, H.; Y, T.; Challa, G.
      Macromolecules 1995, 28, 2783; each of which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. As mentioned above, simultaneously
      increasing both [Delta]H and Ea is challenging, as methods to
      increase the former often rely on decreasing the latter. This is
      observed, for example, for the unsubstituted meta- and ortho
      azo/CNT structures illustrated in FIG. 3; the increase in [Delta]H
      relative to gas phase azobenzene was almost all due to the
      destabilizing effect of the packing interactions on the cis
      isomer, which leads to a concomitant decrease in Ea.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] One can, however, increase both Ea and [Delta]H by
      designing interactions that will stabilize the cis configuration
      by some amount E and the trans configuration by some larger amount
      E+[delta]E. As a result of the symmetry-breaking, the short
      intermolecular separation, and the fixed orientation of azobenzene
      molecules on a CNT substrate, the positions of functional groups
      provide an ideal means by which to achieve this goal. For example,
      in the simplest picture, increasing the stability of the cis
      configuration by enabling the formation of n H-bonds, each with an
      average energy of EH-bond, while also stabilizing the trans state
      with n+1 H-bonds will increase both Ea and [Delta]H by EH-bond.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 1b illustrates a successful example of an azo/CNT
      nanostructure with both enhanced energy storage and thermal
      stability. In this case, six H-bonds per molecule (four
      intramolecular H-bonds and two intermolecular H-bonds formed
      between neighbors around the CNT circumference) significantly
      stabilized the trans configuration, while four H-bonds per
      molecule increased the stability of the cis configuration. The net
      result was a 260% increase in [Delta]H and a 20% increase in Ea
      relative to gas phase azobenzene. Using the experimental rate for
      the thermal cis-trans reaction (see, e.g., Rau, H. Photochemistry
      and Photophysics; CRC Press: Boca Ratan, 1990), and the computed
      values of Ea, the photoexcited state of the azo/CNT nanostructure
      shown in FIG. 1b was predicted to exhibit a half-life of greater
      than one year, an enormous improvement in stability compared to
      gas phase azobenzene.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Depending on the azo orientation, an (8,0) carbon nanotube
      was found to support 4-8 azobenzene molecules around the
      circumference for each 4.24 Å distance along the CNT long axis.
      Approximating each azo/CNT nanostructure as a cylinder with outer
      bounds determined by the van der Waals radii, and assuming the
      maximum packing efficiency for cylinders (79.2%), the azo/CNT
      systems discussed above can have volumetric energy densities up to
      690 Wh/L (see FIG. 5), comparable to the theoretical volumetric
      energy densities in state of the art Li-ion batteries (200-600
      Wh/L) (see, e.g., Chen, Y. H.; et al., Power Sources 2010, 195,
      2851-62, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety), and
      4 orders of magnitude greater than that of the Ru-fulvalene solar
      thermal fuel. The volumetric energy density of
      tetracarbonyl-diruthenium fulvalene was determined to be ~0.02
      Wh/L based on the concentration reported in Phillippopoulos, C.;
      et al., J. Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Dev. 1983, 22, 627-33, which
      is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Furthermore, the
      azo/CNT nanostructures exhibited a 7-fold increase in volumetric
      energy density compared to solid azobenzene (~90 Wh/L); an even
      larger improvement was observed relative to various substituted
      azobenzenes in solution, which have volumetric energy densities on
      the order of 10&lt;-2 &gt;to 10&lt;-7 &gt;Wh/L, depending on the
      substituent and the solvent. See, e.g., Takagishi, T.; et al.,
      Colloid Polym. Sci. 2007, 232, 693-9, which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. These values clearly illustrated the
      utility of including nanoscale components as a means to increase
      the energy storage capacity of common photoswitch molecules. The
      same approach can be applied to other photoswitch/nanoscale
      substrate hybrids.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The volumetric energy density estimated above was
      determined under the assumption that the azo/CNT nanostructures
      are sufficiently soluble in some medium to achieve a very high
      packing density (corresponding to a molar concentration of
      ~4.6*10&lt;3&gt;). Because of exposed OH functional groups on the
      outer "surface" of the hybrid nanostructures (e.g., see FIG. 1b),
      most of the nanostructures were predicted to be water-soluble.
      Tests showed that additional substitution with polar functional
      groups at positions that are exposed to the solvent in both the
      cis and trans states (and thus do not interact significantly with
      neighboring azobenzenes or the CNT substrate) can also be
      performed without a net change in [Delta]H or Ea, thereby enabling
      one to tune solubility as well. Furthermore, as a result of the
      close-packed array of azobenzene molecules on the CNT substrate,
      there is little room to admit solvent molecules in between
      azobenzene molecules, so one could, for example, also include
      hydrophobic interactions between azobenzene molecules without
      impacting the water solubility of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In addition to high solubility, the functionalized
      nanotubes may achieve a very high concentration given that the
      photoactive azobenzene molecules on each nanotube are already in a
      crystalline state. For example, an azo/CNT nanostructure in a
      dilute water solution will have a shell of solvent water molecules
      interacting via hydrogen bonds with the exposed OH groups.
      Similarly, an azo/CNT nanostructure in a close packed array of
      azo/CNT nanostructures will also interact primarily via H-bonds,
      in this case between OH groups on neighboring azo/CNT
      nanostructures as well as with OH groups on surrounding water
      molecules. Therefore, one can reasonably consider formation of a
      highly concentrated solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The concentration-independent close-packed crystalline
      structure of the azobenzene adsorbates also suggested that the
      presence of a polar solvent will not disrupt the H-bond
      interactions that play such an important role in determining
      [Delta]H and Ea, as most interactions with the solvent will be
      mediated through surface polar groups and thus not affect the
      intra- and intermolecular interactions between azobenzene
      molecules. As a first-order test of this prediction, DFT
      calculations including solvent effects for 11 different templated
      azobenzene derivatives (including all those in FIG. 3) were
      performed via the polarizable continuum model implemented in
      Gaussian09. As illustrated in FIG. 6, the results confirmed the
      minor role of solvent interactions, showing only a small change in
      [Delta]H (3 and 2% decreases for water and benzene solvents,
      respectively) over all 11 derivatives.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] An important consequence of this behavior was that, unlike
      H-bonds between free molecules in solution, the H-bond
      interactions in the azo/CNT system did not provide a significant
      entropic contribution to the free energy of the system by breaking
      and reforming with high frequency. Breaking an inter- or
      intramolecular H-bond in the ordered state requires rotation of
      the phenyl rings, a mode that is sterically inhibited by the short
      intermolecular separation of the azobenzene molecules and the
      rigidity of the structure. Test computations of the barrier to
      phenyl rotation for close-packed azobenzene molecules confirmed
      this picture, indicating that events requiring such rotations will
      not occur at any reasonable temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] While simultaneously increasing the volumetric energy
      density and the thermal stability is an important goal in
      designing a practical high-energy density solar thermal fuel,
      several other properties require consideration. In particular, the
      heat released by the back reaction is important in many
      applications. Assuming that the heat capacity, Cp, is similar to
      that of azobenzene, the temperature of the heat released upon
      cis-trans isomerization in the azo/CNT system is Treleased
      [Delta]H/Cp=620 K. In contrast, Trelease 220 K for azobenzene
      without the CNT substrate. Investigation into mechanisms for
      lowering the heat capacity could enable the hybrid system to
      produce even higher temperatures; further increases in [Delta]H
      will also lead to increases in Trelease.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Finally, knowledge of the overall efficiency of the
      solar-to-heat conversion in the azo/CNT nanostructures is useful
      for comparison between different types of energy conversion
      systems. The overall conversion efficiency of the azo/CNT solar
      thermal fuel is given by [eta]=fabsorbedfconverted, where
      fabsorbed is the fraction of the AM1.5 solar irradiance absorbed
      by azobenzene and fconverted is the fraction of photons that are
      stored and eventually converted to heat. Assuming that every
      absorbed photon induces an isomerization event, the latter is
      given by fconverted=[Delta]H [integral]0&lt;v&gt;&lt;gap &gt;hvdv,
      where hvgap=Egap is the band gap (or the energy difference between
      the highest) of azobenzene (~2.8 eV). For [Delta]H=1.7 eV, we find
      a total efficiency, representing both conversion and storage, of
      [eta]=7.2%.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] As shown by DFT computations, combining the photoactive
      behavior of well-known photoisomers with the structural stability
      and nanoscale properties of CNTs, one obtains a set of highly
      tunable hybrid nanostructures that exhibit large increases in both
      the energy storage capacity per molecule and the number of
      photoactive molecules per volume. Together, these properties
      result in volumetric energy densities ~10&lt;4 &gt;greater than
      that of the Ru-fulvalene solar thermal fuel and equivalent to or
      higher than those reported for state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In addition, intermolecular interactions available in the
      hybrid nanostructures can simultaneously increase the energy
      storage capacity and the lifetime of the photoexcited state. Thus,
      a clean, renewable, and potentially economically feasible pathway
      toward long-term storage and convenient use of solar energy on a
      large scale is described. In addition, other hybrid
      photoisomer-nanostructure hybrids can be created using other
      photoactive molecules, different substrates, and different linker
      chemistries, to provide a range of degradation resistant,
      high-stability, high-energy density solar thermal fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Other configurations of PSM and nanotemplate are possible.
      For example, FIGS. 7-12 illustrate solar thermal fuel materials
      including azo moieties linked to various templates: graphene (FIG.
      7), a fullerene (FIG. 8), pentacene (FIG. 9), and conjugated
      alkene chains (FIGS. 10-12). FIG. 13 illustrates a
      norbornadiene-pentacene material. FIG. 14 depicts two
      photoswitchable moieties based on nucleotides (modified nucleotide
      azobenzene photoisomers (MNAPs), where the two photoswitchable
      moieties are capable of interacting via H-bonds in a manner
      analogous to the C-G Watson-Crick base pair. FIGS. 15A-15C show
      structures of DNA-like double helices including MNAPs in place of
      the naturally occurring A, C, G, and T bases. FIG. 16 illustrates
      a material using graphene as a template and MNAPs as
      photoswitchable moieties.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] We examined the behavior of two general classes of
      azobenzene derivatives, illustrated in Scheme 1, bound to various
      template materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] PSMs in the first class (class I, scheme 1a) contain an
      amido (-CONH-) group meta to the nitrogen double bond that acts as
      a covalent linker to the template; this linker was chosen as it
      has been used successfully to functionalize CNTs with azobenzene
      molecules in previous experiments. In addition to the amido
      linker, the class I azobenzenes have substituents at the three
      ortho positions not adjacent to the linker. Hydroxyl (-OH) groups
      were attached at the 2 and 2' carbons, and either -OH or -F was
      attached at the 6' carbon atom to form azobenzene derivatives 1a
      (m-amido-2,2',6'-trihydroxyazobenzene) and 1b
      (m-amido-2'-fluoro-2,6'-dihydroxyazobenzene), respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The second class of azobenzene derivatives (class II,
      scheme 1b) contained PSMs formed by adding a (phenylazo-) group to
      azobenzene to make 1,3-bis(phenylazo)benzene derivatives. As the
      scheme indicates, the class II PSMs, which were covalently bound
      to the template via a direct C-C bond, contain two azo groups per
      attachment site to the template. Consequently, the amount of
      stored energy per molecule can be potentially doubled while only
      increasing the molecular weight (and volume) by about 33%, leading
      to significant gains in energy density.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Three particular class II derivatives were the subject of
      particular focus. The first,
      1,3-bis(2',6'-dihydroxyphenylazo)-2-aminobenzene (2a;
      R&lt;1&gt;=template, R&lt;2&gt;-NH2, R&lt;3&gt;-OH,
      R&lt;4&gt;-R&lt;5&gt;-H) was a close analogue of 1a; the amino
      group in 2a replaces a hydroxyl group in 1a to enable the same
      number and position of H-bonds to form per azo group in both
      molecules. In the other class II molecules,
      1,3-bis(2'-hydroxy-4'-carboxy-6'-fluorophenylazo)-2-amino-4,6-difluorobenzene







      (2b; R&lt;1&gt;=template, R&lt;2&gt;-NH2, R&lt;3&gt;-F,
      R&lt;4&gt;-COOH, R&lt;5&gt;-F) and
      1,3-bis(2'-hydroxy-6'-fluorophenylazo)-benzene-4,6-diol (2c;
      R&lt;1&gt;-H, R&lt;2&gt;=template, R&lt;3&gt;-F, R&lt;4&gt;-H,
      R&lt;5&gt;-OH), both the functional groups and/or the position of
      the template with respect to the azo groups are modified to
      further enhance the energetic and optical properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The role of the template was investigated by determining
      the average energy stored per molecule [Delta]E for class I
      molecules on each of the five templates. Here<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where N is the number of distinct binding sites on a given
      template. For example, on a CNT template, one might expect all
      binding sites to be essentially identical (assuming an ordered
      phase), whereas the geometric and chemical environments of a
      photoisomer attached to an alkene chain molecular template will
      vary significantly depending on whether the binding site is near
      the center or at the end of the chain, as manifest in e.g. FIGS.
      17c and 17d).<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The ability of the template to constrain the molecular
      degrees of freedom of the bound photoisomers-or, put another way,
      the resistance of the template to photoisomer-induced
      deformation-played a key role in determining both the dominant
      type and the strength of interactions between neighboring
      photoisomers. In turn, these intermolecular interactions
      ultimately governed the amount of energy that can be stored in
      each photo-active molecule, as well as the thermal stability of
      the higher-energy state (i.e., the fully cis configuration). The
      variation in the degree of order in the photoisomer/template
      structures can be seen clearly in FIG. 17, which depicts the
      optimized atomic structures for the fully cis and fully trans
      configurations of the class I azobenzene/template hybrids. As the
      figure shows, the magnitude of [Delta]E decreases significantly as
      the photoisomer arrays became less regular in going from the rigid
      graphene and CNT templates to the more flexible molecular
      templates such as pentacene and the 12-C alkene chain
      (dodecahendecaene).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In the most rigid photoisomer/template hybrid, the bound
      molecules formed a highly ordered two-dimensional array on the
      planar graphene template, as shown in FIG. 17a. As a result of
      this packing, rotations of the photoisomers (or parts of the
      photoisomers) were highly constrained by interactions with
      neighboring molecules or with the graphene itself. Since the
      extended nature of the graphene did not allow sufficiently large
      local template deformation to relax these constraints, the bound
      photoisomers were forced to adopt a highly strained configuration
      in the cis state. In addition, the bound molecules were unable to
      form the maximum number of inter- and intramolecular H-bonds
      possible in an all-cis configuration: the pathway to this
      configuration from the minimum energy trans configuration was
      blocked by steric interactions that prevent the required rotations
      of the untethered phenyl ring. In contrast, the molecules in the
      planar trans state, which were stabilized by two intramolecular
      H-bonds, decrease in energy due to p-stacking interactions in the
      packed phase. The net result was a large increase in [Delta]E with
      respect to the gas phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Similar to graphene, CNT templates impose a highly ordered
      azobenzene phase in which the bound photoisomers were sterically
      prevented from rotation by the presence of close-packed neighbors
      along the nanotube axis (FIG. 17b). Similar to the graphene case,
      in the class I azo/CNT hybrid two intramolecular H-bonds (formed
      between the azo N atoms and two -OH substituents at ortho
      positions) stabilized the trans isomer, while a single
      intermolecular H-bond (formed between an -OH group and an azo N on
      a nearest-neighbor molecule) stabilized the cis isomer, which led
      to a significant increase in both [Delta]E and Ea relative to gas
      phase azobenzene. While the rigid nanotube template led to a
      highly ordered molecular packing along the CNT long axis, steric
      interactions with neighbors around the circumference of the
      nanotube were less important than in the azo/graphene hybrid,
      allowing for some relaxation of the strained cis configuration.
      Consequently, [Delta]E was smaller than that observed in the
      graphene case.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In contrast to both graphene and CNTs, molecular templates
      such as pentacene or dodecahendecaene (a fully conjugated 12-C
      alkene chain) can deform significantly in order to accommodate
      strain induced by the bound photoisomers. Consequently, the
      photoisomers, which were ordered along one direction as shown in
      FIGS. 17c and 17d, were able to rotate a significant amount around
      the plane of the template in order to increase nearest-neighbor
      separation distances and attain configurations more like the gas
      phase. Such distortions were possible because the less-extended
      molecular templates can twist to minimize the resulting strain in
      the template-photoisomer C-C bonds. In addition, the much shorter
      length of the photoisomer array (here, five azo molecules,
      compared to potentially thousands on graphene or carbon
      nanotubes), allowed the photoisomers to fan out in the plane of
      the template, thus adopting a less strained cis configuration. As
      a result of the additional degrees of freedom available to
      photoisomers bound to a pentacene or alkene chain template, the
      increase in [Delta]E with respect to the gas phase was smaller
      than that observed in the analogous azo/graphene and azo/CNT
      nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Although the template itself did not deform significantly,
      a similar result was observed for photoisomers on fullerene (C60):
      in this case, the high curvature of the template along all
      directions minimizes the impact of intermolecular interactions, as
      shown in FIG. 17e. As a result, the bound azobenzene molecules
      behaved quite similarly to their gas phase analogues, the
      energetic properties of which are summarized, along with those of
      the azo/template systems, in Table 1. Table 1 shows computed
      energetic properties. [Delta]H is the stored energy per azo group,
      Ea is the thermal barrier (per azo group) to the cis-trans back
      reaction, [rho]grav is the gravimetric energy density, and max
      [rho]vol is the maximum volumetric energy density (i.e., for the
      material in a solid state). Trelease is the estimated temperature
      of the heat released upon triggering the cis-trans conversion,
      assuming the material has the same heat capacity as solid
      azobenzene. t1/2 is the estimated half-life of the cis isomer,
      assuming the same prefactor as for unsubstituted azobenzene.<br>

      [0095] Although a decrease in the magnitude of [Delta]E was
      observed with decreasing template rigidity for the class I
      azobenzene/template nanostructures, the data in Table 1 showed
      that, with the exception of the fullerene, all of the template
      materials considered enhanced the desired energetic properties of
      the bound photoisomer, demonstrating the general extensibility of
      the templating concept for designing solar thermal fuels with
      increased energy density and thermal stability. The trend observed
      in FIG. 17 suggests that the energy storage capacity of the
      molecular templates can be increased by making them less flexible
      and thereby increasing the ordering of the bound photoisomers.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] FIG. 18, which shows the optimized atomic structures and
      [Delta]E values for class II azobenzene/template hybrids,
      illustrated one successful method for increasing the order of the
      photoisomer array on pentacene and dodecahendecaene templates:
      increasing the rigidity of the photoisomers themselves. The class
      II molecules were inherently stiffer than their class I cousins
      due to the increased (planar) area of the molecule. Consequently,
      [Delta]E exhibited significantly less variation between templates
      with these molecules, as comparison of the trends for the similar
      1a/template and 2a/template systems in Table 1 shows. In the
      former, the magnitude of the stored energy per molecule, the
      volumetric energy density, and the gravimetric energy density all
      decrease in the order CNT-pentacene-alkene chain, while in the
      latter, the energy densities show the opposite trend, alkene
      chain-pentacene -CNT, despite the small decrease in [Delta]E for
      the pentacene and alkene chain templates.<br>
