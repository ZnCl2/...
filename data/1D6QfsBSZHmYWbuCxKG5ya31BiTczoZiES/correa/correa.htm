        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Dr. Paulo Correa, M.Sc.,
            Ph.D., Partner and Director of Research at Labofex-
            Experimental and Applied Plasma Physics of Concord, Ontario
            and Partner Alexandra Correa, (Hon) BA are today announcing
            a significant breakthrough in the field of clean power
            generation. The technical basis for the extraction process
            has been a carefully guarded secret until full disclosure
            was secured through the granting of three US patents: US
            Patent #'s 5,416,391, issued on May 16, 1995 and entitled
            "Electromechanical Transduction of Plasma Pulses";
            5,449,989, issued September 12, 1995, entitled "Energy
            Conversion System" and 5,502,354, issued on March 26, 1996,
            entitled "Direct Current Energized Pulse Generator Utilizing
            Autogenous Cyclical Pulsed Abnormal Glow Discharges". The
            Correa grid-independent Energy Conversion System utilizes an
            energy reactor whose function is based upon heretofore
            unknown spontaneous emission properties of certain metals in
            vacuum and involves an anomalous cathode reaction force
            conforming to Dr. H. Aspden's Law of Electrodynamics. The
            associated Motor Drive provides for direct electromechanical
            transformation of the energy accumulated within the reactor.
            The reactor may be conceived of as a portable vacuum battery
            made active only when needed. The Correa technology employs
            cold-cathode vacuum discharge plasma reactors to set up
            self-exciting oscillations, in the form of pulsed abnormal
            glow discharges triggered by auto-electronic emissions, in
            order to produce power. The circuit is driven from a direct
            current source of impedance sufficient to prevent
            establishment of a sustained vacuum arc discharge. In
            combination with a special circuit, electrical power, in
            excess of the input power needed for operation, can be
            extracted. The System, therefore, may also be referred to as
            an over-unity system: where net energy output greatly
            exceeds net energy input. Unlike the cold fusion process,
            which claims to output low grade heat, the Correa technology
            directly generates electricity at power voltage levels,
            without any utilization of cold or thermonuclear fusion
            principles. Another important feature of the apparatus is
            that it employs no radioactive compounds and generates no
            nuclear radiation or radioisotopes. The energy system is
            entirely pollution-free, self-contained and composed of
            readily recyclable materials. Storage of the power produced
            may be carried out by traditional means, be these mechanical
            or electrical.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Energy conversion system
            applications for electric vehicles, stand-alone power
            supplies and autonomous housing are currently under
            development. The inventors hope that by making vehicles
            self-sufficient in terms of energy, this technology will
            offer the possibility of bypassing massive infrastructure
            expansions in order to make the electric vehicle a feasible
            reality while solving the problem of range which currently
            detracts from its appeal. Other potential applications
            include- pulsed lasers, inverters, transformer and motor
            circuits. The inventors are presently engaged in negotiating
            licensing agreements with a view to development of the
            applications.</font> </p>

          <b>Arthur Axelrad</b></div>
        <p align="left">I would like to tell you what I know about Dr.
          Paulo Correa and his partner and wife Alexandra, two people
          who have recently done something marvelous. What they have
          done is to make a series of startling discoveries in basic
          science - beginning with their work in plasma physics, a field
          that is almost certainly going to have a major impact on our
          world in the near future. The Correas have now convincingly
          demonstrated the principle that it is possible to release from
          charged metals in a vacuum amounts of free energy which exceed
          the amounts of energy put into the system. </p>
        <p align="left">Since I am not trained in this field, I will not
          be able to discuss the scientific details of the Correas'
          discoveries. However, what I would like to say should speak to
          what the experience and achievements of the Correas can teach
          us about the way science happens, what can happen to
          scientists, and why it matters. </p>
        <p align="left">I have known Paulo Correa for more than twenty
          years, first during his development as my graduate student,
          then as a biomedical scientist and partner, and over these
          many years, as a close friend. I can therefore claim to know
          him very well, giving me at least some of the qualifications
          required to be able to write about him. And I can also tell
          you a little about the work we have done together at the
          University of Toronto. </p>
        <p align="left">Our friendship is, I believe, unique. We listen
          to one another, we trust one another, and we can even
          criticize one another without fear. We seek and give each
          other advice without risking the other's ire. We can rev up
          each other's intellectual motors, and we can build on each
          other's ideas. </p>
        <p align="left">Perhaps our most exciting time in the laboratory
          came when Paulo and I were confronted with a contradiction
          that existed in the biomedical literature. It arose out of
          studies on patients with the chronic myeloproliferative
          disorder Polycythemia vera (PV), a potentially lethal
          condition of unknown cause in which a major increase in number
          of circulating red blood cells occurs. In such patients, the
          question arose 'Are the progenitors of the red blood cells
          entirely independent of the growth factor that normally
          regulates the numbers of these cells, or are the progenitor
          cells in this disorder overly sensitive to the action of the
          growth factor?' Opposite answers to this question appeared in
          publications from different laboratories. Experiments of this
          kind were all carried out on cells in culture, and it became
          evident to us that the question could not be resolved as long
          as research on the problem had to be carried out in culture
          media that contained serum. Serum is an extremely complex
          fluid that contains both known and undefined growth factors
          which can dramatically affect red blood cell production. Paulo
          and I tackled this problem by first devising a cell culture
          medium that did not contain serum and so was free of these
          growth factors. Cells in this medium remained alive but did
          not grow to form colonies unless growth factor was added. Now
          experiments could be done against a clean background. We first
          investigated the responses of PV and normal progenitor cells
          to different quantities of the growth factor that was known to
          be the one that regulates red blood cell production in the
          normal adult, ie erythropoietin (Epo). Surprisingly, we found
          that the sensitivities of PV and normal progenitor cells to
          Epo were identical. The PV progenitor cells were found to be
          much more sensitive than normal to another growth factor,
          Insulin- like growth factor-1 or IGF-1, the factor that
          regulates red blood cell production in the fetus! </p>
        <p align="left">Obviously, the critical entity that permitted
          these findings to be made was the serum-free medium we had
          devised. We patented this medium in the US and in Canada. </p>
        <p align="left">As far back as I have known him, Paulo Correa
          was unafraid to challenge his professors if he thought they
          were wrong, no matter what the consequences. He is a
          biomedical scientist who, after contributing to the field of
          fundamental cell biology, rather than becoming someone else's
          postdoctoral student, set up an independent laboratory (under
          the company name Labofex) together with Alexandra, where they
          have now worked for the past 15 years. At the same time as
          they pursued full-time research careers in this laboratory
          without benefit of grants, they wrote music, poetry, painted,
          and invested money in the stock market with some failures but
          also with some striking successes that have provided a living
          for the two of them and the capital and maintenance costs of a
          first class biophysics laboratory. From early on I have called
          Paulo my Renaissance Man. </p>
        <p align="left">The work of the Correas began with an
          investigation of the pulsed abnormal glow discharge that
          occurs during electron emission from a cold cathode in a
          vacuum. At Labofex, the Correas pursued an experimental
          investigation of the electrodynamics of anomalous cathode
          reaction forces made manifest when the abnormal glow discharge
          was conditioned to pulsate autogenously. External pulsation of
          the abnormal glow had been previously investigated by Ernesto
          Manuel, who obtained the 1969 patent for the method used to
          this day in the plastic coating of softdrink cans! But the
          Correas discovered that, under defined physical conditions,
          the abnormal glow could be made to pulsate 'autogenously' by
          field emission. Anomalous cathode reaction forces developed by
          field emission in vacuum-arc discharges had been well known to
          physicists since the 1930's, and had led Dr. Harold Aspden of
          Southampton University, UK, in 1969 to enunciate his principle
          of an anomalous energy transfer in plasma between electrons
          and heavy ions, resulting in a vacuum-induced acceleration of
          electron flow and a progressive increase in electric current.
          Dr. Aspden had predicted that in such discharge tubes, the
          current would increase without limit for a constant applied
          voltage, and the tube would be destroyed unless some means
          were taken to limit the current. Previous electrodynamic
          experiments of this type in the US and in Russia had ended in
          failure, apparently because of electrode burn-out. </p>
        <p align="left">Alexandra Correa is an expert glassblower whose
          knowledge and skills were essential for designing the special
          vacuum tubes in which the autogenously pulsed abnormal glow
          discharges took place and on which the early experiments
          depended. It was during this phase of the work that her expert
          knowledge of vacuum design overcame the obstacles arising from
          the excessive heat generated in these systems and which made
          possible detailed studies on the pulsed abnormal glow
          discharge (PAGD). </p>
        <p align="left">But plasma physics was not destined to be the
          pathway along which the Correa research proceeded. The
          stimulus for that came from an entirely different direction.
          Aspden's 1969 Law of Electrodynamics had already fully
          accounted for the anomalous phenomenon of cathode reaction
          forces observed in field emission, and had shown that the
          interaction was affected by the ratio of masses of the charge
          carriers. In fact, the Correas seem to have been pushed into
          their current theoretical and experimental work by a variety
          of observations about electrodynamic interactions which,
          instead of involving monopolar massbound charges - such as
          electrons and heavy ions - implicated 'neutral' or ambipolar
          charges that were devoid of inertia; the energy involved was
          therefore mass-free. During this phase of their work,
          conducted at a second laboratory that they set up for this
          purpose (the Aurora Biophysics Research Institute, ABRI), they
          were greatly inspired by their systematic and critical reading
          of the works of Tesla and Reich. This led them to a
          mathematical and physical reexamination of electrodynamic
          interactions by a different approach and from a completely
          different point of view. The beginning point of this new
          approach was an investigation of the hitherto unexplained
          anomalous arrest of electroscopic discharges under a variety
          of well-defined conditions. And by the time they completed
          this phase of their work, they had discovered a method for
          magnifying mass- free electric radiation in excess of the
          massbound electric power that it consumed. Eventually, when
          they extended this knowledge to an understanding of
          nonelectric interactions of mass-free energy, they
          rediscovered the principles behind the elusive 'Orgone Motor'
          of Dr. Wilhelm Reich, and improved upon it to devise what they
          designate as the 'Aether Motor'. </p>
        <p align="left">One day, Barbara, my wife, and I witnessed a
          demonstration by Paulo and Alexandra Correa of this 'Aether
          Motor' - it was an electrical generating system that could
          deliver electrical power without any external power input save
          its connections to two 'orgone accumulator' boxes or to either
          our insulated bodies or a ground pipe. Since the device moved
          a motor and drove a circuitry, it had to consume some power;
          this appears to have been provided by the environment. The
          event occurred with incredible calm - no explosion, no noise
          even, no sudden heat, no bright light, just the quiet
          pulsation of a discharge tube and a quiet turning of a small
          rotor. Save for the driving of the motor from contact with our
          bodies, the effect was almost disappointingly banal. It has
          not always been that way. There were occasions during the
          evolution of these discoveries when accidental electrical
          discharges did threaten the lives of our intrepid pair.
          Fortunately, these accidents never deterred them. </p>
        <p align="left">The realization of what we were looking at was
          mind-boggling. Here before our eyes was what I was brought up
          to believe to be absolutely impossible! The implications were
          also enormous - a world of literally free energy without
          pollution by a 'product readily producible by available
          equipment and processes at a cost that allows mass marketing
          for multiple applications'. You would have expected a scene
          like a Boxing Day Sale in Toronto. But nothing like that
          happened. Why? I have given a lot of thought to that question.
        </p>
        <p align="left">When an investigator presents the scientific
          community with a concept that challenges previous beliefs,
          there follows a series of stereotyped responses: 'He (or she)
          is wrong.' 'He can't be right because it goes against what has
          long been accepted as true by everyone.' 'He is self-deluded
          but wants so desperately for his concept to be widely accepted
          that he unconsciously selects the data that fit and rejects
          the data that don't,' or - 'He's lying!' Or 'This isn't even
          his field, what right does he have to challenge the work of
          many years by highly trained experts?' Or 'He doesn't work out
          of a renowned university or institute or major company. How
          could he be doing anything like what he claims to be so
          important?' Or 'If we support a thing like this and it turns
          out to be a fraud, we'll have wasted our company's money and
          we'll be considered fools.' </p>
        <p align="left">Once all of these responses have been uttered
          and evidence overwhelmingly shows each to be unable to account
          for what is actually being seen, then it is time for a
          paradigm shift. I believe that this is what has been happening
          in the case of Paulo and Alexandra Correa. </p>
        <p align="left">The Internet is, in my opinion, the perfect
          medium for explorers like the Correas. It gets around any of
          the pettiness, the timidity, the ignorance, the lack of
          vision, the stupidity, the arrogance, the jealousy, the
          automatic negativity, the suspicion, or the dishonesty of some
          referees in the peer review system as it exists today. At the
          same time, the absence of a peer review system would be
          fraught with the danger of biases invisible to the scientists
          themselves; it thus places an enormous responsibility for
          integrity on them. Here the Correas shine. </p>
        <p align="left">And gradually, referees will emerge with the
          necessary qualities who can assess the work fairly no matter
          how blatantly it challenges the existing paradigm. In the case
          of the Correas, this is already happening. Dr. Harold Aspden
          is one such referee. Likewise, the presentation of the
          Correas' work on glow discharges written by the retired RCA
          engineer Mike Carrell - who visited the Correas' laboratory
          --- or the more recent testimonials of Mr. Uri Soudak,
          previously at Israeli Aircraft Industries, and of Dr. Eugene
          Mallove, editor of the journal Infinite Energy, on the subject
          of the 'Aether Motor' and their other technologies, constitute
          referee opinions. The same applies to the recent reflections
          on plasma discharges by William Tiller, Emeritus Professor at
          Stanford University - which Akronos Publishing has posted at
          its website. </p>
        <p align="left">The opinion put forth by Aspden --- whom Paulo
          regards as a mentor - is of particular interest to me because,
          on theoretical grounds alone, he had postulated the existence
          of 'over-unity energy generation' as far back as 1966. He now
          writes: "Suffice it to say that the apparatus uses the pulsed
          abnormal glow of a discharge tube', which, as physicists well
          know, has a negative resistance characteristic. What
          physicists have not appreciated, until this Correa disclosure,
          was the real possibility or the knowledge of precisely how to
          go about extracting 'free' energy by exciting self-sustaining
          oscillations in the plasma discharge. Undoubtedly, Dr.
          Correa's Labofex facility in Canada will have mustered a great
          deal of know-how from research on this project and we will
          hear more as that work comes to commercial fruition". These
          were good tidings indeed. </p>
        <p align="left">Much of the difficulty with this entire subject
          rests in the question: "Where does this mysterious energy come
          from?" Dr. Aspden had suggested that the ultimate origin of
          this energy may well be the 'vacuum energy' of space. Says he,
          "So now we are confronted with the Canadian breakthrough... I
          really believe that, after 30 years, the link between 'free
          energy' and gravitation is now emerging. Meanwhile, however,
          let us focus on the primary task of exploiting the new energy
          resource." </p>
        <p align="left">I have recently read the letter to the Correas
          by Dr. Eugene Mallove, and I was overwhelmed by it. We had
          been only partially aware of what we were seeing when visiting
          the Correa laboratory and witnessing their demonstration, but
          Mallove's letter brought it into strong relief for us. The
          letter he wrote was honest, detailed, full of clear memories
          of what he had seen and what it meant, and especially of its
          long-term significance and value. He was at the same time
          realistic about what its impact would be and the resistance to
          it, and he obviously cared. In an editorial, he wrote: "The
          discovery by the Correas is an amazing achievement: to have
          isolated a regime of self-oscillating electrical plasma
          discharge that produces electrical energy directly, with no
          intermediate thermal conversion step, is a wonder." </p>
        <p align="left">The Correas had set out with a careful critique
          of the present status of their field, discovered
          inconsistencies, set about to find the reasons for the
          inconsistencies, and used this information to build an
          internally consistent intellectual framework, designed tests
          of its integrity, and applied it to achieve successful
          demonstrations of its validity. Without being an expert in the
          field, I am able to see and appreciate the broad outlines of
          how they approach problems, what they are trying to do, and
          what they have succeeded in doing. </p>
        <p align="left">Overcoming obstacles was not foreign to the
          Correas, whether they were dealing with a stubborn,
          unyielding, mysterious Nature, unwilling to part with its
          secrets without exacting very high prices for them, both
          figuratively and literally, or in their interactions with
          interested but exploitative observers intent on taking
          advantage of their discoveries. </p>
        <p align="left">Despite all the exciting developments, however,
          money to commercialize these discoveries has not been
          forthcoming from anywhere. This has not been for lack of
          trying by the Correas, nor for lack of interest by potential
          backers. Many have come to them from all over the world and
          have seen striking demonstrations of the XS NRG<sup><font
              size="-2">TM</font></sup> PAGD reactor, the motors it
          drives and the batteries it charges, or of the Aether Motor
          developed at ABRI. These inventions are solidly protected by
          world patents. They are extensively documented in the patents
          themselves and recently on the Internet. Nevertheless, the
          Correas are, at the present time, in the process of shutting
          down their laboratory for lack of funds. </p>

          <font color="#000000">Anomalous cathode reaction forces
            varying in proportion to the square of the input current
            were first identified separately by Tanberg and Kobel, in
            1930, during studies of cathode vaporization in "vacuum"-arc
            discharges (VADs) and stationary cathode spots <b>(1,2)</b>.
            In his original paper, Tanberg made a case for the presence
            of longitudinal forces on electrodynamic interactions, which
            he attributed to the counterflow of vaporized cathode
            particles <b>(1)</b>, but K. Compton demonstrated that the
            vapor jet only accounted for &lt;2% of the reaction force's
            magnitude <b>(3)</b>. He suggested a different
            interpretation of the the electrodynamic anomaly, arguing
            for a mechanical rebound, at the cathode, of
            charge-neutralized gas ions that hit the cathode in the
            course of the discharge (bombardment rebound) <b>(3)</b>.</font></div>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">In the 1940's, little work
            was done on the North-American continent on the presence of
            longitudinal forces in plasma discharges. The notable
            exceptions <i>may</i> have been the self-funded research of
            W. Reich and of T.H. Moray. Reich claimed to have discovered
            a spontaneous pulsatory activity of the space medium in cold
            cathode diodes sealed at high vacuum, and to have achieved
            oscillatory frequencies that reached 30 Kc <b>(4)</b>. He
            equally claimed to have designed a motor circuit driven by
            the cyclic discharge in question, but all the details of the
            circuits were kept secret by Reich, and have remained so
            since the burning and banning of his publications by the FDA
            in 1956. His suspicious death in prison followed shortly
            thereafter in 1957. M.B. King <b>(5)</b> has suggested that
            anomalous lightning balls were produced in corona discharge
            tubes designed by T.H.Moray <b>(6)</b>, <i>possibly</i> by
            tuning the plasma diode to resonate with heavy ion acoustic
            oscillations <b>(7)</b>, but again the details are scanty.
            To our knowledge, <i>no one</i> has reproduced the vacuum
            experiments of Reich or Moray.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">German electromagnetic
            cannons were retrieved by the Combined Intelligence
            Objectives Sub-committee in 1945, which <i>reportedly</i>
            were capable of firing lightning balls into the atmosphere <b>(8)</b>,
            and Dr. H. Aspden has drawn our attention to the efforts of
            Kapitza, in Russia, to drive the formation of plasma balls
            in vacuum tubes with an RF source <b>(9)</b>. Kapitza
            apparently realized that the energy densities of lightning
            balls were of the magnitude required to initiate nuclear
            fusion. During the fifties, the US fusion program also
            investigated the suitability of utilizing anomalous reaction
            forces in exploding wires subject to high current surges and
            in 'axial pinch' voltage reactors, to create alternative
            neutron sources <b>(10)</b>.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Admission of longitudinal
            interactions has always been problematic for the
            relativistic law of Lorentz <b>(11)</b>, as well as for the
            Bio-Savart treatments of Ampere's Law <b>(12)</b>. Quantum
            treatments of (high) field-emission, such as the
            Fowler-Nordheim law (strong fields pull out electrons with
            low energies, ie Fermi electrons) <b>(13)</b>, also did not
            take these interactions into account.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Subsequent research in the
            1950's concentrated mainly on the study of cathode and anode
            spots, as well as on cathode erosion by crater formation <b>(14-15)</b>.
            Confirmation of Tanberg's longitudinal flow hypothesis would
            have to wait until the 1960's, but mass spectrometric
            studies carried out by several groups <b>(16-19)</b>
            indicated that the atomic particles involved were not
            neutral atoms, but mostly singly and multiply charged ions
            with energies exceeding the total VAD voltage. Measurements
            performed by Kimblin <b>(20-22)</b> of the fractional ion
            current supplied to the VAD, suggested a nearly invariant
            contribution in the order of 6 to 10% of the total VAD
            current. Combined with the detection of some neutral atom
            contributions to this anomalous reaction flow, these
            findings caused much initial resistance among arc
            physicists.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">By the 1960's, it had
            become apparent that the presence of tremendous
            electrodynamic forces acting longitudinally in the direction
            of the discharge could not be accounted for by the
            Lorentz/Bio-Savart Law. Moreover, as Plyutto et al remarked,
            the Tanberg vaporization hypothesis also could not explain
            the observed dependence of cathode reaction forces on gas
            pressure, nor the high velocity plasma streams emerging from
            the cathode <b>(18)</b>. Plyutto's model of an ambipolar
            mechanism, where the electrons sweep the ions forward as a
            function of the anomalous rise of potential in front of the
            cathode spot, while the spot moves backwards, may well
            explain the dynamic relation of these forces, but not their
            initiation mechanism.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">An understanding of the
            diverse experimental electrodynamic anomalies, and one that
            could unify disparate observations at that, would not be
            forthcoming however until 1969, when the Journal of the
            Franklin Institute published </font>Dr. H. Aspden'<font

        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">where m'/m is the ratio of
            positive ion mass to electron mass. Analyzing the
            proportionality of the current quadrature phenomenon
            observed by Tanberg and Kobel in copper and mercury VADs,
            Aspden contended that if one took into account the mass
            ratio between electric particles of different q/m ratios, an
            'out-of-balance' electrodynamic force would necessarily
            arise to act along the discharge path <b>(23)</b>. In 1977,
            Aspden would file a British patent application <b>(24)</b>
            utilizing thermal conversion of the high anomalous
            acceleration of cathode-directed ions by electrons in VAD
            plasmas <b>(25)</b>, but his circumstances did not permit
            him to pursue the work experimentally <b>(26)</b>. Aspden's
            patent for a VAD-based ion accelerator and associated energy
            transfer processes, utilizes advantageously the anomalous
            reaction forces developed during ion acceleration to design
            a thermoelectric generator that would release the "intrinsic
            energy" of the interaction, as well as a coupled
            cyclotron-type chamber (devoid of the characteristic D
            electrodes) for centrifugal acceleration of the released
            ions <b>(24)</b>.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Mounting evidence for
            longitudinal electrodynamic forces was then emerging from
            the study of relativistic electron beams <b>(27-28)</b>,
            high-frequency plasma spikes <b>(29-32)</b>, anomalous
            plasma heat transfer <b>(28, 33-34) </b>and anomalous
            discharge structures <b>(35)</b>. Three possible plasma
            instability mechanisms have been discussed in the literature
            for the explanation of the observed anomalous energy
            transfers, invoking magnetosonic waves <b>(35-36)</b>,
            ion-acoustic plasma instability modes <b>(37-38)</b> or the
            vacuum-field effect caused by the Zero-point energy (ZPE) <b>(39-45)</b>.
            More recently, others have suggested that these nonlinear
            interactions, such as the ion-acoustic plasma instabilities,
            high density abrupt electrical discharges, and
            microprotuberance field emission indicate the presence of
            resonant coherences with the ZPE <b>(46-47)</b>.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">However, all these
            phenomena were predictable from, and in agreement with,
            Aspden's Law - but this fact was simply ignored, even if the
            Lorentz's Law could not account for the experimental
            anomalies observed when a circuit was closed by distinct
            fluxes of charge carriers of <i>different mass</i>, while
            Aspden's Law effectively did. Particularly vexing to
            researchers, was the behaviour of cathodes in cold VADs and
            the emergence of the electron distribution required to
            satisfy ion production in the gas <b>(48)</b>.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Since the 1980's, Aspden's
            theoretical framework has received recognition <b>(49-53)</b>
            and direct or indirect experimental confirmation <b>(49-50,
              54-55)</b>. In the mid-eighties, Prof. P. Graneau and his
            group showed that electrodynamic explosions induced by
            kilovolt pulsed ion discharges in pure water were greater by
            three to four orders of magnitude than expected by
            established theory <b>(54-55)</b>. As Aspden pointed out,
            these results again should be understood in terms of the
            m'/m scaling factor <b>(56-57)</b>, but Graneau has
            rejected this explanation. Yet, Graneau's proposed model of
            the alpha-torque forces <b>(58-59)</b>, is not warranted by
            the findings of Pappas, which instead are consistent with
            Aspden's model of electrodynamic action <b>(49)</b>.</font>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">More recently still, G.
            Spence has patented an energy conversion system exploiting
            the electrodynamic mass ratio difference of electrons and

            a basic analogy with Aspden's patent <b>(24)</b>, but
            utilizing a different technique for the centripetal capture
            of the accelerated charge carriers, as based on a
            modification of the betatron principle that employs an
            homogeneous magnetic field <b>(60)</b>. Spence's device,
            however, suffered from periodic breakdown, usually after

            investigation of externally pulsed electrodynamic anomalies

            the Novosti Press Agency released news of Prof. A.
            Chernetskii's design of a plasma reactor that operated with

            the investigation of cathode reaction forces in parallel or
            coaxial electrode discharges that involve autoelectronic

            been termed the pseudospark discharge <b>(64-67)</b>.
            Because of the fast-switching on action of this discharge,

            Manuel, who coined the term Pulsed Abnormal Glow Discharge,
            did not employ auto-electronic 'field' emission to trigger
            the pulsation of the glow discharge - in fact he wanted to
            avoid it, and thereby avoid slippage of the externally
            pulsed AGD into a VAD regime- as he intended that only the

            Lewis-type or other bombardment engines, and MPD thrusters <b>(74-77)</b>),



            as well as in arc discharges (eg. arcjet engines <b>(78)</b>)
            this may be typically achieved by the advantageous

            vacua (10E-5 to 10E-7 Torr) and at low to medium voltages
            (10-50 kV DC). These events, which were associated with
            X-ray bursts, spontaneously originated localized cathode
            discharge jets that triggered the plasma glow in a fashion
            quite distinct from the flashing of a photocathode or from
            an externally pulsed plasma glow. It would soon become
            apparent that these discontinuities were elicited by
            spontaneous electronic emissions from the cathode under
            conditions of current saturation of the plasma glow, and
            could be triggered with much lower applied DC field
            strengths. The discharge was distinct from the VAD regime in
            that the plasma channel was self-starting,
            self-extinguishing, and the regime was pulsatory <b>(79)</b>.

            auto-electronic emissions from the cathode. What
            characterizes the functioning of the Correa reactors and
            differentiates them from all the foregoing arc emitter
            devices and the triggered pseudospark switches (PSS), as
            well as from Manuel's externally pulsed abnormal glow

            initiation as much as the method of its extinction. The
            discharge of interest is a pulsed abnormal glow discharge,
            but this pulsation is triggered autogenously at low applied
            field by a spontaneous electronic emission under
            cold-cathode conditions <b>(80-82)</b>. Furthermore, this

            pressure range, the magnitude of the input current, the
            large electrode gap distance, the nature of the residual
            gases and the cluster of electrode area effects discovered

            optimalize it (and its volt-ampere characteristic), the
            emission-triggered Pulsed Abnormal Glow Discharge, or
            autogenous PAGD for short. The PAGD regime is an homeostatic
            structure (a fluctuating order) of cyclically recurring
            discontinuities. Reactors designed to operate in the PAGD
            region of plasma discharge constitute effective plasma pulse
            generators with diverse applications <b>(85)</b>.</font> </p>

            electrodes, though they can be triggered inductively or
            "electrostatically" at prebreakdown potentials. They are in
            fact autogenous events where the observed emissions occur at
            low applied fields for quasi-regular periods, to generate
            quasi-regular cathode current jets. Unlike the PSS, which
            utilizes intermediate gap insulators to prevent the
            degeneration of the discharge into a full fledged VAD, the
            PAGD regime in the Correa reactors is self-extinguishing
            because of the inability of the discharge to complete the
            channel, as promoted by the synergism of the diverse
            physical parameters we have identified and analysed <b>(79-82,









              85)</b>. Whereas in the PSS switches the discharge channel
            is formed by the electrode holes or guides, the incomplete
            PAGD channel is free-forming.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The autogenous PAGD regime
            deploys extraordinarily large cathode reaction forces,

            striking the cathode and the anomalous ion counterflow
            (vaporized cathode metal and gas ions) being swept forward
            by the emitted electronic flux. The PAGD abnormal reaction
            forces depend on the intensity of the electronic-emission
            events that trigger the abnormal glow discharge, and are
            thus rather distinct from the externally pulsed,
            emission-independent abnormal glow discharges of the Manuel

            absent in externally pulsed flashover glow regimes, be they
            normal or abnormal.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">In comparison to VADs, the
            autogenous PAGD reaction forces also appear to be much
            greater. Whereas the particles leaving the cathode in the
            Tanberg VAD device had average kinetic energies in the order
            of 80 to 90 eV <b>(1,18)</b>, the particles forming the
            PAGD vortex have extraordinarily high energies that have
            been calculated to reach 0.5-&gt;1 MeV <b>(86-88)</b>! And
            they do so with typical power input consumptions that are
            lower by &gt;1 order of magnitude, with cathode fuel losses
            &lt;2 orders of magnitude and with vapor velocities &gt;100x
            those typically observed in VADs. Because of these
            characteristics of the emission-triggered PAGD, the regime
            transduces anomalous reaction forces that are 100x greater
            than those found in VADs <b>(82, 86, 88)</b>, in the range
            found by Graneau's group for arc-water explosions <b>(54-56,









              89)</b>. This extraordinary behavior is intimately related
            to the incompressible nature of the medium <b>(56) </b>in
            which the autogenous PAGD occurs, the ratio of the cathode
            ion mass to the electron mass <b>(26, 86, 90)</b>, and the
            nature of the plasma regime, particularly the PAGD
            extinction mechanism, which prevents the discharge from
            reaching a steady-state plasma generation <b>(91)</b>. In
            other words, the PAGD appears to obey precisely the tenets
            of Aspden's Law of Electrodynamics.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Given the self-pulsed
            characteristics of the autogenous PAGD regime, the pulse
            generator effectively functions as a simple DC inverter
            producing quasi regular large discontinuous "AC" pulses
            that, once filtered from the associated DC signal, can be
            directly utilized to power and control electromagnetic
            motors, relays and transformer circuits. This line of
            investigation culminated in the patented design of basic
            PAGD motor and other inverter circuits <b>(91-92)</b>. This
            was the origin of the Labofex Motor Drive (LMD) which
            utilizes innovative motor principles based upon a total
            control of the variables affecting PAGD production (applied
            voltage, applied current, residual gas nature, pressure,
            electrode area, reactive gap distance, electrode geometry,
            cathode work-function, etc) <b>(91-92)</b>. Similar
            applications would soon follow for transmission of the

        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Once we had isolated and
            optimalized this novel plasma discharge regime with respect
            to all of its parameters, we found that our measurement
            instruments indicated the deployment of discharge energies
            greatly exceeding the energy input responsible for the
            release of the charged carriers and the initiation of the
            discharge <b>(91,93)</b>. Through the coupling of a
            secondary circuit to the PAGD reactor, now made
            double-ported, we succeeded in capturing directly, as
            electrical power, the anomalous energy deployed by the ion
            discharge pulses at the cathode. This was the basis of the
            XS NRG (Excess Energy) Conversion System, a patent for which
            was granted to the authors by the USPTO in 1995 <b>(90)</b>.
            We had discovered that the PAGD-based abnormal cathode
            reaction forces could be used for the generation of power,
            if the excess energy that they deployed were electronically
            captured in a system effectively functioning as a power
            generator. Conversion of energy by creation of plasma
            instabilities with energies in excess of breakeven would
            thus result in the production of power. One arm of the
            closed system performs an entropic operation of loss of
            energy (this energy is spent in the injection of the pulse
            generator, to trigger its spontaneous plasma discharge),
            while the pulse output is then captured by a second arm. On
            the energy balance sheet, the energy accumulated in the
            second arm of the system consistently and substantially
            exceeds the energy lost by the first arm <b>(88, 90, 93)</b>.
            Like all known experimental energy-surplus generating
            processes, such as the thermonuclear fusion process or the
            Spence machine <b>(60)</b>, energy has to be spent for
            energy to be generated through the PAGD plasma regime.
            Unlike any other claim that we know of, for a machine
            capable of achieving breakeven conditions, the XS NRG
            results are reproducible and measurable. In other words,
            these are experimental results and not mere theoretical
            inferences. In fact, unlike many patents we have discussed
            above, our patents show explicit and extensive results for
            the operation of our energy converter system.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">In accordance with
            Aspden's treatment of the Law of electrodynamics <b>(23,
              56, 95, 97)</b>, our invention of the XS NRG Power
            Generation System is made possible by the engraftment of the
            extraordinarily large PAGD reaction forces transduced by
            distinct plasma flows, as a surplus of electric energy in
            closed charge systems. To borrow the language of Prigogine,
            these apparently closed systems give rise to self-organizing
            structures that are in fact transiently open physical
            systems, when they elicit anomalous reaction forces under
            specific conditions of performance. It is as if, through the
            auto-electronic metal/plasma interaction and the
            self-extinguishing characteristic of the PAGD regime,
            electrical power is directly squeezed out of metal 'in
            vacuo', by virtue of a pulsatory interaction with the
            polarized 'vacuum' field energy.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">It is possible that, as
            Aspden has suggested <b>(94)</b>, field polarization of the
            vacuum results in reversal of the cyclic motion of the local
            space lattice (the ZPE), the displacement of which, in turn,
            causes transient resonant vacuum-field states in the system.
            A closed system would thus behave as an open system, and it
            could systematically develop out-of-balance forces <b>(94-96)</b>.
            To paraphrase Aspden on this subject, it is the correct
            interpretation of Newtonian Dynamics and Newton's 'rule'
            that prevents us from ignoring the reacting field
            environment of electrodynamic interactions, all the more so,
            when these interactions develop mutual actions that appear
            to contravene Newton's Third Law <b>(97)</b>.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">In a speculative fashion,
            it is indeed interesting to remark that the PAGD energies
            associated with emitted cathode ions are in the range needed
            for electron-positron pair creation. Significantly, the
            study of narrow, nonrelativistic positron peaks and of
            electron-positron coincidences in heavy ion collisions has
            led to the identification of low-mass "photonium" resonances
            in the 1 to 2 MeV range (lowest prediction at ~1.2 MeV <b>(99)</b>),









            which have been theorized as possible e-e+ quasi-bound
            continuum states of a pure electromagnetic nature <b>(98-99)</b>,
            suggesting the existence of a new (ultra-nuclear and
            infra-atomic) scale for QED interactions <b>(99)</b>.
            Lastly, it has been formally shown that pair production can
            be supported by a photon field in a nonstationary medium and
            in a threshold-free manner (ie for any electromagnetic wave
            frequency) <b>(100)</b>.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">From the foregoing, the

            autogenous PAGD or IVAD functioning of the Correa reactors.
            In his US patent <b>(46)</b>, K. Shoulders describes an
            energy conversion system having some analogies with our own,
            in that he is able to generate microscopic coherent charge
            entities (which he terms EVs, for <i>electrum vallidum</i>)
            by a field emission process (utilizing Nothingham heating of
            point cathodes or pure field emission mechanisms). By
            external pulsing of the discharge field, he<i> theoretically</i>
            obtains energy outputs that are greater than the energy
            input spent in driving the system. Shoulders has invoked the
            Zero-point energy of the vacuum as an explanation for the
            coherent charge behaviour he has identified in his studies <b>(46)</b>.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">While the microscopic
            Shoulders' EV entities have minimal and maximal values of
            10E8 to 10E11 electron charges, and deploy energies in the
            order of 10E7 erg per triggered pulse, the macroscopic
            energetic events of the PAGD regime deploy 100-fold greater
            energies in the order of 10E9 erg per pulse <b>(86-87, 101)</b>.</font>

        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">It is rather likely that
            the out-of-balance reaction forces observed in the PAGD
            plasma reactors are the result of the interaction of the
            PAGD/IVAD apparatus with the local fluctuations of the
            dynamic vacuum-field. Such behaviour has been described by
            Aspden, for a dynamic zero-point field obeying the
            principles of Quantum ChromoDynamics <b>(94)</b>.</font> <font
            color="#000000">Aspden has put forth a model for aether spin

            and involving "inflow of kinetic energy in the aether
            itself"<b> (102)</b>. He has readily recognized the
            importance of pulsing the glow discharge and interrupting
            the autoelectronic emission, in the context of tapping the
            aether spin while denying return of the kinetic energy fed
            into field system back to the plenum. Aspden writes <b>(103)</b>:</font>

                by drawing power from the electrodes of the Correa tube.
                To do this, it is necessary to have pulsations and here
                there is an aspect which warrants theoretical research,

          <font color="#000000">The quantum mechanical treatment
            proposed by Fowler and Nordheim in 1928 <b>(13)</b> to
            explain arc initiation in terms of the pulling of electrons
            from metals by strong or high fields, has provided a
            scientific model for the discrete emission of electrons from
            the working cathode which, in this process, apparently
            violate the conservation laws, if just for an instant, and
            tunnel through the Fermi barrier. However, this quantum
            mechanical model never adequately accounted for the
            experimental evidence concerning arc initiation at fields
            and currents lower than those predicted, for arc discharges
            which present a Fowler-Nordheim slope. Nor does it account
            for operation of the Correa reactors in the autoelectronic
            emission-triggered low-field PAGD regime, where the
            experimental voltage-current characteristic is the inverse
            of that obeying the Fowler-Nordheim relation for high-field
            emission <b>(79-82)</b>. Rehabilitations of the
            Fowler-Nordheim treatment, where the theoretical enhancement
            factor has been explained in terms of breakdown produced by
            heating of cathode microprotuberances (Joule and Nottingham
            effects), have been proposed to explain the results of VAD
            studies <b>(15, 104)</b>, and these findings have been
            advantageously employed by Shoulders, in his design of point
            cathodes for field emission and for what he terms "pure
            field emission" <b>(46)</b>.</font></div>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">In distinction from
            quasi-thermionic field emission, the cold-cathode
            autoelectronic emission characteristic of the autogenous
            PAGD and IVADs appears to employ a different initiation
            mechanism, as it is facilitated by large cathode areas
            rather than points, under the appropriate conditions of
            work-function, pressure, input current, etc.</font> </p>

            effects, with the electrode area-dependent transient voltage
            instability of the glow discharge plasma recently reported
            in low power high-nitrogen/high-helium partial pressure CO2
            lasers, albeit that this lasing instability is non-periodic
            <b>(105-106)</b>. The periodic and current pulse aspects of
            the PAGD may in fact be what explains these nonperiodic
            lasing voltage spikes, in that their fortuitous occurrence
            probably stems from the PAGD threshold voltage-current
            characteristics: at low input currents, the auto-electronic
            PAGD emission is a rare event<b>(79-82, 91)</b>. At these

        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The anomalous PAGD cathode

            the cyclic plasma instability that develops tremendous field
            reactions in the nonstationary vacuum gap. Independently
            from whether the PAGD singularities result from capture of
            some of the immense reservoir of energy priming the vacuum <b>(107-108)</b>
            or from some other unknown mechanism, cathode spot formation
            involves a net expenditure of the cathode metal per event,

            commutation of interrupted "vacuum"-arc discharges (IVAD)

            resulted from this ongoing effort. Utilization of IVADs in
            the XS NRG Converter System has several mixed advantages:
            larger input currents are possible (which the
            voltage-current characteristic of the PAGD precludes) with
            IVADs than with the PAGD, resulting, under the necessary
            conditions of operation, in still larger emission
            catastrophes; separation of the potential switch function

          <font color="#000000">Fig. 1 is an idealized plot of the
            potential (on a linear but arbitrary voltage scale) between
            the principal electrodes of a vacuum discharge tube with
            increasing current (on a logarithmic scale in amperes).
            Curve A, below its intersection with curve B at point E,
            represents a typical relationship between current and
            voltage for cold cathode discharges, including
            auto-electronic emissions, whilst curve B represents a
            typical relationship for thermionic glow discharges,
            including thermionic emissions. The high-current
            intersection of the two curves at point E represents a
            transition into the vacuum arc discharge (VAD) region (curve
            C) with the establishment of a continuous low resistance
            plasma channel between the electrodes. With increasing
            current from very low levels, curve A presents an initially
            rising voltage or "positive resistance" characteristic,
            through the Townsend discharge (TD) region, a flat
            characteristic through the constant discharge (CD) region, a
            falling voltage or "negative resistance" characteristic
            through the transitional region discharge (TRD) and normal
            glow discharge (NGD) regions, to a minimum, before once
            again rising to a peak at F and then falling to an even
            lower minimum, equal to the sustaining voltage for a vacuum
            arc discharge, through the abnormal glow discharge (AGD)
            region. The rising potential over the first portion of the
            AGD region is believed occasioned by saturation of the
            electrodes by the glow discharge, which causes the potential
            to rise until auto-electronic emission sets in allowing the
            potential to fall again as the current rises further. In
            practice, the increasing interelectrode potential following
            saturation, and other factors such as electrode heating,
            leading to thermionic emission, will tend in conventional
            tubes to result in a premature transition from the AGD into
            the VAD regime, following a curve similar to curve D shown
            in Fig. 1.</font><br>
          <p><b>Figure 1</b></p>
        </div>
        <p align="left"><font color="#000000">Essentially, the
            autogenous PAGD regime relies on the use of gas discharge
            tubes designed to avoid premature transition from the NGD to
            the VAD regimes, and capable of being operated in a stable
            manner in that region of the characteristic curve of Figure
            1 extending between points E and F, within the AGD region.
            The peak F that characterizes the abnormal discharge region
            means that as the applied current is increased linearly
            within this region, the resistance of the 'vacuum' medium in
            the tube first increases with increasing current, only to
            subsequently decrease, still with increasing applied
            current, down to the minimum resistance value corresponding
            to the sustaining potential of a "vacuum" arc. Expressed in
            terms of resistance characteristics, the autogenous PAGD
            regime spans, as a function of applied current, a subregion
            in which a positive resistance characteristic changes into a
            leading negative resistance characteristic. The pulsed
            regime of the AGD is only sustainable when the intensity of
            the applied current is greater than that needed to rapidly
            saturate the plates, but not so great as to set up a VAD.</font>

          <p align="left"><b>Abstract ~</b> A direct current power
            transducer for driving alternating current devices utilizes
            a discharge tube connected across a current source, the
            construction of the tube and characteristics of the source
            being such as to maintain endogenous pulsed abnormal gas
            discharge within the tube. The tube is capacitatively
            coupled to an external load including an alternating current
            device, typically an electric motor. Electric motors of the
            asynchronous induction or synchronous types are particularly
            suitable, but other alternating current devices may be used.
            By adjustments to the current source, the capacitance in
            parallel with the discharge tube, and connections to
            auxiliary electrodes, the pulse repetition frequency of the
            discharge may be adjusted, thus allowing variable speed
            control of types of alternating current motor not normally
            amenable to such control. </p>

          <p align="left">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
          <p align="left">1. Field of the Invention </p>
          <p align="left">This invention relates to a high power gas
            discharge tube of novel characteristics, and to applications
            of the tube in the control of electric motors and other
            alternating current devices. </p>
          <p align="left">2. Review of the Art </p>
          <p align="left">As the current passed through a gas discharge
            tube is increased beyond the levels at which normal glow
            discharge takes place, such normal gas discharge being
            characterized by a negative resistance characteristic
            leading to decreasing potential between the cathode and
            anode electrodes of the tube, a region of abnormal glow
            discharge is entered in which the negative resistance
            characteristic changes to a positive resistance
            characteristic leading to increasing potential between the
            electrodes. Typically this increased potential rapidly leads
            to breakdown into vacuum arc discharge between the
            electrodes, again characterized by a negative resistance
            characteristic. Accordingly, gas discharge tubes have been
            operated in the normal glow discharge or vacuum arc regimes
            in which stable operation can be achieved by suitable
            ballasting of the tube, the former regime being suitable for
            low current applications and the latter for high current. It
            is possible to utilize a normal glow discharge tube in a low
            frequency oscillator circuit by placing capacitance in
            parallel with the tube and in series with the ballast
            because such a tube is characterized by a comparatively high
            striking potential at which discharge is initiated, and a
            lower but still high extinction potential at which discharge
            ceases. Operation in such a mode with vacuum arc devices is
            difficult because, in order to turn off the device
            effectively, the arc must be extinguished or otherwise
            interrupted or divested for long enough to disperse the
            intense ionization formed in its path. </p>
          <p align="left">Devices operating in the vacuum arc regime
            have other problems, particularly in terms of ensuring
            adequate electrode life, which have led to gas diodes and
            triodes (thyratrons) being superseded by semiconductor
            devices in most applications. A further limitation of such
            devices is that the great difficulty in turning them off,
            except by terminating current flow through the device for a
            finite period, limits their usefulness as control devices to
            rectification, current turn-on and low frequency alternating
            current applications. </p>
          <p align="left">The only prior art of which we are aware which
            successfully exploits the abnormal glow discharge regime is
            the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,316 (Manuel)
            issued Oct. 7, 1969, which we understand is commercially
            utilized in forming organic coatings on metal cans. It
            relies on the application of externally generated current
            pulses to force a discharge tube temporarily into the
            abnormal glow discharge region, the pulses being
            sufficiently short that no vacuum arc is established. There
            is no disclosure of any endogenous pulsed abnormal glow
            discharge, the apparatus is dependent upon an external pulse
            generator to operate, and its utility is completely
            different from the present invention because it uses
            externally generated pulses rather than generating such
            pulses. </p>
          <p align="left">We are also aware that the use of vacuum arc
            discharge tubes has been proposed for the control of
            inverters, as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 4,194,239
            (Jayaram et al), which discloses the use of vacuum arc
            discharge tubes in which the discharge is steered
            magnetically between multiple electrodes to provide a
            commutating effect. Such an arrangement acknowledges the
            difficulty of extinguishing a vacuum arc, and seeks to
            overcome the difficulty by instead switching the discharge
            between electrodes by the use of externally applied magnetic
            fields. </p>
          <p align="left">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
          <p align="left">The problems associated with the operation of
            vacuum arc devices are typically associated with the
            establishment of a continuous channel of low resistance
            ionized plasma between the electrodes of a device operating
            in this mode, typically accompanied by intense heating of
            the electrodes. Such a channel is difficult to interrupt in
            rapid and predictable manner once established. The pulsed
            abnormal glow discharge regime is characterized by no such
            continuous channel having been established, and
            predominantly cold-cathode auto-electronic emission rather
            than thermionic emission, these characteristics provide the
            ability to extinguish the discharge readily. </p>
          <p align="left">We have found that, by suitable design of a
            low pressure gas discharge tube, we can sufficiently inhibit
            transition from the abnormal glow discharge regime into the
            vacuum arc discharge regime that we can successfully exploit
            characteristics of the abnormal glow discharge regime to
            provide a device having valuable and controllable
            characteristics as a high power, pulse generator when fed
            from a current source. Such a pulse generator has useful
            applications in for example motor control and other
            applications requiring high current pulses. It is a valuable
            characteristic that the pulse repetition frequency can be
            varied over a range, the extent of which itself varies
            according to the physical characteristics of the tube and
            the environment in which it is operated. According to
            circumstances, the frequency may range as low as 10 pulses
            per second or range as high as 10.sup.4 pulses, these
            figures being exemplary only and not limitative. </p>
          <p align="left">The purpose of the present invention is to
            provide a means to operate alternating current machines, and
            in particular to derive useful electromechanical work from
            any vacuum discharge tube capable of sustaining a stable
            pulsed abnormal glow discharge (PAGD). The present invention
            provides a simple circuit having at least two parallel arms:
            a pulse generator arm containing the vacuum discharge and an
            electromechanical arm which transduces electrical pulses
            into mechanical energy. In the latter, the electromechanical
            device is integrated into a reactive load presenting a
            capacitance in parallel with the tube. The present invention
            was specially devised to work with specific cold cathode
            vacuum tube pulse generators as disclosed in the parent
            application, using either diode or triode connections, but
            the circuitry can be made to work with any suitable vacuum
            device capable of being operated in an endogenous pulsed
            abnormal glow discharge regime under cold cathode
            conditions. </p>
          <p align="left">The advantage of using a spontaneous emission
            self-pulsing device such as that described in the parent
            application lies in the fact that the speed of an AC motor
            and its torque can be varied directly by altering any of the
            parameters that affect pulse frequency as described in that
            application. Two of these parameters, parallel capacitance
            and applied, constant direct current, are of particular
            usefulness, since when all other parameters are the same,
            the rate of pulsed abnormal glow discharge, controlling
            motor speed and torque, can be made to vary as a function of
            increasing current applied to the cold cathode device, for
            any given discharge capacitance employed. This yields an
            extremely simple method of motor speed control, particularly
            suited to drive synchronous and induction AC motors from a
            starting DC supply, but also generally applicable to any
            motor, whether rotary or linear, whose speed or rate is
            dependent upon the frequency of a pulsed or alternating
            current. Rather than placing an alternating current machine
            directly in the circuit containing the discharge tube, it
            may be connected indirectly through a transformer or
            synchro-transmitter system. </p>

          <p align="left">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
          <p align="left">Throughout the following detailed description,
            the same reference numbers are used to denote identical
            elements present in more than one Figure. </p>
          <p align="left">The context of the invention in terms of
            vacuum discharge phenomena will first be discussed with
            reference to FIGS. 1 and 2. Referring to FIG. 1, which plots
            the potential between the principal electrodes of a vacuum
            discharge tube with increasing current, potential being
            shown on a linear but arbitrary scale of voltage, and
            current on a logarithmic scale in amperes, curve A, below
            its intersection with curve B, represents a typical
            relationship between current and voltage for cold cathode
            discharges, including auto-electronic emissions, whilst
            curve B represents a typical relationship for thermionic
            glow discharges, including thermionic emissions. The
            high-current intersection of the two curves at point E
            represents a transition into the vacuum arc discharge (VAD)
            region (curve C) with the establishment of a continuous low
            resistance plasma channel between the electrodes. </p>
          <p align="left">It will be noted that curve A exhibits, with
            increasing current from very low levels, an initially rising
            voltage or "positive resistance" characteristic, through the
            Townsend discharge (TD) region, a flat characteristic
            through the constant discharge (CD) region, a falling
            voltage or "negative resistance" characteristic through the
            transitional region discharge (TRD) and normal glow
            discharge (NGD) regions, to a minimum, before once again
            rising to a peak of F and then falling to an even lower
            minimum, equal to the sustaining voltage for a vacuum arc
            discharge, through the abnormal glow discharge (AGD) region.
            The rising potential over the first portion of the AGD
            region is believed occasioned by saturation of the
            electrodes by the glow discharge, which causes the potential
            to rise until autoelectronic emission sets in allowing the
            potential to fall again as the current rises further. In
            practice, the increasing interelectrode potential following
            saturation, and other factors such as electrode heating,
            leading to thermionic emission, will tend in conventional
            tubes to result in a premature transition from the AGD into
            the VAD regime, following a curve similar to curve D shown
            in FIG. 1. </p>
          <p align="left">The present invention relies on the use of gas
            discharge tubes designed to avoid premature transition from
            the AGD to the VAD regimes, and capable of being operated in
            a stable manner in that region of the characteristic curve
            of FIG. 1 extending between points E and F. Referring now to
            FIG. 2, which plots test results for just such a tube,
            constructed as described below with reference to FIG. 18 and
            19, and shows, again on similar coordinates to FIG. 1
            (except that the potential units are defined), the
            extinction or sustaining potentials of the tube (the same
            information as plotted in FIG. 1), together with the
            breakdown potential (i.e. the potential required to initiate
            the autoelectronic discharge). It will be noted that the
            breakdown curve shows two discontinuous portions X and Y,
            corresponding to the vacuum arc and abnormal glow discharge
            regimes respectively. The intersection of curve X, and curve
            Z representing the sustaining or extinction potential is
            illustrative of the difficulties inherent in extinguishing a
            vacuum arc discharge, since a decrease in current is
            accompanied by a decrease in breakdown voltage until it
            equals the VAD sustaining voltage which does not vary
            greatly in this region. On the other hand, the combination
            of a fairly high and constant breakdown voltage (curve Y)
            combined with an extinction potential which rises with
            decreasing current in the region E-F (see FIG. 1) of the
            pulsed abnormal glow discharge regime means that the pulsed
            abnormal glow discharge will be extinguished if the current
            source during the tube operation ceases to be able to
            sustain the increasing current required to maintain the
            discharge as the potential between its electrodes drops, at
            some current below the intersection of curves X and Z. </p>
          <p align="left">If the effective internal resistance of the
            source is above some critical level, then as the current
            through the tube rises, the proportion of the source
            potential developed across the tube will fall until it
            intersects the curve Z at a current below the intersection
            with curve X, at which point the abnormal glow discharge
            will self extinguish, and the current flow through the tube
            will drop abruptly until the current through the tube
            combined with the potential between its electrodes again
            intersects the curve A in FIG. 1. This permits
            reestablishment of a rising current through the tube
            traversing the abnormal glow discharge region as the
            potential across the tube rises to the peak F and then again
            falls to a point short of E. Accordingly, under these
            circumstances, a pulsed abnormal glow discharge will be
            exhibited, accompanied by high amplitude current pulses
            through the tube. It should be understood that the curves of
            FIG. 1 are indicative of the static behaviour of a nominal
            discharge tube under particular current and voltage
            conditions, and are not fully indicative of the behaviour of
            the tube under dynamic conditions in which tube current and
            inter-electrode potential vary with time, nor with changes
            of the many other factors which may influence tube
            behaviour. In particular, the plasma effects generated in
            various phases of tube operation require finite time to
            form, reform or dissipate as the case may be, and in the
            case presently under consideration this time factor,
            combined with time constants of the external circuit in
            which the tube is placed, are determinative of the pulse
            frequency of the discharge. </p>
          <p align="left">The definition of any regime of electrical
            discharge in a vacuum is usually presented as dependent upon
            the major operational parameter being considered, i.e. upon
            the variation of direct current passing between the primary
            electrodes. For a given optimal vacuum (which must
            necessarily be less than perfect) all gas electrical
            discharge regimes can be presented as dependent upon this
            parameter. FIG. 1 is such a presentation and the peak that
            characterizes the abnormal discharge region means that
            within this region, as the applied current is increased
            linearly, the resistance of the vacuous medium in the tube
            first increases with increasing current, only to
            subsequently decrease, still with increasing applied
            current, down to the minimum resistance value corresponding
            to the sustaining potential of a "vacuum" arc (which is
            somewhat above the ionization potential of the gas, or in
            fact of the metal vapour, in the enclosure). As the
            transition from a normal glow discharge into a vacuum arc
            discharge is made either directly (in thermionic devices) or
            indirectly, in cold-cathode conditions, via an abnormal glow
            discharge that may be more or less precipitous, it is only
            in the ideal diode and the ideal vacuum that both linear
            functions (corresponding to the regimes that have a
            sustaining potential) and nonlinear functions (corresponding
            to the transition regions, such as the TRD and the AGD)
            appear to depend exclusively upon the input current. In
            fact, many factors affect the AGD, foremost amongst them,
            pressure, plate distance and plate area. Hence the peak in
            the curve of FIG. 1 is an idealized view of events. </p>
          <p align="left">This said, we are left with the experimental
            observations and what they tell us. In this respect,
            auto-electronic emissions characteristic of the pulsed
            abnormal gas discharge (PAGD) regime can be seen to emerge
            from the NGD, as the current is increased beyond the point
            when the cathode glow has reached plate saturation (if the
            current is not too low and the plate area not too large). </p>
          <p align="left">The same effect occurs when the pressure is
            reduced and the current is kept constant at a suitable level
            (neither too high nor too low, exact figures depending on
            other factors such as gap distance and plate area, etc.). </p>
          <p align="left">If the current is increased further, in either
            case, the PAGD regime fully emerges (in other words, in
            pumpdown tests, the applied current also has to be
            sufficient). In this regime the plate is not so much
            saturated with a negative glow (which remains, but is
            attenuated), but exhibits local concentrations of the plasma
            that arise in a given area of the cathode as a function of
            the auto-electronic emission mechanism. If the applied
            current is increased in steps, a stage is reached at which
            the extinction potential of the PAGD falls until it meets
            the minimum potential of an arc discharge, as demonstrated
            in FIG. 2. With reference to FIG. 1, this means that the
            current-dependent variation of the PAGD in these devices
            passes from a high to a low extinction potential or from a
            high to a low electrical resistivity of the medium, and is
            thus localized on the descending slope of the peak in FIG.
            1. Expressed in terms of resistance characteristics, the
            regime of the pulsed abnormal glow discharge spans, as a
            function of applied current, a subregion in which a positive
            resistance characteristic changes into a leading negative
            resistance characteristic. The pulsed regime of the AGD is
            only sustainable when the intensity of the applied current
            is greater than that needed to rapidly saturate the plates
            (but not so great as to set up VAD), the result being
            development of auto-electronic emission with its associated
            inverted cone-like discharge and a residual, faint glow of
            the entire cathode (rather than a saturated NGD). </p>
          <p align="left">Each PAGD cycle begins as a singular emission
            and performs a cycle of functions whose electrical
            characteristics vary accordingly with time. During a
            charging process (which eventually leads to emission), the
            plate potential rises to a maximum at F (see FIG. 1), while
            being limited by the maximum virtual value of the applied
            current. Any substantial increase in the applied current is
            blocked by the insulating properties of the intervening
            medium (as if a very large resistance characterized the
            device); in the discharge process, beginning with the
            initiation of auto-electronic emission at F, conditions for
            conduction across the (operational) vacuum are established
            and, as a consequence, the resistance characteristic of the
            device becomes increasingly negative until the extinction
            potential is reached, at which point the glow discharge
            ceases. This endogenous on/off behaviour is exactly what
            characterizes the PAGD cycle. </p>
          <p align="left">Two boundary conditions arise. In the first
            case, the available current is not quite enough to sustain
            the PAGD. In this instance, full escape from the NGD regime
            and the characteristics associated with its sustaining
            potential will not occur, while any heating of the cathode
            will eventually lead to the establishment of a
            semi-thermionic cathode glow. In the second instance, there
            is a risk of degeneration into a thermionic NGD or a VAD if
            the available current is too high or sustained too long.
            This degeneration will set in during the second phase of the
            PAGD unit cycle, and may lower the resistance of the device
            to the point of constant conduction of current across the
            vacuum; the result is that the auto-electronic emission is
            not quenched, as spontaneously happens in the PAGD.
            Thereafter, extinction of the resulting VAD, which may be
            promoted by a variety of factors is an unpredictable event;
            if the current is available, the arc will burn for as long
            as there is energy supplied and as long as there is cathode
            material available to consume. A VAD in no way resembles a
            regular, cyclic oscillator, which is the outstanding aspect
            of the PAGD. Whilst an arc discharge is, like the PAGD, an
            auto-electronic emission phenomenon characterized by
            intermittences (the apparent constancy of an arc is the
            result of the high frequency of these intermittences), such
            an arc does not exhibit the regular or quasi-regular
            cyclical nature of the PAGD, nor its inherent current
            limiting characteristics. </p>
          <p align="left">In order that a stable pulsed abnormal glow
            discharge (PAGD) as discussed above may be obtained, the
            discharge to be utilized must be capable of repeated
            excursions into the region E to F of FIG. 1. This entails
            that the tube be constructed so that, as the tube operates
            and the current through it rises, the potential across the
            tube can reach the peak F in FIG. 1 and beyond, without the
            abnormal glow discharge degenerating into a vacuum arc
            discharge. This will be influenced, among other factors, by
            the extent of thermionic emission from the cathode which
            will itself be influenced by resistive heating of the
            electrodes and their work function, as well as by their
            separation and configuration, and the nature and pressure of
            gas within the tube, as well as the presence of auxiliary
            electrodes or probes. The influence of these various factors
            is extensively exemplified below, with reference to the
            description associated with FIGS. 18 to 24b, which
            description; discloses tubes capable of sustaining PAGD.
            Whilst the present invention is described with reference to
            its use in connection with such tubes, it should be
            understood that the invention may be implemented utilizing
            any tube capable of sustaining a stable PAGD discharge
            whether or not disclosed in our earlier application. </p>

            with the principles set forth in FIG. 18 to 24b and their
            associated description. Motors with other characteristics,
            such as single phase capacitor-start induction motors,
            two-value (start and run) capacitor induction motors,
            repulsion-induction motors, repulsion-start induction-run
            motors, reluctance motors, universal motors, split phase
            motors, two-phase induction or synchronous motors (wired as
            single phase capacitor-run motors), or single phase rotor
            input synchro-transformer generators could also be connected
            to the same terminals 13a and 13a. </p>
          <p align="left">As shown in FIG. 3, the voltage source may be
            either a line-fed DC power supply 1 (preferably constant
            current), a DC generator 2 or a battery pack 3. For best
            results, one of the latter two should be employed because
            line-fed supplies will contain other parallel circuitry,
            including an internal bypass capacitance and, unless they
            are very well regulated, will leak alternating current from
            the line which may influence the pulse rate or stability of
            the PAGD discharge. The supply voltage and current may be
            controlled by using methods known to those skilled in the
            art, whichever source is used. With line fed power supplies
            it is preferred to control the DC output by varying the
            power input using the autotransformer method. With a DC
            generator, the power output can be controlled directly by
            varying the speed of the generator. With a battery, simple
            control of input direct current and output pulse frequency
            from vacuum device 7 is best achieved with a variable series
            resistor 4. Diodes 5 and 6 prevent transients from the pulse
            discharge from reaching the DC source. </p>
          <p align="left">The discharge tube 7 is shown in FIG. 3
            connected in a diode configuration with cathode 8 placed
            between rectifier 5 and capacitor 10 and the anode 9 placed
            between rectifier 6 and capacitor 11, by virtue of a switch
            22 being turned off (position NC). When switch 22 is turned
            to position 13a' so that an axial member or probe 12 within
            the tube is connected to the terminal 13a, the pulse
            frequency increases by an amount depending on the parameters
            of the circuit as a whole. In this configuration, the axial
            member of the pulse generator functions as a plasma excitor
            member, as it lowers the potential and increases the rate of
            discharge by adding its spontaneous emissions to those of
            the cathode. The same result obtains when switch 22 connects
            axial member 12 to position 13e' instead, thus joining it to
            terminal 13e. </p>
          <p align="left">The capacitors 10 and 11 are placed in
            parallel with the reactive electrodes, with the motor 14 in
            series between capacitors 10 and 11, but in parallel with
            either the plates (diode configuration) or the axial member
            and the cathode or anode (triode configurations) as the case
            may be. For best results, it is desirable to have
            capacitances 10 and 11 disposed symmetrically in the circuit
            as shown in FIG. 3. An unbalanced circuit results when one
            capacitor is absent, and anode counter-emissions become
            frequent. Capacitance values for discharge capacitors 10 and
            11 are determined as a function of the type of vacuum pulse
            device employed and the nature and performance
            characteristics of the AC motor 14 chosen. If the
            capacitances are too small, the motor will not start nor
            maintain rotation; if too large, the motor will not turn
            smoothly or continuously, and spontaneous anode
            counter-emissions may occur which will break the rotation of
            the motor by reversing the direction of the electromagnetic
            flux. The critical parameter is the total series value of
            the capacitance placed in parallel with the pulse generating
            device, and there is no need for the capacitances 10 and 11
            to be identical; in fact it is preferred that there be a
            higher capacitance on the side of the cathode (capacitance
            10) than on the anode side (capacitance 11) when the triode
            configuration has the axial excitor member connected to 13a
            via switch 22 at position 13a', or the reverse when the
            axial member is connected to 13e. </p>
          <p align="left">The AC motor employed may, in general, be of
            any type. Split phase, single phase, or two phase AC motors,
            be they universal, induction or synchronous types, having
            squirrel-cage, wound-type, eddy current, drag cup or
            hysteresis-type rotors, will all respond to the pulses
            generated in this circuit. Single phase, permanent-split
            capacitor, AC induction motors having squirrel-cage rotors
            and single phase AC synchronous hysteresis capacitor motors
            are preferred. The latter, in particular, have the advantage
            of developing a nearly uniform torque from stationary or
            blocked rotor positions to synchronous speed as well as
            producing a smoother response to the pulsating nature of
            single phase power (e.g. in a 60 Hz circuit, power is in
            fact delivered in pulses at 120 Hz) than that of other
            single phase motors. The motor 14 in FIG. 3 has its main
            winding coil 15 in parallel with the discharge tube and an
            auxiliary coil 16 connected in parallel with the main coil
            15 via the phase capacitor 17. This corresponds to the
            connection as a single phase AC permanent-split capacitor
            motor. To reverse the direction of the motor it is
            sufficient to switch the position of switch 18 from pole 19
            to pole 20. If motor 14 were a suitable two phase AC
            induction or synchronous motor wired as a permanent-split
            capacitor single phase motor, then the reversal obtained by
            switching 18 would provide an equal torque in either
            direction of rotor rotation of the motor. A less efficient
            start-up or phase displacement utilizes a resistance in
            place of capacitor 17, in a manner known in the art. The
            resistance may be varied to alter the motor speed. </p>
          <p align="left">Replacement of pulse generator 7 by a suitable
            vacuum device, as diverse as a fluorescent light bulb (as a
            diode) or a deuterium triode indicates that, despite the
            absence of desirable physical parameters identified in the
            parent application, any cold cathode operated vacuum tube
            device capable of endogenous pulsed abnormal glow discharges
            through spontaneous autoelectronic cathode emissions when
            operated in the abnormal glow discharge region, is capable
            of serving as the pulse-forming discharge tube in the
            circuit. By contrast, whilst discharge tubes operating in
            the normal glow discharge region can be used to form pulse
            generators, the mechanism is different and the power output
            would generally be too low to be useful in an
            electromechanical application. </p>
          <p align="left">Any inductive AC electromechanical device such
            as a relay solenoid or linear motor, may also be employed in
            place of motor 14 at terminals 13a and 13e, FIG. 3, to
            derive electromechanical work from the on and off switching
            action of the vacuum discharge tube 7 when operated in the
            abnormal glow discharge region. </p>
          <p align="left">An advantage of the invention is that a
            constant current supply coupled to a suitable vacuum
            discharge tube can be used to obtain smooth rotary action
            from certain AC motors in an easily controllable fashion,
            without having recourse to a conventional inverter system in
            order to produce alternating current, and provides a simple
            means of frequency control. Whereas the main limitation
            imposed on the use of induction or synchronous AC motors is
            that they are essentially constant speed motors which can
            only vary their torque as a function of the magnitude of the
            AC voltage and current input (given that the frequency of
            the power supply cannot normally be changed), the present
            invention allows the torque and speed of an AC motor to be
            controlled by varying the DC voltage and current applied to
            any cold cathode vacuum device 7 operated in the pulsed
            abnormal glow discharge regime as discussed above, as well
            as by varying the pulse rate of the vacuum discharge by
            other means such as through the probe 12 in a device as
            described in the parent application. Furthermore, the
            electromechanical force is developed from a nearly even
            sequence of discontinuous energy bursts, of controllable
            frequency, rather than continuous sinusoidal power pulses at
            a fixed frequency. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 4 shows how two single phase
            permanent-split capacitor AC motors 14a and 14b may be
            connected symmetrically in tandem, both placed in parallel
            with a single vacuum discharge tube 7, following the
            principles described above for FIG. 3. Independently of
            whether the axial member 12 is or is not connected to
            junction 13b, a capacitor 21 may be advantageously
            introduced between junctions 13b and junction 13c, to even
            out the rotation of the two motors, although it is not
            essential. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 5 shows how two (or more) discharge tubes
            may be connected in series to drive two or more motors 14a
            and 14b also in tandem, from the output of two or more
            vacuum devices 7 placed in series with each other.
            Connections 13a' and 13d' from axial members 12a and 12b, as
            well as capacitor 11 and its connection to 13b may be
            omitted and the circuit will still function. The circuit of
            FIG. 5 will produce a pulse sequence at the output from the
            second tube which is phase shifted with respect to that of
            the first tube, with further shifting as more tubes are
            added. It is thus possible to couple multi-phase motors as
            shown in FIG. 6, (showing a two phase motor) with a suitable
            capacitance 21 being introduced between junction 13b and
            junction 13c to control further the firing rate of the
            second vacuum device 7b. The addition of more tubes in
            series will further displace the phase of the pulse
            sequences in each successive device. Sufficient relative
            angular displacement of two tube-generated pulse sequences
            can also be achieved by introducing a suitable delay relay
            between points 23 and 24, at the cathode input to the second
            vacuum device. </p>
          <p align="left">In general, the pulse frequency developed by a
            discharge tube operated to produce PAGD in the circuits
            described will depend on several factors: some are circuit
            factors, such as the total discharge capacitance placed in
            parallel with the vacuum device, and the characteristics of
            the power supply (direct current and voltage values); others
            are physical factors, such as the pressure, the chemical
            nature of the gas fill and the field-emission work function
            of the cathode material and its composition and still others
            are geometrical or dimensional in nature, such as the
            interelectrode distance, the plate area and the parallel
            plate arrangement. All these factors are discussed in the
            parent application. </p>
          <p align="left">The following examples relate to tests of the
            circuit of FIG. 3. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 1 </p>
          <p align="left">The circuit of FIG. 3 was tested with a single
            phase squirrel cage induction motor, the capacitor 17 being
            2 .mu.Fd. The RPM of the rotor was measured with a
            stroboscopic tachometer to determine how it varied with the
            total series value of the external capacitances 10 and 11
            (FIG. 3) placed in the electromechanical arm of the circuit,
            in parallel with the anode and the cathode of a discharge
            tube constructed as described with reference to FIG. 18,
            with 64 cm.sup.2 plate area, 5.5 cm interelectrode distance
            and an air fill at 2 Torr. The tube was excited in a triode
            configuration (switch 22 at position 13a' and switch 18 at
            position 19, FIG. 3) by an AC line-fed DC power supply. The
            results are shown in FIG. 7. Provided that the capacitance
            is not too high or too low, other factors such as the
            frequency of the pulses generated by the vacuum device
            (which increases with decreasing parallel capacitance) and
            the type and characteristics of the windings and of the
            rotor of the motor employed, have a greater influence on the
            motor speed. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 2 </p>
          <p align="left">The total value (internal to the power supply
            and external to it) of the capacitance placed in parallel
            with the discharge tube in the same triode configuration of
            the previous Example, in turn affects the maximum frequency
            of abnormal glow discharge pulses produced, and the
            effective synchronous motor RPM, as shown in FIG. 8. This
            figure presents motor RPM as a function of the total series
            value of the external capacitances placed in the
            electromechanical arm of the circuit, and shows results
            obtained with a single phase hysteresis capacitor motor
            (rated as 110 VAC 1/10 Hp, with the auxiliary winding motor
            capacitance 17 having a value of 2.4 microfarad). These
            tests indicate that for any given AC motor there will be
            optimal values for the pulse rate produced by the discharge
            tube, and that this pulse rate will have a maximum value for
            any particular value of the total capacitance placed in
            parallel with the pulse generator, and specifically in the
            electromechanical arm of the circuit, and this capacitance
            itself will have an optimal value. Conversely, for any given
            motor characteristics, a pulse generator can be designed
            with optimized circuit or electrical, physical and
            geometrical parameters. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 3 </p>
          <p align="left">With a rope-and-pulley type of torque meter,
            the rotor-blocked torque developed by a synchronous
            hysteresis motor was tested using the circuit of FIG. 3, and
            the same vacuum device as the previous two Examples. This
            type of motor was chosen because in an "ideal hysteresis"
            motor, the torque developed is constant at all speeds from
            standstill to synchronicity, locked rotor, pull-in and pull
            out torques being identical. Even though a single-phase
            capacitor-type hysteresis motor departs more from the ideal
            curve than a polyphase hysteresis motor does, on account of
            the elliptically shaped rotating fields set up by a
            capacitor motor, most manufacturers make permanent-split
            capacitor single phase hysteresis motors with identical
            full-load and locked rotor torques. We have utilized one
            such motor for our tests. FIG. 9 illustrates the range and
            mean of at least nine tests conducted at each of three
            different input direct currents into the pulse generator,
            the extinction voltage remaining relatively constant at
            about 330 VDC, with the results expressed as standstill
            torque developed related to the pulse rate of the pulse
            generator. The discharge tube was triode connected as
            described with reference to FIG. 3, and the total series
            value of the external parallel capacitance to the pulse
            generator was 36.6 microfarads. It is readily apparent that
            the torque developed is proportional to the pulse frequency
            as is desirable for the purposes of the present invention.
            The torque developed is also proportional to the voltage
            input into the motor (i.e. the tube output voltage) as is
            exemplified in FIG. 10, where tests of the PAGD-induced
            torque (closed squares) obtained and measured under the same
            conditions described for FIG. 10, over the frequency range
            of 11 to 45 PPS, are compared with tests of an AC 60 Hz line
            sine wave generated torque (shaded circles), as a function
            of the input volts into the motor from each source. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 4 </p>
          <p align="left">An example of the relationship of operational
            parameters involved in the performance of the circuit of
            FIG. 3 is shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, using the same pulse
            generator device employed in the previous Examples 1 through
            3 at an air pressure of 1.75 Torr, and using the same
            hysteresis motor as described in the previous Examples 2 and
            3. The tests of FIGS. 11 and 12 utilized a total series
            capacitance for the external electromechanical arm of 7.9
            .mu.fd (with reference to FIG. 3: capacitor 10 = 440 .mu.fd,
            capacitor 11=8 .mu.fd)). The same triode circuit was
            employed as in previous examples. FIG. 11 illustrates how
            the discharge rate of the pulse generator is controlled by
            the steep increase in applied DC amperes (open squares)
            while DC volts (closed squares) decrease to a near plateau
            as the pulse frequency reaches 40 pulse per second. Total
            wattage input to the discharge tube in the PAGD regime, at
            the output from the transformer secondary of the DC power
            supply, is shown in shaded squares. FIG. 12 shows the
            corresponding pulse output from the vacuum tube into the
            motor arm of the circuit and illustrates how the AC rms
            current (open squares), the AC rms voltage (open circles),
            the true and apparent power (respectively, closed and shaded
            circles) as well as the rpm of the synchronous hysteresis
            motor increase proportionately to the discharge rate of the
            pulse generator. With reference to FIG. 3, the effect of the
            connection to the axial member 12 through the switch 22 is
            to promote, other conditions being equal, an increase in
            discharge frequency: at these tube input and output
            parameters changing from a diode to a triode configuration
            typically increases the maximum discharge rate from 30 to
            43-45 PPS. </p>
          <p align="left">With the triode configuration and all other
            conditions being unchanged, the effect of a larger total
            series capacitance value placed in parallel with the pulse
            generator, in the electromechanical arm of the circuit, is
            to limit the maximum pulse rate of the PAGD and the related
            motor parameters, as illustrated by FIG. 8. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 5 </p>
          <p align="left">When a motor is wired as a single phase motor
            and connected to an adjustable frequency power source, the
            voltage applied to the motor stator terminals should change
            proportionately to the change in frequency in order to
            maintain the constant air-gap flux that permits the motor to
            develop its rated torque over its speed range. A provision
            is thus desirably made in the power source not only to
            maintain a volts to pulse rate relationship which is
            relatively constant over an operating range, but also to
            maintain it at a value suited to the motor. In the present
            invention this is easily accomplished by adjusting the total
            series capacitance in the electromechanical arm of the
            circuit to the set value of the operating motor for any
            given input frequency range. Two such examples of volts per
            pulse per second curves as a function of PAGD frequency at
            the motor input are shown in FIG. 13, one (shaded circles)
            obtained with a squirrel cage induction motor (110 VAC, 1/20
            Hp, 2 mfd auxiliary winding capacitance) and the other (open

            Examples 2 through 4. Total series capacitance values for
            the parallel electromechanical arm of the circuit were
            respectively 3 and 8 mfd. In both instances shown, the volts
            per cycle value tends to become a constant with increasing
            frequency, reaching a plateau at around 25 PPS. </p>
          <p align="left">In some instances, it may be appropriate to
            incorporate a discharge tube operating in the PAGD regime in
            an inverter circuit so that the pulse output may be utilized
            by a remotely located alternating current device. The
            intermittency of the pulses produced by the arrangements
            described above are not conducive to efficient operation of
            conventional transformers, and a push-pull circuit
            arrangement is preferred. While such an arrangement could
            utilize two discharge tubes, an advantageous arrangement
            utilizes a single tube of the type described in the parent
            application, as shown in FIG. 14. In this instance, both
            plates 8a and 8b of the tube act as cathodes and are
            connected to the diode 5, and the probe or auxiliary
            electrode, which is typically of tungsten, acts as a common
            anode 9 and is connected to the diode 6. The capacitors 10a
            and 10b are connected to opposite ends of a centre-tapped
            primary winding of a transformer 26, providing an
            alternating circuit output through a secondary winding. The
            centre-tap of the primary winding is connected to the
            electrode 9. The two halves of the primary winding
            inductively couple the cathode circuits in antiphase, thus
            synchronising the PAGD pulse trains involving the two
            cathodes in antiphase. </p>
          <p align="left">In a modification of the circuit shown in FIG.
            15, the capacitors 10a and 10b are connected directly to the
            electrode 9, and the primary of the transformer 26 is
            connected directly between the two cathodes with its centre
            tap connected to the diode 5. Whilst this arrangement bears
            some superficial resemblance to known inverter circuits
            employing VAD devices, it should be noted that the circuit
            is completely self-commutating, and does not need moving
            external magnetic fields to provide commutation as in the
            prior art. </p>
          <p align="left">It should be understood that, using a suitable
            three or more phase transformer, and a vacuum discharge tube
            with three or more cathodes (or three or more discharge
            tubes), a higher pulse rate or a multiphase output may be
            obtained from the transformer. It should also be understood
            that, as shown in FIG. 16, in some applications it may be
            advantageous to strap the plates 8a and 8b in parallel as
            cathodes 8a and 8b and use the auxiliary electrode as an
            anode 9, in a circuit similar to that shown in FIG. 3, the
            tube being operated either in diode mode as shown, or in
            triode mode utilizing an additional auxiliary electrode. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 17 shows a modification of the circuit of
            FIG. 3. When the switch at node 13a is in position 25, it
            provides pulses only to the rotor R2 of a self-synchronous
            (selsyn) unit 27 in a synchro-transmitter system, in which a
            three phase output of the unit 27 is utilized per se, or
            transmitted to three phase windings of a second, slave unit
            28, the windings of whose rotor R3 is closed through an
            external short circuit or load. Whilst rotation of the rotor
            R2 will provide synchronous rotation of the rotor R3 in
            well-known fashion, it may be advantageous to place the
            switch in position 24 to connect the motor 14, and to link
            its rotor R1 to the rotor R2 to provide this rotation, thus
            in turn providing remotely a corresponding rotation of rotor
            R3. </p>
          <p align="left">FIGS. 18, 19a and 19b of the drawings
            illustrate the construction geometry of discharge tubes
            which may be utilized as pulse generators such as shown in
            FIGS. 24a and 24b and in implementing the invention. The
            discharge tubes are assembled using accepted techniques
            which are well known to those skilled in the art of vacuum
            tube technology. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 18 shows a pulse generator, generally
            referred to by reference 50, having a cylindrical housing 52
            which is preferably a glass material. Depending on the
            interelectrode spacing of the pulse generator, which in
            accordance with the invention may range from about 3 cm to
            about 20 cm or more, the glass housing 52 is preferably
            Pyrex.TM. or #7740 borosilicate (Corning, N.Y.). Such
            cylindrical housings 52 are commonly available in diameters
            of about 6 to about 11 cm and a variable thickness of about
            0.2 to about 0.3 cm. Other borosilicate glass, quartz glass
            or ceramic housings can be employed as suitable alternatives
            to Pyrex glass and in sizes outside these commonly available
            ranges. </p>
          <p align="left">The pulse generator 50 further includes two
            parallel, spaced-apart electrodes comprising a cathode 54
            and an anode 56, hereinafter often collectively referred to
            as "plates" for brevity and convenience. As noted above, the
            anode and cathode in pulse generators according to the
            invention are spaced 3 to 20 cm or more apart. The cathode
            54 and the anode 56 may be either flat or curved and are
            preferably made of 0.5 to 2.0 mm thick aluminum, nickel or
            nickel alloy. The thickness of the cathode 54 and the anode
            56 is not critical and any thickness within a reasonable
            range apparent to those skilled in the art may be used. The
            surface areas of the cathode 54 and the anode 56 are
            preferably quite large in comparison to the surface area of
            an anode/cathode in prior art vacuum tube devices. Surface
            areas which range from 16 to 256 cm.sup.2 have been tested,
            as described in the examples hereinafter. Although the scope
            of the invention is not believed to be limited by this range
            of surface area of values, it was generally observed that
            the larger the surface area of the anode/cathode tested, the
            more readily the pulse generator 50 elicited PAGD discharges
            providing other conditions such as plate material, vacuum,
            residual gas fill, voltage and current remained constant. </p>
          <p align="left">The preferred material for the cathode 54 and
            the anode 56 is aluminum. Two specific types of aluminum are
            preferred; namely, H34 rolled aluminum available from the
            Alcan Company and Alzak.TM. aluminum available from the
            Alcoa Company. Other types of aluminum are assumed to
            constitute suitable material for cathode 54 and anode 56.
            Aluminum is a preferred material because of its low work
            function for field emission as well as for its other
            qualities such as relative freedom from sputtering, except
            when subjected to vacuum arc discharges, and its electrical
            conductivity. In all instances, the aluminum used for
            cathode 54 and anode 56 were degreased and rinsed in
            accordance with published methods familiar to those skilled
            in the art. </p>
          <p align="left">Each of the cathode 54 and anode 56 is
            suspended within housing 52 by a support member 58 which
            passes through hermetic seal 60 an opposite sides of the
            housing 52. The support members 58 are preferably rigid rods
            of substantially pure tungsten in a diameter of 1/16 th to
            3/32 nd of an inch, or any suitable diameter. The material
            of choice is round finished PureTung.TM. available from
            Union Carbide. </p>
          <p align="left">The pulse generator 50 also includes at least
            one axial probe 62 and the pulse generator 50 shown in FIG.
            18 has a tetrode geometry with two spaced-apart axial probes
            62. Substantially pure tungsten rod is also the preferred
            material for constructing the axial probe(s). All tungsten
            rods used in assembling pulse generators in accordance with
            the invention were repeatedly cleaned with sodium nitrate
            and fused with a beaded sleeve of uranium glass #3320
            available from the Corning Company or nonex.TM. glass #7720.
            These glasses are graded seals designed for high vacuum
            tungsten/pyrex junctions. Before the metal components of the
            pulse generator 50 are introduced into the glass housing 52,
            the housing is annealed at a temperature of 565.degree. C.
            After the pulse generator was assembled, it was connected by
            a glass constriction tube to the glass manifold of a vacuum
            system (not illustrated). </p>
          <p align="left">An alternative geometry for a pulse generator
            in accordance with the invention includes a
            parallelepiped-shaped housing which is assembled using a
            suitable plastic polymer sheet. Polymer housings are
            preferably made from polycarbonate, specifically Lexan.TM.
            available from the General Electric Company. Especially
            preferred are the ultraviolet resistant Margard.TM.
            surface-treated Lexan.TM. MR5 or superior grades. The joints
            of the rectangular panels are preferably sealed with either
            a low vapour pressure resin Torr Seal.TM. available from the
            Varian Corporation which is applied along the mating edges
            to glue the panels or alternatively, an epoxy putty such as
            LePage's or MR Carbone's Handworkable Putty is first layered
            over the joints and then covered with translucent
            Scotch-Weld epoxy resin 2216B/A available from the 3M
            Company or another adhesive system suitable for withstanding
            the implosive forces of very high vacuum. For very large
            housings the walls are also preferably screwed together at
            spaced-apart intervals. Non-metallic internal braces can
            also be used to reinforce very large housings. The
            polycarbonate housings are cleaned as per manufacturer's
            instructions and all metal to polymer support interfaces,
            such as the hermetic seals where electrodes and probe(s)
            pass through a side wall of the parallelepiped-shaped
            housing are preferably epoxy resin joints made with Torr
            Seal.TM.. The vacuum constriction for connecting the housing
            to a vacuum pump is made of glass which is also joined to
            the polycarbonate surface using the Torr Seal.TM. epoxy
            resin. This alternative construction of pulse generator has
            a triode geometry which includes a single axial probe made
            of substantially pure tungsten rod. In all other respects it
            is the same as the pulse generator 50 described with
            reference to FIG. 18. </p>
          <p align="left">FIGS. 19a and 19b show transverse
            cross-sections of preferred constructions of pulse
            generators in accordance with the invention. FIG. 19a
            illustrates a cylindrical housing 52 with a flat plate anode
            56 and cathode 54. As shown in FIG. 19b, the anode 56 and
            the cathode 54 may be elongated, transversely curved
            sections which are substantially semi-cylindrical in shape.
            This anode/cathode geometry is actually preferred for
            cylindrical housings. The curved electrodes may be made from
            laser quality reflective aluminum foil about 200 microns in
            thickness. Such electrodes have a current tolerance of
            approximately 100 mA of direct current in the PAGD regime
            and are destroyed by disruptive slippage into arc discharge
            with as little as 900 watts of applied power. Curved
            electrodes of press-formed aluminum plate are therefore
            preferred over curved electrodes made from aluminum foil. </p>
          <p align="left">The following examples of tests conducted with
            discharge tubes 50 used as pulse generators illustrate the
            character and performance of such pulse generators. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 6 </p>
          <p align="left">Volt-ampere Characteristics of a Pulse
            Generator </p>
          <p align="left">The tests described in this example were
            conducted with a pulse generator 50 (device #1) constructed
            with H34 aluminum flat plates (128 cm.sup.2 area) set 5 cm
            apart, and equidistantly from a continuous axial probe 62 in
            a vacuum which measured 10.sup.-6 Torr at time of seal off.
            FIG. 2, already discussed above, shows that under conditions
            of a positive, constant DC voltage applied to the anode 56
            of this device, the volt-ampere curve for both breakdown
            potential (Vb, shown as open squares) and for the minimum
            discharge potentials (Vs, or VAD sustaining potential and
            Vx, or extinction PAGD potential, both shown as closed
            circles) disclose two regions or regimes in the operation of
            this device, a region of pulsed AGD which spanned from about
            10 mA to about 150 mA RMS (with an applied maximum of 15 mA
            DC average), and a region of VAD at RMS current values
            greater than 250 mA. PAGD current data was derived from peak
            pulse RMS values and VAD RMS current data was obtained at
            steady-state. Within the range of the pulsed AGD, the Vb
            values were high and plateaued at about 850 volts; Vb values
            for the VAD regime were generally lower than those of the
            PAGD and could be raised by an increase in available
            current. </p>
          <p align="left">A PAGD regime could also be equally identified
            when the supplied DC voltage was negative and applied to the
            same cathode plate 54 (see FIG. 18), for both PAGD and VAD,
            Vb and Vx values (closed and open squares, respectively) at
            comparable transduced pulse RMS currents. Utilizing a
            10-fold higher direct current power supply, also
            earth-grounded at the centertap but having a parallel supply
            capacitance of 55 mfd and a slow voltage recovery rate (ie.
            less than 200 V/sec), the same pulse generator 50 (device
            #1) yielded 10.times. higher peak PAGD RMS currents (2 A vs.
            200 mA) than were obtained under the same conditions and
            with the same power supply by a positive applied voltage of
            equal magnitude. These findings suggest that, at high
            applied direct currents, there is a strong asymmetric
            response of the pulse generators 50 (larger PAGD RMS current
            values with cathodic tension than with comparable anodic
            tension) with respect to the sign of the plate polarization
            in reference to earth-ground. </p>
          <p align="left">It is also apparent that the field emission
            responsible for the PAGD regime does not obey the
            Fowler-Nordheim VAD region law (see FIG. 20): whereas the
            VAD graph has the expected negative slope, the slope of the
            PAGD graph is positive, contrary to predictions by the
            Fowler-Nordheim VAD region law. This constitutes strong
            evidence for the existence of auto-electronic emission
            discharges that do not obey the behaviour predicted by the
            Fowler-Nordheim field-emission theory, the discharges
            occurring at much lower currents than predicted by that
            theory. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 7 </p>
          <p align="left">Pulse Count Rates in the PAGD Region </p>
          <p align="left">Two pulse count studies were done: a first at
            low applied direct currents (&lt;1.5 mA) and a second at mid
            to high applied direct currents (1.5 mA to 200 mA). Peak
            pulse RMS currents during the second study were as high as 2
            A. </p>
          <p align="left">At low currents, using the pulse generator 50
            (device #1) assembled with H34 aluminum plates and ballasted
            with a 1 Mohm resistor and a lower pulse amplitude detection
            cut-off at less than 25V, the pulse per minute counts at the
            axial probe were observed to increase as the anode-supplied
            voltage (and the current, not illustrated), was incremented
            from 300 V to 500 V. At higher voltages the pulse count
            plateaued at a somewhat depressed level. Conversely,
            utilizing a pulse generator (device #2) assembled with Alzak
            plates in an identical vacuum at seal off (10.sup.-6 Torr),
            the pulse counts increased with applied voltage up to a
            maximum voltage applied, the maximum pulse count being about
            9 times higher than observed with device #1. Reducing the
            ballast resistance increased the pulse rate of device #1 to
            a maximum of 1000 pps, or 60,000 PPM with a 0.125 ohm
            resistor, and increased the pulse rate of device #2 to 4000
            pps or 240,000 PPM. Analysis of the pulse signals with an
            oscilloscope showed that, in both instances, the observed
            CPM values at the axial probe 62 effectively corresponded
            (about 1:1) to the PPM values at the cathode 54, under these
            conditions for both devices #1 and #2. </p>
          <p align="left">At currents higher than 1.5 mA, when the PAGD
            regime is fully active, the inverse phenomenon was observed:
            i.e. the pulse rates increased with a decrease in the value
            of the extinction voltage (Vx). They also increased
            proportionally to the transduced pulse RMS current. This was
            observed for both positive and negative polarizations of the
            `vacuum`, with pulse generator 50 (device #1) Under these
            conditions and with a 1 Mohm ballast resistor, rates of
            113-124 pps were measured, the limiting factor being the
            recovery time of the voltage regulation of the power supply
            as the current drain increased. This phenomenon was
            exaggerated when no ballast was employed and the largest
            peak pulse currents were observed. With faster recovery
            power supplies capable of delivering the same or higher
            input currents (and having the same large value of
            capacitance in parallel with the plates) much higher pulse
            rates (greater than 1,000 pps) could be obtained, along with
            larger peak pulse RMS currents. </p>

            Generator as a Function of Decreasing Pressure </p>
          <p align="left">Argon pumpdown tests were conducted to
            determine whether and when the PAGD region of the discharge
            was apparent utilizing comparably low voltages (up to 2.5
            kv). These tests were performed with both the diffusion pump
            off and on. FIG. 21 shows a typical curve of the variation
            of the sustaining/extinction voltages at the plates with
            decreasing pressure at the rotary pump, from breakdown (at
            860 VDC) to glow extinction, for all four pulse generators
            50 examined (device #'s 3 to 6), which were assembled with
            H34 aluminum plates having different electrode areas: device
            #3, 16 cm.sup.2 (small closed squares); device #4, 64
            cm.sup.2 (open circles); device #5, 128 cm.sup.2 (open
            squares); device #6, 128 cm.sup.2 (large closed squares).
            Each pulse generator 50 had the same gap distance of 5.5 cm
            and was assembled with the same volume of glass envelope.
            Devices #3 to 5 were evacuated simultaneously and an
            identical average direct current of 1 mA was applied to each
            separately, using comparable power supplies ballasted with a
            1 Mohm resistor. Device #6 was evacuated in a separate test,
            under the same pumpdown conditions and at the same applied
            potential of 860 VDC at breakdown, but was subjected to a
            100-fold higher, average direct current of 500 mA. It is
            readily apparent that the continuously varying,
            sustaining/extinction voltage curves shown in FIG. 21 are
            analogous to the Paschen gas breakdown voltage curve
            and&nbsp; that throughout most of the voltage range all
            three low current curves are parallel. Independent
            determinations of the low current breakdown voltage curves
            for all three pulse generators 50 (devices #3 to 5) showed
            the exact same relation for all three curves as observed for
            the sustaining/extinction voltage curves (results not
            shown). The differences between the electrical discharge
            regimes observed as a function of decreasing pressure are
            most apparent in the larger plate area pulse generator 50
            (device #5). The three regions of the discharge, the
            transitional glow, the normal glow and the pulsed abnormal
            glow, are clearly distinguishable for that device (see FIG.
            21). In the transitional region discharge (TRD), the cathode
            glow is of minimal point-like size and rapid oscillations of
            the striations of the plasma positive column originate
            quasi-sinusoidal, dampened sinusoids, ramp-like or
            noise-like waveforms associated with sporadic, small
            amplitude (2 to 15 volts), pulsed auto-electronic emissions.
            In this region the voltage tends to fall, while oscillating
            erratically at first. As the pressure further decreases,
            there follows a stable normal glow discharge (NGD) region,
            where conduction of different current across the vacuum
            pre-empts the possibility of auto-electronic emission the
            lowest voltages are observed in this region. After the
            recession of the positive column and upon glow saturation of
            the plate areas, just as the cathode glow is beginning to
            recede (pre-Cooke's `post-cathodic` phase), the intense,
            large amplitude (&gt;100 V), pulsed auto-electronic emission
            characteristic of the PAGD regime emerges. In this region,
            the voltage tends to climb until extinction occurs before
            the maximum voltage of 860 V is again attained. In the other
            two devices, the borders of the discharge regimes are
            blurred. In device #3, the low emissions intensity, small
            amplitude auto-electronic develop into a few high intensity,
            large amplitude emissions, as they decrease in frequency and
            with considerable overlap; the PAGD and NGD regimes are also
            mostly mixed, until lower pressures of the order of 0.01
            Torr are attained, at which point the PAGD regime functions
            alone at low frequency. In device #4, the NGD regime can be
            better distinguished from the TRD, and the PAGD from the
            NGD, but high intensity, large amplitude auto-electronic
            emissions occur early on in the NGD region as the glow
            saturates the plates faster than for device #5. There is a
            dual effect on increasing the average applied direct current
            100-fold (device #6, large closed squares, shown in FIG.
            21): the entire ascending arm of the voltage curve is
            displaced upward in the pressure scale and the distribution
            of the voltage variation is compressed. The high applied
            direct current also abrogates the two discharge regions
            adjacent to the PAGD. From breakdown to extinction, the
            regime of the discharge is solely that of the PAGD, the
            positive column of the discharge weakening with the
            decreasing pressure. However, if the cathode is hot enough,
            a quasi-thermionic `post-cathodic` glow may also briefly
            occur after the PAGD regime and before glow extinction. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 22 shows the pulse rates for the observed
            intense large amplitude, auto-electronic emissions
            characteristic of the PAGD regime, which correspond to the
            voltage curves for devices #3 to 5 obtained above as
            described for FIG. 21. In all three devices, the PAGD regime
            first appeared mixed together with the NGD regime in the
            form of pulses that perturbed the steady-state glow, the
            pulses increasing in frequency with the decreasing pressure
            until a maximum pulse rate was attained. </p>
          <p align="left">In FIG. 23, the effect on the PAGD regime of
            increasing the current 500-fold (from 1 to 500 mA), while
            keeping the potential constant using the same 128 cm.sup.2
            plate area pulse generator 50 (device #6) during two other
            separate evacuations with the rotary pump, is shown. The
            higher current displaces the PAGD region upward in the
            pressure scale, just as was observed in the ascending arm of
            the voltage curve (see FIG. 21). The displacement inducted
            by the applied high current occurs over a pressure range
            where, at low current (1 mA) and with the same applied
            potential at breakdown, some weak, low-amplitude, pulsed
            auto-electronic emissions are observed during the TRD. </p>
          <p align="left">The effect of increasing the starting DC
            voltage at breakdown by 1.75-fold (from 860 to 1507 VDC) was
            observed using device #3 in two separate tests. The
            increased current displaced the PAGD upper pressure limit
            downward in the pressure scale, in opposition to the current
            effect and it also increased the frequency of the intense,
            large amplitude, auto-electronic emissions by a factor of
            about 8.8. </p>
          <p align="left">Using the same applied low direct current and
            potential magnitude at breakdown (860 VDC) described for the
            tests represented in FIGS. 21 and 22, pumpdown of the three
            different plate area pulse generators 50 (each having
            interelectrode distances of 5.5 cm) was performed with the
            oil diffusion pump on. While the effect of increasing the
            plate area under these conditions remained the same, i.e.
            lowering the pressure for the same sustaining/extinction
            potential and displacing the PAGD region to regions of
            higher vacuum, there was a noticeable difference compared
            with the same test done with the rotary pumpdown: i.e. the
            extinction pressure was greatly extended downward in the
            pressure scale for all devices, and, consequently, the PAGD
            region was greatly expanded into the medium to high vacuum
            ranges. A 128 cm.sup.2 plate area pulse generator 50 with
            5.5 cm gap, (devices #11 and 12) typically reached PAGD
            extinction at 5*10.sup.-5 Torr, though its peak pulse rate
            remained basically unchanged. This overall displacement of
            the PAGD phenomenon to higher vacuum regions under
            conditions of oil diffusion evacuation may well be due to
            the migration of very low vapour pressure oil molecules to
            the tube ends (despite the baffle and the cooling trap) and
            their interaction with residual gas molecules in the
            electrical field of the devices. With the diffusion pump on
            and voltages progressively increasing up to 2.5 kV with
            decreasing pressure, the PAGD regimes in these pulse
            generators 50 operated from 10.sup.-3 to 10.sup.-5 Torr.
            Typically a 128 cm.sup.2 H34 aluminum plate pulse generator
            50 (5.5 cm gap) will operate in the PAGD regime at
            2*10.sup.-5 Torr, with an applied voltage of 2.2 kV and at a
            pulse rate of 30 pps. With higher vacua (&lt;10.sup.-5 Torr)
            and voltages, the `post-cathodic` PAGD gives way to the
            production of cathode rays and very weak x-rays. From
            several such diffusion pumpdown tests it was concluded that
            the PAGD was facilitated by the use of Alzak electrode
            material and, as it will be shown in Example 9, by larger
            plate areas. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 9 </p>
          <p align="left">The Effect of the Plate Area on the PAGD
            Characteristics during Pumpdown </p>
          <p align="left">The effect of increasing the plate area of the
            cathode 54 and anode 56 of a pulse generator 50 was tested
            by two methods: 1) using a pumpdown method of varying the
            vacuum with a rotary pump (as explained below) and 2) using
            sealed housings 52, 64 enclosing a vacuum of 2*10.sup.-6
            Torr obtained with the diffusion pump (see Example 10). </p>
          <p align="left">The results from the first test is shown in
            FIGS. 21 and 22, for the pulse generators 50 stimulated with
            low (1 mA) direct currents, at the same starting potential
            of 860 VDC at breakdown. A comparison indicates that the
            effect of increasing the plate area in pulse generators 50
            having the same gap distance, and thus the same pd value
            (pressure, in Torr, multiplied by interelectrode gap
            distance, in cm), and the same volume, is to depress the
            voltage, particularly in the NGD and PAGD regions and to
            displace the auto-electronic pulsed emission characteristic
            of the PAGD regime to a higher vacuum range. The peak
            frequency of PAGD for each given area is also attained, in
            each case, at a vacuum that increases proportionately to the
            order of increasing area (16.fwdarw.64.fwdarw.128 cm.sup.2)
            as does the magnitude of the peak frequency of PAGD for a
            given gap distance. The distribution of PAGD frequencies
            also narrows its characteristic mode with the larger area
            plates, by displacing an upper pressure limit to lower
            pressure regions, the most significant shift in this respect
            being from the 64 to the 128 cm.sup.2 devices (FIG. 12, open
            circles vs. open squares). This distribution compression
            shift corresponds to a better definition between the NGD and
            the PAGD regimes afforded by the pulse generator 50 with the
            largest plate area employed (128 cm.sup.2), as discussed
            above in Example 8. Moreover, in accordance with Paschen's
            law, the observed area-dependent voltage reduction effect
            cannot be explained, inasmuch as the voltage is predicted to
            remain the same as long as the product pd is constant even
            if the plate area increases. Since the interelectrode gap
            distance was constant for all devices and as the pumpdown
            was also performed simultaneously, it is apparent that there
            is an electrode plate area effect which is not accounted for
            by Paschen's law. The observed plate area effect appeared to
            have an effect opposite to current and in the same direction
            of increasing potential, as it displaced the PAGD region
            downward in the pressure scale and increased the PAGD
            frequency. In addition, an increase in area also reduces the
            magnitude of the potential. From the results obtained, it is
            apparent that an increase of 1.75 fold for a given breakdown
            potential of a 16 cm.sup.2 pulse generator yields the same
            pulse rate (about 60 pps) as does an 8 fold increase in
            plate area for the same volume housing (52, 64), but
            requires a lower pressure. </p>
          <p align="left">A comparison of breakdown order and pressure,
            as well as of peak pps values and peak pps conditions
            carried out as a function of plate area for the pulse
            generators 50 (devices #'3 to 5) represented in FIGS. 21 and
            22, showed that the pulse generator 50 with the largest
            plate area, which was the first to undergo breakdown (during
            six separate tests) at the highest pressure of 3 Torr,
            yields an 8 fold higher PAGD rate than the pulse generator
            50 with the smallest plate area of 16 cm.sup.2, at the
            lowest pressure (the pressure is 24 times lower than that of
            the 16 cm.sup.2 device). This peak pps rate occurs, however,
            at a voltage which is about 9.5% greater for the pulse
            generator 50 with the largest plate area. These results
            suggest that a larger plate area promotes breakdown at
            higher pressures (i.e. the breakdown pressure decreases
            inversely to the order of increasing plate area) and
            supports lower sustaining/extinction voltages. </p>
          <p align="left">In conclusion, the effect of increasing the
            plate area of pulse generators stimulated with the same
            starting voltage and the same current is to: 1) shift the
            breakdown pressure upwards, 2) depress the working voltage,
            3) increase the pulse rate both in the TRD and the PAGD
            regions, 4) shift the PAGD region downwards in the pressure
            scale and segregate the discharge regimes more clearly as a
            function of decreasing pressure. These observations also
            explain why the pulse generators with smaller plate area
            shift the PAGD up in the pressure scale, as an increase in
            current does. Effectively, a smaller plate area not only
            concentrates the lines of electrostatic force in a vacuum,
            but it also increases the current density per unit area,
            with the consequent glow saturation of the plates, necessary
            for the abnormal glow discharge region to be attached,
            occurring earlier on during pumpdown, than for pulse
            generators with larger plate areas. </p>

            Characteristics of Pulse Generators Enclosing a High Vacuum

          <p align="left">The second method used to test the effect of
            increasing the electrode plate area in the design of a pulse
            generator 50 made use of glass housings 52 enclosing a final
            vacuum of 2*10.sup.-6 Torr obtained with a diffusion pump
            on. These tests were performed with high direct currents
            (200 mA to 1 A). All pulse generators tested (devices #'s 7
            to 13) had an interelectrode gap distance of 5 cm, enclosed
            the same volume and the same vacuum, and were assembled at
            H34 aluminum plates having plate areas which varied by an
            area factor of k.sub.A =2, namely: 64, 128 and 256 cm.sup.2.
            Originally the test was performed with a series with a
            k.sub.A = 2.sup.2 factor, the plate areas being described by
            2.sup.4, 2.sup.6, 2.sup.8 or 16, 64 and 256 cm.sup.2.
            However, at a seal off vacuum of 2*10.sup.-6, the first two
            pulse generators 50 of this series (16 and 64 cm.sup.2,
            devices #'s 7 to 10) remained unresponsive (no signs of
            discharge). Even when 3.3 kV was applied, one of the 64
            cm.sup.2 pulse generators showed only a faint glow (also see
            discussion of results for groups #1 and #4 of Table 5
            below). The results for the k.sub.A =2 series indicate that
            when the current, the interelectrode distance and the
            pressure are all kept constant, the breakdown potential (Vb)
            for the PAGD decreases with an increase in plate area. For
            the largest plate area tested (256 cm.sup.2), the PAGD
            breakdown (287 V) and extinction (Vx=284 V) voltages
            practically coincide, suggesting that larger areas might
            depress both Vb and Vx still further. These results were
            recorded under identical conditions of applied direct
            current (200 mA), of peak pulse RMS current and of pulse
            frequency (20 pps) using an earth-grounded centertap power
            supply with both positive and negative voltages applied
            simultaneously to the respective plates. Under the same
            conditions of applied total power same starting voltage, but
            higher applied direct current because of their lower
            sustaining/extinction voltage), three pulse generators 50
            built with Alzak plates having areas of 64, 78 and 128
            cm.sup.2 respectively were tested with the same power
            supply. </p>
          <p align="left">These pulse generators conduct 5-fold higher
            DC currents, transduce 3-fold higher peak pulse RMS currents
            and yield a 20 to 30-fold increase in pps (from 20 to 600
            pps) at similar field strengths, when compared with the
            results obtained using hardened aluminum plates. </p>
          <p align="left">A comparison of pulse counts at the axial
            probe 62 (see FIGS. 18 and 19) in pulse generators 50 and
            the pulse counts at the cathode 54 showed that the axial
            probe 62 accurately reflects interelectrode events. This
            correspondence was confirmed using oscillographic analysis
            of the probe waveform, which showed it to be functionally
            equivalent to that measured at the cathode 54. </p>
          <p align="left">Typically, for a closed high vacuum pulse
            generator 50 with a plate area of 128 cm.sup.2 and an
            interelectrode gap of 5 cm, a breakdown voltage of 668
            volts, an average applied current of 500 ma, and at 200 pps,
            the pulse amplitude is more than 300 volts. Under rotary
            pumpdown conditions and for an identical pulse generator,
            the pulse amplitude (encompassing both positive and negative
            components, the latter being the prominent value) increases
            with decreasing pressure, from 60 volts at about 0.5 Torr
            (with 5 mA DC) to &gt;300 volts at 0.008 Torr. In the closed
            high vacuum pulse generator with H34 plates having an area
            of 128 cm.sup.2 (device #1), higher resolution oscillographs
            taken at the axial probe 62, show that the negative
            component precedes the positive reversal and has a typically
            higher amplitude (140 V vs. 80 to 120 V, respectively, for
            example). Clearly, upon an abnormal glow discharge pulse,
            the recovery of the field strength within these pulse
            generators overshoots a `closed switch state` (where the
            current I.about.O) and results in a net flow of positive
            charge past the probe, towards the cathode (which is the
            floating ground reference level for these measurements). </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 11 </p>
          <p align="left">Effect of Capacitance on PAGD Rate </p>
          <p align="left">Using the same breakdown voltage of about 668
            VDC, the effect of varying the capacitance of the power
            supply, set in parallel with the pulse generator (device
            #1), on the frequency of PAGD production was determined
            while maintaining all other variables constant
            (interelectrode gap, plate area, applied voltage and current
            levels). Linear regression shows that, under these
            conditions, the PAGD frequency is increased by lower
            capacitances. The log slope indicates that the pps rate is
            doubled as the capacitance decreases by 2/3 rds.
            Measurements were also taken of the `non-dynamic`
            capacitances of pulse generators with H34 aluminum plates
            having different plate areas. These were insignificant when
            compared with the parallel capacitances used in the power
            supply , used in the tests, and were observed to vary in
            accordance with the dielectric law, i.e. doubling the plate
            area doubled the capacitance. This can be seen in the Table

          <p align="left"><i>Optimum Arrangement and Geometry:</i> </p>
          <p align="left">Prolonged operation of the pulse generators 50
            has provided the geometries for eliciting PAGD production
            including: </p>
          <p align="left">1) It is advantageous if the discharge does
            not wander to the back of the anode 56/cathode 54 and this
            is facilitated by using semi-cylindrical anode 56/cathode 54
            in cylindrical housings 52 and flat anode 54/cathode 56
            (rectangular, square or circular) in parallelepiped-shaped
            housings. However interelectrode gap tests are best done
            with flat plates which assure an homogeneous potential.
            Moreover, the semi-cylindrical electrodes are best made of
            hardened aluminum, at least 0.5 to 1 mm thick, and this
            requires forming them to the right curvature, given that
            foil alternatives are not resistant to the deleterious
            effect of high-current PAGD transduction at very high
            frequencies and do not withstand disruptive VAD discharges.
            Nonetheless, a semi-cylindrical electrode configuration in a
            housing 52 makes the sheaths (where ionic recombination
            occurs during glow discharge) near the electrodes and the
            housing wall coincide, and this can be highly advantageous
            for sustaining PAGD production. The same applies to flat
            plates in flat surface parallelepiped housings. </p>
          <p align="left">2) The most effective axial probe 62 is either
            a single half-length rigid rod or a pair of axial probes 62
            separated at the center of the pulse generator 50 by a gap
            of more than 1 cm, 4-6 cm being optimum. Whereas an axial
            wire will perform satisfactorily as a probe 62, the rigid
            rod has the advantage of not yielding to a direct mechanical
            transduction of the electrodynamic force effected upon it by
            the discharge or to force created by the acquisition of a
            constant space charge. A split axial probe 62 facilitates
            the exciter function and assures PAGD operation by
            preventing a formation of a stable axial space-charge at
            high-current operation. </p>
          <p align="left">3) A cooling coil (made of rubber, polymer,
            glass or copper tubing) surrounding housing 52 is useful to
            counterbalance the heating of the anode 56/cathode 54 which
            promotes the production of semi-thermionic VAD channels and
            even thermionic normal glow discharges, specifically at
            applied currents of more than 200 mA during PAGD operation.
            A coolant pipe system that weaves through the plates can
            also be used for this purpose, in which case flat plates are
            preferred. </p>
          <p align="left">4) Larger anode 56/cathode 54 surfaces are
            required as the interelectrode gap is increased. And
            inversely, larger anode 54/cathode 56 surfaces operate best
            (i.e. require the lowest applied voltages) if larger
            interelectrode gaps are used; however, the breakdown voltage
            also increases with larger interelectrode gaps. </p>
          <p align="left">5) One of the limitations of these pulse
            generators stems from their continuous operation at high
            applied currents and from eventual slippage into the VAD
            regime, both of which promote a deposit of sputtered metal
            atoms on the inner walls of the housing 52 thereby making
            them conductive. In order to minimize this problem,
            electromagnets may be wound longitudinally over the housing
            52 (one at each end), to limit the dispersion of the
            discharge vortices. </p>
          <p align="left"><i>Factors Affecting PAGD Production:</i> </p>
          <p align="left">It is apparent that several factors affect
            PAGD production namely: cold cathode work function, voltage,
            current, parallel capacitance, gas fill, pressure, geometry
            plate area and interelectrode gap distance. Except for
            capacitance at the high end of the scale, each of these
            factors affect the high and low limits of the PAGD, for any
            given set of conditions. Heretofore, factors such as plate
            area in vacuum tubes have not been previously identified as
            factors which affect the breakdown field values and the
            sustaining/extinction potentials of a glow or an arc
            discharge. This suggests that the observed auto-electronic
            field emission in the PAGD regime is a function of physical
            factors which to date have been unrecognized. It further
            suggests that field emission is not a property exclusive to
            the VAD, i.e. that it is also a property of the pulsed
            operation of an abnormal glow discharge in low to very high
            vacua. </p>
          <p align="left">The present pulse generators 50 provide an
            optimal design capable of transducing high peak pulse
            currents at very low field strength, over a wide range of
            frequencies with minimal slippage of the PAGD operation into
            either the NGD or the VAD regimes. </p>
          <p align="left">In conclusion, we have disclosed a series of
            low to very high vacuum pulse generators which support the
            production of PAGDs. In testing these devices we have shown
            that: </p>
          <p align="left">the low field strengths and typical low
            emission current densities observed in the PAGD regime are
            not predicted by any existing field emission or space-charge
            theories; </p>
          <p align="left">the PAGD regime responds asymmetrically to the
            polarity of the applied voltage at high applied currents; </p>
          <p align="left">at low applied currents, the PAGD pulse rate
            increases with the applied voltage and the current up to an
            observed plateau; </p>
          <p align="left">at mid to high applied currents, the PAGD
            pulse rate increases with an increase in current and with a
            lowering of the extinction potential; </p>
          <p align="left">the PAGD pulse rate also varies with the
            composition of the cathode material (the pulse rate is
            promoted by materials having a low work function) and
            increases with a decrease in pressure, during pumpdown, to a
            maximal peak rate, thereafter either diminishing to the
            point at which the discharge extinguishes or gives way to
            x-ray production (depending on the magnitude of the applied
            potential); </p>
          <p align="left">larger area plates lower the field strength
            values needed to elicit comparable PAGD production, displace
            the PAGD region downward in the pressure scale and increase
            the peak PAGD rate; </p>
          <p align="left">higher power supply capacitances slow down the
            PAGD rate. </p>

          <p align="left">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
          <p align="left">1. Field of the Invention </p>
          <p align="left">This invention relates to energy conversion
            circuits utilizing discharge tubes operating in the pulsed
            abnormal glow discharge (PAGD) regime. </p>
          <p align="left">2. Review of the Art </p>
          <p align="left">Such discharge tubes and circuits
            incorporating them are described in our copending U.S.
            patent application Ser. Nos. 07/922,863 and 07/961,531. The
            first of these applications discloses discharge tube
            constructions particularly suited for PAGD operation, and
            the second discloses certain practical applications of such
            tubes, particularly in electric motor control circuits. The
            review of the art contained in those applications is
            incorporated herein by reference, as is their disclosure and
            drawings. </p>
          <p align="left">It is known that there are anomalous cathode
            reaction forces associated with the cathodic emissions
            responsible for vacuum arc discharges, the origin and
            explanation of which have been the subject of extensive
            discussion in scientific literature, being related as it is
            to ongoing discussion of the relative merits of the laws of
            electrodynamics as variedly formulated by Ampere,
            Biot-Savart and Lorentz. Examples of literature on the
            subject are referenced later in this application. </p>
          <p align="left">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
          <p align="left">The particular conditions which prevail in a
            discharge tube operated in the PAGD regime, in which a
            plasma eruption from the cathode is self-limiting and
            collapses before completion of a plasma channel to the anode
            gives rise to transient conditions which favour the
            exploitation of anomalous cathode reaction forces. </p>
          <p align="left">We have found that apparatus utilizing
            discharge tubes operated in a self-sustaining pulsed
            abnormal glow discharge regime, in a double ported circuit
            designed so that energy input to the tube utilized to
            initiate a glow discharge pulse is handled by an input
            circuit substantially separate from an output circuit
            receiving energy from the tube during collapse of a pulse,
            provides valuable energy conversion capabilities. </p>
          <p align="left">The invention extends to a method of energy
            conversion, comprising initiating plasma eruptions from the
            cathode of a discharge tube operating in a pulsed abnormal
            glow discharge regime utilizing electrical energy from a
            source in a first circuit connected to said discharge tube,
            and capturing electrical energy generated by the collapse of
            such eruptions in a second circuit connected to said
            discharge tube. </p>

          <p align="left">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
          <p align="left">The basic PAGD function and the construction
            of discharge tubes specifically designed for PAGD operation
            are described in our corresponding copending applications
            Nos. 07/922,863 (the '863 application) and 07/961,531 (the
            '531 application). For purposes of the experiments described
            below four aluminum H34 plate devices (one with 64 and three
            with 128 cm.sup.2 plate areas) and three aluminum (H200)
            plate devices (one with 64 and two with 128 cm.sup.2 plate
            areas), with interelectrode gap lengths of 3 to 5.5 cm, were
            utilized at the indicated vacua, under pumpdown conditions
            and with either air or argon (ultra high purity,
            spectroscopic grade 99.9996% pure) constituting the residual
            gas mixture. The pumpdown conditions were as described in
            the '863 application. Some experiments were performed with
            the tubes under active evacuation, at steady-state
            conditions, while others utilized sealed devices enclosing
            the desired residual gas pressures. </p>
          <p align="left">The circuit designs utilized in the various
            experiments to be described are set out further below, and
            represent further developments and extensions of the
            circuits set forth in the '531 application. </p>
          <p align="left">Test equipment utilized was as follows: </p>
          <p align="left">An Edwards (trade mark) thermocouple gauge
            (TC-7) was employed for the determination of pressure down
            to 1 micron of mercury (0.001 Torr). </p>
          <p align="left">Banks of Beckman (trade mark) rms multimeters
            225 and 330 (30 and 100 kHz bandwidths, respectively) were
            utilized for all current measurements. </p>
          <p align="left">Frequency meters capable of discriminating
            events up to 0.1 nanosecond apart, and having adjustable
            amplitude windows, were used. Direct analysis on a Tektronix
            (trade mark) dual-trace, storage scope (Model 549) was also
            carried out for both parameters. </p>
          <p align="left">Split-phase, single-phase and two-phase motors
            were employed, of the synchronous, induction and universal
            types, as previously described in the '531 application, in
            the accessory electromechanical arm that may be coupled to
            the power producing circuit described in the present
            application. </p>
          <p align="left">Large banks of 12 V, 6 Ah lead-acid gel cells
            (Sonnenschein (trade mark) A212/6S) were utilized either as
            power sources (designated as drive packs) or as accumulators
            of the energy (referred to as charge packs) captured by the
            test circuits. Charge packs made of rechargeable 9 V NiCad
            or of nominally nonrechargeable C-Zn or alkaline batteries
            were also utilized. </p>
          <p align="left">PAGD emission areas were determined by
            metallographic examination of a series of craters produced
            by PAGDs in clean H34 cathodes, under a metallurgical Zeiss
            (trade mark) standard 18 microscope equipped with an
            epi-fluorescent condenser, very high power apochromatic
            objectives and a 100 W mercury lamp. For best results a
            focusable oblique source of light (12 V halogen) was also
            added to the incident light. </p>
          <p align="left">Following our low and high applied current
            studies on PAGD production as set forth in the '863
            application, we noticed that the AC rms value of the
            component associated with each abnormal glow discharge pulse
            varied nonlinearly with the magnitude of the applied
            current. We originally noted the existence of a current
            induced shift of the entire PAGD region upward in the
            pressure scale: while the PAGD regime became more clearly
            defined as the applied constant DC was increased, the
            pressure required to observe the PAGD increased two to three
            orders of magnitude. In the course of these rarefaction
            studies we found that, at applied currents of 1 mA or less,
            the rms value of the different AC waveforms associated with
            the consecutive regimes of the discharge
            (TRD.fwdarw.NGD.fwdarw.AGD+PAGD) was, by more than half log,
            inferior to the value of the applied DC current, during the
            first two regimes (TRD and NGD) and reached a value
            equivalent to the applied current with the onset of
            spontaneous PAGD, at pressures &lt;0.1 Torr (see FIG. 1);
            however, in the downward tail of the PAGD regime (down to
            3*10-3 Torr), the AC rms current component of each PAGD
            again decreased to more than half log of the intensity of
            the applied DC value, in a manner proportional to the log of
            the decreasing pressure. In stark contrast, at high applied
            currents of .sup..about. 500 mA, and aside from the high
            current-induced upward shift in pressure of the PAGD regime
            (to the point that the compression of the previous regimes
            on the pressure scale results in their suppressing, as was
            the case in the present example), the AC rms component
            associated with each pulse (see closed circles, FIG. 2) is,
            from onset of the discharge at .sup..about. 8 Torr, greater
            in magnitude than the value of the applied current (open
            circles, FIG. 2). Under the conditions described, the
            distribution of the field current associated with each
            pulsed abnormal glow discharge approached (on a linear Y
            axis; not shown) an unimodal gaussian distribution with the
            pressure peak at .sup..about. 1 Torr, and a corresponding
            observed maximum of 7.5.times. higher AC rms values than the
            applied DC values. </p>
          <p align="left">We have previously described in the '863
            application how the PAGD frequency is affected by several
            factors, namely: the magnitude of the parallel discharge
            capacitance, the value of the negative pressure for the
            relevant vacuum PAGD range, the magnitude of the applied
            potential, the magnitude of the applied direct current, the
            interelectrode gap distance and the area of the parallel
            plate electrodes. In the '531 application we have also
            described how the wiring configuration (plate diode versus
            triode) affects the PAGD frequency by adding tungsten
            autoelectronic emissions from the axial electrode, to those
            emissions from the plate. There are other factors which
            limit the PAGD regime of discharge and have also been
            discussed in the '863 application. The following data
            indicates their specific effect upon PAGD frequency. </p>
          <p align="left">In the data presented in Table 1, control of
            the frequency parameter for the circuit shown in FIG. 9 is
            by a ballast resistance R1 within a specific range of
            interest (.sup..about. 800-150 ohms, for Table 1
            experimental conditions), and this in turn increases the
            applied current which, at "high current" values (i.e.
            &gt;100 mA, as for Table 1 conditions), will drive the PAGD
            frequency up, as previously reported in the '863
            application. </p>
          <p align="left">Table 2 shows the effect of the progressive
            displacement of a given frequency, chosen as 200 PPS, with
            the cumulative pulse count of the same device, in the plate
            diode configuration. This displacement of the same frequency
            (cf. group #'s 1-3, Table 2) onto higher pressure regions is
            shown to be promoted by the alteration of the work function
            of the PAGD emitting cathode, such as this is caused by the
            cumulative pulse count and resultant crater formation on the
            electrode surface. After the first million pulses, the anode
            facing cathode surface is completely turned over by emission
            sites, and this corresponds well to the threshold crossed by
            group #2, Table 2. Once the cathode surfaces are broken in,
            the rates shown in groups #3 and 4, Table 2, tend to remain
            constant. Originally we wondered whether this might be
            caused by the alteration of the electrostatic profile of the
            plasma sheaths at the periphery of the envelope, due to the
            mirroring deposits that result from the sputter of ions and
            trapped neutral atoms (from air gases or metallic vapor)
            associated with the autoelectronic emission mechanism (and
            from further emissions triggered in turn, by secondary ionic
            bombardment of the cathode with molecular species present in
            the plasma ball formed over the primary emission site).
            However, reversal of the plate polarity (firing the ex-anode
            as a crater-free cathode) for over a million counts,
            followed by re-reversal to the original polarity, the entire
            operation being performed in air as the residual gas
            substrate, led to the partial recovery of the original work
            function for as long as the test was run (1.5*10.sup.4
            pulses), as shown by a comparison of groups #2,4 and 5,
            Table 2. From a metallographic examination of the surfaces
            of plates used solely as anodes, we have also concluded that
            prolonged PAGD operation has the effect, not only of
            cleaning the anode surface from surface films and adsorbed
            gases, as ionic bombardment promoted by electromagnetic
            induction coils does, but it also does more--it polishes the
            target surface and smooths it by a molecular erosive action.
            Observations of the surface of reversed cathodes, shows the
            same smoothing and polishing effects observed in exclusive
            anodes. Thus the recovery of the PAGD rates promoted by
            polarity reversal of the plates is not a function of the
            sputter-promoted mirroring deposits on the envelope wall,
            but a function of the actual work-function of the emitting
            cathode. </p>
          <p align="left">Another variable that interacts with the PAGD
            frequency is the molecular nature of the residual gas: Table
            3 shows the differential frequency response of air with a
            halogen quencher, argon, for the same pulse generator
            employed in the tests of Table 2. It is apparent that argon
            obtains much higher rates of AGD pulsation for the same
            range of negative pressure, for the same "broken in"
            cathode, than does the air mixture. All these measurements
            were taken at cathode support-stem temperatures of
            35.degree. C. </p>
          <p align="left">Time of operation is also a variable affecting
            the frequency and operating characteristics of the cathode,
            as it becomes expressed by the passive heating of the
            cathode, an effect which is all the more pronounced at the
            higher pressures and at the higher frequencies examined.
            Utilizing the triode circuit discussed in the next section,
            the pulse rate of a PAGD generator with 64 cm.sup.2 plates
            can be seen (see FIG. 3) to decrease, at a negative pressure
            of 0.8 Torr, from 41 PPS to the operating plateau of 6 PPS
            within 15 minutes of continuous operation, as the
            temperature of the cathode support increased from 19.degree.
            to .sup..about. 44.degree. C. As the temperature plateaus at
            .sup..about. 51.degree..+-.1.degree. C., so does the pulse
            rate at 6 PPS, for the remaining 48 minutes of continuous
            operation. </p>
          <p align="left">However, in order to confirm this
            time-dependent heating effect and threshold, we also
            performed the same experiment, utilizing the same circuit
            and the same negative air pressure, with twice as large a
            cathode area (128 cm.sup.2, which should take nearly twice
            as long to heat), being operated for 18 one-minute long
            continuous periods equally spaced apart by 15 minutes of
            passive cooling, with the cathode stem always at
            19.7.degree. to 21.degree. C., room temperature at the start
            of each period. The results surprised us, inasmuch as they
            showed that for a larger area tube which takes longer to
            heat to the same temperatures at comparable rates of PAGD
            triggering, one could observe a much earlier frequency
            reduction (by half, within the first 5 minutes or periods of
            interrupted functioning) in the absence of any significant
            heating effect (&lt;1.5.degree. C.) of the cathode (see FIG.
            4). Repetition of these experiments has led us to conclude
            that, as shown in FIG. 5, the variable responsible for this
            repeatedly observed reduction in the PAGD frequency, when
            the PAGD operation sequence is systematically interrupted,
            is the state of charge/discharge of the battery pack (the
            charge pack) at the output of the triode circuit in
            question: the PPM rates in FIG. 5 decrease rapidly with the
            steepest rate of charging of the charge pack and the fastest
            recovery rate of its open circuit voltage; above a given
            state of charge, when the open voltage of the charge pack
            climbs more slowly (&gt;340 V), in a log fashion, the PPM
            rate stabilizes at its plateau values. </p>
          <p align="left">Confirmation of the importance of the charge
            pack in the PAGD function of the present circuitry here
            considered, comes from the fact that the size (the number of
            cells) and the intrinsic capacitance of the charge pack
            affect the PAGD frequency dramatically (see Table 4):
            increasing the charge pack size of 29 cells to 31, by 7%
            leads to a 10-fold reduction in frequency; further increases
            in the number of charge pack cells extinguishes the
            phenomenon. On the upper end of the scale, this effect
            appears to be tied in to restrictions that it places on the
            ability of the larger charge packs to accept the discharge
            power output once the charge pack voltage exceeds the PAGD
            amplitude potential. All of these measurements were
            conducted with the same 128 cm.sup.2 plate PAGD generator,
            at a pressure of 0.8 Torr and in the triode configuration
            (see FIG. 9). </p>
          <p align="left">Other factors can also affect the frequency:
            the motion of external permanent magnetic fields oriented
            longitudinally with the interelectrode gap, external pulsed
            or alternating magnetic fields, external electrostatic or
            electromagnetic fields, specific connections of the earth
            ground, and the presence of a parallel capacitative,
            capacitative-inductive or self-inductive arm in the circuit,
            such as we have described for our electromechanical PAGD
            transduction method as described in the '531 application. </p>
          <p align="left">Analysis of the modulation of PAGD amplitude
            is simpler than that of its frequency, because fewer factors
            affect this parameter: (1) magnitude of the applied
            potential, (2) interelectrode gap distance and (3) the
            negative pressure, as shown in the '863 application, for
            "low" applied currents. As the magnitude of the applied
            potential itself is limited by the gap and the pressure, to
            the desired conditions of breakdown, the important control
            parameter for the PAGD amplitude is the pressure factor.
            This is shown in FIGS. 6 and. 7, respectively for "low" (5
            mA) and "high" (.sup..about. 500 mA) applied currents and
            for the same plate diode configuration of a H34 Al 128
            cm.sup.2 plate PAGD generator (5 cm gap), in the simple
            circuit described in the '863 application; it is apparent
            that both positive and negative components of the amplitude
            of these pulses in the oscillograph, are a function of the
            pressure, but the maximum cut-off limit of our equipment,
            for the negative component (at 240 volts for the "low"
            current experiment and at 120 volts for the "high" current),
            precluded us from measuring the peak negative voltage of
            these pulses. However, rms measurements of the pulse
            amplitude at the plates and DC measurements at the circuit
            output to the charge pack indicate that the negative
            component increases with decreasing pressure to a maximum,
            for a given arrangement of potential and gap distance; no
            pressure-dependent bell shape variation of the pulse
            amplitude, as that seen for the positive component at "high"
            applied currents (FIG. 7) is observed with the negative
            amplitude component. For the typical range of 0.8 to 0.5
            Torr, the rms value for pulse amplitude varies from 320 to
            480 volts, for a 5.5 cm gap distance and applied DC voltages
            of 540 to 580. PAGD amplitude is a critical factor for the
            design of the proper size of the charge pack to be utilized
            in the optimal circuit. </p>
          <p align="left">The development of the circuits to be
            described stemmed from fundamental alterations to the
            principles implicit in our previous methods of
            electromechanical transduction of AGD plasma pulses as
            described in the '531 application. Whereas this
            electromechanical coupling (capacitative and
            self-inductive), utilized directly, energizes the AGD pulses
            inverted from the DC input by the vacuum generator, the
            purpose of the development that led to the presently
            described experiments was to capture efficiently, in the
            simplest of ways, most of the pulse energy in a closed
            circuit, so that power measurements for the energy
            transduction efficiency of the observed endogenous pulsation
            could be carried out. Ideally, comparative DC power
            measurements would be performed at both the input and output
            of the system, taking into account the losses generated
            across the components; this would obviate the measurement
            problems posed by the myriad of transformations implicit in
            the variable frequency, amplitude, crest factor and
            duty-cycle values of the PAGD regime, and necessitated some
            form of rectification of the inverted tube output. From the
            start our objective was to do so as simply as possible.
            Early circuits utilizing half-wave rectification methods
            coupled in series to a capacitative arm (for DC isolation of
            the two battery packs), with the charge pack also placed in
            series, showed marginal recoveries of the energy spent at
            the PAGD generator input. Attempts at inserting a polar
            full-wave rectification bridge led, as shown in FIG. 8, to
            the splitting of the capacitor into capacitors C3 and C5, at
            the rectification bridge input, and capacitor C4 in series
            with both capacitors, all three being in a series string in
            parallel with the PAGD generator. Under these conditions a
            DC motor/generator could be run continuously in the same
            direction at the transversal output (U1 and U2) of the
            bridge; but if this inductive load was replaced with a
            battery pack CP (charge recovery pack), either the parallel
            capacitor C4 had to remain in the circuit, for the diode
            configuration or, less desirably, a further capacitor C6
            could replace C4 and connect one electrode, preferably the
            cathode C, to the axial member of the discharge tube T, thus
            resulting in a first triode configuration as actually shown
            in FIG. 8. Energy recovery efficiencies of the order of 15
            to 60% were obtained utilizing C6 in this manner, but
            measurements of the potential and currents present at the
            output from the rectifier bridge were substantially lower
            than those obtained using optimal values of C4. Effectively,
            under these conditions, much of the power output from the
            tube was never captured by the output circuit formed by the
            second, right hand arm of the system and, being prevented
            from returning as counter-currents to the drive pack DP by
            diodes D1 and D4, was dissipated and absorbed by the
            interelectrode plasma, electrode heating and parasitic
            oscillations. </p>
          <p align="left">Solutions to this problem were explored using
            the circuit shown in FIG. 9, which still maintains the
            necessary communication link for the quasi-sinusoidal
            oscillation of the capacitatively stored charges at the
            input and outputs of the rectification bridge, but
            integrated the functions of capacitor C4 into the single
            rectification circuit, in the form of an asymmetric
            capacitative bridge C7a and C7b placed transversally to the
            capacitative bridge formed by C3 and C5 and in parallel with
            the charge pack CP at the output from the rectification
            bridge D5, D6, D2, D3. This second capacitative bridge is so
            disposed as to have its centre point connected to the anode
            A through capacitor C5. If the axial member of the Tube T
            were to connect to the junction of D2 and D3 instead of at
            the junction D5-D6, the function of bridge C7a and C7b would
            be connected to the cathode C through capacitor C3. The
            capacitative bridge is insulated from the charge pack whose
            voltage it stabilizes, by rectifiers D7 and D8, which also
            prevent leakage of charge across C7a and C7b. The anode and
            cathode oscillations generated by the electrostatic charge
            transduction through C3 and C5 into the poles of the charge
            pack are trapped by the transversal transduction of the C7
            bridge, at the outputs from the rectification bridge, of
            which the oscillation has to become split between the bridge
            inputs into half-waves, for electrostatic transduction and
            full wave rectification to occur. In fact, under these
            conditions, removal of the C7 bridge will suppress the PAGD
            phenomenon, unless other circuit variables are also altered.
            The transversal bridge is thus an essential piece of this
            novel circuit. Variations in the circuit as shown in FIG. 10
            were then studied, the first two being selectable utilizing
            switch S2 (FIG. 9). </p>
          <p align="left">The presence of the capacitative bridge
            effectively reduces the dynamic impedance of the charge pack
            CP so that the output circuit approximates to a
            characteristic in which it presents a very high impedance to
            the tube T at potentials below a certain level, and a very
            low impedance at potentials above that level. </p>
          <p align="left">With this modified circuit, more effective
            recovery of the energy produced by collapse of the PAGD
            pulses is possible, with more effective isolation from the
            input circuit utilized to trigger the pulses. Under these
            conditions, the energy captured by this circuit at the
            output, is not directly related to that utilized in
            triggering the pulses from the input. The attainment of this
            condition critically depends on the large capacitance of the
            transversal bridge being able to transfer the output energy
            from the tube T into the charge pack CP. Under these
            conditions, we have found, as will be shown below, that the
            large peak pulse currents released by collapse of the PAGD
            pulses released more energy than is used to trigger them,
            and these findings appeared to tally with other observations
            (abnormal volt-ampere characteristics and anomalous pulse
            currents, etc.) associated with the anomalous cathode
            reaction forces that accompany the auto-electronic
            emission-triggered PAGD regime. Experiments so far indicate
            that the power output can be increased proportionately to
            the series value of C3, C5 and the two identical C7
            capacitors. </p>
          <p align="left">The circuit of FIG. 10 can be integrated with
            a circuit such as that disclosed in the '863 application as
            shown in FIG. 11, in which a part of the energy recovered
            can be shunted by the switch S4 into an induction motor M1
            having rotor R, to a degree determined by the adjustment of
            potentiometer R4 and the value selected for C4. </p>
          <p align="left">The circuit of FIG. 11 can be further
            developed as exemplified in FIG. 12 to include
            configurations which provide switching permitting
            interchange of the functions of charge packs and the drive
            packs, it being borne in mind that the nominal potential of
            the drive pack must be substantially higher than that of the
            charge pack, the former needing to exceed the breakdown
            potential of the tube at the beginning of a PAGD cycle, and
            the latter to be less than the extinction potential. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 12 essentially represents a duplication
            of the circuit of FIG. 11, the two circuits however sharing
            two identical battery packs BP1 and BP2, and being provided
            with a six pole two way switch, the contact sets of which
            are identified as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6. When the
            contacts are in position A as shown, battery pack BP1 acts
            as a drive pack for both circuits, with the upper half (as
            shown) of the battery pack BP2 forming the charge pack for
            the upper circuit, and the lower half forming the charge
            pack for the lower circuit. When the pack BP1 is at least
            partially discharged, the switch is thrown so that contacts
            move to position B, which reverses the function of the
            battery packs thus allowing extended operation of the motors
            in each circuit each time the switch is thrown. </p>
          <p align="left">Based on the manufacturer's data, and using
            current values within the range of our experimentation as
            discussed in the next sections, an optimal discharge cycle
            for a fully charged 6.0 Ahr battery pack at 0.300 A draw is
            20 hours, as claimed by the manufacturer, and this
            corresponds to a cycling between 100% (12.83 V/cell open
            circuit and load start voltage) and &lt;1% (10.3 V/cell load
            voltage) of the battery's absolute charge capacity. Even
            though the discharge mechanism is a time cumulative process
            with a log function, the discharge can, within 4 to 5 hour
            time segments (or periods with 20-25% of the full range), be
            regarded as practically linear with time. This trait, or
            linearization of the discharge slope, becomes more marked
            with advancing age and decreasing absolute storage capacity
            of the cells. </p>
          <p align="left">The proportionality between open circuit
            voltage and the percentage of residual relative capacity for
            these cells when new (uncycled and not yet aged) is uniform
            over 98% of the permissible charge capacity withdrawal; in
            practice this translates into a slope that becomes steeper
            with time, while the absolute storage capacity diminishes.
            In turn, this decreasing absolute capacity of the cells
            results in shorter load discharge times and their further
            linearization. </p>
          <p align="left">A circuit in .general accordance with FIG. 9,
            employed in the studies reported in this and the following
            sections, utilizes a drive pack of 46*12 V Lead acid
            gel-cells each with a 6.0 Ah rating, and a charge pack with
            28 or 29*12 V identical cells. The charge pack was cycled
            anywhere from 11.2 V to 12.8 V/cell (open circuit voltages),
            within the proportional region of the relative capacity
            slope, to yield a capacity increment in the order of 50%
            (e.g. from 20 to 70%), anywhere within the range of 2 to
            100% of its total charge capacity, assumed for now as
            invariant. The charging process, hereinafter referred to as
            a PAGD run, took about 20-30 minutes under optimal
            conditions. The drive pack typically consumed, in the same
            period of time, 4 to 11% of its initial total capacity , its
            open circuit voltage typically falling 0.1 to 0.2 V per cell
            after a PAGD run, within the open circuit range of 12.8
            V/cell (100% relative capacity) and 11.2 V/cell
            (.sup..about. 2%). At the 100% capacity benchmark, the drive
            pack would theoretically have 20 h*46 cells*12.83 V/cell*0.3
            A=3.5 KWh, and the charge pack, for example, 20 h*29*12.83
            V/cell*0.3 A=2.2 KWh. Since the capacity per cell is linear
            with the open circuit voltage within the proportional range,
            as claimed by the manufacturer, we projected the open
            circuit voltage intercepts on the manufacturer's
            proportional curve in order to determine the residual
            percentage of the total relative capacity and the standard
            hours of operation left, from any experimental open circuit
            voltage measurements. </p>
          <p align="left">Three pulse generators (2*128 cm.sup.2 and
            1*64 cm.sup.2 plate areas) were employed in these studies;
            they were operated in PAGD runs at 1-120 pulse/second rates,
            within a negative pressure range of 0.2 to 0.8 Torr and with
            applied direct currents of 0.2 to 0.6 A. </p>
          <p align="left">Both drive and charge packs utilized cells
            which were bought new at the same time and had initial
            charge values of 12.4 to 12.55 V/cell (open circuit). These
            batteries are capable of energy densities of 33-35 Whr/kg.
            However, the experiments shown in Table 5 are selected from
            a series that spanned nearly 12 months, beginning 6 months
            after purchase; hence, loss of absolute storage capacity by
            the batteries had occurred in the intervening time, as a
            function of both age and charge/discharge cycle life. </p>

            stroboscopically), respectively. </p>
          <p align="left">From these figures of Table 5, and utilizing
            the data for the two first examples shown, we calculated the
            predicted performance of the system based on the open
            voltage measurements. In the first example, where the system
            was run continuously without interruption, the charge pack
            increased the percentage of its total capacity by 43% (a
            two-fold increase in capacity) and, during the same period,
            the driver pack decreased the percentage of its total
            capacity by 7% (a .sup..about. 10% decrease in capacity
            relative to the percentage of residual total capacity at the
            start, i.e. 77%) (cp. columns 6 and 8, Table 5). Subtracting
            the predicted initial total energy (0.835 KWh) available to
            the charge pack before the experimental run (first line of
            column 9, Table 5) from the predicted total energy (1.823
            KWh, second line of column 9) available to the charge pack
            after the PAGD charge run, gives us the total energy gained
            by the charge pack: 0.988 KWh (column 10) in 21.5 minutes
            (column 12) of continuous PAGD performance. Conversely,
            subtracting the predicted final total energy (2.4 KWh)
            available to the driver after the experimental run (fourth
            line of column 9, Table 5) from the predicted total energy
            (2.66 KWh, third line) available to the driver before the
            PAGD charge run, gives us the total energy lost by the drive
            pack: 0.26 KWh in 21.5 minutes. If we divide the total
            available energy gained by the charge pack, by the total
            energy lost by the drive pack, we obtain a surplus factor of
            3.9.times., or 388% of the breakeven point (column 15). The
            same values result from dividing the charge pack % of total
            capacity gain by the drive pack % of total capacity lost,
            and then downscaling this value by multiplying it by the
            typical scale factor for the two packs, 29/46=0.63.times.. </p>
          <p align="left">In an analogous fashion, we analyzed the
            results for the second example shown in Table 5. Here, the
            charger increased the percentage of its total capacity by
            45.5% (a 22.75 fold increase in estimated total relative
            capacity) and, during the same period, the driver decreased
            the percentage of its predicted total capacity by 7% (a
            .sup..about. 17.5% decrease in capacity relative to the
            percentage of residual total capacity at the start, i.e.
            40%). By dividing the predicted total available energy
            gained by the charge pack (0.962 KWh/18 minutes) by the
            expected total energy lost by the driver pack (0.246 Kwh/18
            minutes) we obtain a surplus factor of 3.9.times., or 391%
            of the breakeven point. This corresponds to an interrupted,
            total sequential run of 18 minutes, each minute-long run
            being separated by a cooling and voltage relaxation period
            of 15 minutes before the next run is carried out, at an
            average PAGD frequency of 61 PPS. </p>
          <p align="left">Analysis of the remaining results illustrates
            how a number of PAGD controlling parameters interact to
            determine conditions for effective maintenance of a PAGD
            regime. The lower gain and higher loss per unit time
            registered for the third run of Table 5, which results in
            the lower breakeven efficiency of 230% and a smaller net
            power production rate than before (power estimates of 1.396
            kWh/h of PAGD operation vs 2.387 kWh/h, for the second run,
            Table 5) illustrate, for example, the combined effect of
            lowering the pressure (0.8 to 0.7 Torr) and running the PAGD
            continuously (the heating effect), both of which depress the
            PAGD frequency. The fourth run of Table 5 identifies the
            continuous performance of a "broken in" softer grade of
            aluminum (column 19), having a lower work-function (as
            determined from the higher PAGD frequency spectrum) than the
            harder H34 plates of the previous examples, and shows that,
            despite the series value of the total capacitance being
            higher (5,333 mfd vs 4,030 mfd for runs one through three),
            and despite the higher vacuum (0.2 Torr), the lower
            work-function results in a higher frequency; however, even
            though this run registers a predicted higher breakeven
            efficiency (310%) than the previous experiments, these
            conditions result in a 4/5-fold lower estimate of net power
            produced, when compared to the previous three PAGD runs. </p>
          <p align="left">PAGD runs 5 and 6, Table 5, illustrate the
            effect of switching on the auxiliary electromechanical arm
            of the circuit shown in FIG. 11. Increasing the amount of
            charge capacitatively shunted into the electromechanical arm
            by higher C4 values (column 27), and increasing the current
            that feeds the squirrel cage induction motor utilized by
            lowering R4 (column 28), results in a power capture by the
            charge pack that registers an energy loss (predicted to be
            96% efficient, falling short 4% of breakeven recovery), as
            most of the tube output power is spent in the
            electromechanical arm and its motor effect. Furthermore,
            under the conditions of maximum electromechanical action,
            the drain imposed on the drive pack becomes considerable
            (see loss in columns 10 and 13), even if the C3 and C5
            values are reduced, column 21, Table 5). These runs also
            illustrate how the motor appears to function as an
            electrical induction generator having rpm values much higher
            than the synchronous values prescribed by the frequency of
            the PAGD (column 29, Table 5). </p>
          <p align="left">The extremely large breakeven efficiency of
            PAGD run 5, Table 5, indicates that with selected values of
            C4 and R4, it is possible to operate the motor in the
            auxiliary arm and still accumulate excess energy from the
            PAGD production in the charge pack. </p>
          <p align="left">Runs 7 and 8 illustrate results obtained for
            64 cm.sup.2 plates, and a shorter interelectrode gap
            distance, for two pressures (0.8 and 0.5 Torr), the device
            being open to a rotary pump manifold in the first instance
            and sealed from the pump, in the second case. Despite the
            lower vacuum, the higher pulse frequency (32 vs 5 PPS) and
            breakeven efficiency (906% vs 289%) registered by run 8 when
            compared to run 7, are a consequence of the method of run 8,
            which was interrupted systematically by 5 passive cooling
            periods, as in the case of run 2, whereas run 7 was
            continuous. This again resulted in higher average PAGD
            frequencies (at lower pressures), a predicted two-fold
            greater gain and a predicted two-fold smaller loss (columns
            13 and 14) for run 8. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 13 shows curves representing the slopes
            of the open circuit relaxation voltages, which are linear
            with the log of time elapsed from cessation of discharge,
            for both drive and charge packs, in the same run 8 set out
            in Table 5. The experiment in its entirety consisted of
            preliminary resistor-loaded measurement discharges and their
            corresponding open circuit voltages from the moment of
            cessation of the resistive discharge (illustrated,
            respectively, by the open squares of DPT1 for drive pack
            relaxation time 1, and by the open circles of CPT1 for
            charge pack relaxation time 1), followed by their relaxation
            rates in the wake of the PAGD production (the hatched
            squares of DPT2 for drive pack relaxation time 2, and the
            hatched circles of CPT2 for charge pack relaxation time 2),
            and finally, by the relaxation rates from the final
            resistor-loaded measurement discharges (the black squares of
            DPT3 for drive pack relaxation time 3, and the black circles
            of CPT3 for charge pack relaxation time 3). Discharge
            resistances were 833 ohms for the charge pack, and 2083 ohms
            for the drive pack in all cases, corresponding to resistors
            R3 and R2, respectively, of FIG. 9. This methodology will be
            examined in greater detail below. It is apparent that, after
            every load period, be this resistive (CPT1, DPT1, CPT3 and
            DPT3) or due to PAGD operation (DPT2), the relaxation slope
            is positive; as shown from slopes CPT1 and DPT1, the log
            time proportionality of the open circuit voltage relaxation,
            under these conditions, tends to plateau after .sup..about.
            30 minutes. The exception to this general behaviour lies in
            the voltage relaxation slope CPT2, which is negative and
            reflects the charge accumulation occurring in the charge
            pack and obtained by capture of energy produced during PAGD
            operation, triggered by the energy drawn from the drive pack
            during load time 2. </p>
          <p align="left">As a first approximation of electrical power
            generated and consumed by the energy conversion system of
            the invention, the previous open circuit voltage method is
            of significance in showing the basic trends involved in
            interaction of the operating parameters. However, in all
            likelihood, it overestimates the actual values of electrical
            power consumed and generated, for a variety of reasons.
            First, it assumes that the relative capacity scale of the
            batteries in the drive and charge packs is an absolute
            charge capacity scale with an invariant maximal charge
            retention, which it is not; in fact, the absolute charge
            capacity is itself a variable subject to several factors,
            such as the cycle life, overcharging or undercharged
            conditions, cell age, residual memory and the rate of charge
            and discharge. Hence, the inference of a uniform time scale
            on the basis of the open circuit voltage/capacity intercepts
            may not be warranted. Finally, it does not integrate the
            open voltage decrease over time, and utilizes the
            specification load current as the average current over time.
          </p>
          <p align="left">In order to obviate these problems, we
            resorted to a variety of other measurement methods. First,
            we proceeded to compare the closed circuit, preliminary,
            resistive-load discharge measurements for either charge or
            drive pack, under conditions of negligible loss of power, as
            these measurements were statistical means (n=9) taken, at
            equal intervals, during the first 90 seconds of the load
            discharge, and obtained both just before the PAGD production
            runs (but separated from each PAGD run by an open circuit
            voltage relaxation of 30 minutes) and just after the runs
            (but equally separated by a relaxation of 30 minutes). As an
            example of the data generated by such an approach, FIG. 14
            illustrates the shift of the slopes indicating marginal
            power loss for the drive pack (from the closed squares to
            the open squares) and those indicating gain of power for the
            charge pack (from the open circles to the closed circles),
            in actual total load power values. </p>
          <p align="left">Integration of these power measurements over
            the projected load discharge time, taken from the family of
            curves generated on the basis of the manufacturer's load
            voltage over discharge time specifications, led to a direct
            comparison of the new values, as shown in Table 6, with the
            values presented in Table 5, for the first three instances
            introduced. All values of Table 6 were obtained by resistive
            measurements of power that entailed a negligible power loss.
            Table 6 confirms the fundamental equivalence of runs 1
            through 3, as already seen from their corresponding analysis
            using the open voltage method (see runs 1 to 3, Table 5).
            This new power estimation method also confirms the lower
            loss encountered in run 2 utilizing interrupted PAGD
            operation. While the breakeven efficiencies sensibly doubled
            using this method, the estimates of actual electrical power
            consumption recovery decreased by a 2 to 3-fold factor. Thus
            this direct load voltage/amperage measurement method of
            estimating actual power losses or gains, is a check upon the
            open voltage method previously utilized. </p>
          <p align="left">Direct, instantaneous measurements of the
            voltage and current characteristics of the PAGD production
            and capture phenomena being discussed, were also performed
            during PAGD runs for diverse sets of conditions, including
            all those described in the two previous sections. In Table 7
            we show these results for two PAGD generators having an
            identical electrode area (128 cm.sup.2) and connected to
            electrical energy capture circuits of three separate
            configurations as set forth in FIGS. 10A, 10B and 10C and
            column 2, Table 7. In the configuration of FIG. 10C, or
            double diode configuration, both electrode plates act as
            cathodes and the axial member as the anode collector
            (experiments 1-4, for the H220 device and 13-14, Table 7,
            for the H34 device). In the configuration of FIG. 10B, or
            triode configuration, one plate acts as the cathode, the
            axial member as an auxiliary cathode and the other plate as
            a collector (experiments 5-9, Table 7). In the configuration
            of FIG. 10A or single (plate to plate) diode configuration,
            the axial member is disconnected, and the polarity of the
            plates remain as in the triode configuration (experiments
            10-12). All measurements were taken after 1 minute of PAGD
            operation of the devices, which were, at the start of each
            run, at room temperature. All cathodes had been previously
            broken in with &gt;2*10.sup.6 AGD pulses. The open circuit
            voltage of the charge pack was, for all cases, at 359 to 365
            volts, before each test. The direct measurements of the PAGD
            input and output DC voltages and currents were obtained as
            statistical means of 10 second long measurements, and at no
            time did the standard error of the plate voltage mean exceed
            35 volts. </p>
          <p align="left">The air pressure within the tube during these
            tests is shown in column 3, Table 7, the drive pack DC
            voltage (X), in column 5, the DC voltage across the plates
            (Y), in column 6, the drive pack output current (PAGD input
            current), in column 7, and the drive pack total watts output
            is shown in column 8. Columns 9 and 10 show the PAGD voltage
            (PAGD V=(X-Y)/I.sub.av) and the value of the PAGD extinction
            potential in V/cm. The recovery co-ordinates (ie the PAGD
            output energy) found at the U1-U2 output (FIG. 9), are shown
            in columns 11 to 13, as the charge pack's E1-E2 input DC
            voltage, amperage and power watts, respectively. The
            calculated resistance of the entire circuit is given in
            column 14, the registered PAGD frequencies in column 16, and
            running conditions in columns 17 to 18. The breakeven
            efficiency obtained by direct comparison of the electrical
            power figures for the drive and charge packs, respectively,
            is given in column 15. This assumes, for purposes of a
            generalization of power production rates over time, that the
            quasi-instantaneous, direct measurements here obtained can
            be translated to outputs obtained per unit time, and thus
            into direct Watt-hour measurements. </p>
          <p align="left">Data from runs 1 through 4 demonstrate that,
            at these PAGD frequencies, there is no difference between
            using fast switching (32 nanoseconds) MUR 860 diodes, or
            regular 40HFR-120 silicon diodes, in the rectification
            bridge of the electrical energy capture circuit, and that
            the PAGD frequency varies as a function of decreasing air
            pressure. </p>
          <p align="left">Runs 5 to 14 show that, in general, for the
            same tube, the single and double diode configurations are
            the most efficient, for the same pressure, the diode
            configuration typically yields .about.1.5-2x larger
            breakeven efficiencies (cp runs 10-11 and 13-14, with runs
            5-9, Table 7). The largest accumulations of power are also
            registered in the diode mode(s). This trend appears to be a
            function of the much lower cathodic work-function of the
            aluminum plates, than of the tungsten of the axial member
            utilized as an auxiliary cathode in the triode
            configuration. A feature of the data from these 14 different
            runs is the consistent excess power outputs (column 15,
            Table 7) and their narrower range (218 to 563%), when
            compared to those observed with the previous two methods of
            experimental analysis. </p>
          <p align="left">Run 12, Table 7, shows that the switching on
            of the electromechanical arm can be performed without
            entailing a power loss in the PAGD capture circuit, as
            previously found for run 5, Table 5, utilizing the open
            circuit voltage method. In fact, with C4=8 .mu.F and R4=500
            ohms, the AC induction motor behaves as an electrical
            flywheel (eg. 2800-3000 rpm for 10 PPS inputs), while the
            electrical energy capture circuit still registers a sizeable
            excess electrical power production (compare runs 11 and 12,
            Table 7). Runs 13 and 14 illustrate how the charge pack's
            state of charge and its inherent capacitance affects both
            the PAGD frequency and the power producing efficiency of the
            entire system: as the charge pack is reduced from 29 to 19
            cells, the PAGD generator adjusts by reducing its frequency
            logarithmically and, while the charge pack input current is
            greater than before, the drive pack loss becomes still
            larger and the breakeven efficiency much lower (by &gt;1/2,
            from 563% to 228%). This is because the circuit must
            translate the naturally larger PAGD amplitude into a larger
            surplus of output current, and in this process becomes less
            efficient. </p>
          <p align="left">If the first measurement method employed (the
            open circuit method) had to make too many theoretical
            assumptions about the system's performance under load
            conditions and hence about its effective charge capacity,
            the second approach still had to suppose an invariant
            discharge time and thus an invariant absolute charge
            capacity on the part of the battery systems (charge packs)
            employed for capture which it approximated by an operation
            of integral calculus. With the third method described above,
            theoretical assumptions were avoided except that, in these
            measurements, the actual performance of a given battery in
            terms of time, time of delivery and time of capture, was
            also ignored; no account is taken of the time-dependent
            modulation of the PAGD frequency, as effected by certain of
            the parameters analyzed, namely the charge pack state of
            charge, the method of sequencing the PAGD runs (continuous
            vs interrupted) and its concomitant heating effects, and the
            state of charge (load voltage and current capacity) of the
            drive pack. A simple, non-negligible, resistive measurement
            of power lost by the drive pack, and an identically
            non-negligible measurement of the power gained by the charge
            pack, for the same experiment and the same singular time of
            PAGD production, were performed repeatedly to corroborate
            the previous three approaches. For this purpose, all
            experiments were designed as a continuous series of
            sequential phases: </p>
          <p align="left">1) before a PAGD run, a resistive discharge
            was measured across either pack over periods of 1 to 3 hours
            (utilizing the DP and CP resistances previously reported in
            the open voltage section) and followed by a 15 to 30 minute
            open circuit voltage relaxation; </p>
          <p align="left">2) then, the PAGD runs were performed, either
            continuously or as interrupted, composite sequences, and the
            corresponding open circuit relaxation voltage(s) were
            measured, after the cessation of the integral PAGD run; </p>
          <p align="left">3) finally, resistive discharge measurements,
            obtained under identical conditions to those recorded before
            the PAGD run, were carried out for either pack, followed by
            concomitant battery voltage relaxation rate measurements. </p>
          <p align="left">Under these experimental conditions, exact
            power measurements could be taken from an analysis of the
            actual battery discharge curves before and after the PAGD
            run. Based on a comparison of the curve trends of the
            pre-run resistive discharge of the drive pack with those of
            the post-run resistive discharge, the effective power drawn
            (.DELTA.E.sub.c) from the withdrawable power capacity of the
            drive pack incurred during a PAGD run, was ascertained. This
            represents the power consumption during the run, and the
            experimental value thus recorded constitutes the actual
            power figure that must be matched for breakeven () to occur.
            Hence, the breakeven value equals, by definition, the
            electrical energy input to the system. Similarly, a
            comparison of the charge pack pre-run and post-run resistive
            discharge curve trends identified the effective power
            (.DELTA.E.sub..rho.) added to the withdrawable capacity of
            the charge pack. This quantity represents the electrical
            energy recovered during the run. The relation for the two
            quantities is expressed by the breakeven efficiency (BE
            =&nbsp; %) equation: </p>
          <p align="left">%=.DELTA.E.sub..rho. /.DELTA.E.sub.c*100 </p>
          <p align="left">If the breakeven efficiency is less than
            %=100, then the apparatus registers a net loss in electrical
            energy in the CP with respect to the DP. Conversely, if
            %&gt;100, then there is a net gain in electrical energy in
            the CP, as compared to that lost in the DP. For purposes of
            this analysis, a limit to the minimum withdrawable capacity
            was placed, from experiment and in agreement with the load
            current curves of the manufacturer, at 115 W for the driver
            pack (average current of 0.250 A, minimum current of 0.230
            A), and at 90 W for the charge pack (average current of
            0.375 A, minimum current of 0.334 A), as a function of both
            their total cell size (respectively, 46:29) and the
            difference in the resistive loads employed for the discharge
            measurements. All cathodes had been broken in, as described
            before. </p>
          <p align="left">The results obtained with this fourth method,
            for six selected experiments with three diverse types of
            devices (using different electrode plate areas, gap lengths,
            and electrode work-functions), configured both in the triode
            or the (single) diode (e.g. FIG. 10B) arrangements, at the
            indicated pressures, are presented in Table 8. In all cases,
            a net excess of combined battery pack charge, expressed as
            electrical watt hours, is registered (columns 8 and 10,
            Table 8) and the breakeven efficiencies are all &gt;100%
            (column 10). Experimental groups #1 and #2 again demonstrate
            that, for the same cathode, the interrupted PAGD sequence
            method of group #2 (1 minute of PAGD function, followed by a
            15 minute relaxation, and so on) yields a higher breakeven
            efficiency because of the lower losses registered with this
            minimal plate heating method (column 10, Table 8). Group #3,
            Table 8, shows that the PAGD power production efficiency is
            also higher for a lower work-function cathode material (H220
            vs H34), being subjected to PAGD auto-electronic conditions
            at a 4-fold lower pressure than the control groups #1 and
            #2; however, the lower pressure depresses the frequency and,
            together with the interrupted PAGD sequencing method, it
            also lowers the loss, causing an actually much larger
            breakeven value than registered for the previous two groups.
            Groups #4 and 5 exemplify the dual effect of lowering both
            the plate area and the gap distance: the former affects the
            PAGD event frequency, whereas the latter affects the PAGD
            amplitude, and thus the capture efficiency of the charge
            pack. Despite a cathodic work-function practically and
            operationally identical to that of groups #1 and 2, these
            smaller plate area and shorter gap devices utilized in
            groups #4 and 5, yield 3- to 6-fold lower net power outputs,
            as well as lower breakeven efficiencies, than the former
            groups, at the same pressure. Finally, group #6 exemplifies
            the results obtained for the plate diode configuration,
            where the frequency is lower (no triggering role for the
            axial member), and a higher loss leads to the lower
            breakeven efficiency, comparable to that of the lower area
            and shorter gap groups #4 and 5. </p>
          <p align="left">In order to verify the discharge curve lengths
            employed in these analyses and experimentally establish the
            actual charge capacity of the battery packs, calibration
            resistive discharges, between the maximum charge state and
            the minimum limits chosen, were performed for each pack with
            their respective discharge resistances R2 and R3 (see FIG.
            9). These discharge calibration curves were plotted for half
            maximal charge values shown in FIGS. 15A and 15B, and from
            the curve produced, we have determined the total half-charge
            capacities of each battery pack to be 1.033 kWh (100% =
            2.066 kWh) for the drive pack and 660 Wh (100% = 1.320 kWh)
            for the charge pack. Based upon the corresponding maximal
            (100%) capacity values, we determined the actual percentages
            of the relative charge capacities shown in column 5, Table
            8, which correspond to the experimental values obtained. We
            also noted that the curves plotted showed two quite distinct
            time linear slopes, the slope of the delivery of power per
            time unit steepening very markedly at the approach to the
            limits of the permissible withdrawable capacity, occurring
            at 115 W into R2, and 90 W into R3. </p>
          <p align="left">The pre-PAGD run and post-PAGD run, drive and
            charge pack discharge curves corresponding to groups #3 and
            #6, respectively for triode and plate diode configurations,
            in Table 8, are shown in FIG. 16 (drive pack) and 17 (charge
            pack), for group #3, and in FIG. 18 (drive pack) and 19
            (charge pack), for group #6. In all cases, the open symbols
            represent the pre-PAGD run discharge curves, whereas the
            closed symbols represent the post-PAGD run discharge curves.
          </p>
          <p align="left">As a further check on these values, a
            videographic, millisecond analysis of the singular power
            simultaneities occurring at both ends of the system (drive
            and charge packs) was performed for various 10 second
            samples of diverse PAGD runs. A typical example is shown in
            FIG. 20, which is a sample of the PAGD run designated as #6
            in Table 8. Whereas the drive pack DC wattage spent as input
            to PAGD production varied from 36.6 to 57.82 watts, by a
            factor of 1.6x, the DC wattage entering the charge pack as
            captured PAGD output varied more pronouncedly by a factor of
            2.7x, from 146.4 to 399.6 watts (all meters were in the same
            selected ranges of voltage and current) with the
            semi-periodic, intermittent character of each singular
            emission, though within specific, ascertainable ranges for
            both amplitude and current outputs. Assimilation of the
            singular behaviour of the PAGD in this sample, by a
            statistical treatment of its variation (n = 64), indicates
            that the operational breakeven efficiency observed during
            this sampled period lies at 485.2%.+-.18% with projected
            48.3Wh drive pack loss and 221.7Wh charge pack gain. This
            matches rather closely the observed 483% breakeven
            efficiency, and the 37.7Wh loss as well as the 182.2 kWh
            gain for the overall PAGD run reported in group#6, Table 8,
            and indicates how close are the values obtained by the
            operational and extensive non-negligible resistive discharge
            power measurement methods employed. </p>
          <p align="left">Finally, an example of the correlation between
            the drive pack PAGD load voltage and the charge pack PAGD
            charging voltage, as a function of the duration of the
            intervening PAGD run between resistive discharge
            measurements, is shown in FIG. 21, for the PAGD run
            corresponding to group #4, Table 8. </p>
          <p align="left">Using the same pulse generator with H200 AL
            128 cm.sup.2 plates, in a double diode configuration, and
            the same circuit values (but with CP=23 cells), three
            experiments were conducted at different PAGD frequencies, as
            a function of varying air pressure. Analysis of driver pack
            losses and charge pack gains by the extensive load discharge
            measurement method, as described before, led to the
            determination of the gross and net gains (respectively,
            without and with losses included) per pulse, in
            milliwatt-hour, for each frequency, as well as of the gross
            and net power gains per second of PAGD operation. The
            results are shown in Table 9. Even though the gross and net
            gains of power per pulse were observed to increase with
            decreasing frequency, the gross power gain per unit time
            increased with increasing frequency. However, this last
            trend does not necessarily translate into a higher net gain
            per unit time, because the losses in the driver pack (not
            shown) also increase significantly with PAGD frequency.
            These losses are in all probability related to more energy
            retention by the plasma at higher frequencies when plasma
            extinction becomes incomplete. We expect net gains to reach
            optimal thresholds for any given type of circuit
            configuration set of values and pulse generator dimensions.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Certain additional observations made during
            experiments with the double diode configuration of FIG. 10A
            may assist in understanding of the invention. </p>
          <p align="left">1) Replacing residual air with argon gas leads
            to higher PAGD frequencies, as noted by us when utilizing a
            128 cm.sup.2 H200 AC plate pulse generator in the double
            diode configuration (V=575). At 1 Torr, the pulsation rate
            went from 20 PPS in air to 1300-400 PPS in argon. With 29*12
            v cells in the charge pack, input currents ceased to flow
            into it. Under these conditions, the tube potential across
            the plates decreased and the drop across the input resistor
            increased. The value of E( = V/d) became smaller (gap size=3
            cm from plate to axial anode collector), as the extinction
            voltage decreased. </p>
          <p align="left">2) With frequencies of 400 PPS, the currents
            flowing into the charge pack fell to zero. Replacing a
            fast-recovery type HFR 120 (1200v, 40A) diode bridge by a
            type MUR 860 (600v, 8A) diode bridge had no effect. When the
            amplitude of plate potential oscillations falls below the
            potential of the charge pack, there is also a tendency to
            produce arc discharges. For output currents from the vacuum
            pulse generator to enter the charge pack, the number of
            cells must be reduced so that the potential of the charge
            pack is low enough to admit the transduced currents. A
            reduction from 29 to 23 cells allowed currents of 250 mA to
            enter the CP, and further reduction to 19 cells doubled
            these currents (per polarity arm). </p>
          <p align="left">3) Our observations show that it suffices
            under these conditions (CP = 19 cells) to increase the
            vacuum, so that the frequency decreases, and the plate
            potential and the charge pack input currents increase. At
            0.1 Torr, the currents reached 1A D.C. per plate, and at
            0.05 Torr, 2A D.C. </p>
          <p align="left">The interconnection between these factors
            indicates that the extinction voltage is a function of the
            PAGD frequency: the higher the PAGD frequency, the lower the
            extinction voltage, until empirical (in distinction from
            predicted) VAD field values are reached. As a consequence,
            the start voltage of the charge pack must be adjusted, by
            varying the number of cells composing it, so that it lies
            below the lowest extinction voltage of the PAGD, for any
            given geometry and gap distance. </p>
          <p align="left">Secondly, as the ion plasma is made more
            rarefied, the frequency of the emissions decreases, but the
            peak values of the output voltage and current per pulse
            increase. The slower the PAGD and the more rarefied the
            atmosphere, the higher is the output energy produced by the
            system relative to the input energy. </p>
          <p align="left">Autographic analysis of PAGD-induced cathode
            craters in H34 plates was performed, and their average inner
            diameter and maximal depth were determined. Similar studies
            were performed for PAGD-induced craters in Alzak (trade
            mark) plates. The secondary craters characteristically found
            in Alzak plates, along fracture lines irradiating from the
            main crater, are absent in H34 plates; instead, in H34
            plates, one observes a roughened surface surrounding the
            emission crater, quite distinct from the original rough
            aspect of the pulled finish of these hardened aluminum
            plates. Also unlike the Alzak main craters, the H34 craters
            often have a convex center occupied by a cooled molten metal
            droplet, whereas the Alzak craters had a concave, hollowed
            out aspect. Eventually, as the pitting resulting from PAGD
            cathodic emissions covers the entire cathode, the metallic
            surface gains a very different rough aspect from its
            original appearance. In this process, craters from earlier
            metal layers become progressively covered and eroded by
            subsequent emissions from the same cathode. Altogether
            different is the surface deposition process occurring at the
            anode; here, the surface appears to become more uniform,
            through the mirroring and possibly abrasive actions of
            cathode jets. Macroscopically, with increased periods of
            PAGD operation, the anode surface appears cleaner and more
            polished. </p>
          <p align="left">With the data obtained by the metallographic
            method of crater measurement, we estimated the volume of
            metal ejected from the cathode, by assuming that the crater
            represents a concavity analogous to a spherical segment
            having a single base (1/6.pi.*H [3r.sup.2 +H.sup.2 ], where
            H is the height of the spherical segment and r the radius of
            the sphere), while disregarding the volume of the central
            droplet leftover from the emission. The following are mean
            .+-.SEM crater diameters (D), crater depths (H) and maximum
            volumes (V) of extruded metallic material for two types of
            aluminum cathodes, Alzak and H34 hardened aluminum, subject
            to a high input current PAGD: </p>
          <p align="left">1- Alzak: D-0.028 cm.+-.0.003; H-0.002
            cm.+-.0.0002; V-6.2*10.sup.-7 cm.sup.3 ; </p>
          <p align="left">2- H34: D-0.0115 cm.+-.0.0004;
            H-0.0006.+-.0.0001; V-3.1*10.sup.-8 cm.sup.3 ; </p>
          <p align="left">Accordingly, utilizing plates composed of
            either material with 3 mm of thickness, and thus with a
            volume of 38.4 cm.sup.3 per plate and considering that only
            2/3rds of the cathode shall be used (a 2 mm layer out of the
            3 mm thickness), the total number of pulses per plate total
            (TLT) and partial (PLT) lifetimes is theoretically: </p>
          <p align="left">1- Alzak: TLT: 6.2*107 pulses; PLT:
            4.1*10.sup.7 pulses; </p>
          <p align="left">2- H34: TLT: 1.2*10.sup.9 pulses; PLT:
            8.1*10.sup.8 pulses. </p>
          <p align="left">Typically, an H34 device can produce
            .sup..about. 0.25 kWh per 10,000 pulses. The corresponding
            value for a PLT is thus a minimum of 1.0 MWh/Alzak cathode
            and of 20 MWh/H34 cathode. As the cathode for each
            combination is only 66.7% consumed, the vacuum pulse
            generator may continue to be used in a reverse
            configuration, by utilizing the other plate in turn as the
            cathode; thus, the estimated minimal values become,
            respectively, 2.0 MWh/Alzak pulse generator and 40 MWh/H34
            pulse generator. The same rationale applies for the double
            diode configuration of FIG. 10C. </p>
          <p align="left">We have created a two-ported system for the
            production of the singular discharge events which we have
            previously identified in the '863 application as an
            endogenous pulsatory abnormal glow discharge regime where
            the plasma discharge is triggered by spontaneous electronic
            emissions from the cathode. We have examined the functioning
            of this two-ported system in order to determine what were
            the electrical power input and output characteristics of a
            sustained PAGD regime. Despite the wide (10-fold) variations
            in net power and breakeven efficiencies measured by the four
            different methods employed (open voltage measurements, time
            integration of negligible power measurements, operational
            power measurements and real time non-negligible power
            measurements), all methods indicate the presence of an
            anomalous electrical transduction phenomenon within the
            vacuum pulse generator, such as can result in the production
            at the output port of electrical energy measured and
            directly captured which is greater than would be anticipated
            having regard to the electrical energy input at the input
            port. With the most accurate of the methods employed we have
            found typical PAGD power production rates of 200 Wh/hour of
            PAGD operation, and these may reach &gt;0.5 kWh/h values. </p>
          <p align="left">The discrepancies between the methods utilized
            have been extensively examined in the preceding section. Our
            systematic approach demonstrates that the most frequently
            employed method of measuring the charge capacity of
            batteries by the open voltage values is the least reliable
            approach for the determination of the actual net power lost
            or gained by the battery packs used in the system: when
            compared to all three other methods, it overestimates net
            power consumed and produced by up to 10 fold, as well as
            distorting the breakeven efficiencies, particularly at the
            extremes of operation. All this results from the grossly
            diminished (50-60% of manufacturer's theoretical estimate)
            effective charge capacity of the lead acid gel cells
            employed, as determined experimentally from FIGS. 18 and 19,
            when compared to the theoretical maximal charge capacity
            values that serve as scale for the open voltage
            measurements. In other words, the effective energy density
            of the batteries during these experiments was in fact
            approximately half of the manufacturer's estimated 30 Wh/kg.
          </p>
          <p align="left">Under these actual conditions of battery
            performance, the third and fourth methods (respectively,
            operational and real-time non-negligible power measurements)
            of power consumption and production proved to be the best
            approach to measure both PAGD electrical power input and
            output, as the results of both methods matched each other
            closely, even though the former is a statistical treatment
            of simultaneous events and the latter is a real time
            integration of their cumulative effects. The second method
            is clearly less reliable than either the third or the fourth
            methods, and this stems from the fact that the power
            consumption slopes of negligible resistive discharges not
            only are very different from the quasi-steady state
            discharge slopes (beginning at &gt;5-15 minutes) of
            extensive resistive discharges, but also their
            proportionality may not reflect the real time
            proportionality of equivalent prolonged resistive
            discharges. </p>
          <p align="left">The main advantage of the fourth method is
            that it effectively takes into account the actual time
            performance of the batteries comprised by the overall PAGD
            production and capture system we have described. As such,
            the method may have the main disadvantage of reflecting more
            the limitations of the batteries employed (their high rate
            of degradation of the absolute value of total effective
            charge capacity, and limited efficiency in retaining charge
            derived from discontinuous input pulses) than indicating the
            actual power output. There are a number of possibilities for
            fine tuning of the system introduced by the present work,
            beginning with the utilization of secondary batteries or
            other charge shortage or absorption devices that have less
            variable or more easily predictable actual charge capacity.
            In this respect, there are two major shortcomings to the
            batteries used to form the drive and charge packs; (1) their
            significant memory effect and (2) their design for constant,
            rather than discontinuous, DC charging. Recently developed
            Nickel Hydride batteries are an example of an electrostatic
            charge-storage system that lacks a substantial charge memory
            effect, and their experimental batteries are being developed
            currently for higher efficiency intermittent charging
            methods. Electrostatic charge retention systems having
            better energy densities, better charge retentivities and
            insignificant memory effects will probably be more efficient
            at capturing and holding the energy output by the circuit.
            In practical embodiments of the invention, effectiveness in
            charge utilization will be more important than
            measurability, and any device that will use the energy
            effectively whilst presenting an appropriate back EMF to the
            system may be utilized. </p>
          <p align="left">The effect of the performance characteristics
            of the drive and charge packs is only one amongst many
            parameters affecting operation of the invention. As shown by
            our extensive investigation of the diverse PAGD phenomenon
            the recovery of energy from it by electromechanical
            transduction as in the '531 application, or electrostatic
            capture as described above, the factors involved in
            modulating the frequency, amplitude and peak current
            characteristics of the PAGD regime are complex. Manipulation
            of these factors can improve electrical energy recovery, or
            reduce it or even suppress PAGD. We have so far noted
            numerous factors that affect PAGD frequency and some amongst
            those that also affect the PAGD amplitude. Aside from these
            factors, the circuit parameters of the output port portion
            of the circuit, in addition to the nature and chemical
            characteristics of the battery cells already discussed, the
            charge potential of the charge pack, the characteristics of
            the rectifiers in the recovery bridge in relation to the
            period of PAGD superesonant frequencies, and the effective
            values of the parallel and transversal capacitance bridges
            can all influence the results achieved. Certain factors
            however have a radical effect on PAGD operation, such as the
            gap distance and the charge pack potential. Too small a gap
            distance between the cold emitter (cathode) and the
            collector will result in an increasing reduction in energy
            recovery. The potential presented by the charge pack must be
            less than the voltage amplitude developed by the PAGD, as
            specified by a given gap distance at a given pressure. Too
            large a charge pack size with respect to PAGD amplitude and
            the gap length will preclude PAGD production or result in
            extremely low PAGD frequencies. In brief, the energy
            absorption rate and the counter potential presented by the
            charge pack or other energy utilization device are important
            factors in the operation of the circuit as a whole, and
            should either be maintained reasonably constant, or changes
            should be compensated by changes in other operating
            parameters (as is typical of most power supply circuits). </p>
          <p align="left">Since our test results indicate that the
            electrical power output of the circuit can be greater than
            the electrical power input to the circuit, the circuit
            clearly draws on a further source of energy input. Whilst we
            do not wish to be confined to any particulary theory of
            operation, the following discussion may be helpful in
            explaining our observations. These observations have been
            discussed in some detail so that the phenomenon observed can
            be reproduced, even if the principles involved are not fully
            understood. </p>
          <p align="left">In the '863 and '531 applications we have
            identified a novel, cold-cathode regime of vacuum electrical
            discharge, which we have termed the pulsed abnormal glow
            discharge (PAGD) regime. This regime, which occupies the
            abnormal glow discharge region of the volt-ampere curve of
            suitable discharge tubes, has the singular property of
            spontaneously pulsing the abnormal glow discharge in a
            fashion which is endogenous to the tube and its circuit
            environment that constitutes a vacuum pulse generator
            device, when it is operated under the conditions we have
            identified. In fact, when stimulated with continuous direct
            current, in such conditions, such a circuit responds with
            spontaneous abnormal glow discharge pulses that enable
            effective segregation of input and output currents. We have
            demonstrated electrically, metallographically,
            oscillographically and videographically, how the pulsed
            discontinuity results from a self-limiting, autoelectronic
            cathode emission that results in repeated plasma eruptions
            from the cathode under conditions of cathode saturated
            current input. The auto-electronic triggering of the PAGD
            regime is thus akin to that of the high-field emission
            mechanism thought to be responsible for vacuum arc
            discharges (VAD regime). However, under the PAGD conditions
            we have defined, this mechanism is found to operate in the
            pre-VAD region at very low field and low input average
            direct current values, with very large interelectrode
            distances and in a self-limiting, repetitive fashion. In
            other words, the PAGD regime we have identified has mixed
            characteristics: its current versus potential (abnormal
            glow) discharge curve is not only distinct from that of a
            vacuum arc discharge, but the electrical cycle of the PAGD
            regime itself oscillates back and forth within the potential
            and current limits of the abnormal glow discharge region, as
            a function of the alternate plasma generation and collapse
            introduced by the discontinuous sequencing of the
            auto-electronic emission process. Accordingly, the
            intermittent presence of the abnormal glow, as well as the
            observed segregation of the current flows, are due to the
            diachronic operation of these spontaneous cathode emission
            foci. The micro-crater and videographic analyses of the PAGD
            have demonstrated the presence of an emission jet at the
            origin of each pulse, a phenomenon which VAD theory and
            experiment has also identified. Metallic jets originating at
            the cathode spots of VADs have been known to present
            velocities up to, and greater than 1000 m/sec. </p>
          <p align="left">In light of the above, the energy graft
            phenomenon we have isolated would have to be operated, at
            the micro-event scale, by the interactions of the cathode
            emission jet with the vortex-formed impulse-transducing
            plasma in the interelectrode space. Several aspects can be
            approached in terms of the complex series of events that
            constitute a complete cycle of operation, on a micro-scale.
            There are interactions within the cathode, interactions at
            the cathode surface, interactions between the emission jet
            and the plasma globule close to the cathode, and finally,
            interactions of the resulting electron and ion distributions
            in the interelectrode plasma, within parallel boundaries. </p>
          <p align="left">In general, in the presence of an electrical
            field, the distribution of potential near the cathode forms
            a potential barrier to the flow of electronic charge, as
            this barrier is defined by the energy that the most
            energetic electrons within the metal, the Fermi energy
            electrons, must acquire before freeing themselves from the
            cathode surface potential to originate an emission jet.
            Before any free electrons become available for conduction in
            the space adjoining the cathode, they must cross the
            boundary posed by the potential barrier. With a weak applied
            field, classical electron emission from a metal can only
            occur if an energy practically equal to the work-function of
            the metal is imparted in addition to the Fermi energy. Under
            thermionic conditions of emission, the heating of the
            cathode provides the needed energy input. However, the
            cold-cathode Fowler-Nordheim quantum-field emission theory
            predicted the existence of a finite probability for an
            electron to tunnel through the potential barrier, when the
            applied field is high. Cold-cathode electron emissions are
            thus possible, under these conditions, at practically Fermi
            energy levels, as the high field would catalyze the
            tunnelling through the potential barrier by narrowing the
            barrier width for the Fermi energy electrons. The exact
            localization of the emission would then depend on the
            randomized fluctuations of high fields at the cathode, which
            were produced by positive space charges sweeping in
            proximity to it. For most purposes, this theory has been the
            working hypothesis of the last 60 years of field emission
            studies, which have centered upon the VAD mechanism, despite
            the fact that observed field gradients are evidently
            inadequate to explain breakdown as a function of the
            theoretical high field mechanism. The Fowler-Nordheim theory
            has therefore suffered major revisions and additions, mostly
            to account for the fact that it postulates, as a condition
            for cold-cathode field emission in large area electrodes,
            the presence of enormous fields (&gt;10.sup.9 V/m) and
            extremely low work functions, neither of which are borne out
            by experimental VAD investigations. Some researchers have
            found that the breakdown responsible for the VAD field
            emission is promoted by Joule heating and vaporization of
            microscopic emitter tips, and that this requires a critical
            current density (10.sup.12 A/cm.sup.2), while others
            emphasized that this explanation and these thresholds did
            not hold for large area emitters and that a space charge
            effect of concentrating the ion distribution near the
            cathode promoted breakdown under these circumstances, when
            the field reached a critical value; large field enhancement
            factors (&gt;1000-fold) have been postulated to explain the
            discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental
            findings regarding the critical breakdown field values, and
            others have demonstrated how this critical field value
            effectively varies with work-function and electrode
            conditioning. </p>
          <p align="left">The PAGD regime and its self-extinguishing
            auto-electronic emission mechanism stands as an exception to
            the high field emission theory as it currently stands with
            all its modifications, especially given that in this
            phenomenon we are confronted.. with a cathode emission that
            spontaneously occurs across the large gaps in large plate
            area pulse generators, at very low field values (down to
            &lt;1*10.sup.4 V/m), as shown above and in the '863
            application. Moreover, a Fowler-Nordheim plot (in the form
            Log.sub.10 (I/V.sup.2) vs 1/V) of the PAGD volt-ampere
            characteristic exhibits a positive slope, rather than the
            Fowler-Nordheim negative slope characteristic of VAD field
            emission. However, current density values obtained from
            correlations of autographic analysis of the cathode with an
            analysis of event-oscillogram (peak pulse currents),
            indicate that the PAGD current density J may reach values of
            10.sup.5 to 10.sup.7 A/m.sup.2 during the emission process
            (the larger Alzak craters have an associated lower J value),
            values which, at the upper end, do not reach the 10.sup.9
            A/m.sup.2 current density threshold required by the
            Fowler-Nordheim theory. Considering these two distinct
            observations with regards to field strength and current
            density, we have to admit the existence of a low field,
            large area cold-cathode auto-electronic emission endowed
            with high current densities, which is not predicted by
            current field emission theory. </p>
          <p align="left">Unlike the typical VAD regime, the PAGD is
            neither a high frequency oscillation, nor does it occur in a
            random fashion. It constitutes a semi-regular,
            quasi-coherent, periodic energy transduction which cycles
            between cathode drop limits that are higher by a factor of
            2-15 than typical vacuum arc cathode drops. The intermittent
            cathode emission responsible for the low frequency, pulsed
            behaviour of the abnormal glow, is also self extinguishing
            and self-starting, under the conditions we have defined.
            Furthermore, we have also identified a novel and unexpected
            dependency of the periodic pulse rate upon the cathode area.
            This indicates the presence of field emission control
            parameters heretofore unsuspected. It is likely that field
            fluctuations of the polarized pre-breakdown field is
            responsible for eliciting the particular localizations of
            the auto-electronic emission foci, as well as what imparts,
            in a lens-like fashion, the distorted field energy needed
            for electron surface release. In this sense, external,
            electrical or magnetic field fluctuations (e.g. motion of
            static charges or of constant magnetic fields) induced by us
            at pre-breakdown potentials, provoked PAGD emissions and
            breakdown at these levels. </p>
          <p align="left">In general, VAD studies have shown that, for
            large area electrodes, microgeometry, adsorbed gas layers
            and gas impurity contents of the cathode play a role in
            modulating field emission. In our PAGD studies, the
            interactions at the cathode surface and across the cathode
            potential drop are clearly modulated by: (1) the nature of
            residual gases, as shown by our air vs Argon studies; (2)
            their pressure, (3) electrode conditioning, (4)
            work-function and (5) cumulative pulse count, amongst
            others. </p>
          <p align="left">The plasma, in leak-controlled or low pressure
            PAGD devices, has both residual gas and metallic vapor
            substrates. In devices initially closed at high to very high
            vacua (diffusion pump pressures), the major residual
            substrate, whose presence increases with time of operation,
            is the metallic vapor released from the cathode and not
            impacted onto the envelope walls or the anode. It has been
            previously shown for externally (magnetically or
            electrostatically) pulsed plasma accelerators, that the
            amount of residual gas or vapor left in the interelectrode
            space diminishes with increasing number of consecutive
            discharges and a growing amount of electrode-insulator
            absorption of gas. The effect of such removal of residual
            gas or vapor is to decrease the vacuum of a sealed envelope.
            With high vacuum sealed PAGD generators we have observed
            that prolonged operation and sputter-induced mirroring of
            the envelope causes a progressive disappearance of the
            discharge, as the voltage potential needed to trigger it
            also increases. At the thermocouple, low frequency pulsed
            abnormal glow discharges can also be seen to increase the
            vacuum significantly. These results suggest instead the
            presence of a pumping mechanism in the PAGD which is
            somewhat analogous to that of sputter ion pumps, where
            collision of ionized gas molecules with the cathode is
            responsible for the sputtering of cathode material that
            either combines with the gas substrate (`gettering` action)
            or `plasters over` the inert gas molecules onto the anode (a
            process known as `ion burial`). These are the two basic
            pressure reducing actions of sputtered getter atoms, in ion
            pumps. However, in ion sputter pumps, the initiation of the
            cycle is a function of the presence of high velocity
            electrons in the high field plasma of the glow discharge,
            which are necessary to ionize the gas substrate molecules;
            also, the getter material typically has a high work-function
            for field emission. Hence, the sputtering is due to the
            secondary impact of plasma positive ions at the cathode,
            after plasma ionization has occurred in the interelectrode
            space. Altogether different is the mechanism of spontaneous,
            primary electron emission from the cathode, which is
            characteristic of the low field PAGD: here, the sputtering
            is caused by the electronic emission itself and attendant
            metallic vaporization processes. By artificially confining
            the firing foci to a part of the cathode, we have shown in
            the single diode configuration how the PAGD induced
            sputtering is associated with the cathode autoelectronic
            emission mechanism, rather than with the abnormal cathode
            glow per se, given the localization of sputtering onto the
            emission region of the plate, despite its overall cathode
            glow saturation. </p>
          <p align="left">These observations would thus seem to
            corroborate the hypothesis of a progressive vacuum increase
            with the cumulative number of emitted pulses, were it not
            for the fact that experiments performed with leak controlled
            devices (reported here and in previous studies) show that,
            when the negative pressure is maintained by balanced leak
            admission of air or argon, pulse rates still decrease with
            cumulative pulse count, and do so neither as a function of
            an increase in vacuum, nor as a function of envelope
            mirroring (unless this is so extensive as to establish
            envelope conduction), but rather as a function of processes
            (generally referred to as conditioning) inherent to the
            electrodes, specifically, to the cathode. We have further
            shown that, for such altered emitter states, the pressure of
            the vessel must be increased, not because of an increasing
            vacuum (precluded by the controlled gas leak), but because
            of the effect that residual gases may have in modulating the
            low field PAGD emission. </p>
          <p align="left">PAGD electrode conditioning is a
            cathode-dominant process resulting from the cumulative
            emission of high numbers of pulses by a cathode, and has
            been shown to be a factor independent of the nature and
            pressure of the residual gas and partially reversible only
            by operation with reversed plate polarity, unlike reports of
            copper cathode-dominant conditioning. It is thought that
            electrode conditioning and the accompanying increase in VAD
            breakdown potential are due to the progressive adsorption of
            residual gases, though cathode-dominant conditioning
            processes, such as subjecting the vacuum gap to consecutive
            discharges, have been shown to correlate the decrease in
            plasma impulse strength with electrode outgassing of
            absorbed or adsorbed gases. Moreover, given the pitting
            action of crater formation at the cathode by the PAGD
            regime, and, as we shall see below, the metallic plating of
            the anode, the PAGD cathode-dominant process of conditioning
            we have observed with respect to decreased pulse frequency
            and increase in potential, suggests that the apparent
            increase in cathode work function is not due to gas
            adsorption or absorption. These processes are more likely to
            occur on the plated anode. It is likely that, given the
            observed PAGD pressure reducing effect caused by the
            cathodic jet, a certain outgassing of the cathode is in fact
            occurring during PAGD function. One might also expect that
            the anode, if plated by sputtering atoms, would increase its
            gas content in the formed surface film. However, controlled
            leak experiments suggest instead that some other type of
            alteration of the cathode work function is occurring, which
            is, as we shall examine below, independent of the adsorbed
            gas state of the electrodes, as well as independent of the
            PAGD ion pump-like effect. Nonetheless, even at the level of
            the anode, the PAGD sputtering action may have contradictory
            effects: it may impact interelectrode gap molecules onto the
            collector, as well as release, by ionic bombardment and
            vaporization, gases adsorbed to, or contaminating the anode.
            If we assume that gas adsorption by impact on the collector
            is the predominant mechanism, one could explain the increase
            in the number of breakdown sites per unit time, as observed
            by us for a re-reversed cathode, if the number of PAGD
            breakdown sites depended on the quantity of adsorbed gases,
            eg oxygen, on the cathode being tested. Recovery of the
            cathode work-function would depend on the electronic charge
            recovery of the positively charged, adsorbed or occluded gas
            layer at the cathode- either by reversal or as a function of
            time of inactivity. The surface film theory of `electrical
            double layer formation at the cathode` in fact contended
            that, low field flash over is a photocathodic effect
            dependent upon the presence of a glowingly positively
            polarized gaseous film at the cathode; this film would lower
            the cathode emissivity by decreasing the field between the
            cathode surface and the leading edge of the cathode glow,
            across the cathode drop. However, even though the surface
            film theory of `electrical double layer formation at the
            cathode` predicts the lowering of the emission breakdown
            potential and the increase in flash over rate when the
            electrodes are reversed--as the anode would have acquired a
            surface charge capable of affecting the breakdown potential,
            it acknowledges nevertheless, that the anodic surface charge
            hardly explains the observed intensity of the polarization
            effects. Moreover non-reversed, conditioned cathodes
            retained their lower PAGD frequencies in a time independent
            manner, for as long as reversal was avoided (excluding a
            PAGD frequency recovery effect due to plate cooling, which
            may be as short as 15 minutes). PAGD conditioning was
            independent of idle time and increased with cumulative pulse
            count. Moreover, the AGD pulses are not UV photocathodic
            Townsend discharges, liberating secondary electrons via
            positive ion impact at the cathode. Nor could photocathodic
            emissions generate currents of the magnitude observed in the
            PAGD. Lastly, the PAGD discharge and breakdown thresholds
            appear to be unaffected by UV, though they may be somewhat
            depressed by visible light, and the emission mechanism in
            the PAGD is the primary process. </p>
          <p align="left">Removal or flattening of protuberances and
            tips from the emitting cathode by the action of the
            discharge, is a process also thought to play a role in
            hardening the cathode or increasing its field emission
            work-function. However, this explanation may not be adequate
            for the PAGD emission process, if we consider our
            metallographic findings of a smoothing action of the
            discharge at the collector. In fact, it would appear that
            the flattened, smoother, plated, mirrored and cleaner
            surfaces subjected to PAGD bombardment are the explanation
            for the observed increased emission ability of re-reversed
            cathodes: mirrored Alzak surfaces emit at higher frequencies
            than do dull H34 and H220 surfaces; new, polished surfaces
            emit at a higher frequency than do pitted, broken in
            surfaces; anode surfaces, never before utilized as cathodes
            but subjected to prolonged PAGD action, emit at higher
            frequencies when employed as cathodes, than do new,
            identical cathode surfaces; and ex-cathodes, employed for
            prolonged periods as anodes, regain a higher emission
            frequency upon re-use as cathodes. The better PAGD emission
            performance of smoother cathodes, compared with the worse
            VAD emission performance of the same, when pitted cathodes
            (lacking protuberances) are used, requires explanation. </p>
          <p align="left">Rakhovsky has put forth a VAD model for
            cathode spots, that distinguishes between Type I spots
            (quickly moving spots, far from steady state and responsible
            for crater formation), and Type II spots (quasi-stationary
            and near steady-state, but leaving an itinerant track with
            no sign of crater formation). Whereas the former would obey
            the Fowler-Nordheim requirement for high fields
            (&gt;10.sup.9 V/m), the latter could hardly be expected to
            do so with typical arc voltage drops in the order of 10 V.
            Once again, autographic analysis of the PAGD emission aspect
            indicates mixed characteristics: the PAGD cathode spot is a
            hybrid. It behaves as an intermittent instability that
            leaves single (e.g. in H34) or clustered (e.g. in Alzak)
            craters, which are both qualities of Type I cathode spots;
            and it exists under low field conditions (&lt;10.sup.5 V/m),
            with cathode drops of 20 to 150 V, in a quasi-coherent mode,
            leaving an itinerant track of successive craters when
            operating at the higher frequencies, all of which are
            properties approaching those of a VAD Type II cathode spot.
            Furthermore, the macroscopically visible metal sputtering
            (due to the explosive action of the PAGD emission
            phenomenon) occurring at the upper end of the permissible DC
            current input scale, and the presence of large solidified
            molten metal droplets in and around the craters, suggest
            models which have been proposed for explosive electronic
            emission. Explosion models propose that the creation of a
            residual plasma ball in front of a microprotuberance
            provokes the large potential drop at the prospective
            emission focus and sufficiently high resistive and
            Nottingham heating to reach &gt;10.sup.7 A/cm.sup.2 current
            densities during the explosive consumption of these
            microemitters. Whether the explosive action associated with
            cathode spots is an auxiliary effect that applies solely to
            the vaporization of the emitting microprotrusion, or an
            integral emission and vaporization explosive process, it
            does not appear that it can be restricted to high-field VAD
            Type II cathode spots, given that it can be equally made to
            occur with the low field PAGD hybrid cathode spot, and be
            macroscopically observed. Indeed, in the plate diode
            configuration, it is easy to visualize the metallic particle
            explosions that surround and accompany the plasma jets, near
            to upper current limit conditions. However, if we are to
            assume that any of these models apply to the emission
            mechanism, we would, in all likelihood, have to conclude
            that the PAGD initial emission sites must be submicroscopic
            (100 to 10 nm), rather than microscopic. Resolution limits
            to our own metallographic examination of the smoothing
            action of the PAGD discharge on the collector would thus
            have precluded us from detecting formation of such
            submicroscopic protrusions, as well as their presence in a
            `soft` cathode- and thus infer their disappearance from a
            pitted, hardened cathode; but if the disappearance of such
            submicroprotuberances were responsible for the observed
            alteration of cathode work function, one would also thereby
            have to postulate the existence of a mechanism for
            microroughness regeneration (eg. tip growth) at the anode,
            in order to explain the observed increased emission upon
            cathode re-reversal. Furthermore, this regeneration would
            have to be actively promoted by operation with reversed
            polarity, and this is problematic. Focusing of the distorted
            or magnified field upon alumina inclusions on pure iron
            electrodes has been demonstrated to degrade breakdown
            voltage for field emission, but the effect was greater for
            larger microscopic particles. If we were to apply this
            concept to our work, it would require the existence of
            unmistakably abundant microscopic heterogeneities in the
            quasi-homogeneous electrode surfaces employed, which we did
            not observe; on the contrary, their absence suggests that
            either the microroughness responsible for the low field PAGD
            emission is submicroscopic, or that the field distortion
            responsible for eliciting the PAGD is independent of the
            presence of these protuberances. This last possibility must
            be taken all the more seriously, in light of the fact that
            PAGD functioning is able to cover with craters the entire
            surface of an emitter. </p>
          <p align="left">Whereas the discharge potentials observed in
            the PAGD have been shown to be relatively independent of the
            kind of gas present, there is a gas effect in the PAGD
            phenomenon, particularly in what concerns its frequency,
            observed when the same `run down` cathode was capable of
            much higher emission rates when exposed to argon, than to
            air. Utilizing the technique of bias sputtering, it has been
            demonstrated that the number of charge symmetric collisions
            (dependent upon sheath thickness d and the ion mean free
            path) in the plasma sheath, which are responsible for lower
            energy secondary peaks in ion energy distribution N(E), at
            pressures of 0.2 Torr, is substantially greater in argon
            than in argon-nitrogen mixtures, and thus that, under these
            conditions, mostly Ar.sup.+ and Ar.sup.++ ions impact the
            negatively biased electrode. In non-equilibrium RF
            discharges, greater ion densities have also been attained
            with argon, than with air. With respect to field emissions,
            one would expect a gas effect only with regards to changes
            on surface conditions, though such studies have shown
            contradictory effects of argon upon cathode work function.
            In light of the foregoing, and given that the PAGD is an
            emission discharge and not a sputtering discharge per se, in
            the strict sense, we can conceive of the role of inert gas
            atoms in increasing, as compared to air or nitrogen, the ion
            energy density distribution at the PAGD cathode spot
            interface with the cathode surface emitter, and thus elicit
            increased emission rates from the cathode, by pulling
            electrons from the metal via the field effect. While this is
            consistent with the concept of focused distortions of
            space-charge field fluctuations inducing localization of the
            emission foci, the argon effect can be observed in the PAGD
            regime over the entire range of the Paschen low vacuum
            curve, and into Cooke's mid to high vacuum curve, at low
            fields and without negative biasing. Thus, it is not simply
            a high pressure (nor a gas conditioning) effect, even if the
            gas effect in question applies to the description of a local
            pressure rise at the emission site/cathode spot interface,
            which may play a role in enhancing the local field. </p>
          <p align="left">Considered together, the PAGD emission-derived
            sputtering, the observed metallic plating of the anode and
            the explosive aspect of the discharge, suggest the presence
            of a jet of metallic vapor present in the discharge and
            running, contrary to the normal flow of positive ions, from
            the cathode to the anode. This jet appears to have
            properties similar to the high speed vapor ejected from the
            cathode in a VAD, as first detected by Tanberg with his
            field emission pendulum (Tanberg, R. (1930), "On the cathode
            of an arc drawn in vacuum", Phys. Rev., 35:1080) In fact,
            the VAD high field emission process is known to release,
            from the cathode spot, neutral atoms with energies much
            greater than the thermal energy of the emission discharge.
            This anomalous phenomenon brings into play the role of the
            reported cathode reaction forces detected in vacuum arc
            discharges (Tanberg, as above, also Kobel, E. (1930),
            "Pressure and high vapour jets at the cathodes of a mercury
            vacuum arc", Phys. Rev., 36:1636), which were thought to be
            due to the counterflow of neutral metallic atoms, from the
            cathode onto the anode (charged metallic ions are normally
            expected to target the cathode). In absolute units of
            current, this current quadrature phenomenon has been shown
            to reach, in the VAD regime, proportions of the order of
            100*I.sup.2 (see also the Aspden papers referenced below).
            Early interpretations attributed this to the cathode
            rebounding of &lt;2% of gas substrate-derived plasma
            positive ions hitting the cathode and being charge
            neutralized in the process, but having kept most of their
            thermal energy. Tanberg held instead that the counterflow of
            neutral particles responsible for the cathode reaction force
            was cathode derived, effectively, that it constituted a
            longitudinal interaction acting in the direction of the
            metallic arc jet. However, even though secondary high energy
            distributions of neutral atoms emanating from the cathode do
            not have thermal energies, their modal distribution does
            (Davis, W. D. and Miller, H. C. (1969) J. Appl. Phys.,
            40:2212) furthermore, the major anomalous atomic counterflow
            that accompanies the high energy electron flow toward the
            anode, was shown mass spectrographically to consist
            predominantly of multiply ionized, positively charged ions
            of cathode metal, rather than neutral atoms. If this made it
            easier to abandon the primacy of the rebounding model, it
            was now more difficult for field emission theorists to
            accept and explain the observed high energies (ion voltages
            in excess of the discharge voltage drops) and the high
            ionization multiplicity associated with these counterflowing
            positive ions. This field of investigation has indeed been
            one of the mounting sources of evidence suggesting that
            there is something amiss in the present laws of
            electrodynamics. The anomalous acceleration of
            counterflowing ions, and the energy transfer mechanisms
            between high speed or `relativistic` electrons and ions in a
            plasma (Sethion, J. D. et al, "Anomalous Electron-Ion Energy
            Transfer in a Relativistic-Electron-Beam-Heated Plasma"
            Phys. Rev. Letters, Vol. 40, No. 7, pages 451-454), in these
            and other experiments, has been brilliantly addressed by the
            theory of the British physicist and mathematician, H.
            Aspden, who first proposed a novel formulation of the
            general law of electrodynamics capable of accounting for the
            effect of the mass ratio factor (M/m') in the parallel (and
            reverse) motion of charges with different masses, (Aspden,
            H. (1969) "The law of electrodynamics", J. Franklin Inst.,
            287:179; Aspden, H (1980) "Physics Unified", Sabberton
            Publications, Southampton, England). The anomalous forces
            acting on the counterflowing metallic ions would stem from
            their out of balance interaction with the emitted high speed
            electrons, as predicated by the electrodynamic importance of
            their mass differential. This results in a fundamental
            asymmetry of the plasma flow between electrodes, localized
            onto the discontinuous interfaces of the plasma with the
            electrodes, namely, in the cathode dark space and in the
            anodic sheath: on the cathode side, electrons act upon ions,
            as the emitted electrons having less than zero initial
            velocities, drift against the incoming ion flux and in
            parallel with the ion and neutral counterflows; on the anode
            side of the discharge, positive ions flowing toward the
            cathode confront mainly the incoming counterflow of positive
            ions and neutral atoms, as the high speed electrons have
            abnormally transferred their energy to counterflowing, high
            speed, cathodic metal ions. An out of balance reaction force
            thus results at the cathode, to which the leaving metallic
            atoms impart a force of equal momentum but opposite
            direction, a force which is added to the cathode momentum
            generated by impacting, normal flowing positive ions.
            Moreover, Aspden confirmed theoretically the fundamental
            contention of Tanberg's experimental findings that an
            electrodynamic force will manifest itself along the
            direction of the discharge current flow, and thus, that the
            atomic counterflow is a metallic jet. Aspden further
            demonstrated that this asymmetry of plasma discharges does
            not imply any violation of the principles of conservation of
            energy and charge equivalence, given that there will be no
            out-of-balance force when such anomalous forces are
            considered in the context of the whole system of charge
            which must, perforce, include the local electromagnetic
            frame itself. Such discharges must be viewed as open energy
            systems, in balance with their electromagnetic environment:
            their apparatuses may constitute materially closed or
            limited systems, but they are physically and energetically
            open systems. Current work on Aspden's formulation of
            Ampere's Law indicates that both classical electromagnetism
            and special relativity ignore precisely, in circuits or in
            plasma, the longitudinal interactions that coexist with
            transverse ones. Standing longitudinal pressure waves, of a
            non-electromagnetic nature, have been previously shown in
            plasma electrons, which did not conform to the Bohm and
            Gross plasma oscillation mechanism (Pappas, P. T. (1983)
            "The original Ampere force and Bio-Savart and Lorentz
            forces", I1 Nuovo Cimento, 76B:189; Looney, D. H. and Brown,
            S. C. (1954) "The excitation of plasma oscillations" Phys.
            Rev. 93:965) </p>
          <p align="left">The present theoretical approach to the novel
            regime of electrical discharge which we have isolated in
            specially designed devices, and to its mixed glow-arc
            characteristics, suggests that a similar, out-of balance
            current quadrature phenomenon occurs in the discharge plasma
            during the low field, autoelectronic emission-triggered
            PAGD, and is responsible for the observed surplus of energy
            in the experimental system described in this report.
            Clearly, all the evidence we have adduced indicates that
            there is a powerful longitudinal component to the
            emission-triggered PAGD, ie that the discharge pulses
            characteristic of this pre-VAD regime are longitudinally
            propelled jets of cathode-ejected high speed electrons and
            high speed ions. We have performed experiments, in the PAGD
            regime of operation, with very thin axial members that bend
            easily when placed in the path of the discharge, or with
            Crooke radiometer-type paddle-wheels, and both show the
            presence of a net longitudinal force in the plasma discharge
            acting in the direction of the anode, which confirms the
            magnitude of the atomic counterflow (ionized and neutral)
            present during the PAGD, very much like Tanberg's pendulum
            did for the VAD. These observations also tally with the
            explosive action of the emission mechanism, such as we have
            examined it above. In this context, two aspects of the PAGD
            are remarkable: the fact that a phenomenon akin to field
            emission occurs at low field values, for large area
            electrodes across large gaps, and the conclusion that the
            PAGD must deploy an excessively large counterflow of, in all
            probability, both ionized and neutral cathodic particles.
            The observation of ion current contributions to the cathode
            current on the order of 8 to 10%, in VADs, can hardly apply
            to the PAGD mechanism responsible for the anomalous currents
            and counterflows observed. Hence, we should further expect
            that the characteristically intermittent, or chopped current
            regime of the PAGD, is a major factor in the generation of
            disproportionately high energy longitudinal pulses and in
            allowing our system to capture most of the electrical energy
            output from the device. In all probability, field collapse
            at the end of discharge favours the nearly integral
            collection of the plasma charge, and ensures the
            transduction of most of the plasma energy of the pulse
            (blocked, as it is, from flowing back through the input port
            to the drive pack) to the output port, through the parallel,
            asymmetric capacitance bridge that interfaces with the
            charge recovery reservoir (the charge pack). Collapse of the
            field of the discharge may also be a contributing factor to
            the anomalous acceleration of ions, and to the observed
            anode plating effect. It is equally possible that such
            abnormally large longitudinal pulses may never be
            observable, for a given arrangement and scale, above
            threshold frequencies of the oscillation; we have, in this
            sense, presented data that indicates that for a given
            geometry, above specific PAGD frequencies, the capture of
            surplus energy decreases steadily in efficiency until it
            ceases altogether, for a given arrangement. The point at
            which this surplus begins to decrease coincides with the
            setting in of frequency-dependent irregularities in the
            discharge sequence and, most importantly, it coincides with
            a reduction of the peak pulse current for each PAGD pulse.
            We have further remarked that increasing the PAGD frequency
            above the zero surplus point, for a given arrangement, by
            manipulating any of the frequency control parameters,
            provokes the slippage of the PAGD into a full fledged VAD
            regime, while input currents greatly increase and output
            peak currents greatly decrease (to comparable peak input
            levels of 10 to 15A). The transition between the two modes
            of emission-triggered discharge, PAGD and VAD, thus appears
            to be tied in to adjustable thresholds in the frequency of
            the emission discontinuities; in this sense, it is rather
            likely that the plasma field collapse plays a major role in
            regularizing and optimizing the anomalous energies of field
            emissions, as in the PAGD regime. At low frequencies of low
            field emission, the emission regime is highly discontinuous,
            diachronic and regular, for it has time to fully extinguish
            the discharge; hence the PAGD singularity, in which the
            phases of each discharge pulse are well defined and
            sequential. Above a given high frequency, when ion and
            electron recombination will happen more often, before each
            can be collected at the electrodes, the stream of emitted
            discontinuities merges into a noisy, randomized continuum,
            where simultaneous emissions become possible and the plasma
            field no longer has time to collapse and fully resolve the
            longitudinal pulses. Any anomalous energy generated is then
            minimized and trapped in the plasma body and, in these
            conditions, the VAD regime eventually sets in. Such model
            would easily explain why the high field VAD experiments
            performed to date have never detected such extraordinarily
            large anomalous forces. </p>
          <p align="left">On the other hand, the quasi-coherent aspect
            of the discharge suggests that the vacuum gap, in
            functioning during the PAGD regime both as an insulator and
            as a conductor with capacitative and self-inductive
            properties, is periodically altered by large and intense
            polarizations which are resolved by the discrete emission of
            longitudinal pulses from the cathode. It is possible that
            these nonlinear oscillations resulting from sudden
            depolarization of the vacuum gap by high speed explosive
            emissions elicited at the convection focus of the distorted
            field, might be in resonance or near resonance with the
            external circuitry, but the most apparent effect of
            increasing the capacitance in all bridge members is to
            increase the jet current and the transduced current flowing
            into the charge pack. The PAGD amplitude variation also
            presents, after the large negative discontinuity, a growing
            oscillation at very high resonant frequencies, which are
            typical of inductive chopping currents in a VAD, before
            extinction occurs. Unlike the VAD inductive case, in the
            absence of any coils other than the wire wound resistors,
            the PAGD relaxation oscillations which follow each pulse
            only extinguish the discharge when the voltage potential of
            the amplitude curve rises above the applied voltage, just as
            the plasma potential drops the most. Given the entirely
            non-inductive nature of the external circuit utilized in
            many instances, the inductive properties in evidence are
            those of the vacuum device itself. It also suggests that, in
            the absence of any need of an applied external magnetic
            field for the PAGD discharge to occur coherently, it is
            possible that the magnitude of the currents generated
            produces by itself a significant self-magnetic field. Thus,
            we cannot rule out the possibility of a self-organization of
            the plasma discharge, which may, in Prigogine's sense,
            constitute a dissipative structure (Prigogine, I. and
            George, C. (1977), "New quantization rules for dissipative
            systems", Int. J. Quantum Chem., 12 (Suppl.1):177). Such
            self-ordering of the PAGD plasma jet is suggested by the
            experimentally observed transition of these pulses from the
            current saturated limit of the normal glow discharge region,
            into the PAGD regime, as a function of increasing current:
            smaller foci of discharge can be seen to discontinuously
            agglutinate into larger emission cones, or into jets with a
            vortex-like appearance, when the input current reaches a
            given threshold. It is possible that, under these
            conditions, the distribution of the charge carriers and
            their sudden fluctuations may render any steady state plasma
            boundary conditions ineffective and provoke a singularity in
            the discharge mechanism; this nonlinear behaviour, together
            with any self-magnetic effects, might provide radial
            coherence of the plasma flow along the longitudinal path of
            the discharge. This concept is akin to what has been
            proposed for periodically evanescent solution structures
            referred to as instantons, that represent self-organizing
            transitions between the two states of a system. The PAGD may
            well be an instance of an instanton type structure bridging
            the open, or conductive, and the closed, or insulating,
            states of the vacuum gap. An analytical formulation of the
            problem of the plasma flow from the cathode spot to the
            anode, which would take into account the self-magnetic and
            self-organizing properties of the PAGD plasma channel, would
            be extremely difficult, given the out of balance
            longitudinal force, its abnormal energy transfer and
            associated counterflow, as well as the competition between
            collisional and inertial exchanges. </p>
          <p align="left">The plating observed at the anode most likely
            results from the impact of counterflowing ions (and possibly
            neutral atoms), whereas the pitting of the (locally molten)
            cathode results from the emission of vaporized metallic
            material and electrons, as well as, secondarily, from
            bombardment by incident positive ions. The first action
            smooths the surface by mirroring it (deposition of
            cathode-derived atoms) and abrading it, whereas the latter
            smooths it in places by rounding concavities and by forming
            molten droplets upon local cooling, while simultaneously
            roughening it on the crater peripheries. One might think
            that this cathode roughening should lower the work function
            and facilitate the discharge, but the facts indicate that
            just the opposite must be happening in view of changes in
            the PAGD according to the nature and state of the cathode
            surface. The observed alterations of electrode work function
            for PAGD low field emission must thus be related to the
            molecular and charge effects of these different actions at
            the two electrodes. It appears that for large parallel plate
            electrodes, the PAGD low field emission is modulated by the
            nature and, most likely, by the molecular structure of the
            metallic surface layer of the emitter. </p>
          <p align="left">We have thus devised a system for the capture
            as electricity of the energy of anomalously energetic
            longitudinal pulses sequentially triggered by spontaneous
            emissions of high speed electrons and ions generated from
            low work function cathodes, during the low field and
            singularly mixed PAGD regime of electrical discharge in
            vacuo. To confirm the above interpretation of the anomalous
            flux in the observed PAGD phenomenon, the cathode jet
            composition, as well as time- and usage-dependent changes
            occurring in the tubes, with diverse sealed negative
            pressures and after submission to prolonged PAGD operation,
            must be analyzed mass spectroscopically. In any event, the
            excess energy present in the anomalous counterflowing force
            appears to stem from a discharge mechanism that effectively
            pulls high speed electrons and constituent atoms out of a
            metal surface, at low fields and with high current
            densities, and is modulated by a complex multiplicity of
            parameters. The system described appears to transduce
            efficiently the observed nonlinear longitudinal pulse
            discontinuities of the plasma field, under conditions of
            current saturation of the cathode, because the
            self-extinguishing and self-limiting properties of the
            discharge allows the energy from the collapse of the
            discharge to be captured. The particular design of the
            circuitry, which couples a rectification bridge to the
            asymmetric bridge quadrature of large capacitances, placed
            at the output of the PAGD generator, permits effective
            capture. Our findings constitute striking evidence for
            Aspden's contention of a need to revise our present
            electrodynamic concepts. The dual ported PAGD discharge tube
            circuits which we have described are the first electrical
            systems we know of which permit effective exploitation of
            anomalous cathode reaction forces and allow for the recovery
            of electrical energy from systems exhibiting this effect.
            Any apparent imbalance in the electrical energy input to the
            system and withdrawn from the system by its operator must be
            considered in the context of the entire continuum in which
            the system operates, within which it is anticipated that
            accepted principles of energy balance will be maintained. </p>
          <p align="left">Moreover, the energy conversion system of the
            invention has substantial utility as an electrical inverter
            accepting direct current, and providing one or more of a
            direct current output at lower voltage and higher current,
            variable frequency input to alternating current motors, and,
            by suitable combinations of discharge tube systems, more
            flexible DC to DC conversion systems. </p>
          <p align="left">As an alternative to the batteries used in the
            experiments described, a DC power supply may be utilized or,
            more advantageously from the viewpoint of entailing less
            transformation losses, a DC generator to provide the
            electrical energy input to the system. As a DC motor can be
            run directly from the rectified output of the circuit of
            FIG. 9 at El-E2, in place of a battery charge pack, DC
            motor/generator sets of suitable characteristics (in terms
            of back E.M.F. and circuit loading) can be used to charge
            the batteries of the drive pack, utilizing the rectified
            PAGD output to drive the DC motor component of the set. This
            provides a simple, one battery pack solution, where the PAGD
            input and output circuits are electrically separated by the
            DC motor/generator interface: the drive pack is
            simultaneously being discharged to drive PAGD production,
            and charged by the DC generator output which, in turn, is
            being driven by the electromechanical transformation of the
            rectified PAGD output that would typically accrue to a
            charge pack in the experiments already described. The main
            limitations to such an arrangement lie in the efficiency of
            the motor and generator transformations utilized. </p>
          <p align="left">A pulsed DC source could be used to provide
            input to the circuit if suitably synchronized, but care is
            needed not to interfere unduly with the autoelectronic
            mechanism of the field induced cathode emissions. <br>

          <p align="left">A cold cathode vacuum discharge tube is used
            in a circuit for generating pulsed autoelectronic emissions
            which are particularly intense and frequent in the abnormal
            glow discharge region, and involve much lower current
            densities than predicted by the Fowler-Nordheim vacuum arc
            discharge region law. The discharge tube is characterized by
            a large electrode area at least of the cathode, and a large
            interelectrode gap. The electrodes are preferably spaced at
            least 2 cm apart in a parallel relationship. A probe may be
            introduced between the electrodes to reduce still further
            the field required to generate the emissions. In another
            configuration the probe forms the anode and two plates form
            cathodes. The circuit is driven from a direct current source
            of having an impedance sufficient to prevent establishment
            of a vacuum arc discharge. </p>

            triggered, will generate pulsed auto-electronic emissions in
            the abnormal glow discharge region. </p>
          <p align="left">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
          <p align="left">As the current passed through a gas discharge
            tube is increased beyond the levels at which normal glow
            discharge takes place, such normal gas discharge being
            characterized by a negative resistance characteristic
            leading to decreasing potential between the cathode and
            anode electrodes of the tube, a region of abnormal glow
            discharge is entered in which the negative resistance
            characteristic changes to a positive resistance
            characteristic leading to increasing potential between the
            elecytrodes. Typically this increased potential rapidly
            leads to breakdown into vacuum arc discharge between the
            electrodes, again characterized by a negative resistance
            characteristic. Accordingly, gas discharge tubes have been
            operated in the normal glow discharge or vacuum arc regimes
            in which stable operation can be achieved by appropriate
            ballasting of the tube, the former regime being suitable for
            low current applications and the latter for high current. It
            is possible to utilize a normal glow discharge tube in a low
            frequency oscillator circuit by placing capacitance in
            parallel with the tube and in series with the ballast
            because such a tube is characterized by a comparatively high
            striking potential at which discharge is initiated, and a
            lower but still high extinction potential at which discharge
            ceases. Operation in such a mode with vacuum arc devices is
            difficult because, in order to turn off the device
            effectively, the arc must be extinguished or otherwise
            interrupted or divested for long enough to disperse the
            intense ionization formed in its path. On the other hand,
            the current densities of normal gas discharges are too
            limited for use in applications requiring relatively large
            currents. </p>
          <p align="left">Devices operating in the vacuum arc regime
            have other problems, particularly in terms of ensuring
            adequate electrode life, which have led to gas diodes and
            triodes (thyratrons) being superseded by semiconductor
            devices in most applications. A further limitation of such
            devices is that the great difficulty in turning them off,
            except by terminating current flow through the device for a
            finite period, limits their usefulness as control devices to
            rectification, current turn-on and low frequency alternating
            current applications. </p>
          <p align="left">The only prior art of which we are aware which
            successfully exploits the abnormal glow discharge regime is
            the process described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,316 (Manuel)
            issued Oct. 7, 1969, which we understand is commercially
            utilized in forming organic coatings on metal cans. It
            relies on the application of externally generated current
            pulses to force a discharge tube temporarily into the
            abnormal glow discharge region, the pulses being
            sufficiently short that no vacuum arc is established. There
            is no disclosure of any endogenous pulsed abnormal glow
            discharge, the apparatus is dependent upon an external pulse
            generator to operate, and its utility is completely
            different from the present invention because it uses
            externally generated pulses rather than generating such
            pulses. U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,316 uses externally generated
            and limited current pulses to project operation of a
            discharge tube in a transient manner into the abnormal glow
            discharge region, thus achieving a higher average current
            density and accelerating the polymerisation process beyond
            the rate attainable using a normal glow discharge. </p>
          <p align="left">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
          <p align="left">The problems associated with the operation of
            vacuum arc devices are typically associated with the
            establishment of a continuous channel of low resistance
            ionized plasma between the electrodes of a device operating
            in this mode, accompanied by intense heating of the
            electrodes. Such a channel is difficult to interrupt in
            rapid and predictable manner once established. We have
            discovered that it is possible to set up a stable endogenous
            pulsed abnormal glow discharge regime which is characterized
            by no such continuous channel having been established, and
            predominantly cold-cathode auto-electronic field emission
            rather than thermionic emission, these characteristics
            providing the ability to control and extinguish the
            discharge readily. </p>
          <p align="left">We have found that, by use of a suitable
            design of a low pressure gas discharge tube, we can
            sufficiently inhibit transition from the abnormal glow
            discharge regime into the vacuum arc discharge regime that
            we can successfully exploit characteristics of the abnormal
            glow discharge regime to provide a device having valuable
            and controllable characteristics as a high power, pulse
            generator when fed from a current source. Such a pulse
            generator has useful applications in for example motor
            control and other applications requiring high current
            pulses. It is a valuable characteristic that the pulse
            repetition frequency can be varied over a range, the extent
            of which itself varies according to the physical
            characteristics of the tube and the environment in which it
            is operated. According to circumstances, the frequency may
            range as low as 10 pulses per second or range as high as
            10.sup.4 pulses, these figures being exemplary only and not
            limitative. </p>
          <p align="left">Most prior art vacuum arc discharge has been
            performed with devices having short interelectrode gap
            lengths and small electrode areas. Prior art devices require
            the application of large kilovoltages and amperages, vacuum
            arc discharges in those devices being initiated by contact
            and separation of the electrodes. We have established that
            vacuum devices equipped with cathodes having large surface
            areas and having large interelectrode distances will support
            field-emission discharges (either of the pulsed abnormal
            glow or the vacuum arc type) at low DC voltages (ie. low
            field strengths) and low applied currents. This indicates
            that the cold-cathode emissions observed (pulsed abnormal
            glow discharge and the vacuum arc discharge) in this new
            class of vacuum pulse generator are a function of parameters
            heretofore ignored or undiscovered. </p>
          <p align="left">The present invention provides a pulse
            generator and a method of pulse generation as set forth in
            the appended claims. </p>

          <p align="left">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </p>
          <p align="left">The context of the invention in terms of
            vacuum discharge phenomena will first be discussed with
            reference to FIGS. 1 and 2. Referring to FIG. 1, which plots
            the potential between the principal electrodes of a vacuum
            discharge tube with increasing current, potential being
            shown on a linear but arbitrary scale of voltage, and
            current on a logarithmic scale in amperes, curve A, below
            its intersection with curve B, represents a typical
            relationship between current and voltage for cold cathode
            discharges, including auto-electronic emissions, whilst
            curve B represents a typical relationship for thermionic
            glow discharges, including thermionic emissions. The
            high-current intersection of the two curves at point E
            represents a transition into the vacuum arc discharge (VAD)
            region (curve C) with the establishment of a continuous low
            resistance plasma channel between the electrodes. </p>
          <p align="left">It will be noted that curve A exhibits, with
            increasing current from very low levels, an initially rising
            voltage or "positive resistance" characteristic, through the
            Townsend discharge (TD) region, a flat characteristic
            through the constant discharge (CD) region, a falling
            voltage or "negative resistance" characteristic through the
            transitional region discharge (TRD) and normal glow
            discharge (NGD) regions, to a minimum, before once again
            rising to a peak of F and then falling to an even lower
            minimum, equal to the sustaining voltage for a vacuum arc
            discharge, through the abnormal glow discharge (AGD) region.
            The rising potential over the first portion of the AGD
            region is believed occasioned by saturation of the
            electrodes by the glow discharge, which causes the potential
            to rise until auto-electronic emission sets in allowing the
            potential to fall again as the current rises further. In
            practice, the increasing interelectrode potential-following
            saturation, and other factors such as electrode heating,
            leading to thermionic emission, will tend in conventional
            tubes to result in a premature transition from the AGD into
            the VAD regime, following a curve similar to curve D shown
            in FIG. 1. </p>
          <p align="left">The present invention relies on the use of gas
            discharge tubes designed to avoid premature transition from
            the AGD to the VAD regimes, and capable of being operated in
            a stable manner in that region of the characteristic curve
            of FIG. 1 extending between points E and F. FIG. 2, which
            plots test results for just such a tube, constructed as
            described below, shows, again on similar coordinates to FIG.
            1 (except that the potential units are defined), the
            extinction or sustaining potentials of the tube (the same
            information as plotted in FIG. 1), together with the
            breakdown potential (i.e. the potential required to initiate
            the autoelectronic discharge). It will be noted that the
            breakdown curve shows two discontinuous portions X and Y,
            corresponding to the vacuum arc and abnormal glow discharge
            regimes respectively. The intersection of curve X, and curve
            Z representing the sustaining or extinction potential is
            illustrative of the difficulties inherent in extinguishing a
            vacuum arc discharge, since a decrease in current is
            accompanied by a decrease in breakdown voltage until it
            equals the VAD sustaining voltage which does not vary
            greatly in this region. On the other hand, the combination
            of a fairly high and constant breakdown voltage (curve Y)
            combined with an extinction potential which rises with
            decreasing current in the region E-F (see FIG. 1) of the
            pulsed abnormal glow discharge regime means that the pulsed
            abnormal glow discharge will be extinguished if the current
            source during the tube operation ceases to be able to
            sustain the increasing current required to maintain the
            discharge as the potential between its electrodes drops, at
            some current below the intersection of curves X and Z. </p>
          <p align="left">If the effective internal resistance of the
            source is above some critical level, then as the current
            through the tube rises, the proportion of the source
            potential developed across the tube will fall until it
            intersects the curve Z at a current below the intersection
            with curve X, at which point the abnormal glow discharge
            will self extinguish, and the current flow through the tube
            will drop abruptly until the current through the tube
            combined with the potential between its electrodes again
            intersects the curve A in FIG. 1. This permits
            reestablishment of a rising current through the tube
            traversing the abnormal glow discharge region as the
            potential across the tube rises to the peak F and then again
            falls to a point short of E. Accordingly, under these
            circumstances, a pulsed abnormal glow discharge will be
            exhibited, accompanied by high amplitude current pulses
            through the tube. It should be understood that the curves of
            FIG. 1 are indicative of the static behaviour of a nominal
            discharge tube under particular current and voltage
            conditions, and are not fully indicative of the behaviour of
            the tube under dynamic conditions in which tube current and
            inter-electrode potential vary with time, nor with changes
            of the many other factors which may influence tube
            behaviour. In particular, the plasma effects generated in
            various phases of tube operation require finite time to
            form, reform or dissipate as the case may be, and in the
            case presently under consideration this time factor,
            combined with time constants of the external circuit in
            which the tube is placed, are determinative of the pulse
            frequency of the discharge. </p>
          <p align="left">The definition of any regime of electrical
            discharge in a vacuum is usually presented as dependent upon
            the major operational parameter being considered, i.e. upon
            the variation of direct current passing between the primary
            electrodes. For a given optimal vacuum (which must
            necessarily be less than perfect) all gas electrical
            discharge regimes can be presented as dependent upon this
            parameter. FIG. 1 is such a presentation and the peak that
            characterizes the abnormal discharge region means that
            within this region, as the applied current is increased
            linearly, the resistance of the vacuous medium in the tube
            first increases with increasing current, only to
            subsequently decrease, still with increasing applied
            current, down to the minimum resistance value corresponding
            to the sustaining potential of a "vacuum" arc (which is
            somewhat above the ionization potential of the gas, or in
            fact of the metal vapour, in the enclosure). As the
            transition from a normal glow discharge into a "vacuum" arc
            discharge is made either directly (in thermionic devices) or
            indirectly, in cold-cathode conditions, via an abnormal glow
            discharge that may be more or less precipitous, it is only
            in the ideal diode and the ideal vacuum that both linear
            functions (corresponding to the regimes that have a
            sustaining potential) and nonlinear functions (corresponding
            to the transition regions, such as the TRD and the AGD)
            appear to depend exclusively upon the input current. In
            fact, many factors affect the AGD, foremost amongst them,
            pressure, plate distance and plate area. Hence the peak in
            the curve of FIG. 1 is an idealized view of events. </p>
          <p align="left">Experimental observations show that
            auto-electronic emissions characteristic of the pulsed
            abnormal gas discharge (PAGD) regime emerge from the NGD, as
            the current is increased beyond the point when the cathode
            glow has reached plate saturation (if the current is not too
            low and the plate area not too large). </p>
          <p align="left">The same effect occurs when the pressure is
            reduced and the current is kept constant at a suitable level
            (neither too high nor too low, exact figures depending on
            other factors such as gap distance and plate area, etc.). </p>
          <p align="left">If the current is increased further, in either
            case, the PAGD regime fully emerges (in other words, in
            pumpdown tests, the applied current also has to be
            sufficient). In this regime the plate is not so much
            saturated with a negative glow (which remains, but is
            attenuated), as it exhibits local concentrations of the
            plasma that arise in a given area of the cathode as a
            function of the auto-electronic emission mechanism. If the
            applied current is increased in steps, a stage is reached at
            which the extinction potential of the PAGD falls until it
            meets the minimum potential of an arc discharge, as
            demonstrated in FIG. 2. With reference to FIG. 1, this means
            that the current-dependent variation of the PAGD in these
            devices passes from a high to a low extinction potential or
            from a high to a low electrical resistivity of the medium,
            and is thus localized on the descending slope of the peak in
            FIG. 1. Expressed in terms of resistance characteristics,
            the regime of the pulsed abnormal glow discharge spans, as a
            function of applied current, a subregion in which a positive
            resistance characteristic changes into a leading negative
            resistance characteristic. The pulsed regime of the AGD is
            only sustainable when the intensity of the applied current
            is greater than that needed to rapidly saturate the plates
            (but not so great as to set up a VAD), the result being
            development of auto-electronic emission with its associated
            inverted cone-like discharge and a residual, faint glow of
            the entire cathode (rather than a saturated glow discharge).
          </p>
          <p align="left">Each PAGD cycle begins as a singular emission
            and performs a cycle of functions whose electrical
            characteristics vary accordingly with time. During a
            charging process (which eventually leads to emission), the
            plate potential rises to a maximum at F (see FIG. 1), while
            being limited by the maximum virtual value of the applied
            current. Any substantial increase in the applied current is
            blocked by the insulating properties of the intervening
            medium (as if a very large resistance characterized the
            device); in the discharge process, beginning with the
            initiation of auto-electronic emission at F, conditions for
            conduction across the (operational) vacuum are established
            and, as a consequence, the resistance characteristic of the
            device becomes increasingly negative until the extinction
            potential is reached, at which point the glow discharge
            ceases. This endogenous on/off behaviour is exactly what
            characterizes the PAGD cycle. </p>
          <p align="left">Two boundary conditions arise. In the first
            case, the available current is not quite enough to sustain
            the PAGD. In this instance, full escape from the NGD regime
            and the characteristics associated with its sustaining
            potential will not occur, while any heating of the cathode
            will eventually lead to the establishment of a
            semi-thermionic cathode glow. In the second instance, there
            is a risk of degeneration into a thermionic NGD or a VAD if
            the available current is too high or sustained too long.
            This degeneration will set in during the second phase of the
            PAGD unit cycle, and may lower the resistance of the device
            to the point of constant conduction of current across the
            vacuum; the result is that the auto-electronic emission is
            not quenched, as spontaneously happens in the PAGD.
            Thereafter, extinction of the resulting VAD, which may be
            promoted by a variety of factors is an unpredictable event;
            if the current is available, the arc will burn for as long
            as there is energy supplied and as long as there is cathode
            material available to consume. A VAD in no way resembles a
            regular, cyclic oscillator, which is the outstanding aspect
            of the PAGD. Whilst an arc discharge is, like the PAGD, an
            auto-electronic emission phenomenon characterized by
            intermittences (the apparent constancy of an arc is the
            result of the very high frequency of these intermittences),
            such an arc does not exhibit the regular or quasi-regular
            cyclical nature of the PAGD, nor its inherent current
            limiting characteristics. </p>
          <p align="left">In order that a stable pulsed abnormal glow
            discharge (PAGD) as discussed above may be obtained, the
            discharge to be utilized must be capable of repeated
            excursions into the region E to F of FIG. 1. This entails
            that the tube be constructed so that, as the tube operates
            and the current through it rises, the potential across the
            tube can reach the peak F in FIG. 1 and beyond, without the
            pulsed abnormal glow discharge degenerating into a vacuum
            arc discharge. This will be influenced, among other factors,
            by the extent of thermionic emission from the cathode which
            will itself be influenced by resistive heating of the
            electrodes and their work function, as well as by their
            separation and configuration, and the nature and pressure of
            gas within the tube, as well as the presence of auxiliary
            electrodes or probes. The influence of these various factors
            is extensively exemplified below. Whilst the present
            invention is exemplified with reference to its
            implementation using certain exemplary tubes, it should be
            understood that the invention may be implemented utilizing
            any tube capable of sustaining a stable PAGD discharge
            without rapid self destruction whether or not of a structure
            specifically disclosed. Thus we have been able to sustain
            PAGD utilising tubes of diverse configuration; for example
            high voltage thermionic diodes with the anode connected as
            cathode, the cathode as anode, and the heater unused. Even
            fluorescent lighting tubes can be operated briefly in the
            PAGD regime although they are unsuitable for practical use
            and fail very rapidly since their electrodes cannot
            withstand the current densities involved. Even tubes having
            electrode structures that can withstand the currents invoved
            will not be suitable if they become heated to a point at
            which thermionic emission promotes dgeneration of a PAGD
            into a VAD. </p>
          <p align="left">FIGS. 3 through 5 of the drawings illustrate
            the construction geometry of presently preferred embodiments
            of tubes for use in pulse generators in accordance with the
            invention. The discharge tubes are assembled using accepted
            techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art
            of vacuum tube technology. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 3 shows a discharge tube, generally
            referred to by reference 50, having a cylindrical housing 52
            which is preferably a glass material. Depending on the
            interelectrode spacing of the discharge tube, which in
            accordance with the invention may range from about 2 cm to
            about 20 cm or more, the glass housing 52 is preferably
            Pyrex (trademark), or #7740 borosilicate (Corning, N.Y.).
            Such cylindrical housings 52 are commonly available in
            diameters of about 6 to about 11 cm and a variable thickness
            of about 0.2 to about 0.3 cm. Other borosilicate glass,
            quartz glass or ceramic housings can be employed as suitable
            alternatives to Pyrex glass and in sizes outside these
            commonly available ranges. </p>
          <p align="left">The discharge tube 50 further includes two
            parallel, spaced-apart electrodes comprising a cathode 54
            and an anode 56, hereinafter often collectively referred to
            as "plates" for brevity and convenience. As noted above, the
            anode and cathode in discharge tubes according to the
            invention are spaced 2 to 20 cm or more apart. The cathode
            54 and the anode 56 may be either flat or curved and are
            preferably made of 0.5 to 2.0 mm thick aluminum, nickel or
            nickel alloy, zinc or iron. The thickness of the cathode 54
            and the anode 56 is not critical and any thickness within a
            reasonable range apparent to those skilled in the art may be
            used. The surface areas of the cathode 54 and the anode 56
            are preferably quite large in comparison to the surface area
            of an anode/cathode in prior art vacuum tube devices.
            Surface areas which range from 16 to 256 cm.sup.2 have been
            tested, as described in the examples hereinafter. Although
            the scope of the invention is not believed to be limited by
            this range of surface area of values, it was generally
            observed that the larger the surface area of the
            anode/cathode tested, the more readily the discharge tube 50
            elicited PAGD discharges providing other conditions such as
            plate material, vacuum, residual gas fill, voltage and
            current remained constant. </p>
          <p align="left">A preferred material for the cathode 54 and
            the anode 56 is aluminum. Two specific types of aluminum are
            preferred: namely, H34 rolled aluminum available from the
            Alcan Company and Alzak (trademark) aluminum available from
            the Alcoa company. Other types of aluminum are assumed to
            constitute suitable material for cathode 54 and anode 56.
            Aluminum is a preferred material because of its low work
            function for field emission as well as for its other
            qualities such as relative freedom from sputtering, except
            when subjected to vacuum arc discharges, and its electrical
            conductivity. In all instances, the aluminum used for
            cathode 54 and anode 56 were degreased and rinsed in
            accordance with published methods familiar to those skilled
            in the art. </p>
          <p align="left">Each of the cathode 54 and anode 56 are
            suspended within housing 52 by a support member 58 which
            passes through hermetic seal 60 on opposite sides of the
            housing 52. The support members 58 are preferably rigid rods
            of substantially pure tungsten in a diameter of 1/16th to
            3/32nds of an inch, or any suitable diameter. The material
            of choice is round finished PureTung (trademark) available
            from Union Carbide. </p>
          <p align="left">The discharge tube 50 also includes at least
            one axial probe 62 and the discharge tube 50 shown in FIG. 3
            has a tetrode geometry with two spaced-apart axial probes
            62. Substantially pure tungsten rod is also the preferred
            material for constructing the axial probe(s). All tungsten
            rods used in assembling discharge tubes in accordance with
            the invention were repeatedly cleaned with sodium nitrate
            and fused with a beaded sleeve of uranium glass #3320
            available from the Corning Company or Nonex (trademark)
            glass #7720. These glasses are graded seals designed for
            high vacuum tungsten/Pyrex junctions. Before the metal
            components of the discharge tube 50 are introduced into the
            glass housing 52, the housing is annealed at a temperature
            of 565.degree. C. After the discharge tube was assembled, it
            was connected by a glass constriction tube to the glass
            manifold of a vacuum system (not illustrated). </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 4 illustrates a further geometry for a
            discharge tube 50 in accordance with the invention. The
            discharge tube includes a parallelepiped shaped housing 64
            which is assembled using a suitable plastic polymer sheet.
            Polymer housings are preferably made from polycarbonate
            resin, preferably ultraviolet resistant. The joints of the
            rectangular panels are sealed for example with a low vapor
            pressure resin Torr Seal (trademark) available from the
            Varian Corporation which is applied along the mating edges
            to glue the panels, or another adhesive system suitable for
            withstanding the implosive forces of very high vacuum. For
            very large housings 64 the walls are also preferably screwed
            together at spaced-apart intervals. Non-metallic internal
            braces can also be used to reinforce very large housings 64.
            The polycarbonate housings are cleaned as per manufacturer's
            instructions and all metal to polymer support interfaces,
            such as the hermetic seals 60 where electrodes 58 and
            probe(s) 62 pass through a side wall of the parallelepiped
            shaped housing 64, are preferably epoxy resin joints made
            with Torr Seal resin. The single axial probe 62 is made of
            substantially pure tungsten rod. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 5 shows transverse cross-sections of
            exemplary constructions of discharge tubes in accordance
            with the invention. FIG. 5A illustrates a cylindrical
            housing 52 with a flat plate anode 56 and cathode 54. As
            shown in FIG. 5B, the anode 56 and the cathode 54 may be
            elongated, transversely curved sections which are
            substantially semi-cylindrical in shape. This anode/cathode
            geometry is actually preferred for cylindrical housings. The
            curved electrodes may be made from laser quality reflective
            aluminum foil about 200 microns in thickness. Such
            electrodes have a current tolerance of approximately 100 mA
            of direct current in the PAGD regime and are easily
            destroyed by current induced disruptive slippage into arc
            discharge. Curved electrodes of press-formed aluminum plate
            are therefore preferred over curved electrodes made from
            aluminum foil. </p>
          <p align="left">Processing of the Vacua </p>
          <p align="left">An oil diffusion/rotary pump combination
            (EO2/E2M2, Edwards High-vacuum, using Silicone 705 diffusion
            oil), equipped with thermocouple and Penning gauges (for
            rotary and diffusion vacua, respectively), was used to
            pumpdown a large bore glass-metal vacuum system equipped
            with a baffle valve, desiccating and cold traps, down to
            10.sup..about.7 Torr (=mm Hg) pressures. At 10.sup.-3 to
            10.sup.-4 Torr, the rotary pump was bypassed, and 500 mm Hg
            of UHP (ultra high purity, spectroscopic grade 99.9996%
            pure) argon was admitted into the system. The system was
            then evacuated back to 10.sup.-4 Torr and the operation was
            repeated three more times except the third time a tension of
            25 kV (10 mA) DC was applied to the plate electrodes when
            the pressure reached .sup.- 10 mm Hg. Cold cathode normal
            glow discharge (NGD) currents of 10 mA were used to liberate
            all adsorbed gases remaining in the electrodes and the inner
            face of the housing (52,64), while the pressure fell to
            10.sup.-4 Torr. Flame heating of the housing 52 was also
            performed throughout and most intensely at the constriction
            joint. Two external, water-cooled copper RF coils were then
            applied at each end of the housing 52 and operated at 450
            KHz, at calibrated temperatures of 400.degree. C. to further
            facilitate the liberation of occluded gases, excessive
            heating being strictly avoided. Alternatively to the RF
            induction heater, an electrical tape (eg. Briskheat
            (trademark)) controlled at a temperature of 400.degree. C.
            can be applied to the glass housing. After about 30 minutes,
            the RF induction heater was turned off and a 100 Kc 30 kV
            Tesla coil was applied unipolarly to the probe(s). Then,
            once more, 500 mm Hg of UHP argon were admitted into the
            system and the cycle of evacuation, heating and bombardment
            was repeated, except this time the diffusion pump was
            connected to the system and the electron bombardment was
            carried out to pressures of 5*10.sup.-5 Torr. At this point,
            and with the 25 kV DC still on, weak x-ray production
            occurred at the plate edges and this could be detected with
            a sensitive, mica-window Geiger-Muller tube counter set at a
            5 cm distance from the discharge tube housing 52, 64. This
            x-ray production can be sustained indefinitely at these
            kilovoltages and at a pressure of 10.sup.-6 Torr, without
            degenerating into a glow discharge (ie. without evolution of
            gas and a rise in pressure). The tube was then considered to
            be practically clean (`hard` or x-ray vacuum). It was then
            pumped down to the 10.sup.-7 Torr range until all discharge
            ceased and maintained at that vacuum for a further 8 hrs.
            Seal-off at the constriction joint involved slowly heating
            the joint such that the pressure never rose above 10.sup.-6
            Torr. The end-processed discharge tubes 50 were all closed
            at different values of `hard` vacua (10.sup.-6 Torr or
            higher vacua). For discharge tubes 50 closed at lower vacua
            (medium vacuum), ie. at pressures higher than 10.sup.-6 Torr
            but lower than 10.sup.-4 Torr, the desired pressure was
            achieved by reintroducing controlled amounts of UHP argon
            and adjusting with the diffusion pump on, after thorough
            processing, as described above. For discharge tubes 50
            closed at low vacuum to medium vacuum (5 to 10.sup.-4 Torr),
            the diffusion pump did not need to be turned on and the
            procedures of heating and electron bombardment were followed
            at the maximal rotary pump vacuum of .sup.- 7.5 to
            5*10.sup.-4 Torr. The desired final pressure was achieved by
            an identically controlled re-admission of small quantities
            of UHP argon. </p>
          <p align="left">Discharge tubes 50 built with polymer-type
            housings 64 cannot withstand the heating step during
            pumpdown (nor do they require annealing). Accordingly, only
            the electron bombardment procedure was performed while
            processing the vacuum for those discharge tubes, and for
            suitably longer periods (up to 1 hour each cycle). Pumpdown
            times were also extended under those conditions. </p>
          <p align="left">During and after vacuum processing, the vacua
            were constantly tested at the electrodes and at the probes
            with a unipolar 30 kV Tesla coil, when all other electrical
            apparatus were off. At pressures near 10.sup.-4 Torr only a
            faint local bluish fluorescence could be detected, and at
            pressures greater than 5*10.sup.-5 Torr no discharge could
            be observed (so-called `black` vacuum). </p>
          <p align="left">The following examples of tests conducted with
            pulse generators incorporating discharge tubes 50 illustrate
            the character and performance of such pulse generators. The
            disharge tubes utilised are listed in Table 1. </p>
          <p align="left">For test purposes, the tubes were utilised in
            test circuits as shown in FIGS. 20A and 20B. The circuit of
            FIG. 20A was used for most tests, the additional features of

          <p align="left">In FIG. 20A, a low impedance DC power supply
            PS had terminals connected to plate electrodes of a
            discharge tube 50, in the case of a first terminal through a
            ballast resistor R, of a resistance which is selected
            according to the test being performed, and an ammeter
            capable of measuring DC current or RMS AC current. The other
            terminal was grounded. A DC voltmeter was connected across
            the tube 50, and a probe electrode of the tube 50 was left
            unconnected. <br>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________ <br>
            &nbsp; <br>
            &nbsp; </p>
          <p align="left">In FIG. 20B, the first terminal was grounded
            so that a current waveform developed across the ballast
            resistor R could be monitored by an oscilloscope OSC1,
            voltage variations across the tube being monitored by the
            oscilloscope OSC1 through a capacitor C1. The potential at
            the probe electrode was monitored through a further
            capacitor C2 by a further oscilloscope OSC2. </p>
          <p align="left">It should be understood that the above
            circuits are designed for the purpose of testing the
            invention, and in many practical applications of the pulse
            generator of the invention, it will be necessary to couple
            the plate electrodes to a further circuit arm driven by the
            pulse generator, the coupling typically utilising capacitors
            and/or diodes. The real and imaginary components of any load
            applied through such a coupling will influence the operating
            conditions of the pulse generator, and it may also be
            necessary to include diodes in series with the connections
            to the power supply as shown in FIGS. 21A &amp; B in order
            to help isolate the load from the supply, thus turning the
            pulse generator into a double ported device. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 1 </p>
          <p align="left">Volt-ampere Characteristics of a Pulse
            Generator </p>
          <p align="left">The tests described in this example were
            conducted with a discharge tube 50 (device #1) constructed
            with H34 aluminum flat plates (128 cm.sup.2 area) set 5 cm
            apart, and equidistantly from a continuous axial probe 62 in
            a vacuum which measured 10.sup.-6 Torr at time of seal off.
            FIG. 2 shows that under conditions of a positive, constant
            DC voltage applied to the anode 56 of this device, the
            volt-ampere curve for both breakdown potential (Vb, shown as
            open squares) and for the minimum discharge potentials (Vs,
            or VAD sustaining potential and Vx, or extinction PAGD
            potential, both shown as closed circles) disclose two
            regions or regimes in the operation of this device, a region
            of pulsed AGD which spanned from about 10 mA to about 150 mA
            RMS (with an applied maximum of 15 mA DC average), and a
            region of VAD at RMS current values greater than 250 mA.
            PAGD current data was derived from peak pulse RMS values and
            VAD RMS current data was obtained at steady-state. Within
            the range of the pulsed AGD, the Vb values were high and
            plateaued at about 850 volts; Vb values for the VAD regime
            were generally lower than those of the PAGD and could be
            raised by an increase in available current. </p>
          <p align="left">As shown in FIG. 6, a PAGD regime could also
            be equally identified when the supplied DC voltage was
            negative and applied to the same cathode plate 54 (see FIG.
            3), for both PAGD and VAD, Vb and Vx values (closed and open
            squares, respectively) at comparable transduced pulse RMS
            currents. Utilizing a 10-fold higher direct current power
            supply, also earth-grounded at the centertap but having a
            parallel supply capacitance of 55 mfd and a slow voltage
            recovery rate (ie. less than 200 V/sec), the same discharge
            tube 50 (device #1) yielded 10.times. higher peak PAGD RMS
            currents (2 A vs. 200 mA) than were obtained under the same
            conditions and with the same power supply by a positive
            applied voltage of equal magnitude. These findings suggest
            that, at high applied direct currents, there is a strong
            asymmetric response of the discharge tubes 50 (larger PAGD
            RMS current values with cathodic tension than with
            comparable anodic tension) with respect to the sign of the
            plate polarization in reference to earth-ground. </p>
          <p align="left">It is also apparent that the field emission
            responsible for the PAGD regime does not obey the
            Fowler-Nordheim VAD region law (see FIG. 7): whereas the VAD
            graph has the expected negative slope, the slope of the PAGD
            graph is positive, contrary to predictions by the
            Fowler-Nordheim VAD region law. This constitutes strong
            evidence for the existence of auto-electronic emission
            discharges that occur at much lower input currents than
            predicted by the Fowler-Nordheim field-emission theory. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 2 </p>
          <p align="left">Pulse Count Rates in the PAGD Region </p>
          <p align="left">Two pulse count studies were done: a first at
            low applied direct currents (&lt;1.5 mA) and a second at mid
            to high applied direct currents (1.5 mA to 200 mA). Peak
            pulse RMS currents during the second study were as high as 2
            A. Two tubes were used, each having 128 cm.sup.2 rigid, flat
            plate anode/cathode set 5 cm apart, a continual axial probe
            and a 10.sup.-6 Torr vacua at time of manufacture, but
            having different plate materials; namely H34 aluminum
            (device #1) and Alzak (trademark) aluminum (device #2)
            respectively; the applied direct currents were increased
            with the voltage from 0.1 to 1.0 mA, and all measurements
            were taken with a 1 Mohm ballast resistor. </p>
          <p align="left">At low currents (see FIG. 8), using the
            discharge tube 50 (device #1) assembled with H34 aluminum
            plates and ballasted with a 1 Mohm resistor and a lower
            pulse amplitude detection cut-off at less than 25 V, the
            pulse per minute counts at the axial probe were observed to
            increase as the anode-supplied voltage (and the current, not
            illustrated), was incremented from 300 V to 500 V. At higher
            voltages, the pulse count plateaued at a somewhat depressed
            level (FIG. 8, open squares). Conversely, utilizing a
            discharge tube (device #2) assembled with Alzak plates in an
            identical vacuum at seal off (10.sup.-6 Torr), the pulse
            counts increased with applied voltage up to a maximum
            voltage applied, the maximum pulse count being about 9 times
            higher than observed with device #1 (FIG. 8, closed
            circles). Reducing the ballast resistance increased the
            pulse rate of device #1 to a maximum of 1000 pps or 60,000
            PPM with a 0.125 ohm resistor, and increased the pulse rate
            of device #2 to 4000 pps or 240,000 PPM. Analysis of the
            pulse signals with an oscilloscope showed that, in both
            instances, the observed CPM (counts per minute) values at
            the axial probe 62 effectively corresponded (about 1:1) to
            the PPM (pulses per minute) values at the cathode 54, under
            these conditions, for both devices #1 and #2. </p>
          <p align="left">At currents higher than 1.0 mA, when the PAGD
            regime is fully active, the inverse phenomenon was observed:
            ie. the pulse rates increased with a decrease in the value
            of the extinction voltage (Vx) (see FIG. 9). FIG. 9
            illustrates the continuous variation of the pulse per minute
            rate as a function of anode-supplied (open squares) or
            cathode-supplied (open circles) DC voltage, at applied
            currents that varied from 1 to 200 mA (the higher current
            sequence for the anode voltage is on the left); the anode
            voltage curve shown on the right side of the figure was
            obtained using an intermediate current supply; the two other
            slopes were obtained using a high current supply;
            capacitance values for both high and intermediate current
            supplies were respectively, 50 and 1 mfd, both power
            supplies being earth-grounded; the discharge tube (device
            #1) had 128 cm.sup.2 H34 aluminum plates set 5 cm apart and
            enclosed a vacuum measured at 10.sup.-6 Torr at time of seal
            off. </p>
          <p align="left">Pulse rates also increased proportionally to
            the transduced pulse RMS current (see FIG. 10). FIG. 10
            illustrates an increase in the pulse frequency per minute as
            a function of the peak pulse RMS current, at applied
            currents from 1 to 200 mA; corresponding voltages are shown
            in FIG. 9 (not for all points) and the higher current,
            anode-supplied curve corresponds to the lower voltage curve
            in FIG. 9, all conditions being as described for FIG. 9. The
            pulse rate increase was observed for both positive and
            negative polarizations (squares and circles, respectively,
            in both FIGS. 9 and 10) of the `vacuum`, with discharge tube
            50 (device #1). Under these conditions and with a 1 Mohm
            ballast resistor, rates of 113-124 pps were measured, the
            limiting factor being the recovery time of the voltage
            regulation of the power supply as the current drain
            increased. This phenomenon was exaggerated when no ballast
            was employed and the largest peak pulse currents were
            observed (not shown). With faster recovery power supplies
            capable of delivering the same or higher input currents (and
            the same large value of capacitance in parallel with the
            plates) much higher pulse rates (&gt;1,000 pps) could be
            obtained, along with larger peak pulse RMS currents. </p>

            Generator as a Function of Decreasing Pressure </p>
          <p align="left">Argon pumpdown tests were conducted to
            determine whether and when the PAGD region of the discharge
            was apparent utilizing comparably low voltages (up to 2.5
            kV). These tests were performed with both the diffusion pump
            off and on. FIG. 11 shows a typical curve of the variation
            of the sustaining/extinction voltages at the plates with
            decreasing pressure at the rotary pump, from breakdown (at
            860 VDC) to glow extinction, for all four discharge tubes 50
            examined (device #'s 3 to 6), which were assembled with H34
            aluminum plates having different electrode areas: device #3,
            16 cm.sup.2 (small closed squares); device #4, 64 cm.sup.2
            (open circles); device #5, 128 cm.sup.2 (open squares);
            device #6, 128 cm.sup.2 (large closed squares). Each
            discharge tube 50 had the same gap distance of 5.5 cm and
            was assembled with the same volume of glass envelope.
            Devices #3 to 5 were evacuated simultaneously and an
            identical average direct current of 1 mA was applied to each
            separately, using comparable power supplies ballasted with a
            1 Mohm resistor. Device #6 was evacuated in a separate test,
            under the same pumpdown conditions and at the same applied
            potential of 860 VDC at breakdown, but was subjected to a
            100-fold higher, average direct current of 500 mA. It is
            readily apparent that the continuously varying,
            sustaining/extinction voltage curves shown in FIG. 11 are
            analogous to the Paschen gas breakdown voltage curve and
            that throughout most of the voltage range all three low
            current curves are parallel. Independent determinations of
            the low current breakdown voltage curves for all three
            discharge tubes 50 (devices #3 to 5) showed the exact same
            relation for all three curves as observed for the
            sustaining/extinction voltage curves (results not shown).
            The differences between the electrical discharge regimes
            observed as a function of decreasing pressure are most
            apparent in the larger plate area discharge tube 50 (device
            #5). The three regions of the discharge, the transitional
            glow, the normal glow and the pulsed abnormal glow, are
            clearly distinguishable for that device (see FIG. 11). FIG.
            11 illustrates a continuous variation of NGD sustaining/PAGD
            extinction voltages (Vs/Vx), from breakdown to glow
            extinction, with decreasing pressure (at a rotary pump), in
            4 discharge tubes having different plate areas but the same
            electrode material (H34 aluminum), the same gap distance and
            the same potential of 860 VDC prior to breakdown; all curves
            except that joining the large closed squares, were measured
            using the same low applied direct current of 1 mA; the curve
            joining the large closed squares was obtained with an
            average direct current of 500 mA; the three quasi-parallel,
            low current curves for discharge tubes (devices #3 to #5)
            having anode/cathode areas of 16 (small closed squares), 64
            (open circles) and 128 cm.sup.2 (open squares),
            respectively, were obtained during a simultaneous test; the
            high-current curve for a 128 cm.sup.2 plate discharge tube
            (device #6) was measured during a separate test. In all
            cases, pumpdown was performed in an argon atmosphere. The
            scale markings for different glow discharge regions shown at
            the upper part of the diagram refers only to observations
            made with a 128 cm.sup.2 area discharge tube device #5 at
            low applied currents. In the transitional region discharge
            (TRD), the cathode glow is of minimal point-like size and
            rapid oscillations of the striations of the plasma positive
            column originate quasi-sinusoidal, dampened sinusoids,
            ramp-like or noise-like waveforms associated with sporadic,
            small amplitude (2 to 15 volts), pulsed auto-electronic
            emissions. In this region the voltage tends to fall, while
            oscillating erratically at first. As the pressure further
            decreases, there follows a stable normal glow discharge
            (NGD) region, where conduction of direct current across the
            vacuum pre-empts the possibility of auto-electronic
            emission. The lowest voltages are observed in this region.
            After the recession of the positive column and upon glow
            saturation of the plate areas, just as the cathode glow is
            beginning to recede, the intense, large amplitude (&gt;100
            V), pulsed auto-electronic emission characteristic of the
            PAGD regime emerges. In this region, the voltage tends to
            climb until extinction occurs before the maximum voltage of
            860 V is again attained. In the other two devices at the
            same low applied direct current, the borders of the
            discharge regimes are blurred. In device #3, the low
            intensity, small amplitude auto-electronic emissions develop
            into a few high intensity, large amplitude emissions, as
            they decrease in frequency and with considerable overlap;
            the PAGD and NGD regimes are also mostly mixed, until lower
            pressures of the order of 0.01 Torr are attained, at which
            point the PAGD regime functions alone at low frequency. In
            device #4, the NGD regime can be better distinguished from
            the TRD, and the PAGD from the NGD, but high intensity,
            large amplitude auto-electronic emissions occur early on in
            the NGD region as the glow saturates the plates faster than
            for device #5. There is a dual effect on increasing the
            average applied direct current 100-fold (device #6, large
            closed squares, shown in FIG. 11): the entire ascending arm
            of the voltage curve is displaced upward in the pressure
            scale and the modal distribution of the voltage variation is
            compressed. The high applied direct current also abrogates
            the two discharge regions that preceded the PAGD. From
            breakdown to extinction, the regime of the discharge is
            solely that of the PAGD, the positive column of the
            discharge weakening with the decreasing pressure. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 12 illustrates a continuous variation of
            PAGD frequency with decreasing gas pressure in 3 discharge
            tubes having different anode and cathode plate areas (16,
            64, 128 cm.sup.2) but the same cathode material (H34
            aluminum) and the same gap distance of 5.5 cm; all 3
            discharge tubes (device #'s 3 to 5) were applied the same
            potential of 860 VDC prior to breakdown and were stimulated
            with the same direct current of 1 mA; pumpdown was performed
            with a rotary vacuum pump in an argon atmosphere; neither
            the quasi-sinusoidal nor the noise-like oscillations
            observed upon breakdown and during the transitional
            discharge region, nor the low intensity auto-electronic
            pulsed emission (2 to 15 v maximum amplitude) observed in
            the same region, are shown. In all three devices, the PAGD
            regime first appeared mixed together with the NGD regime in
            the form of pulses that perturbed the steady-state glow, the
            pulses increasing in frequency with the decreasing pressure
            until a maximum pulse rate was attained. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 13 illustrates a shift of the PAGD regime
            to higher pressure regions during pumpdown with a rotary
            vacuum pump in an argon atmosphere, as a function of a
            500-fold increase in applied direct current (1 vs. 500 mA),
            at the same starting voltage of 860 VDC and utilizing the
            same 128 cm.sup.2 H34 aluminum plate discharge tube (device
            #5) in two separate tests. The higher current displaces the
            PAGD region upward in the pressure scale, just as was
            observed in the ascending arm of the voltage curve (see FIG.
            11). The displacement induced by the applied high current
            occurs over a pressure range where, at low current (1 mA)
            and with the same applied potential at breakdown, some weak,
            low-amplitude, pulsed auto-electronic emissions are observed
            during the TRD. </p>
          <p align="left">FIG. 14 illustrates a shift of the PAGD regime
            to lower pressure regions and higher frequencies during
            pumpdown with a rotary vacuum pump in an argon atmosphere,
            as a function of a higher applied potential; starting
            voltages were 860 (closed squares) and 1500 VDC (open
            squares). The discharge tube (device #3) had plate areas of
            16 cm.sup.2 and the results shown are from separate tests
            with the same power supply, at low currents (average 1 mA).
            FIG. 14 shows the effect of increasing the starting DC
            voltage at breakdown by 1.75-fold (from 860 to 1507 VDC).
            The increased current displaced the PAGD upper pressure
            limit downward in the pressure scale, in opposition to the
            current effect and it also increased by a factor of about
            8.8 the frequency of the intense, large amplitude,
            auto-electronic emissions. </p>
          <p align="left">Using the same applied low direct current and
            potential magnitude at breakdown (860 VDC) described for the
            tests represented in FIGS. 11 and 12, pumpdown of the three
            different plate area discharge tubes 50 (each having
            interelectrode distances of 5.5 cm) was performed with the
            oil diffusion pump on. While the effect of increasing the
            plate area under these conditions remained the same, ie.
            lowering the pressure for the same sustaining/extinction
            potential and displacing the PAGD region to regions of
            higher vacuum, there was a noticeable difference compared
            with the same test done with the rotary pumpdown: ie. the
            extinction pressure was greatly extended downward in the
            pressure scale for all devices, and, consequently, the PAGD
            region was greatly expanded into the medium to high vacuum
            ranges. A 128 cm.sup.2 plate area discharge tube 50 with 5.5
            cm gap, (devices #11 and 12) typically reached PAGD
            extinction at 5*10.sup.-5 Torr, though its peak pulse rate
            remained basically unchanged. This overall displacement of
            the PAGD phenomenon to higher vacuum regions under
            conditions of oil diffusion evacuation may well be due to
            the migration of very low vapor pressure oil molecules to
            the tube ends (despite the baffle and the cooling trap) and
            their interaction with residual gas molecules in the
            electrical field of the devices. With the diffusion pump on
            and voltages progressively increasing up to 2.5 kV with
            decreasing pressure, the PAGD regime in these discharge
            tubes 50 operated from 10.sup.-3 to 10.sup.-5 Torr.
            Typically a 128 cm.sup.2 H34 aluminum plate discharge tube
            50 (5.5 cm gap) will operate in the PAGD regime at
            2*10.sup.-5 Torr, with an applied voltage of 2.2 kV and at a
            pulse rate of 30 pps. With higher vacua (&lt;10.sup.-5 Torr)
            and voltages, ultimately the PAGD regime gives way to the
            production of cathode rays and very weak x-rays. From
            several such diffusion pumpdown tests it was concluded that
            the PAGD was facilitated by the use of Alzak electrode
            material and, as it will be shown in Example 4, by larger
            plate areas. </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 4 </p>
          <p align="left">The Effect of the Plate Area on the PAGD
            Characteristics During Pumpdown </p>
          <p align="left">The effect of increasing the plate area of the
            cathode 54 and anode 56 of a discharge tube 50 was tested by
            two methods: 1) using a pumpdown method of varying the
            vacuum by equilibrating of the gas flow against a rotary
            pump (as explained below) and 2) using sealed housings 52,
            64 enclosing a vacuum of 2*10.sup.-6 Torr obtained with the
            diffusion pump (see Example 5). </p>
          <p align="left">The results from the first test is shown in
            FIGS. 11 and 12, for the discharge tubes 50 stimulated with
            low (1 mA) direct currents, at the same starting potential
            of 860 VDC at breakdown. A comparison indicates that the
            effect of increasing the plate area in discharge tubes 50
            having the same gap distance, and thus the same pd value
            (pressure, in Torr, multiplied by interelectrode gap
            distance, in cm), and the same volume, is to depress the
            voltage, particularly in the NGD and PAGD regions and to
            displace the auto-electronic pulsed emission characteristic
            of the PAGD regime to a higher vacuum range. The peak
            frequency of PAGD for each given area is also attained, in
            each case, at a vacuum that increases proportionately to the
            order of increasing area (16.fwdarw.64.fwdarw.128 cm.sup.2)
            as does the magnitude of the peak frequency of PAGD for a
            given gap distance. The distribution of PAGD frequencies
            also narrows its characteristic mode with the larger area
            plates, by displacing an upper pressure limit to lower
            pressure regions, the most significant shift in this respect
            being from the 64 to the 128 cm.sup.2 devices (FIG. 12, open
            circles vs. open squares). This combined compression of the
            distribution mode and its shift to the left in the pressure
            scale corresponds to a better definition between the NGD and
            the PAGD regimes afforded by the discharge tube 50 with the
            largest plate area employed (128 cm.sup.2), as discussed
            above in Example 3. Moreover, in accordance with Paschen's
            law, the observed area-dependent voltage reduction effect
            cannot be explained, inasmuch as the voltage is predicted to
            remain the same as long as the product pd is constant, even
            if the plate area increases. Since the interelectrode gap
            distance was constant for all devices and as the pumpdown
            was also performed simultaneously and the tubes had
            identical volumes, it is apparent that there is an electrode
            plate area effect which is not accounted for by Paschen's
            law. The observed plate area effect appeared to have an
            effect opposite to current and in the same direction of
            increasing potential, as it displaced the PAGD region
            downward in the pressure scale to higher vacuum regionsand
            increased the PAGD frequency. In addition, an increase in
            area also reduces the magnitude of the potential. From the
            results shown in FIG. 14, and a comparison with FIG. 12, it
            is apparent that an increase of 1.75-fold for a given
            breakdown potential of a 16 cm.sup.2 discharge tube yields
            the same pulse rate (about 60 pps) as does an 8-fold
            increase in plate area for the same volume housing (52, 64),
            but requires a lower pressure. </p>
          <p align="left">A comparison of breakdown order and pressure,
            as well as of peak pps values and peak pps conditions
            carried out as a function of plate area for the discharge
            tubes 50 (devices #'s 3 to 5) represented in FIGS. 11 and
            12, is shown in Table 2. The discharge tube 50 with the
            largest plate area, which was the first to undergo breakdown
            (during six separate tests) at the highest pressure of 3
            Torr, yields an 8-fold higher PAGD rate than the discharge
            tube 50 with the smallest plate area of 16 cm.sup.2, at the
            lowest pressure (the pressure is 24 times lower than that of
            the 16 cm.sup.2 device). This peak pps rate occurs, however,
            at a voltage which is about 9.5% greater for the discharge
            tube 50 with the largest plate area. These results suggest
            that a larger plate area promotes breakdown at higher
            pressures (ie. the breakdown pressure decreases inversely to
            the order of increasing plate area) and supports lower
            sustaining/extinction voltages. </p>
          <p align="left">Tables 3 and 4 list sampled data from the
            tests shown in FIGS. 11 and 12. Table 3 shows a comparison,
            by fixed voltages, of values on the ascending arm of
            pressure dependent voltage curves for three discharge tubes
            50 having different plate areas. Table 4 shows the pressure
            variation predicted by the Paschen law if the devices had an
            interelectrode gap that varied proportionally to a linear
            scaling factor k.sub.L (which they do not) and a pressure
            that varied inversely to the linear scaling factor k.sub.L.
            In both Tables 3 and 4 the first six vertical columns
            describe (1) the plate area values of the three discharge
            tubes 50 tested, (2) the linear scaling factors k.sub.L for
            each discharge tube 50 based exclusively on the linear plate
            dimensions (ie. not implying a k.sub.L scaled gap distance),

          <p align="left">Table 3 is horizontally divided into two
            parts. Groups A and B represent two sets of theoretical
            predictions derived from the Paschen law and in conformity
            with the Child-Langmuir theory of the NGD. </p>
          <p align="left">Group A represents the model for a linear
            scaling of all dimensions, as when the plate factor k.sub.L
            also applies to the distance between the plates, which thus
            must increase by the k.sub.L value. This requires that for
            the voltage to remain unchanged, the pressure must decrease
            by the reciprocal of the k.sub.L value. Accordingly, a
            theoretical pressure reduction factor (prf) is shown in
            vertical column 8 of Table 3, and the predicted pressure
            values shown in vertical column 5. </p>
          <p align="left">Since in group B, the k.sub.L scaling factor
            does not apply to the gap distance, which thus remains
            constant at 5.5 cm, the theoretical prf is unity and the
            pressure remains constant if the voltage is to remain the
            same. </p>
          <p align="left">For the horizontal sample groups numbered 1 to
            6, column 5 shows the experimental pressure values obtained
            for the same sample voltage and column 8 shows the observed
            prf values. Column 7 shows the experimental pps rates. It is
            readily apparent from the experimental values of Table 3,
            that identical voltages entail reduced pressures that
            diminish as an area dependent effect. Contrary to the
            prediction (group B, Table 3), and despite the fact that the
            interelectrode gap distance remains the same for all the
            discharge tubes 50 (device #'s 3 to 5), a constant voltage
            is only attained at a lower pressure for the discharge tubes
            50 with larger plate areas. In other words, the product pd
            is not constant for a given voltage, and thus does not
            conform to the Paschen Law prediction of a prf that equals
            unity for all discharge tubes 50 regardless of their plate
            area. </p>
          <p align="left">In Table 4 only experimental data is
            presented. The predicted voltages shown in vertical column 6
            of Table 4, were obtained using as parameter the
            experimental values observed for the discharge tube 50 with
            the smallest area (16 cm.sup.2) used in these tests, at
            pressure intervals determined from arbitrary prf factors
            (vertical column 9, Table 4) chosen in accordance with a
            theoretical model of the horizontal group A from Table 3,
            that is, as if the reciprocal of the k.sub.L factor applied
            to the pressure of these discharge tubes, even though the
            interelectrode gap remained constant. Using those pressure
            intervals, and the actual voltages observed for the other
            two discharge tubes (64 cm.sup.2 and 128 cm.sup.2, vertical
            column 7, Table 4), the experimentally observed voltage
            reductions as % of the 16 cm.sup.2 voltage reference (shown
            in column 6) were determined and are shown in vertical
            column 10, Table 4. </p>
          <p align="left">The experimental data listed in Tables 3 and 4
            was then used to calculate relative, average pressure
            reduction factors using the fixed voltage series shown in
            Table 3, column 8, and percentage voltage reductions using
            the 1/k.sub.L pressure series shown in Table 4, column 10.
            Those calculations interrelated all the discharge tubes used
            for the low current pumpdown test with respect to their
            plate area factors, or k.sub.A values: ie. k.sub.A =2, when
            comparing the 64 cm.sup.2 and 128 cm.sup.2 discharge tubes;
            k.sub.A =4, when comparing the 16 cm.sup.2 and the 64
            cm.sup.2 discharge tubes; and k.sub.A =8, when comparing the
            16 cm.sup.2 and 128 cm.sup.2 discharge tubes. To triangulate
            the data, k.sub.A =8 results for the voltage series of Table
            5 were derived by comparing the pressures obtained for the
            16 cm.sup.2 and 128 cm.sup.2 discharge tubes, shown in Table
            1. With respect to the pressure series of Table 5, whereas
            the 16 cm.sup.2 device was used as a 100% voltage reference
            for the k.sub.A =4 and k.sub.A =8 results, the k.sub.A =2
            results were determined by comparing the percentage voltage
            reduction for the 64 cm.sup.2 and 128 cm.sup.2 devices. From
            the triangulated data, statistical means and their standard
            errors were calculated to determine the regression curves of
            the area dependent pressure reduction effect obtained when
            the voltage is constant (FIG. 15A), and of the
            area-dependent voltage reduction as % of the maximum, when
            the voltage of the 16 cm.sup.2 discharge tube is taken as a
            reference voltage and the pressure is varied arbitrarily in
            accordance to the reciprocal of the k.sub.L factor(FIG.
            15B). FIGS. 15A and 15B strikingly illustrate the effect of
            increasing the k.sub.A factor or the plate area in these
            discharge tubes 50. A lower pressure is required for the
            same voltage (ie. a prf lower than unity), the voltage being
            depressed when the pressure is constant. Within the k.sub.A
            range tested, both regression curves are linear. Following
            the regression curve of FIG. 15A, one can predict that a
            k.sub.A =17 will reduce the pressure by one order of
            magnitude. Conversely, following the regression curve of
            FIG. 15B, one can predict that for the same pressure and the
            same interelectrode gap distance, the voltage will be
            depressed by 50% with a k.sub.A =.sup..about. 21.5. These
            predictions, however, will only hold if the curve remains
            linear throughout a wider range of k.sub.A values. </p>
          <p align="left">In conclusion, the effect of increasing the
            plate area of discharge tubes stimulated with the same
            starting voltage and the same current is to: 1) shift the
            breakdown pressure upwards, 2) depress the working voltage,
            3) increase the pulse rate both in the TRD and PAGD regions,
            4) shift the PAGD region downwards in the pressure scale and
            segregate the discharge regimes more clearly as a function
            of decreasing pressure. These observations also explain why
            the discharge tubes with smaller plate areas shift the PAGD
            up in the pressure scale, as an increase in current does.
            Effectively, a smaller plate area not only concentrates the
            lines of electrostatic force in a vacuum, but it also
            increases the current density per unit area, with the
            consequent glow saturation of the plates, necessary for the
            abnormal glow discharge region to be attained, occurring
            earlier on during pumpdown, than for discharge tubes with
            larger plate areas. <br>

          <p align="left">The Effect of Plate Area on the PAGD
            Characteristics of Discharge Tubes Enclosing a High Vacuum </p>
          <p align="left">The second method used to test the effect of
            increasing the electrode plate area in the design of a
            discharge tube 50 made use of glass housings 52 enclosing a
            final vacuum of 2*10.sup.-6 Torr obtained with a diffusion
            pump on. These tests were performed with high direct
            currents (200 mA to 1 A). All discharge tubes tested (device
            #'s 7 to 13) had an interelectrode gap distance of 5 cm,
            enclosed the same volume and the same vacuum, and were
            assembled with H34 aluminum plates having plate areas which
            varied by an area factor of k.sub.A =2, namely: 16, 32 (not
            tested), 64, 128 and 256 cm.sup.2. At a seal off vacuum of
            2* 10.sup.-6 Torr, the first two discharge tubes 50 tested
            in this series (16 and 64 cm.sup.2, device #'s 7 to 10)
            remained unresponsive (no signs of discharge). Even when 3.3
            kV was applied, one of the 64 cm.sup.2 discharge tubes
            showed only a faint glow (also see discussion of results for
            groups #1 and #4 of Table 6 below). The results for the
            k.sub.A =2 series are shown in FIG. 16. The results indicate
            that when the current, the interelectrode distance and the
            pressure are all kept constant, the breakdown potential (Vb)
            for the PAGD decreases with an increase in plate area. For
            the largest plate area tested (256 cm.sup.2), the PAGD
            breakdown (287 V) and extinction (Vx=284 V) voltages
            practically coincide, suggesting that larger areas might
            depress both Vb and Vx still further. These results were
            recorded under identical conditions of applied direct
            current (200 mA, closed circles, FIG. 17), of peak pulse RMS
            current (open circles, FIG. 17) and of pulse frequency (20
            pps), using an earth-grounded centertap power supply with
            both positive and negative voltages applied simultaneously
            to the respective plates. Under the same conditions of
            applied total power (same starting voltage, but higher
            applied direct current because of their lower
            sustaining/extinction voltage), three discharge tubes 50
            built with Alzak plates having areas of 64, 78 and 128
            cm.sup.2 respectively were tested with the same power
            supply. As shown in FIG. 17, these discharge tubes conduct
            5-fold higher DC currents (closed squares, FIG. 17),
            transduce 3-fold higher peak pulse RMS currents (open
            squares, FIG. 17) and yield a 20 to 30-fold increase in pps
            (from 20 to 600 pps) at similar field strengths, when
            compared with the results obtained using hardened aluminum
            plates. </p>
          <p align="left">Table 6 shows the experimental and predicted
            results obtained with 4 discharge tubes 50 (device #'s 9,
            11, 13 and 17) assembled with hardened aluminum plates, as a
            function of scaling the plate area (column D) by a k.sub.A
            =2 area factor (column E), while varying the interelectrode
            distance inversely with respect to the pressure (group #'s
            1-3) or, alternatively, keeping these factors constant
            (group #'s 4-6), so that in both instances the pd product is
            constant. A plate area k.sub.A factor of 2 corresponds to a
            plate linear scaling factor k.sub.L of 2.sup.1/2 =1.41.
            Columns A to C show the scaling of the selected linear
            dimensions, while column G shows the vacuum measured when
            the respective housings 52 were sealed. The space charge
            theory of glow discharge holds that the function V, or the
            voltage difference at corresponding points, is the same in
            k.sub.L -scaled vacuum tubes, the linear dimensions
            (including the interelectrode gap distance) of a vacuum tube
            "b" being k.sub.L times the linear dimensions of a vacuum
            tube "a". Under these conditions where the gap distance also
            increases by the k.sub.L factor, the Poisson term d.sup.2 *V
            (where d.sup.2 V=r/e.sub.o ; r=density of the attracting
            matter at the point chosen (charge density) and e.sub.o
            =permittivity of free space) in the interelectrode space of
            vacuum tube "a" is k.sub.L.sup.2 times that in vacuum tube
            "b", as long as the pressure p changes by 1/k.sub.L so that,
            to a first approximation, the breakdown voltage remains the
            same. As the permittivity of free space is deemed to be a
            constant, the charge density r in vacuum tube "a" is
            k.sub.L.sup.2 times that of vacuum tube "b" (the upscaled
            device). Consequently, the cathode current density J of
            vacuum tube "a" is also expected to be k.sub.L.sup.2 times
            that of vacuum tube "b". We can thus summarize these
            predictions as: given a linear factor k.sub.L between "a"
            and "b", two vacuum tubes will have the same breakdown
            voltage if the pressure of "b" decreases by 1/k.sub.L, with
            the result that J should decrease by 1/k.sub.L.sup.2 and the
            field strength should also decrease by 1/k.sub.L, while
            J/p.sup.2 and E/p (where E=electrical field strength) both
            remain constant. Essentially, as the area factor between the
            two discharge tubes is k.sub.A =k.sub.L.sup.2, both the
            charge density r and the current density J should change by
            1/k.sub.L.sup.2 =1/k.sub.A, ie inversely to the plate area
            factor k.sub.A. The field strengths predicated from the
            Poisson term (E=-dV), are shown in column H, and their
            corresponding E/p ratios to be expected are shown in column
            J. Pulse rate (column L) was kept low and constant, for
            purposes of comparison between the groups. The experimental
            values measured at breakdown for each device are shown in
            Table 6, columns I (for the field strength E) and K (for
            E/p). These results indicate that, for k.sub.L (=1.4)-scaled
            discharge tubes shown in group #'s 1 to 3, Table 6, having a
            k.sub.A =2 and inversely varying p and d values (the product
            pd is constant but the pressure and distance terms obey the
            k.sub.L -scaling inverse relation) the variation of E is
            nonlinear (in fact, one would expect group #2 to be just as
            unreactive as group #1, Table 6, at these pressures). The
            Table 6 results for k.sub.L (=1.4)-scaled discharge tubes
            (group #'s 4-6, corresponding to device #'s 9-10, 11-12 and
            13, respectively) with a k.sub.A =2 but separate constant
            values for p and d, also show that the field strength E
            necessary for breakdown at these high applied currents does
            not remain constant and linear, as predicted, but decreases
            nonlinearly with an increased plate area, which is the only
            factor that changed in the series of group #'s 4-6 (device
            #'s 9-10, 11-12 and 13). It is significant that in this
            context, the field strength necessary to achieve the same
            pulse rate fell by 1/3rd (a factor of 2.8.times.) as the
            area increased by a factor of 2, in device #'s 11 and 12
            versus 13 (group #'s 5 and 6). This strongly indicates that,
            in discharge tubes enclosing a high vacuum obtained under
            oil diffusion conditions and stimulated with high currents,
            the plate area has a synergistic effect on PAGD production.
            The same frequencies of discrete, intense emission were
            obtained with lower field strengths for the plasma
            discharges triggered by these auto-electronic emissions.
            Consequently, in discharge tubes 50, large plate areas
            promote PAGD behavior at high vacua and at low field values
            not predicted by the space charge theory. <br>

          <p align="left">A comparison of pulse counts at the axial
            probe 62 (see FIGS. 2 and 4) in discharge tubes 50 and the
            pulse counts at the cathode 54 showed that the axial probe
            62 accurately reflects interelectrode events. This
            correspondence was confirmed using oscillographic analysis
            of the probe waveform, which showed it to be functionally
            equivalent to that measured at the cathode 54. FIG. 18 shows
            voltage and current oscillographs over time of AGD
            self-generated auto-electronic emission pulses (at 10 pps)
            in an H34 128 cm.sup.2 discharge tube 50 (device #1),
            registered as amplitude discontinuities between the anode
            56/cathode 54 in FIG. 18A, as current pulses at the cathode
            54 in FIG. 18B and as dual polarity field direction
            reversals of a split axial probe 62 in FIG. 18C. Typically,
            for a closed high vacuum discharge tube 50 with a plate area
            of 128 cm.sup.2 and an interelectrode gap of 5 cm, a
            breakdown potential of 668 volts, an average applied current
            of 500 ma, and at 200 pps, the pulse amplitude is more than
            300 volts. Under rotary pumpdown conditions and for an
            identical discharge tube, the pulse amplitude (encompassing
            both positive and negative components, the latter being the
            prominent value) increases with decreasing pressure, from 60
            volts at about 0.5 Torr (with 5 mA DC) to greater than 300
            volts at 0.008 Torr. In the closed high vacuum discharge
            tube with H34 plates having an area of 128 cm.sup.2 (device
            #1), higher resolution oscillographs taken at the axial
            probe 62, show that the negative component precedes the
            positive reversal and has a typically higher amplitude (140
            V vs. 80 to 120 V, respectively, for this situation shown in
            FIG. 18C). Clearly, upon an abnormal glow discharge pulse,
            the recovery of the field strength within these discharge
            tubes overshoots a `closed switch state` (where the current
            I approaches zero) and results in a net flow of positive
            charge past the probe, towards the cathode (which is the
            floating ground reference level for these measurements). </p>
          <p align="left">EXAMPLE 6 </p>
          <p align="left">Using the same breakdown voltage of about 668
            VDC, the effect of varying the capacitance of the power
            supply, set in parallel with the discharge tube (device #1),
            on the frequency of PAGD production was determined while
            maintaining all other variables constant (interelectrode
            gap, plate area, applied voltage and current levels). The
            linear regression in FIG. 19 shows that, under these
            conditions, the PAGD frequency is increased by lower
            capacitances. The log slope indicates that the pps rate is
            doubled as the capacitance decreases by 2/3rds. Measurements
            were also taken of the `non-dynamic` capacitances of
            discharge tubes with H34 aluminum plates having different
            plate areas. These were insignificant when compared with the
            parallel capacitances used in the power supply in tests
            illustrated in FIG. 16, and were observed to vary in
            accordance with the dielectric law, ie. doubling the plate
            doubled the capacitance. Thus for a plate area of 64 square
            cm, capacitance of 1 pF, for 128 sq. cm, 2.05 pF, and for
            256 sq. cm, 4.1 pF. </p>
          <p align="left">Further Factors Influencing PAGD Production </p>
          <p align="left">Prolonged operation of discharge tubes 50 has
            provided some geometrical guidelines for promoting PAGD
            production: </p>
          <p align="left">1) it is advantageous if the discharge does
            not wander to the back of the cathode 54 and this is
            facilitated by using a semi-cylindrical cathode in
            cylindrical housings 52 and a flat cathode (rectangular,
            square or circular) in parallelepiped-shaped housings 64
            (see FIGS. 3 &amp; 5). However, interelectrode gap tests are
            best done with flat plates which assure a homogenous
            potential. Moreover, the semicylindrical electrodes are best
            made of hardened aluminum, at least 0.5 to 1 mm thick, and
            this requires forming them to the right curvature, given
            that foil alternatives are not resistant to the deleterious
            effect of high-current PAGD transduction at very high
            frequencies and do not withstand distruptive VAD discharges.
            Nonetheless, a semi-cylindrical electrode configuration in a
            housing 52 makes the sheaths (where ionic recombination
            occurs during glow discharge) near the electrodes and the
            housing wall coincide, and this can be highly advantageous
            for sustaining PAGD production. The same applies to flat
            plates in flat surface parallelepiped housings 64. </p>
          <p align="left">2) The most effective axial probe 62 is either
            a single half-length rigid rod or a pair of axial probes 62
            separated at the center of the discharge tube 50 by a gap of
            more than 1 cm, 4-6 cm being optimum. Whereas an axial wire
            will perform satisfactorily as a probe 62, the rigid rod has
            the advantage of not yielding to a direct mechanical
            transduction of the electrodynamic force effected upon it by
            the discharge or to force created by the acquisition of a
            constant space charge. A split axial probe 62 facilitates
            the exciter function and assures PAGD operation by
            preventing a formation of a stable axial space-charge at
            high-current operation. </p>
          <p align="left">3) A cooling coil (made of rubber, polymer,
            glass or copper tubing) surrounding housing 52/64 is useful
            to counterbalance the heating of the anode 56/cathode 54
            which promotes the production of semi-thermionic VAD
            channels and even thermionic normal glow discharges. A
            coolant pipe system that weaves through the plates can also
            be used for this purpose, in which case flat plates are
            preferred. </p>
          <p align="left">4) Larger anode 56/cathode 54 surfaces are
            required as the interelectrode gap is increased. And
            inversely, larger anode 54/cathode 56 surfaces operate best
            if larger interelectrode gaps are used; however, the
            breakdown voltage also increases with larger interelectrode
            gaps. </p>
          <p align="left">5) One of the limitations of these discharge
            tubes stems from their continuous operation at high applied
            currents and from eventual slippage into the VAD regime,
            both of which promote a deposit of sputtered metal atoms on
            the inner walls of the housing 52, 64 thereby making them
            conductive. In order to minimize this problem,
            electromagnets may be wound longitudinally over the housing
            52, 64 (one at each end), to limit lateral dispersion of the
            discharge vortices. </p>
          <p align="left">It is apparent that several factors affect
            PAGD production namely: cold cathode work function, voltage,
            current, parallel capacitance, gas fill, pressure, geometry
            plate area and interelectrode gap distance. Except for
            capacitance at the high end of the scale, each of these
            factors affect the high and low limits of the PAGD, for any
            given set of conditions. Heretofore, parameters such as
            plate area in vacuum tubes have not been previously
            identified as factors which affect the breakdown field
            values and the sustaining/extinction potentials of a glow or
            an arc discharge. This suggests that the observed
            auto-electronic field emission in the PAGD regime is a
            function of physical factors which to date have been
            unrecognized. It further suggests that field emission is not
            a property exclusive to the VAD, ie. that it is also a
            property of the pulsed operation of an abnormal glow
            discharge in low to very high vacua. </p>
          <p align="left">The present discharge tubes 50 provide a
            design capable of transducing high peak pulse currents at
            very low field strength, over a wide range of frequencies
            with minimal slippage of the PAGD operation into either the
            NGD or the VAD regimes. </p>
          <p align="left">Although the examples described above utilise
            discharge tubes with symmetrical anode and cathode plates
            and floating probe electrodes, many other arrangements are
            possible. Thus the characteristics of the tubes may be
            adjusted by connecting the probe (or probes) through a
            capacitor to the anode or cathode to form an auxiliary anode
            or cathode. </p>
          <p align="left">Since only the cathode need be have an
            extended surface area, the probe of the tubes described may
            be connected as an anode, with the plate electrodes
            connected as either strapped or independent cathodes.
            Examples of such connections are shown in FIGS. 21A and 21B,
            which show how to incorporate a discharge tube operating in
            the PAGD regime in an inverter circuit so that the pulse
            output may be utilized by a remotely located alternating
            current device. The intermittency of the pulses produced by
            the arrangements described above are not conducive to
            efficient operation of conventional transformers, and a
            push-pull circuit arrangement is preferred. While such an
            arrangement could utilize two discharge tubes, an
            advantageous arrangement utilizes a single tube of the type
            described in the parent application, as shown in FIG. 21A.
            In this instance, both plates 8a and 8b of the tube act as
            cathodes and are connected to the diode 5, and the probe or
            auxiliary electrode, which is typically of tungsten, acts as
            a common anode 9 and is connected to the diode 6. The
            capacitors 10a and 10b are connected to opposite ends of a
            centre-tapped primary winding of a transformer 26, providing
            an alternating circuit output through a secondary winding.
            The centre-tap of the primary winding is connected to the
            electrode 9. The two halves of the primary winding
            inductively couple the cathode circuits in antiphase, thus
            synchronising the PAGD pulse trains involving the two
            cathodes in antiphase. </p>
          <p align="left">In a modification of the circuit, shown in
            FIG. 21B, the capacitors 10a and 10b are connected directly
            to the electrode 9, and the primary of the transformer 26 is
            connected directly between the two cathodes with its centre
            tap connected to the diode 5. Whilst this arrangement bears
            some superficial resemblance to known inverter circuits
            employing VAD devices, it should be noted that the circuit
            is completely self-commutating, and does not need moving
            external magnetic fields to provide commutation as in the
            prior art. </p>
          <p align="left">The electrodes themselves may be formed in
            various configurations. Provided that both the anode and
            cathode electrodes have sufficiently low impedance to
            sustain the current densities associated with PAGD without
            rapid deterioration or overheating, particularly of the
            cathode, and provided that the cathode presents a surface of
            extended area to the anode and is sufficiently separated
            from it that the cathodic plasma eruptions associated with
            AGD do not reach the anode to complete a VAD channel, the
            electrode separation and cathode surface area can be varied
            over a wide range. Large cathode surface areas tend to
            reduce the potential required to initiate AGD, and reduced
            electrode separations increase the risk of entering the VAD
            region. In practice the cathode area should usually be at
            least 2 sq. cm and preferably at least 16 sq. cm, and the
            electrode spacing should be at least 2 cm and preferably at
            least 3.5 cm. </p>
          <p align="left">Particularly when the probe is used as an
            anode, it may advantageously be formed as a wire grid or
            mesh parallel to one or more plate electrodes acting as a
            cathode or cathodes. Cathodes may be arranged on one or both
            sides, or surounding a rod anode, or facing a point anode. </p>
          <p align="left">Table 7 shows PAGD frequency results for
            various electrode configurations which have been tested.
            Configuration sd is a diode with plate electrodes and no
            probe, and configuration sd* adds an unconnected axial
            probe. In configuration t the probe was connected by a
            capacitor to the cathode. Configurations dd1 and dd2 use
            double diode configurations, with plate cathodes and an
            intermediate anode, a rod in the first case and a plate in
            the second case. Configuration cd used a cylindrical cathode
            and an axial rod anode. These tests indicate that an
            extended area of both the anode and cathode is desirable,
            although the area of the cathode has a greater influence. <br>

          <p align="left">The anode is preferably formed of metal of a
            relatively high work function, and the cathode of metal of a
            comparatively low work function, although in many cases the
            same material may be used for both as exemplified above. In
            discharge tubes, where it is desired to be able to reverse
            plate polarity, utilisation of the same metal for both
            electrodes will be advantageous. For axial probes or axial
            anodes, tungsten will give good results. Hollow or solid
            rods of the same metals selected for the cathodes may also
            be employed. Axial rods of tungsten or other selected metals
            may also be used as cathodes provided that they present
            sufficient surface area to th anode. </p>
          <p align="left">The best cathode materials identified to date
            are aluminum and its alloys, zinc, nickel, soft iron and
            silver. Cathodes made of copper and its alloys, and of
            steel, support PAGD but are of much poorer performance. </p>
          <p align="left">In Table 8 sampled data from experiments
            performed with different cathode metals (elemental or
            alloys) are shown. Except for the first two entries in Table
            8, which utilized a perpendicular "surface-to-point" type
            configuration (with the "point" being the lateral area of a
            tungsten rod utilized as a cathode), all the other entries
            were obtained with single diode configurations, utilizing
            parallel plates at various gap distances. Most of the column
            headings are self-explanatory, but it should be noted that
            the voltages shown are breakdown values which, when
            indicated, are also minimal breakdown voltages for the
            discharge type shown. </p>
          <p align="left">As exemplified in entries 1 and 2, for two
            different Argon pressures, tungsten cathodes can support the
            same cold-cathode type of low-field spontaneous emission
            responsible for the PAGD regime which we have identified in
            diverse aluminum cathodes. This matches the previous
            observation of such discontinuous emissions being aided by
            an axial tungsten member when discharge tubes with aluminum
            plates are connected in the triode configuration. A higher
            potential (750 VDC), however, is needed with this
            configuration and tungsten cathodes, than that required by
            the lowest area aluminum plates tested (cp entries 1 and 2
            with 3-7). </p>
          <p align="left">In entries 3 to 12, small (4 cm2) H34 aluminum
            plates are compared for different gap distances (3 vs. 9
            cm), and within each group (entries 3 to 7, and entries 8 to
            12) for varying pressure and nature of the residual gas. The
            net effect of increasing the gap distance is to increase the
            potential needed for electrical breakdown of the vacuum (cp
            VDC values for entries 4-7 with 9-12), as expected from
            Paschen's law. A trend for higher PAGD input currents, as a
            function of the higher vacua, is also apparent throughout
            this group. </p>
          <p align="left">In entries 13 to 28, wider aluminum cathodes
            (16 cm2) were compared at two different gap distances (2 and
            4 cm, respectively, for entries 13 to 20 and 21 to 28), for
            different pressures in air or argon atmospheres. At the same
            specified battery breakdown voltages utilized, the shorter
            gap produces much higher PAGD frequencies (100 PPS vs 30-52
            at 0.8 T Argon, respectively, entry 14 and entries 25 and
            28). The shorter gap also promotes the setting in of a
            vacuum arc discharge, when compared to the larger gap at the
            same voltage and potential (cp entry 16 with entry 26).
            Lastly, it is apparent that the PAGD frequency equally
            increases in the presence of argon (entries 24-26) with
            respect to air (entries 21-23), and with increasing input
            current (see entries 17 to 19) within the current range
            characteristic of the PAGD at the same pressure (1 Torr). </p>
          <p align="left">In entries 29 to 35, and 75 to 76, utilization
            of brass cathodes is examined for purposes of PAGD
            production. Within the PAGD current and voltage ranges
            determined for aluminum and other metals, brass cathodes
            perform poorly, with low or very low pulsation frequencies
            (entries 30, 31 and 76) and very erratic bursts of activity
            (entries 32, 34 and 35). Unlike the typically single
            aluminum and tungsten PAGD emission foci, brass presents
            multiple small cathode spot localizations in the same pulse.
            The pulsed emission, however, like those of aluminum,
            follows the same cyclic path of abnormal glow saturation,
            focusing of the discharge at the emission foci, and
            subsequent collapse of the saturated glow. </p>
          <p align="left">Results for bronze-aluminum alloy cathodes are
            shown in entries 36 to 41, and they indicate that this alloy
            does not perform as satisfactorily as aluminum for PAGD
            production, but it is certainly utilizable. However, like
            brass, in the presence of Argon, erratic bursts of emission
            pulses are also observed (cf entry 41), without the
            development of a VAD-type regime. </p>
          <p align="left">Iron, nickel and zinc cathodes, tested in the
            following sequences (respectively entries 42-50, 51-53, and
            54-60), proved to be amongst the best cathodes for PAGD
            production this purpose. Quasi-regular high PAGD frequencies
            are possible utilizing these metals (cp entry 49 &amp; entry
            60), which appeared to perform best with argon rather than
            air. Iron plates seem to eject the least metal and can
            sustain very regular frequencies of pulsed abnormal glow
            discharges. Zinc cathodes ejected the most metal and most
            easily slipped into a vacuum arc discharge having the aspect
            of a meandering flame surrounding the cathodes spots. With
            zinc cathodes, the VAD regime would onset in air at pressure
            and current values characteristic of the PAGD regime in
            Argon (cp entry 55 with entry 60), the window of the
            transition between the NGD and the VAD being rather narrow
            or absent. Even in Argon, this window remained relatively
            narrow in terms of its pressure range. </p>
          <p align="left">Tubes for pulse generators were also built
            with apposed cylindrical section electrodes made of silver
            nitrate directly coated onto the glass inner surface, and
            having a cross- section fundamentally identical to that of
            FIG. 4. Because of this geometry, the gap distance given is
            the average distance between the center and the extremities
            of the cylindrical electrodes. Experiments with such a
            device showed that silver in greater thickness would also
            form a suitable cathode to support PAGD production (entries
            64 and 65). The emission loci in silver form single cathode
            spots for each pulse generated, as with aluminum, tungsten,
            zinc, nickel and iron cathodes; however, these intermittent
            silver cathode emitters travel laterally to form
            quasi-continuous tracks of ejected cathode material. </p>
          <p align="left">Lastly, 64 cm2 wide copper and aluminum plates
            were compared, in entries 66-74 and 61-63, respectively. In
            the presence of air, under the same pressure, applied
            voltage and current conditions, copper cathodes do not
            support PAGD production (unless triggered by external
            proximity of high-frequency spark gaps, eg a Tesla coil, or
            a moving static charge, or a moving magnetic field), whereas
            aluminum cathodes do (cp entries 61 and 66). However, in
            argon (entries 68, 70-72) or helium (entries 73-74)
            atmospheres, copper cathodes readily supported PAGD
            production, though they required greater input currents to
            attain about half the PAGD frequency observed using aluminum
            plates. The PAGD region is also particularly narrow with the
            copper cathodes, when the voltage and current are at
            threshold levels needed for eliciting the regime (cf entries
            68 and 69). It is easy to see the slowing down of the PAGD
            frequency in these cathodes, apparently due to the rapid
            heating of their surface (also observed with brass and
            bronze alloys): the cycle of onset of an abnormal cathode
            glow, followed by a localized cathode eruption, then by a
            total or partial collapse of the abnormal glow onto the
            electrodes and its subsequent re- instatement, slows down
            progressively as the setting in of the cathode glow becomes
            more intense in luminosity and finally ceases giving way to
            the auto-electronic emission. A semi-thermionic abnormal
            glow discharge then sets in. This transition of the PAGD
            regime to a semi-thermionic AGD regime, in tubes using
            copper cathodes, is all the more prevalent as higher
            frequencies and higher currents are employed to stimulate
            the pulse generator, and it may explain the observed erratic
            behaviour of the copper-containing alloys, brass and bronze.
            Finally, the copper cathode emissions accompanying a single
            pulse were not single but multiple, and clustered in a
            neighbourhood, as was also observed in brass and
            bronze-aluminum alloys. </p>
          <p align="left">All the above PAGD cathode emitters that had
            reasonable characteristics (regular or quasi-regular
            spontaneous pulse discharges) presented a bell-like
            distribution for the discharge frequency, with the higher
            vacua beyond a given pressure having the effect of
            decreasing the frequency of the PAGD emission, while
            increasing the input and output peak currents as well as the
            cathode voltage drop of each pulse. Lastly, caesium emitters
            were also employed at these input currents to support PAGD
            production successfully. Other metals considered promising
            are bismuth, cadmium and antimony. <br>

            external circuit which cooperates with the tube must be such
            as to prevent the plasma eruptions from the cathode during
            PAGD from acquiring sufficient energy to reach the anode and
            forming a continuous VAD channel. This involves inter alia
            the physical dimensions of the tube, its gas content, the
            impedance of the supply and any associated ballast resistor,
            and the energy storage capacity of any reactive components
            in the pulse generator circuit, such that the potential
            across the tube falls below the AGD extinction potential
            before a plasma channel to the anode is established.
            Although it may be possible to acieve this with a very small
            cathode area or small interelectrode gap, the amounts of
            energy involved in creating the plasma eruptions and
            released by their collapse will likely become too small to
            be useful. </p>
          <p align="left">In conclusion, we have developed a series of
            pulse generators exploiting the abnormal glow discharge
            regime, as well as a series of low to very high vacuum
            discharge tubes which support the production of PAGDs. In
            testing these devices we have shown that: </p>
          <p align="left">the low field strengths and typical low
            emission current densities observed in the PAGD regime are
            not predicted by any existing field emission or space-charge
            theories; </p>
          <p align="left">the PAGD regime responds asymmetrically to the
            polarity of the applied voltage at high applied currents; </p>
          <p align="left">at low applied currents, the PAGD pulse rate
            increases with the applied voltage and the current up to an
            observed plateau; </p>
          <p align="left">at mid to high applied currents, the PAGD
            pulse rate increases with an increase in current and with a
            lowering of the extinction potential; </p>
          <p align="left">the PAGD pulse rate also varies with the
            composition of the cathode material (the pulse rate is
            promoted by materials having a low work function) and
            increases with a decrease in pressure, during pumpdown, to a
            maximal peak rate, thereafter either diminishing to the
            point at which the discharge extinguishes or gives way to
            x-ray production (depending on the magnitude of the applied
            potential); </p>
          <p align="left">larger area plates lower the field strength
            values needed to elicit comparable PAGD production, displace
            the PAGD region downward in the pressure scale and increase
            the peak PAGD rate; </p>
          <p align="left">higher power supply capacitances slow down the
            PAGD rate. </p>
          <p align="left">Exploitation of PAGD permits the production of
            highly efficient pulse generators for the production of
            endogenously generated abnormal glow discharge pulses
            triggered by intense, cathodic auto-electronic emissions
            under conditions of a constantly applied DC potential. </p>
          <p align="left">These pulse generators have diverse industrial
            applications; directly, they may be used as stroboscopic
            light sources, for vacuum deposition of cathode materials or
            cathode coatings (eg. polymer deposition or aluminum
            mirroring of target surfaces), detection of ionizing
            radiation fields, or electrostatic and electromagnetic
            proximity fields, high power noise-signal generation,
            destructive component testing (transient response) or
            destructive testing of materials in vacua (eg. insulations),
            high frequency medium voltage power supply applications
            (switching supplies and inverters), as an oscillator or as
            part of a pulse forming network. Indirectly, they may be
            used for laser pulsing, flash tube pulsing or for research
            (eg. chemical reaction triggering) and industrial switching
            applications. </p>

          <p align="left">Table 9 shows additional data related to that
            of Example 5 and Table 6. In Table 9, columns A through G
            are the same as in Table 6 for ease of reference. Current
            densities (Table 9, columns I and M) for the overall
            electrode areas employed were determined experimentally and
            compared to the values predicted on the basis of the glow
            discharge theory (Table 9, columns H and L), under the same
            conditions and with the same devices as described in Example
            5. As explained above in Example 5, and given a linear
            factor k.sub.L, two vacuum tubes "a" and "b", will have the
            same breakdown voltage if the pressure of "b" decreases by
            1/k.sub.L, with the result that J (the average electrode
            current density) should decrease by 1/k.sub.L 2 while
            J/p.sup.2 should remain constant (if the pressure varies).
            Predicted and experimentally determined J/p.sup.2 values are
            shown in columns J and K of Table 9. Essentially, as the
            area factor between the two pulse generators is k.sub.A
            =k.sub.L 2, both the charge density r and the current
            density J should change by 1/k.sub.L 2=1/k.sub.A, ie.
            inversely to the plate area factor k.sub.A. This is indeed
            what is observed at breakdown (Vb), for invariant pressure
            groups 5 and 6, columns H to K, Table 9. The same relation
            however does not apply as a function of the maximum input
            power and lowest sustaining or extinction voltages (columns
            L to O, Table 1), respectively, 676 and 368 V, as the plate
            current density and J/p.sup.2 values of the same groups 5
            and 6 are virtually identical, despite the invariant
            pressure and the k.sub.A =k.sub.L 2 area factor between the
            two pulse generators. </p>
          <p align="left">Examples of typical average electrode current
            densities encountered in the PAGD regime are shown in Table
            10 for different area aluminum plates, as a function of the
            input current. Electrode J values vary from 10.sup.-2
            A/m.sup.2 to 10.sup.3 A/m.sup.2. </p>

          <p align="left">Determination of the videographed equatorial
            diameter of the inner core of the cathode plasma ball at the
            base of each PAGD channel allowed us to approximate grossly
            the emission area per pulse and the pulse current density at
            the emitter surface, utilizing a reactor (#1 of Table 1)
            built with H34 aluminum plates. Measurements were taken
            laterally from the extreme infra-red light component alone
            of the pulsed abnormal discharges at fully closed aperture.
          </p>
          <p align="left">At PAGD breakdown voltages (Vb) of 1100 to
            1350, the mean equatorial area of the cathode plasma globule
            was 2.8.+-.0.03 mm.sup.2. At PAGD plateau breakdown (Vb)
            voltages of 700 to 850 volts, the mean equatorial area of
            the cathode PAGD plasma globules were 3.8 and 0.95 mm.sup.2
            with anode and cathode voltages respectively (#4 and 2,
            Table 11). As indicated by the input current progression of
            groups 2 to 5, the mean equatorial area of the cathode
            plasma globule increases with increasing input current (cf
            columns B and C, Table 11). Group 6, Table 11 shows similar
            results for an Alzak cathode. This Videographic
            determination of the mean equatorial area of the cathode
            plasma globule allowed an estimation of the overall emission
            area, and thus the calculation of (uncorrected) emission
            current densities (J.sub.cm), shown in column D, Table 11. </p>
          <p align="left">Autographic analysis of the PAGD-induced
            cathode craters in Alzak plates was performed next, and
            their aspect, average inner diameter and maximal depth were
            determined (device 2 of Table 1) after 30 seconds of
            operation at 500 PPS, Only isolated craters were measured,
            following the autograph method of Daalder (Daalder, J. E.
            (1974) "Diameter and current density of single and multiple
            cathode discharges in vacuum", IEEE Trans Power Appar Syst,
            PAS-93:1747). The PAGD operation, at levels where Vb and Vx
            were very close, showed a discharge that, despite the
            smoothness of the surface, tended to move over most of the
            cathode, with the highest concentration of emission craters
            found at the lateral edges. After PAGD operation, two types
            and sizes of craters could be observed: </p>
          <p align="left">1) the large type, or primary craters, which
            had an average inner diameter of 0.28.+-.0.03 mm and a mean
            area of 0.000615.+-.SE 7*10.sup.-5 cm.sup.2, see group 9,
            Table 11; </p>
          <p align="left">2) smaller pits, typically distributed
            radially around a major crater or a cluster of these, and
            which have a mean diameter of 5.5 .mu.m. </p>
          <p align="left">The primary craters often occur in discrete
            clusters of 2 to &gt;10 such craters, defining surface
            neighbourhood regions of PAGD emission where the discharge
            repetitively struck. The inner or bottom circular area of
            the primary craters characteristically shows a twirl or
            swirling pattern of molten metal along one of its diameters
            with solidified metal droplets scattered about. Gross
            macroscopic examination of these craters exhibits a whitish
            periphery. </p>
          <p align="left">A comparison of the emission area values
            obtained by the autographic method of crater size
            determination and the videographic method of measuring the
            equatorial cathode ball diameter, indicates a substantial
            divergence between them, and the resultant estimation of the
            current density at the primary emission site. The reason for
            the discrepancy between the two methods appears to be due to
            the emission structure encountered micrographically: even
            though measurements of the luminous emission globules did
            not include the zones of less intense luminosity (the
            fringe), metallographic examination showed that each focus
            of emission had a multiplicity of minor emission craters
            associated with it; these secondary craters were dispersed
            in a radius of three to four primary crater diameters from
            the primary crater's center, and they thereby increased the
            total area involved in associated emission to an average of
            0.037 cm.sup.2. This corresponds rather well to the obtained
            videographic value of an area of 0.044 cm.sup.2 for the
            cathode plasma globules in Alzak plates, (group 6 of Table
            11) as measured on the cathode that was later disassembled
            for autographic analysis. Typically, the videographic method
            over estimates the area of primary emission site by 62 to
            88.times.. The two methods thus identify distinct structures
            of the emission process: whereas the metallographic method
            identifies primary emission sites, the videographic method
            identifies the overall area of the emission complex which
            includes the secondary craters associated with the primary
            emission site. Due to these findings, and based upon the
            metallographic measurements, a general correction factor of
            75.times. was applied to determine the PAGD emission areas
            and current densities at the primary emission site measured
            videographically, as shown in group #'s 1 to 6, columns F to
            H, Table 11. These values correspond well with the values
            obtained, for the same type of plate material, by the
            metallographic method (compare for example group 6 with
            group 9), to the advantage of the videographic method which
            does not require disassembly of the reactor. With this
            approach, PAGD primary emission site current densities as
            low as 1 to 2.5*10.sup.5 have been measured. </p>
          <p align="left">Autographic analysis of the PAGD-induced
            cathode craters in H34 plates was equally performed, and
            their average inner diameter and maximal depth determined,
            examples of which are given in groups 7 and 8, Table 11. The
            secondary craters characteristically found in Alzak plates,
            along fracture lines radiating from the main crater, are
            absent in H34 plates; instead, in H34 plates, one observes a
            roughened surface surrounding the emission crater, quite
            distinct from the original rough aspect of the pulled finish
            of these hardened aluminum plates. Also unlike the Alzak
            main craters, the H34 craters often have a convex center
            occupied by a cooled molten metal droplet, whereas the Alzak
            craters had a concave, hollowed out aspect. </p>
          <p align="left">With the data obtained by the metallographic
            method of crater measurement, we estimated the volume of
            metal ejected from the cathode, by assuming that the crater
            represents a concavity analogous to a spherical segment
            having a single base (1/6.pi.*H 3r.sup.2 +H.sup.2 !, where H
            is the height of the spherical segment and r the radius of
            the sphere), while disregarding the volume of the central
            droplet leftover from the emission. The following are mean
            crater diameters (D), crater depths (H) and volumes (V) of
            ejected metallic material for two types of aluminum
            cathodes, Alzak and H34 hardened aluminum, subject to a high
            input current PAGD: </p>
          <p align="left">1--Alzak:D-0.028 cm.+-.0.003; H-0.002
            cm.+-.0.0002; V-6.2*10.sup.-7 cm.sup.3 ; </p>
          <p align="left">2--H34:D-0.0115 cm.+-.0.0004;
            H-0.0006.+-.0.0001; V-3.1*10.sup.-8 cm.sup.3 ; </p>
          <p align="left">These data indicate that, on the basis of the
            input currents, the PAGD reactors do not reach the critical
            value of about 7*10.sup.8 A/m.sup.2 ie the threshold
            required by the Fowler-Nordheim theory for field emission.
            Nonetheless, auto-electronic emission is occurring, at low
            applied fields and low emission current densities. Based on
            measurements of the peak pulse current developed by the
            reactor, there is an anomalous reaction current set up
            within the reactor. This is exemplified in FIG. 18B. These
            anomalous reaction currents may be as low as 100 mA but,
            under conditions of most interest, are of the order of 0.5
            to &gt;200 A. On the basis of this anomalous reaction
            current phenomenon, primary emission current densities of
            the order of 10.sup.7 to 10.sup.9 A/m.sup.2 can be
            calculated. </p>
          <p align="left">Low Field Emission </p>
          <p align="left">Unlike prior art planar or coaxial electrode
            discharge devices (eg Boetcher, U.S. Pat. No. 3,663,855;
            Conrad, U.S. Pat. No. 4,764,394; Alexandrovich, et al, U.S.
            Pat. No. 3,821,580; Dethlefsen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,126,638),
            which utilize short gap and high field primary or trigger
            discharges (typically &gt;100,000 V/m), the PAGD reactors
            are essentially low breakdown field devices with long gaps,
            and which advantageously employ the area effect to reduce
            the field strength, as described previously with reference
            to FIG. 11. Typical examples of the values of the PAGD
            breakdown fields at various negative pressures, for aluminum
            and nickel cathodes of reactors that were sealed (at
            diffusion pump vacua) or pumped down (by rotary pump
            action), are shown in Table 12. The breakdown field values
            mostly range from 5,000 to about 30,000 V/m. Similar ranges
            are shown in FIG. 11 where PAGD breakdown fields can be seen
            to vary from a minimum of 2,730-5,090 V/m to a maximum of
            15,640 V/m. (Extinction field values may be as low as 1,000
            to 2,000 V/m.) As previously discussed, the breakdown field
            value is modulated by the voltage reduction area effect, the
            interelectrode gap distance and the residual gas pressure in
            the gap. Generally, increasing the gap distance increases
            the required field strength. The voltage reduction effect of
            large area electrodes appears to be mainly responsible for
            the low field breakdown characteristics of the
            self-generating auto-electronic emissions encountered in the
            PAGD regime. Field-emission theory typically requires a very
            high breakdown field value, greater than 2*10.sup.9 V/m, for
            auto-electronic emission (eg in a VAD). Disregarding
            momentarily the fact that the PAGD has a positive I/V.sup.2
            slope and taking its cathode- or anode-supplied voltage
            intercepts (0.0005 and 0.00005, respectively) to calculate
            the field-enhancement factor .beta. required by the
            field-emission theory to explain the unpredicted
            auto-electronic emissions observed in the PAGD regime, we
            end up with .beta. values of the order of 10.sup.6 to
            10.sup.7 (for actual fields of 15,000 V/m), if we were to
            assume, incorrectly, that the long gap PAGD operates like a
            (short-gap) VAD. Indeed, what is remarkable about the PAGD
            regime in these reactors is the very low (&gt;10.sup.5 -fold
            lower) values of the fields required for the PAGD
            transduction of high current densities, a phenomenon that
            actually occurs during known VAD regimes (cold cathode or
            thermionic), but typically only at 10.sup.2 -fold lower
            values than those required and predicted by the
            field-emission theory (Farrail, G. A. (1980) "Electrical
            breakdown in vacuum", in `Vacuum arcs, theory and
            application`, Lafferty, J. M., ed , p 20 &amp; f, J. Wiley

          <p align="left">Pulse Input Energy </p>
          <p align="left">Pulse input energy was determined for a
            variety of conditions (pressure, gap, electrode area,
            residual gas, input current and input voltage, duration of
            input pulse, cathode material, etc) and typical examples are
            presented in Table 13. In the PAGD regime, input pulse
            duration and corresponding duty cycle are self-regulated
            events dependent upon the frequency controlling factors
            already discussed, and thus the input pulse times shown in
            Table 13 are spontaneous and not externally determined, as
            would be the case for interrupted vacuum-arc discharges
            (IVADs). As a function of the input power characteristics,
            input energy per pulse in the PAGD regime ranged from as low
            as 1 mJ to &gt;112 J (Table 13). Values as high as 250
            J/PAGD input energy have been determined without slippage to
            a VAD regime for typical 5-8 cm gap, 4 to 128 cm.sup.2 plate
            reactors. Under the same conditions, higher values will
            promote slippage of the PAGD into the VAD regime. However,
            higher values should be possible with still larger electrode
            spacing and higher input currents (eg 4 to 10 A). </p>

            pulse, respectively, columns A to C, ordered vertically by
            increasing input energy, are shown in Table 14. The data was
            obtained with plate reactors of 4 to 128 cm.sup.2 cathode
            areas, gaps of 5 to 8 cm, at different pressures (in air or
            argon) and PPS rates of 0.1 to 110 (column D, Table 14). Two
            separate types of associated circuits were utilized to
            measure the output energy per pulse (column C, Table 14): </p>
          <p align="left">1) In a double diode configuration,
            oscillographic reactor measurements for groups 1 to 3, Table
            6, were taken at the junctions of the cathodes with
            capacitors 10a and 10b (FIG. 21A), and at the junction of
            the axial anode with another capacitor placed prior to the
            center tap of transformer 26, in series with both parallel
            capacitors 10a and 10b. Coils 26a and 26b of transformer 26
            were replaced by a third series capacitor intermediate
            parallel capacitors 10a and 10b, and oscillographic AC
            output readings taken across this capacitor (groups 1 to 3,
            Table 14); the total series capacitance was 5.3 .mu.F. </p>
          <p align="left">2) In a single diode configuration,
            oscillographic reactor measurements for groups 4 to 14,
            Table 6, were taken at the junctions of the cathode with
            capacitor C3, and of the anode with capacitor C5 (see FIG. 9
            of our copending U.S. application No. 08/054,111 entitled
            "Energy Conversion System"), and oscillographic or long-term
            DC output readings were determined at the input to the
            battery pack CP; the C3/C5 series capacitance was 17.5 mF. </p>
          <p align="left">Two conclusions, independently from all other
            varying conditions, may be taken from the data of Table 14:
            the pulse energy released within the reactor varies from
            &lt;3 to &gt;50.times. the input energy per pulse (column A
            vs columns B and C); and, in general, the reactor energy
            varies inversely to the pulse frequency (columns B and C, vs
            column D). In other experiments, reactor energies per pulse
            have been observed to reach &gt;500 J. Given that the
            reactor pulse voltage (Vp) is determined by the extinction
            voltage Vx (Vp=Vb-Vx) and thus cannot reach the amplitude of
            the breakdown voltage Vb, this involution of energy observed
            per pulse in the reactor and at its output indicates that it
            is a current amplification phenomenon. Indeed, with input
            currents of 1.2 to 1.7 A and input pulse energies of 1 to 30
            J, peak pulse reactor currents have been observed to reach
            &gt;150 A. </p>
          <p align="left">Dynamic Capacitance of PAGD Reactors </p>
          <p align="left">The static capacitance of typical reactors has
            been discussed in Example 6. A typical 128 cm.sup.2 plate
            reactor would have a capacitance of the order of 2 pF, and
            at an applied 560 V potential, be capable of storing 0.3
            micro-Joules, an infinitesimal quantity of energy (E=0.5 C
            V.sup.2, where E is in Joules, C in Farads and V in Volts).
            With a typical pulse input energy injection of 5 to 15 J,
            the reactor will develop 25 to &gt;400 J per pulse; under
            these conditions at pulse reactor voltages (Vp) of 100 to
            500, the dynamic capacitance of the discharge tube will
            range from 0.2 to 80 mF. </p>
          <p align="left">Anomalous Reaction Forces in the PAGD Regime </p>
          <p align="left">Determinations of the anomalous cathode
            reaction forces in the PAGD regime was carried out utilizing
            the reactor pulse energy or the pulse output energy,
            together with the metallographic data or by measuring the
            force in a reaction balance. The kinetic energy of each
            pulse was determined either directly, by integration of
            oscilloscopic pulse profiles, or indirectly, by long-term
            resistive discharge measurements of the batteries storing
            output power. The cathode material utilized for these
            experiments had a density of 1.86 g/cm.sup.3. For a mean net
            pulse output energy of 86.4 J (Net energy out=output reactor
            energy-input reactor energy), or 24 mWh, and a mean volume
            of cathode metal ejected of the order of 3.1*10.sup.-8
            cm.sup.3, a single PAGD releases 5.8*10.sup.-8 g of metal in
            40 to 50 msec, or 1.3*10.sup.15 Al ions. Accordingly, the
            calculated kinetic energy of each Al ion leaving the cathode
            is quite high, of the order of 4.8*10.sup.5 eV, more than
            three orders of magnitude that typically found in VADs
            (Tanberg, R (1930) "On the cathode of an arc drawn in
            vacuum", Phys Rev, 35:1080; Kobel, E (1930) "Pressure and
            high vapour jets at the cathodes of a mercury vacuum arc",
            Phys Rev, 36:707; Plyutto, A. A. et al (1965) "High speed
            plasma streams in vacuum arcs", Sov Phys J Exp Theor Phys,
            20:328). Under these conditions of PAGD production and
            measurement, the energy density of the Al cathode being
            operated in a PAGD reactor, is of the order of 2.8*10.sup.9
            J/cm.sup.3, only three orders of magnitude less than the
            energy density value of the energy priming the vacuum, as
            calculated by Aspden ("Gravitation", 1975 p.61).
            Corresponding rms vapor velocity of the ejected Al ions was
            1.7*10.sup.8 cm/sec. Utilizing Tanberg's formula for the
            reaction force F.sub.R in dynes (F.sub.R =m*V/1.39), such a
            typical PAGD deploys an anomalous reaction force of 143.6
            dynes. Determination of the anomalous ion force by reaction
            weight measurement, under similar conditions, yielded 245.2
            dynes. Anomalous cathode reaction forces &gt;300 dynes have
            been observed in other PAGD experiments (with pulse output
            energies of 25 to &gt;100 mWh). </p>
          <p align="left">In referring to the anomalous reaction forces
            present in VADs (Tanberg's and Kobel's work), Aspden has
            suggested a proportionality of the order of 100*i.sup.2
            (where i is input current in real units), for the
            electrodynamic action observed in these experiments (Aspden,
            H (1969) "The law of electrodynamics", J Franklin Inst,
            287:197). Graneau et al (Graneau, P &amp; Graneau, P. N.
            (1985) "Electrodynamic explosions in liquids", Appl Phys
            Lett, 46:470; Azevedo, R et al (1986) "Powerful water-plasma
            explosions", Phys Lett A, 117:101), in their calculation of
            the average acceleration force for water-plasma arcs
            (F.sub.av =(.mu..sub.o /4.pi.)(k*i.sup.2), where .mu..sub.o
            is the permeability constant of the vacuum in Henrys per
            meter, and the force is in Newtons) have utilized k as a
            figure of merit for the strength of the explosions observed.
            As may be seen from Table 15, the k values of the PAGD are
            very high (100.times. higher than those observed in VAD
            studies, compare VAD groups 1 to 3 with PAGD groups 6 and 7,
            Table 15), and are comparable to those calculated by Graneau
            et al for water-plasma arc explosions. Yet, the PAGD input
            current values are the lowest of all groups. Following
            Aspden's interpretation of the law of electrodynamic action,
            the PAGD k values are found to be in the range prescribed by
            the ion/electron mass differential for Al ions (49,185),
            which lies in the 10.sup.4 range. </p>
          <p align="left">Work-function of Cathode Material </p>
          <p align="left">Based upon data for the PAGD performance of
            diverse cathode materials presented above in Table 8,
            together with Pauling's tabulation of element
            electronegativities (Electronegativity X=0.44o-0.15, where o
            is the work-function of the element (Lange's Handbook of
            Chemistry", 1979 McGraw-Hill Book Co, N.Y., N.Y., p 3-11)),
            we determined the PAGD affinity of diverse cathodes to
            decrease with increasing element electronegativity (C) and
            cathode work-function (o), as shown in Table 16. The lower
            the work-function of the cathode metal utilized, the greater
            is the observed PAGD affinity. It is expected that materials
            with work-functions of &lt;1.5, such as Li, Be, Mg, Cs, etc,
            will support PAGD production better than Al does. Tungsten
            (W) was the only material tested not in plates but in thin
            rods. No correlation of PAGD production affinity with any
            other physical parameters considered (eg atomic electron
            affinities, ionization potentials, atomic weight, density,
            melting and boiling points, thermal conductivity and
            electrical resistivity) was found, except that the two best
            PAGD cathode emitters had the lowest melting points and
            densities of all cathodes examined. </p>
          <p align="left">Typical Expected Cathode Lifetimes </p>
          <p align="left">Utilizing plates composed of either hardened
            aluminum or Alzak material with 3 mm of thickness, and thus
            with a volume of 38.4 cm.sup.3 per plate and considering
            that only 2/3rds of the cathode shall be used (a 2 mm layer
            out of the 3 mm thickness), the total number of pulses per
            plate total (TLT) and partial (PLT) lifetimes is
            theoretically: </p>
          <p align="left">1--Alzak: TLT: 6.2*10.sup.7 pulses; PLT:
            4.1*10.sup.7 pulses; </p>
          <p align="left">2--H34: TLT: 1.2*10.sup.9 pulses; PLT:
            8.1*10.sup.8 pulses; </p>
          <p align="left">Typically, a H34 device can produce about 0.25
            kWh per 10,000 pulses. The corresponding value for a PLT is
            thus a minimum of 1.0 MWh/Alzak cathode and of 20 MWh/H34
            cathode. As the cathode for each combination is only 66.7%
            consumed, the vacuum pulse generator may continue to be used
            in a reverse configuration, by utilizing the other plate in
            turn as the cathode; thus, the minimal values become,
            respectively, 2.0 MWh/Alzak pulse generator and 40 MWh/H34
            pulse generator. The same rationale applies if the
            configuration utilized was that of the double diode. </p>
          <p align="left">A summary of the typical specifications of
            PAGD reactors is presented in Table 17, though its values
            should not be construed as limits to the phenomenon such as
            it might manifest itself in other conditions. </p>
          <p align="left">Unlike other discharge tubes in prior art (eg
            Manuel, U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,316; Boetcher, U.S. Pat. No.
            3,663,855; Conrad, U.S. Pat. No. 4,764,394; Alexandrovich,
            et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,821,580; Dethlefsen, U.S. Pat. No.
            5,126,638), which must be triggered by an external pulse
            generator, the PAGD reactor is the oscillator component in
            any of the pulse generator circuits discussed. Essentially,
            the PAGD reactor is a low breakdown field oscillator that
            does not require a trigger electrode, nor any external
            shaping of the applied current or voltage, which is simply
            DC. In distinction from the externally pulsed abnormal glow
            discharge described by Manuel in U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,316,
            the PAGD regime is a self-pulsed or self-generated, and
            self-regulated discharge method. In fact, with the
            appropriate input resistance, a PAGD reactor, as described,
            will operate in the PAGD regime autogenously, in the absence
            of any parallel capacitance, and utilizing a battery pack as
            a power source. This application describes the physical and
            operational parameters necessary to configure a vacuum
            discharge tube to elicit self-generating discharges, and
            thus be self-pulsed, in the PAGD plasma regime, directly
            from a direct current supply. </p>
          <p align="left">Unlike prior art glow discharge tubes that are
            fundamentally flash over devices that do not employ any form
            of emission (eg Manuel, U.S. Pat. No. 3,471,316; Conrad,
            U.S. Pat. No. 4,764,394), the discharge has both a glow and
            auto-electronic emission components. Unlike VAD tubes (eg
            Boetcher, U.S. Pat. No. 3,663,855; Alexandrovich, et al,
            U.S. Pat. No. 3,821,580), the cold cathode PAGD
            auto-electronic emission pulse is not triggered externally,
            but a spontaneous occurrence observed at low breakdown
            fields, with emitter current densities 10 to 1000.times.
            lower than those required by the Fowler-Nordheim theory for
            field emission. </p>
          <p align="left">As already observed in prior art VAD devices
            (eg Tanberg's or Kobel's papers referenced above), anomalous
            cathode reaction forces are set up in the PAGD reactors;
            however, with input currents one or two orders of magnitude
            less than needed for a VAD, the PAGD-associated reaction
            forces manifest a proportionality constant that is 10 to 100
            times higher than found for VADS (10.sup.3 to 10.sup.4
            *i.sup.2 vs 10.sup.2 *i.sup.2). These forces may account for
            the low input current densities observed in the PAGD regime.
            Evidently, as with the PAGD regime itself, these reaction
            forces result from the specific physical and operational
            parameters employed, amongst which the large gaps, large
            electrode areas, cold cathode status, cathode low worth
            function and low breakdown fields figure prominently. <br>
