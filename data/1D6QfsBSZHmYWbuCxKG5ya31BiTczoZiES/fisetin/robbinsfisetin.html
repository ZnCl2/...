      </b>Fisetin, is a plant polyphenol from the flavonoid group. It
      can be found in many plants, where it serves as a colouring agent.
      It is also found in many fruits and vegetables, such as
      strawberries, apples, persimmons, onions and cucumbers.<br>

        <i>Natural product found to reduce the level of damaged cells in
          the body, caused by aging</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Summary:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; Previous research showed it was
      possible to reduce the burden of damaged cells, termed senescent
      cells, and extend lifespan and improve health, even when treatment
      was initiated late in life. <br>
      <br>
      They now have shown that treatment of aged mice with the natural
      product Fisetin, found in many fruits and vegetables, also has
      significant positive effects on health and lifespan. <br>
      <br>
      Previous research published earlier this year in Nature Medicine
      involving University of Minnesota Medical School faculty Paul D.
      Robbins and Laura J. Niedernhofer and Mayo Clinic investigators
      James L. <br>
      <br>
      Kirkland and Tamara Tchkonia, showed it was possible to reduce the
      burden of damaged cells, termed senescent cells, and extend
      lifespan and improve health, even when treatment was initiated
      late in life. <br>
      <br>
      They now have shown that treatment of aged mice with the natural
      product Fisetin, found in many fruits and vegetables, also has
      significant positive effects on health and lifespan.<br>
      <br>
      As people age, they accumulate damaged cells. When the cells get
      to a certain level of damage they go through an aging process of
      their own, called cellular senescence. The cells also release
      inflammatory factors that tell the immune system to clear those
      damaged cells. A younger person's immune system is healthy and is
      able to clear the damaged cells. But as people age, they aren't
      cleared as effectively. Thus they begin to accumulate, cause low
      level inflammation and release enzymes that can degrade the
      tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Robbins and fellow researchers found a natural product, called
      Fisetin, reduces the level of these damaged cells in the body.
      They found this by treating mice towards the end of life with this
      compound and see improvement in health and lifespan. The paper,
      "Fisetin is a senotherapeutic that extends health and lifespan,"
      was recently published in EBioMedicine.<br>
      <br>
      "These results suggest that we can extend the period of health,
      termed healthspan, even towards the end of life," said Robbins.
      "But there are still many questions to address, including the
      right dosage, for example."<br>
      <br>
      One question they can now answer, however, is why haven't they
      done this before? There were always key limitations when it came
      to figuring out how a drug will act on different tissues,
      different cells in an aging body. Researchers didn't have a way to
      identify if a treatment was actually attacking the particular
      cells that are senescent, until now.<br>
      <br>
      Under the guidance of Edgar Arriaga, a professor in the Department
      of Chemistry in the College of Science and Engineering at the
      University of Minnesota, the team used mass cytometry, or CyTOF,
      technology and applied it for the first time in aging research,
      which is unique to the University of Minnesota.<br>
      <br>
      "In addition to showing that the drug works, this is the first
      demonstration that shows the effects of the drug on specific
      subsets of these damaged cells within a given tissue." Robbins
      said.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Senescence is a tumor suppressor mechanism activated in stressed
      cells to prevent replication of damaged DNA. Senescent cells have
      been demonstrated to play a causal role in driving aging and
      age-related diseases using genetic and pharmacologic approaches.
      We previously demonstrated that the combination of dasatinib and
      the flavonoid quercetin is a potent senolytic improving numerous
      age-related conditions including frailty, osteoporosis and
      cardiovascular disease. The goal of this study was to identify
      flavonoids with more potent senolytic activity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A panel of flavonoid polyphenols was screened for senolytic
      activity using senescent murine and human fibroblasts, driven by
      oxidative and genotoxic stress, respectively. The top
      senotherapeutic flavonoid was tested in mice modeling a progeroid
      syndrome carrying a p16INK4a-luciferase reporter and aged
      wild-type mice to determine the effects of fisetin on senescence
      markers, age-related histopathology, disease markers, health span
      and lifespan. Human adipose tissue explants were used to determine
      if results translated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Findings</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Of the 10 flavonoids tested, fisetin was the most potent
      senolytic. Acute or intermittent treatment of progeroid and old
      mice with fisetin reduced senescence markers in multiple tissues,
      consistent with a hit-and-run senolytic mechanism. Fisetin reduced
      senescence in a subset of cells in murine and human adipose
      tissue, demonstrating cell-type specificity. Administration of
      fisetin to wild-type mice late in life restored tissue
      homeostasis, reduced age-related pathology, and extended median
      and maximum lifespan.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Interpretation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The natural product fisetin has senotherapeutic activity in mice
      and in human tissues. Late life intervention was sufficient to
      yield a potent health benefit. These characteristics suggest the
      feasibility to translation to human clinical studies.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is rarely addressed in the context of
      aging even though there is an overlap in pathology. We previously
      used a phenotypic screening platform based on old age-associated
      brain toxicities to identify the flavonol fisetin as a potential
      therapeutic for AD and other age-related neurodegenerative
      diseases. Based on earlier results with fisetin in transgenic AD
      mice, we hypothesized that fisetin would be effective against
      brain aging and cognitive dysfunction in rapidly aging
      senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, a model for sporadic
      AD and dementia. An integrative approach was used to correlate
      protein expression and metabolite levels in the brain with
      cognition. It was found that fisetin reduced cognitive deficits in
      old SAMP8 mice while restoring multiple markers associated with
      impaired synaptic function, stress, and inflammation. These
      results provide further evidence for the potential benefits of
      fisetin for the treatment of age-related neurodegenerative
      diseases.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Senescent cells accumulate with aging and at sites of pathology in
      multiple chronic diseases. Senolytics are drugs that selectively
      promote apoptosis of senescent cells by temporarily disabling the
      pro-survival pathways that enable senescent cells to resist the
      pro-apoptotic, pro-inflammatory factors that they themselves
      secrete. Reducing senescent cell burden by genetic approaches or
      by administering senolytics delays or alleviates multiple age- and
      disease-related adverse phenotypes in preclinical models. Reported
      senolytics include dasatinib, quercetin, navitoclax (ABT263), and
      piperlongumine. Here we report that fisetin, a naturally-occurring
      flavone with low toxicity, and A1331852 and A1155463, selective
      BCL-XL inhibitors that may have less hematological toxicity than
      the less specific BCL-2 family inhibitor navitoclax, are
      senolytic. Fisetin selectively induces apoptosis in senescent but
      not proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).
      It is not senolytic in senescent IMR90 cells, a human lung
      fibroblast strain, or primary human preadipocytes. A1331852 and
      A1155463 are senolytic in HUVECs and IMR90 cells, but not
      preadipocytes. These agents may be better candidates for eventual
      translation into clinical interventions than some existing
      senolytics, such as navitoclax, which is associated with
      hematological toxicity.<br>
