      The results of a recent study are offering new hope that avoiding
      memory loss related to aging as well as Alzheimer’s disease could
      be as simple as eating more cucumbers.<br>
      <br>
      Many older adults resign themselves to memory loss as part of the
      aging process. However, a study out of the the Salk Institute for
      Biological Studies has shown that this doesn’t have to be the
      case. The health benefits of cucumbers are many, and one of them
      seems to be better memory and even the prevention of Alzheimer’s
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers working with mice that normally developed the symptoms
      of Alzheimer’s (including memory loss) discovered that a daily
      dose of a flavonol called fisetin prevented these and other
      related impairments. This improvement occurred despite the
      continued formation of amyloid plaques, the brain proteins
      commonly blamed for Alzheimer’s.<br>
      <br>
      The compound fisetin is found in numerous vegetables and fruits
      but is especially concentrated in strawberries and cucumbers. This
      flavonol is quite effective in stopping memory loss in mice and
      holds hope for humans as well...<br>
      <br>
      Fisetin works by switching on a cellular pathway associated with
      the process of retrieving memories in the brain. Over a decade
      ago, other researchers discovered the compound fisetin assists in
      protecting the neurons of the brain from aging and its associated
      effects. It was found that this potent compound has both
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects on brain cells..<br>

      <br>
      A daily dose of the antioxidant fisetin keeps mice—even those with
      genetic mutations linked to Alzheimer's—from experiencing memory
      and learning deficits as they age.<br>
      <br>
      A chemical that’s found in fruits and vegetables from strawberries
      to cucumbers appears to stop memory loss that accompanies
      Alzheimer’s disease in mice, scientists at the Salk Institute for
      Biological Studies have discovered. In experiments on mice that
      normally develop Alzheimer’s symptoms less than a year after
      birth, a daily dose of the compound—a flavonol called
      fisetin—prevented the progressive memory and learning impairments.
      The drug, however, did not alter the formation of amyloid plaques
      in the brain, accumulations of proteins which are commonly blamed
      for Alzheimer’s disease. The new finding suggests a way to treat
      Alzheimer’s symptoms independently of targeting amyloid plaques.<br>
      <br>
      “We had already shown that in normal animals, fisetin can improve
      memory,” says Pamela Maher, a senior staff scientist in Salk’s
      Cellular Neurobiology Laboratory who led the new study. “What we
      showed here is that it also can have an effect on animals prone to
      Alzheimer’s.”<br>
      <br>
      More than a decade ago, Maher discovered that fisetin helps
      protect neurons in the brain from the effects of aging. She and
      her colleagues have since—in both isolated cell cultures and mouse
      studies—probed how the compound has both antioxidant and
      anti-inflammatory effects on cells in the brain. Most recently,
      they found that fisetin turns on a cellular pathway known to be
      involved in memory.<br>
      <br>
      “What we realized is that fisetin has a number of properties that
      we thought might be beneficial when it comes to Alzheimer’s,” says
      Maher.<br>
      <br>
      So Maher — who works with Dave Schubert, the head of the Cellular
      Neurobiology Lab — turned to a strain of mice that have mutations
      in two genes linked to Alzheimer’s disease. The researchers took a
      subset of these mice and, when they were only three months old,
      began adding fisetin to their food. As the mice aged, the
      researchers tested their memory and learning skills with water
      mazes. By nine months of age, mice that hadn’t received fisetin
      began performing more poorly in the mazes. Mice that had gotten a
      daily dose of the compound, however, performed as well as normal
      mice, at both nine months and a year old.<br>
      <br>
      “Even as the disease would have been progressing, the fisetin was
      able to continue preventing symptoms,” Maher says.<br>
      <br>
      In collaboration with scientists at the University of California,
      San Diego, Maher’s team next tested the levels of different
      molecules in the brains of mice that had received doses of fisetin
      and those that hadn’t. In mice with Alzheimer’s symptoms, they
      found, pathways involved in cellular inflammation were turned on.
      In the animals that had taken fisetin, those pathways were
      dampened and anti-inflammatory molecules were present instead. One
      protein in particular—known as p35—was blocked from being cleaved
      into a shorter version when fisetin was taken. The shortened
      version of p35 is known to turn on and off many other molecular
      pathways. The results were published December 17, 2013, in the
      journal Aging Cell.<br>
      <br>
      Studies on isolated tissue had hinted that fisetin might also
      decrease the number of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s affected
      brains. However, that observation didn’t hold up in the mice
      studies. “Fisetin didn’t affect the plaques,” says Maher. “It
      seems to act on other pathways that haven’t been seriously
      investigated in the past as therapeutic targets.”<br>
      <br>
      Next, Maher’s team hopes to understand more of the molecular
      details on how fisetin affects memory, including whether there are
      targets other than p35.<br>
      <br>
      “It may be that compounds like this that have more than one target
      are most effective at treating Alzheimer’s disease,” says Maher,
      “because it’s a complex disease where there are a lot of things
      going wrong.”<br>
      <br>
      They also aim to develop new studies to look at how the timing of
      fisetin doses affect its influence on Alzheimer’s.<br>
      <br>
      “The model that we used here was a preventive model,” explains
      Maher. “We started the mice on the drugs before they had any
      memory loss. But obviously human patients don’t go to the doctor
      until they are already having memory problems.” So the next step
      in moving the discovery toward the clinic, she says, is to test
      whether fisetin can reverse declines in memory once they have
      already appeared.<br>
      <br>
      Other researchers on the paper were Antonio Currais, Marguerite
      Prior, Richard Dargusch, Jennifer Ehren, and David Schubert of the
      Salk Institute and Aaron Armando and Oswald Quehenberger of the
      University of California at San Diego...<br>

      Nutraceutical formulations that improve cognitive function in
      adults diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease are provided,
      which comprise a combination of fisetin and DHA.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder of the brain.
      It is the leading cause of dementia in elderly persons. AD
      patients have increased problems with memory loss and intellectual
      functions which progress to the point where they cannot function
      as normal individuals. With the loss of intellectual skills the
      patients exhibit personality changes, socially inappropriate
      actions and schizophrenia. AD is devastating for both victims and
      their families, for currently there is no effective palliative or
      preventive treatment for the inevitable neurodegeneration.<br>
      <br>
      At a macroscopic level, the brains of AD patients are usually
      smaller, sometimes weighing less than 1,000 grams. At a
      microscopic level, the histopathological hallmarks of AD include
      neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuritic plaques, and degeneration
      of neurons. AD patients exhibit degeneration of nerve cells in the
      frontal and temporal cortex of the cerebral cortex, pyramidal
      neurons of the hippocampus, neurons in the medial, medial central,
      and cortical nuclei of the amygdala, noradrenergic neurons in the
      locus coeruleus, and the neurons in the basal forebrain
      cholinergic system. Loss of neurons in the cholinergic system
      leads to a consistent deficit in cholinergic presynaptic markers
      in AD.<br>
      <br>
      The microtubule-associated protein known as Tau has been
      implicated in Alzheimers disease etiology. Tau binds to
      microtubules and assists with their formation and stabilization.
      However when tau is hyperphosphorylated, it is unable to bind and
      the microtubules become unstable and begin disintegrating. The
      unbound tau clumps together in formations called neurofibrillary
      tangles. More explicitly, intracellular lesions known as
      pretangles develop when tau is phosphorylated excessively and on
      improper amino acid residues. These lesions, over time, develop
      into filamentous neurofibrilary tangles (NFTs) which interfere
      with numerous intracellular functions.<br>
      <br>
      Three different maturation states of NFT have been defined using
      anti-tau and anti-ubiquitin immunostaining. At stage 0 there are
      morphologically normal pyramidal cells showing diffuse or fine
      granular cytoplasmic staining with anti-tau. At stage 1 some
      delicate elongate inclusions are stained by tau antibodies; stage
      2 is represented by the classic NFT demonstration with anti-tau
      staining; stage 3 is exemplified by ghost tangles where the host
      neuron has died, which are characterized by a reduced anti-tau but
      marked anti-ubiquitin immunostaining. It has been shown that the
      degree of cognitive impairment in diseases such as AD
      significantly correlates with the presence of neurofibrillary
      tangles.<br>
      <br>
      The development of agents that can decrease cognitive decline,
      which may be a tauopathy, is of great interest for clinical and
      research purposes.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery
      of novel nutraceutical formulations that improve cognitive
      function in adults diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease.
      Diseases of interest include those associated with beta amyloid
      and tau/tangle pathology, which may include cognitive decline with
      aging or Alzheimer's disease, frontal temporal dementia, Pick's,
      and progressive supranuclear palsy. The compositions of the
      invention provide a combined dose of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
      and fisetin effective in slowing or treating cognitive decline.<br>
      <br>
      The novel formulations include a combination of fisetin and DHA,
      which unexpectedly behaves synergistically. Accordingly, the
      formulations of the invention provide a novel therapeutic approach
      for improving cognition, for example in aging adults and in adults
      diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease. The invention features,
      in a first aspect, methods of improving cognitive performance in a
      subject, comprising administering to the subject a nutraceutical
      formulation or composition of the invention. In an exemplary
      embodiment, the subject has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's
      Disease.<br>
      <br>
      Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent
      from the following detailed description, and from the claims.<br>

      <b>DEFINITIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The compositions of the present invention can be formulated
      according to known methods to prepare pharmaceutically and
      nutraceutically useful compositions, whereby these materials, or
      their functional derivatives, are combined in admixture with a
      pharmaceutically or nutraceutically acceptable carrier vehicle.
      Suitable pharmaceutical vehicles and their formulation, inclusive
      of other human proteins, e.g., human serum albumin, are described,
      for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (16.sup.th
      ed., Osol, A. ed., Mack Easton Pa. (1980)). In order to form a
      pharmaceutically acceptable composition suitable for effective
      administration, such compositions will contain an effective amount
      of the above-described compounds together with a suitable amount
      of carrier vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      An effective amount varies depending upon the health and physical
      condition of the subject to be treated, the taxonomic group of
      subjects to be treated (e.g. human, nonhuman primate, etc.), the
      capacity of the subject's nervous system, the degree of protection
      desired, the treating doctor's assessment of the medical
      situation, the condition to be treated or prevented, and other
      relevant factors.<br>
      <br>
      Before the present compositions and methods are described in
      further detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not
      limited to particular methods described, as such may, of course,
      vary. It is also to be understood that unless stated otherwise,
      the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing
      particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting.<br>
      <br>
      Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each
      intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit
      unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper
      and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening
      value in that stated range, is encompassed within the invention.
      The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may
      independently be included in the smaller ranges, subject to any
      specifically excluded limit in the stated range.<br>
      <br>
      The publications discussed herein are provided solely for their
      disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application.
      Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present
      invention is not entitled to antedate such publication by virtue
      of prior invention. Further, the dates of publication provided may
      be different from the actual publication dates, which may need to

      <br>
      Fisetin (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroxy-4H-chromen-4-one)
      is a yellow flavonoid polyphenol present at very low quantities in
      many foods, notably strawberries. Like resveratrol, it has been
      reported as a sirtuin-activating compound. Like many other
      polyphenols, it has pleiotropic antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      activities (see, for example, Geraets et al. (2009) Biochemical
      and Biophysical Research Communications 382 (3): 598-603).<br>
      <br>
      DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid;
      all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexa-enoic acid) is an omega-3
      fatty acid that is a primary structural component of the human
      cerebral cortex, sperm, testicles and retina. It can be
      synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid or obtained directly from
      fish oil.<br>
      <br>
      Cold-water oceanic fish oils are rich in DHA. Most of the DHA in
      fish and multi-cellular organisms with access to cold-water
      oceanic foods originates from photosynthetic and heterotrophic
      microalgae, and becomes increasingly concentrated in organisms the
      further they are up the food chain. DHA is also commercially
      manufactured from microalgae; Crypthecodinium cohnii and another
      of the genus Schizochytrium. In humans, DHA is either obtained
      from the diet or synthesized from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,
      20:5, ω-3) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5 ω-3) as an
      intermediate.<br>
      <br>
      DHA is the most abundant omega-3 fatty acid in the brain and
      retina. DHA comprises 40% of the polyunsaturated fatty acids in
      the brain and 60% of the PUFAs in the retina. Fifty percent of the
      weight of a neuron's plasma membrane is composed of DHA. DHA
      modulates the carrier-mediated transport of choline, glycine, and
      taurine, the function of delayed rectifier potassium channels, and
      the response of rhodopsin contained in the synaptic vesicles,
      among many other functions. DHA deficiency is associated with
      cognitive decline (see Lukiw et al. (2005) J Clin Invest. 115
      (10): 2774-83).<br>
      <br>
      Preliminary studies indicated that DHA can slow the progression of
      Alzhiemer's disease in mice. However, the first large-scale human
      trials showed that DHA alone did not slow decline of mental
      function in elderly people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease (Quinn et al. (2010) JAMA 304 (17): 1903-11). These trials
      were part of a large U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      intervention study to evaluate DHA in Alzheimer's disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed Description Of The Embodiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery
      of novel nutraceutical formulations which improve cognitive
      function, e.g. in adults diagnosed with neurodegenerative disease,
      such as early-stage and mid/late-stage Alzheimer's Disease. The
      development of non-prescription nutraceutical formulations is
      highly desirable as both a preventative measure, as well as to
      augment any pharmacological treatment approaches. Such
      nutraceutical formulations also are useful for normal subjects,
      e.g., normal adults seeking to improve cognitive function.<br>
      <br>
      The nutraceutical formulations described herein contain components
      that synergistically provide neuroprotection against undesirable
      inflammation and development of filamentous neurofibrilary tangles
      (NFTs) which interfere with numerous intracellular functions.
      Co-administration of the components of the nutraceutical
      formulations maintained and/or improved cognitive performance over
      an extended period of time in the animal model 3×AD transgenic
      mice, indicating that the combination of components is useful in
      treating and/or reducing the symptoms associated with AD and other
      taouopathies.<br>
      <br>
      The formulations can be used or administered alone, or together in
      combination with other nutraceutical or pharmaceutical
      compositions. Nutraceutical or pharmaceutical compositions
      suitable for administration in combination with the formulations
      of the invention include nutraceutical or pharmaceutical
      compositions effective in improving cognition or reducing symptoms
      associated with a neurological disorder (e.g., Alzheimer's disease
      and other taouopathies). The compositions of the invention may be
      administered to a mammal, e.g. a mouse, including mouse models for
      neurologic disease, a human, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In some preferred embodiments, the formulation is administered
      orally. In an alternative embodiment, the formulation is
      administered parenterally. In a further embodiment of these
      aspects, the formulation is administered as a unit dosage form. A
      combination product of the invention can be defined based on the
      weights of the two agents per dosage unit. On a weight basis, the
      ratio of fisetin to DHA is usually from about 20:1 to about 1:20;
      from about 10:1 to about 1:10; from about 5:1 to about 1:5; from
      about 2:1 to about 1:2; and in some embodiments is about 1:6,
      about 1:10, about 1:15 or about 1:20.<br>
      <br>
      In an exemplary embodiment, the unit dose of the formulation
      comprises DHA in an amount of at least about 25 mg, at least about
      100 mg, at least about 500 mg, at least about 1 g, at least 2 g,
      at least about 5 g, or at least about 10 g. The unit dose of the
      formulation may comprise fisetin in an amount of at least about 10
      mg, at least about 50 mg, at least about 100 mg, at least about
      250 mg, at least about 500 mg, at least about 1 g, at least about
      2 g, at least about 5 g, or at least about 10 g. Nutraceutical
      formulations can be prepared using methods known in the art.
      Optionally the nutraceutical formulation further comprises one or
      more anti-oxidants in addition to the fisetin and DHA, e.g.
      ascorbic acid, coenzyme Q, etc.<br>
      <br>

      Table 1 sets forth certain preferred embodiments of the instant
      nutraceutical composition with respect to the amounts of DHA and
      fisetin present in the composition. Such composition, which
      preferably is for human oral consumption, is envisioned for daily
      consumption to treat an existing cognitive disorder (e.g., AD) or
      improve cognition in a “normal” subject (i.e., a subject who has
      an as yet undiagnosed cognitive disorder or a subject (preferably
      over the age of 60) who has no cognitive disorder). Additional
      delivery regimens for these compositions include twice per day,
      once every two days, once every three days, and once per week.<br>

      The nutraceutical formulations for use in accordance with the
      present invention can be formulated in a conventional manner using
      one or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients.
      Agents used in the formulations and their physiologically
      acceptable salts and solvates can be prepared for administration
      by various methods. In an exemplary embodiment, administration of
      the formulations is oral (ideally solid or liquid). In an
      alternative embodiment, administration is parenteral, e.g.,
      intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intracranial,
      intraorbital, ophthalmic, intraventricular, intracapsular,
      intraspinal, intracistemal, intraperitoneal, or transmucosal. The
      compositions can be formulated in various ways, according to the
      route of administration.<br>
      <br>
      For oral administration, the formulations can take the form of,
      for example, tablets or capsules, prepared by conventional means
      with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as binding agents
      (for example, pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or
      hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (for example, lactose,
      microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate);
      lubricants (for example, magnesium stearate, talc or silica);
      disintegrants (for example, potato starch or sodium starch
      glycolate); or wetting agents (for example, sodium lauryl
      sulphate). The tablets can be coated by methods well known in the
      art. Also included are bars and other chewable formulations.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid preparations for oral administration can take the form of,
      for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they can be
      presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other
      suitable vehicle before use. In one embodiment, the liquid
      preparations can be formulated for administration with fruit
      juice, e.g., apple juice. Such liquid preparations can be prepared
      by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives
      such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol syrup, cellulose
      derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (for
      example, lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (for example,
      almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol or fractionated vegetable
      oils); and preservatives (for example, methyl or
      propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). Other suitable
      non-aqueous vehicles may include neuroprotective foods, e.g., fish
      oil, flax seed oil, etc. The preparations can also contain buffer
      salts, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      Preparations for oral administration may be provided as a unit
      dosage form, for example, as tablets, capsules, etc. These can be
      presented in blister packs or in multi-dose containers.
      Preparations for oral administration can also be suitably
      formulated to give controlled release of the active compound.<br>
      <br>
      For buccal or sublingual administration the formulations can take
      the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.
      The formulations can be prepared for parenteral administration by
      injection, for example, by bolus injection or continuous infusion.
      Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form,
      for example, in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an
      added preservative. The formulations can take such forms as
      suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles,
      and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing
      and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredients
      can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle,
      for example, sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
      <br>
      The formulations can also be prepared in rectal compositions such
      as suppositories or retention enemas, for example, containing
      conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other
      glycerides.<br>
      <br>
      The formulations can also be provided as a depot preparation. Such
      long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for
      example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular
      injection. Thus, for example, the formulations can be prepared
      with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as
      an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as
      sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble
      salt.<br>
      <br>
      The formulations can be presented in a pack or dispenser device,
      which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the
      active ingredient. The pack may, for example, comprise metal or
      plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device
      can be accompanied by instructions for administration.<br>
      <br>
      The therapeutic formulations of the invention can also contain a
      carrier or excipient, many of which are known to skilled artisans.
      Excipients that can be used include buffers (for example, citrate
      buffer, phosphate buffer, acetate buffer, and bicarbonate buffer),
      amino acids, urea, alcohols, ascorbic acid, phospholipids,
      proteins (for example, serum albumin), EDTA, sodium chloride,
      liposomes, mannitol, sorbitol, and glycerol.<br>
      <br>
      Methods useful for making formulations are known in the art and
      can be found in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences
      (Gennaro, ed., Williams &amp; Wilkins, Baltimore, Md.).<br>
      <br>
      The invention additionally features methods of treating a
      neurodegenerative disorder in a subject, involving administering a
      therapeutically effective amount of a composition of the invention
      to the subject, such that the disorder is treated. The invention
      further features methods of reducing symptoms associated with a
      neurodegenerative disorder in a subject, involving administering a
      therapeutically effective amount of a composition of the invention
      to the subject, such that the symptoms of the disorder are
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the instant composition may act, for example, by (i)
      eliminating a cognitive disorder, (ii) ameliorating one or more
      symptoms of a cognitive disorder, (iii) slowing the progression of
      a cognitive disorder, (iv) delaying the onset of a cognitive
      disorder's symptoms, and (v) reducing the likelihood of a
      cognitive disorder's onset.<br>
      <br>
      Importantly, the combination of components of the formulations has
      been discovered to be more effective than the individual
      components in the uses of the invention. As the results described
      herein indicate, the degree of efficacy of the particular
      formulations of the invention was completely unanticipated,
      indicating that these unique combinations synergistically provide
      neuroprotection. Although convenient for administration, it is not
      necessary for the agents or components of the nutraceutical
      formulations to be compounded together for administration to a
      subject. Instead, they can be administered concurrently, or in
      close enough succession so that the desired dosage level for all
      components is achieved in the bloodstream at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      In general, a nutraceutical formulation is formulated by combining
      appropriate concentrations of stock agent (e.g., in solution or
      solid) of the components in a medium. The components can be
      administered together, in rapid succession, or at intervals. A
      composition may be tested to determine whether it is an effective
      nutraceutical formulation in an in vitro cell culture system of
      primary, secondary, or immortalized neural cells, for example,
      cells that exhibit the molecular and biochemical characteristics
      of normal neural cells, or cells that exhibit at least some of the
      molecular and biochemical characteristics of a neurologic
      disorder. Such cells and methods of evaluating the effects of the
      formulations are known in the art, and exemplary cells and methods
      are described in the Examples. Biochemical and physical criteria
      can be used to measure the ability of a nutraceutical formulation
      to ameliorate adverse events associated with aging and
      inflammation. Biochemical and physical criteria can additionally
      be used to measure the ability of a nutraceutical formulation to
      ameliorate adverse effects associated with a disorder in these
      cell culture systems.<br>
      <br>
      Animal models are likewise useful for evaluating the efficacy of a
      nutraceutical formulation. Nutraceutical formulations can be
      evaluated in vivo using an animal model, for example, an animal
      model for AD. Examples of animal models for AD are mice expressing
      the human E4 allele of ApoE, mice expressing the human form of the
      protein Tau, and other transgenic mouse lines in which expression
      of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is affected (Reaume et
      al., J. Biol. Chem., 271:23380-23388, 1996; Hsiao et al., Science,
      276:99-102, 1996; and Games et al., Nature, 373:523-527, 1995).
      Nutraceutical formulations can also be evaluated for their
      efficacy in preventing or ameliorating the effects of AD using an
      animal model. The effects of a nutraceutical formulation on
      ameliorating behavioral and biochemical symptoms in such mice are
      evaluated after administering a nutraceutical formulation to these
      mice both early in life and after symptoms begin to develop. Mice
      are evaluated for the development or progression of learning and
      memory disorders as well as for pathophysiologic and biochemical
      abnormalities such as the presence of plaques in cortical and
      limbic structures of the brain. Prevention of the onset or
      progression of symptoms, or the amelioration of existing symptoms,
      indicates that the nutraceutical formulation is effective for
      treating Alzheimer disease in humans.<br>
      <br>
      While is not necessary for all of the components of a
      nutraceutical formulation to be administered in the same
      excipient, in the same form, or delivered at precisely the same
      time during a day, the components should be administered so they
      are present in the treated subject at the same time (e.g., present
      in a cell that is the target of treatment), and thus, one
      formulation, including both components, is generally provided in a
      convenient dosage form.<br>
      <br>
      The nutraceutical formulations of the invention may be components
      in kits. These kits can also include instructions for
      administration of the formulations to a subject, and optionally
      may include one or more other nutraceuticals, e.g., ginko biloba,
      fish oil, apple juice, flax seed oil, and other nutraceutical
      foods or formulations known in the art. These kits may
      additionally include instructions for administration, and/or other
      nutraceutical foods or formulations.<br>

      EXAMPLES<br>
      <br>
      The fish oil enriched omega 3 fatty acid DHA has been reported to
      be ineffective in treating mild to moderate Alzheimer disease
      patients who have extensive beta amyloid plaques and tangles. It
      has been shown that DHA can reduce the accumulation of beta
      amyloid but DHA appears to lose efficacy over time as pathology
      develops in an animal model with both beta amyloid and tangles
      (tau pathology), the 3×AD transgenic mouse. We found that fish oil
      alone was insufficient to treat the 3×AD Tg mouse.<br>
      <br>
      Fisetin, a natural flavonoid enriched in strawberries, is
      neuroprotective and can improve cognitive function in various
      animal models including aging mice and beta amyloid plaque
      accumulating transgenic mice. We have tested 0.6% DHA alone, 500
      ppm fisetin alone and DHA+fisetin in combination delivered as a
      food supplement (in chow) to older 3×AD Tg mice with combined
      amyloid and tau pathology. The study ran from ̃9 months to 13-14
      months of age. Cognitive deficits were improved by DHA+fisetin but
      not by DHA alone or fisetin alone (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 1, Morris Water Maze results show no improvement
      in time (latency) to find a hidden platform with additional blocks
      of training when 12-13 month old 3×AD Tg mice are tested on
      control bad (high safflower oil) diet with or without DHA (green)
      or fisetin (light blue) but marked improvement over time with
      DHA+fisetin together.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2. Shows that the dietary combination of fisetin and DHA
      improved retention in the probe test. In this test the platform is
      removed, and the mice are allowed to swim for 60 seconds, while
      the time in the target quadrant is quantified. Fisetin alone also
      improved retention, but the combination resulted in the best
      performance on this test.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3. Western analysis of proteins from brain of the same 3×AD
      triple mice studied on the same diets as in FIG. 1 behavior
      studies. The excitatory synaptic marker PSD-95 is partially
      protected (increased) by DHA alone (trend) but not by fisetin but
      significantly protected by DHA+fisetin (p&lt;0.001).<br>
      <br>
      These data demonstrate that a treatment combining DHA and fisetin
      or fish oil and fisetin is a synergistic treatment for cognitive
      deficits. Since beta amyloid and tau/tangle pathology occur in
      normal aging and many years prior to Alzheimer diagnosis, DHA and
      fisetin can be effective in slowing cognitive decline with aging
      or Alzheimer's, or an effective treatment for these or other
      conditions with beta amyloid and or tauopathy related cognitive
      deficits including frontal temporal dementia, Pick's, progressive
      supranuclear palsy.<br>
      <br>
      To demonstrate the synergistic activity of the two agents and to
      establish an appropriate fixed-dose ratio for clinical
      investigation, varying amounts of fisetin and DHA have been added
      to N9 microglia cells under simulated inflammatory conditions
      (i.e., 10 μg/ml LPS). After 24 hr NO release was measured in the
      culture medium as NO2 using the Griess assay. Results are
      presented as the % of NO2 in the culture medium of cells treated
      with LPS alone The combination of the two agents was found to have
      a strong synergistic effect on inflammation, particularly at the
      indicated enzyme ratios.<br>
      <br>
      These data show that a combination of DHA and fisetin provide a
      synergistic improvement in anti-inflammatory activity. Effective
      ratios include without limitation those where fisetin is provided
      at a concentration of at least 5 μM, and where the ratio of DHA to
      fisetin may be at least about 1:2, 1:5, 1:10 or more. <br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] There are currently no drugs available that prevent the
      nerve cell death associated with the majority of age-related
      disorders of the CNS. There are a number of reasons for this but
      probably the most important is that multiple factors contribute to
      the nerve cell death such that targeting a single pathway is
      unlikely to be successful. One example of this problem is ischemic
      stroke which is the leading cause of adult disability and the
      third leading cause of death in the US (Véronique, et al.,
      Circulation. (2011) 123 (4), e18-e209). Worldwide, approximately 5
      million people die each year of stroke and the mortality rates are
      estimated to double by the year 2020 (Donnan, et al., The Lancet.
      (2008), 371 (9624), 1612-1623). The nerve cell death associated
      with cerebral ischemia is due to multiple factors resulting from
      the lack of oxygen to support respiration and ATP synthesis,
      acidosis due to the buildup of the glycolytic product lactic acid,
      the loss of neurotrophic support, multiple metabolic stresses and
      inflammation (Lipton, Physiol. Rev. (1999) 79, 1431-1568; and
      Pandya, et al., Cent. Nerv. Syst. Agents. Med. Chem. (2011) April
      27, PMID:21521165). While the focus of current drug discovery
      paradigms is on the development of high affinity, single target
      ligands, it is unlikely that a drug directed against a single
      molecular target will be effective in treating the nerve cell
      death associated with conditions such as stroke because of the
      multitude of insults that contribute to the cell's demise. This
      conclusion is supported by the failure of the single, high
      affinity target approach to drug development to identify
      treatments for stroke. Indeed, the only FDA-approved treatment to
      date is recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA)
      (Green, et al., Drug Discov. Today. (2006) 11, 681-693), which is
      a vascular agent. An alternative approach is to identify small
      molecules that have multiple biological activities relevant to the
      maintenance of neurological function.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The flavonal Fisetin has been found to be an orally active,
      novel neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing molecule (Maher,
      Genes. Nutr. (2009), September 10, PMID:19756810). Fisetin not
      only has direct antioxidant activity but it can also increase the
      intracellular levels of glutathione, the major intracellular
      antioxidant, via the activation of transcription factors such as
      Nrf25. Fisetin can also maintain mitochondrial function in the
      presence of oxidative stress. In addition, it has
      anti-inflammatory activity against immune cells and inhibits the
      activity of 5-lipoxygenase, thereby reducing the production of
      lipid peroxides and their pro-inflammatory by-products (Maher,
      Genes. Nutr. (2009), supra). This wide range of actions suggests
      that Fisetin has the ability to reduce the loss of neurological
      function associated with multiple disorders, including stroke.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Although Fisetin has been shown to be effective in the
      rabbit small clot embolism model of stroke (Maher, et al., Brain
      Research. (2007) 1173, 117-125), its relatively high EC50 in cell
      based assays (2-5 M) and also low lipophilicity (CLogP 1.24), high
      tPSA (107 Å), more hydrogen bond donors (HBD=5) and poor
      bioavailability (Shia, et al., J. Agric. Food Chem. (2009) 57 (1),
      83-89) suggest that there is room for medicinal chemical
      improvement if Fisetin is to be used therapeutically for treating
      neurological disorders such as stroke. However, given its ability
      to activate multiple target pathways related to neuroprotection,
      screening for improvements is significantly more complicated than
      with the current classical approach to the development of a single
      target drug. The present invention is based in part, on the use of
      a multi-tiered approach to screening that has facilitated the
      identification of Fisetin derivatives with significantly enhanced

      <br>
      Described herein are flavonoids (e.g., 5-desoxy flavones and/or
      5-desoxy flavonols, including without limitation fisetin and its
      derivatives) that activate ERK and induce CREB phosphorylation in
      neuronal cultures, facilitate long-term potentiation in
      hippocampal slices and enhance object recognition in vivo. Methods
      of using these flavonoids, for instance, for enhancing memory are
      described.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This disclosure concerns the use of 5-desoxy-flavones and
      5-desoxy-flavonols, such as fisetin and/or its derivatives, to
      enhance memory in vivo and/or to promote nerve cell
      differentiation and/or protect nerve cells from oxidative damage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Memory is the recollection of past experiences. Almost everyone
      forgets something occasionally and, typically, forgetfulness
      increases as a person grows older. Normal aging also may result in
      trouble learning new material or requiring longer time to recall
      learned material. Age-associated memory impairments are currently
      estimated to affect at least 16% of everyone over the age of 50
      (Tully et al., Nature Rev. Drug Discov., 2:267-277, 2003). Mild
      memory loss, while a nuisance, does not usually affect a person's
      normal day-to-day functioning. Other forms of memory loss can be
      more severe and have a functional impact. Common causes of memory
      loss of various severities include, among others, aging,
      Alzheimer's disease, neurodegenerative illness, head trauma or
      injury, seizures, general anesthetics (such as halothane,
      isoflurane, and fentanyl), alcoholism, stroke or transient
      ischemic attack (TIA), transient global amnesia, drugs (such as
      barbiturates or benzodiazepines), electroconvulsive therapy
      (especially if prolonged), temporal lobe brain surgery, brain
      masses (caused by tumors or infection), herpes encephalitis or
      other brain infections, and/or depression.<br>
      <br>
      Long term potentiation (LTP) is considered to be the cellular
      basis of learning and memory and is dependent on synaptic
      plasticity (Bliss and Collingridge, Nature, 361:31-39, 1993),
      which can be defined as the long-lasting strengthening of the
      connections between two nerve cells. Synaptic plasticity in turn
      is believed to be dependent on a complex interplay of protein
      kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors that ultimately
      give rise to long-term changes in the connections between nerve
      cells (Gaiarsa et al., Trends Neurosci. 25:564-570, 2002). Put
      more simply, a particular experience is registered in the brain as
      a circuit-specific pattern of neural activity and, due to synaptic
      plasticity, the structure of the circuit is modified so as to form
      a memory.<br>
      <br>
      LTP was originally discovered in the hippocampus but has since
      been observed in other regions of the brain including the cerebral
      cortex, cerebellum and amygdala (Malenka and Bear, Neuron,
      44:5-21, 2004). One model of learning postulates that the
      hippocampus is the gateway to long-term memory and, once the
      hippocampus has registered a memory, the memory is propagated to
      relevant portions of the cortex for storage (e.g., visual memory
      to visual cortex, auditory memory to auditory cortex, etc.) (for
      reviews, see, Tully et al., Nature Rev. Drug Discov., 2:267-277,
      2003; Adams and Sweatt, Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol.,
      42:135-163, 2002).<br>
      <br>
      Neurotrophic factors, which modulate short- and long-term changes
      in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS), have been
      suggested to play roles in neuronal plasticity such as learning
      and memory (Lo, Neuron, 15:979-981, 1995; Thoenen, Science,
      270:593-598, 1995). Neurotrophic factors support the survival,
      differentiation and functional maintenance of nerve cells. Because
      of these properties, neurotrophic factors have the potential to
      treat a variety of chronic and acute disorders of the CNS,
      including memory loss. However, many classical neurotrophic
      factors, such as nerve growth factor, are not well suited for
      therapeutic purposes due to their large size and proteinaceous
      nature (Levy et al., BioDrugs, 19:97-127, 2005). Thus, the
      identification of small molecules that can mimic some or all of
      the properties of neurotrophic factors could have great potential
      for treating CNS disorders, such as memory deficits.<br>
      <br>
      Twenty eight different flavonoids, including representatives of
      all of the six different flavonoid classes (e.g., flavanones,
      flavan-3-ols, flavonols, flavones, anthocyanidins and isoflavones;
      U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA database for the flavonoid
      content of selected foods, Beltsville, Md.:U.S. Department of
      Agriculture; 2003), were previously assayed for their ability to
      promote neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (Sagara et al., J.
      Neurochem., 90:1144-1155, 2004). Among the flavonoids tested, only
      four were found to promote PC12 cell differentiation and of these,
      fisetin (3,7,3′,4′,-tetrahydroxyflanone; a flavonol) was by far
      the most effective. Fisetin has an EC50 for differentiation of 5
      μM and at 10 μM routinely induces the differentiation of 75-80% of
      the cells The other three flavonoids that induced differentiation
      of PC12 cells, Iuteolin (5,7,3′,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone; a
      flavone), quercetin (3,5,7,3′,4′-pentahydroxyflavone; a flavonol)
      and isorhamnetin (3′-methoxy-3,5,7,4′-tetrahydroxyflavone; a
      flavonol), had EC50s of 10 μM and at best induced the
      differentiation of only 50% of the cells.<br>
      <br>
      The induction of differentiation by fisetin was dependent on the
      activation of the Ras-ERK cascade because inhibitors of this
      cascade blocked differentiation (Sagara et al., J. Neurochem.,
      90:1144-1155, 2004). In addition to promoting nerve cell
      differentiation fisetin has also been shown to protect nerve cells
      from oxidative stress-induced death (Ishige et al., Free Radic.
      Biol. Med., 30:433-446, 2001). However, the structural features of
      fisetin that underlie its functions of promoting nerve cell
      differentiation and/or protecting such cells from oxidative damage
      are unknown. Also unknown is whether the ability of fisetin to
      promote nerve cell differentiation and/or protect neural cells
      from oxidative damage have in vivo correlates.<br>
      <br>
      A need exists for the identification of small molecules that can
      mimic some or all of the properties of neurotrophic factors. Such
      molecules have potential for treating CNS disorders, such as
      memory loss.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      Disclosed herein are fisetin derivatives that are surprisingly
      effective neurotrophic factors. These derivatives (including, for
      example, 3,3′,4′-trihydroxyflavone and 3′,4′-dihydroxyflavone)
      promote nerve cell differentiation and/or protect such cells from
      oxidative damage at significantly lower concentrations than does,
      for example, fisetin.<br>
      <br>
      This disclosure also concerns the discovery that 5-desoxy-flavones
      and/or 5-desoxy-flavonols (such as fisetin and certain of its
      derivatives) improves memory in vivo. This important discovery
      enables, for instance, methods of enhancing memory in wide variety
      of subjects, including normal subjects or subjects suffering from
      memory loss.=<br>

        <div align="left"><b>Health benefits of cucumbers</b><br>
        </div>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Hydration</b><br>
      <br>
      According to Ware, “Cucumbers are 95 percent water." This makes
      cucumbers a great way to stay hydrated, especially during the
      summer. A cup of cucumber slices is “nearly as thirst-quenching as
      a glass of water,” according to Eating Well magazine.<br>
      <br>
      The anti-inflammatory compounds in cucumbers help remove waste
      from the body and reduce skin irritation, according to the
      Cleveland Clinic. Preliminary research also suggests cucumbers
      promote anti-wrinkling and anti-aging activity, according to an
      article in the journal Filoterapia. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Cancer prevention</b><br>
      <br>
      Cucumbers contain two phytonutrient compounds associated with
      anti-cancer benefits: lignans and cucurbitacins. In recent years,
      pharmaceutical companies have been paying special attention to
      cucurbitacins, hoping to use them in new cancer drugs. According
      to a 2010 research review published in Scientific World Journal,
      scientists have found that cucurbitacins can help block the
      signaling pathways that are important for cancer cell
      proliferation and survival. <br>
      <br>
      Cucurbitacins can also inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer
      cells, according to a 2009 study published in the Journal of
      Cancer Research looked at cucurbitacin B (which cucumber contains)
      on human pancreatic cancer cells and found that cucurbitacin
      supplements inhibited the growth of seven pancreatic cancer cell
      lines by 50 percent, and also increased apoptosis, or "death by
      suicide," of pancreatic cancer cells. <br>
      <br>
      According to World’s Healthiest Foods, lignans may protect against
      cancer through working with the bacteria in the digestive tract.
      The bacteria take the lignans and convert them into compounds such
      as enterodiol and enterolactone, which can bind onto estrogen
      receptors and possibly reduce the risk of estrogen-related
      cancers, such as ovarian, breast, endometrial and prostate
      cancers. The research is not yet clear on whether lignans actually
      assert anti-cancer benefits. <br>
      <br>
      A 2009 meta-analysis published in the British Journal of Cancer
      found little or no association between lignan intake and reduced
      breast cancer risk. Similarly, most studies have not found
      significant correlations between lignan intake and reduced
      prostate cancer risk, according to the Linus Pauling Institute at
      Oregon State University, though one study of older Scottish men
      published in the British Journal of Nutrition showed that
      consuming an enterolactone-containing serum reduced the risk of
      prostate cancer. <br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, a Journal of Nutrition study of nearly 800
      American women found that those with those with the highest lignan
      intake had the lowest risk of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a study
      published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked
      at nearly 1,000 women in the San Francisco area and found that
      postmenopausal women with the highest lignan intakes had the
      lowest risk of endometrial cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Skin</b><br>
      <br>
      You’ve probably seen pictures of people at a spa relaxing with
      cucumber slices over their eyes. It turns out there’s science
      behind this pampering ritual. Ware explained, “Cucumbers have a
      cooling and soothing effect that decreases swelling, irritation
      and inflammation when used topically. Cucumber slices can be
      placed on the eyes can decrease morning puffiness or alleviate and
      treat sunburn when placed on the affected areas.” She also noted
      that high vegetable intake is associated with a healthy complexion
      in general. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Bone health</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, in the
      past few decades, it has become clear that vitamin K is important
      to bone health, and one cup of cucumber contains about 19 percent
      of the recommended daily intake of vitamin K. One review published
      in Nutrition noted that vitamin K intake might reduce fracture
      rates, work with vitamin D to increase bone density and positively
      affect calcium balance. <br>
      <br>
      The human body uses vitamin K when building bones, and the effects
      seem to be especially important for women. A large 2003 American
      Journal of Clinical Nutrition study showed that low vitamin K
      levels were associated with low bone density in women, but not in
      men. Another study published in the American Journal of Clinical
      Nutrition in 1999 found that low intakes of vitamin K were
      associated with an increased risk of hip fractures in middle-age
      women. This is especially interesting because the women saw
      results from eating lettuce, showing that dietary consumption of
      vitamin K via eating vegetables (not supplements) is beneficial.
      When it comes to men, the affects of vitamin K and bone health may
      become more apparent as they age: A 2000 study saw reduced risk of
      hip fracture among both elderly women and elderly men who consumed
      more vitamin K.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Antioxidants</b><br>
      <br>
      Cucumbers contain several antioxidants, including vitamin C,
      beta-carotene and manganese, as well as flavonoids, triterpenes
      and lignans that have anti-inflammatory properties. Vitamin C is
      well known for its immune system benefits, and beta-carotene has
      been shown to be beneficial for vision, according to the Mayo
      Clinic. <br>
      <br>
      According to a 2010 animal study published in the Journal of Young
      Pharmacists, fresh extracts from cucumber showed increased
      scavenging of free radicals. Free radicals are associated with a
      variety of human diseases, but can sometimes be held in check by
      antioxidants, according to the Pharmacognosy Review. <br>
      <br>
      Another study of cucumber extracts in animals, published in the
      Archives of Dermatological Research, found increased overall
      antioxidant benefits. Though this study focused on the cosmetic
      applications of this use of cucumbers, decreased free radicals can
      improve your inside organs as well as your skin. <br>
      <br>
      An additional study published in Current Pharmaceutical Design
      found a positive association between the triterpene cucurbitacin
      and reduced inflammation, particularly in cancer cells. A review
      of triterpenes on the immune system, published in the Journal of
      Ethnopharmacology, suggested that they can help with inflammation
      and encouraged future research.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heart health</b><br>
      <br>
      “Eating a variety of fruits and vegetables of all kinds is
      associated with a reduced risk for many health conditions, such as
      heart disease, diabetes, stroke and obesity,” said Ware.
      Cucumbers’ potassium content may be especially helpful in this
      regard. One cup of sliced cukes contains only about 4 percent of
      the body’s daily potassium needs, but it comes with significantly
      fewer calories than most high-potassium foods like bananas.
      Potassium is an essential part of heart health, according to the
      American Heart Association. Many studies have linked it with lower
      blood pressure because it promotes vasodiliation (widening of the
      blood vessels), according to Today’s Dietitian. A study of 12,000
      adults, published in Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that
      those who consumed 4,069 mg of potassium each day lowered their
      risk of cardiovascular disease and ischemic heart disease by 37
      percent and 49 percent, respectively, compared to those who took
      1,793 mg per day. <br>
      <br>
      The vitamin K in cucumbers is also known to be essential in the
      blood-clotting process, according to the Harvard School of Public
      Health. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Risks of eating cucumbers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There can be a few risks from eating cukes. Pesticide consumption
      is one concern. Ware explained, “The Environmental Working Group
      produces a list each year of fruits and vegetables with the
      highest levels of pesticide residue, known as the Dirty Dozen.
      Cucumbers are one of the fruits and vegetables that the
      Environmental Working Group has placed on its Dirty Dozen list,
      meaning the exposure to pesticide residue is high.”<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, cucumbers may be waxed to help protect them during
      shipping. According to World’s Healthiest Foods, both organic and
      conventionally grown cukes may be waxed, but organic ones can only
      use non-synthetic waxes with chemicals approved under organic
      regulations. For this reason and the pesticide concerns, World’s
      Healthiest Foods encourages buying organic cucumbers. But Ware
      stipulated, “This does not mean you should avoid cucumbers
      altogether if you can’t find or afford organic. The nutritional
      benefit of eating conventionally grown produce outweighs the risk
      of not eating produce at all.”...<br>

      <b>2. Discussion of Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      Rhus verniciflua stokes is fallen leaves broad leaf arborescent
      belonging to the Anacardiaceae family and it is known that Rhus
      verniciflua stokes is originally from the Himalayas and highlands
      of Central Asia. It is now distributed widely throughout the
      world, from the subtropics to the temperate regions, with the
      tropics as the center. Rhus verniciflua stokes is fallen leaves or
      evergreen trees and most of them are shrub trees or tall trees,
      but some of them are climbing trees (Barkley Fred Alexander., Ann.
      of the Missouri Bot. Garden., 24(3), pp 265-500, 1937).<br>
      <br>
      A sap of Rhus verniciflua stokes is known as an oriental lacquer.
      In terms of oriental medicine, it is widely known that a dried
      oriental lacquer removes extravasated blood; improves blood
      circulation; and is effective in reducing or alleviating hookworm,
      stomachache, excessive acid in the stomach, thick sputum,
      tuberculosis, period pains, constipation, diabetes, malaria,
      anti-inflammatory, arthritis, and is useful for use as a
      preservative, strengthening the stomach, easing menstruation pain,
      and the like, and it is recently known that it is effective in
      preventing cancer (Namba, T., Colored Illustrations of Wakan Yaku.
      p 215, Hoikusha Publishing Co. Ltd., Osaka, 1980). In addition, in
      terms of common medicine, it is known that it is useful as a
      digestive medicine; it controls extravasated blood in the liver;
      it controls cardiac disease as a drug for cleaning blood in the
      heart; removes tuberculosis germs in the lung; and also it is an
      excellent drug for neuralgia, arthritis, skin diseases, and the
      like because Rhus verniciflua stokes and a wild ginseng are
      comparable to each other in effect.<br>
      <br>
      It is already known from much research that Rhus verniciflua
      stokes include a lot of anti-oxidative substances. Specifically,
      it is known that the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract that is
      extracted by using ethanol has strong anti-oxidative activity and
      also the fraction that is isolated and purified by using a silica
      column has an ability for inhibiting the growth of tumor cells in
      the human blood. In addition, it is also known that a substance
      having an antimicrobial effect is isolated from the Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract that is extracted by using ethanol and
      Rhus verniciflua stokes skin extract that is extracted by using
      methanol has various bioactivity effects related to the Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract, such as an effect on suppressing
      obesity.<br>
      <br>
      Compounds that are found in Rhus verniciflua stokes genus until
      now include fisetin, fustin, agathisflavone, eicosanedioic acid,
      europetein, butein, corilagin, 3′4′-dihydroxy-flavone,
      lantabetulic acid, myricetin, syringin, semialatic acid,
      palasitrin, sulfuretin, 3-pentadecyl-1,2-benzenediol,
      demethoxykanugin, ovalitenone, semimornic acid,
      2-(3,4-dihydroxybenzyl)-2,6-dihydroxy-3(2H)-benzofuranone,
      mesuaferrone A, resokaempferol, rhoifolin, rhusflavanone,
      succedaneaflavanone, fisetin; 7-0-β-D-glucopyranoside, bhilawanol,
      tannin, hydrolaccol, stellacyanin, quercetin, cynarine, and the
      like, and the largest content of the components among them is
      fustin.<br>
      <br>
      The above components are mostly flavonoid-based materials and
      flavonoids, such as fisetin and fustin, which play a role in
      protecting blood vessels or capillaries. And also, the fisetin and
      fustin are very excellent bioactive substances having
      antioxidative activity, anti-inflammatory properties, and
      anticancer properties. However, the fustin that is plentifully
      included in the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract has a disadvantage
      wherein its activity is greatly decreased as compared to the
      activity of fisetin in terms of bioactivity. On the other hand,
      the fisetin has activitystrong anticancer activity so that it is
      now being used as an anticancer drug, but there is a disadvantage
      that a major component of most conventional Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extracts is the fustin and the fisetin is included in small
      quantity as compared to the fustin.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, when the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract containing a
      lot of fisetin with excellent bioactivity may be prepared, the
      Rhus verniciflua stokes extract may have relatively excellent
      anticancer activity and bioactivity so that it can be expected to
      be very useful in the food and medicine industries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Accordingly, the present inventors preformed research into a
      method for preparing a Rhus verniciflua stokes extract having very
      excellent bioactivity by controlling the content of a flavonoid
      compound in the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the present inventors completed the present invention
      by developing a method for preparing new Rhus verniciflua stokes
      extract including a large quantity of fisetin having various
      bioactivities, as well as anti-oxidative activities and anticancer
      activities.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide
      Rhus verniciflua stokes extract with an increased content of an
      active flavonoid compound by converting fustin, a flavonoid
      compound, into fisetin, an active flavonoid compound, in which the
      active flavonoid compound is plentifully included in the Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the above objects, there is provided a method
      for preparing a Rhus verniciflua stokes extract with an increased
      content of an active flavonoid compound, including: extracting
      Rhus verniciflua stokes extract using an extraction solvent; and
      performing a gas bubbling treatment into the Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, the gas may include
      oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      In an embodiment of the present invention, the gas bubbling
      treatment may be performed by using at least one way of
      implementation thereof along with the extraction of Rhus
      verniciflua stokes at the same time, or after completing the
      extraction of Rhus verniciflua stokes. Preferably, the gas
      bubbling treatment may be performed by at least one method of

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides a method for preparing a Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract having an increased content of an
      active flavonoid compound, including extracting Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract using an extraction solvent; and performing a gas
      bubbling treatment into the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract.<br>
      <br>
      Rhus verniciflua stokes is known as a fallen leaves broad leaf
      arborescent belonging to the Anacardiaceae family; it is spread
      throughout subtropical zones and tropical regions; and 60 genus
      and 400 species trees belong to Rhus verniciflua stokes all over
      the world. It is known that one of active flavonoids that are
      included in Rhus verniciflua stokes extract, fisetin
      (2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroxy-4H-chromen-4-one-hydrate,
      3,3′,4′,7′-tetrahydroxyflavone) has an excellent effect in a wide
      variety of fields, as follows: anticancer activities (Haddad A Q
      et. al., Nutr. Cancer, 2010, 62(5), 668-81), anti-dementia
      activities (Zheng L T et. al., Int. Immunopharmacol., 2008, 8(3),
      484-94), memory improvement (Maher P. et. al., PNAS, 2006,
      103(44), 16568-73), an improvement of symptoms of arthritis (Lee J
      D et. al., Int. Immunopharmacol., 2009, 9(3), 268-76),
      anti-inflammatory activities (Geraets L. et. al., Biochem. Biophys
      Res Commun. 2009, 382(3), 598-603), an improvement of blood
      circulation (Park Y H et. al., J. Ocul Pharmacol. Ther., 2004,
      20(3), 189-200), and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In Rhus verniciflua stokes, the content of flavonoid component
      that is known as a medical component is increased with tree age.
      Generally, only when the tree age is over 10 years, the content of
      flavonoid may be included in about 15 to 20% (w/w) among the
      extract based on the extract. 13 to 17% (w/w) among them is fustin
      (2,3-Dihydrofisetin) represented by Chemical Formula 1, 1 to 3%
      (w/w) is fisetin represented by Chemical Formula 2, and then trace
      amounts of sulfuretin, butein, and the like are included.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that fustin that is plentifully included in Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract has antioxidative activity, anticancer
      activity, etc. like fisetin, but useful bioactivity of fustin is
      greatly decreased as compared to that of fisetin. The comparison
      experiment for antioxidative activities between fustin and fisetin
      that was confirmed by the present inventors supports the above
      fact (see Table 1). That is, according to an embodiment of the
      present invention, it has been seen that the antioxidative
      activity of fisetin was excellent by at least 5 times as compared
      with that of fustin as a result of the comparison experiment for
      anti-oxidative activities between fustin and fisetin.<br>
      <br>
      TABLE 1<br>
      Anti-oxidative Activity<br>

      Fustin&nbsp; 33<br>
      Fisetin&nbsp; 8<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, since fustin has relatively low bioactivity effect as
      compared with that of fisetin that is an active flavonoid having
      excellent anticancer and anti-oxidative activities, fustin refers
      to a “non-active flavonoid” for the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the present invention provides a method for preparing a
      Rhus verniciflua stokes extract by converting fustin that is
      plentifully included in Rhus verniciflua stokes extract into
      fisetin that is an active flavonoid with excellent bioactivity,
      and the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract prepared according to the
      present invention includes a large quantity of an active flavonoid
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      The method for preparing the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      according to the present invention includes performing a gas
      bubbling treatment on Rhus verniciflua stokes extract.<br>
      <br>
      The Rhus verniciflua stokes refers to the trees belonging to the
      Anacardiaceae family, and a type of useable Rhus verniciflua
      stokes may include any one or more selected from the group
      consisting of Rhus trichocarpa MIQ, Rhus verniciflua, Rhus
      cotinus, Rhus ambigua H.Lev., Succedanea Sumac, and Rhus
      succedanea L., but the present invention is not limited thereto.
      Preferably, Rhus verniciflua may be used.<br>
      <br>
      A proper solvent for extracting Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      according to the present invention may include water and an
      organic solvent, and preferably may include alone or a combination
      of various solvents, such as water, alcoholic solvent, methanol,
      ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, acetone, ether, benzene,
      chloroform, ethylacetate, methylenechloride, n-hexane,
      hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, formic acid, citric acid,
      cyclohexane, petroleum ether, and the like. More preferably,
      water, an alcoholic solvent, and methanol may be used, and most
      preferably, water may be used.<br>
      <br>
      The Rhus verniciflua stokes extract according to the present
      invention may be prepared by a general method for preparing an
      extract, and specifically, may be prepared by a hot-water
      extraction method, a macerating extraction method, a digesting
      extraction method, and the like, and may be prepared by using a
      general extracting machine, sonicator, or fractionators. In
      addition, the extract is extracted by using a solvent and then
      filtering, concentrating, or drying may be selectively performed
      to remove the solvent from the extract or all of filtering,
      concentrating, and drying may be performed to remove the solvent
      from the extract. Specifically, the filtering may include
      decompression filtering or pressurization filtering using a filter
      for filtering, and the concentrating may include decompression
      concentrating in a vacuum. In addition, water of the resulting
      extract may be completely removed through the concentrating and
      drying, and the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract without water may
      be used in a type of powder or the powder may be solved in
      distilled water or general solvent to use. Accordingly, the Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract including a high content of an active
      flavonoid compound that is obtained by extracting and converting
      the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract according to the present
      invention may be commercialized as an extract powder or extract
      solution through filtering, concentrating, or drying process.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, useable gas in the bubbling treatment may include gas
      containing oxygen, if it does not disrupt the reaction,
      preferably, high purity oxygen, and more preferably, pure oxygen,
      but the present invention is not limited thereto.<br>
      <br>
      A method for preparing the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract with an
      increased content of an active flavonoid compound according to the
      present invention are described in more detail, as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Water, alcoholic solvent, an organic solvent, or diluents solution
      thereof is added as a solvent for extracting Rhus verniciflua
      stokes, and then is heated to extract. In the extracting process,
      gas, preferably the gas containing oxygen is bubbled through the
      extraction solution or concentration solution. The above process
      is performed to convert fustin, a non-active flavonoid compound
      into fisetin, active flavonoid, in which the fustin is plentifully
      included in the extract extracted from Rhus verniciflua stokes.
      The gas bubbling process may be performed with extracting at the
      same time, after extracting for a certain time, or after making
      the concentration solution through the concentrating of the
      extraction solution that is completely extracted.<br>
      <br>
      The bubbling gas may include a gas containing oxygen, preferably,
      air or high purity air, and preferably, pure oxygen. When the
      purity degree of oxygen is high, it has an advantage that even
      though the processing time is short; the same effect can be
      obtained. The purity of oxygen included in the bubbling gas is 20%
      (v/v) in the case of air. According to a method of supplying high
      purity oxygen with at least 95% (v/v) purity, the higher the
      purity of oxygen, the shorter the time required for converting
      fustin into fisetin; and the lower the purity of oxygen, the
      longer the time required thereby requiring a considerable time for
      completely converting.<br>
      <br>
      When the bubbling treatment is performed for a short time, less
      than 1 hour, fustin is only slightly or very slightly converted
      into fisetin so that there is a Lag-time, in which the components
      are not changed for a period of time, such that a proper gas
      bubbling treatment time is required. On the other hand, excessive
      oxygen bubbling causes decomposition after converting fustin into
      fisetin so that it is important that a proper time should be
      selected.<br>
      <br>
      A case of applying the similar method as the method of the present
      invention to remove an allergy inducing material is disclosed in
      Korean Patent No. 10-0918326, but there is no technology for
      converting fustin into fisetin with high activity. The removal of
      an allergy inducing material is performed along with a supply of
      oxygen at the same time and completed within a short time, while
      the conversion of fustin into fisetin is gradually preformed at
      the end of completing the removal of the allergy inducing
      material. Accordingly, the conversion of fustin into fisetin may
      be a new technological idea that is not disclosed or has not been
      invented in the conventional art for a processing condition
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      When the gas for bubbling is air, it is preferable that the air
      bubbling treatment is continuously maintained for 6 to 24 hours,
      and more preferably for 8 to 12 hours in order to prepare Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract with an increased content of an active
      flavonoid compound according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, when the gas for bubbling is high purity oxygen, it
      is preferable that the bubbling treatment is continuously
      maintained for 5 to 12 hours, and more preferably for 7 to 10
      hours in order to prepare Rhus verniciflua stokes extract with an
      increased content of an active flavonoid compound according to the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The amount and time for bubbling oxygen may be generally based on
      volumetric flow rate (l/min) of gas, and preferably, unit
      volumetric flow rate (VVM, l/min/volume) which is the volumetric
      flow rate divided by a volume of solution. The time for supplying
      of air may be 1 to 40 hours depending on a gas supplying flow.
      However, when the time passes 12 hours, most of fustin is
      converted into fisetin, such that further supplying of air is not
      substantially need. Of course, when the supply rate of gas is very
      slow, the time for completely converting into fisetin may require
      at least 20 hours. Accordingly, the conversion rate of fustin into
      fisetin may be possibly controlled by changing a flow rate of gas
      or the time for supplying gas.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the present invention may provide Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract with an increased content of an active flavonoid
      compound due to the gas bubbling treatment, and also provide Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract, in which 45 to 100% of the
      conventional content of fustin presented in Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract may be converted into fisetin. That is, all of
      fustin that is an essential component of the conventional Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract can be substantially converted into
      fisetin through a method of extracting Rhus verniciflua stokes
      according to the present invention so that there may be
      substantially no fustin in the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the present invention may provide Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract having the content ratio of 1:0 to 2:1 of
      fisetin:fustin.<br>
      <br>
      The bubbling condition of gas through Rhus verniciflua stokes
      extract is varied according to the pressure or purity of the used
      gas. That is, in relation to the pressure, the bubbling may be
      continuously performed on the bottom of an extractor through a
      blower, etc. under atmospheric pressure, or may be performed by
      supplying high-pressure gas. It may not be affected by the
      internal pressure of the extractor. That is, even when the
      internal pressure of the extractor or concentrator is maintained
      within a range of 0 to 10 atmospheric pressures, the effect may
      not be changed. The greater the pressure, the greater the
      solubility of oxygen is increased so that the processing time may
      be reduced, but economic feasibility and stability may be
      significantly reduced due to a sharp increase of installation cost
      in order to maintain high pressure.<br>
      <br>
      For a method for preparing a Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      according to the present invention, the gas bubbling may be
      generally disclosed in the case of supplying at the bottom of the
      extractor, but may be performed by using a way of supplying gas
      through an appropriate pipe after installing the appropriate pipe
      inside the extractor. Also, the gas bubbling may be performed by a
      way of separately supplying a gas to allow for contact between the
      extract solution and the bubbling gas outside the extractor. Here,
      it may be a general system of contacting liquid and gas, and the
      system may include a wider area that can allow for contact between
      the gas and extract solution as a separate space or in the upper
      of the extractor. Accordingly, the gas bubbling treatment
      according to the present invention may include a method of
      bubbling gas through the extract solution of Rhus verniciflua
      stokes inside the extractor that is used for extracting, a method
      of contacting the bubbling gas and the extract solution outside
      the extractor, a method of flowing the gas and extract solution in
      the same directions or reverse directions at the same time, or a
      method of using an apparatus, such as an inline mixer, as a
      machine for mixing the gas and extract solution.<br>
      <br>
      The Rhus verniciflua stokes extract prepared by the method of the
      present invention may be reconstituted as a fractional material
      with a high content of fisetin through a further fractionation
      process. That is, when the solution fractionation may be performed
      by using acetone, ethyl acetate, n-butanol, chloroform, and the
      like, as organic solvent, the fractional material that is improved
      by 30 to 45% (w/w) of fisetin content may be prepared from the
      extract with 5 to 25% (w/w) of fisetin content. In addition, the
      purified material with at least 90% (w/w) purity of fisetin may be
      obtained by performing re-crystallization of the same. However,
      when the method for preparing a Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      according to the present invention is not applied, the fisetin
      with high purity may not be easily obtained by fractionation
      and/or re-crystallization due to an interference of fustin even
      though the organic solvent is used. Accordingly, in case of
      performing the fractionation and/or re-crystallization according
      to the inventive conversion method, there is provided an effective
      way of obtaining plentiful amounts of high purity fisetin.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, a method for preparing a Rhus verniciflua stokes
      extract may include adding water, alcoholic solvent, or diluted
      alcoholic solvent to Rhus verniciflua stokes, extracting the same,
      and then concentrating and/or drying the same. In this case, the
      composition of flavonoid in the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      may be composed of 10 to 30% (w/w) of fustin, 1 to 4% (w/w) of
      fisetin, and 0.1 to 2%(w/w) of other flavonoid content. In the
      case of flavonoid, the content is increased with tree age. The
      rate of fustin and fisetin in Rhus verniciflua stokes may be
      usually maintained within a constant range, and the whole content
      is increased with tree age. In this case, the content ratio of
      fisetin:fustin may be from the minimum 1:2.5 to the maximum 1:30,
      and generally 1:5 to 1:15.<br>
      <br>
      Like this, the content ratio of fisetin:fustin may be generally in
      the range of 1:2.5 to 30. However, in the case of Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract according to the inventive method for preparing a
      Rhus verniciflua stokes extract, the content ratio of
      fisetin:fustin may be adjusted low by less than 1:0.2. Generally,
      the difference of activities may be great since the content ratio
      of fisetin:fustin of 1:1, and it may preferably be 5:1, which
      means that the content of fisetin is 5 times the content of fustin
      and also the content of fisetin is significantly increased as
      compared with the conventional Rhus verniciflua stokes extract. In
      this case, the content of polyphenol that is known to have
      bioactivity, such as anti-oxidative activity, immunity-boosting
      properties, and the like is also very highly maintained at 40 to
      70% (w/w).<br>
      <br>
      When fustin is substantially and completely converted into fisetin
      by supplying high purity oxygen, the content ratio of
      fisetin:fustin may be maintained at a level of 1:0.001. It means
      that almost all of fustin is converted into fisetin and the Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract with high content of fisetin obtained
      from the above process may become a Rhus verniciflua stokes
      extract having high bioactivity.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, as compared with the conventional Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract, the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract having an
      increased content of active flavonoid compounds according to the
      present invention may have excellent bioactivities, such as
      anticancer activity, anti-dementia activity, an improvement of
      memory, an improvement of arthritis, anti-inflammatory activity,
      anti-oxidative activity, an improvement of blood circulation, and
      the like.<br>
      <br>
      According to an embodiment of the present invention, as compared
      with the conventional Rhus verniciflua stokes extract, it has been
      seen that the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract prepared through the
      inventive preparation method has very excellent anticancer and
      anti-oxidative activities (see Examples 3 and 4). Especially, with
      reference to the anticancer activity of the Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract according to the present invention, according to an
      embodiment of the present invention, it has been seen as a result
      of comparing the effects on inhibiting growth of cancer cells in
      mice injected with of the conventional Rhus verniciflua stokes
      extract and the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract of the present
      invention that the weight and volume of cancer in the mice
      injected with the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract having a large
      quantity of fisetin according to the present invention are
      significantly decreased as compared with the mice injected with
      the conventional Rhus verniciflua stokes extract (see Table 3).
      The above result supports the reported excellent anticancer
      activity of the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract according to the
      present invention having a large quantity of fisetin that is known
      to have excellent anticancer activity.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, the present invention may provide an anticancer
      composition including the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract with the
      content ratio of fisetin:fustin of 1:0 to 2:1 as an effective
      component, and the composition according to the present invention
      may be used for treating and preventing cancer as a pharmaceutical
      composition. In addition, the anticancer composition according to
      the present invention may include 0.1 wt % to 100 wt % of the Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract based on total weight of the

      <br>
      On the other hand, a method for preparing a Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract having an increased content of an active flavonoid
      compound according to the present invention may convert a
      non-active flavonoid compound having a relatively low bioactivity
      into an active flavonoid compound having excellent bioactivity as
      mentioned above. At this point, the non-active flavonoid compound
      may be fustin and the active flavonoid compound may be fisetin.
      Accordingly, the present invention may provide the method of
      converting fustin into fisetin.<br>
      <br>
      The method of converting fustin into fisetin may include
      performing a gas bubbling treatment on a solution containing
      fustin and the gas bubbling treatment may be performed by bubbling
      gas through an extract solution inside the extractor or contacting
      bubbling gas with the extract solution outside the extractor. The
      solution containing fustin may be an extract extracted from a
      natural material; and it may be a solution or extract containing
      fustin and fisetin at the same time; or it may be a solution or
      extract containing fustin only.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, when the gas for bubbling is air, preferably, the
      bubbling treatment may be continuously maintained for 6 to 24
      hours and more preferably, for 8 to 12 hours in order to prepare
      the solution containing high content of fisetin through the method
      of converting fustin into fisetin according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, when the gas for bubbling is high purity
      oxygen, preferably, the bubbling treatment may be continuously
      maintained for 5 to 12 hours and more preferably, for 7 to 10
      hours in order to prepare the solution containing high content of
      fisetin through the method of converting fustin into fisetin
      according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention may convert the extract or
      solution having a large quantity of fustin into the extract or
      solution having a large quantity of fisetin that is an active
      flavonoid compound with excellent bioactivity.<br>
      <br>
      Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more
      detail with reference to the following Examples.<br>
      <br>
      However, the following Examples are only for illustrating the
      present invention, and the content of the present invention is not
      limited to the following Examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Rhus Verniciflua Stokes Extract Through Gas
        Bubbling</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The contents of fustin and fisetin that are included in Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract were analyzed using HPLC. The standard
      products were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. As conditions of
      analyzing by HPLC, UV of 254 nm was used as a detector and 5%
      mixing solution of acetic acid:methanol:acetonitrile=70:20:10 was
      used for a moving phase. Total of 10 ul was injected at the flow
      rate of 1 ml/min. C18 (250 mm*4.6 mm, YMC Pack) was used as a
      column. An analysis of polyphenol was performed by using tannic
      acid as a standard material with Folin-ciocalteu's phenol reagent.
      An absorbance was measured at 725 nm after developing color, and
      calculated using an external calibration method with a standard
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;1-1&gt; Preparation of Rhus Verniciflua Stokes Extract
        Through Air Bubbling</b><br>
      <br>
      100 l of water was added to 10 kg of Rhus verniciflua stokes and
      then extracted at 95° C. for 6 hours. When a large quantity of
      flavonoid component was included in the extract after 4 hours
      during extraction, air (rate of oxygen: 20% (v/v)) was bubbled at
      the bottom of the extractor at the rate of 1.5 l/min. The time for
      bubbling was totally 12 hours and the components were analyzed by
      collecting a sample every hour.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, the content of fustin was significantly decreased as
      time passes and the content of fisetin was increased (FIG. 1).
      After 11.5 hours, substantially 100% of fustin was converted into
      fisetin. The Rhus verniciflua stokes extract was filtered,
      vacuum-concentrated, and then powderized to obtain 0.56 kg of
      brown dry powder; and the content of fustin in the extract powder
      that is a final product was 0.01% (w/w); the content of fisetin
      was 16.7% (w/w); and the content of polyphenol was 56.4% (w/w).
      That is, the present inventors may obtain the extract, in which
      all of fustin having low activity was converted into fisetin, an
      active flavonoid, through a method for preparing a Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;1-2&gt; Preparation of Rhus Verniciflua Stokes Extract
        Through High Purity Oxygen Bubbling</b><br>
      <br>
      As disclosed in the above Example, &lt;1-1&gt;, 100 l of water was
      added to 10 kg of Rhus verniciflua stokes and then Rhus
      verniciflua stokes was extracted at 95° C. When a large quantity
      of flavonoid component was included in the extract through 4 hours
      of the extraction time, high purity oxygen (purity: 95% (v/v)) was
      bubbled at the bottom of the extractor at the rate of 1.2 l/min
      using an oxygen cylinder. The time for bubbling was totally 12
      hours and the components were analyzed by collecting a sample
      every hour.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, the content of fustin was significantly decreased as
      time passes and the content of fisetin was increased according to
      the decrease of fustin content (FIG. 2). At 8.8 hours of treatment
      time, substantially 100% of fustin was converted into fisetin. The
      rate of converting was rapid and the conversion was completely
      processed as compared with the use of air. In addition, when the
      bubbling time is more than necessary, the content of fisetin
      prepared by converting fustin was slightly reduced so that it can
      be known that the proper treating time may be important. The
      extract was filtered, vacuum-concentrated, and then powderized to
      obtain 0.55 kg of brown dry powder. The content of fustin in the
      extract powder that is a final product was 0.00% (w/w); the
      content of fisetin was 12.9% (w/w); and the content of polyphenol
      was 58.2%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Comparative Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of General Rhus Verniciflua Stokes Extract</b><br>
      <br>
      100 l of water was added to 10 kg of Rhus verniciflua stokes and
      then extracted while it was heated at 95° C. for 6 hours. The
      resulting extract was filtered, vacuum-concentrated, and then
      powderized to obtain 0.57 kg of brown dry powder. The content of
      fustin in the extract powder that is a final product was 17.3%
      (w/w); and the content of fisetin was 1.63% (w/w). The content
      ratio of fisetin:fustin that were included in Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract through a method for preparing the conventional
      Rhus verniciflua stokes extract was 1:10.6 and the content of
      polyphenol was 53.1%. That is, in the case of Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract through a common method of extracting without a
      bubbling treatment, the content of fustin was at least 10 times
      higher than that of the content of fisetin.<br>

      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Rhus Verniciflua Stokes Extract Using
        Various Solvents</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Rhus verniciflua stokes extracts according to the present
      invention were prepared by using various extraction solvents. To
      achieve this, purified water, 50% alcoholic solvent, 80% alcoholic
      solvent, 80% methanol, and 100% alcoholic solvent were used as an
      extraction solvent. The conversion rate of fustin into fisetin
      according to hours during extraction process using each of
      extraction solvents was investigated and then the times for
      converting 90% were compared each other. The Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extracts were extracted at 95° C. by adding the extraction
      solvents that were 10 times to 10 kg of Rhus verniciflua stokes as
      disclosed in the above Example. And then the conversion rate into
      fisetin was investigated by sampling the extract every hour while
      bubbling high purity oxygen at the bottom of an extractor in 0.3
      VVM (volume/volume/min). The results are shown in the following
      Table 2.<br>

      As shown in the above Table 2, it has been seen that for the
      extract prepared by using the method for preparing the Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract according to the present invention, the
      fustin in the extract can be converted into fisetin by performing
      a gas bubbling treatment regardless of a type of used solvents.
      However, when the content of water in the solvent was decreased,
      the processing time was increased. Accordingly, from the above
      result, the present inventors can confirm that the processing time
      should be controlled in order to increase the conversion rate into
      fisetin according to a type of solvent in the extraction
      conditions.<br>

      </b><br>
      In order to analyze anticancer activity of the Rhus verniciflua
      stokes extract according to the present invention, firstly the
      anticancer activities of Rhus verniciflua stokes extract prepared
      by the general method of extracting Rhus verniciflua stokes in the
      above Comparative Example 1, the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      according to the present invention prepared from Example
      &lt;1-1&gt;, and Sample, “A” of Example 6 were mutually compared.<br>
      <br>
      The analysis of anticancer activity were performed by using a
      comparison of effect on inhibiting a growth of cancer cell after
      orally administrating the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract
      according to the present invention using a mouse. 5×10&lt;5
      &gt;cells of human non-small cell lung cancer cell line, A549,
      were subcutaneously injected to a nude mouse (Immunodeficient mice
      (male), CanN. Cg-Foxn1nu/CrljBgi). 7 nude mice were assigned for
      one group after dividing a control group, the group of Comparative
      Example 1 and the group of Example &lt;1-1&gt;. The extract was
      not administrated to the control group, the conventional Rhus
      verniciflua stokes extract extracted from Comparative Example 1
      was administrated to the group of Comparative Example 1, and the
      Rhus verniciflua stokes extract according to the present invention
      extracted in Example &lt;1-1&gt; was administrated to the group of
      Example &lt;1-1&gt;. 300 mg/kg volume was orally administrated for
      24 days. A tumor volume was calculated by using the following
      formula (A=Long length, B=Short length) after measuring the long
      length and short length of the tumor using Caliper two times per
      one week during an administration period; then at 27 days, the
      tumor was removed and then its weight was measured.<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      As a result, as shown in Table 3, it has been seen that the tumor
      weight and volume in the mouse of Example &lt;1-1&gt; group were
      significantly small as compared with the animal model group
      administrated with the conventional extract. From this, it has
      been seen that the Rhus verniciflua stokes extract according to
      the present invention has an excellent effect on inhibiting the
      growth of tumor.<br>

      <br>
      A measurement of anti-oxidative activity was performed by using a
      method of measuring an electron-donating ability with DPPH method.
      DPPH is an abbreviation for 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, and is
      widely used a marker for measuring anti-oxidative activity due to
      its radical. The testing processes were as follows: (1) 2 ml of
      0.1 mM DPPH (Sigma, D-9132) dissolved in ethanol was treated to 2
      ml of sample dissolved in ethanol; (2) it was mixed for 10
      minutes, and then maintained at a dark place for 30 minutes; (3)
      an absorbance was measured at 520 nm; and (4) the degree of
      anti-oxidative ability (electron-donating ability, EDA) was
      calculated. Vitamin E (Fluka, 95420) was used as a positive
      control group and Formula was as follow.<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>

      the reference suggests only the content of the sumac and poison
      ivy extract is simple itjineun mentions the difference between the
      raw material composition. Sumac anacardiaceae deciduous hardwood
      neck sap belonging to the (Anacardiaceae) is being used for
      industrial and medicinal and as poison ivy or geonchil, especially
      being used in herbal and private as medicine, etc. judok, fever,
      anthelmintic, malaria, stomach pain, tonggyeong, constipation, as
      otdal It has been used as a food (gimtaejeong (1996) plant
      resources of South Korea II, 294, Seoul National University
      Press). Research on the physiological activity on the sumac
      extract for antioxidant activity was reported in the antimicrobial
      component urushiol, a flavonoid components and fluids (Journal of
      the Korea Food. 31: 855-63; Journal of Pharmacognosy 31: 345-50,
      and reported a), the cytotoxic effects on cancer cells of the
      urushiol component Arch. Pharm. Res. 22: 638-41 reported in
      (2000). Sumac, so results from the allergy example, even though a
      variety of bioactive been restrictions on their use. Many of the
      components that cause the allergic to urushiol lacquer has been
      identified by studying a variety of methods for removing them.
      Among them there is a method for the heat treatment, extraction
      with a solvent, and method for low-temperature value, method of
      treatment using oxygen and the like. It has an analgesic effect in
      natural products derived extracts, but a number have been
      reported, most of which were filled not characterized is limited
      to those only be perceived as a mere extract composition, but much
      research Angelica derived dikeo when playing with materials
      reported were reported during that , composition of the extract
      derived from sumac and Examples, but the analgesic effect of the
      proposed sumac extract extracted using an organic solvent, in
      Korea Patent Publication 10-2005-0047339, using the xylem of the
      lacquer as a raw material in its manufacturing method, as the
      organic solvent acetone , ethanol, and the present invention in
      that it uses, such as methanol, and presents a process for
      producing by using the column chromatography sees that there is a
      sharp difference in the production method and composition.<br>
      <br>
      In Korea Patent No. 0.51953 million call, but to remove the
      allergens in the state added with oxygen, and presents a method
      for extracting and processing the alumina, which is contained in
      the If is the urushiol is polymerized allergens to polymers are
      insoluble in water extract it is assumed that it is not. The
      research and patents related to how far the poison ivy to remove
      the urushiol components of the anti-cancer activity and allergies
      that cause allergies, it was mostly about the physiological
      activity of the extract. The present invention relates to a
      composition having an analgesic effect and anti-cancer effects
      using the extract of the medicinal herbs derived from sumac in its
      effectiveness and the composition has a remarkable difference with
      the previous invention or report. Most with lacquer of patents
      extract the lacquer use of the extract with a solvent including
      water, and purified by the method of the columns and the like, as
      its main component urushiol, Fu Destin, blood paroxetine, seolpu
      Bulletin, part octane, suggests that containing the cafe, such as
      acid, gallic acid. This extract has a composition that is
      non-toxic lacquer derived from medicinal plants screen three kinds
      of allergens in an extract extracted by the raw material, and
      containing 3,4-didroxybenzoic acid and analgesic effect and
      anti-cancer effect of the present invention is characterized in
      that in that to have a manufacturing method is different from the
      composition and utility completely.<br>
      <br>
      Sumac yeoteuna is a major purpose of mainly grown or come within a
      scratch on the skin in a state of wildlife in purpose or funeral
      culture to get chilaek of wood to get the chilaek, while licensed
      recently otdal research on the development of its purpose It has
      been in progress. Sumac is true that the extract and chilaek, is
      sensitive to a twig, so even just to reach the leaves cause side
      effects poison flowing decisive year for use as food or
      pharmaceutical drugs in general extract. In addition, maximizing
      the anti-cancer efficacy is based on the antioxidant effect by the
      unique composition of the already extract of the known
      functionality and the development of a production process
      development and the composition of the new lacquer derived extract
      was necessary in order to provide a composition having an
      analgesic effect, for which in the raw material were to maximize
      efficacy by mixing chilpi, chilmok, geonchil a suitable ratio, in
      the allergen was to use a process for treatment by the method of
      the alkaline water to neutralize the allergens. The extract does
      not induce a major aspect of allergies of the invention produced
      was fully solved by the alkaline treatment step, in the delivery
      of functional compositions adjusting the composition of raw
      materials as appropriate, and unique having a composition by
      developing the extraction process cancer, pain, developed a
      composition having cancer preventive effects. The compositions of
      the present invention may help to solve the cancer, health
      problems caused by the pain, the most even badly flowing chilaek
      poison come extract as compared to using only the xylem of the
      lacquer in order to avoid the flowing problems come a poison in
      conventional invention to uses in the production of it was able to
      provide superior function composition. Analgesic for functionality
      proposed in the present invention show a very superior
      functionality compared to the known so far, which extract may be
      further developed as new drugs or the like.<br>
      <br>
      Sumac chilaek for producing lacquer, and its bark is used as a
      medicinal herb called by chilpi. Chilaek is also used as a herbal
      medicine by the name of geonchil dried. According to the xylem of
      Rhus remove the chilpi Donguibogam, light trapping, etc. hanuiseo
      paper feeding is known to be used for symptoms of edema, ongjeo or
      excuse, such as by saying chilmok. Chilmok is used less extremely
      in the extract content that corresponds to the xylem of Rhus, Fu
      Destin, avoid paroxetine and which contains the same flavonoids
      components allergen otdal content of the ingredients, urushiol is
      to remove what poison rising ingredient extremely down, etc. It
      is. If you remove the bark of the lacquer can be removed in most
      cases the poison rising temper. However, that is chilpi chilaek
      (geonchil) corresponding to the shell portion of the lacquer has
      to produce chilaek mothajiman michichi, it contains a number of
      urushiol poison can easily climb. Chilpi are contained resin
      component and a small amount of a flavonoid ingredients. Geonchil
      has been obtained from the lacquer to dry chilaek, chilaek has
      contained a large amount of ingredients, allergens and urushiol
      should exercise careful even in those taking. Geonchil also has a
      large number of polyphenols contained a large amount, and can
      contain a large amount also as a polymer resin of urushiol. The
      present invention is configured as follows. First, the raw
      material preparation step in the present invention to use the raw
      material is a composition to have most existing patents in the
      described lacquer or a lacquer of xylem Unlike chilmok, chilpi,
      geonchil three kinds of medicinal plants a dry weight ratio of 1:
      0.05 to 0.3: 0.05 to 0.2 consists in mixing ratio of. Geonchil
      will be used instead of the geonchil chilaek the chilaek be dried
      and so that the water content of chilaek 30 ~ 70% (w / w) is
      approximately the case with the addition of excess amount in view
      of this. The second and extracted with added 5 ~ 20 liters of
      water with respect to the raw material the entire 1Kg as an
      extraction solvent for making these extracts mixing the raw
      material and granulation to dry powder, and, the temperature range
      to 50 ~ 110 ° C for 2 to 24 sigan and filtered to obtain a water
      extract, it was added 5 ~ 10 liters of ethanol 95% (v / v) with
      respect to the first raw material 1Kg the remaining extract foil,
      followed by extraction for 2 to 10 hours at 60 ~ 80 ° C obtaining
      the ethanol extract, , it is the step that allows mixing with the
      water extract, and removing the insoluble components by
      microfiltration with a filter of one micron, and was concentrated
      and the resulting liquid is the concentration of the solid content
      of 20 ~ 50% (w / v), fourth, here was added to an alkaline water
      of pH 8.0 ~ 9.5 the concentration of the solid content of 5 ~ 40%
      (w / v) is such that, air, pure oxygen or while adding 1 to 100
      times per hour that the gas mixture in a volume ratio at 25 ~ 110
      ° C 0.5 to 10 by treatment with mixing for a time by polymerizing
      the urushiol to cause allergic remove allergens characteristics,
      and is concentrated and dried to obtain a lacquer composed of the
      extract obtained in powder form.<br>
      <br>
      The extract produced by the method of the present invention is
      based on the solid content of the composition of the component Fu
      Destin 5 ~ 20% (w / w), blood paroxetine 1 ~ 10% (w / w),
      3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid 0.1 ~ 10% (w / w), indicated as an
      effective component in the other sumac extract the far portion as
      a composition characterized in that the polyphenol content of 15 ~
      55% (w / v) in heptane (butein), butyne ( butin) is does not
      contain the composition, and strong analgesic effect, anti-cancer
      effects, to have antioxidant properties and cancer preventive
      effect by their characteristics. Hereinafter, a configuration of
      the invention in detail, the first stage stage of the raw material
      composition is different from what's described in the existing
      most of the patents in the raw material is used the composition.
      The present invention is a chilmok, chilpi, medicinal plants of
      the species geonchil 3 weight ratio of dry materials in the 1: and
      in that characterized in that the mixing ratio of 0.05 to 0.2:
      0.05 to 0.3. Chilmok is high in flavonoid components as saying
      xylem of Rhus content, chilpi is high, such as small amounts of
      flavonoids ingredients and polyphenols, resins to say the outer
      bark of the sumac content, geonchil will pay a wound on the
      surface of the lacquer here dried sap that flows out of chilaek
      and contains a large amount of the resin component of the allergen
      urushiol poison oak and poison ivy to climb. Therefore geonchil
      may be very likely to cause allergies when taking the extract, if
      not completely removes allergens factors. Chilpi geonchil and is
      used as a medicinal herb eohyeol, abdominal pain, Jinhae,
      anthelmintic, etc. it can be used as a treatment to prevent poison
      ivy climbing a relationship that contains urushiol. In the
      configuration of the raw material drying chilpi based on the dry
      weight 1 of chilmok 0.05 to 0.3, is used as geonchil 0.05 to 0.2,
      and decreases the content of the flavonoid components of the
      extract The chilpi and high content of geonchil ratio of the
      composition to maximize the pharmacological ingredient , the
      content of urushiol in the extraction process that results in
      allergy can take a long time to completely remove high. Thus
      completely remove urushiol, and will determine the ratio of raw
      material to extract the pharmacological component having a
      configuration of the extract of the present invention as
      appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      However, when the manufacturing method of the present invention
      may be used prior geonchil chilaek of drying as the case it is. In
      this case, because the water content of the normal chilaek 30 ~
      70% (w / w) in view of this need to increase the amount. Raw
      material is dried and then pulverized in the xylem and chilmok
      chilpi, in each geonchil below 60 ° C to prepare the dinner table
      with a saw and the size of 2mm or less, mixed in proportion. There
      is a less than 60 ° C in the drying is because the activity of the
      physiologically active substances of various enzymes contained in
      the raw material disappeared when dry of at least 60 ° C higher
      temperature. When used instead of the geonchil chilaek it can be
      prepared by the method of drying by grinding a chilpi, chilmok and
      mixed them. The second stage of the water extraction step by
      addition of water as extracting the aqueous extract 5-20 of the
      powdered raw material in the raw material composition by milling
      the total weight multiple step, and a step of obtaining the
      extract. The particle size of the raw material has been able to
      maximize the extraction yield in the case of less varies depending
      on the system that does not support the composition of the crushed
      2mm extract depending on the size of the particles. Water is added
      to 5-20 gives a multiple of the weight of raw materials, five
      submerged enough to prevent a large volume of material related to
      the case when multiples are less than a multiple of 20 is to be
      put to the economical degradation of excess solvent. Heating the
      extract to the extraction for 2 to 24 hours at a temperature 60 ~
      110 ° C to obtain a water extract. Reason why the temperature to
      60 ~ 110 ° C can be increased, so as to effect the extraction for
      improving the extraction effect of various pharmacological
      components including flavonoids solubility in water to extract the
      lower component at a high temperature. The extraction time was 24
      hours or more to extract from 2 to 24 hours is no more than one
      extraction yield, they are extracted with less than 2 hours which
      results in significantly reduced yield of the extraction. The
      third step is to get the water extract as an ethanol extraction
      step, 95% of the remaining extract foil (v / v) was added and the
      first 5 to 10 multiple of the weight of the raw material of
      ethanol, followed by extraction for 2 to 10 hours at 60 ~ 80 ° C
      the ethanol extract is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Ethanol extraction process can allow the primary water because the
      water extraction step is thereby swell the wood car 2 By applying
      the ethanol extraction process increases the extraction yield to
      ethanol is far easily penetrate the inside of the raw material. On
      the other hand, in the case of ethanol as the extraction solvent
      of a hydrophilic material such as wood when used alone on the dry
      raw material it is hydrophobic it results in the extraction of
      components in the deep part of the xylem which is delayed or
      significantly reduced. Therefore, in the present invention
      preferentially extract to obtain a water extract as water, in
      which the swollen material, and then adding ethanol to here found
      a way to achieve even finer component extracted in the interior
      material. As the water after extraction remaining extraction foil
      already has a water content because it is more than 50% To the
      mixture was added more than 95% (v / v) ethanol give dilute the
      concentration of ethanol as appropriate can improve the extraction
      yield, also the extraction of hydrophobic substance It would
      increase. Extraction conditions was defined conditions to maximize
      the extraction yield from 2 to 10 hours at 60 ~ 80 ° C, the
      extraction yield is to be lowered when a lower temperature, or to
      the extraction time within 2 hours. When the extraction
      temperature is excessively high temperatures over 80 ° C because
      the boiling point of 78 ° C using ethanol leads to increased risk
      of sudden excessive pressure rise. Mixing the ethanol extract of
      water extraction liquid and is removed the insolubles by
      microfiltration with a filter of one micron, and consists of by
      concentration of the resultant extract under vacuum to have a
      20-50% concentration of a solid content (w / v). The obtained
      concentrate has chilpi, chilmok, geonchil the allergen urushiol
      that is contained in (or chilaek) but some are naturally removed
      from the extraction procedure, most of which is possible is
      because the residue contained in a large amount. This perfectly
      solved by the following process. <br>
      <br>
      Generally yieoteuna main way to eliminate the introduction of most
      of the allergenic removal step in the extraction process, the
      existing patents so far, in the present invention, only After
      concentrating the extract by polymerizing allergen removing its
      characteristics, the polymer is removed in terms of causes as
      contained in the extract it does not have a significant difference
      between the invention and the other.<br>
      This enables in that it allows access to the pharmacological
      effects of the polymer at the same time able to explain the
      superior pharmacological effects of the extract of the present
      invention. Fourth step is added to an alkaline water of pH 8.0 ~
      9.5 in extract solution concentrate as alkaline treatment step the
      concentration of the solid content and so that the 5 ~ 40% (w /
      v), was added 1 to 100 times per hour for air or pure oxygen in a
      volume ratio of extraction liquid while, by polymerizing
      polymerization the substance urushiol that to stir while treatment
      for 0.5 ~ 10 hours at 25 ~ 110 ° C causing the allergy and the
      content of urushiol in the concentrate to zero, the urushiol the
      polymerization the polymer is to remain in the concentrate It is
      present in polyphenols. Alkaline water used in the dilution of the
      concentrated solution is to use sodium hydroxide, calcium
      hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, etc. As an
      electrolytic water or alkaline agent manufactured by using the
      manufacturing method is electrolyzed as between pH 8.0 ~ 9.5 and
      the well is the alkaline using caustic soda. The reason for using
      the alkaline water here is how to increase the physiological
      activity of the resulting extract is presented the antioxidant,
      anti-cancer force, labor force and increased in this process. The
      reason is that many ingredients that stand out the acid, including
      the urushiol Among the components of flavonoids contained as a
      main component in the extract are the various components extracted
      from most of the other hand, that have a characteristic that is
      soluble in alkali, the extraction process of the present invention
      This is because the neutralization and can enhance the
      availability of these components. Urushiol is also polymerized but
      lost the characteristics already allergens as such, when the
      residual is to be consumed, so the final composition containing
      the concentrate can be obtained an increased effect of the
      increase in antioxidant, anti-cancer force. The reason is that it
      is urushiol and a phenolic structure of the urushiol in the base
      polymer is that it can be regarded as the polyphenols. In Korea
      Patent No. 0.51953 million call, but to remove the allergens in
      the state added with oxygen, and presents a method for extracting
      by treatment with alumina, which is contained in the If is the
      urushiol is polymerized allergens to polymers are insoluble in
      water extract it is assumed that it is not.<br>
      <br>
      This is the portion apart from the present invention. Korea Patent
      No. 0.51953 million when the actual results showed a difference in
      favor and 7% difference between surveyed the content of phenolic
      components Polje. The extract of the present invention showed
      better results in the polyphenol content. Concentrate processing
      is complete allows concentrated and dried to remove the solvent
      consisting of a bar By obtaining a sumac extract obtained in
      powder form, to obtain a homogenized extract powder after dried.
      Extracts obtained by the present invention in the sustain Fu 5 ~
      26% (w / w) the composition as a flavonoid, quercetin blood is 1 ~
      10% (w / w), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid 0.1 ~ 10% (w / w), 15 to
      55% of the polyphenol content (anti-cancer efficacy and potency to
      inhibit pain, characterized in that w / v) which, provides a
      composition having an antioxidant effect, preventing cancer
      efficacy. Fu Destin, Phi Phi as one kinds of flavonoids quercetin
      is quercetin has been reported from a number of plants, but, Fu
      Destin is a lacquer containing large amounts specifically.
      Polyphenols can not be defined for the single-component, as shown
      in its ingredient with a substance that has been reported recently
      such as immunity enhancement effect, that is characterized
      according to the type of plant, having a wide variety of molecular
      structures depending on the site. Therefore, a tannin as the
      polyphenolic Assay was quantified according to the Republic of
      Korea Food process as that in the method the present invention as
      a standard substance. 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid is known to have
      anti-cancer activity as a kind of phenolic acids, anti-thrombotic
      action, and found that this has been reported in a number of
      plants. As causing a variation upon overdose gene it is also
      known. Therefore, the extract has been limited to the range of the
      content of the present invention 0.1 ~ 10% (w / w). Urushiol is
      known as a substance that causes the allergy has become toxic
