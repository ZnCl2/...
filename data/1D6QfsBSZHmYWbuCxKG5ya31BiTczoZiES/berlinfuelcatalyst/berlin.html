      Advanced Power Systems International, Inc. (APSI) is a 20 year old
      company which was formed to develop, manufacture and market the
      Fitch Fuel Catalyst technology. The Fitch Fuel Catalyst is a true
      catalyst which reformulates gasoline, diesel, fuel oil and propane
      allowing the user to extract more energy from these fuels. By
      doing so the user can either increase performance, in terms of
      horsepower and torque, or increase fuel efficiency by using less
      fuel to do the same amount of work. It can also produce a
      combination of both depending on the application.<br>
      <br>
      Because the Fitch Fuel Catalyst causes more complete and efficient
      combustion there is less residue left after combustion something
      which you know of as “emissions”.&nbsp; Thus Green House gases and
      pollution are reduced significantly. <br>
      <br>
      The Fitch Fuel Catalyst reformulates gasoline, diesel, fuel oil,
      propane and natural gas causing the reformulated fuels to produce
      more energy during combustion than these fuels otherwise would. It
      is a true catalyst which by definition causes one or more chemical
      reactions but does not participate in them. Because it doesn't
      participate in the reaction, unlike additives, it is not consumed
      in the reaction and thus lasts for years after initial
      installation. The Fitch Fuel Catalyst also has no moving parts and
      is thus maintenance free.<br>
      <br>
      Because the Fitch Fuel Catalyst causes more complete combustion it
      also reduces pollution and toxic emissions in the form of
      greenhouse gases, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, particulates and
      soot. When combustion is complete and 100% of the potential energy
      is extracted from the fuel the byproducts of combustion are carbon
      dioxide (CO2), water (H2O) and nitrogen (N). Toxic emissions such
      as greenhouse gases are a byproduct of incomplete combustion.
      Because the Fitch Fuel Catalyst causes more complete combustion
      these toxic emissions are reduced substantially.&nbsp; Maintenance
      costs and unscheduled downtime are also significantly reduced
      because of reduced carbon build up.<br>
      <br>
      Using Dart Mass spectrometry Dr. Steven Suib and members of the
      Suib Research Group at the University of Connecticut were able to
      identify four positive molecular changes&nbsp; the Fitch Fuel
      Catalyst induced in treated fuels. This research was, in part,
      funded by a grant from the United States Department of Energy.
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The Fitch technology has been validated numerous times including
      by a University Laboratory, a number of independent engineering
      test facilities using ASTM test protocols, a number of independent
      performance testing facilities, a number of publications and by
      our customers. ..<br>

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates in general to methods and
      devices for treating fuels prior to combustion in order to
      increase combustion efficiency and thereby reduce exhaust
      emissions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] It has long been an objective of many individuals within
      different industries to develop devices and methods for improving
      the combustion efficiency of hydrocarbon fuel burning systems. A
      major breakthrough in improving fuel efficiency was the
      development of a fuel catalyst described in<b> U.S. Pat. No.
        5,580,359</b> that could be used to treat fuel prior to
      combustion. While the fuel catalyst has proven to be effective,
      the underlying mechanism of operation has not been previously
      understood. It is therefore an object of the present invention to
      determine the underlying mechanism of operation of the fuel
      catalyst so that additional catalysts can be analytically
      developed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] The invention is based on the discovery of what is believed
      to be the underlying mechanism that causes a fuel catalyst to
      improve combustion efficiency due to the liberation of hydrogen
      from fuel. Based on the discovery of the underlying mechanism, it
      is possible to analytically determine formulations of new fuel
      catalyst elements. In a preferred embodiment, a fuel catalyst for
      improving combustion efficiency is provided that includes at least
      one hydride producing element, and at least one element of greater
      activity on the electrolytic scale than the hydride producing
      element and at least one element of lesser activity on the
      electrolytic scale than the hydride producing element. The hydride
      producing element preferably includes an element from at least one
      of a Group IV and Group V of the periodic table. The element of
      greater activity and the element of lesser activity preferably
      includes at least one of zinc, magnesium, aluminum, palladium,
      silver, copper and cerium. Preferred formulations of the catalyst
      element include: a) 20-60 %wt antimony, 10-30 %wt tin, 10-80 %wt
      zinc and 1-5 %wt silver; b) 40 %wt antimony, 18 %wt tin, 40 %wt
      zinc and 2 %wt silver; c) 20-60 %wt antimony, 10-30 %wt tin, 20-80
      %wt magnesium, 1-8 %wt cerium and 0.1-1.0 %wt palladium; d) 40 %wt
      antimony, 25 %wt tin, 30 %wt magnesium, 4.8 %wt cerium and 0.2 %wt
      palladium; and e) 25 %wt antimony, 25 %wt tin, 39 %wt zinc and 11
      %wt aluminum. Various mechanisms may be used to bring fuel into
      contact with the fuel catalyst element including in-line housings,
      drop-in housings, coated fuel lines and placing the fuel catalyst
      within fuel tanks among others.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0028] The fuel catalyst described in <b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,359</b>
      functions well in a variety of fuels to increase combustion
      efficiency, reduce exhaust gas pollutants and particulates, and
      increase power. The fuel catalyst can be easily incorporated into
      a fuel treatment device that treats fuel as it is supplied to an
      engine, furnace or boiler. FIG. 1, for example, illustrates a fuel
      treatment device comprising a cylindrical two-part in-line housing
      or container 10 including a fuel flow inlet 12 and a fuel flow
      outlet 14. The container 10 can be manufactured from a plastic
      material, metal, composites and other synthetic materials. In the
      embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, a plurality of catalyst elements
      16 are located within the container 10 and are arranged in two
      sets of three elements as illustrated in FIG. 2. The catalyst
      elements 16 are located between element spacers 18 and mild steel
      mesh disks 20. The element spacers 18 are preferably plastic disks
      with perforations that permit, as with the steel mesh disks 20,
      the passage of fuel from the fuel flow inlet 12 to the fuel flow
      outlet 14, during which time the fuel comes into contact with the
      elements 16. If the container 10 is made from mild steel, it is
      not necessary to include separate mild steel mesh disks 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,359, the elements 16
      preferably include, apart from impurities, <b>60 to 80 %wt tin,
        15 to 30 %wt antimony, 2 to 7 %wt lead, and 3 to 12 %wt mercury,</b>
      and may be formed by casting, extruding, cutting or shaping to
      have any desired configuration. In the illustrated embodiment, the
      elements 16 have a base diameter of approximately 20 mm. Although
      six elements are illustrated, the particular number required
      naturally depends upon the desired application and implementation
      of the fuel treatment device. Further, altering the number of
      elements 16 will naturally change the number of element spacers 18
      and steel mesh disks 20 employed in the device. A catalytic
      reaction takes place between the fuel and the elements 16 as the
      fuel passes through the container 10, which causes an improvement
      in the combustion of the fuel when burned.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In a further embodiment, the elements 16 are composed of a
      composition of 70 to 75 %wt tin, 15 to 25%wt antimony, 2 to 4 %wt
      lead and 3 to 7 %wt mercury and are manufactured by the following
      method:<br>
      <br>
      [0031] a) tin, antimony and lead are melted together in a mild
      steel pot to approximately 50 degrees Celsius above the melting
      temperature and the resultant material is stirred for three to
      four minutes using a mild steel rod or bar;<br>
      <br>
      [0032] b) mercury is added and the temperature is increased a
      further 50 to 100 degrees Celsius, with the resultant material
      being stirred for a further two minutes;<br>
      <br>
      [0033] c) the molten material is poured, by use of a mild or
      stainless steel ladle, into molds (of the desired element shape)
      in a mold block, which is formed of mild steel and is pre-heated
      to a temperature sufficient to prevent the material from
      solidifying in less than one second after pouring.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] It should be noted that mis-cast elements, or any of the
      formulation allowed to solidify in the melting pot, may be
      remelted and re-cast provided that the total time lapse after the
      addition of the mercury does not exceed 45 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In a still further embodiment, the elements 16 may be made
      from an alloy that is approximately 75 %wt tin, 21 %wt antimony
      and 4 %wt lead, wherein 0.5 kg of mercury and 0.020 kg platinum is
      added to 5.0 kg of the alloy.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Empirical evidence has demonstrated that the fuel catalyst
      improves the combustion process in diesel, gasoline, alcohol (both
      methanol and ethanol), and heating oil. Testing conducted by the
      Advanced Propulsion Technology Center, Oak Ridge National
      Laboratory, for example, confirmed that treatment of fuel with the
      elements 16 changed the composition of fuel, in the direction of
      higher octane, higher energy fuel constituents, for gasoline,
      Indolene and diesel. The method of analysis chosen was gas
      chromatography followed by mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS).
      GC/MS is capable of determining the chemical composition of
      complex mixtures of organic compounds such as fuels. Testing was
      conducted using catalyst packs containing 3.5 inch diameter
      elements, of the type described above, in a polyethylene cage. Two
      250 ml samples each of diesel fuel, gasoline (unleaded, 87
      octane), and Indolene (a research gasoline) were placed in
      pre-cleaned, amber glass bottles fitted with Teflon (tm) lined
      caps. <br>
      <br>
      An element pack was placed in one jar of each type of fuel, shaken
      for one minute, and left to stand for 12 hours. A 25 ml aliquot of
      each fuel, treated and untreated was then taken and put into
      precleaned 40 ml headspace sampling vials and provided for GC/MS
      analysis. The GC/MS analysis consisted of a 0.5 ml sample from the
      headspace of each vial (i.e. a sample of the vapors above the fuel
      in the vial). A splitless injection was made of each sample onto a
      60 m DB-624 capillary column, cryogenically cooled inside a
      Hewlett-Packard (HP) 5890 Series 11 GC to 0 degrees Celsius. The
      GC run conditions were 0 Celsius for 10 min., then 0-250 Celsius
      at 3 C./min, which resulted in excellent separation of the
      components. Detection was accomplished with an HP 5971 MSD,
      controlled by HP Chemstation software.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The six reconstructed ion chromatograms for the treated and
      untreated gasoline, Indolene, and diesel fuels, respectively, are
      shown in FIGS. 3-8. Detailed data analysis was performed using the
      Chemstation software. The results of these experiments show major
      changes occurred in the fuel samples. Cursory comparison of the
      untreated and treated fuels in FIGS. 3-8 show that the elements
      changed the amounts of individual components in the fuel samples
      by large amounts. As shown in FIG. 3, the treated gasoline, shows
      many more large peaks eluting between 40 and 80 minutes of the
      run, in comparison to the untreated gasoline in FIG. 4. It should
      be noted that concentration is proportional to peak height in the
      figures. When peaks could be identified, based on their mass
      spectrum, their identity has been indicated next to the peak. As
      an example, the three peaks in FIG. 4 between 50 and 51.2 minutes
      are identified as the three isomers of xylene. The peaks range in
      height from about 200,000 to 500,000 units. <br>

      In FIG. 3, the same isomers of xylene range in height from
      1,200,000 to 2,500,000, an increase of approximately five-fold in
      concentration. Similar changes in peak height are observed for the
      diesel fuel and the Indolene.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In the case of gasoline, most of the change was observed in
      the region of the chromatogram from 40 to 80 minutes. This region
      of the chromatogram is where the compounds which increase the
      octane of gasoline elute. Results for saturated alkanes are shown
      in FIGS. 9A-9C and 10A-10C. Only those compounds with mass 57, 71,
      and 85, masses indicative of alkanes, are shown in FIGS. 9A-9C and
      10A-10C. The treated gasoline has many more of these compounds in
      the higher boiling portion of the chromatogram, indicating that
      the catalyst elements form these compounds, most likely by
      cracking longer chain paraffins. Accordingly, the treated gas has
      much more octane, nonane and decane than the untreated gas, which
      would mean higher octane. Furthermore, FIG. 11 shows an annotated
      chromatogram of the 40-80 minute portion of the treated gasoline
      in FIG. 3. Whereas FIG. 4 shows almost no compounds eluting in
      this region, there are many which were tentatively identified in
      FIG. 11. These compounds are mostly aromatic in nature, meaning
      they are based on benzene. Thus, FIG. 18 shows toluene (methyl
      benzene), the xylenes, ethyl benzenes, and various isomers of
      C3-benzene and C4-benzene. The aromatic hydrocarbons have the most
      energy per unit carbon, and thus have the highest octane rating,
      so the catalyst treatment appears to increase octane and energy
      content of the gasoline by forming aromatic compounds. Although
      the exact source of these compounds could not be determined from
      this initial experimental analysis, they were believed to derive
      from asphaltenes (high molecular weight tars) and other polycyclic
      aromatic which contaminate all commercial gasolines. Accordingly,
      the net effect of the treatment of the fuel by the elements
      appeared to be the increase of high octane, high energy
      constituents in the gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Changes were also observed between the treated and
      untreated Indolene. FIGS. 12A-12C and 13A-13C show masses 77, 91,
      and 105, indicative of benzene, toluene, and xylene, respectively,
      for the treated and untreated Indolene. The treated Indolene shows
      a much higher proportion of xylenes than the untreated fuel. It is
      believed that the C3-benzenes and C4-benzenes are being converted
      by the catalyst elements to these compounds. Diesel fuel is
      primarily made up of C8 to C18 saturated alkanes, with the bulk
      cut being between C12 and C16. The lighter ends lower the cetane
      number of diesel, and the heavier ends are not efficiently burned.
      FIGS. 7 and 9 are annotated to show the different C values. The
      addition of each carbon results in even spacing in time between
      peaks. The scale in FIG. 8 shows that the C7, C8, C9,
      concentrations are about the same in the treated fuel illustrated
      in FIG. 7. The amount of C10- C12 is much greater in the treated
      fuel. Specifically an almost tenfold increase is observed. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, it appears that the catalyst elements are cracking the
      long-chain paraffins to form the lower molecular weight saturated
      alkanes. Aromatics are generally not very abundant in diesel, so
      the aromatic derivatives that showed up in the gasoline are
      absent. In addition to the above testing, fuel treatment devices
      in accordance with the invention have been certified by the United
      States Environmental Protection <br>
      <br>
      Agency as having satisfied all of the requirements of 40 C.F.R.
      [section]85.2114, based on tests conducted by various agencies
      which verified substantial decreases in hydrocarbon, carbon
      monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide and fuel soot
      emissions. Further, tests conducted by the University of
      Pittsburgh Applied Research Center (Battery Technology Center)
      confirm that the elements 16 act as true catalysts and do not
      dissolve into the fuel being treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Accordingly, while the fuel catalyst has been proven
      effective by a variety of testing methods, the actual mechanism
      that allows the fuel catalyst to function in such a variety of
      chemically dissimilar fuels has not been understood. Accordingly,
      further improvements can only be obtained through empirical
      processes unless the basic underlying mechanism is identified. To
      this end, extensive study has been focused on gaining an
      understanding of the underlying mechanism so that further fuel
      catalysts could be developed using an analytical approach.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] It is now believed that the basic underlying mechanism of
      the operation of the fuel catalyst lies in the liberation of
      hydrogen gas from the fuel through a catalytic action. The fuel
      catalyst described above utilizes antimony, tin, lead and mercury.
      Antimony and tin, in particular, act as hydride producers in
      protonic solvents. When acidic groups are present, the elements of
      the fuel catalyst act in a similar manner to an electrolysis cell.
      The elements act as a set of short-circuited galvanic cells, in
      which the one or more elements is a common anode (with a high
      overvoltage for hydrogen evolution) and one or more elements act
      as a cathode (with relatively low hydrogen overvoltages). Metal
      ions leave the common anode while hydrogen gas is evolved from the
      cathode.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In weak acid solutions, both antimony and tin produce the
      hydrides Stibine (SbH3) and Stannane (SnH4) when a more active
      electrolytic element (less noble) and a less active electrolytic
      element (more noble), for example lead and mercury, are present.
      These hydrides are very unstable and decompose rapidly to produce
      hydrogen and the parent metal, especially in the presence of
      dissimilar metals. In hydrocarbon fuels, there are always acidic
      impurities and water, which is soluble to some extent in all
      fuels. These supply labile hydrogen ions to the fuel catalyst to
      allow the liberation of hydrogen in small and safe quantities. It
      is therefore believed that the hydrogen resulting from the
      catalytic action is responsible for improving the combustion
      process, allowing the improvements that have been observed in
      power, reduction of pollutants and particulates, and an increase
      in mileage.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Tests have been conducted to confirm hydrogen liberation
      through the catalytic reaction. Two milliliters of buffered
      hydrochloric acid was placed in a flask containing 200 ml ethanol
      and fuel catalyst elements. Resulting hydrogen gas was burned off
      by the application of a flame to a side arm of the flask.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] While it has been known that the introduction of a
      relatively small amounts of hydrogen in hydrocarbon fuels can
      dramatically increase horsepower and reduce emissions of
      atmospheric pollutants, it has been difficult to find a safe and
      simple way of introducing hydrogen into the combustion process.
      Prior methods of utilizing electrolytic cells, where hydrogen is
      produced at the cathode, or tanks of compressed hydrogen gas, or
      palladium-hydrogen systems, where the correct application of heat
      drives off hydrogen gas, are complicated, bulky and cumbersome. In
      contrast, the use of the fuel catalyst to produce hydrogen as fuel
      flows over the catalyst is simple and safe. Utilizing the fuel
      catalyst, hydrogen is released in proportion to fuel flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In view of the above, it is now possible to analytically
      design fuel catalysts using hydride producing elements, for
      example, by utilizing hydride producing elements from Group IV and
      Group V of the periodic table in combination with elements that
      are more active and less active on the electrolytic scale.
      Accordingly, metals such as mercury and lead may be replaced with
      metals such as zinc, magnesium, aluminum, palladium, silver,
      copper and cerium. Using the above information, fuel catalyst
      elements having 40 %wt zinc, 40 %wt antimony, 18 %wt tin and 2 %
      wt silver were prepared using a smelting process. For example, the
      antimony, tin and silver are combined and melted in a crucible at
      a temperature of 1100- 1200 degrees F. and stirred until
      completely alloyed. The zinc is then added to the mixture and it
      is either poured into molds and cast or dropped to form shot. The
      fuel catalyst was then compared with the fuel catalyst of U.S.
      Pat. No. 5,580,359 described above and a control using no fuel
      catalyst. <br>
      <br>
      Six independent runs were made for the control, the fuel catalyst
      of U.S. Pat. No. 5,580,359 and the analytically developed new fuel
      catalyst described above, while measurements of CO, CO2, HC and O2
      were taken. The averaged results of the six runs are illustrated
      in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      TABLE 1<br>

      <br>
      [0046] The test results indicated that the '359 fuel catalyst
      decreased carbon monoxide by 53% and hydrocarbons by 42%, while
      the analytically developed new fuel catalyst actually performed
      better by reducing carbon monoxide by 63% and hydrocarbons by 50%.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Based on the results obtained, it is believed that catalyst
      elements containing variations of 10-80 %wt zinc, 20-60 %wt
      antimony, 1-5 %wt silver and 10-30 %wt tin will yield beneficial
      results. Other combinations are also possible. A further preferred
      embodiment includes 0.1-1.0 %wt palladium, 20-80 %wt magnesium,
      20-60 %wt antimony, 10-30 %wt tin and 1-8 %wt cerium, with a
      further preferred embodiment within the above ranges includes 0.2
      %wt palladium, 30 %wt magnesium, 40 %wt antimony, 25 %wt tin and
      4.8 %wt cerium. A still further embodiment includes 39 %wt zinc,
      11 %wt aluminum, 25 %wt tin and 25 %wt antimony.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The interaction between the catalyst elements and the mild
      steel is not fully appreciated at this time. It is believed that
      the mild steel is also acting in combination with the catalyst
      elements as a material that is more active on the electrolytic
      scale. In order to avoid problems with corrosion of steel mesh,
      attempts were made to replace the steel screens with non-corrosive
      #316 stainless steel screens. It was found, however, that <b>#316
        stainless steel appeared to adversely impact the efficiency of
        the fuel catalyst.</b> It was discovered, however, that an alloy
      of nickel and copper, for example<b> Monel 400 could be
        successfully utilized in place of the mild steel.</b> Other
      alloys may also be utilized including Monel 404, Monel 405 and
      Monel K500, as well as other types of alloys having equivalent
      properties. For example, brass, copper and alloys of copper and
      nickel are also suitable. In such cases, it is believed that the
      copper is acting in combination with the fuel catalyst elements as
      an element of greater activity on the electrolytic scale.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Depending on the formulation of fuel catalyst element
      chosen and its intended application, the use of a steel or alloy
      container or screens may not be required. For example, based on
      the acid test results provided above, the fuel catalyst alone is
      sufficient to cause the generation of hydrogen when combined with
      fuel. In fact, it appears to be an advantage of the invention that
      the fuel catalyst works in conjunction with the acid in the fuel,
      as the fuel catalyst actually works better for "dirty" fuels, i.e.
      acid containing, as compared with "clean" fuels. In certain
      applications, it may actually be desirable to add acid to the fuel
      to increase hydrogen production, either by treating the fuel in
      bulk or including an acid injecting mechanism within the
      combustion system.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] All of the above fuel catalyst elements may be incorporated
      into a plurality of different containers for treating fuel. FIGS.
      14 and 15, for example, illustrate a further embodiment of an
      in-line housing 26 in which a plurality of catalyst elements 16
      are separated into three levels by mild steel screens or
      separators 28. Further, FIG. 16 illustrates an in-line housing 30
      wherein a plurality of elements 16 are retained within mild steel
      screen mesh retainer 32 located in the cylindrical housing 30
      having threaded end caps 34. FIG. 17 illustrates an in-line
      housing 35 in which a plurality of elements 16 are retained in
      element spacers 37, of a type illustrated in FIGS. 18 and 19, in
      combination with Monel screens or washers.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Still further, all of the above fuel catalyst elements may
      be incorporated into drop-in type housings. FIGS. 20-21 illustrate
      a drop-in housing or cage 36 comprising a snap-fit plastic
      container in which a plurality of elements 16 can be retained.
      Holes 38, 40 are provided in the housing 36 to permit fuel to pass
      through the housing 36 and contact the elements 16. The drop-in
      housing 36 is dropped into a steel fuel tank in order to treat
      fuel, and is particularly useful for small engine applications
      including, for example, lawn maintenance equipment. When the
      drop-in housing 36 is utilized in plastic fuel tanks, it is
      preferable that the housing be made of mild steel, Monel or an
      appropriate alloy or that screens be used to retain the elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The invention has been described with reference to certain
      preferred embodiments thereof. It will be understood, however,
      that modifications and variations are possible within the scope of
      the appended claims. For example, the catalyst element can be
      formed into any desired shape f or use within any desired type of
      housing. Alternatively, the catalyst element can be formed as a
      dry power or a semi-dry paste and poured directly into a fuel tank
      or formed as part of the fuel distribution system of a vehicle,
      burner, furnace or other combustion device. The housing or
      container retaining the elements may also be formed in any desired
      shape.<br>

      The efficiency of fuel combustion is improved by adding to the
      fuel an additive that includes tin, antimony, lead and mercury.
      The additive may include by weight 60-80% tin, 15-30% antimony,
      2-7% lead and 3-12% mercury.<br>
      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to fuel additives and more
      particularly concerns a formulation of metals which when
      introduced into fuel can increase efficiency and performance,
      reduce wear on moving parts, reduce carbon deposits and improve
      exhaust emissions.<br>
      <br>
      According to one aspect of the present invention, a fuel additive
      consists of tin, antimony, lead, and mercury. The preferred
      percentages by weight are, apart from impurities, 60 to 80 % wt.
      tin, 15 to 30 % wt. antimony, 2 to 7 % wt. lead and 3 to 12 % wt.
      mercury.<br>
      <br>
      In use, it is believed that a chemical reaction takes place
      between the additive and the fuel and that the products of the
      chemical reaction are traced into the fuel in minute molecular
      form, thereby not only improving the combustion of the fuel but
      reducing the friction of moving parts in contact with the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel may be, for example, any grade of oil, petrol or diesel.
      The introduction of the fuel additive may occur, for example, in a
      fuel storage tank or in a fuel line or both. The fuel storage tank
      may be formed of steel, in which case the chemical reaction may
      include the tank. Alternatively, the fuel storage tank may be
      formed of a plastics material, in which case the additive may be
      enveloped or otherwise housed in a steel container so that the
      chemical reaction may include the container. The fuel line may
      lead to, for example, an internal combustion engine, a boiler or
      furnace.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel additive itself may be formed as a dry powder or a
      semi-dry paste. This is particularly convenient where the fuel
      additive is to be used primarily as a lubricant to reduce
      friction, or even totally as a lubricant in non-combustion
      applications, Alternatively, the fuel additive may be formed by,
      for example, casting, extruding, cutting or shaping to have the
      shape of, for example, a mesh, rod, plate, ball or tube. The fuel
      additive may be formed separately from other components.
      Alternatively, the fuel additive may be formed integrally with a
      component such as a fuel filter.<br>
      <br>
      It is presently preferred that the fuel additive is cast into the
      shape of a cone.<br>
      <br>
      It is also presently preferred that the fuel additive has a
      composition of 70 to 75 % wt. tin, 15 to 25 % wt. antimony, 2 to 4
      % wt. lead and 3 to 7 % wt. mercury and is manufactured by the
      following method:<br>
      <br>
      A) The tin, antimony and lead are melted together in a mild steel
      pot to approximately 50 DEG C. above the melting temperature and
      the resultant liquid is stirred for 3 to 4 minutes using a mild
      steel rod or bar.<br>
      <br>
      B) The mercury is added, the temperature is increased a further 50
      DEG to 100 DEG C. and the resultant liquid is stirred for a
      further 2 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      C) The liquid is poured, by use of a mild or stainless steel
      ladle, into cone-shaped moulds in a mould block, which if formed
      of mild steel and is pre-heated to a temperature sufficient to
      prevent the liquid from setting in less than one second after
      pouring.<br>
      <br>
      Chill cooling adversely affects the metallurgical properties of
      the fuel additive.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that mis-cast cones, or any of the formulation
      allowed to set in the melting pot, may be re-melted and re-cast
      provided that the total time lapse after the addition of the
      mercury does not exceed 45 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      According to another aspect of the present invention, a fuel
      additive of any composition, but preferably a formulation of
      metals, is provided in combination with magnetic material such as
      permanent ferrite magnets, the intention being that the
      electrostatic charge on the fuel, and preferably also on the
      products of the chemical reaction, is altered in a beneficial
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel additive, and its combination with magnetic material, in
      accordance with the present invention is shown, by way of example
      only, in the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIG. 1 is a longitudinal section through a container which
        houses the magnetic material as well as the fuel additive;</b><b><br>

      <br>
      In the accompanying drawings, a cylindrical two-part container of
      plastics material is provided with a fuel inlet at one end a fuel
      outlet at the other end. In passing through the container, the
      fuel sequentially passes through spacers adjacent a mild steel
      mesh disc, a first set of three cones adjacent another mild steel
      mesh disc, a second set of three cones adjacent further spacers,
      and a pair of ferrite permanent magnets held in parallel
      relationship by a pair of magnet spacers of plastics material. The
      material of the cones is the fuel additive of the present
      invention, each of the cones having a base diameter of
      approximately 20 mm. Although six cones have been indicated, the
      particular number required naturally depends upon the particular
      application. Altering the number of the cones will naturally
      affect the number of the spacers, which are again of plastics
      material formed as circular discs with both perforations and
      protrusions. The number of the mild steel mesh discs may also be
      affected.<br>

      The purpose of the permanent magnets is to alter the electrostatic
      charge on the fuel as the fuel passes through the flux created by
      the permanent magnets so that the fuel is more likely to ignite
      and burn. In particular, the combustion chemistry of the fuel is
      enhanced and the rate of thermal heat transfer away from the
      combustion zone is increased. In an internal combustion engine, it
      is found that there is a smoother more efficient and reliable
      engine which lasts longer, the engine oil lasting longer and the
      carbon monoxide, nitric oxide and particulates in the exhaust
      emissions being reduced.<br>

      In a storage tank for oil, the fuel additive is also found to give
      the advantages of keeping the oil in better condition by reducing
      bacterial growth and reducing gelling in cold weather.<br>

      In an alternative embodiment, the additives may be made from an
      alloy which is approximately 75% weight tin, 21% weight antimony
      and 4% weight lead. To 5.0 kg of the alloy is added 0.5 kg of
      mercury (as a releasing agent) and 0.020 kg platinum (as a
      catalyst).<br>
