      <br>
      Amazing. A gizmo which sucks the air in, then sucks the water out
      of the air, and then spews out clean fresh water. 500 Gallons of
      it&nbsp; a day. Every off-grid home should have one. Only problem
      is it’ll set you back a cool $500,000 . FEMA have already bought
      two, and the US Army is said to be on the verge of buying many,
      because getting our boys pure water is one of the key logistics
      requirements of any operational planning.<br>
      <br>
      The box o’ tricks is from Aqua Sciences Inc, and the company says
      the high cost is justified because in the end it “only costs you
      $0.25 per gallon. For those of us without an entire battalion at
      our command, however the price is still a little steep. The makers
      are working on a consumer model, but it won’t be out any time
      soon.<br>
      <br>
      Its precise workings aren’t public, but they use a chemical
      process similar to the one that causes salt to absorb moisture
      from the air (and clump up your saltshaker). The water-harvesting
      technology was originally the brainchild of the Pentagon’s Defense
      Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which sought ways to
      ensure sustainable water supplies for U.S. combat troops deployed
      in arid regions like Iraq.<br>
      <br>
      Darpa gave millions to research companies like LexCarb and
      Sciperio to create a contraption that could capture water in the
      Mesopotamian desert. But it was Aqua Sciences, that was first to
      put a product on the market that can operate in harsh climates.<br>
      <br>
      “People have been trying to figure out how to do this for years,
      and we just came out of left field in response to Darpa,” said Abe
      Sher, chief executive officer of Aqua Sciences. “The atmosphere is
      a river full of water, even in the desert. It won’t work
      absolutely everywhere, but it works virtually everywhere.”<br>
      <br>
      Sher said he is “not at liberty” to disclose details of the
      government contracts, except that Aqua Sciences won two highly
      competitive bids with “some very sophisticated companies.”<br>
      <br>
      He also declined to comment on how the technology actually works.<br>
      <br>
      “This is our secret sauce,” Sher said. “Like Kentucky Fried
      Chicken, it tastes good, but we won’t tell you what’s in it.”<br>
      <br>
      “We figured out how to tap it in a very unique and proprietary
      way,” Sher said. “We figured out how to mimic nature, using
      natural salt to extract water and act as a natural
      decontamination.<br>
      <br>
      “Think of the Dead Sea, where nothing grows around it because the
      salt dehydrates everything. It’s kind of like that.”<br>
      <br>
      The 20-foot machine can churn out 600 gallons of water a day
      without using or producing toxic materials and byproducts.<br>
      <br>
      Jason Rowe, chief of staff to Rep. Tom Feeney, Florida Republican,
      called the technology “pretty impressive.”<br>
      <br>
      “I was pretty blown away by the things it’s able to do,” Rowe
      said. “The fact that this technology is not tied to humidity like
      others are makes it an attractive alternative for military bases
      in the Mideast where humidity is not really an option.<br>
      <br>
      “It seems like it’s a cheaper alternative to trucking in bottled
      water, which has a shelf life,” said Rowe, who described himself
      as a fiscal hawk.<br>
      <br>
      Once deployed, the machines could reduce the cost of logistical
      support for supplying water to the troops in Iraq by billions of
      dollars, said Stuart Roy, spokesman of the DCI Group, Aqua
      Sciences’ public affairs firm.<br>
      <br>
      The cost to transport water by C-17 cargo planes, then truck it to
      the troops, runs $30 a gallon. The cost, including the machines
      from Aqua Sciences, will be reduced to 30 cents a gallon, Roy
      said.<br>
      <br>
      Several systems on the market can create water through
      condensation, but the process requires a high level of humidity.
      Aqua Sciences’ machines only require 14 percent humidity, Roy
      said. “That’s why this technology is superior and why they are
      getting the contracts.”<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Our patented and patent pending technology makes it possible to
      extract vast amounts of safe drinking water from the air in almost
      any climate and under nearly every condition, even in the desert.<br>
      <br>
      Aqua Sciences’ systems collect and dispense hundreds to thousands
      of gallons of water daily by capturing and processing naturally
      occurring water molecules from the air.<br>
      <br>
      This is done at relatively low costs and without producing harmful
      or toxic by-products.<br>

      <b>Mobile Water Production &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Florida-based Aqua Sciences, Inc. was formed to bring a product to
      market that literally extracts vast amounts of water from the
      atmosphere and outputs drinking water. Our patented water
      extraction technology was developed over 15 years and with more
      than $25 million invested in research, development and production.<br>
      <br>
      Aqua Sciences’ flagship product is the Emergency Water Station
      (EWS). The 40 foot model produces up to 2,600 gallons of water per
      day (depending on local atmospheric conditions). Specially
      designed for transport by air, sea or land in an International
      Standards Organization (ISO) marine container, the Aqua Sciences
      EWS is powered by self-contained electrical generators or external
      power. It is a compelling first and ongoing response solution for
      areas with damaged or no infrastructure throughout the world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>KEY BENEFITS:</b><br>
      <br>
      Excellent Water Quality: Meets and exceeds US EPA (Environmental
      Protection Agency), World Health Organization and US Military
      specifications.<br>
      <br>
      Significant Water Quantity: Provides drinking water for up to
      5,200 people per day. (Per FEMA (Federal Emergency Management
      Agency), a normally active person needs 0.5 to 1 gallon per day
      for drinking.)<br>
      <br>
      Proven: Successfully deployed in the largest natural disaster in
      the history of the Western Hemisphere in early 2010 by a US
      Southern Command mission and saved lives at the University
      Hospital in Port Au Prince. Consistently made water and met
      customer needs during a 37-day desert test at a 100-person oil rig
      in the Middle East in the summer of 2010. Aqua Sciences has won
      highly competitive procurements issued by the US Army and FEMA.<br>
      <br>
      Cost-effective: Highly competitive in cost and more economical
      than existing solutions in areas of need.<br>
      <br>
      Fully “Off the Grid”: Does not require outside water or power to
      generate drinking water. Since the machine extracts only water
      molecules from the air, it eliminates the need for complex and
      high-maintenance filtration systems such as Reverse Osmosis
      Purification (ROWPU). It is ideal for areas with contaminated
      groundwater.<br>
      <br>
      Works in Virtually Any Environment, even in Desert Conditions:
      Aqua Sciences systems are NOT conventional refrigerant
      dehumidification (CRD) systems that condense water by cooling
      ambient air to the dew point and that are not suitable for low
      humidity conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Scalable: Aqua Sciences systems can be built for daily water needs
      of less than a hundred people to several thousand. <br>

        <b>SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING WATER</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A method for producing water includes removing water from a first
      airflow using a first process which includes exposing at least
      some of the first airflow to a desiccant. This increases water
      content of at least some of the desiccant. At least some of the
      desiccant having increased water content is introduced into a
      second airflow. This facilitates evaporation of water from the
      desiccant into the second airflow, and increases water content of
      the second airflow. Water is then removed from the second airflow.<br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to a system and method for
      producing water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Background Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] Conventionally, water is collected from air using
      condensation systems. An exemplary condensation system provides a
      surface cooled to a temperature that is at or below the dew point
      of incoming air. As is well known in the art, the cooling of air
      at or below its dew point causes the condensation of water vapor
      from the air and a decrease in the absolute humidity of the air.
      The humidity of a volume of air is substantially determinative of
      the amount of water that can be introduced into, or removed from,
      the volume of air.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Existing water generation systems collect water vapor from
      incoming airflows using conventional condensation systems that
      lower the temperature of incoming air to a temperature that is at
      or below the dew point of the air. Therefore, the quantity of
      water produced by such systems depends on the humidity of the
      ambient air. The humidity and temperature of air varies, however,
      from region to region, with hot and humid air in tropical and
      semi-tropical regions, and cooler, less humid air in other parts
      of the world. The temperature and water vapor content of air also
      varies widely with seasonal weather changes in regions throughout
      the year.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] As a result it has been found that the water dispensing
      capability of prior art air-to-water generating systems is
      severely impaired in regions and seasons of low humidity.
      Conventional machines only produce enough water when the humidity
      is above a certain threshold percentage. This is too high a
      humidity level for climate controlled buildings, thereby rendering
      the machines less useful for most commercial and residential
      purposes and in certain portions of the world where the humidity
      level is low.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Therefore, there is a need for a system and method for
      producing water even when the humidity and dew point of ambient
      air are low.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] The present invention provides a system and method for
      producing water even when the humidity and dew point of ambient
      air are low.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The invention also provides a method for producing water
      that includes removing water from a first airflow using a first
      process which includes exposing at least some of the first airflow
      to a desiccant. This increases the water content of at least some
      of the desiccant. At least some of the desiccant having increased
      water content is introduced into a second airflow, thereby
      facilitating evaporation of water from the desiccant into the
      second airflow. This also increases water content of the second
      airflow. Water is then removed from the second airflow after its
      water content is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The invention further provides a method for producing water
      using a system including first and second chambers and a heat
      exchanger. The method includes passing a first airflow through the
      first chamber. At least some of the first airflow is exposed to a
      desiccant in the first chamber. This removes water from the first
      airflow and increases water content of the desiccant. At least
      some of the desiccant having increased water content is introduced
      into the second chamber. A second airflow is passed through the
      second chamber to facilitate evaporation of water from the
      desiccant into the second airflow. The second airflow is passed
      through the heat exchanger after its water content is increased.
      This facilitates cooling of second airflow and condensation of the
      water therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The invention also provides a system for producing water
      that includes a first chamber having an inlet and an outlet for
      facilitating movement of a first airflow into and out of the first
      chamber. The system also includes a desiccant capable of being
      introduced into the first chamber for removing water from the
      first airflow moving through the first chamber. A second chamber
      is configured to receive at least a portion of the desiccant after
      it removes water from the first airflow. The second chamber
      includes an inlet and an outlet for facilitating movement of a
      second airflow into and out of the second chamber. This
      facilitates evaporation of water from the desiccant in the second
      chamber into the second airflow. A system heat exchanger is
      configured to receive the second airflow from the second chamber
      and to facilitate cooling of the second airflow to extract water
      therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention further provides a system for
      extracting water from air. This system includes a desiccant
      collection chamber wherein a solid desiccant or desiccant solution
      is exposed to physical contact with a first air stream, and
      wherein diluted desiccant is produced. Also provided is a
      desiccant regeneration chamber. The desiccant is warmed and
      introduced into the second chamber. There, the desiccant is
      exposed to physical contact with a second air stream, wherein
      humid air is produced. The humid air stream is placed in physical
      contact with a condenser so that water vapor is condensed from the
      humid air stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention also provides a system and method for
      passing ambient air into a first chamber having a suitable
      desiccant material therein. The desiccant absorbs or adsorbs
      moisture from the air that comes in contact with the desiccant. In
      one embodiment, the air contacts desiccant by pumping air through
      a contact surface, such as a sponge, media, cooling coil, or
      cooling tower, that has desiccant dispersed therein. The desiccant
      and/or first chamber may be cooled to enable the more efficient
      transfer of water from the air to the desiccant. The desiccant
      absorbs or adsorbs water from the air, thereby transferring latent
      heat from the air as the water undergoes a phase change and
      condenses out of the air. Because the desiccant and/or first
      chamber are cooled, sensible cooling-i.e., cooling that is not
      based on a change of state-is also provided to the air. The
      resulting dry, cooled air is drawn out from the first chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The now hydrous desiccant collects at the bottom of the
      first chamber and gets transferred to a second chamber. The second
      chamber transfer occurs either through active pumping or diffusion
      via a valve opening provided in a partition between the first and
      the second chambers. The valve opening enables equalization of
      desiccant levels in the first and the second chamber. The net flow
      of hydrous desiccant occurs from the first chamber to the second
      chamber until the level of the desiccant equalizes in the two
      chambers. The diffused or pumped hydrous desiccant in the second
      chamber can be heated and then again exposed to air. In one
      embodiment, the desiccant is sprayed into the interior of the
      second chamber. A heat exchanger such as a heating element warms
      the spray of hydrous desiccant falling from the nozzles, thereby
      evaporating moisture absorbed or adsorbed into the desiccant,
      generating hot humid air, and also regenerating substantially
      anhydrous desiccant.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The desiccant can be introduced into the chambers by any
      method effective to achieve the desired result. For example, the
      first chamber may include spongy cellulose material through which
      the hydrated desiccant percolates down to collect at the bottom of
      the chamber. Alternatively, the desiccant is made to simply drip
      in the form of drops from points within, such as the top of, the
      first and second chambers.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The present invention can also utilize the temperature
      differential between the dry air coming out of the first chamber
      and the hotter and humid air manufactured in the second chamber,
      to effect transference of thermal energy between the two air
      streams without bringing them into physical contact with each
      other. For example, a heat exchanger, such as a radiator-type
      exchanger comprising a plurality of tubing or pipes, can be used
      to bring two air streams into thermal contact. The hotter and more
      humid air from the second chamber can be passed through the
      radiator, while the relatively cool, dry air contacts the outer
      surfaces of the radiator via a duct that draws in the dry air from
      the first chamber. This results in condensation of water vapor in
      the heat exchanger into liquid water that drips down to collect in
      a condensate collector. Alternatively, the hot humid air can be
      directed to contact the dew-forming surfaces of a heat absorber,
      such as an evaporator, that are cooled using a suitable cooling
      process such as classic boiling fluids contained in tubes,
      thermoelectric elements, heat pipes, refrigerant-expansion coils
      or any other system known to persons of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] At least one embodiment of the present invention can
      sterilize and filter the condensed water to generate pure drinking
      water. Accordingly, in one embodiment, condensed water from the
      condensate collector is exposed to suitable ultra-violet (UV)
      radiation in a UV unit to free the water from harmful microscopic
      organisms. Additionally, the radiated water is serially passed
      through a charcoal filter to remove contaminants and Volatile
      Organic Compounds (VOC's) and a plurality of mineral cartridges to
      mineralize and/or vitaminize the water. The purified and
      mineralized water is collected in a first storage tank.
      Additionally, the water is passed through an oxygenator before
      being stored in the first storage tank. Water from the first
      storage tank is recirculated through the UV unit at predetermined
      intervals of time to maintain quality of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] At least one embodiment of the present invention can also
      dispense hot and cold water. Thus, in one embodiment, water from
      the first storage tank is gravity fed into a second cold storage
      tank from where it is further gravity fed into a third hot storage
      tank. Water in the second storage tank is chilled using a suitable
      cooling process such as Peltier-effect or chemical/magnetic
      cooling, by the use of a typical expansion-evaporation coils, or
      by any other method effective to achieve the desired result. The
      cold water is then dispensed through a first childproof spigot.
      Also, water in the third tank is heated to a desired temperature
      by a heating element and dispensed through a second spigot.
      Ambient temperature water is dispensed from the second spigot when
      power is disallowed to the heating element of the third tank. In
      another embodiment, water from the first storage tank can be
      directly dispensed through a third spigot to provide water at
      ambient temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The present invention may also be configured to provide for
      the introduction of water from external sources in the event of
      low condensate formation. Accordingly, an external source such as
      a municipal supply faucet is attached through quick-disconnect
      fittings to supply supplemental water to the first storage tank.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)</b><br>
      <br>
      [0024] FIG. 1 shows a simplified schematic diagram of a water
      producing system 10 in accordance with one embodiment of the
      present invention. The system 10 includes a humid air
      manufacturing stage 12, a water extraction stage 14, a water
      purification and filtration stage 16, and a water dispensing stage
      18. As described in more detail below, the humid air manufacturing
      stage 12 includes processes for removing moisture from an ambient
      air mass, and transferring it into another air mass by use of a
      desiccant material. The moisture collected in the desiccant
      material is evaporated into the second air mass, which results in
      the generation of warmer air with higher humidity than the initial
      ambient air.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The water extraction stage 14 includes a heat exchanger or
      absorber that cools the humid air stream manufactured in stage 12.
      The air stream is cooled to its dew point, thereby resulting in
      condensation of water vapor and production of liquid water. The
      condensed liquid water may be filtered and/or otherwise purified
      at stage 16 by any number of purification and/or filtration
      devices. Such devices may include a bacteriostat loop which serves
      to destroy adventitious living organisms, and filters which filter
      out undesirable contaminants. Filtration and/or purification
      systems used in stage 16 can be configured to reduce contaminants
      and VOC's to a level defined by National Science Foundation (NSF)
      Standard 53. A recirculation loop may also be provided to
      recirculate stored condensate during periods of inactivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The water dispensing stage 18 can include a plurality of
      storage tank systems to dispense water through spigots. Various
      components in the water dispensing stage can include
      quick-disconnect fittings to facilitate easy assembly and
      reconfiguration. Flexible tubing can also be used so that the
      water can be remotely dispensed, and so that a secondary water
      source, such as a municipal water supply, can be incorporated into
      the system 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 2 shows the humid air manufacturing stage 12 and the
      water extraction stage 14 in detail. In the embodiment shown in
      FIG. 2, the humid air manufacturing stage 12 includes a first
      chamber, or collection chamber 20, and a second chamber, or
      regeneration chamber 22. The collection chamber 20 includes an
      inlet 24 and an outlet 26 which allow a first airflow 28 to flow
      through the collection chamber 20. As the air flows through the
      collection chamber 20, it is subjected to a first process which
      includes exposing it to a desiccant 30, which, in the embodiment
      shown in FIG. 2, is a liquid. The liquid desiccant 30 is sprayed
      into the first chamber 20 via a conduit 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As the first airflow 28 moves through the collection
      chamber 20, vaporized water is condensed out, and collects with
      the desiccant 30 in the bottom portion 34 of the chamber 20. The
      desiccant 30 is diluted as it adsorbs or absorbs the water from
      the first airflow 28. Although the desiccant 30 shown in FIG. 2 is
      liquid, the present invention contemplates the use of solid
      desiccants, or dual phase desiccants-e.g., solid and liquid. Any
      desiccant material effective to produce the desired result may be
      used, including solids, liquids, solutions, aqueous solutions,
      mixtures, and combinations thereof. Lithium chloride (LiCl) and
      calcium chloride (CaCl2) are typical of liquid desiccant
      solutions, but other liquid desiccants may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Liquid desiccants such as polycols, alone or in mixture,
      may be used. Typical polycols include liquid compounds such as
      ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentylene
      glycol, glycerol, trimethyol propane, diethytlene glycol,
      triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol,
      tripropylene glycol, tetrapropylene glycol, and mixtures thereof.
      Polyol compounds which are normally solid, but which are
      substantially soluble in anhydrous liquid polyols or liquid
      hydroxyl amines, may also be used. Typical of these solid polyol
      compounds are erythritol, sorbitol, pentaerythritol and low
      molecular weight sugars. Typical hydroxyl amines include
      alkanolamines, such as monoethanol amine, diethanol amine,
      triethanol amine, isopropanol amine, including mono, di, and tri,
      isopropanol amine or digylcolamine.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Still other types of desiccants such as montmorillonite
      clay, silica gel, molecular sieves, CaO, CaSO4 can all be used. As
      would be evident to persons of ordinary skill in the art, the
      selection of a desirable desiccant depends, among other
      parameters, upon the temperature and humidity ranges of ambient
      air from which moisture is to be absorbed. Still other exemplary
      desiccants comprise materials such as P2O5, BaO, Al2O3, NaOH
      sticks, KOH fused, CaBr2, ZnCl2, Ba(ClO4)2, ZnBr2.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] As noted above, the desiccant 30 is a liquid desiccant,
      which may comprise an aqueous solution of 40% lithium chloride.
      The desiccant 30 is pumped into the conduit 32 by a pump 36. The
      pump 36 pumps the desiccant 30 through a first heat exchanger 38
      prior to its introduction into the collection chamber 20. By
      cooling the desiccant 30, its ability to remove water from the
      first airflow 28 is increased. A fluid, such as a refrigerant, is
      passed through the heat exchanger 38 via conduits 40, 42. The
      desiccant 30 is cooled in the heat exchanger 38 to a temperature
      below that of the first airflow 28. In this way, the airflow 28 is
      cooled as it passes through the collection chamber 20. As an
      alternative to the heat exchanger 38, a heat exchanger may be
      placed inside the collection chamber 20 to cool the first airflow
      28 directly, or to cool the desiccant 30 after it is sprayed into
      the collection chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The regeneration chamber 22 also includes an inlet 44 and
      an outlet 46, which facilitate movement of a second airflow 48
      into and out of the regeneration chamber 22. In the embodiment
      shown in FIG. 1, the two chambers 20, 22 are conveniently disposed
      adjacent each other inside a housing 50. Between the two chambers
      20, 22 is a partition 52, which allows the hydrous desiccant from
      the collection chamber 20 to mix with desiccant in the
      regeneration chamber 22, and vice versa. Instead of the partition
      52, a valve or other flow control device may be used to control
      the flow of desiccant between the two chambers 20, 22. In the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the partition 52 allows for
      equalization in concentration of the desiccant 30 which is
      achieved through osmotic flow. Thus, the desiccant 30 in the
      collection chamber 20 is not rapidly diluted and rendered
      ineffective. In addition, a float (not shown) may be employed to
      operate in an opening 54 just below the partition 52. The float
      can be used to help measure the temperature differential between
      the two chambers 20, 22, and to control the degree of sensible
      heat transfer. By modifying the size of the opening 54, via a
      float or some other structure, it is possible to influence the
      degree of sensible heat transfer and further optimize the system
      10.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As with the collection chamber 20, the regeneration chamber
      22 also includes a pump 56 which is used to pump the desiccant 30
      into the regeneration chamber 22 through a conduit 58. The
      desiccant 30 is sprayed into the regeneration chamber 22 with an
      orientation that is generally perpendicular to at least a portion
      of the second airflow 48. This is similar to the arrangement in
      the collection chamber 20. By crossing the flow directions between
      the desiccant 30 and the first and second airflows 28, 48, contact
      between the air and the desiccant is increased, without generating
      the high pressure that might be associated with parallel flows.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As shown in FIG. 2, the desiccant 30 is pumped by the pump
      56 through a second heat exchanger 60. Heat can be added to the
      heat exchanger 60 from any convenient source, via conduits 62, 64.
      By passing through the heat exchanger 60, the desiccant 30 is
      heated to a temperature above the temperature of the second
      airflow 48, so that the second airflow 48 is heated as it passes
      through the regeneration chamber 22. By heating the second airflow
      48, more water is evaporated from the desiccant 30 into the second
      airflow 48. As an alternative to the heat exchanger 60, which is
      located outside the regeneration chamber 22, a heat exchanger 66,
      shown in phantom in FIG. 2, may be located inside the regeneration
      chamber 22. The heat exchanger 66 can be supplied with heat from
      any convenient source via conduits 68, 70.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In alternative embodiments, non-liquid desiccants can be
      used in a variety of configurations. In one example, a solid water
      absorbing material is used to absorb water from an incoming air
      stream and then subjected to a dry air stream that causes the
      transfer of water vapor from the solid water absorbing material to
      the dry air stream. The transfer may occur through a series of
      alternating cycling air streams, each of which may be warmed or
      cooled depending on what would best cause the transfer of water
      vapor. In another example, solid desiccants can be dispersed into
      an air trap that contacts incoming air streams. The desiccants
      absorb or adsorb water from the air. The trap is then exposed to a
      heating element, thereby causing the water to evaporate from the
      desiccant and regenerating the desiccant. The air containing the
      evaporated water is then exposed to a water extraction stage, as
      described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The humid air manufacturing stage 12 results in two
      separate airflows exiting the chambers 20, 22. The first airflow
      28 of now dry air exits the collection chamber 20 through the
      outlet 26, and the second airflow 48 of now humid air exits the
      regeneration chamber 22 through the outlet 46. The water
      extraction stage 14 includes a system heat exchanger 72. In the
      embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the heat exchanger 72 is configured to
      receive the cool dry airflow 28 and the warm humid airflow 48,
      such that heat is transferred between the two airflows 28, 48. In
      particular, heat will be transferred from the warmer airflow 48 to
      the cooler airflow 28, resulting in extraction of water 74 from
      the second airflow 48. As an alternative to using the first
      airflow 28 to cool the second airflow 48, another source of
      cooling, such as a refrigerant, may be passed through the heat
      exchanger 72 via conduits 76, 78.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the
      extraction of water from the first airflow 28 increases the latent
      heat of the desiccant 30, and results in latent cooling of the
      first airflow 28. Additionally, because the desiccant 30 (or
      alternatively the chamber 20, or both) is cooled, the first
      airflow 28 itself undergoes sensible cooling that lowers its
      temperature level, thereby creating cooled, dry air. In one
      embodiment, the present invention uses 10 liters of lithium
      chloride solution to extract 2 liters per hour of moisture from
      incoming air that is provided by an air blower rated at 250
      m&lt;3&gt; /hour. The result is a sensible cooling capacity of 0.7
      kW and a latent cooling capacity of 1.4 kW, thereby enabling a
      temperature reduction in the air of 8.4[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As shown in FIG. 3, the first and second airflows 28, 48
      are pulled through the heat exchanger 72 (and respectively through
      the chambers 20, 22) by a fan 80. The heat exchanger 72 is a
      radiator-type heat exchanger which includes a plurality of air
      tubes 82 through which the airflow 48 passes. As heat is
      transferred from the airflow 48 to the airflow 28, water 74
      condenses out of the airflow 48 and trickles down a header pipe
      84. The water 74 actuates a float valve 86 which may be configured
      to work by its own buoyant power or by a sensor. The water 74 then
      drops into a condensate collector 88 after being released by the
      float valve 86.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Once the water is extracted from the airflow 48 and
      collected in the condensate collector 88, it can be subject to a
      variety of filtration, purification, storage, and dispensing
      steps. As shown in FIG. 3, the water leaving the heat exchanger 72
      is then processed by a water treatment subsystem 89 at the water
      purification and filtration stage 16 and dispensed the water
      dispensing stage 18. The additional steps actually employed in
      these last two stages 16, 18 are dependent upon the type and
      nature of the application for which the water producing system 10
      is being used. For example, in one embodiment, the water
      purification and filtration stage 16 uses ceramic filters to
      remove water born pathogens. In addition, the ceramic filters can
      be filled with a high-grade silver activated carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Various grades of readily available activated carbons, such
      as Columbia, Pittsburgh, Barnebey-Cheney, Continental, Bone Char,
      Acticarbone, Cochranex, Carboraffin, by way of illustration and
      not limitation, can be used as the medium. Such carbons can be
      prepared from a variety of sources such as wood, bones, blood,
      carbohydrates, coal, coconut shells, corncobs and cornstalks,
      kelp, lignite, nutshells, oil shale, petroleum coke, rubber waste
      and sawdust. The activated carbon employed may be in various
      forms, for example it may be in granular, powdered or pelleted
      form or combined in preformed materials such as fibers, slurry,
      paper or other supporting media. Because of a high adsorption
      rate, granular carbons may be particularly effective. A mesh size
      of less than about 100 may be more effective than larger sizes,
      but larger sizes may be suitable where higher flow rates are
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In yet another alternative embodiment, a kinetic
      degradation fluxion (KDF) and carbon combination filter is used.
      This is similar to a granular activated carbon filter with
      additional metal removal capabilities, including lead. Chlorine is
      converted to chloride by the KDF portion, which is a zinc/copper
      composite. This extends the life of the carbon media bed. This
      type of filtration also helps to minimize biological activity.
      Additionally and/or alternatively, the present invention uses
      reverse osmosis, ion exchange demineralization, and/or ultra fine
      membrane filters as stand alone or in combinations.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Another embodiment of the present invention utilizes fabric
      filters having enhanced capabilities for removing contaminants
      from a fluid. The fabric filters utilized may be treated with an
      inorganic hydrolyzing composition such as sodium hydroxide. Such a
      filtration system, utilizing a cellulose acetate fiber filter,
      effectively removes microbiological flora. By utilizing such a
      system in conjunction with a virus filtration unit and a reverse
      osmosis membrane, a liquid such as water may be very highly
      purified. Media such as activated carbon, which are used for
      adsorbing viruses, are treated with inorganic sodium containing
      hydrolyzing composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] It may be desirable, however, to use a filtration system
      that is easily maintained, where the filters can be regenerated,
      and where the filters can be used without requiring frequent
      replacements. Additionally, numerous other filters can be used at
      different stages in the process, including UV filters, sediment
      filters, pre-carbon filters, post-carbon filters, and
      ultrafiltration cartridges.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Referring back to FIG. 3, one embodiment of the present
      invention includes an ultraviolet light unit 90. The UV light unit
      90 can be advantageously combined with a plurality of other
      filters to improve the quality of water. The UV unit 90 is
      designed so as to maximize the bacteria-killing effect of an
      optimal frequency of ultraviolet radiation. Accordingly, the
      interior surfaces of the unit 90 are coated with reflective
      material, and the unit 90 is shaped around a high-intensity, short
      wavelength ultraviolet lamp (not shown) so as to direct the liquid
      condensate into the optimum zone of bacteria destruction. The UV
      lamp may be changed by removal of the unit cap 92.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A pump 94, preferably self-priming, is activated according
      to the volume of water within the UV unit 90 by means of a lower
      sensor 96 and an upper sensor 98. The lower sensor 96 and upper
      sensor 98 are both electrically connected to a pump relay switch
      (not shown) that closes and allows power to the pump 94 when both
      the lower sensor 96 and the upper sensor 98 are immersed in water.
      The pump 94 provides pressure sufficient to pull water from the
      second end 99 of the UV unit 90, forcing water through a
      solid-core charcoal filter 100 and a mineralizing cartridge 102
      into a storage tank system 104. The pump 94, solid-core charcoal
      filter 100, mineralizing cartridge 102 for adding minerals to the
      purified water, and the storage tank 104 fluidly communicate via a
      conduit 106. A check valve 108, placed serially with respect to
      the pump 94 and UV unit 90, prevents reversal of water flow when
      the pump 94 is deactivated.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] To regulate the level of water in the storage tank 104, the
      cover of the storage tank 104 is provided with an overflow float
      switch that regulates the speed of, or disallows power to, the
      multi-speed fan 80, thereby stopping and/or reducing the rate of
      condensation at the dew-forming surfaces of the heat exchanger 72
      when the water level reaches the cover of the tank 104. In an
      alternate embodiment, where a heat exchanger, such as the heat
      exchanger 72, is cooled using typical refrigerant-expansion coils,
      power may be switched off to the refrigerant compressor (not
      shown) when the level of the water in the storage tank 104
      approaches the attached storage tank cover, thereby stopping water
      condensation.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the liquid condensate is
      additionally passed through an oxygenator 110 prior to
      introduction into the storage tank 104, in order to healthfully
      introduce oxygen into the water. This completes an initial, or
      first treatment of the water, which, as explained below, may be
      subject to a second and subsequent treatments by recirculation
      through at least a portion of the water treatment subsystem 89. A
      quick-disconnect tube 112 may additionally be attached to direct
      water from the storage tank 104into external containers. In one
      embodiment these external containers are large cisterns to store
      water for industrial, agricultural or commercial consumption. The
      water collected in the external containers can be further treated
      through chemical disinfectants such as chlorine, bromine, iodine,
      potassium permanganate, cooper and silver ions, alkalis, acids and
      ozone or any other suitable chemical agent known to persons of
      ordinary skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] To make the system 10 more desirable for office or home
      use, the system 10 is optionally fitted with subsystems for
      producing water at three temperatures-i.e., hot, cold and ambient.
      In one embodiment, water from the storage tank 104 is allowed to
      gravity feed through a self-sealing gasket and through a tube 114
      into a cold-water tank system 116. The water may then be chilled
      within the cold-water tank system 116 by a low-pressure evaporator
      refrigerant coil of a secondary heat absorber (not shown). Other
      heat absorber methods may alternatively be used to cool the water,
      such as Peltier-effect or chemical/magnetic cooling or any other
      effective method. The water may be further gravity dispensed
      outside by means of a spigot (not shown). Energy dissipation from
      cold-water tank 116 is decreased by insulation. Additionally, a
      securable tube 118 may be sealing connected to the cold-water tank
      116 to permit direct introduction of medicines and/or vitamins
      into the cold-water tank 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Water from the cold-water tank 116 further flows by gravity
      into a hot water tank system 120. The water may then be heated
      within the hot water tank system 120 by a heating element 122. The
      water is dispensed by means of another childproof spigot (not
      shown). The temperature of both hot and cold water is optionally
      displayed on a display panel. In one embodiment, ambient
      temperature water is dispensed from the hot water tank 120 via a
      spigot (not shown) when the heating element 122 is not provided
      with electrical power. In an alternate embodiment, ambient
      temperature water is dispensed directly from the storage tank 104
      via a separate spigot (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] To maintain its purity and freshness, water in the storage
      tank 104 may be recirculated on a periodic basis through at least
      some of the water treatment subsystem 89. For example, water from
      the tank 104 may be recirculated through the UV unit 90; however,
      in the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, the water is only recirculated
      through the filter 100, the mineralizer 102, and the oxygenator
      110. A solenoid valve 124, placed serially in fluid communication
      via conduit 126 between the storage tank 104 and the UV unit 90,
      prevents flow of water from the storage tank 104 to the UV unit 90
      unless electrical power is supplied to the solenoid valve 124.
      This prevents water in the storage tank 104 from draining if
      electrical power to the apparatus fails. Recirculation of the
      condensate is accomplished by activating a recirculation pump (not
      shown) at predetermined time intervals. By this repeated process,
      water is intermittently and continually recirculated across
      portions of the water treatment subsystem 89 whenever the water
      producing system 10 is in use. The flow duration may be defined by
      the volume circulated or by time. An indicator port (not shown) on
      the exterior of the UV unit 90 may be used to confirm proper
      operation of the UV unit 90.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In one embodiment, water can be collected from any or all
      of the tanks 104, 116 and/or 120 in an external container (not
      shown) wherein cartridges of medicines and/or vitamins can be
      advantageously inserted. This arrangement keeps the
      medicated-vitamin-supplemented water mass from being recirculated
      through the UV bacteriostat zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In the embodiment shown in FIG. 3, an external, secondary
      source of water 128, such a municipal water supply, supplies water
      to the storage tank 104 in the event of low water level in the
      tank 104. Accordingly, conduit 106 is fitted with a tee 130 to
      permit fluid communication with the external water source 128. A
      solenoid valve 132 is provided to prevent water from flowing
      through the external water source side of the tee 130 unless
      activated by an actuating electric power signal. At the external
      water source side of the solenoid valve 132, a female
      quick-disconnect fitting (not shown) is provided to permit easy
      coupling and uncoupling of external water source 128. The
      externally supplied water is passed through the tee 130 in the
      direction of the storage tank 104. A check valve (not shown) can
      be used to prevent water from flowing toward the UV unit 90.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The externally supplied water may be directed through a
      reverse-osmosis membrane filter 134, which in turn, simultaneously
      directs filtered water into storage tank 104 and wastewater
      through drain outlet into a drain for disposal (not shown). A
      solenoid valve 136 prevents external water from entering the
      membrane filter 134, unless activated by electrical signals from a
      low water sensor 138 provided at the inside bottom of the storage
      tank 104. If there is low water in the storage tank 104, an
      electrical signal is either sent to the pump 94, or if the
      apparatus is connected to an external water source such as the
      water source 128, the signal is sent to the inlet water solenoid
      136 to open it, thereby letting water pressurize the system.
      Optionally, a booster pump 140 is provided at the external water
      source end of the solenoid valve 136 to pump pressurized external
      water through a fluidly communicating sand/sediment filter and
      pre-filter 142, serially provided between the booster pump 140 and
      membrane filter 134, to remove heavy metals and VOC's from the
      external water.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b> -- A method and apparatus for removing moisture
      from within an electronics enclosure is provided. In particular,
      dehumidification is accomplished by removing air from the
      enclosure, cooling the air thereby causing condensation of water
      vapor from the air, then heating the dehumidified air and
      returning the heated and dehumidified air to the enclosure. A
      single heat pump provides cooling and heating functions,
      effectively recouping heat extracted from the air to be cooled,
      and transferring the extracted heat to the air prior to its return
      to the enclosure. In this manner, electronics within the enclosure
      may be operated at temperatures below the dew point of ambient air
      surrounding the enclosure, without requiring a thermally insulated
      enclosure. Devices are provided to collect and purge condensate
      from the system, either in a continuous or periodic manner.;
      Embodiments employing conventional vapor compression cycle heat
      pumps and thermoelectric heat pumps are described. A defrost cycle
      is provided to eliminate frost that may accumulate on the heat
      exchanger associated with the heat pump normally cold element.
      Defrost is accomplished by reversing heat pump polarity, heating
      the normally cold element. Control mechanisms and logic are
      provided to automate system operation. In preferred embodiments,
      dehumidification and defrost modes are activated by a controller
      monitoring the dew point within the enclosure, and the air
      pressure at the normally cold element. Dehumidification is
      performed intermittently, when the enclosure dew point exceeds a
      set point. Substantially sealing the enclosure against ingress of
      ambient air reduces the system's operational duty cycle.<br>
