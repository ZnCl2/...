      </b><b>Making ITC believable</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Today, some of us in ITC research believe it’s time to back up a
      bit and untangle the mess — to unboggle the minds that have been
      badly boggled. First, we have to develop an ITC system that
      provides convincing contacts under any conditions, in a mixed
      crowd. A number of us have been working on such systems. I’ve had
      some encouraging results in Colorado over the past year with a
      special subtle energy device called a "luminator." <br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="luminator-markmacy.jpg"
          height="310" width="321"><br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><i>The author and the "Luminator"</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The luminator is a tower-shaped device about four feet high (1.3
      meters), which radically alters the environment in an area that
      extends about 100 feet (30 meters) in all directions from the
      device. It has two internal fans which move air over a series of
      liquid-filled rings. As the air molecules go tumbling through the
      rings, unusual things happen to them, according to inventor
      Patrick Richards, including a reverse spin of electrons. (To get
      the inventor's own perspective on the luminator, its effects, and
      its use in non-ITC applications, please see
      www.biolumanetics.net.)<br>
      <br>
      When I take a picture of someone with a Polaroid camera in the
      presence of the luminator, there is a good chance that there will
      be other faces in the picture after it develops a few minutes
      later — faces of people who are not present physically — that is,
      faces of spirit beings...<br>
      <br>
      Today, the luminator offers a broader view of reality, and I
      believe that mainstream science is ripe for another overhaul. A
      few frontier scientists, such as Rupert Sheldrake in England,
      Burkhard Heim and Ernst Senkowski in Germany, and William Tiller
      in the United States, are talking about other dimensions of
      reality superimposed over our own, and the subtle energies and
      consciousness that can shape those realities. But mainstream
      scientists are not listening. Their conventional scientific model
      of reality is threatened by these new ideas, and so they are
      waiting for indisputable proof. <br>
      <br>
      I believe that the luminator images provide that proof, so I’ve
      given my luminator a designation: the GT-21. That is an
      abbreviation for "Galileo’s Telescope of the Twenty-First
      Century." My luminato r— the GT-2 1— provides a very basic and
      reliable ITC capability, allowing simple spirit pictures to be
      collected on Polaroid film in a mixed crowd.<br>
      <br>
      The most logical and reasonable conclusion to be drawn from these
      luminator images, in my opinion, is that the faces in the images,
      which are often strikingly clear, are the faces of actual people
      who are alive in realms beyond the range of our vision, but who
      can nevertheless be close to us and interact in our lives, and in
      the right circumstances can show themselves on Polaroid film.
      Other explanations, again in my opinion, (for example the notion
      that our thoughts are creating the faces, or that the faces are
      just photographic defects) are less reasonable and perhaps more
      contrived.<br>
      <br>
      Incidentally, we have tried various other forms of
      photography--35-mm cameras, digital cameras, VHS camcorders, and
      digital camcorders--but none of them have shown anomalous results
      during experiments in my lab, where only the Polaroid camera has
      provided spirit images in the presence of the luminator. (However,
      my colleagues Patrick Richards and Jack Stucki have told me that
      some anomalous effects have also been recorded at other
      locations&nbsp; on both 35-mm film and VHS recording tape.)<br>

      <div align="center"><b>Introduction to Bioliminal Photography</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Bioliminal photography* is the brain child of an American engineer
      called Patrick Richards and, as is the case with many inventions,
      its development was quite accidental. Patrick originally created
      an instrument (a Luminator) in order to balance air temperatures
      for more efficient heat energy management. However, when testing
      his technology in various offices he discovered that his machine
      (which incidentally looks rather like a large stereo speaker) not
      only created a more uniform temperature gradient but also that the
      workers started to report improvements in their health. It
      appeared to alter the magnetic field of the environment and also
      sensitive light meters indicated an increase in light emissions in
      the working area. Patrick then made further explorations using
      photography in the field. Photographs when taken in this altered
      field often produced anomalous images of the subjects – either
      fuzzy or with multiple images. After years of research, Patrick
      concluded that people suffering from health challenges usually
      produced fuzzy or distorted images when photographed while healthy
      individuals produced clear and “normal” photographs. A further
      development revealed that when subjects held a correct remedy or
      appropriate medicine for their condition were photographed within
      the field, totally clear images were obtained.<br>
      <br>
      * Bioliminal: Patrick Richards coined this term. Coming from the
      Greek – bios (life) and limen (the limit below which a stimulus is
      not perceived) to indicate the nature of this phenomenon.<br>

      ...In the coming weeks I plan to publish dozens of strange and
      intriguing photos I captured over a 12-year period. The pictures
      were made possible by combining Polaroid (instant photograph)
      technology with a subtle energy device called a “luminator.”<br>
      <br>
      I bought a luminator from Michigan inventor Patrick Richards in
      1999 and took thousands of pictures over the years… until 2010,
      after Polaroid stopped making its popular 600 film. I had friends,
      family, and clients pose in my lab, and I hauled the luminator
      around the country, taking pictures at conferences and seminars.<br>
      <br>
      The rings in the cylinder contain a water-based liquid that
      inventor Richards programmed with intention as he designed each
      luminator… the way one can program a crystal.<br>
      <br>
      The photos hint at the illusory nature of our physical world,
      which seems so solid and real to us… trapped as we are in the five
      senses. Somehow the luminator helps to break down the illusion, to
      give us a glimpse of the subtle realms that flourish beneath the
      surface of our dense reality.<br>
      <br>
      Basically I would photograph a subject while the luminator was
      whirring nearby, and as the picture developed over several
      minutes, strange anomalies would usually begin to appear.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes the photos were “normal,” showing the subject clearly.
      But more often than not, the developed picture would be hazy, with
      strange light streaks and other anomalies. Sometimes unusual faces
      emerged from the mist… and those were the pictures of greatest
      interest to me, as an afterlife researcher.<br>
      <br>
      ****<br>
      <br>
      The luminator is a tower-shaped device that houses two fans, one
      above and one below a plexiglass cylinder with liquid-filled rings
      mounted along its internal wall. The counter-rotating fans create
      a vortex, like a small tornado that swirls through the cylinder.
      The hardware and the vortex together open a portal that
      (apparently) allows the subtle realities around us to interact
      more directly with our dense material reality....<br>

      ...The luminator seems to melt away some of the barriers between
      the physical world and spirit worlds, allowing spirit friends to
      move in a bit more closely to get their images on film, and
      allowing other strange things to happen. The inventor of the
      luminator, Patrick Richards, tells a story of the time he placed
      three of the devices in a triangular configuration spanning two
      rooms in his house. He turned them on, sat in the center of the
      triangle formed by three devices, and felt a very strange
      sensation. As he leaned his head against the wall, it went THROUGH
      the wall as though it were passing through a light beam rather
      than a solid object. He quickly withdrew his head, turned off the
      luminators, and has not tried the experiment again since then. He
      says it was quite a frightening experience. Somehow the triangular
      configuration of the three devices seemed to have created a vortex
      to other dimensions, or at least it altered the molecular
      structure of things (the walls or the inventor’s body) in this
      world...<br>

      Patrick Richards the inventor/developer of the system describes it
      as the science of Life expressing as Light or briefly Life-Light.
      The word is taken from the term Bioluminescence that describes the
      electro-chemical action in a male firefly when it lights up.
      Numerous studies confirm that life-forms emit light.1 In
      Biolumanetics we believe that light is the primary/fundamental
      expression of life and that we are primarily energy beings with a
      physical dimension. In this article we will attempt to inform the
      reader of only the health aspect of this life discipline.<br>
      <br>
      The system was developed in the US by sixty two year old American
      engineer, Patrick Richards, who has worked with it for fourteen
      years. In 1983 he designed an instrument to balance air
      temperatures for efficient energy management. The device now
      called a Luminator™ did create a balanced air environment – but on
      further exploration turned out to have a more important and
      unexpected application.<br>
      <br>
      While testing the unit in open plan offices it was discovered that
      people working in the environment of the Luminator™ reported
      beneficial health changes ranging from loss of low back pain to
      reduction of stress and migraine headaches. The results, protocols
      and the methods and the markers of&nbsp; this unpublished study
      can be made available upon request.<br>
      <br>
      Searching for an explanation for the health changes he found that
      the Luminator™ altered the environment in three ways –
      temperatures were balanced floor to ceiling and wall to wall, an
      altered magnetic field was created, and the available light in the
      room was reorganised from normal incoherent light (light going in
      many directions) to coherent polarised light. There are several
      unpublished papers/studies on this work.<br>
      <br>
      In 1985 he discovered by accident, that the cell light from
      life-forms could be imaged in the field of the Luminator™. Late
      1985 found him imaging people holding their medications.<br>
      <br>
      As a researcher he has seen, tested and treated over a thousand
      individuals who have been referred to him because they did not
      respond to traditional approaches. He has seen the following
      types; bone and other tissue that would not heal, Diabetic ulcers
      and neuropathy, PMS/PMT, SAD, Chronic Fatigue or ME, environmental
      illnesses, degenerative problems associated with ageing, arthritis
      and hyperactivity in children, among other conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Working with these individuals, long term follow-ups show marked
      improvement to total loss of symptoms, without the client
      acquiring new symptoms. Case studies are available upon request
      to&nbsp; licensed practitioners&nbsp; with&nbsp; specific
      needs.&nbsp; At this point it is important to state that all the
      “diseases” described above were “diagnosed”&nbsp; by conventional
      health practitioners who have a different model of understanding.
      In Biolumanetics we do NOT “diagnose” “diseases” nor do we address
      symptoms directly. <br>
      <br>
      Biolumanetics is a complete assessment and healing system.
      Biolumanetics is the synthesis of many different approaches
      including acupuncture, homoeopathy, flower essences, gem elixirs,
      colour therapy, kinesiology, chelation and radionics. The result
      is a synergistic whole which is greater than the sum of its many
      parts. It is an integrated vast new model of understanding...<br>
      <br>
      <b>VRIC Imaging – The Assessment System</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      VRIC is an unique active imaging system for measuring vitality or
      coherence of any life form, human, animal or plant. VRIC
      (pronounced Veerick) stands for Visual Reference of Image
      Coherence. Organisms/life forms emit light. The brightness,
      intensity and the coherence of the light emitted is an indication
      of its health. We define health as vitality or coherence. A
      healthy person emits brighter, more intense light. In a life form
      suffering from dis-ease (we define disease as a loss of vitality)
      the level of light or photon emission from the cells is lowered.
      So far there has not been a means to see the level of cell-light
      being emitted by a life form, as a true physical image.<br>
      <br>
      To make a VRIC assessment we use two devices, a fixed focus
      Polaroid camera and a Luminator™. The Luminator™ creates a special
      environment in the room which makes it possible to use the VRIC
      assessment method. Up until now it has not been possible to know
      in advance with any degree of certainty, whether a particular
      medication/remedy/supplement/treatment would work for the
      client/patient’s benefit. It has also not been possible to verify
      in any objective manner, whether bioenergetic and “vibrational”
      forms of healing are “really” effective or not. VRIC is a
      milestone for all practitioners of subtle energy medicine and
      forms of healing. At last spiritual healing, homoeopathy, flower
      essences, acupuncture, shiatsu, reiki, colour therapy to name but
      a few, can be assessed in an objective manner. No longer can they
      be dismissed, as being totally subjective “placebo” effects
      existing only in the imagination of the patient because there was
      no “scientific” basis for drawing any conclusion...<br>
      <br>
      VRIC photos are taken in a special altered environment – the field
      of the LUMINATOR™.<br>
      <br>
      All VRIC photos are taken with a simple fixed focus Polaroid
      camera. The only modification to the camera is that we mask the
      flash. The film used is ordinary Polaroid 600 colour film.<br>
      <br>
      They are taken from the same distance and in the same lighting
      conditions.<br>

      <div align="center"><big><b>...How does the luminator work?</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      How do the vortex, the fans, the Plexiglass barrel and the
      liquid-filled rings of the luminator work together to allow
      nonphysical faces to appear on Polaroid film? I can only speculate
      at this time.<br>
      <br>
      First, an internet search for “vortex experiments” yields dozens
      of research projects underway in the world that are studying
      storms, climate modeling, formation of droplets, hydrodynamics,
      static electricity, multidimensional energy transference,
      anti-gravity, thrusters, sunspots, superconductors, magnetics,
      pure electron plasma, and ionic interactions. It’s evident, then,
      that vortices can have significant and varied effects on their
      surroundings. Assuming that most of these researchers are onto
      something, then it’s possible that the vortex formed by the fans
      in the luminator might have some influence upon the interaction
      between the physical and nonphysical realms and upon the entities
      inhabiting those realms.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the water-based liquid in the rings within the luminator are
      said to be programmed to certain frequencies, which might have
      some bearing on the resonant frequencies of the entities in
      nonphysical realms.<br>
      <br>
      As I mentioned, these are just speculations. Certain knowledge of
      how and why the luminator facilitates the faces is not known; nor
      is it necessary as long as we can accept that the nonphysical
      faces in the photos are genuine, and as long as we know that the
      luminator facilitates them. With that knowledge, we can answer
      other questions in the future, as we gain a better understanding
      of these nonphysical realms and how they interplay with our world.<br>
      <br>
      For now I can safely state that the luminator and the Polaroid
      process implemented in low-lighting conditions seem to be key
      factors. I’ve captured no nonphysical faces in photos that I’ve
      taken without the luminator present. And with the luminator
      running I have tried 35mm film, digital cameras, and various types
      of digital and analog video cameras, all without ever getting a
      nonphysical face in a picture. Only with a Polaroid camera with
      the luminator running do I get results.<br>
      <br>
      When using a Polaroid camera I mask the flash unit with black tape
      and score a hole in the tape the size of a sesame seed. That
      allows just a small flicker of light to escape during each
      exposure. Indoor lighting of overhead incandescence and
      fluorescence induce the best results. Sunlight and halogen
      lighting yield poor results...<br>
