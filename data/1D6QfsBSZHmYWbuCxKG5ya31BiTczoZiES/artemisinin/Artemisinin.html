      <div align="center"><b> </b><b>Wormwood and iron annihilate 98
          per cent of cancer cells in 16 hours</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Doctors and pharmaceutical companies reject the idea that diet and
      healthy lifestyle choices can lead to a cancer-free life and can
      prevent or delay the evolution of this deadly disease.<br>
      <br>
      According to a study published by Life Sciences, artemisinin, a
      derivate of the wormwood plant can kill 98 per cent of breast
      cancer cells in just 16 hours when paired with iron. On its own,
      the herb managed to reduce the breast cancer cells by 28 per cent,
      but when it joined forces with iron, normal cells were not
      affected by the treatment and had a better outcome.<br>
      <br>
      The problem with mainstream cancer treatment is that it attacks
      not only cancer cells, but also the healthy ones, making the road
      to recovery heavier and in some cases even impossible because an
      acidic system with a stagnant lymphatic system that stems from
      poor dietary and lifestyle choices allows the disease to thrive.
      However, the body can be quickly alkalized and flooded with
      nutrients when people consume a predominantly plant-based and
      unprocessed diet.<br>
      <br>
      Artemisinin has been used in the past as a tool against malaria,
      but new studies show it can fight against cancer too. In the study
      published by Life Sciences last year, when subjects were given an
      iron supplement, the artemisinin was able to target only “bad”
      cells and left the “good” ones untouched. Researchers’ results
      demonstrated that it “mediates the cell cycle arrest of human
      breast cancer cells and represents a critical transcriptional
      pathway by which artemisinin controls human reproductive cancer
      cell growth.”<br>
      <br>
      Scientists Narendra Singh and Henry Lai from the University of
      Washington made the initial discovery. Lai synthesized to compound
      to target only the diseased cells, which picked it up without
      knowing that there is a “bomb” (wormwood derivate) hidden inside.
      The compound is being licensed by the University of Washington to
      Artemisia Biomedical Inc., a company founded by Singh and Lai in
      Newcastle, Washington for development and commercialisation.<br>
      <br>
      According to the study’s abstract, “artemisinin reacts with iron
      to form free radicals that kill cells.” Previous studies have
      shown that the compound is “more toxic to cancer cells than to
      normal cells.”<br>
      <br>
      Tomikazu Sasaki, chemistry professor at University of Washington
      and senior author of the study which focuses on artemisinin’s
      anti-cancer benefits judged that “side effects are a major
      limitation to current chemotherapies.” Although the compound kills
      about 100 cancer cells for every healthy cell, the researchers
      added a small chemical tag to artemisinin which sticks to the
      “iron needed here” protein signal. The cancer cell waited for the
      protein machinery to deliver iron molecules and engulfed
      everything. As Lai described it, “the compound is like a little
      bomb-carrying monkey riding on the back of a Trojan horse.”<br>
      <br>
      During ancient times, wormwood was used to treat stomach
      disorders. Now, the herb is being used to bring down high
      temperature due to fever and can be applied directly to the skin
      to treat minor wounds, burns or insect bites.<br>

      The Department of Bioengineering and University of Washington do
      not advocate the use of artemisinin to treat cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The US Food and Drug Administration does not currently approve the
      use of artemisinin for the treatment of any disease.<br>
      <br>
      Research on artemisinin and cancer is still in very early stages.
      Human use of artemisinin should be considered experimental and
      taking artemisinin or any other drug should be approached with
      extreme caution and responsibility. Always consult with your

        <b> Methods of inhibition or killing cancer cells using an
          endoperoxide</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Inventor(s): LAI HENRY C [US]; SINGH NARENDRA <br>
      Methods of inhibiting or killing cancer cells are disclosed
      wherein compounds having an endoperoxide moiety that is reactive
      with heme are administered under conditions which enhance
      intracellular iron concentrations. Representative endoperoxide
      compounds include endoperoxide bearing sesquiterpene compounds
      such as artemisinin and its analogs, arteflene and its analogs,
      1,2,4-trioxanes and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes. Intracellular iron
      concentrations may be enhanced by the administration of iron salts
      or complexes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the inhibition or killing of
      cancer cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to
      the systemic and topical treatments of cancer cells with
      sesquiterpene compounds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Artemisinin (Qinghaosu) and its analogs are the treatments of
      choice for cerebral or chloroquine resistant malaria or for
      patients with chloroquine allergy. Artemisinin is a naturally
      occurring substance, obtained by purification from sweet wormwood,
      Artemisia annua L. Artemisinin and its analogs are sesquiterpene
      lactones with a peroxide bridge, and are characterized by very low
      toxicity and poor water solubility. Artemisinin is known as a
      humoral immunosuppressive agent which is less active than
      cyclophosphamide, the latter being one of the major
      chemotherapeutic agents for carcinomas. Artemisinin stimulates
      cell-mediated immunity, and yet decreases abnormally elevated
      levels of polyamine regulatory proteins. It also markedly inhibits
      nucleic acid and protein syntheses. Further, it affects cellular
      membrane functions and decreases hepatic cytochrome oxidase enzyme
      system activity. Still further, it is virustatic against influenza
      and cidal against three groups of pathogenic parasites.<br>
      <br>
      Known analogs of artemisinin which have higher solubility in water
      are dihydroartemisinin, artemether, artesunate, arteether,
      propylcarbonate dihydroartemisinin and artelinic acid.
      Dihydroartemisinin has an antimalarial potency which is 60% higher
      than that of artemisinin. Artemether and artesunate have
      antimalarial potencies which are 6 times and 5.2 times,
      respectively, that of artemisinin. In terms of their ability to
      inhibit nucleic acid synthesis, dihydroartemisinin, artemether,
      artesunate, arteether, and propylcarbonate dihydroartemisinin all
      have 100 times the activity of artemisinin, and protein synthesis
      is stimulated to an even greater extent by these compounds.
      Artesunate stimulates the immune system at low doses and inhibits
      it at high doses. Artelinic acid is the most water-soluble and the
      most stable of the group. Two of the compounds in this group have
      been demonstrated to display synergistic activity with doxorubicin
      (a chemotherapeutic agent) and miconazole (an antifungal agent) in
      the in vitro killing of Plasmodium falciparum, the etiologic agent
      of malaria.<br>
      <br>
      The very low toxicity of these compounds to humans is a major
      benefit. Artesunate, for example, is twice as safe as artemether
      and only one-fiftieth as toxic as chloroquinine, the most common
      antimalarial. The first manifestation of toxicity of these
      compounds is generally a decreased reticulocyte count. Other
      manifestations include transient fever, decreased appetite and
      elevated blood transaminase levels, the latter an indication of
      hepatotoxicity.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,676 discloses the use of artemisinin and
      artemisinin analogs in the treatment of skin conditions such as
      psoriasis, blistering skin diseases, viral warts, and hemorrhoids.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,978,676 discloses the use of combinations
      artemisinin and artemisinin analogs with monocarboxylic acids,
      esters or amides in the treatment of papulosquamous skin diseases,
      including psoriasis, an eczematous skin diseases, including
      seborrheic and atopic dermatitis.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,880 discloses the use of artemisinin and
      artemisinin analogs in the treatment of warts, molluscum
      contagiosum and hemorrhoids.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,225,427 discloses certain 10-substituted ether
      derivatives of dihydroartemisinin alleged to exhibit antimalarial
      and antiprotozoal activity.<br>
      <br>
      Artemisinin alone has been shown to be toxic to cancer cells in
      vitro at 20 to 180 .mu.M range (Sun et al., "Antitumor Activities
      of 4 Derivatives of Artemisic Acid and Artemisinin B in vitro,"
      Chung-Kuo-Yao-Li-Hsueh-Pao 13:541-543 (1992)). The effect was
      found to be more effective for hepatoma and embryonic lung cells
      than against human gastric cancer cells. In another study
      (Woerdenbag et al., "Cytotoxicity of Artimisinin-related
      Endoperoxides to Erlich Ascites Tumor Cells," J. Nat. Prod.
      56(6):849-856 (1993)), artemisinin was shown to have an IC50 value
      of 29.8 .mu.M on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Several derivatives
      of dihydroartemisinin (artemether, arteether, sodium artesunate,
      artelinic acid, and sodium artelinate) had IC50 values ranged from
      12.2 to 19.9 .mu.M. A ether dimer of dihydroartemisinin was found
      to have an IC50 of 1.4 .mu.M. However, the toxicity of the dimer
      to normal cells was not tested. The authors of the latter paper
      concluded that, "The artemisinin-related endoperoxides showed
      cytotoxicity to Ehrlich ascites tumor cells at higher
      concentrations than those needed for in vitro antimalarial
      activity, as reported in the literature." However, serum
      concentrations at the levels reported by the two papers cannot be
      reached in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      Artemisinin is a relatively safe drug with little side-effects
      even at high doses. Oral dose of 70 mg/kg/day for 6 days has been
      used in humans for malaria treatment. Furthermore, more potent
      analogs of this and similar compounds are also available. Higher
      efficacy of artemisinin action also can be achieved by other
      means. For example, artemisinin is more reactive with heme than
      free iron (Hong, et al. "The Interaction of Artemisinin with
      Malarial Hemozoin," Mol. Biochem. Parasit. 63:121-128 (1974)).
      Heme can be introduced into cells using transferrin (Stout, D. L.,
      "The Role of Transferrin in Heme Transport," Biochim. Biophy. Res.
      Comm. 189:765-770 (1992)) or the heme-carrying compound hemoplexin
      (Smith et al., "Expression of Haemopexin-Transport System in
      Cultured Mouse Hepatoma Cells," Biochem. J. 256:941-950 (1988);
      Smith et al., "Hemopexin Joins Transferrin as Representative
      Members of a Distinct Class of Receptor-Mediated Endocytic
      Transport System," Europ. J. Cell Biol. 53:234-245 (1990)). The
      effectiveness of artemisinin also can be enhanced by increasing
      oxygen tension, decreasing intake of antioxidants, and blockade of
      peroxidase and catalase by drugs such as miconazole (Meshnick et
      al., "Activated Oxygen Mediates the Antimalarial Activity of
      Qinghaosu," Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 313:95-104 (1989); Krungkrai et
      al., "The Antimalarial Action on Plasmodium falciparum of
      Qinghaosu and Artesunate in Combination with Agents Which Modulate
      Oxidant Stress," Tran. Roy. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 81:710-714
      (1989); Levander et al., "Qinghaosu, Dietary Vitamin E, Selenium,
      and Cod Liver Oil: Effect on the Susceptibility of Mice to the
      Malarial Parasite Plasmodium yoelii," Am. J. Clin. Ntr. 50:346-352
      (1989)).<br>
      <br>
      The endoperoxide moiety of artemisinin and its analogs has been
      found to be necessary for antimalarial activity, and analogs
      lacking this group have been found to be inactive. In the presence
      of heme, the endoperoxide bridge undergoes reductive decomposition
      to form a free radical and electrophilic intermediates.
      Accordingly, endoperoxide bearing compounds other than artemisinin
      and its analogs have been found to have antimalarial activity. For
      example, arteflene (Ro. 42-1611; Biirgen et al., "Ro. 42-1611, A
      New Effective Antimalarial: Chemical Structure and Biological
      Activity," Sixth International Congress for Infectious Diseases,
      Abst. 427, p. 152, April 1994, Prague), and the 1,2,4-trioxanes,
      such as the fenozans (Peters et al., "The Chemotherapy of Rodent
      Malaria. XLIX. The Activities of Some Synthetic 1,2,4-Trioxanes
      Against Chloroquinine-Sensitive and Chloroquinine-Resistant
      Parasites. Part 2: Structure-Activity Studies on cis-fused
      Cyclopenteno-1,2,4-Trioxane (Fenozans) Against Drug-Sensitive and
      Drug-Resistant Lines of Plasmodium berghei and P. yoelii spp. NS
      In Vivo," Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, 87(1):9-16
      (1993)), and the 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes (Vennerstrom et al.,
      "Dispiro-1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes: A New Class of Antimalarial
      Peroxides," J. of Medicinal Chemistry, 35( 16):3023-3027 (1992)).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It has been discovered that the anticancer activity of compounds
      having an endoperoxide moiety that is reactive with heme and iron,
      of which artemisinin and its analogs, arteflene and its analogs,
      1,2,4-trioxanes and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes are representative
      examples, is substantially enhanced both in vitro and in vivo when
      administered under conditions which enhance intracellular iron
      concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the endoperoxide bearing
      compounds have a sesquiterpene structure, particularly an
      oxygenated tricyclic sesquiterpene structure with an endoperoxide
      group, and preferably those which are sesquiterpene lactones or
      alcohols, carbonates, esters, ethers and sulfonates thereof.
      Examples of such compounds include artemisinin;
      dihydroartemisinin; carbonate, sulfonate, ester and ether
      derivatives of dihydroartemisinin, notably artemether, arteether,
      artesunate and artesunate salts, and dihydroartemisinin propyl
      carbonate; and the bis-ether artelinic acid.<br>
      <br>
      Iron agents useful for enhancing intracellular iron concentrations
      in connection with the practice of the invention include
      pharmaceutically acceptable iron salts and iron complexes.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the sesquiterpene compounds and the iron enhancing
      agents, compositions of the present invention may further comprise
      the administration of conventionally used antineoplastic agents,
      such as androgen inhibitors, antiestrogens, cytotoxic agents,
      hormones, nitrogen mustard derivatives, steroids and the like, as
      a means of further enhancing clinical efficacy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      The foregoing aspects and many of the attendant advantages of this
      invention will become more readily appreciated as the same becomes
      better understood by reference to the following detailed

      addition of dihydroartemisinin. Cell counts were done at 8 hours
      after addition of dihydroartemisinin. Each bar represents the
      average from four experiments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, it has been discovered
      that the ability to kill cancer cells of compounds having an
      endoperoxide moiety that is reactive with heme and iron,
      particularly artemisinin and artemisinin analogs, arteflene and
      its analogs, 1,2,4-trioxanes and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes, can be
      significantly enhanced by increasing the iron concentration in the
      body of a patient, such as by the administration of iron salts or
      complexes, followed by administration of the endoperoxide
      compound. Analogs of artemisinin, in general molecules containing
      sesquiterpene lactone with a peroxide, arteflene and its analogs,
      1,2,4-trioxanes and 1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes are particularly preferred
      for this purpose. Both iron salts or complexes and the
      endoperoxide compound can be administered orally. It is presently
      particularly preferred that iron salt or complex be administered
      before the endoperoxide compounds such that cancer cells will be
      preloaded with iron to induce free radical formation with the
      endoperoxide compound.<br>
      <br>
      Transferrin is an endogenous protein which transports iron and
      heme from the circulation into cells. Transferrin binds to
      transferrin receptors on cell surface, and via endocytosis is
      taken inside the cell and iron is then released. Most cancer cells
      express higher cell surface concentration of transferrin receptors
      than normal cells and have high rates of iron influx via
      transferrin receptors, because iron is needed in cell growth and
      division. For example, human hepatoma cells can express 800,000
      transferrin receptors per cell on the cell surface, whereas normal
      lymphocytes generally express no transferrin receptors. The entire
      population of transferrin receptors on a mouse teratocarcinoma
      stem cell can be internalized within 6 min.<br>
      <br>
      An artemisinin molecule, as a representative endoperoxide compound
      of the invention, is a sesquiterpene lactone containing an
      endoperoxide bridge that can be catalyzed by iron to form free
      radicals. Its antimalarial action is due to its reaction with-the
      iron in free heme molecules in malaria parasite with the
      generation of free radicals leading to cellular destruction. The
      present invention takes advantage of this property of artemisinin
      and targets it towards cancer cells. This selectivity in action is
      because cancer cells have higher concentration of transferrin
      receptors on their cell membrane and pick up iron at a higher rate
      than normal cells. In the presence of artemisinin, increase in
      iron concentration inside cancer cells will lead to free radical
      formation intracellularly and cell death.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the present invention, a human or animal
      patient is treated by enhancing the iron concentration in
      extracellular fluids in the patient and administering to the
      patient a compound comprising an endoperoxide group that is
      reactive with heme or iron.<br>
      <br>
      In connection with the present invention, compounds may be
      employed, in general, that possess an endoperoxide group that
      reacts in the presence of heme to form free radicals.
      Representative, presently preferred endoperoxide compounds are set
      forth herein, although it will be apparent that other endoperoxide
      compounds will be useful for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred endoperoxide bearing sesquiterpene compounds of the
      present comprise compounds of the formula: ##STR1## wherein R is
      ##STR2## where R1 is hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl, or has the
      formula: ##STR3## wherein R2 is alkyl or aryl and n is 1 to 6, and
      the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used herein, the
      term "alkyl" means lower alkyl having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms,
      preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Alkyl groups of the invention may
      be straight-chain or branched-chain groups, with straight-chain
      groups preferred. The term "aryl" preferably refers to phenyl and
      benzyl, with phenyl the most preferred. Pharmaceutically
      acceptable salts include the alkali or alkaline earth metal salts,
      preferably sodium or potassium, with sodium the most preferred.<br>
      <br>
      The presently particularly preferred sesquiterpene compounds of
      the invention include artemisinin, where R is ##STR4##
      dihydroartemisinin (R1 .dbd.--OH), artesunic acid (R1
      .dbd.--OCO(CH2)2 CO2 H), and artesunate, artemether (R1
      .dbd.--OCH3) and arteether (R1 .dbd.--OC2 H5). The presently most
      particularly preferred sesquiterpene compound of the invention is
      dihydroartemisinin.<br>
      <br>
      Other representative endoperoxide compounds of the invention
      include arteflene (Ro. 42-1611) and its analogs (Biirgen et al.,
      supra), 1,2,4-trioxanes (Peters et al., supra) and
      1,2,4,5-tetraoxanes (Vennerstrom et al., supra).<br>
      <br>
      Preferred agents for enhancing intracellular iron levels for use
      in combination with the sesquiterpenes of the present invention
      include pharmaceutically acceptable iron salts and iron complexes.
      Iron salts useful in the practice of the invention include ferrous
      fumarate, ferrous sulfate, ferrous carbonate, ferrous citrate,
      ferrous gluconate and ferrous lactate. Iron complexes useful in
      the practice of the invention generally include pharmaceutically
      acceptable complexes comprising iron, such as, for example,
      ferrocholinate, ferroglycine sulfate, dextran iron complex,
      peptonized iron, iron sorbitex, ferric oxide and saccharated iron,
      as well as iron complexed with iron binding proteins and
      glycoproteins, such as the holoferritins and holotransferrins.<br>
      <br>
      The concentrations of the endoperoxide compounds in the
      formulations to be applied in the practice of the present
      invention will generally range up to the maximally tolerated
      dosage, but the concentrations are not critical and may vary
      widely. For artemisinin and its analogs, however, best results
      will be obtained using formulations containing the compounds at
      levels of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg per kilogram of body
      weight per day, preferably from about 1 to about 90 mg per
      kilogram of body weight per day, and most preferably from about 1
      to about 75 mg per kilogram of body weight per day. The precise
      amounts employed by the attending physician will vary, of course,
      depending on the compound, route of administration, physical
      condition of the patent and other factors. The daily dosage may be
      administered as a single dosage or may be divided into multiple
      doses for administration. The amount of the compound actually
      administered for treatment will be a therapeutically effective
      amount, which term is used herein to denote the amount needed to
      produce a substantial clinical improvement. Optimal amounts will
      vary with the method of administration, and will generally be in
      accordance with the amounts of conventional medicaments
      administered in the same or a similar form. Topical or oral
      administration, for instance, may typically be done from once to
      three times a day.<br>
      <br>
      The concentrations of agents for enhancing intracellular iron
      concentrations in the practice of the present invention will
      generally range up to the maximally tolerated dose for a
      particular subject and agent, which will vary depending on the
      agent, subject, disease condition and other factors. Dosages
      ranging from about 1 to about 100 mg of iron per kilogram of
      subject body weight per day will generally be useful for this
      purpose.<br>
      <br>
      This procedure will be most effective for the treatment of
      aggressive cancer, in which large number of transferrin receptors
      are expressed on the cell surface. However, the procedure may not
      be effective in the treatment of certain types of cancer. For
      example, some adult T-cell leukemia have defective internalization
      of transferrin receptors and may not be susceptible to this
      treatment. (Vidal et al., "Human T Lymphocyte Virus I Infection
      Deregulates Surface Expression of the Transferrin Receptors," J.
      Immunol. 141:984-988 (1988)) Furthermore, this procedure can be
      used in prophylactic cancer prevention, prevention of cancer
      recurrence and metastases after surgery, and as an adjuvant of
      other traditional cancer therapy.<br>
      <br>
      More potent and water soluble analogs of artemisinin and similar
      compounds, e.g., dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artether, and
      artemether, etc., are available. Higher efficacy of artemisinin
      action also can be achieved by other means. For example,
      artemisinin is more reactive with heme than free iron. Heme can be
      introduced into cells using transferrin or the heme-carrying
      compound hemoplexin. The effectiveness of artemisinin also can be
      enhanced by increasing oxygen tension, decreasing intake of
      antioxidants, and blockade of peroxidase and catalase by drugs
      such as miconazole.<br>
      <br>
      The topical formulations may further include one or more of the
      wide variety of agents known to be effective as skin or stratum
      corneum penetration enhancers. Examples of these are
      2-pyrrolidone, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethylacetamide,
      dimethylformamide, propylene glycol, methyl or isopropyl alcohol,
      dimethyl sulfoxide, and azone. Additional agents may further be
      included to make the formulation cosmetically acceptable. Examples
      of these are fats, waxes, oils, dyes, fragrances, preservatives,
      stabilizers, and surface active agents. Keratolytic agents such as
      those known in the art may also be included. Examples are
      salicylic acid and sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      The amounts of each of these various types of additives will be
      readily apparent to those skilled in the art, optimal amounts
      being the same as in other, known formulations designed for the
      same type of administration. Stratum corneum penetration
      enhancers, for example, will typically be included at levels
      within the range of about 0.1% to about 15%.<br>
      <br>
      The optimal systemic formulation of the basic combination of the
      present invention, i.e., the combination of sesquiterpene lactone
      with an intracellular iron enhancing agent, may vary from one such
      combination to the next.<br>
      <br>
      The formulations of the present invention may further include as
      optional ingredients one or more agents already known for their
      use in the inhibition of cancer cells, for added clinical
      efficacy. Such combinations will in some cases provide added
      benefit. These agents include, for example, androgen inhibitors,
      such as flutamide and luprolide, antiestrogens, such as tomoxifen,
      antimetabolites and cytotoxic agents, such as daunorubicin,
      fluorouracil, floxuridine, interferon alpha, methotrexate,
      plicamycin, mecaptopurine, thioguanine, adriamycin, carmustine,
      lomustine, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,
      estramustine, altretamine, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, procarbazine,
      mutamycin, busulfan, mitoxantrone, carboplatin, cisplatin,
      streptozocin, bleomycin, dactinomycin and idamycin, hormones, such
      as medroxyprogesterone, estramustine, ethinyl estradiol,
      estradiol, leuprolide, megestrol, octreotide, diethylstilbestrol,
      chlorotrianisene, etoposide, podophyllotoxin and goserelin,
      nitrogen mustard derivatives, such as melphalan, chlorambucil,
      methlorethamine and thiotepa, steroids, such as betamethasone, and
      other antineoplastic agents, such as live Mycobacterium bovis,
      dicarbazine, asparaginase, leucovorin, mitotane, vincristine,
      vinblastine and taxotere. Appropriate amounts in each case will
      vary with the particular agent, and will be either readily known
      to those skilled in the art or readily determinable by routine
      experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      The endoperoxide compounds and iron agents of the invention may be
      employed in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo for killing of target cancer
      cells. For in vivo applications, compositions of the endoperoxide
      compounds of the invention generally comprise an amount of the
      endoperoxide compounds effective, when administered to a human or
      other animal subject, to localize a sufficient amount of the
      endoperoxide compounds at target tissue sites to facilitate target
      cell killing, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
      Any pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may be generally used for
      this purpose, provided that the carrier does not significantly
      interfere with the stability or bioavailability of the
      sesquiterpene compounds of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions of the invention can be administered in any
      effective pharmaceutically acceptable form to warm blooded
      animals, including human and other animal subjects, e.g., in
      topical, lavage, oral, suppository, parenteral, or infusable
      dosage forms, as a topical, buccal, or nasal spray or in any other
      manner effective to deliver the agents to a site of target cells.
      The route of administration will preferably be designed to
      optimize delivery and localization of the agents to the target
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      For topical applications, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
      may take the form of liquids, creams, lotions, or gels, and may
      additionally comprise organic solvents, emulsifiers, gelling
      agents, moisturizers, stabilizers, surfactants, wetting agents,
      preservatives, time release agents, and minor amounts of
      humectants, sequestering agents, dyes, perfumes, and other
      components commonly employed in pharmaceutical compositions for
      topical administration.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions designed for injection may comprise pharmaceutically
      acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, suspensions or
      emulsions. Examples of suitable nonaqueous carriers, diluents,
      solvents, or vehicles include propylene glycol, polyethylene
      glycol, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, and injectable organic
      esters such as ethyl oleate. Such compositions may also comprise
      adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispensing
      agents. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through
      a bacteria-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing
      agents into the compositions. They can also be manufactured in the
      form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or
      suspended in sterile water, saline, or other injectable medium
      prior to administration.<br>
      <br>
      Solid dosage forms for oral or topical administration include
      capsules, tablets, pills, suppositories, powders, and granules. In
      solid dosage forms, the compositions may be admixed with at least
      one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose, or starch, and may
      additionally comprise lubricating agents, buffering agents,
      enteric coatings, and other components well known to those skilled
      in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Actual dosage levels of the compositions of the invention may be
      varied so as to obtain amounts of the sesquiterpene compound and
      iron at the site of target cells, especially tumor cells,
      effective to obtain the desired therapeutic or prophylactic or
      diagnostic response. Accordingly, the selected dosage level will
      depend on the nature and site of the target cells, the desired
      quantity of sesquiterpene compound and iron required at the target
      cells for target cell inhibition or killing purposes, the nature
      of the sesquiterpene compound and iron agent employed, the route
      of administration, and other factors. Generally, for oral delivery
      routes of administration, effective administration doses will
      include from about 1 to about 100 mg/kg of iron containing agent,
      more preferably from about 10 to about 90 mg/kg of iron containing
      agent per kilogram of body weight of the subject per day, and from
      about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg of an endoperoxide compound of the
      invention, more preferably from about 1 to about 90 mg/kg of the
      endoperoxide compound per kilogram of body weight of the subject
      per day. The foregoing doses may be administered as a single dose
      or may be divided into multiple doses for administration, e.g., up
      to three times per day.<br>

      </b><b> EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> In Vitro Cancer Cell Inhibition</b><br>
      <br>
      Molt-4-lymphoblastoid cells and human lymphocytes were used in the
      experiment. Molt-4-lymph cells were purchased from the American
      Type Culture Collection (Rockville, Md.). They are acute
      lympoblastic leukemia cells from human peripheral blood. Cultures
      were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Gibco, Long Island, N.Y.)
      supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, New Haven,
      Conn.). Cells were cultured at 37 DEG C. in 5% CO2 /95% air and
      100% humidity, and were split 1:2 at a concentration of
      approximately 1.times.10@6 /ml. Approximate cell number before
      experiment were between 150.times.10@3 to 300.times.10@3 per ml.
      Human lymphocytes were isolated from fresh blood obtained from a
      healthy donor and isolated using a modification of the
      Ficoll-hypaque centrifugation method of Boyum, A., "Isolation of
      Mononuclear Cells and Granulocytes from Human Blood," Scand. Clin.
      Lab. Invest. 21:77-89 (1968). In this method, 20-100 .mu.l of
      whole blood obtained from a finger prick was mixed with 0.5 ml of
      ice-cold RPMI-1640 without phenol red (GIBCO, N.Y.) in a 1.5 ml
      heparinized microfuge tube (Kew Scientific Inc., Columbus, Ohio).
      Using a Pipetman, 100 .mu.l of cold lymphocyte separation medium
      (LSM) was layered at the bottom of the tube. The samples were
      centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 2 min in a microfuge (Sorvall,
      Microspin model 245) at room temperature. The lymphocytes in the
      upper portion of the Ficoll layer were pipetted out. Cells were
      washed twice in 0.5 ml RPMI-1640 by centrifugation for 2 min at
      3500 rpm in the microfuge. The final pellet consisting of
      approximately 0.4-2.0.times.10@5 lymphocytes was resuspended in
      RPMI-1640. Cell viability was determined before experiments using
      trypan blue exclusion and found to be more than 95%.<br>
      <br>
      Cells (Molt-4 and lymphocytes) were aliquoted in 0.1 ml volumes
      into microfuge tubes. Human holotransferrin (Sigma Chemicals, St.
      Louis, Mo.) was added to samples of the cells. Different
      concentrations of freshly prepared dihydroartemisinin dissolved in
      complete medium were added 1 hr later to the tubes. The final
      concentration of holotransferrin was 12 .mu.M and
      dihydroartemisinin was either 1, 10, 50, or 200 .mu.M. Equal
      volume of medium was added to control samples (i.e., samples
      without holotransferrin nor dihydroartemisinin). Cells were kept
      in an incubator at 37 DEG C. under 5% CO2 and 95% air during the
      experiment. At 1, 2, 4, and 8 hrs after the addition of
      dihydroartemisinin, the cell number was counted from a 10 .mu.l
      aliquot from the samples using a hemocytometer. The cells were
      thoroughly mixed by repeated pipeting before an aliquot was taken
      for counting. In the case of Molt-4 cells, cell viability was not
      determined because it is not correlated with cell loss as rapid
      cell disintegration was observed.<br>
      <br>
      Data are expressed as percentage of cell count at a certain time
      point compared to cell count at the time when dihydroartemisinin
      was added (time zero in FIGS. 1 and 2). Time-response curves were
      compared by the method of Krauth, J., "Nonparametric Analysis of
      Response Curves," J. Neurosci. Method 2:239-252 (1980). The level
      of the curves, i.e., ao of the orthogonal polynomial coefficient,
      were compared with the median test. .chi.@2 was calculated with
      Yates's correction for continuity. The difference between two data
      points was also compared by the median test. A difference at
      p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. The Probit
      analysis was used to determine LD50 s, i.e., the concentration of
      dihydroartemisinin that causes a decrease in cell count by 50% in
      8 hrs, from the dose-response data.<br>
      <br>
      The percent cell count at different times after the addition of
      200 .mu.M of dihydroartemisinin of Molt-4 cells and lymphocytes
      are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, respectively. In both Molt-4 and
      lymphocytes, no significant difference in cell counts was observed
      between control samples and samples exposed to holotransferrin (12
      .mu.M) alone (.chi.@2 =0.5, df=1, non-significant) during the 8-hr
      incubation period. Compared to controls, a significant decrease in
      cell count (FIG. 1) was observed in Molt-4 cells exposed to
      dihydroartemisinin alone (.chi.@2 =4.5, df=1, p&lt;0.035 compared
      to control), and a combination of dihydroartemisinin and
      holotransferrin (.chi.@2 =4.5, df=1, p&lt;0.035 compared to
      control). In addition, percent cell counts of the combined drug
      treatment were significantly less than those treated with
      dihydroartemisinin alone (.chi.@2 =4.5, df=1, p&lt;0.035 compared
      to control).<br>
      <br>
      In the case of lymphocytes, exposure to dihydroartemisinin alone
      or dihydroartemisinin plus holotransferrin, cell counts were
      significantly less than those of the controls (.chi.@2 =4.5, df=1,
      p&lt;0.035 compared to control). However, the addition of
      holotransferrin did not significantly further enhance the effect
      of dihydroartemisinin alone (.chi.@2 =0.5, df=1, no significant
      difference between the dihydroartemisinin alone and
      holotransferrin+dihydroartemisinin response curves).<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3A and 3B show the dose-response relationship of
      dihydroartemisinin for Molt-4 and lymphocytes, respectively,
      incubated in 12 .mu.M of holotransferrin. The percent cell counts
      from samples at 8 hrs after addition of various concentrations of
      dihydrotransferrin is presented. Dose-dependent decreases in cell
      counts were observed. For Molt-4 cells, a significant difference
      (from control samples, .chi.@2 =4.5, df=1, p&lt;0.035) was
      observed at 1 .mu.M of dihydroartemisinin and higher. Smaller
      decreases in cell counts were observed with lymphocytes under
      similar treatment conditions. A significant difference from
      control samples was observed only at a concentration of
      dihydroartemisinin of 50 .mu.M and higher. Probit analysis of the
      data showed that the LD50 s for Molt-4 cells and lymphocytes were
      2.59 and 230 .mu.M, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing results demonstrate that combined incubation in
      holotransferrin and dihydroartemisinin can selectively destroy
      human cancer cells, whereas the effect is significantly less on
      normal lymphocytes. Artemisinin alone has been shown to be toxic
      to cancer cells in vitro at 20 to 180 .mu.M range (Sun et al.,
      supra). The effect was found to be more effective for hepatoma and
      embryonic lung cells than against human gastric cancer cells.
      However, serum concentrations at these levels cannot be reached in
      vivo. Addition of holotransferrin increases the potency and
      selectivity of the drug and may decrease the time of cell killing.
      In the combined treatment, considerable cell death was observed at
      a concentration of dihydroartemisinin of 1 .mu.M after 8 hrs of
      incubation. Furthermore, there is reason to believe that
      artemisinin can work at lower concentrations in vivo than in
      vitro. Culture medium may contain 19-30 .mu.M of free iron and
      could cause destruction of dihydroartemisinin molecules before
      they can gain entry into cells.<br>

      was given in three settings of five days each, with an interval
      between each treatment period of three to five days. The ferrous
      sulfate was administered six hours before artemisinin
      administration. The diameter size of inguinal and submandibular,
      right and left lymph nodes was reduced to half within five days of
      treatment. A reduction in size was observed in prescapular and
      popliteal lymph nodes. The diameter of all lymph nodes increased
      within two weeks of cessation of therapy. The dog survived for
      five months after treatment and then was euthanised.<br>

          cancer effectively too, say experts</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      Medical experts say a common malaria drug could have a significant
      impact on colorectal cancer providing a cheap adjunct to current
      expensive chemotherapy.<br>
      <br>
      A pilot study by researchers at St George's, University of London,
      has found the drug artesunate, which is a widely used anti-malaria
      medicine, had a promising effect on reducing the multiplication of
      tumour cells in colorectal cancer patients who were already going
      to have their cancer surgically removed.<br>
      <br>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) makes up about 10 percent of the annual
      746,000 global cancer cases in men and 614,000 cases in women.<br>
      <br>
      In the UK, 110 new cases are diagnosed daily, with older patients
      particularly at risk of death. Prognosis even with the best
      available treatments does not increase disease free or overall
      survival beyond 60 percent, five years after diagnosis.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Sanjeev Krishna, an infectious disease expert at St
      George's who jointly-led the study, said: "There is therefore a
      continuing and urgent need to develop new, cheap, orally effective
      and safe colorectal cancer treatments.<br>
      <br>
      "Our approach in this study was to take a close look at an
      existing drug that already had some anticancer properties in
      experimental settings, and to assess its safety and efficacy in
      patients.<br>
      <br>
      "The results have been more than encouraging and can offer hopes
      of finding effective treatment options that are cheaper in the
      future."<br>
      <br>
      "Larger clinical studies with artesunate that aim to provide well
      tolerated and convenient anticancer regimens should be implemented
      with urgency, and may provide an intervention where none is
      currently available, as well as synergistic benefits with current
      treatment regimens," added Professor Devinder Kumar, a leading
      expert in colorectal cancer at St George's and joint-lead of this
      study.<br>
      <br>
      For most patients globally, access to advanced treatments is
      difficult as they are too expensive to be widely available, or
      associated with significant morbidity thereby further compromising
      their survival.<br>
      <br>
      "In the St George's study, patients were examined and then were
      given either the anti-malaria drug artesunate or a placebo. After
      42 months following surgery, there were six recurrences of cancer
      in the placebo group (of 12 patients) and one recurrence in an
      artesunate recipient (of 10 patients).The survival beyond two
      years in the artesunate group was estimated at 91% whilst
      surviving the first recurrence of cancer in the placebo group was
      only 57%.<br>
      <br>
      This is the first randomized, double blind study to test the
      anti-CRC properties of oral artesunate. The anticancer properties
      of artemisinins have been seen in the laboratory previously but
      this is the first time their effect has been seen in patients in a
      rigorously designed study.<br>

      </b><b> Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Background</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Artesunate is an antimalarial agent with broad anti-cancer
      activity in in vitro and animal experiments and case reports.
      Artesunate has not been studied in rigorous clinical trials for
      anticancer effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aim</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      To determine the anticancer effect and tolerability of oral
      artesunate in colorectal cancer (CRC).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      This was a single centre, randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. Patients planned for curative resection
      of biopsy confirmed single primary site CRC were randomised
      (n = 23) by computer-generated code supplied in opaque envelopes
      to receive preoperatively either 14 daily doses of oral artesunate
      (200 mg; n = 12) or placebo (n = 11). The primary outcome measure
      was the proportion of tumour cells undergoing apoptosis
      (significant if &gt;7% showed Tunel staining). Secondary
      immunohistochemical outcomes assessed these tumour markers: VEGF,
      EGFR, c-MYC, CD31, Ki67 and p53, and clinical responses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Findings</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      20 patients (artesunate = 9, placebo = 11) completed the trial per
      protocol. Randomization groups were comparable clinically and for
      tumour characteristics. Apoptosis in &gt;7% of cells was seen in
      67% and 55% of patients in artesunate and placebo groups,
      respectively. Using Bayesian analysis, the probabilities of an
      artesunate treatment effect reducing Ki67 and increasing CD31
      expression were 0.89 and 0.79, respectively. During a median
      follow up of 42 months 1 patient in the artesunate and 6 patients
      in the placebo group developed recurrent CRC.<br>
      Interpretation<br>
      <br>
      Artesunate has anti-proliferative properties in CRC and is
      generally well tolerated.<br>

      Artemisinin, also known as qinghaosu (Chinese: 青蒿素), and its
      semi-synthetic derivatives are a group of drugs that possess the
      most rapid action of all current drugs against Plasmodium
      falciparum malaria.[1] It was discovered by Tu Youyou, a Chinese
      scientist, who was awarded half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in
      Medicine for her discovery.[2] Treatments containing an
      artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies, ACTs)
      are now standard treatment worldwide for P. falciparum malaria.
      Artemisinin is isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, sweet
      wormwood, an herb employed in Chinese traditional medicine. A
      precursor compound can be produced using genetically engineered
      yeast.<br>
      <br>
      Chemically, artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone containing an
      unusual peroxide bridge. This peroxide is believed to be
      responsible for the drug's mechanism of action. Few other natural
      compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known.[3]<br>
      <br>
      Artemisinin and its endoperoxides derivatives have been used for
      the treatment of P. falciparum related infections but low
      bioavaibility, poor pharmacokinetic properties and high cost of
      the drugs are a major drawback of their use.[4] Use of the drug by
      itself as a monotherapy is explicitly discouraged by the World
      Health Organization,[5] as there have been signs that malarial
      parasites are developing resistance to the drug. Therapies that
      combine artemisinin or its derivatives with some other
      antimalarial drug are the preferred treatment for malaria and are
      both effective and well tolerated in patients. The drug is also
      increasingly being used in Plasmodium vivax malaria,[6] as well as
      being a topic of research in cancer treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medical use</b><b><br>
      </b><b> Uncomplicated malaria</b><br>
      <br>
      Artemisinins can be used alone, but this leads to a high rate of
      recrudescence (return of parasites) and other drugs are required
      to clear the body of all parasites and prevent recurrence. The
      World Health Organization (WHO) is pressuring manufacturers to
      stop making the uncompounded drug available to the medical
      community at large, aware of the catastrophe that would result if
      the malaria parasite developed resistance to artemisinins.[7]<br>
      <br>
      The WHO has recommended artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) be
      the first-line therapy for P. falciparum malaria worldwide.[8]
      Combinations are effective because the artemisinin component kills
      the majority of parasites at the start of the treatment, while the
      more slowly eliminated partner drug clears the remaining
      parasites.[9]<br>
      <br>
      Several fixed-dose ACTs are now available containing an
      artemisinin component and a partner drug which has a long
      half-life, such as mefloquine (ASMQ[10]), lumefantrine (Coartem),
      amodiaquine (ASAQ), piperaquine (Duo-Cotecxin), and pyronaridine
      (Pyramax). Increasingly, these combinations are being made to GMP
      standard. A separate issue concerns the quality of some
      artemisinin-containing products being sold in Africa and Southeast
      Asia.[11][12]<br>
      <br>
      Artemisinins are not used for malaria prophylaxis (prevention)
      because of the extremely short activity (half-life) of the drug.
      To be effective, it would have to be administered multiple times
      each day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Severe malaria</b><br>
      <br>
      Artesunate administered by intravenous or intramuscular injection
      has proven superior to quinine in large, randomised controlled
      trials in both adults [13] and children.[14] Combining all trials
      comparing these two drugs, artesunate is associated with a
      mortality rate that is approximately 30% lower than that of
      quinine.[14] Reasons for this difference include reduced incidence
      of hypoglycaemia, easier administration and more rapid action
      against circulating and sequestered parasites. Artesunate is now
      recommended by the WHO for treatment of all cases of severe
      malaria. Effective treatment with ACT (Artemisinin Combination
      Therapy) has proven to lower the morbidity and mortality from
      malaria within two years by around 70%.[15]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cancer treatment</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Artemisinin is undergoing early research and testing for the
      treatment of cancer.[16] Artemisinin has anticancer effects in
      experimental models of hepatocellular carcinoma.[17] Artemisinin
      has a peroxide lactone group in its structure, and it is thought
      that when the peroxide comes into contact with high iron
      concentrations (common in cancerous cells), the molecule becomes
      unstable and releases reactive oxygen species. It has been shown
      to reduce angiogenesis and the expression of vascular endothelial
      growth factor in some tissue cultures. Recent pharmacological
      evidence demonstrates the artemisinin derivative
      dihydroartemisinin targets human metastatic melanoma cells in
      vitro with induction of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced
      protein 1 dependent mitochondrial apoptosis that occurs downstream
      of iron-dependent generation of cytotoxic oxidative stress.[18] A
      pilot study on the use of the artemisinin derivative artesunate
      yielded promising results for the treatment of colorectal cancer
      [19]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Helminth parasites</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      A serendipitous discovery was made in China while searching for
      novel anthelmintics for schistosomiasis that artemisinin was
      effective against schistosomes, the human blood flukes, which are
      the second-most prevalent parasitic infections, after malaria.
      Artemisinin and its derivatives are all potent anthelmintics.[20]
      Artemisinins were later found to possess a broad spectrum of
      activity against a wide range of trematodes, including Schistosoma
      japonicum, S. mansoni, S. haematobium, Clonorchis sinensis,
      Fasciola hepatica, and Opisthorchis viverrini. Clinical trials
      were also successfully conducted in Africa among patients with
      schistosomiasis.[21] A randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial also revealed the efficacy against
      schistosome infection in Côte d'Ivoire[22] and China.[23]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adverse effects</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Artemisinins are generally well tolerated at the doses used to
      treat malaria.[24] The side effects from the artemisinin class of
      medications are similar to the symptoms of malaria: nausea,
      vomiting, anorexia, and dizziness. Mild blood abnormalities have
      also been noted. A rare but serious adverse effect is allergic
      reaction.[24][25] One case of significant liver inflammation has
      been reported in association with prolonged use of a relatively
      high-dose of artemisinin for an unclear reason (the patient did
      not have malaria).[26] The drugs used in combination therapies can
      contribute to the adverse effects experienced by those undergoing
      treatment. Adverse effects in patients with acute P. falciparum
      malaria treated with artemisinin derivatives tend to be
      higher.[27]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Resistance</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Clinical evidence for artemisinin resistance in southeast Asia was
      first reported in 2008,[28] and was subsequently confirmed by a
      detailed study from western Cambodia.[29][30] Resistance in
      neighbouring Thailand was reported in 2012,[31] and in Northern
      Cambodia, Vietnam and Eastern Myanmar in 2014.[32][33] Emerging
      resistance was reported in Southern Laos, central Myanmar and
      North-Eastern Cambodia in 2014.[32][33] The parasite's kelch gene
      on chromosome 13 appears to be a reliable molecular marker for
      clinical resistance in southeast Asia.[34]<br>
      <br>
      In April 2011, the WHO stated that resistance to the most
      effective antimalarial drug, artemisinin, could unravel national
      (India) malaria control programs, which have achieved significant
      progress in the last decade. WHO advocates the rational use of
      antimalarial drugs and acknowledges the crucial role of community
      health workers in reducing malaria in the region.[35]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mechanism of action</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Most artemisinins used today are prodrugs of the biologically
      active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, which is active during the
      stage when the parasite is located inside red blood cells.
      Although there is no consensus regarding the mechanism of action
      through which artemisinin derivatives kill the parasites,[36][37]
      several lines of evidence indicate that artemisinins exert their
      antimalarial action by radical formation that depends on their
      endoperoxide bridge. When the parasite that causes malaria infects
      a red blood cell, it consumes hemoglobin within its digestive
      vacuole, a process that generates oxidative stress.[38] In the
      primary theory of the mechanism of action, the iron of the heme
      directly reduces the peroxide bond in artemisinin, generating
      high-valent iron-oxo species and resulting in a cascade of
      reactions that produce reactive oxygen radicals which damage the
      parasite and lead to its death.[39] However, this mechanism has
      been debated and other hypotheses have been described.[40] One
      alternative is that artemisinins disrupt cellular redox
      cycling.[41] Artesunate has been shown to potently inhibit the
      essential Plasmodium falciparum exported protein 1 (EXP1), a
      membrane glutathione S-transferase.[42] Recently Shandilya et al.
      suggested a free radical mechanism in which artemisinin gets
      activated by iron present in the food vacuole which in turn
      inhibits PfATP6 by closing the phosphorylation, nucleotide
      binding, and actuator domains leading to loss of function of
      PfATP6 of the parasite and its death.[43]<br>
      <br>
      Numerous studies have investigated the type of damage oxygen
      radicals may induce. For example, Pandey et al. have observed
      inhibition of digestive vacuole cysteine protease activity of
      malarial parasites by artemisinin.[44] These observations were
      supported by ex vivo experiments showing accumulation of
      hemoglobin in the parasites treated with artemisinin and
      inhibition of hemozoin formation by malaria parasites, although
      this inhibition was not seen in an in vitro B-hematin inhibition
      assay.[45] Electron microscopic evidence linking artemisinin
      action to the parasite's digestive vacuole has been obtained
      showing that the digestive vacuole membrane suffers damage soon
      after parasites are exposed to artemisinin.[46] This would also be
      consistent with data showing that the digestive vacuole is already
      established by the mid-ring stage of the parasite's blood
      cycle,[47] a stage that is sensitive to artemisinins but not other
      antimalarials. However, fluorescently tagged artemisinin was seen
      in the Golgi, ER and mitochondria, rather than the digestive
      vacuole, suggesting that the vacuolar damage may be a downstream
      effect, and also that tiny ring stages (containing minimal
      digested material) are highly susceptible to
      artemisinins.[48][49][50]<br>
      <br>
      Other suggested targets include the mitochondrial electron
      transport chain [51] and the parasite's SERCA pump
      (PfATP6/PfSERCA).[52] Evidence to support the PfATP6 hypothesis
      includes studies reporting specific interactions between SERCAs
      and artemisinins,[52][53] undertaken in a Xenopus oocyte system
      that generated valuable results despite the challenges of working
      with low amounts of heterologous expressed material.[54] These
      findings have subsequently been confirmed in an independent series
      of experiments that use yeast expressing this calcium ATPase.
      Artemisinins selectively and reproducibly inhibit the yeast growth
      by their actions on PfATP6.[55] This methodology also provided
      information on the effects of mutations in PfATP6 on drug
      sensitivity.[53] In French Guiana and Senegal reduced sensitivity
      to artemisinins have been associated with single nucleotide
      polymorphisms in PfATP6.[56] In Tanzania, a significant increase
      in a predicted but previously undiscovered polymorphism in PfATP6
      has been found after a period of artemisinin combination
      therapy.[57] The mammalian calcium ATPase SERCA1a was also
      inhibited by artemisinins in coupled enzyme assays,[58] and
      mutations in either SERCA1a or PfATP6 modulate their sensitivity
      to artemisinin.[53] Anomalously, if either PfATP6 or SERCA1a are
      detergent solubilised, they do not show sensitivity to
      artemisinins.[59][60][61]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dosing</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Artemisinin derivatives have half-lives on the order of an hour.
      Therefore, they require at least daily dosing over several days.
      For example, the WHO-approved adult dose of co-artemether
      (artemether-lumefantrine) is four tablets at 0, 8, 24, 36, 48, and
      60 hours (six doses).[62][63]<br>
      <br>
      Artemisinin is not soluble in water, therefore Artemisia annua tea
      is postulated not to contain pharmacologically significant amounts
      of artemesinin.[64] Artemisia tea is therefore not recommended as
      a substitute for the ACTs; however, clinical studies have been
      suggested.[65]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Production and price</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      China and Vietnam provide 70% and East Africa 20% of the raw plant
      material. Seedlings are grown in nurseries and then transplanted
      into fields. It takes about 8 months for them to reach full size.
      The plants are harvested, the leaves are dried and sent to
      facilities where the artemisinin is extracted using solvent,
      typically hexane. Alternative extraction methods have been
      proposed.[66] The market price for artemisinin has fluctuated
      widely, between $120 and $1200 per kilogram from 2005 to 2008.[67]<br>
      <br>
      The Chinese company Artepharm created a combination artimisinin
      and piperaquine drug marketed as Artequick.[68] In addition to
      clinical studies performed in China and southeast Asia, Artequick
      was used in large scale malaria eradication efforts in the Comoros
      Islands. Those efforts, conducted in 2007, 2012, and 2013–2014,
      produced a 95–97% reduction in the number of malaria cases in the
      Comoros Islands.[69]<br>
      <br>
      After negotiation with the WHO, Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis
      provide ACT drugs at cost on a nonprofit basis; however, these
      drugs are still more expensive than other malaria treatments.[70]
      Artesunate injection for severe malaria treatment is made by the
      Guilin Factory in China where production has received WHO
      prequalification,[71] an indicator of drug quality.<br>
      <br>
      High-yield varieties of Artemisia are being produced by the Centre
      for Novel Agricultural Products at the University of York using
      molecular breeding techniques.[67]<br>
      <br>
      Using seed supplied by Action for Natural Medicine (ANAMED), the
      World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) has developed a hybrid, dubbed
      A3, which can grow to a height of 3 m and produce 20 times more
      artemisinin than wild varieties. In northwestern Mozambique, ICRAF
      is working together with a medical organisation, Médecins sans
      frontières, ANAMED and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
      Development to train farmers on how to grow the shrub from
      cuttings, and to harvest and dry the leaves to make artemisia tea.<br>
      <br>
      In April 2013, Sanofi announced the launch[72] of a production
      facility in Garessio, Italy, to manufacture the anti-plasmodial
      drug on a large scale. The partnership to create a new
      pharmaceutical manufacturing process was led by PATH’s Drug
      Development program (through an affiliation with OneWorld Health),
      with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and
      based on a modified biosynthetic process for artemisinic acid,
      initially designed by Jay Keasling at the University of
      California, Berkeley and optimized by Amyris. The reaction is
      followed by a photochemical process creating singlet oxygen to
      obtain the end product. Sanofi expects to produce 25 tons of
      artemisinin in 2013, ramping up the production to 55–60 tons in
      2014. The price per kg will be $350–400, roughly the same as the
      botanical source.[73] Despite concerns that this equivalent source
      would lead to the demise of companies, which produce this
      substance conventionally through extraction of A. annua biomass,
      an increased supply of this drug will likely produce lower prices
      and therefore increase the availability for ACTs treatment. In
      August 2014, Sanofi announced the release of the first batch of
      semisynthetic artemisinin. 1.7 million doses of Sanofi's
      ArteSunate AmodiaQuine Winthrop (ASAQ Winthrop), a fixed-dose
      artemisinin-based combination therapy will be shipped to half a
      dozen African countries over the next few months.[74]...<br>

        <b> Sweet wormwood herb brewed liquid, brewing technology
          thereof, and preparation method of starter thereof</b><br>
      </div>
      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ZHIFEN BEI, ET AL.<br>
      The invention relates to sweet wormwood herb brewed liquid, which
      is a pure brewed liquid brewed with a modified ancient traditional
      fermentation technology and with sweet wormwood herb and glutinous
      rice as raw materials. A main effective component of sweet
      wormwood herb, artemisinin, exists in plant cell glands, and is
      not soluble in water. Currently, both organic solvent extraction
      and chemical synthesis are disadvantaged in complicated
      technology, high cost and a problem of toxicity. According to the
      invention, a multi-strain starter which has both functions of
      saccharification and fermentation, a rice feeding method, and a
      composite fermentation technology are adopted. The technology is
      characterized in that: the temperature during the whole brewing
      process is controlled below 35 DEG C; a fermentation period is
      long (above 90 days); and prepared sweet wormwood herb medicinal
      brewed liquid contains various nutrients and complete effective
      components in sweet wormwood herb. As a result of cytotoxic tests
      upon breast cancer cells and lung cancer cells, the cells can be
      completely killed within 20h. The brewed liquid is taken by more
      than 20 people. It is found that the brewed liquid has certain
      ideal effects against some stubborn diseases, and no toxic or side
      effect is found.<br>
