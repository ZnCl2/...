      John Weston stands next to his 1992 Geo Storm GSI, which is
      equipped with his invention dubbed the Air Vapor Flow System. He
      claims the car can run 14 miles on 4 ounces of fuel, which means
      it runs with extreme fuel efficiency at more than 400 miles per
      gallon.<br>

      John Weston’s 1992 Geo Storm: “Since I changed the fuel system
      unit, it’s drastically different. I disconnected the fuel line
      from the injector so no liquid goes to the engine,” said Weston.
      Weston showed NBC-2 a version of his air vapor flow system where
      instead of liquid fuel, only vapors go to the engine. [ "run your
      car on vapors" ] “They used to say, ‘Hey I’m running on empty. I’m
      running on fumes.’ Well, this is actually running on fumes,” he
      said. Weston says the system burns cleaner and also made a bold
      claim about fuel efficiency from a one-time test. “It came up to
      463 miles a gallon if we had driven in the same manner – a
      gallon,” said Weston. <br>
      <br>
      “I drove from here to Fort Myers, and I’m up there keeping up with
      traffic running 80 mph. ” Now, the backyard mechanic is looking
      for investors so he can eventually take his invention public. In
      the meantime, he says you might see his car on the highway.” He
      also put his vaporizer on a generator, a riding lawnmower, and his
      motorcycle. which are all so much more “fuel efficient” now!<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The NBC reporters were even taken on a test drive, where the
      engine stumbled a little bit and John said he put too much vapor
      on the pipe, so when he lowered the vapors, everything got back to
      normal. <br>
      <br>
      NBC-2 relates that John Weston is waiting for investors, because
      he wants to sell his invention so the whole world benefits from
      it. . . . <br>
      <br>
      “I learned that when using the AVFS [Air &amp; Vapor Flow System]
      on my Geo Storm by using the standard 87 octane gasoline, then 89
      octane, then used Coleman fuel(for lanterns), then charcoal
      lighter fluid and even rubbing alcohol. On each of the different
      fuels there was a different setting of the “air/vapor” mixture for
      the engine to run smoothly. Not only at idle, but on acceleration
      as well. I did NOT change timing or bypass any of the original
      sensors that are factory installed on our vehicles now-a-days.” –
      John Weston<br>
      <br>
      “Based on talks with actual engineers that work at Ford and GM,
      these two companies have actively discouraged any improvements in
      fuel efficiencies. Engineers would be threatened if they were
      caught tinkering with the computer systems or searching for ways
      to make the car engines run more efficiently.” <br>
      <div align="center"><br>
      </div>
      Maybe if enough people offered to pay him to install one on their
      vehicle (boat? … around Port Charlotte) he could actually make
      some money from it, and if there is a self-serve-garage
      “rent-a-bay” in Port Charlotte you/he can rent for a few hours.<br>

      Notice the white container with about a half inch of gasoline in
      the bottom and an extra pipe with a valve to allow him to adjust
      the amount of extra air (to control the air/vapor mixture).<br>
      <br>
      It can also be seen the the air filter was in the area now
      occupied by his vapor system. Running without an air filter may be
      o.k. for a while – certainly long enough to do a few test drives
      and measure the rate of fuel consumption, but in the long run, an
      air filter will be needed. (see our “Run Your Car On Vapors” page)<br>

      If John Weston of Port Charlotte can get investors to take his
      gas-saving invention to the global automotive market, it just
      might solve the problems of smog, global warming and the high cost
      of foreign oil. It also might prove that human potential is not
      limited by education or socioeconomic status.<br>
      <br>
      Weston, 48, who dropped out of high school as a 10th-grader but
      later achieved a GED, claims to have invented a device that can
      turn virtually any car into a gas-miser that can run as far as 500
      miles on a single gallon.<br>
      <br>
      Called the Air Vapor Flow System, or AVFS, the device functions by
      vaporizing gasoline before it gets inducted into the engine. That
      saves fuel and reduces pollution because it allows the engine to
      burn more of the fuel that gets sucked into the combustion
      chamber, he contends. The device works on small, industrial
      engines or larger automobile engines regardless of whether they
      have carburetors or fuel injection systems, according to Weston.<br>
      <br>
      Weston has been working to bring a prototype of the invention into
      more advanced development since the late 1990s. After encountering
      some financial difficulties in recent months, Weston is now
      renewing efforts to find investors.<br>
      <br>
      “My setback has always been financial,” Weston said. “That’s why
      I’m totally open to sponsors, investors or purchasers.”<br>
      <br>
      The device consists of a small, plastic tank that gets mounted
      under the hood of a car. Some hoses from the engine’s air intake
      housing are run to the top of the tank so that the engine draws in
      vapors from above the level of the liquid gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      In an impromptu demonstration conducted for this reporter last
      week, Weston installed one of the devices into his battered 1992
      Geo Storm. Weston’s car ran well on the vapors from the device
      when the level of the liquid in the tank was within a certain
      margin. The engine ran either too rich or too lean when the level
      was above or below that margin. The car traveled 14.8 miles on
      about 4 ounces of gasoline during the test. If accurate, that
      would amount to about 473 miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      Weston’s neighbor, retired construction contractor William “Pops”
      Gavel, said he witnessed an even more dramatic experiment
      conducted by Weston. Gavel said he rode as passenger in Weston’s
      car for 28.7 miles — from Weston’s house to a location in
      Englewood — on just 4 ounces of Coleman camping fuel, or white
      gas. If accurate, that rate would be equivalent to 918 miles per
      gallon. Gavel said he watched Weston pour the 4 ounces into the
      tank and checked the mileage on the odometer himself.<br>
      <br>
      “I couldn’t believe it,” said Gavel. “I said, ‘Wire me up!’ I’ve
      got a Ford V-8 whacking down a gallon every 17 miles and I
      thought, gee, I could drive all day with that kind of mileage.”<br>
      <br>
      To operate the engine, once the fuel level dropped below its
      optimal margin, Weston briefly triggered a home-made switch 15
      times. That pumped in additional fuel from his car’s regular fuel
      tank. The switch was made from a lamp cord. It was triggered by
      pushing the two prongs of the plug together for a split second.
      After the test, <br>
      <br>
      Weston estimated the amount of gasoline consumed by measuring the
      amount of gasoline that was added from his car’s regular fuel
      tank. To do that, he again triggered the homemade switch 15 times,
      this time pumping fuel into a measuring cup. The fuel measured 4
      ounces.<br>
      <br>
      “Right now, it’s looking like a Mickey-Mouse backyard setup, but
      regardless of the way it looks, it functions,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      *** John Weston and his generator with his AVFS<br>
      <br>
      Also yet to be perfected are ways to maintain the level of liquid
      fuel in the vapor tank, and a way to adjust the mix of air and
      vapor while driving.<br>
      <br>
      Weston recently tested one of his AVFS tanks on a gasoline-powered
      utility generator. Without the device, the generator ran for 3.5
      hours. With the device, it ran for 14 hours on the same amount of
      fuel, he said. [a 400% improvement]<br>
      <br>
      <b>School of hard knocks</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Hailing from Connersville, Ind., Weston attended 23 schools in 10
      grades before dropping out. He explained his father, a
      construction worker, moved the family often, in both Indiana and
      Florida. “I could not afford to take vehicles in to get repaired,”
      he recalled. “I could afford only to buy a Chilton’s manual and
      repair them myself.”<br>
      <br>
      After working as a welder on oil rigs off Louisiana, he returned
      to Indiana to care for his ailing mother.<br>
      <br>
      The breakthrough came after Weston, who routinely smokes
      cigarettes while working on his engines, needed to peer into the
      gas tank of a lawn mower engine. It was dark in the tank.<br>
      <br>
      “I didn’t have a flashlight at the time, so I used a lighter,” he
      recalled.<br>
      <br>
      Suddenly, a blast of flame blew out of the tank. Weston
      immediately realized the potential.<br>
      <br>
      “I said, ‘Wow, let me try this,’” he said.<br>
      <br>
      Weston grabbed a piece of tailpipe and stuck one into a carburetor
      and the other into a five-gallon gas can. The engine ran for a few
      moments on the vapors from the can, he said.<br>
      <br>
      In 1996, a school teacher in his hometown invested $12,000 to help
      Weston fashion a working prototype. The teacher, Edward Slaybaugh
      of Connserville, Ind., said he considered the invention “the
      greatest boon this century.” “I hope some good comes of it,”
      Slaybaugh said Friday.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reg Tech Inc.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1997, Weston sold the rights to his invention to Reg Tech Inc.
      and its subsidiary, Regi U.S., of British Columbia, Canada.<br>
      <br>
      Slaybaugh said he was compensated for his investment with Reg Tech
      stock, which he still holds. The company is currently working to
      develop a lightweight rotary engine.<br>
      <br>
      Weston’s deal called for the two Canadian firms to pay him
      $100,000 cash, $400,000 in stock, plus royalties. If the companies
      never turned the device into a commercial product, the company
      would still have to pay Weston $24,000 per year for 21 years under
      the contract.<br>
      <br>
      The company had the AVFS tested on a small engine by the firm
      Adiabatics Inc. in Columbus, Ind. The results showed it reduced
      hydrocarbons 71 percent and carbon monoxide 25 percent. The rate
      of fuel consumption was reduced by 15 percent to 30 percent. But
      the device increased emissions of carbon dioxide 12 percent and
      nitrogen oxides 296 percent. Those are greenhouse and smog
      pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      Weston said those emissions increased because Reg Tech’s engineer
      failed to properly adjust the vapor/air mixture. “Not all
      engineers are mechanics,” Weston said.<br>
      <br>
      In 2002, Reg Tech relinquished the rights to the invention back to
      him.<br>
      <br>
      John Robertson, Reg Tech president, said in a phone interview last
      month the company’s patent attorney had advised the firm that
      Weston’s invention was “unpatentable” because it was “not unique.”
      Apparently, a similar system may have been used in race cars in
      years past, Robertson said.<br>
      <br>
      The company dropped the invention because it would have been
      unwise to invest in it without the protection of a patent,
      Robertson said.<br>
      <br>
      “It runs, but somebody’s got to have a sophisticated testing
      apparatus to develop it,” he added. <br>

      “The automotive industry has made strides in the past 10 years to
      make cars that produce less of such smog gases as hydrocarbons,
      carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, said Jim Kliesch, senior
      analyst for clean vehicles at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
      [no, they have fought long and hard, in the courts and in
      Washington, against making any improvements!]<br>
      <br>
      If a vaporization device such as Weston’s improved mileage to the
      levels that Weston claims, that would reduce gases contributing to
      global warming, said Kliesch. [an open recognition that Reg Tech's
      testing through Adiabatics must have been flawed when claiming an

      <div align="center"><b>THE AVFS</b><br>
      </div>
      Hi,<br>
      <br>
      My name is John Weston, the inventor of a fuel system called the
      Air/Vapor Flow System, referred to as AVFS, and would like to
      present this to everyone who is into automotive, energy saving
      systems, environment and new ideas that are a benefit to our
      society. Not to mention our economy, since the AVFS has been
      proven to get 14.8 miles on 4oz of 87octane gasoline, witnessed by
      Mr. Greg Martin, a reporter for the Charlotte Sun-Herald of Port
      Charlotte Florida.<br>
      <br>
      I developed the AVFS to operate an engine on the gasoline vapors
      which eliminates liquid gasoline from going to the engine. This
      does away with any unburned fuel in the exhaust (meaning no need
      for the EGR system) and reduces the emissions by up to 70% and
      possibly even more now (since I am doing further R&amp;D).<br>
      <br>
      With the reporter riding along with me when he was doing the story
      on the AVFS in the local news paper, we were able to drive 14.8
      miles on 4 oz. of liquid gasoline going to the AVFS tank that I
      had developed and adapted to the 1992 GEO Storm GSI, using the
      simple materials I was able to afford at the time, being some pvc
      tubing and fittings, some electrical conduit tubing and a plastic
      tank that was actually manufactured to be a tank for windshield
      washer fluid. That added up to be about 460 miles of driving if we
      had gone through a gallon of gasoline during the ride for proving
      that the AVFS does actually work and was being witnessed by the
      reporter so he would be able to be honestly writing a true story.<br>
      <br>
      My reason, hopes and desires for presenting the AVFS in this
      manner is that perhaps someone would be willing to either come
      here or have me brought to his/her facility or business,
      regardless of small or large selection of automobiles or equipment
      operated by gasoline engines, and give someone the opportunity to
      see it function in person, on any vehicle chosen to have the AVFS
      adapted to, the aspects of the AVFS and perhaps present it or
      assist financially as a means of helping get the AVFS in use for
      the sake of our environment, economy, energy savings and ability
      to stop buying so much oil from out of our country....<br>
      <br>
      I did file a patent registration on it before presenting it to
      others. Plus, being a certified paralegal helped to put together
      several other AGREEMENTS that are signed before others are shown
      the whole working of the AVFS. I am hoping this will reach some
      people who will be able and interested in sponsoring or investing
      soon. <br>
      <br>
      Hate to say, but am at a financial stand still currently and open
      for sponsorship(s) from $10.00 and up. Even small amounts help in
      big ways.<br>
      <br>
      Sincerely,<br>
      <br>
      John Weston<br>

      Have your ever run your car on “fumes”? They’re gas vapors that
      form when it evaporates. One man, John Weston, from Charlotte
      County, FL, has found these fumes useful and made a fueling system
      out of them so his car gets an incredible mileage: 463 miles per
      gallon! In European measurements (if I’m correct) this is
      0.8L/100km!!! Wow! <br>
      <br>
      Not even VW’s latest gadget car can’t get this mileage!<br>
      <br>
      John has found by trial and error the method to get the fuel
      vapors “inhaled” by the engine. He cut the fuel injector lines in
      his 1992 Geo Storm and adapted the whole thing to run on fuel
      vapors.<br>
      <br>
      In an interview he gave to NBC-2, John Weston states: “It came up
      to 463 miles a gallon if we had driven in the same manner – a
      gallon. I drove from here to Fort Myers, and I’m up there keeping
      up with traffic running 80 mph.” The NBC reporters were even took
      to a test drive, where the engine stumbled a little bit and John
      said he put too much vapor on the pipe, so when he lowered the
      vapors, everything got back to normal.<br>
      <br>
      Some mechanics say that disconnecting the fuel lines and not
      feeding the engine with regular liquid fuel will eventually ruin
      it. It may be so, but precautions can be taken and proper oiling
      can be made so the engine is well-lubricated. The same thing
      applies to natural gas-converted cars, and they run smoothly
      forever (it’s only gas, not oil). I don’t know much about
      mechanics, but if you find a system that gets you 463mpg, you’re
      also smart enough to find a proper lubrication system.<br>
      <br>
      NBC-2 relates that John Weston is waiting for investors, because
      he wants to sell his invention so the whole world benefits from
      it. I keep thinking about hoaxes in the energy industry. Some
      solutions are too simple and too mainstream-published to be
      hoaxes. There are also law prosecutions for that matter. I don’t
      know. It remains to be seen. In the meanwhile, it’s a great idea
      having this mileage. If that car can run on nothing else but
      gasoline vapors, an idea pops into my mind: why wouldn’t a car run
      on hydrogen, for instance? Skeptics say you need a lot of hydrogen
      (much more than you can obviously produce on-demand). Is it true
      you do need that much?<br>

      </b><br>
      John Weston what do you think?&nbsp; A story always has two sides.
      You have now a chance to explain your self. <br>
      <br>
      The short version of my story is that the AVFS, can not and will
      not work. I send it back to you as agreed. You have not paid me.
      It was delivered the 19. of August. Your promise that it would
      work was false. What you where good at was fooling me. <br>
      <br>
      I will of course not give a short testimonial on the website. I
      will have all of our emails and all my videos, and all my
      explanations why the AVFS can not work. <br>

      Hello John,<br>
      <br>
      I think it is a really great idea... For just as you read what
      Robert has told you in his email; that just twenty feet away from
      him are two engines running on vapor to his great delight. He also
      went on to tell you that there are things that do make a
      difference in the adjustment of the air/vapor mixture valve-----
      things I told you all along. As well as stating ; "do not heat the
      bubbler or the fuel". The ambient air under the hood of a vehicle
      prevents the unit from becoming too cold to operate; as mentioned
      by Robert in stating that the problem occurs when the fuel within
      the unit gets too cold for proper vapor being provided. Robert is
      telling you the same things that I told you from the beginning of
      our conversation about the AVFS. I repeatedly told you that there
      are many variances when adapting to a vehicle and that specific
      steps must be adhered to. You, on the other hand have many
      different connections and apparatus under the hood of your
      vehicle---- the "octopus", different ignition system and other
      components. These things made it more difficult to determine the
      reason you were experiencing the difficulties.<br>
      <br>
      Another mention of being able to assemble correctly was made by
      Robert concerning a different system, which goes right along with
      me telling you repeatedly that we must follow each and every step
      of the <br>
      installation in order to achieve the results we are expecting. You
      told me in an email (of which I,too, have kept each and every one
      of) that you bypassed something on more than one occasion during
      the installation.<br>
      <br>
      In all regards and with all due respect, I do not have any problem
      with you going cyber ----as you called it---- about the AVFS and
      the problem(s) you found to have when the specific steps of the
      installation took place. That will help others to know that
      different systems do require specific instructions to be followed
      when doing it yourself installations of things are conducted.<br>
      <br>
      Have a great day......&nbsp; -- John Weston<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      I bought a fuel vaporizer from you for $ 2000! For that price I
      was promised that it would work.&nbsp; I am not doing research for
      you.&nbsp; Do you remember the pictures of the gasoline turning
      dark red after the light fumes in the gas has evaporated? That is
      why the AVFS can not and will not work. The AVFS is just a cold
      bubbeler. NOTHING MORE. We all&nbsp; should know that the only way
      to vaporize fuel is to crack it. That is done by spraying fuel on
      to a 900f heated element. <br>
      <br>
      I was an idiot and trusted John Weston.<br>
      <br>
      Would it not be a lot better for you to just pay me back the
      money? How can a very unhappy customer be good for your future
      business? Why not just log on to Paypal right now? Just pay me and
      move on. ... -- JA<br>
