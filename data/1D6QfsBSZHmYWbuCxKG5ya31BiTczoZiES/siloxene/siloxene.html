      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Silicon-based materials have attracted considerable interest
      for the development of energy storage devices because of their
      ease of integration with the existing silicon semiconductor
      technology. Herein, we have prepared siloxene sheets—a
      two-dimensional (2D) silicon material—and investigated their
      energy storage properties via fabrication of a symmetric
      supercapacitor (SSC) device containing 0.5 M tetraethylammonium
      tetrafluoroborate as the electrolyte. The formation of 2D siloxene
      sheets functionalized with oxygen, hydrogen, and hydroxyl groups
      was confirmed through X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy,
      and laser Raman mapping analyses. Cyclic voltammetric studies of
      the siloxene SSC device revealed the presence of pseudocapacitance
      in the siloxene sheets that arose from an
      intercalation/deintercalation phenomenon. The galvanostatic
      charge–discharge profiles of the device displayed sloped symmetric
      triangular curves with a maximum specific capacitance of 2.18 mF
      cm−2, high energy density of 9.82 mJ cm−2, good rate capability,
      and excellent cycling stability of 98% capacitance retention after
      10 000 cycles. The siloxene SSC device delivered a maximum power
      density of 272.5 mW cm−2, which is higher than those of other
      silicon- and carbon-based SSCs, highlighting their potential for
      application in energy storage.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Silicon L2,3 x-ray emission spectra (XES) of siloxene powder
      samples prepared according to Wöohler and Kautsky (Wöhler and
      Kautsky siloxene) are presented. The results are compared with the
      Si L2,3 spectra of the reference compounds a-Si, c-Si, SiO2, and
      SiOx. A close similarity of the electronic structure of Wöhler
      siloxene to that of a-SiO0.43: H and of Kautsky siloxene to that
      of a-SiO0.87: H is found. We determine the number of oxygen atoms
      per Si atom at ~0.5 in Wöhler siloxene and ~0.8 in Kautsky
      siloxene. The relative concentrations are in good agreement with
      the results of infrared absorption measurements on the same
      samples.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>We present an overview of the current work on electron spin
      resonance (ESR) and related techniques (light-induced electron
      spin resonance (LESR), spin-dependent photoconductivity (SDPC),
      and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)) in light
      emitting porous silicon and siloxene. In particular, we discuss
      the ESR signatures of the dominant defect in these materials, the
      silicon dangling bond. In ODMR, the microscopic structure of the
      excited state is identified as a triplet exciton with a dipolar
      diameter of about 4Å. This excited state is also observed in other
      silicon-based systems emitting light in the red (annealed
      siloxene, hydrogenated silicon-oxygen alloys).<br>

      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Because of its indirect band structure, crystalline silicon
      does not show visible light emission at room temperature.
      Low-dimensional silicon polymers such as polysilanes, or silicon
      polymers with sheet-like structures, however, have a direct band
      structure. They attract considerable attention in solid-state
      physics mainly because of their outstanding luminescence
      properties. Especially the two-dimensional sheet polymers such as
      siloxene (Si6O3H6)n or polysilyne (SiH)n are promising candidates
      for technological application because of their higher mechanical
      stability and higher conductivity. Since (SiH)n, accessible from
      (SiBr)n and LiAlH4 or, more recently, from CaSi2 and HCl, is
      highly unstable and shows luminescence only in the UV part of the
      spectrum, siloxene with its strong room temperature
      photoluminescence in the green or yellow has been most thoroughly
      investigated. Research on siloxene has been further intensified by
      the recent suggestion that the efficient visible luminescence
      observed in porous silicon, a phenomenon of considerable current
      interest, is mainly due to the presence of siloxene species on the
      surface of the porous silicon particles.<br>

        <b>A. Molassioti-Dohm, et al.</b><br>
      </div>
      <b>ABSTRACT</b><b><br>
      </b>The photo- and chemiluminescence of Wohler siloxenes,
      Si,H3(OH)3+, in the two oxidation stages with x =0:yel-low sioxene
      and x =1:red sioxene were studied. During slow oxidation both
      compounds exhibit a shift of the photolu-minescence spectra at
      room temperature, but the position of the chernilurninescence is
      not affected. Our results supportthe buckled-layer structure of
      Wöhler sioxenes with the Si6-ring in chair conformation as the
      building block. The Si-Hbonds on the rmg can be successively
      oxidized (0 x3),leading to a shift in the photoluminescence
      spectrum. Totaloxidation of all three Si-H bonds results in an
      unstable modification, which transforms rapidly to a new substance
      withdistinctively different optical properties. The results on
      siloxene have common features with measurements on porous
      sil-icon. However, the quantitative differences in the spectra
      indicate that in porous silicon, the emission properties are
      notdirectly associated with Wohler siloxenes.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Layer structured siloxene prepared by the reaction of CaSi2 with
      hydrochloric acid was further oxidized by a treatment with water.
      During this treatment, the Si-Si and the Si-H bonds of the
      siloxene were oxidized to Si-O-Si and Si-OH bonds, respectively,
      and the interlayers were cross-linked by the condensation of the
      Si-OH groups. The resulting compounds have high surface areas
      (400–600 m2/g) with pores in the micropore to mesopore ranges. The
      compounds calcined in a vacuum up to 1000°C keep the high surface
      area and show peculiar electron spin resonance (ESR) centers on
      adsorption of oxygen, which are attributed to the formation of
      silicon dangling bonds. The ESR centers disappear reversibly on
      desorption of oxygen.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Two-dimensional (2D) materials are of considerable interest
      for catalyzing the heterogeneous conversion of CO2 to synthetic
      fuels. In this regard, 2D siloxene nanosheets, have escaped
      thorough exploration, despite being composed of earth-abundant
      elements. Herein we demonstrate the remarkable catalytic activity,
      selectivity, and stability of a nickel@siloxene nanocomposite; it
      is found that this promising catalytic performance is highly
      sensitive to the location of the nickel component, being on either
      the interior or the exterior of adjacent siloxene nanosheets.
      Control over the location of nickel is achieved by employing the
      terminal groups of siloxene and varying the solvent used during
      its nucleation and growth, which ultimately determines the
      distinct reaction intermediates and pathways for the catalytic CO2
      methanation. Significantly, a CO2 methanation rate of 100 mmol
      gNi−1 h−1 is achieved with over 90% selectivity when nickel
      resides specifically between the sheets of siloxene.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Two-dimensional siloxene sheets are an emerging class of
      materials with an eclectic range of potential applications
      including electrochemical energy conversion and storage sectors.
      Here, we demonstrated the dehydrogenation/dehydroxylation of
      siloxene sheets by thermal annealing at high temperature (HT) and
      investigated their supercapacitive performances using ionic liquid
      electrolyte. The X-ray diffraction analysis, spectroscopic
      (Fourier transform infrared, laser Raman, and X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy) studies, and morphological analysis of HT-siloxene
      revealed the removal of functional groups at the edges/basal
      planes of siloxene, and preservation of oxygen-interconnected Si6
      rings with sheet-like structures. The HT-siloxene symmetric
      supercapacitor (SSC) operates over a wide potential window (0–3.0
      V), delivers a high specific capacitance (3.45 mF cm–2), high
      energy density of about 15.53 mJ cm–2 (almost 2-fold higher than
      that of the as-prepared siloxene SSC), and low equivalent series
      resistance (compared to reported silicon-based SSCs) with
      excellent rate capability and long cycle life over 10 000 cycles.<br>

      The invention provides a siloxene material. A chemical formula I
      of the siloxene material is shown as Si6OxHy(OH)6-y, wherein each
      of x and y is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to
      6. The siloxene material has Si-O-Si bond, Si-H bond and Si-OH
      bond. The siloxene material is simple in preparation process and
      easy in large-scale preparation. A cathode material prepared by
      using the siloxene material has high circulating stability, high
      initial Coulomb efficiency and high rate performance. Experiment
      results show that under a condition of 150mA/g, initial
      lithium-removing capacity is 845-1329mAh/g, initial Coulomb
      efficiency is 65.2-84.1%, and capacity retention ratio after
      circulating for 200 circles is 75.0-85.3%; under a condition of
      1.5A/g, capacity retention ratio is 71.1-86.0%. The invention
      further provides a preparation method of silicon-based oxide and
      the cathode material.<br>

        <b>Device comprising a luminescent material</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Siloxene and siloxene derivatives are compatible with silicon and
      may be generated as epitaxial layer on a silicon monocrystal. This
      permits the production of novel and advantageous
      electroluminescent devices, such as displays, image converters,
      optoelectric integrated circuits. Siloxene and siloxene
      derivatives may also be advantageously employed in lasers as
      laser-active material and in fluorescent lamps or tubes as
      luminescent material...<br>
      <br>
      Siloxene Si6 O3 H6 and Si6 O3+n H6-m and its derivatives are
      known, cf. for example Gmelin, Silicon, volume B, p. 591-596. It
      forms a highly polymerized solid insoluble substance which
      contains as essential constituent silicon six-membered rings or
      silicon planes.<br>
      <br>
      Three different structural modifications of siloxene are
      illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 3, each of which shows part of the
      [111]-plane of a siloxene crystal. The large striped circles
      denote Si atoms, the large blank circles O atoms and the small
      striped circles H atoms. The most stable structure is that
      according to FIG. 1, which contains pronounced six-membered rings
      linked together by oxygen atoms.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known that siloxene exhibits photoluminescence and
      chemoluminescence and that the luminescence color can be varied by
      substitution of the H atoms of the siloxene. However, a fact
      hitherto not recognized was that siloxene, in particular on
      suitable contacting, can also exhibit electroluminescence, and nor
      had it been recognized that due to its constitution and the
      production methods available siloxene is excellently suited to
      uses in optical and electrooptical devices, in particular in
      conjunction with silicon and silicon semiconductor devices.<br>
      <br>
      A particular advantage is that the lattice constants of siloxene
      are practically identical to those of silicon. Consequently, a
      siloxene layer can be applied epitaxially to a silicon
      monocrystal, in particular to a [111]-surface of the silicon. It
      is further possible to chemically convert a surface layer of a
      monocrystalline or polycrystalline silicon body to siloxene
      without substantial modification of the structure of said layer.
      The same applies to sapphire substrates and so-called SOS
      structures ("Silicon-on-Sapphire"). A further important advantage
      is that siloxene layers can also be applied at relatively low
      temperatures, in particular.ltoreq.800 DEG C., and also to
      semiconductor substrates, in particular silicon substrates, which
      contain an integrated circuit so that by using conventional
      semiconductor fabrication techniques, such as photomasking, a
      desired configuration of electroluminescent devices on the
      integrated circuit can be produced. This gives an integrated
      electronic-electrooptical circuit. Siloxene and its derivatives
      can also advantageously be used on other substrates, such as
      glass, quartz, organic polymers (plastics), for example PMMA.<br>
      <br>
      Siloxene for use as luminescent material can be made in various
      ways, for example by a known wet chemical method according to
      Kautsky (see for example Z. anorg. Chemie 117, 209-242 (1921) or W
      ohler (see for example Liebig's Annals 127,257, 1863), and further
      by deposition from the gas phase on a suitable substrate, in
      particular, as mentioned above, monocrystalline silicon, for
      example using a mixture of SiH4, H2 O and/or H2, O2, and a
      dilution gas such as argon or another noble gas or nitrogen, and
      the reaction can be activated by light, in particular laser
      radiation, a plasma discharge, a high-frequency or microwave
      discharge, cyclotron resonance, heat, for example heating the
      substrate. Further possibilities are deposition from the liquid
      phase, for example liquid phase epitaxy, spin-coating by means of
      a suspension, and also molecular beam deposition, for example
      molecular beam epitaxy, silicon being evaporated from an effusion
      cell and hydrogen and oxygen being employed as ion beams.
      Electrochemical methods for producing siloxene are also known.<br>
      <br>
      A further wet chemical method for producing siloxene resides in
      subjecting calcium disilicide CaSi2 (or another suitable metal
      silicide of similar structure, for example silicides of other
      alkaline earth elements, such as magnesium, strontium and barium)
      to the action of fuming hydrochloric acid (38% HCl) for several
      hours and washing the reaction product with ether or water to
      remove the chlorine. In another method of this type the metal
      silicide is treated for several hours with an ice-cooled mixture
      of alcohol, water or HCl and thereafter washed with ether. In this
      case, a mixture of 60 vol. parts ethanol, 11 vol. parts H2 O and 2
      vol. parts conc. HCl has proved suitable.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction and the subsequent washing should be carried out away
      from oxygen in the dark.<br>
      <br>
      To produce a homogeneous epitaxial siloxene layer on a
      monocrystalline silicon substrate, metal silicide, in particular
      CaSi2, can advantageously be formed epitaxially on a [111] surface
      of a silicon body, as is known from publications by J. F. Morar et
      al. in Physical Review B, vol. 37, no. 5, Feb. 15, 1988, p.
      2618-2621 and J. Vac. Sci. Technol. A 6(3), May/June 1988, p.
      1340-1342. In this method, on a surface of a silicon substrate,
      preferably on a polished [111] surface of an Si monocrystal, a
      layer of calcium metal is vapour deposited with a desired
      thickness, for example 100 to 500 nm, and alloyed in by heating to
      about 800 DEG C. This layer is then converted wet chemically to
      siloxene in the manner described above by the action of HCl. In
      this manner a dense homogeneous epitaxial siloxene layer is
      obtained on a monocrystalline Si substrate which can be structured
      by photoetching, corpuscular beam etching or any other known
      semiconductor structuring method.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to apply siloxene suspended in a suitable
      solvent (e.g. ethanol) as a uniform thin layer to a substrate, for
      example by spin coating...<br>
      <br>
      In an electroluminescent electronic device the substrate of the
      possibly structured siloxene layer has a corresponding electrode
      pattern and a corresponding transparent counter electrode array,
      for example of a thin transparent layer of gold or tin oxide, is
      applied to the free surface of the siloxene.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly advantageous configuration of an electrooptical
      device consists of a layer structure including in order a
      substrate of p or n-conductive doped monocrystalline silicon, a
      thin transparent dielectric layer of for example SiO2 or Si3 N4, a
      layer of siloxene or siloxene derivative and a transparent counter
      electrode, for example of gold, tin or indium oxide. The
      transparent dielectric intermediate layer has the important
      function of being able to generate highly excited charge carriers
      by a high electric field (injection through tunnelling). The
      structure described can be protected from harmful environmental
      influences by a thin transparent layer.<br>
      <br>
      The siloxene should also be protected in other cases by a
      protective layer, for example of a transparent material, such as
      SiO2, which protects the siloxene from the action of oxygen,
      moisture and other harmful environmental influences but does not
      impair the optical function.<br>
      <br>
      A particular advantage of the use of siloxene as luminescent
      material resides in that the luminescence color can be varied by
      heating and/or substitution, also in situ and locally selectively.
      This is known in the case of photoluminescence of siloxene and for
      adjusting the luminescence color the known substitution methods
      and substituents may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen atoms of the siloxene may be successively
      substituted, for example by halogens, in particular Cl, by OH
      groups, by alcohol, a bond of a C atom of the alcohol replacing
      for example the hydrogen of the siloxene, or by other monovalent
      radicals having an electron negativity different from hydrogen.
      The substitution results in a widening to the crystal lattice of
      the siloxene in the [111]-direction. Furthermore, a shift of the
      fluorescence towards longer wavelengths takes place. For the
      substitution known method may be employed, cf. for example E.
      Hengge, Advances of Chemical Research 9, 145 (1967) and H. Ubara
      et. al., J. Non-Cryst. Solids 59&amp;60, 641 (1983).<br>
      <br>
      Since the substitution can take place after the formation and
      structuring of a siloxene layer, the substitution can be carried
      out locally differently for example by covering parts of the
      siloxene layer in which no or a different substitution is to take
      place during the substitution, for example photolithographically.
      In this manner siloxene regions may be provided on an integrated
      circuit or other electrooptical device which on electrical or
      optical stimulation emit different colors.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical properties of the siloxene or the siloxene
      derivatives can be modified specifically by heating and/or doping.
      The electrical conductivity of the siloxene may be influenced by
      substitution of a silicon atom of the plane or by interstitial
      doping, in particular with alkali metals, for example Li or Cs.
      Furthermore, the conductivity of the plane can be modified by
      intercollation of suitable molecules between every two planes.
      Finally, since undoped siloxene is an insulator, the conductivity
      of the silicon planes in a field-effect configuration can also be
      varied by charge transfer from a conductive substrate into the
      silicon planes.<br>
      <br>
      One property of luminescence of siloxene and its derivatives is a
      wide spread of excitation lifetimes which may be undesirable for
      uses in optoelectronic communications technology (data
      transmission). It may be necessary here to control the excitation
      lifetimes specifically by incorporating recombination centres, in
      particular in the form of crystal defects. This may for example be
      done by treating with ionizing radiation, such as ion beams, or by
      oxidation, and the incorporation of recombination centres may be
      carried out in locally selective manner in order to obtain a local
      structuring of the emission properties of a siloxene layer.<br>
      <br>
      Due to their structural properties and the optical properties, in
      particular the efficient photoluminescence, it is also
      advantageous to use siloxene and siloxene derivatives in other
      optical devices which operate with luminescence but not with
      electrical stimulation of the siloxene. It is possible with the
      production methods referred to above to deposit siloxene epitaxial
      layers or thin films with spatially constant or controlled
      variable redractive index on substrates such as crystalline
      silicon. Examples of such applications are the use of thin
      siloxene layers on silicon as sensor elements or optical
      waveguides. A concrete example is a sensor or- oxidizing media.
      The oxidation of the siloxene generates a chemoluminescence which
      is detected electrically in the silicon.<br>
      <br>
      Also advantageous is the deposition of siloxene or siloxene
      derivative on existing photosensitive structures for spectral
      matching (solar cells, image converters, in particular for
      converting corpuscular radiation, X-ray radiation or ultraviolet
      light to visible radiation, for improving the sensitivity). This
      makes it possible in particular to compensate at least partially
      the pronounced drop of the quantum efficiency of photodiodes on
      the basis of crystalline silicon in the wavelength range above 400
      nm. It is possible to increase the efficiency of Si-solar cells by
      a thin layer of siloxene which acts as antireflex layer and
      converts short-wave light, in particular UV light, to light of
      longer wavelengths for which the Si-sdar cell has a greater
      sensitivity.<br>
      <br>
      Since siloxene does not exhibit inversion symmetry (the
      crystalline structure cannot be transferred to itself by
      reflecting at a point) it can be employed for optical frequency
      doubling.<br>
      <br>
      Siloxene layers of adequate thickness are suitable as scintillator
      material for detecting ionizing radiation and may be employed with
      a material combination (siloxene on silicon) which is completely
      compatible with silicon technology. The advantage here resides in
      particular in the fact that no impurities are introduced and in
      the deposition of siloxene, for example from a plasma, large
      surfaces can also be formed. This use is expedient for example in
      combination with large-area amorphous silicon substrates.<br>
      <br>
      A further field of use is integrated optics on the basis of
      silicon. Here, at present materials such as SiO2 or oxinitrides
      are considered which however are not optically active in the
      visible range. Siloxene is compatible with silicon technology
      similarly to the aforementioned dielectrics, has a smaller
      refractive index than silicon and moreover due to its high
      luminescence yield has properties which can be exploited in the
      production of optically active components in integrated optics
      without requiring for this purpose substances foreign to silicon
      technology. For example, siloxene or siloxene derivative can be
      employed in such applications as optically nonlinear material for
      optical modulators, for multiplexers and lasers. In crystalline
      form or in a suspension, siloxene may also be employed directly as
      active laser material.<br>
      <br>
      The electroluminescence may be stimulated both with direct current
      and with alternating current.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to FIGS. 4 to 8, some specific examples of
      embodiments of the invention will now be explained hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows an electroluminescent device including a substrate 10
      of doped monocrystalline silicon. In this example the substrate is
      highly n-conductive and has a specific resistance of the order of
      magnitude of a few ohm-cm. Disposed on the silicon monocrystal
      forming the substrate 10 is an epitaxial siloxene layer 12 and on
      the latter a transparent electrode 14 of SnO2 or other known
      transparent conductive material compatible with siloxene is
      disposed. On the side of the substrate 10 remote from the siloxene
      layer 12 a rear electrode 16 in the form of a vapour-deposited
      aluminium layer or the like is applied.<br>
      <br>
      If a voltage is applied to the electrodes 14, 16 electrons are
      injected from the n-conductive substrate 10 and holes from the
      transparent counter electrode 14 into the siloxene layer 12 so
      that an electroluminescence occurs in the latter.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of an n-conductive substrate, a p-conductive substrate may
      also be employed, the aforementioned signs of the charge carriers
      then being reversed.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment according to FIG. 5 corresponds to that according
      to FIG. 4 except that between the substrate 10 and the siloxene
      layer 14 a thin insulating layer 18 is arranged. In a practical
      example of embodiment the insulating layer 18 consists of SiO2 and
      has a thickness of about 5 nm to 100 nm. For this purpose,
      possibly a commercially available Si substrate material with
      buried oxide layer may be employed. The insulating layer 18 is so
      thin that the charge carriers, i.e. in this case the electrons,
      tunnel therethrough when a voltage of adequate magnitude negative
      with respect to the electrode 14 is applied to the electrode 16.
      In this arrangement, the charge carriers injected into the
      siloxene layer 14 have a higher energy as regards the conduction
      band edge of siloxene than in the device according to FIG. 4 and
      consequently a more efficient injection and thus higher
      luminescence yield are obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The device according to FIG. 6 contains as substrate 10a a pn or
      pin photodiode of conventional design which has a rear electrode
      16 and a transparent electrode 14 on its light entrance side.
      Disposed on the transparent electrode 14a is a siloxene layer 12
      which in turn is covered by a transparent protective layer 20, for
      example of silicon dioxide. Electromagnetic radiation, in
      particular shortwave radiation such as UV or X-ray radiation, as
      well as corpuscular radiation, which enters the siloxene layer 12
      through the protective layer 20 is converted therein to radiation
      of longer wavelength which in turn is converted by the photodiode
      10a, 14a, 16 with high efficiency to electrical signal.<br>
      <br>
      In a modification of the device according to FIG. 6, which can be
      used as sensor device, the protective layer 20 is not present or
      is permeable or perforated so that a substance to be detected can
      generate in the siloxene layer chemoluminescence which is detected
      by the photodiode 10a.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 shows a sensor device which includes a substrate 10 of
      doped silicon, a real electrode 16 attached to the rear side
      thereof and a siloxene layer 12 disposed on the upper side. On the
      siloxene layer there is an electrode structure 22 which ill this
      case is formed in comb-like manner and leaves free portions 12a of
      the surface of the siloxene layer so that aid portions are exposed
      to the atmosphere. Under the action of radicals, such as oxidizing
      radicals, halogens, etc., the conductivity of the diode-like
      structure formed by the silicon substrate 10 and the siloxene
      layer 12 varies. A corresponding signal then occurs in a circuit
      24 which contains this structure and is only schematically
      illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows a particularly simple example of an embodiment
      according to the present invention. The device according to FIG. 8
      includes a thin siloxene layer 12 which is provided on the one
      side with a rear electrode 16 and on the other side with a
      transparent electrode 14. By applying an ac voltage to the
      electrodes 14, 16 the siloxene is stimulated to
      electroluminescence. The rear electrode can be formed as a support
      structure and consists then for example of a metal plate and/or
      forms an injecting contact, for example a Schottky contact.
      Between the siloxene layer 12 and the transparent electrode 14, in
      this case a thin transparent dielectric layer 26 of SiO2 or the
      like is also disposed and permits generation of a higher field
      strength in the siloxene. Such a dielectric layer may also be
      provided in the devices according to FIGS. 4, 5 and 7.<br>
      <br>
      Siloxene may also be advantageously employed as luminescent
      material in fluorescent lamps or tubes, in particular in
      combination with other luminescent materials. Here as well the
      siloxene is stimulated both by the UV radiation generated in the
      discharged and by electron bombardment.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to: a silicon nanosheet
      comprising a single silicon atom layer formed by arranging silicon
      atoms two-dimensionally and periodically; a silicon nanosheet
      formed by aggregating plural such silicon atom layers; a nanosheet
      solution containing the silicon nanosheet and a process for
      producing the nanosheet solution; a nanosheet aggregate; and a
      nanosheet-containing composite.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Silicon has heretofore been widely used as an important
      electronic material for a semiconductor integrated circuit, a
      thin-film transistor, and the like. Silicon has excellent
      characteristics as a material for an electronic device and is used
      also as an electronic data processing device such as a DRAM, an
      LSI, or the like. Meanwhile, a hydrogenated/hydroxylated compound,
      such as siloxene (Si6O3H6) or the like, which is a compound having
      a layered silicon skeleton, porous silicon, hydrogenated amorphous
      silicon, and others are known as luminous materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Recently it has been found that porous silicon formed by
      electrochemically etching a silicon substrate has the capability
      of visible light emitting (refer to L. T. Canham, "Silicon quantum
      wire array fabrication by electrochemical and chemical dissolution
      of wafers," Applied Physics Letters, AMERICAN INST. OF PHYSICS,
      U.S.A., Sep. 3, 1990, p. 1046 to 1048). The light-emitting
      mechanism of porous silicon has not been clarified yet but it is
      estimated that the light emission is caused by a quantum effect, a
      surface structure, or a surface oxide film.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Meanwhile in recent years, research on a nanosheet
      comprising a semiconductor material such as TiO2, MnO2, Ca2Nb3O10,
      or the like has actively been worked on. TiO2 can be obtained from
      Cs0.7Ti1.825O4 as lepidocrocite type layered titanate (refer to T.
      Sasaki and M. Watanabe, Journal of the American Chemical Society,
      U.S.A., 1998, Vol. 120, p. 4682 to 4689), MnO2 can be obtained
      from K0.45MnO2 as layered manganese oxide of an [alpha]-NaFeO2
      type associated structure (refer to JP-A No. 335522/2003 and Y.
      Omomo, T. Sasaki, L. Z. Wang and M. Watanabe, Journal of the
      American Chemical Society, U.S.A., 2003, Vol. 12, p. 3568 to
      3575), and Ca2Nb3O10 can be obtained from KCa2Nb3O10 of a layered
      perovskite structure (refer to Y. Ebina, T. Sasaki and M.
      Watanabe, Solid State Ionics, U.S.A., 2002, Vol. 151, p. 177 to
      182). In any of the cases, a nanosheet is produced by: exchanging
      ions between layers for hydrogen ions; thereafter intercalating
      quaternary ammonium ions (particularly tetrabutyl ammonium)
      between the layers; expanding the gap between the layers by
      hydration swelling and violently shaking it; and thereby peeling
      off a layered compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] With regard to silicon materials, nanocrystal silicon is
      cited as a nanoscale material. Nanocrystal silicon: shows quantum
      effect-which a conventional silicon material does not show; and
      hence attracts attention as a novel electronic material and the
      like. It is known that the nanocrystal silicon can generally be
      produced by, for example, a process of: simultaneously sputtering
      silicon and quartz glass; thereby forming an amorphous film
      wherein Si is excessively contained in SiO2 on another silicon
      substrate; and applying heat treatment at 900[deg.] C. to
      1,100[deg.] C. (refer to JP-A No. 040348/2001).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] With such background, the development of porous silicon and
      nanocrystal silicon as electronic materials for the next
      generation has been worked on increasingly actively in recent
      years. The development of a useful silicon material having a novel
      structure has been desired with the aim of using it as a more
      novel electronic material or a more novel luminous material.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In the case of nanocrystal silicon, however, the
      nanocrystal silicon is an indirect transition semiconductor and it
      requires the change of momentum when an excited carrier falls into
      a ground state. As a result, the nanocrystal silicon has a low
      luminous efficiency and has not been suitable for a luminous
      material for a luminous element and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Further, nanocrystal silicon has very fewer variations in
      the synthesis process thereof in spite of the fact that it is very
      highly appreciated as an electronic material and the like in
      practical use. As a process of synthesizing nanocrystal silicon,
      the process of forming an SiO2 film containing an excessive amount
      of Si under a reduced pressure and annealing the film at a high
      temperature of the vicinity of 1,000[deg.] C. has mainly been
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In contrast, in the case of a nanosheet comprising silicon,
      quantum effect and luminousness can be expected and hence the
      nanosheet is expected as a novel electronic material and a novel
      luminous material. However, all of the materials which have
      heretofore been successful in forming a nanosheet have been
      transition metal oxide and there has not been a case where a
      nanosheet comprising non-oxide silicon is produced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] An object of the present invention is to provide: a novel
      silicon nanosheet wherein silicon atoms are arranged
      two-dimensionally and periodically; a nanosheet solution wherein
      the silicon nanosheets disperse and suspend and a process for
      producing the nanosheet solution; a nanosheet aggregate formed by
      aggregating silicon nanosheets; and a nanosheet-containing
      composite which contains silicon nanosheets.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Further, another object of the present invention is to
      provide a silicon nanosheet having a high luminous efficiency and
      being useful as an electronic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A silicon nanosheet according to the present invention
      which attains the above objects is a silicon nanosheet comprising
      a silicon atom layer formed by bonding two-dimensionally and
      periodically arranged silicon atoms to each other through an Si-Si
      bond.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Further, a nanosheet solution according to the present
      invention is a nanosheet solution prepared by dispersing or
      suspending the silicon nanosheets according to the present
      invention in a solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Furthermore, a nanosheet-containing composite according to
      the present invention is a nanosheet-containing composite having
      the silicon nanosheets according to the present invention on the
      surface and/or in the interior of a substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Yet further, a nanosheet aggregate according to the present
      invention is a nanosheet aggregate formed by aggregating the
      silicon nanosheets according to the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Still further, a process for producing a nanosheet solution
      according to the present invention comprises: an acid treatment
      step of bringing a layered silicon compound into contact with an
      aqueous acid solution to derive a siloxene compound; and an
      exfoliation step of adding the siloxene compound into a solvent
      containing a surfactant, shaking the mixture, and peeling off the
      siloxene compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In addition, another process for producing a nanosheet
      solution according to the present invention comprises: a
      hydrothermal treatment step of dispersing a layered silicon
      compound in a solvent comprising a mixture of an amine having 3 or
      more carbon atoms and water and applying hydrothermal treatment;
      and a separation step of separating unreacted materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] When a layered silicon compound reacts with acid, the
      interlayer atoms of the layered silicon compound are replaced with
      acid molecules and a siloxene compound is formed. Successively,
      when a surfactant is added to a solution containing the siloxene
      compound and the mixture is shaken, the surfactant intrudes
      between layers and the siloxene compound swells infinitely.
      Otherwise, when a kind of amine is added to a layered silicon
      compound and the mixture is subjected to hydrothermal treatment,
      bulky amines are substituted for the interlayer atoms of the
      layered silicon compound and the layered silicon compound swells
      infinitely. As a result, a silicon nanosheet containing a single
      silicon atom layer or plural silicon atom layers is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A thus obtained silicon nanosheet is substantially composed
      of Si atoms, has two-dimensional anisotropy, and hence shows such
      unprecedentedly excellent characteristics as stated below. That
      is, a thus obtained silicon nanosheet:<br>
      (1) emits fluorescence of specific wavelengths with a specific
      excitation wavelength;<br>
      (2) has a remarkably large bandgap in comparison with bulk
      silicon;<br>
      (3) is excellent in traceability of a shape when a substrate
      surface is coated with the nanosheet;<br>
      (4) has an extremely high surface to volume ratio;<br>
      (5) exhibits high catalytic performance in the event of chemical
      reaction; and<br>
      (6) has a high thermal conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] A silicon nanosheet according to the present invention can
      be used for: an electronic material constituting a semiconductor
      integrated circuit, a thin-film transistor, and others; a luminous
      element; an electronic element; a chemical catalyst; a catalyst
      carrier; a negative electrode active material for a lithium
      secondary battery; and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Further, a nanosheet solution according to the present
      invention can be used for: a liquid fluorescent agent; a raw
      material for the production of a nanosheet-containing composite
      and a nanosheet aggregate; and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Furthermore, a nanosheet-containing composite according to
      the present invention can be used for: various kinds of electronic
      elements; a heat radiating sheet; a raw material for a powder
      magnetic core; and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In addition, a nanosheet aggregate according to the present
      invention can be used for: various kinds of catalyst carriers; a
      negative electrode active material for a lithium secondary
      battery; an absorbent; and others.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0049] An embodiment according to the present invention is
      hereunder explained in detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] A silicon nanosheet according to the present invention
      contains a silicon atom layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In the present invention, the term "a silicon atom layer"
      means a single atom layer formed by bonding two-dimensionally and
      periodically arranged silicon atoms to each other through an Si-Si
      bond.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Further, the term "two-dimensionally arranged silicon
      atoms" means that plural silicon atoms are arranged periodically
      in the directions of a and b axes (in the directions parallel with
      the layer plane) and substantially only one Si atom exists in the
      direction of c axis (in the direction perpendicular to the layer
      plane).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A silicon nanosheet according to the present invention
      comprises a single silicon atom layer or a layered product formed
      by laminating plural silicon atom layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In the case of a silicon nanosheet comprising a single
      silicon atom layer (hereunder referred to as "a single layered
      nanosheet"), the thickness thereof is about 0.5 to 1 nm. The
      thickness of a silicon atom layer somewhat varies in accordance
      with the structure thereof. For example, when silicon atoms are
      regularly arranged so as to form the same structure as a (111)
      plane in a diamond structure, the thickness of the single layered
      nanosheet is 0.6 to 0.8 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A single layered nanosheet has a large size-anisotropy (the
      ratio of a width to a thickness). As a result, when a substrate or
      the like is coated with a silicon nanosheet for example, the shape
      of the surface of the substrate can be traced in a well
      reproducible manner. Further, since the area of the sheet is
      remarkably large in comparison with the thickness thereof, the
      surface of the substrate can efficiently be coated without largely
      changing the shape of the substrate surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In contrast, in the case of a silicon nanosheet comprising
      a layered product formed by laminating plural silicon atom layers
      (hereunder referred to as "a multilayered nanosheet"), the
      thickness thereof increases in proportion to the number of the
      silicon atom layers. By using a production process to be described
      later and optimizing the production conditions, it is possible to
      synthesize a silicon nanosheet about 10 to 20 nm in thickness.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Further, when a silicon nanosheet according to the present
      invention is used for a luminous element, an indicating element,
      or the like, a preferable thickness thereof is 10 nm or less. When
      the thickness of a silicon nanosheet exceeds 10 nm, the quantum
      size effect does not show up and hence it may undesirably be
      impossible to emit fluorescence with a specific excitation
      wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The width of a silicon nanosheet depends on the
      after-mentioned production conditions (for example, agitation
      strength at shaking in an exfoliation step, or the like). By using
      the after-mentioned process, a nanosheet 10 nm to 10 [mu]m in
      width can be obtained. In general, when the width of a silicon
      nanosheet is less than 10 nm, the nanosheet tends to reaggregate
      in a liquid. On the other hand, when the width of a silicon
      nanosheet exceeds 1 [mu]m, the nanosheet tends to precipitate. In
      order to suppress the reaggregation and precipitation of a
      nanosheet, a preferable width of the nanosheet is 50 to 500 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] A silicon nanosheet has various kinds of structures and
      compositions in accordance with the production conditions.
      Concretely there are following examples.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A first concrete example of a silicon nanosheet is a
      nanosheet comprising a silicon atom layer of "a diamond type."<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Diamond has a structure wherein regular tetrahedrons each
      of which has carbon atoms in the center and at the apexes thereof
      are linked to each other in the manner of sharing the apexes
      (refer to FIG. 18A). The unit lattice of a diamond structure is
      configured by containing four such regular tetrahedrons in a cube
      and has eight atoms. The atoms are located at the positions of (a)
      0, 0, 0 and face-centering translation and (b) 1/4, 1/4, 1/4 and
      face-centering translation.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] When a (111) plane of such a diamond structure is observed
      from the &lt;111&gt; orientation, it looks like carbon
      six-membered rings are arranged periodically. Among the six atoms
      constituting a carbon six-membered ring, non-neighboring three
      atoms are located at the positions of 0, 0, 0 and face-centering
      translation (namely, on a (111) plane in the expression of
      Miller's indices). The other three atoms are located at the
      positions of 1/4, 1/4, 1/4 and face-centering translation (namely,
      on a (444) plane in the expression of Miller's indices). That is,
      a carbon six-membered ring in a diamond structure has a zigzag
      wavy structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The term "a silicon atom layer of a diamond type" means
      that the silicon atoms are regularly arranged so as to form the
      structure of a (111) plane of diamond. In other words, "a silicon
      atom layer of a diamond type" means that Si six-membered rings are
      arranged two-dimensionally and periodically and, among the six
      silicon atoms constituting each of the Si six-membered rings, the
      non-neighboring three silicon atoms are located on a plane
      corresponding to a (111) plane of Si having a diamond structure
      and the other three silicon atoms are located on a plane
      corresponding to a (444) plane of Si having a diamond structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] A silicon atom layer of a diamond type has various kinds of
      compositions in accordance with the type of a starting material
      and production conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] For example, when CaSi2 is subjected to acid treatment with
      concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature and swelled
      infinitely with a surfactant, a nanosheet having a composition
      represented by the expression (a) below and containing a silicon
      atom layer of a diamond type can be obtained;<br>
      Si6H3-[delta](OH)3+[delta](0≤[delta]≤3) (a).<br>
      <br>
      [0066] FIG. 1 shows the structure of a silicon nanosheet having a
      composition represented by the expression (a). In FIG. 1, a
      silicon nanosheet 1 is composed of a single silicon atom layer 15
      of a diamond type. The silicon atom layer 15 has a zigzag wavy
      structure like As and P. Among the four couplings of a Si atom,
      three couplings are used for Si-Si bond and the remaining one
      coupling links to H or OH.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The surface of a silicon nanosheet having a composition
      represented by the expression (a) can be negatively electrified.
      By using the surface charge, it is possible to easily coat a
      substrate surface with the silicon nanosheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Otherwise for example, when CaSi2 is subjected to acid
      treatment with concentrated hydrochloric acid at around -30[deg.]
      C. and swelled infinitely with a surfactant, a nanosheet having a
      composition represented by the expression (b) below and containing
      a silicon atom layer of a diamond type can be obtained;<br>
      (SiH)n (b).<br>
      <br>
      [0069] A silicon nanosheet having a composition represented by the
      expression (b) has the same structure as the silicon nanosheet 1
      shown in FIG. 1 except that, in the case of the former silicon
      nanosheet, all of the couplings which do not contribute to the
      Si-Si bond link to H.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] A second concrete example of a silicon nanosheet is a
      nanosheet comprising a silicon atom layer of "a graphite type."<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Graphite has a structure wherein planes (the c planes)
      formed with carbon six-membered rings are laminated in the c axis
      direction. The term "a silicon atom layer of a graphite type"
      means that silicon atoms are regularly arranged so as to form a c
      plane structure of graphite or a structure similar thereto. In
      other words, "a-silicon atom layer of a graphite type" means that:
      Si six-membered rings are arranged two-dimensionally and
      periodically; and the distance in the c axis direction between the
      Si six-membered rings composed of the six silicon atoms (in the
      direction perpendicular to the layer plane of the silicon atom
      layer) is narrower than the distance between a (111) plane and a
      (444) plane of a diamond-structured Si. That is, "a silicon atom
      layer of a graphite type" means that the six silicon atoms
      constituting a Si six-membered ring: are located on an identical
      plane; or form a zigzag structure wherein the amplitude thereof in
      the c axis direction is smaller than that of a silicon atom layer
      of a diamond type.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] By using the after-mentioned process, it is possible to
      obtain a nanosheet containing a silicon atom layer wherein the
      angle formed by the level plane and the direction of an adjacent
      Si atom is in the range of 0 to 100 when viewed from the direction
      of the a axis of the silicon atom layer (from the direction
      parallel with the layer plane).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A silicon atom layer of a graphite type has various kinds
      of compositions in accordance with the type of a starting material
      and production conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] For example, when YbSi2 is subjected to acid treatment
      under prescribed conditions and swelled infinitely with a
      surfactant, a nanosheet having a composition represented by the
      expression (c) below and containing a silicon atom layer of a
      graphite type can be obtained;<br>
      Si6H3-[delta](OH)3+[delta](0≤[delta]≤3) (c).<br>
      <br>
      [0075] FIG. 14 shows the structure of a silicon nanosheet having a
      composition represented by the expression (c). In FIG. 14, a
      silicon nanosheet 7 is composed of a single silicon atom layer 75
      of a graphite type. Among four couplings of a Si atom, three
      couplings are used for Si-Si bond and the remaining one coupling
      links to H or OH.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Meanwhile for example, when CaSi2 is subjected to
      hydrothermal treatment in an amine aqueous solution, a nanosheet
      having a composition represented by the expression (d) below and
      containing a silicon atom layer of a graphite type can be
      obtained;<br>
      SiOx (0≤x≤0.5) (d).<br>
      <br>
      [0077] FIG. 18B shows the structure of a silicon nanosheet having
      a composition represented by the expression (d). Here, the
      structure of diamond type silicon is also shown in FIG. 18A. A
      silicon nanosheet having a composition represented by the
      expression (d) contains a planar silicon atom layer formed with Si
      six-membered rings. Further, oxygen is added to parts of the
      silicon atom layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] A part of a silicon atom layer may be modified with an
      organic modified group. In each of such various kinds of silicon
      atom layers as stated above, a Si atom has a coupling which does
      not contribute to Si-Si bond. It is estimated that such a coupling
      links to H, OH, O, or the like. When all or some of such couplings
      are modified with an organic modified group (a substituent), it is
      possible to impart the functions of the organic modified group
      (for example, the functions as a chemical catalyst and the like)
      to a silicon nanosheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] As organic modified groups for example, there are an alkyl
      group, an alkenyl group, an alkoxy group, a carboxyl group, an
      acyl group, a thiol group, a sulfo group, an amino group, and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The most remarkable point of a silicon nanosheet according
      to the present invention is that: the silicon nanosheet comprises
      a single silicon atom layer wherein silicon atoms are arranged in
      a nearly planar shape; or the silicon nanosheet is formed by
      aggregating plural silicon atom layers in each of which silicon
      atoms are arranged in a nearly planar shape. That is, a silicon
      nanosheet according to the present invention: is a novel one which
      comprises a silicon atom layer having two-dimensional anisotropy;
      and is different from a nanosheet comprising conventional
      transition metal oxide such as manganese oxide, titanium oxide,
      and the like. A silicon nanosheet is basically non-oxide, has
      two-dimensional anisotropy, and hence has such excellent
      characteristics as stated below.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Firstly, a silicon nanosheet shows a peak in the visible
      light region in the measurement of a fluorescence spectrum. When a
      silicon nanosheet is irradiated with excitation light having a
      specific excitation wavelength, it emits fluorescence having
      specific wavelengths. More specifically, a silicon nanosheet emits
      fluorescence having the wavelengths of 450 to 600 nm when an
      excitation wavelength in the range of 400 to 500 nm is applied.
      Further, by optimizing the thickness of a nanosheet, the nanosheet
      emits fluorescence composed of three kinds of light having the
      peak wavelengths of 465±5 nm, 505±5 nm, and 560±5 nm, respectively
      when an excitation wavelength of, for example, 400 nm is applied.
      Here, the term "peak" means an apex of a spectrum in fluorescence
      spectrum measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] All of those wavelengths are in the visible light region
      and can be observed as green fluorescence. By using this
      phenomenon, it is possible to use a silicon nanosheet or a
      nanosheet solution prepared by dispersing or suspending the
      silicon nanosheets in a solvent for a luminous element, an
      indicating material, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Secondly, in the case of a silicon nanosheet, the bandgap
      obtained through light absorption is 3.0 eV or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The bandgaps of major materials used as semiconductors are
      1.1135 eV in the case of Si, 1.428 eV in the case of GaAs, 3.02 eV
      in the case of 4H-SiC, and 5.47 eV in the case of diamond. Bulk
      silicon shows only a three-dimensional structure of a diamond type
      at normal pressures and another kind of structure thereof has not
      been known. For that reason, the bandgap of conventional silicon
      has never exceeded the value of the bulk silicon (1.1135 eV).<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In contrast, a silicon nanosheet shows a larger bandgap
      than bulk silicon. The bandgap tends to increase as the thickness
      of a nanosheet reduces. By using the after-mentioned process, a
      silicon nanosheet having a bandgap of 3.0 eV or more can be
      obtained. The detailed mechanism of obtaining a wide bandgap by
      forming a nanosheet is not obvious but it is estimated that the
      planar structure, oxygen contained in a small amount, and others
      may presumably influence the phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] When conventionally used silicon is replaced with a
      material having a large bandgap and a large dielectric breakdown
      electric field, it is possible to reduce the thickness of each
      layer of an element and also to apply high concentration doping.
      As a consequence, it is possible to make an element having a high
      withstand voltage and a small on resistance. That is, by using a
      silicon nanosheet according to the present invention, it is
      possible to get rid of the trade-off between withstand voltage and
      on resistance, and make a low-loss high-voltage power element.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Thirdly, a silicon nanosheet has large two-dimensional
      shape anisotropy. Thereby, it is possible to coat the outer and
      inner surfaces of various kinds of substrates with nanosheets.
      Further, by so doing, it is possible to impart the functions
      intrinsic to a nanosheet to a substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Fourthly, a silicon nanosheet or an aggregate of the
      silicon nanosheets has an extremely high surface to volume ratio.
      Consequently, by making use of the high surface to volume ratio,
      it is possible to use a silicon nanosheet or an aggregate of the
      silicon nanosheets for various applications (for example, a
      photocatalyst, a solid lubricant, and the like).<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Fifthly, a silicon nanosheet exhibits high activity in the
      event of chemical reaction. Thereby, it is possible to use a
      silicon nanosheet as, for example, a negative electrode active
      material of a lithium secondary battery. Further, the negative
      electrode active material comprising a silicon nanosheet can be a
      high capacity material, thereby can be an ultrathin membrane
      electrode with the use of a small amount, and hence has the
      characteristics of hardly causing the downward slip from the
      electrode and being excellent in cyclic performance.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Sixthly, a silicon nanosheet is substantially composed of
      Si and hence has a high thermal conductivity. Consequently, by
      complexing a silicon nanosheet with, for example, resin, it is
      possible to increase the heat dissipation of the resin.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] A silicon nanosheet according to the present invention has
      such excellent characteristics as stated above and hence can be
      used as: an electronic material constituting a semiconductor
      integrated circuit, a thin-film transistor or the like; a luminous
      element; an indicating element; or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Next, a nanosheet solution according to the present
      invention is explained. A nanosheet solution according to the
      present invention is prepared by dispersing or suspending silicon
      nanosheets according to the present invention in a solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] As the solvents in which silicon nanosheets are dispersed,
      polar solvents such as water, alcohol, glycol, ether and the like,
      and a solvent comprising the mixture of those can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Further, in the silicon nanosheet solution, a surfactant or
      an amine caused by the after-mentioned production process is
      contained. A surfactant or an amine has the effects of: preventing
      silicon nanosheets dispersing in a solvent from aggregating; and
      maintaining a stable dispersed state.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The concentration of silicon nanosheets in a solution is
      not particularly limited and can arbitrarily be selected in
      accordance with the application of the solution. In general, when
      the concentration of silicon nanosheets is too low, the operation
      efficiency lowers in the use for various applications and the
      various functions of the nanosheets lower. On the other hand, when
      the concentration of silicon nanosheets is too high, the silicon
      nanosheets may undesirably aggregate in the solution. In order to
      stably disperse silicon nanosheets without the deterioration of
      operation efficiency and functions, the concentration of silicon
      nanosheets is preferably 0.1 to 10 wt %, and yet preferably 0.5 to
      3.0 wt %.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] In order to stably disperse silicon nanosheets in a
      solvent, it is preferable that the width of a silicon nanosheet is
      as small as possible. More specifically, when the width of a
      silicon nanosheet is 1 [mu]m or less, a stable colloidal solution
      is formed and so-called "a Tyndall phenomenon" shows up.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Next, a process for producing a nanosheet solution
      according to the present invention is explained.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] A process for producing a nanosheet solution according to a
      first embodiment of the present invention includes an acid
      treatment step and an exfoliation step.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] An acid treatment step is a step of bringing a layered
      silicon compound into contact with an aqueous acid solution to
      derive a siloxene compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Here, the term "a layered silicon compound" means one of a
      group of compounds represented by the chemical composition formula
      AxSi2 (A represents Ca and/or Yb, 0.8≤x≤1.2). A layered silicon
      compound has a structure wherein an A atom layer is sandwiched
      between layered network structures (silicon atom layers) of Si.
      The interlayer atom A may be either Ca or Yb, or both of Ca and
      Yb.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The term "a siloxene compound" means a compound obtained by
      bringing a layered silicon compound into contact with an aqueous
      acid solution, wherein acid molecules are substituted for all or
      some of the interlayer atoms A. Adjacent silicon atom layers are
      attracted to each other by the acid molecules interposed between
      the layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The term "an aqueous acid solution" means an aqueous
      solution containing acid such as hydrochloric acid or the like. As
      the solvent of an aqueous acid solution, besides water, a solvent
      comprising the mixture of water and alcohol such as ethanol,
      methanol, or the like can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] It is difficult to directly remove atoms (Ca or Yb)
      existing between layers of a layered network structure formed with
      Si. In the acid treatment step, therefore, acid molecules are
      substituted for interlayer atoms by subjecting a layered silicon
      compound to acid treatment and a siloxene compound is derived.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The type of acid used in the acid treatment step is not
      particularly limited but concentrated hydrochloric acid is
      particularly preferable. By using concentrated hydrochloric acid
      as an aqueous acid solution, it is possible to easily remove
      interlayer atoms without oxidizing the two-dimensional skeleton of
      Si.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Further, with regard to the amount of an aqueous acid
      solution, any amount is acceptable as long as the amount is not
      less than an amount which allows acid molecules to be substituted
      for interlayer atoms contained in a layered silicon compound. The
      optimum amount varies in accordance with the type of a layered
      silicon compound, the concentration of an aqueous acid solution,
      and others. Usually however, concentrated hydrochloric acid (12 N)
      is added by 100 ml per 1 g of a layered silicon compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] When a layered silicon compound is subjected to acid
      treatment, the temperature of the aqueous acid solution influences
      the composition of a siloxene compound. For example, when CaSi2
      which is a kind of layered silicon compound is processed with
      concentrated hydrochloric acid at around room temperature, a
      siloxene compound (Weiss type siloxene) represented by the
      chemical composition formula
      Si6H3-[delta](OH)3+[delta](0≤[delta]≤3) is obtained. In contrast
      for example, when CaSi2 is processed with concentrated
      hydrochloric acid at around -30[deg.] C., a siloxene compound
      (layered polysilane) represented by the chemical composition
      formula (SiH)n is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Further, in general, as the temperature of an aqueous acid
      solution rises, the two-dimensional skeleton of Si tends to be
      oxidized. In order to remove interlayer atoms with scarcely
      oxidizing the two-dimensional skeleton of Si constituting a
      layered silicon compound, it is preferable to lower the
      temperature of an aqueous acid solution as low as possible. More
      specifically, a desirable temperature of an aqueous acid solution
      is 0[deg.] C. or lower. In this case, it is possible to easily
      synthesize a siloxene compound scarcely containing impurities such
      as silica (SiO2) and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] With regard to the duration of acid treatment, any duration
      may be accepted as long as it is sufficiently long for
      substituting acid molecules for the interlayer atoms of a layered
      silicon compound. The optimum duration: varies somewhat in
      accordance with the concentration and temperature of an aqueous
      acid solution, the amount of a layered silicon compound added to
      the aqueous acid solution, and others; but usually is 1 to 3 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Further, in order to prevent the two-dimensional skeleton
      of Si from oxidizing, it is preferable to apply acid treatment in
      an inert atmosphere such as an atmosphere of argon, N2, or the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] A siloxene compound obtained through the acid treatment
      step either may be subjected directly to the after-mentioned
      exfoliation step or may be washed further with an aqueous solution
      of acid such as hydrochloric acid or the like (a first washing
      step). When the siloxene compound is further washed with acid
      after the acid treatment, salt (for example, calcium salt) as a
      by-product can be removed and hence a nanosheet solution of a
      higher purity can be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Further, the siloxene compound may be washed further with
      an organic solvent after washed with an aqueous acid solution (a
      second washing step). When the siloxene compound is further washed
      with an organic solvent, excessive acid such as hydrochloric acid
      used in the first washing step can be removed and hence a
      nanosheet solution of a far higher purity can be produced. As
      organic solvents used for washing, for example, there are acetone,
      ethanol, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Further, in a siloxene compound obtained by subjecting a
      layered silicon compound to acid treatment, some of the Si atoms
      are hydrogenated and/or hydroxylated. When the siloxene compound
      is further dispersed in water and agitated at room temperature, it
      is possible to add oxygen to some of the Si atoms. Otherwise, when
      the siloxene compound is further refluxed in an aqueous solution
      containing iodide RI (R represents an alkyl group, an alkenyl
      group, an alkoxy group, a carboxyl group, an acyl group, a thiol
      group, a sulfo group, an amino group, or the like) including
      methyl iodide (CH3I) or the like, it is possible to add an organic
      modified group to some of the Si atoms. An oxidized, hydrogenated,
      or hydroxylated silicon nanosheet or a silicon nanosheet to which
      an organic modified group is added can be produced after the
      after-mentioned exfoliation step in accordance with the kinds of
      processes applied to a siloxene compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] An exfoliation step is a step of adding a siloxene compound
      into a solvent containing a surfactant, shaking the mixture, and
      peeling off the siloxene compound. By so doing, the siloxene
      compound swells infinitely and a single layered or multilayered
      nanosheet wherein silicon atoms are arranged nearly planarly and
      periodically can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] As surfactants, there are an anionic surfactant, a cationic
      surfactant, a neutral surfactant, and others. Any of those
      surfactants may be used in the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] As the anionic surfactants, there are, for example, sodium
      dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium perfluorooctanoate (SPFO), sodium
      alkylbenzenesulfonate such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate or
      the like, sodium stearate, and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] As the cationic surfactants, there are, for example,
      tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAOH), tetramethylammonium
      ((CH3)4NOH), tetraethylammonium ((C2H5)4NOH), tetrapropyl ammonium
      ((C3H7)4NOH), n-ethylamine (C2H5NH2), n-propylamine (C3H7NH2), and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] As the neutral surfactants, there are, for example, P-1,2,3
      (block copolymer, HO(CH2CH2O)20(CH2CH(CH3)O)70(CH2CH20)20H), and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] With regard to a solvent to which a surfactant is added,
      any solvent may be used as long as it can dissolve the surfactant.
      As the concrete solvents, water, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and
      others can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The concentration of a surfactant in a solution affects the
      thickness of a silicon nanosheet. A. surfactant has the functions
      of intruding between the layers of a siloxene compound, expanding
      the distance between the silicon atom layers, and facilitating the
      exfoliation. In general, as the concentration of a surfactant
      relatively increases, the surfactant tends to be substituted for
      all of the acid molecules and the constituent ions thereof
      intruding between the layers and hence it becomes easier to peel
      off the silicon atom layers and form single layers. On the other
      hand, when the concentration of a surfactant relatively decreases,
      a multilayered nanosheet tends to be obtained. Here, a
      multilayered nanosheet may sometimes be formed also by aggregating
      nanosheets which are once peeled off to form single layers in a
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The optimum concentration: varies in accordance with the
      structure and composition of a nanosheet to be produced, the type
      of the surfactant, and others; but is usually in the range of 0.01
      to 1.0 mol/dm&lt;3&gt; .<br>
      <br>
      [0121] With regard to the amount of a surfactant solution, any
      amount is acceptable as long as the amount is sufficient to
      efficiently insert the surfactant between the layers of a siloxene
      compound. The optimum amount varies in accordance with the
      concentration of a surfactant, the amount of the siloxene compound
      added to the solution, and others, but usually a surfactant
      solution containing a surfactant in the amount corresponding to
      the amount one to two times the siloxene compound by mol is added.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Further, it is preferable that a surfactant solution is
      acidic. In the case where a siloxene compound is added to a
      surfactant solution and shaken, when the pH of the solution
      increases, the two-dimensional skeleton of Si is oxidized and
      silica tends to form. In contrast, when the solution is acidic,
      the oxidation of the two-dimensional skeleton of Si can be
      suppressed. Specifically, the pH of a surfactant solution is
      preferably 5 or lower.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] For example, when an anionic surfactant or a neutral
      surfactant is used as a surfactant, it is preferable to add acid
      such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, or acetic
      acid in a solution and adjust pH to 5 or lower. In particular, in
      the case of an anionic surfactant, a siloxene compound is easily
      peeled off and moreover silica is more easily and surely prevented
      from forming by adjusting the pH of a solution, and hence the
      anionic surfactant is particularly suitable for a surfactant used
      in the exfoliation step.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] On the other hand, when a cationic surfactant is used as a
      surfactant, acid is formed during the reaction process and hence
      it sometimes happens that the exfoliation of silicon atom layers
      resultantly proceeds in an acidic region. In such a case, even
      when pH is not particularly adjusted in an acidic region, it is
      possible to peel off a siloxene compound without oxidizing the
      two-dimensional skeleton of Si.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] After a siloxene compound is added to a surfactant
      solution, the solution is shaken mechanically or with supersonic
      waves. The strength and time of the shaking influence the
      thickness and width of a nanosheet. In general, as the strength of
      shaking increases and/or the time thereof also increases, the
      thickness of a nanosheet tends to reduce (namely, the probability
      of obtaining a single layered nanosheet increases) and/or the
      width of the nanosheet tends to reduce. The optimum shaking time
      varies in accordance with a shaking process, a shaking strength,
      and others, but usually is 3 to 7 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] For example, in order to peel off a siloxene compound to a
      thickness of 10 nm or less, it is preferable to: add a surfactant
      solution of 100 to 1,000 mL having the surfactant concentration of
      0.01 to 1.0 mol/dm&lt;3 &gt; to a siloxene compound of 1 g; and
      shake the solution for 3 to 7 days under the condition of 100 to
      250 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Otherwise for example, in order to peel off a siloxene
      compound to form single layers, it is preferable to add a
      surfactant solution of 500 to 1,000 mL having the surfactant
      concentration of 0.5 to 0.8 mol/dm&lt;3 &gt; to a siloxene
      compound of 1 g; and shake the solution for 5 to 10 days under the
      condition of 100 to 250 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] When a siloxene compound is added to a surfactant solution
      and the mixture is shaken under prescribed conditions, the
      siloxene compound peels off and a nanosheet solution containing
      silicon nanosheets is obtained. For example, when Weiss type
      siloxene Si6H3(OH)3 is added to a surfactant solution and the
      mixture is shaken, a suspended nanosheet solution of pale
      yellow-green color is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Here, it sometimes happens that solid materials (an
      unreacted siloxene compound, a coarse nanosheet, and others) may
      settle in a solution under some shaking conditions. In such a
      case, the solid materials are removed by centrifugal separation or
      the like. A nanosheet solution after solid materials have been
      removed is extremely stable and shows light scattering (a Tyndall
      phenomenon) intrinsic to colloid. Further, when a nanosheet
      solution is subjected to centrifugal separation, by optimizing the
      separation conditions, most of multilayered nanosheets are removed
      from the solution and a nanosheet solution having a high content
      of single layered nanosheets can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The structure and composition of a silicon nanosheet
      contained in a thus obtained nanosheet solution vary in accordance
      with the kind of the layered silicon compound and the production
      conditions. For example, when CaSi2 is used as a layered silicon
      compound and subjected to acid treatment and exfoliation, a
      nanosheet containing a silicon atom layer of a diamond type is
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] A crystal structure of CaSi2 which is a kind of layered
      silicon compound is shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 2, CaSi2 (a layered
      silicon compound 12) has a structure wherein a Ca atom layer 22 is
      sandwiched between layers of a layered network structure 21 of Si.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] CaSi2 is one of typical Zintl phases and the formal charge
      thereof is represented by Ca&lt;2+&gt; (Si&lt;-&gt; )2. Here,
      Si&lt;-&gt; has an electron structure equivalent to phosphorus
      which is one of the fifth family elements in the periodic law of
      elements and forms a layered network structure similar to arsenic
      and black phosphorus. That is, CaSi2 is viewed as being a layered
      crystal wherein a Ca atom layer 22 is inserted between (111)
      planes of Si having a diamond structure (a layered network
      structure 21 of Si).<br>
      <br>
      [0133] When such a layered silicon compound is processed with an
      aqueous acid solution, the interlayer atoms are removed and acid
      molecules intrude between the layers. The reaction caused when
      CaSi2 as a kind of layered silicon compound is subjected to acid
      treatment with an HCl aqueous solution is shown with the
      expression (1) below;<br>
      3CaSi2+7HCl-&gt;Si6H3(OH)3.HCl+3CaCl2+3H2 (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The crystal structure of a siloxene compound obtained
      through the reaction represented by the expression (1) is shown in
      FIG. 3. When CaSi2 is processed with an HCl aqueous solution, Ca
      between the layers is removed and Weiss type siloxene
      (Si6H3(OH)3.HCl) which is a kind of siloxene compound is derived.
      Weiss type siloxene (a siloxene compound 3) has a structure
      wherein HCl molecules are inserted between silicon atom layers 15
      as shown in FIG. 3. The silicon atom layers 15 are attracted to
      each other through the HCl. The distance between the silicon atom
      layers 15 is about 6 Ȧ.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] A siloxene compound obtained through acid treatment is: if
      needed, subjected to washing with an aqueous acid solution (a
      first washing step), washing with an organic solvent (a second
      washing step), oxidation, modification with an organic modified
      group, and others; and thereafter added to a surfactant solution
      of a prescribed concentration and a prescribed amount. When a
      siloxene compound is added to a surfactant solution, the
      surfactant intrudes between layers of the siloxene compound and
      the distance between the layers expands.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The crystal structure of a compound obtained by adding a
      siloxene compound 3 shown in FIG. 3 to a sodium dodecyl sulfate
      (SDS) solution is shown in FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, when the
      siloxene compound 3 is added to a solution containing a surfactant
      (SDS) 4, HCl molecules or the constituent ions thereof inserted
      between silicon atom layers 15 are replaced with bulky guest
      molecules (SDS). As a result, the distance between the silicon
      atom layers 15 expands to about 100 Ȧ.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] When the surfactant 4 is inserted between the silicon atom
      layers 15, the bonding force between the silicon atom layers 15
      weakens. Thereby, when the solution is shaken, the constraining
      force between the silicon atom layers 15 is cut and the silicon
      atom layers 15 peel off as shown in FIG. 5. Then, by optimizing
      the conditions in the exfoliation step, it is possible to peel off
      the silicon atom layers 15 to form single layers. By further
      optimizing the conditions in the exfoliation step, it is possible
      to suppress the oxidation of a Si skeleton when the silicon atom
      layers 15 are peeled off. As a result, a silicon nanosheet
      substantially composed of Si is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] The crystal structure of YbSi2 which is a kind of layered
      silicon compound is shown in FIG. 13. In FIG. 13, YbSi2 (a layered
      silicon compound 6) has a structure wherein a Yb atom layer 62 is
      sandwiched between layers of a layered network structure 61 of Si
      and forms an AlB2-type layered disilicide structure. In YbSi2, Si
      forms a flat layered network structure 61 similar to graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] When YbSi2 is used as a layered silicon compound too, a
      siloxene compound is derived through acid treatment likewise.
      Successively, when the obtained siloxene compound is added to a
      surfactant solution and the solution is shaken, a silicon
      nanosheet 7 containing a silicon atom layer 75 of a graphite type
      is obtained as shown in FIG. 14.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Silicon nanosheets according to the present invention are
      contained in a thus obtained nanosheet solution and hence, by
      making use of the characteristics, the nanosheet solution can be
      used for various kinds of applications as shown below.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] (1) The silicon nanosheet, as stated above, emits
      fluorescence of specific wavelengths with a specific excitation
      wavelength. Hence, the nanosheet solution can be used as it is for
      a liquid fluorescent agent and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] (2) When a substrate surface is coated with the nanosheet
      solution or a substrate is dipped into the nanosheet solution, it
      is possible to coat the substrate surface with a nanosheet. Since
      a nanosheet solution in a colloidal state is excellent in
      film-formability and casting properties in particular, it is
      possible to uniformly coat a substrate surface with a nanosheet
      even when the substrate has a complicated shape.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] (3) When a substrate surface coated with the nanosheet is
      heated under appropriate conditions, hydrogen, a hydroxyl and
      others are separated and a silicon crystal or a silicon membrane
      can be formed on the substrate surface. That is, by using the
      nanosheet solution, it is possible to obtain a silicon crystal or
      a silicon membrane with ease without employing a crushing means, a
      melting means, a sputtering means, a vapor deposition means, or
      the like. The obtained silicon crystal and membrane can be used
      for an electronic material for the production of: a semiconductor
      integrated circuit, a thin-film transistor, or the like; a
      luminous element; an indicating element; or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] (4) When a substrate surface is coated with the nanosheet
      and thereafter the coated substrate is heated in an oxidizing
      atmosphere, it is possible to uniformly coat the substrate surface
      with a very thin silica (SiO2) membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] (5) Whereas silicon obtained by a chemical vapor deposition
      process (a CVD process) or the like is generally spherical, a
      flaky silicon nanosheet is obtained by a production process
      according to the present invention. The nanosheet has a very high
      surface to volume ratio and exhibits high catalytic performance in
      the event of chemical reaction, and hence a nanosheet solution in
      which the nanosheets disperse can be used as various kinds of
      catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Next, a process for producing a nanosheet solution
      according to a second embodiment of the present invention is
      explained.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] A process for producing a nanosheet solution according to
      the present embodiment includes a hydrothermal treatment step and
      a separation step.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The hydrothermal treatment step is a step of dispersing a
      layered silicon compound in a solvent comprising the mixture of an
      amine having 3 or more carbon atoms and water and applying
      hydrothermal treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] In the present invention, the term "an amine" means an
      organic compound having an amino group (-NH2) (a first amine). The
      amine may be an amine having one amino group (a univalent amine)
      or an amine having two or more amino groups (a multivalent amine).
      In particular, a univalent amine has the large effect of peeling
      off silicon atom layers to form single layers and hence is
      suitable for an amine used in a hydrothermal treatment step.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] Further, it is preferable that an amine has 3 or more
      carbon atoms. Furthermore, it is preferable that an amine is a
      straight-chain type. When an amine of molecules having a
      relatively large number of carbon atoms and/or molecules of a
      straight-chain type (namely somewhat bulky molecules) is used, the
      amine is inserted between silicon atom layers, thereby the
      distance between the silicon atom layers expands, and the silicon
      atom layers is easily peeled off to form single layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] As the concrete amines, there are propylamine (C3H7NH2),
      butylamine (C4H9NH2), pentylamine (C5H11NH2), hexylamine
      (C6H13NH2), peptylamine (C7H15NH2), octylamine (C8H17NH2), and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] Here, with regard to a layered silicon compound, the
      production process thereof is the same as the production process
      according to the first embodiment and therefore the explanations
      are omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] With regard to the concentration of an amine contained in a
      mixed solvent, any concentration is acceptable as long as it is a
      concentration which allows the amine to be efficiently substituted
      for the interlayer atoms contained in a layered silicon compound.
      In general, as an amine concentration increases, the amine is more
      easily substituted for interlayer atoms. Meanwhile, when an amine
      concentration is too high, a lamella structure wherein a silicon
      layer is linked to the amine is undesirably formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] In order to efficiently obtain a nanosheet, an amine
      concentration in a mixed solvent is preferably 10 to 30 vol %, and
      yet preferably 15 to 25 vol %.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] With regard to the amount of a mixed solvent used in a
      hydrothermal treatment step, any amount is acceptable as long as
      it is an amount which allows the amine to be substituted for the
      interlayer atoms contained in a layered silicon compound. The
      optimum amount varies in accordance with the kind of a layered
      silicon compound, the concentration of a mixed solvent, and
      others, but is usually 50 to 200 mL per 1 g of a layered silicon
      compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] A preferable hydrothermal treatment temperature is
      120[deg.] C. to 180[deg.] C. When the hydrothermal treatment
      temperature is lower than 120[deg.] C., the exfoliation of silicon
      atom layers does not proceed within a practical time. On the other
      hand, when the hydrothermal treatment temperature exceeds
      180[deg.] C., a sheet is likely to decompose.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] With regard to hydrothermal treatment duration, the optimum
      duration is selected in accordance with a hydrothermal treatment
      temperature. In general, when hydrothermal treatment duration is
      short, the exfoliation of silicon atom layers is insufficient. On
      the other hand, superfluous hydrothermal treatment has no
      practical benefits. For example, when a hydrothermal treatment
      temperature is 120[deg.] C., a nanosheet can be obtained through
      hydrothermal treatment for 3 days or longer.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] The separation step is a step of separating unreacted
      materials from a mixed solvent after hydrothermal treatment. By
      separating unreacted materials from a mixed solvent, a nanosheet
      solution according to the present invention is obtained. A process
      for separating unreacted materials is not particularly limited but
      centrifugal separation is preferable.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] By using a process according to the present embodiment, a
      nanosheet solution containing silicon nanosheets having various
      widths or a nanosheet solution wherein single-layered nanosheets
      and multilayered nanosheets coexist is obtained. When the obtained
      nanosheet solution is subjected to centrifugal separation under
      appropriate conditions, coarse nanosheets are separated and a
      nanosheet solution of a colloidal state is obtained. Also, by
      optimizing separation conditions, a nanosheet solution containing
      a larger amount of single-layered nanosheets is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] The detailed mechanism wherein a silicon nanosheet is
      obtained by the process according to the present embodiment is not
      obvious but it is estimated that the reason why a silicon
      nanosheet is obtained is that bulky amine molecules are
      substituted for the interlayer atoms of a layered silicon compound
      through hydrothermal treatment and the silicon atom layers swell
      infinitely. Further, it is estimated that the reason why a
      multilayered nanosheet is obtained by the process according to the
      present embodiment is that the nanosheets which have once been
      peeled off to form single layers by hydrothermal treatment are
      reaggregated in a solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Furthermore, in the process according to the present
      embodiment, by changing the kind of a used layered silicon
      compound and conditions, silicon nanosheets having various
      structures are obtained. For example, when CaSi2 is used as a
      layered silicon compound and subjected to hydrothermal treatment
      in a mixed solvent containing a straight-chain univalent amine, a
      nanosheet containing a silicon atom layer of a graphite type can
      be synthesized.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] Next, a nanosheet-containing composite according to the
      present invention and a process for producing the composite are
      explained.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] A nanosheet-containing composite according to the present
      invention is configured by having a silicon nanosheet according to
      the present invention on the surface and/or in the interior of a
      substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] Here, the term "a substrate" means a material other than a
      silicon nanosheet, and the kind and the shape of the material make
      no matter. That is, the kind of the substrate may be any of glass,
      ceramics, metal, resin and others. Further, the shape of the
      substrate may be any of a plate, a bar, a pipe, a sheet, a porous
      body, powder, and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0165] The term "having a silicon nanosheet on the surface of a
      substrate" means that all or a part of the surface (including the
      inner surface) of a substrate is coated with a silicon nanosheet.
      The substrate surface may be coated with either a single-layered
      silicon nanosheet or a two-or-more-layered silicon nanosheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] The term "having a silicon nanosheet in the interior of a
      substrate" means that silicon nanosheets disperse in the interior
      of a substrate. The nanosheets may uniformly disperse in an
      overall substrate or the content of nanosheets may vary according
      to the location.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] A nanosheet-containing composite according to the present
      invention can be produced by a variety of processes. Specifically,
      there are the following processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] A first process is a process of coating a substrate surface
      directly with a nanosheet solution or dipping a substrate directly
      into a nanosheet solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] A nanosheet is likely to be charged negatively in a
      solution. In such a case, it is preferable to use a material which
      is charged positively in a solution (for example,
      polydialyldimethylammonium (PDDA), polyethyleneimine (PEI), or the
      like) as the substrate. When a material which is likely to be
      charged positively is used as the substrate, it is possible to
      easily form a nanosheet membrane on the substrate surface due to
      the electrical interaction between the substrate and the nanosheet
      solution merely by coating the substrate with a nanosheet solution
      or dipping the substrate into a nanosheet solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] A second process is a process of making a substrate surface
      alternately adsorb a nanosheet and a material having an electric
      charge of a polarity opposite that of the nanosheet (hereunder
      referred to as "a second material") in a solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] When a substrate is a material which has no electric charge
      or has electric charge of the same polarity as that of a nanosheet
      (for example, poly(sodium4-styrenesulfonate) (-CH2CH(C6H4SO3Na)n-)
      or the like) in a solution, a uniform nanosheet membrane is hardly
      formed even when the substrate surface is directly coated with a
      nanosheet solution. In contrast, it is possible to easily form a
      nanosheet membrane on the substrate surface due to the electrical
      interaction between the second material and the nanosheet solution
      by coating a substrate surface with the second material
      beforehand.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] As stated above, a nanosheet is likely to be charged
      negatively in a solution. In such a case, a substrate surface is
      coated beforehand with a material which is positively charged in a
      solution. As concrete materials which are positively charged,
      there are cationic resins such as polydiallyl dimethyl
      ammoniumchloride (PDADMAC), polyethyleneimine (PEI),
      polyallylamine hydrochloride (PAH), and others. A substrate
      surface may be coated with one layer of the second material and
      one layer of the noanosheet in this order or the second material
      and the nanosheet may be adsorbed alternately to form plural
      layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] Further, when a substrate is a material having electric
      charge of a polarity opposite that of a nanosheet in a solution,
      as stated above, a nanosheet membrane can be formed merely by
      coating the substrate surface with a nanosheet solution. However,
      the thickness of a nanosheet membrane is almost determined by the
      thickness of a nanosheet in a solution and it is difficult to form
      a thick membrane. In contrast, it is possible to increase the
      thickness of a nanosheet membrane nearly in proportion to the
      repetition rate of alternate adsorption without regard to the
      existence or the polarity of electric charge on the substrate
      surface by making a substrate surface adsorb a nanosheet and the
      second material alternately.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] A third process is a process of mixing a nanosheet solution
      or nanosheets with a solution containing a substrate or melt of a
      substrate; and solidifying the mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0175] The third process does not particularly limit the material
      kind of a substrate but is suitable particularly for a process of
      dispersing nanosheets in the interior of a resin material. By
      using the process, it is possible to produce, for example, a resin
      film wherein silicon nanosheets disperse. A silicon nanosheet is
      excellent in thermal conductivity and hence a resin film wherein
      silicon nanosheets disperse has both electrical insulating
      properties and thermal conductivity. Consequently, it can be used
      as, for example, an electrical insulating material and the like
      having high heat dissipation in an electronic part and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] A nanosheet-containing composite obtained by the
      aforementioned process can be used for various applications as it
      is. Further, it may be subjected to heat treatment under
      prescribed conditions if the material of a substrate allows the
      heat treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] For example, by applying a nanosheet on the surface or in
      the interior of a substrate and thereafter heating the substrate
      at 800[deg.] C. to 1,000[deg.] C. in an inert atmosphere, it is
      possible to remove hydrogen and a hydroxyl contained in the
      silicon nanosheet. As a result, it is possible to form a crystal
      or a membrane substantially composed of only Si atoms on the
      surface or in the interior of the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Further for example, it is possible to form a crystal or a
      membrane of silica (SiO2) on the surface or in the interior of the
      substrate by applying a nanosheet on the surface or in the
      interior of a substrate and thereafter heating the substrate at
      500[deg.] C. to 1,000[deg.] C. in an oxidizing atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Next, a nanosheet aggregate according to the present
      invention and a process for producing it are explained.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] A nanosheet aggregate according to the present invention is
      obtained by aggregating nanosheets according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] In a nanosheet solution, silicon nanosheets are in the
      state of dispersing or suspending in a liquid (a solvent). As
      processes for aggregating the nanosheets, there are the following
      processes;<br>
      <br>
      [0182] (1) a process of adjusting the pH of a nanosheet solution
      to 7 to 5 and aggregating nanosheets (so called "a sol-gel
      process"),<br>
      <br>
      [0183] (2) a process of controlling the concentration of an
      electrolyte in a nanosheet solution in the range of 1 to 10 moles
      and aggregating nanosheets,<br>
      <br>
      [0184] (3) a process of heating or freeze-drying a nanosheet
      solution and thereby removing a solvent in the solution, and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] Since a silicon nanosheet has a very large two-dimensional
      anisotropy, a nanosheet aggregate obtained by aggregating the
      silicon nanosheets comprises fine particles (0.1 to 3 [mu]m in
      average diameter) and has a high surface to volume ratio (50 to
      200 m&lt;2&gt; /g). Consequently, a nanosheet aggregate can be
      used as various kinds of carriers, an absorbent, and others.
      Further, by using a nanosheet aggregate as a negative electrode
      active material of a lithium secondary battery, it is possible to
      configure the lithium secondary battery having a large capacity
      and being excellent in cyclic performance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1 1. Derivation of Weiss Type Siloxene</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0186] A nanosheet solution was produced by using CaSi2 (refer to
      FIG. 2) as a layered silicon compound. Firstly, CaSi2 powder was
      brought into contact with concentrated hydrochloric acid (12 N) at
      a rate of 100 cm&lt;3 &gt; of the latter to 1 g of the former and
      was reacted at 0[deg.] C. in an argon atmosphere (an acid
      treatment step). After the reaction for 8 hours, Weiss type
      siloxene (Si6H3(OH)3.HCl, refer to FIG. 3) of yellowish green was
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] Successively, the powder was filtered and thereafter washed
      with concentrated hydrochloric acid cooled to 0[deg.] C. in an
      argon atmosphere, and thus CaCl2 as a by-product was removed (a
      first washing step). Thereafter, the powder was further washed
      with acetone (a second washing step). 2. Exfoliation of Weiss Type
      Siloxene<br>
      <br>
      [0188] Next, Weiss type siloxene of 0.2 g was added to a sodium
      dodecyl sulfate (SDS) aqueous solution having the concentration of
      0.1 mol/dm&lt;3 &gt; and a pH of 5 or less which was adjusted with
      hydrochloric acid. By so doing, the HCl having intruded between
      silicon atom layers of the Weiss type siloxene was replaced with
      the SDS (the surfactant) and the distance between the silicon atom
      layers expanded from about 6 Ȧ to about 100 Ȧ (refer to FIGS. 3
      and 4).<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Successively, shaking was applied at the rate of about 100
      rpm for 10 days with a shaker (made by As One Corporation) (an
      exfoliation step) and the Weiss type siloxene containing the SDS
      was peeled off to a thickness of 10 nm or less, namely a thickness
      nearly equal to the thickness of a single layered silicon atom
      layer (refer to FIG. 5). Thereby, a nanosheet solution wherein
      silicon nanosheets 1 having the structure shown in FIG. 1
      dispersed was obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] In the present example, since SDS which was an anionic
      surfactant was used as a surfactant in particular, it was possible
      to replace Cl&lt;-&gt; ions among the HCl molecules which had
      intruded between silicon atom layers of a siloxene compound with
      the surfactant. Then, since the Cl&lt;-&gt; ions were replaced
      with the anionic surfactant and shaking was applied under strong
      acidic conditions of pH 5 or lower, it was possible to easily peel
      off the siloxene compound to a thickness of 10 nm or less. 3.
      Evaluation<br>
      <br>
      [0191] It was observed that, when the nanosheet solution was put
      into a beaker and irradiated with a light from one side, a Tyndall
      phenomenon intrinsic to a colloidal solution appeared. Therefore,
      it was understood that the nanosheet solution obtained in the
      present example was a colloidal solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] Further, the nanosheet solution was subjected to X ray
      diffractometry and the distance between silicon atom layers was
      measured. The result is shown in FIG. 6. From FIG. 6, it was
      understood that most of the silicon atom layers dispersed in the
      solvent with a space of 100 Ȧ or more, namely most of the silicon
      nanosheets were composed of single layered silicon atom layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] Next, the nanosheet solution was dropped on a mica, dried,
      and thereafter observed with an atomic force microscope (AFM)
      (D3100, made by Veeco Instruments Inc.). The result is shown in
      FIG. 7. From FIG. 7, it was understood that the thickness of the
      nanosheet was 0.7 to 0.8 nm and the width thereof was around 100
      nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] Next, the nanosheet solution was dropped on a copper mesh
      for observation with a transmission electron microscope (TEM)
      (made by JEOL Ltd.), dried, and thereafter observed with the TEM.
      As a result, it was found that the concentration was uniform in a
      silicon nanosheet and the thickness of the silicon nanosheet was
      very uniform.<br>
      <br>
      [0195] Next, an electron diffraction pattern of the silicon
      nanosheet was measured with a TEM apparatus (made by JEOL Ltd.).
      The result is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] As shown in FIG. 8, it was confirmed that the silicon
      nanosheet showed a diffraction pattern which was formed when a
      silicon nanosheet was irradiated with a beam from the (111)
      direction of a crystal having a face centered cubic (FCC) lattice
      structure. That is, it was understood that the silicon nanosheet
      according to the present example was a nanosheet obtained by
      peeling off a layered silicon compound comprising CaSi2 which was
      used as the starting material to form single layers (monomolecular
      layers) in the state where the (111) plane of Si in the layered
      silicon compound was maintained as it was.<br>
      <br>
      [0197] Here, in FIG. 8, the white dots show the (220) planes of a
      face centered cubic (FCC) lattice and, since the dots are hardly
      visible in the figure, the dots are indicated with the arrows for
      convenience. As shown in FIG. 8, the dots were observed at the
      positions of the apexes of a nearly regular hexagon.<br>
      <br>
      [0198] In the present example as stated above, a silicon nanosheet
      having an uniform thickness of 0.7 to 0.8 nm and comprising the
      same structure as the (111) plane of silicon, wherein the interior
      of the plane was composed of a monocrystal, could be obtained. In
      the obtained silicon nanosheet, as shown in FIG. 1, a part of the
      hydrogen of Weiss type siloxene (Si6H3(OH)3.HCl) was hydroxylated.
      Taking it into consideration that a small amount of gas was
      generated in the exfoliation step, it was estimated that the
      hydroxylation was caused by such reaction between the Weiss type
      siloxene and water in the exfoliation step as represented by, for
      example, the expression (2) below,<br>
      Si6H3(OH)3+[delta]H2O-&gt;Si6H3-[delta](OH)3+[delta]+[delta]H2
      (0≤[delta]≤3) (2).<br>
      <br>
      [0199] Next, the fluorescence spectrum of the nanosheet solution
      was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FP-6600, made
      by JASCO Corporation). A fluorescence spectrum when the excitation
      wavelength was set at 400 nm and the solid concentration (the
      concentration of silicon nanosheets) was set at 0.5% by weight is
      shown in FIG. 9. In FIG. 9, the horizontal axis represents a
      wavelength (nm) and the vertical axis represents a strength.
      Further, in FIG. 9, the measurement result of the fluorescence
      spectrum is shown with the solid line and the waveforms obtained
      by the waveform separation of the measurement result (the solid
      line) are shown with the dotted lines.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] From FIG. 9, it was understood that:<br>
      (1) when a silicon nanosheet according to the present example was
      irradiated with light of the excitation wavelength of 400 nm, a
      fluorescence having the wavelengths of 450 to 600 nm was emitted;
      and<br>
      (2) the fluorescence spectrum could be separated into three types
      of waveforms having the peak wavelengths of 465±5 nm, 505±5 nm,
      and 560±5 nm, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] Further, although it is not shown in the figure, when the
      concentration of the solid content in a nanosheet solution was
      diluted to 0.05% by weight, the strength of the peak of the
      waveform having the peak wavelength of 465±5 nm increased. The
      increase of the peak strength can be explained as the quantum size
      effect of the silicon nanosheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] As stated above, a silicon nanosheet according to the
      present example emits a green fluorescence comprising three types
      of lights having peaks in a visible light region. By making use of
      the phenomenon, such a silicon nanosheet and a nanosheet solution
      wherein the silicon nanosheets are dispersed or suspended can be
      used for an indicating material and others.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0205] Following the same procedure as described in the item 1 of
      Example 1, Weiss type siloxene (Si6H3(OH)3.HCl) was produced.
      Successively, the Weiss type siloxene of 0.2 g was added to a
      tetrabutyl ammonium (TBAOH, a cationic surfactant) aqueous
      solution. In this case, the concentration of the tetrabutyl
      ammonium aqueous solution was set at the same mol concentration as
      the Cl in the Weiss type siloxene (Si6H3(OH)3.HCl), namely 0.1
      mol/dm&lt;3&gt; . The solution was shaken for 10 days at the rate
      of about 100 rpm with a shaker (made by As One Corporation) and
      resultantly a nanosheet solution was obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0206] In the case of the nanosheet solution obtained in the
      present example too, in the same way as Example 1, it was
      confirmed that silicon nanosheets nearly comprising single layered
      silicon atom layers dispersed in a solvent and had a peak in the
      visible light region in the measurement of a fluorescence
      spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3 1. Production of a Nanosheet-Containing Composite</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0207] Following the procedure below, as shown in FIGS. 10 and 11,
      a nanosheet-containing composite 5 wherein three resin layers 53
      and three nanosheet layers 55 were laminated alternately on the
      surface of a substrate 51 was produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] Firstly, a quartz glass substrate 20 mm*20 mm in area and 2
      mm in thickness was prepared as the substrate. Further, a
      nanosheet solution prepared in Example 1 and a polymer solution
      containing PDADMAC and NaCl were prepared. In the polymer
      solution, the concentration of the PDADMAC was 1 mg/mL and the
      concentration of the NaCl was 0.5 M. Furthermore, water was
      prepared for washing.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] Successively, the glass substrate was immersed in the
      polymer solution and dried, and thus a resin layer comprising the
      PDADMAC was formed on the surface of the glass substrate (a resin
      layer forming step). The glass substrate was washed with water and
      dried (a washing step). Thereafter, the glass substrate was
      immersed in the nanosheet solution and dried again, and thereby a
      nanosheet layer comprising a silicon nanosheet was formed on the
      resin layer (a nanosheet layer forming step). After the glass
      substrate was washed again with water, the resin layer forming
      step, the washing step, and the nanosheet forming step were
      further applied repeatedly. 2. Evaluation<br>
      <br>
      [0210] The fluorescence spectrum of the obtained
      nanosheet-containing composite was measured with a fluorescence
      spectrophotometer (FP-6600, made by JASCO Corporation). The
      fluorescence spectrum obtained when the excitation wavelength was
      set at 450 nm is shown in FIG. 12. As shown in FIG. 12, in the
      case of the nanosheet-containing composite of the present example,
      the peak was observed at the wavelength of 540±5 nm. That is, it
      was found that the nanosheet-containing composite of the present
      example emitted fluorescence in the visible light range.<br>
      <br>
      [0211] Further, when the nanosheet-containing composite was
      subjected to heat treatment at 800[deg.] C. to 1,000[deg.] C. in a
      vacuum (10&lt;-5 &gt; Pa or lower), hydrogen and a hydroxyl in the
      silicon nanosheets were removed and a silicon membrane could be
      formed on the glass substrate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0212] A nanosheet solution produced in Example 1 was freeze-dried
      and thus a nanosheet aggregate was obtained. Specifically, a
      nanosheet solution adjusted to 0.5% by weight was frozen with
      liquid nitrogen and, by sucking the nanosheet solution with a
      rotary pump, the solvent was removed gradually. The nanosheet
      aggregate comprised fine particles (0.1 to 0.3 [mu]m) and had a
      high surface to volume ratio (50 to 200 m&lt;2&gt; /g).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0213] A nanosheet solution was produced following the same
      procedure as Example 1 except that YbSi2 (refer to FIG. 13) was
      used as the layered silicon compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0214] It was confirmed that, in the obtained nanosheet solution,
      silicon nanosheets 7 each of which contained a silicon atom layer
      75 having a nearly flat structure as shown in FIG. 14 dispersed in
      the solvent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0215] Following the same procedure as described in the item 1 of
      Example 1, a nanosheet solution was produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] Successively, a siloxene compound of 0.2 g was added to an
      ethanol solution of P-1,2,3 (block copolymer,
      HO(CH2CH2O)20(CH2CH(CH3)O)70(CH2CH2O)20H) the concentration of
      which was 0.01 mol/dm&lt;3&gt; , and shaken hard (an exfoliation
      step). As a result, a dark brown suspension wherein silicon
      nanosheets dispersed was obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0217] When the suspension was put in a beaker and irradiated with
      light from one side, a Tyndall phenomenon intrinsic to a colloidal
      solution appeared. More specifically, it was understood that the
      suspension was a colloidal solution wherein silicon nanosheets
      suspended.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] As stated above, it was understood that, even when a
      neutral surfactant was used as a surfactant, it was possible to
      produce a colloidal solution wherein silicon nanosheets dispersed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7 1. Production of a Nanosheet Solution</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0219] CaSi2 (0.1 g) was dispersed in a solvent comprising the
      mixture of propylamine (2 mL) and distilled water (8 mL). The
      mixture was subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 120[deg.] C.
      for 3 days in a beaker made of tetrafluoroethylene. Thereafter,
      unreacted materials were centrifugally separated at the number of
      revolutions of 10,000 rpm and the supernatant liquid was
      fractionated. 2. Evaluation of a Structure<br>
      <br>
      [0220] FIG. 15 shows an electron diffraction pattern on the planes
      of a silicon nanosheet contained in the obtained nanosheet
      solution. From FIG. 15, it was understood that the spots appeared
      in the form of a regular hexagon and had hexagonally rotational
      symmetry. The obtained spots appeared at the positions of 0.215 nm
      and 0.124 nm and were indexed as (220) and (440), respectively.
      Assuming that the diffraction spots were based on the ≤111&gt;
      incidence, the spacing of lattice planes was about 10% larger in
      comparison with the values of bulk Si (0.192 nm in the case of Si
      (220) and 0.096 nm in the case of Si (440)).<br>
      <br>
      [0221] Further, an end of a silicon nanosheet sometimes uprose and
      the shape of the lamination of the sheets was precisely observed
      from the end portion. A TEM photograph of an end of a silicon
      nanosheet is shown in FIG. 16. From FIG. 16, it was understood
      that the observed nanosheet had a layered structure comprising 20
      to 30 layers. The distance between layers was 0.30 nm in the
      actual measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [0222] A result of EDX analysis of a silicon nanosheet is shown in
      FIG. 17. In FIG. 17, the counts of C and Cu were caused by the
      grid during the TEM observation. From FIG. 17, it was understood
      that, besides Si, oxygen was included in the nanosheet.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] From the above results, the silicon nanosheet obtained in
      the present example could be indexed on the basis of a hexagonal
      system, and the lattice constants were determined as a=0.43 nm and
      c=0.30 nm. On the other hand, CaSi2 as the starting material was
      indexed as a=0.38 nm and c=0.31 nm on the basis of the hexagonal
      system. This showed that the error was too large to regard the
      silicon nanosheet obtained in the present example as comprising
      conventional sp&lt;3 &gt; orbits. Then assuming that the silicon
      nanosheet comprised sp&lt;2 &gt; obits like graphite (a planar
      structure) and the distance of Si-Si bond was 0.25 nm, the lattice
      constants of the hexagonal system were a=0.43 nm and c=0.30 nm and
      the result well coincided with the actual measurement. Taking the
      result together with the results of FIGS. 15 and 16 into
      consideration, it was estimated that the silicon nanosheet
      obtained in the present example had a structure formed by
      laminating silicon atom layers each of which had a planar
      structure as shown in FIG. 18B. 3. Evaluation of Photophysical
      Properties<br>
      <br>
      [0224] A nanosheet solution containing silicon nanosheets by 1% by
      weight was subjected to UV-vis measurement. The result is shown in
      FIG. 19. From FIG. 19, in the case of the silicon nanosheet
      obtained in the present example, the bandgap obtained from the
      absorption edge of the rising portion was 3.6 eV. The value meant
      the expression of quantum effect. More specifically, the value
      supported the fact that the nanosheets dispersing in the solution
      were nanosized silicon of 1 nm or less.<br>
      <br>

      present invention have been described in detail. However, the
      present invention is not limited to the above embodiments at all

        <b>Improvements in the preparation of mono-silane</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Siloxene Si6 O3 H6 is prepared as a grey powder by reacting a
      metal disilicide with an aqueous-alcoholic solution of mineral
      acid. Silicides specified are calcium, barium, and strontium
      silicide. Acids specified are hydrochloric, sulphuric, and acetic
      acid. Alcohols specified are methyl, ethyl, n- or iso-propyl, or
      n-, iso- or tert-butyl alcohol. 90-97% of alcohol may be present
      in the reaction mixture. Acidic hydrogen to metal ratios of 2-18
      to 1 are specified. The temperature of reaction may be 0-95 DEG C.
      but is usually room temperature. The reaction mixture may be
      allowed to stand for 17 hours. The siloxene may be separated by
      filtration, washed with ethanol, and vacuum dried at 60 DEG C.
      Monosilane is produced by reacting siloxene, preferably prepared
      as described above, with liquid or gaseous ammonia, in a
      non-oxidizing atmosphere and at a temperature of at least -33 DEG
      C. Argon or helium may be employed as a carrier for gaseous
      ammonia which may be at a temperature of 350 DEG C. The system may
      be evacuated, or an inert gas atmosphere employed, when using
      liquid ammonia. In order to use liquid ammonia, increased pressure
      may be employed and/or up to 30% of ammonium chloride, bromide, or
      iodide may be added to the reaction mixture. The monosilane which
      is evolved together with ammonia and hydrogen may be condensed
      together with the ammonia in a liquid &nbsp;<br>
      EXAMPLE I 125<br>
      <br>
      Siloxene was prepared by adding 6 7 grams of calcium disilicide (
      0 05 mol) to a solution of 41.5 milliliters of concentrated
      hydrochloric acid ( 0 50 mol) in 1000 milliliters of ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      This corresponds to an acidic hydrogen to 130 831,289 silane which
      comprises reacting siloxene with ammonia in a non-oxidising
      atmosphere at a 60 temperature of at least -33 C and recovering
      the resulting gaseous mono-silane from the reaction mixture.<br>
