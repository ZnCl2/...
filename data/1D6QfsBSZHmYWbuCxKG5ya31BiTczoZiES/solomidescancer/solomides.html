      Jean Solomides , born Yangos Solomides, the 28 February 1911 , In
      Cyprus, is a French doctor , researcher and biologist of Cypriot
      origin, who worked at the Institut Pasteur from 1938 to 1947. He
      died in France, 28 May 1979 .<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biography</b><br>
      <br>
      Jean Solomides comes to France to study, physics, chemistry,
      natural sciences. He graduated from the Sorbonne with a Bachelor
      of Science degree, and in 1938 obtained a degree in medicine.
      Research fellow at the CNRS , he is seconded to the Institut
      Pasteur and works on tuberculosis . Detached in Toulouse during
      the war, he passed a degree in natural sciences. With his teacher
      Frédéric Van Deinse 1 , he studied tubercle bacilli and the
      effects of oils, fats, glycerin on bacilli in the organism of
      laboratory animals. At the time of the Liberation, he was a
      trainee at the CNRS and then a researcher in 1945. He discovered
      in 1947 that synthetic peroxidases (oxidation catalysts) destroy,
      by oxidation, cultures of tuberculous bacilli, but also cancer
      cells by Selectively fixing on their membrane. On March 4, 1948,
      he made a communication on his method to the French Society of
      Microbiology, published in the Annals of the Institut Pasteur and
      in more than sixty other scientific publications.<br>
      <br>
      In 1949, he obtained French citizenship for acts of resistance .
      In the same year, he cured his father with an inoperable liver
      tumor for which the Cypriot doctors call him condemned. Solomides
      sends to Cyprus ampoules of iodized distillate of cod liver oil in
      solution to treat his father. Three weeks later, the doctors
      noticed to their surprise that the tumor had disappeared [citation
      needed] . His father is completely cured 2 .<br>
      <br>
      The cure of his father arouses negative reactions at the Institut
      Pasteur [ref. Required] . Indeed, this healing, its experiments on
      glycerin that have proved that the artificial immunity is
      transient and "that question the usefulness of vaccinations which
      make up the majority of the resources of the Pasteur Institute",
      are worried. He was dismissed from the Institute at the end of
      1949 , against the will of Professor Van Deinse 3 . He then
      installed his laboratory in the cellar of his pavilion at Sceaux
      with the help of a doctor. In 1951 and 1952, he obtained the MA
      for Citral-Urethane and Geranyl 4 , against bronchitis, eczema,
      allergies, and as analgesics in the treatment of cancer. In
      Belgium, the drug is tested and reimbursed by the Social Security.<br>
      <br>
      In 1955, Georges de Caunes invited him to French radio-television
      with two or three patients. As a result of this emission, many
      patients contact him in order to try this treatment much less
      heavy than the ordinary treatment. In October 1956, Solomides
      created a popularization magazine, Victories on Cancer , and the
      World League for Cancer Chemotherapy , the League later became the
      sick Human Rights League , and the magazine became Remedies-News .<br>
      <br>
      His life then becomes a series of struggles to officially
      recognize his discoveries. His cancer drugs do not receive AMM
      although they legally cure the sick with doctors collaborators,
      and he has to face many lawsuits for "illegal practice of
      medicine" 5 .<br>
      <br>
      Despite the relentlessness of the Seine Medical Doctors' Chamber
      of the Ministry of Health, thousands of patients have been cured
      or improved, thanks to their findings 6 , 7 , 8 9 .<br>
      <br>
      He died exhausted , in May 1979, at 68 years, from a pulmonary
      embolism .<br>
      <br>
      He was publicly defended by the artist Philippe Druillet in
      Charlie Hebdo (June-July 1979) 10 .<br>

      of Dr. Jean Solomides (Le Hameau, Paris).<br>
      <br>
      "The potion of Doctor Solomides", Sept to Eight of Sunday 15 June
      2008, on TF1, 18:50 ,<br>
      <br>
      Yangos Solomides was born in Cyprus on February 28, 1911, with
      British nationality. [A: 85]<br>
      <br>
      He chose to study medicine in France, in order to do research
      afterwards. [A: 86]<br>
      <br>
      In 1929, he made his PCN (undergraduate degree in physics,
      chemistry, natural sciences) in Montpellier, and in 1930 his first
      year of medicine. [A: 86]<br>
      <br>
      He prepares a science degree at the Sorbonne, which will allow him
      to access teaching or research. [A: 86]<br>
      <br>
      In 1937 and 1938, he acquired the certificates of biological
      chemistry, mineralogy and general physiology, these three
      certificates constituting a license [A: 86-87].<br>
      <br>
      On November 24, 1938, he passed his Doctor of Medicine thesis at
      the University of Paris [A: 87].<br>
      <br>
      In 1939, he obtained the diploma of bacteriology of the Faculty of
      medicine of Paris [A: 87].<br>
      <br>
      He worked at the Institut Pasteur, in 1938 on tuberculosis, and in
      1939 and 1940 on the bacillus of Koch [A: 87]. He is a researcher
      at the CNRS, seconded for eight years to the Institut Pasteur [A:
      80-81].<br>
      <br>
      During the war, he was assigned to residence in Toulouse, and
      obtained in 1943 and 1944 certificates of general chemistry,
      physical chemistry and general botany at the University of
      Toulouse, and was thus licensed in natural sciences. [A: 87]<br>
      <br>
      From 1940 to 1944, in collaboration with his master Frédéric Van
      Deinse, head of the BCG department at the Institut Pasteur, he is
      studying tubercle bacilli, their effects on rabbits and guinea
      pigs, oils and Fatty substances on the bacilli and on the organism
      of experimental animals, for example on the sensitizing or on the
      contrary immunizing properties of glycerine. [A: 87]<br>
      <br>
      On the liberation of France, he became a trainee at CNRS and then
      researcher in 1945. [A: 88]<br>
      <br>
      He sells to the Walter laboratories an ointment, Gadistol, based
      on distillate of cod liver oil, against eczema, skin cancers and
      especially radiodermitis (precancerous skin lesions, caused by
      X-rays or gamma). [A: 88]<br>
      <br>
      In 1947 or 1948 he discovered that synthetic peroxidase (oxidation
      catalysts) destroyed cultures of tubercle bacilli by oxidizing
      them, but also cancerous tumors on the membrane from which they
      selectively bind. [A: 57: 179-180] They also allow other harmful
      substances to act more selectively on cancer cells. Thus, the male
      hormone used against breast and uterine cancers causes less facial
      hirsutism and hoarseness of voice. [A: 61-62]<br>
      <br>
      Synthetic physiatrists are used to prevent tumor development, to
      reabsorb, to operate, and to prevent metastasis. [A: 49] They also
      allow the patient to reduce his suffering [A: 54], but also to
      resume his bad habits, thus compromising his chances of recovery
      [A: 51].<br>
      <br>
      On March 4, 1948, he made a communication on his procedure to the
      French Society of Microbiology, published in the "Annales de
      l'Institut Pasteur". [A: 59]<br>
      <br>
      In May 1949, for acts of resistance during the war, he acquired
      French nationality. [A: 100 &amp; 188]<br>
      <br>
      At the end of 1949, he learned that his father had a huge liver
      tumor. He sends Famagusta iodized distillate of cod liver oil in
      solution [A: 90] giving advice for treatment and injection.
      Doctors are amazed to see the tumor disappear in three weeks [A:
      91].<br>
      <br>
      The news aroused jealousy at the Pasteur Institute, where it was
      reproached for its zeal in work and its experiments on glycerin,
      proving that artificial immunity was transient, and which
      questioned the usefulness of vaccinations which constituted The
      majority of the resources of the Institut Pasteur. [A: 91-92]<br>
      <br>
      Louis Aublant, Secretary General of the Pasteur Institute, asked
      him to leave. [A: 92]<br>
      <br>
      He is hired by the Institut Gustave-Roussy de Villejuif
      (specialized in cancer), by Professor Charles Oberling, and
      licensed from his first experimentation, after three weeks. [A:
      93-95]<br>
      <br>
      He is refused the service of Professor Raoul Kourilsky,
      specializing in tuberculosis at the Saint-Antoine hospital; At the
      service of Dr. Jean-Paul Sisley, of the Laboratoire des Corps Gras
      de Bellevue; At the service of Dr Chadourne, director of the
      sanatorium of L'Haÿ-les-Roses; At the service of Professor Aubel.
      It is written to him, strangely seen his diplomas, that we have
      enough lab laborers. His wife, Michelle, suspected that the
      Pasteur Institute was blocking his career, telephoned the
      successor of Dr. Van Deinse to the head of the tuberculosis
      department, posing as the director of a laboratory that wanted to
      know what " He thinks of Solomides who has just presented himself
      to her: "Oh, you know, he never broke three legs to a duck," he
      replied. [A: 95-96]<br>
      <br>
      He was informed that he was dismissed from the CNRS in June 1950
      with six months' notice, without being able to receive him. The
      president of the CNRS finally writes that he can not reveal to him
      under what conditions the Commission of the medicine decided its
      dismissal. [A: 97]<br>
      <br>
      He treats a neighbor with a stomach cancer, whom a surgeon, after
      opening, has closed again without operating because of the size of
      the tumor. [A: 96-97]<br>
      <br>
      He installed his laboratory in the cellar of his pavilion at
      Sceaux, 13 rue de la Marne, with the help of a doctor who lent him
      30,000 francs.<br>
      <br>
      Because of his successes, five to ten patients a day present
      themselves. [A: 98]<br>
      <br>
      Having advised a patient not to carry out an operation, the
      surgeon has him summoned by the county council of the Ordre des
      médecins. Solomides not appearing in his disciplinary committee,
      the council complains about the illegal practice of medicine. [A:
      102]<br>
      <br>
      He is summoned by the investigating judge Ferdinand Gollety and
      the police raided his home. [A: 103] In 1953, an amnesty ended the
      case with a dismissal. [A: 104]<br>
      <br>
      On March 13, 1951, he made a communication to the Society of
      Comparative Pathology on some aliphatic (hexanal, heptanal, octal
      and citral) aldehydes (alcohols dehydrogenated) as a treatment for
      eczema and analgesics in cancer. The president of the company, M.
      Gastinel, Professor of Microbiology, goes on to say that it is
      impossible to cure eczema and especially cancer. Dr. Grillot, the
      company's secretary, said: "You were unanimously elected as a
      Correspondent of the Society of Pathology." A month later, a
      letter informs him that his communication can not be published,
      and he sends his resignation. The paper is published by a medical
      journalist who attended the 1951 session of the Journal of the
      American Medical Association under the title "The therapeutic
      applications of œnanthol". [A 107]<br>
      <br>
      In 1951, "La France médicale", which had published its previous
      communications, refuses to do so, as well as "Nature" in England,
      "Experientia" in Switzerland, for lack of space. [A: 108]<br>
      <br>
      In 1951 and 1952, he obtained marketing authorization for
      Citral-Urethane and Geranyl, two oils of plant origin with
      ether-oxide of olyethylene glycol. Visas were obtained in six
      months, against bronchitis, eczema, allergies, as analgesics in
      cancer. The Geranyl was experimented in Villejuif. A small
      laboratory, Biostabilex, operates visas until 1972. [A: 105]<br>
      <br>
      From 1952, he decided to publish the "Annual Review of
      chemotherapy and prophylaxis of cancer" which will make it known
      by many doctors. [A: 109: 110]<br>
      <br>
      In 1952 and 1953 he wrote to the French National League Against
      Cancer in order to ask for a subsidy which he refused, since it
      would enable him to provide free ampoules of synthetic peroxidases
      for testing in their services. [A: 108-109]<br>
      <br>
      On 19 December 1954, at a press conference given at the Essec
      Prize, founded by the Catholic Institute and the French League
      against Cancer, in order to encourage young researchers, Solomides
      was surprised at the lack of curiosity The Institut de Villejuif
      with respect to its medicines which, in some cases of cancer, give
      good results and which always lead to sedation of pain. Professor
      Pierre Denoix, director of the Gustave-Roussy Institute in
      Villejuif, replied that he was embarrassed but polite, that we
      could talk about this elsewhere. The Abbe Donjon, director of the
      Catholic Institute, did not let Solomides leave the room. As there
      are journalists, and in particular Jacques-Louis Tissier,
      President of the Union of French Journalists and Foreign Press
      Correspondents, who asks for explanations, a conference is
      organized on 24 February 1955 for the learned societies. A
      half-dozen patients came to testify. The next day, Georges de
      Caunes invited him to the radio-television studios with two or
      three patients. [A: 114]<br>
      <br>
      From then on, a cohort of patients telephoned him, wrote him,
      waited in front of his house for tens of meters, in order to try a
      much less mutilating treatment. [A 117]<br>
      <br>
      The Ordre des médecins asked the Radio-Télévision to no longer
      communicate the address of Solomides to the patients who requested
      it: they had to be directed to Curie, Villejuif, the Hartmann
      Center. The President of the Order, M. Piédelievre, who had passed
      the examinations to Solomides, having granted him the diploma of
      doctor of medicine, reminds television that there is no cancer
      treatment other than surgery And radiotherapy. [A: 117-118]<br>
      <br>
      In April 1955, the Official Bulletin of the Chamber of Medical
      Officers of the Seine (no. 4) published an article entitled
      "French Radio-Television in the service of charlatans". [A: 118]
      Solomides assigns the ballot for defamation claiming ten million
      francs in damages. [A: 120-121]<br>
      <br>
      Pushed by the Trade Union Chamber, the Ministry of Public Health
      files a complaint in illegal practice of medicine and another for
      illegal practice of pharmacy. [A 121]<br>
      <br>
      Two police inspectors are sent and Solomides is reconvened by the
      investigating judge Gollety, with whom he becomes a friend. [A
      121]<br>
      <br>
      In Belgium, the drug is tested and reimbursed by the Social
      Security. [A: 126]<br>
      <br>
      A large Cuban laboratory pays a million francs for research
      expenses, requests a contract to have exclusivity for South
      America, and then ceases to show when Cuban officials have
      requested information from the Institut Pasteur. [A: 126-127]<br>
      <br>
      On January 31, 1956, Solomides gave a lecture on synthetic
      peroxidases, with many patients healed, at the Sorbonne Geological
      Amphitheater. [A 129]<br>
      <br>
      On April 12, 1956, the conference, which was to be the occasion to
      publish a pamphlet presenting a hundred new cases of cures,
      scheduled for April 14, 1956 at the same place, is, according to
      M. Pérez, dean of the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, By the
      Ministries of National Education and Public Health, on the
      intervention of the National Order of Physicians. In fact, a
      junior public health official communicated the prohibition to the
      dean without a ban on both departments. The conference is made
      before the learned societies. [A: 129-130]<br>
      <br>
      In October 1956, Solomides published an outreach journal,
      "Victories on Cancer," and created the World League for Cancer
      Chemotherapy. [A 131]<br>
      <br>
      Of the patients sent home by oncologists who could do nothing for
      them, Jean Solomides saved 14%; On those who follow his treatment
      before any other, 70% are cured, double the conventional
      treatment. In fact, by reacting surface antigens on cancer cells,
      synthetic physiatrists added to chemotherapy increase efficacy by
      30% [B: 41].<br>
      <br>
      - On January 24, 1957, the trial began at the 16th Correctional
      Chamber of the Seine, under the presidency of Mr. Mille.
      Solomides, a victim of a heart malaise, is defended by Mr. Hayot.
      [A: 134] Testify Mr Brillault, president of the civil court in
      Bordeaux, and a young sales representative with laryngeal cancer
      who were able to preserve their voice without surgery or radiation
      therapy. This allowed Mr. Brillault to chair new hearings. Dr.
      Boisseau, former director of the Pasteur Institute of Brazzaville,
      then of the Pasteur Institute of Athens, retired physician
      colonel, and then head of microbiology department at
      Rhone-Poulenc, commander Of the Legion of Honor, testifies that
      one of her relatives, who must have died of a breast tumor for two
      years according to the diagnoses of the specialists, is in good
      health thanks to the medicine of Solomides [A: 136- 137]. Dr.
      Mamonni, a treating physician, testified that he had rescued his
      twenty-year-old niece, <br>
      condemned according to Curie surgeons, and said that, in addition
      to the increase in cures, Use of morphine. He adds that a
      physician who is aware of the Solomides treatment and who refuses
      to try it is a criminal. [A: 137]. M. Mignon deposited a copy of
      the letter of Professor Denoix, in which the director of the
      Gustave-Roussy Institute pronounced the death of his wife in the
      near future; And a duplicate of the letter of Dr. M. of the Foch
      Foundation, in which he affirms two years later that the
      intestinal tumor has disappeared [A: 139]. According to article 63
      of the Penal Code, Mr.&nbsp; Hayot pleads the obligation to rescue
      persons in danger [A: 141]. On January 31, the court sentenced
      Solomides to a minimum of 10,000 francs for conditional fines
      because he noted the cure of cancers that allowed Solomides to
      benefit from "the broadest extenuating circumstances"; And the
      accusers only benefit from 1 symbolic F, and not from the 500,000
      and 100,000 francs they claimed. The medical bodies appealed, and
      the trial of 9 June 1960 confirmed the first judgment. [A:
      141-142].<br>
      <br>
      On October 10, 1957, the unlawful trial of pharmacy was pleaded,
      as only three of its synthetic physiatrists obtained the visa from
      the Ministry of Public Health [A: 148, 151]. Solomides explains
      that he obtained the visas as long as it was eczema and
      bronchitis, but not for cancer, because of the partiality of the
      Gustave-Roussy and Curie institutes, and the absence of
      counter-expertise [A: 152]. He refers to the reimbursement of the
      SPs in Belgium, their authorization in Switzerland and for two
      days in Greece [A: 153]. Baroness Héraud quotes Professor
      Oberling's letter, which states that "the ideas of Solomides do
      not correspond to the present state of science" so as not to
      involve him in Villejuif, and the letter of Dr. Lavedan, head of
      the department Anti-cancer drug of Curie, which says without
      explanation that all the leaders of the anti-cancer centers refuse
      the request for subsidy made by Dr. Solomides, unanimously and in
      the name of the French National League against cancer [A: 154] .
      Expertise is sought [A: 154]; Some experts recuse themselves; The
      results are published after two years and the illegal trial of
      pharmacy continues in February 1961 [A: 157].<br>
      <br>
      - Laboratory G ..., producer of the male hormone against breast
      cancer, refuses to produce its medicines to obtain a visa because
      it fears that its sales fall because of the opinion of doctors of
      the major centers. Solomides decides to create his pharmaceutical
      laboratory, Sceaux-Pharma, in order to obtain the visas [A: 160].
      On November 24, 1957, Solomides inaugurated his institute near his
      home, in the presence of Van Deinse, his former teacher, Boisseau,
      former director of the Pasteur Institutes of Brazzaville and
      Athens, many doctors; A Greek delegation led by Dr. Katsafados,
      chief surgeon of the Tzanion Hospital in Piraeus, President of the
      Anti-Cancer Centers of Greece, deputy, former Minister of Public
      Health, and Dr. Katsaniotis, Director of Public Assistance of
      'Athens; A Belgian delegation led by pharmacist Tack who heads the
      Solomidès Institute of Belgium. [A 148]<br>
      <br>
      His World League for Cancer Chemotherapy becomes the sick Human
      Rights League, and the magazine "Victories on Cancer becomes"
      Remedies-News "[A: 161]<br>
      <br>
      In November 1958, stress caused a relapse of intestinal
      tuberculosis which he had in his youth. [A: 162] He is being
      treated with the Friedmann vaccine, the only curative vaccine and
      the most effective vaccine against tuberculosis, used in forty-six
      countries and not authorized in France [A: 163].<br>
      <br>
      On July 23, 1960, representatives of the judiciary searched at
      Sceaux. [A 163]<br>
      <br>
      On February 2, 1961 the trial for the illegal practice of pharmacy
      resumes [A: 167]. Solomides challenges the accusation that he does
      not manufacture standardized "proprietary medicines", but "secret
      remedies" in the course of experimentation, without the control of
      a pharmacist, as is the case at the Institut Pasteur . The iodized
      PS, PS 4A for example, is a progress, and of all the formulas
      tested, only a dozen have been conserved, against five diseases:
      cancers, multiple sclerosis, asthma and eczema. [A: 168, 305] He
      rejects the report of the five experts who selected only 26 of the
      80 cure cases. They deny any benefit of the PS, conclude to
      misdiagnosis made by specialists like Pr Delarue and Pr Brux
      whenever healing is impossible with the conventional treatment, or
      they claim that a biopsy could heal the whole Cancer; They
      attributed, for example, the cure of Nicol's uterine cancer to
      curettage which was not a biopsy [A: 170-172]. The experts are
      absent and there are no prosecution witnesses [A: 173]. Several
      testimonies and diagnoses prove healings which were made without
      the amputations (legs, breast) prescribed by classical medicine
      [A: 174; 183].<br>
      <br>
      At the second hearing on 9 March, the experts did not want to be
      present [A: 186].<br>
      <br>
      At the third hearing on April 27, the suspicion expressed
      scandalized loudly of sick patients and Michelle Solomides who was
      expelled. [A: 187-193]<br>
      <br>
      The verdict of May 25 does not recognize extenuating
      circumstances: the sentence is of 10,000 new francs in fine, 2,000
      francs to the civil parties, plus costs [A: 194].<br>
      <br>
      Four trials will follow, leaving Solomides without prosecution
      until a few months in 1975 [A: 200].<br>
      <br>
      Having renounced his own illness in 1963, Solomides urged Dr.
      Persâtre, who was accused by the College of Physicians of
      violating section 21 of the Code of Conduct, because he would give
      consultations in commercial premises, and He was sentenced to one
      year's suspension of the right to practice medicine [A: 203].
      Having opened a dispensary outside his institute, along with Drs.
      Persâtre and Nahon, another police search took place on June 2,
      1965, prompted by a new complaint from the Ordre des médecins.
      Patient records and visa applications are seized. [A: 204] The two
      doctors are also prosecuted under Article L-372 of the Public
      Health Code for illegally practicing medicine for working with
      Solomides and for illegal practice of pharmacy for prescribing PS;
      But none of the other prescribing doctors whose letters were
      seized, including Dr. Albert Schweitzer (Nobel Peace Prize), was
      prosecuted [A: 205-207]. Persâtre is struck out for life and Nahon
      suspended for two years [A: 208]. Nahon is also sued for
      "non-personal advertising" for publishing in the "Remedies" review
      observations on PS cures in patients deemed incurable, as if it
      were prohibited by the Code of Ethics for physicians to publish
      his observations in Of medical journals [A: 208]. Nahon went
      abroad and Persâtre became a medical visitor and died of despair
      before the 1972 trial. [A: 210] The Presidents of the League of
      Human Rights Sick, MM. Ayoul and Massiou [A: 210] are prosecuted
      for illegal practice of pharmacy, and the association is
      dissolved. * The Scout Center for Biological Research (CSRB) is
      created so that Gustave-Roussy or Curie do not own it. [A: 216]
      Inaugurated on 7 May 1965 to support the application for visas
      through care and clinical trials, the Jean-Jaurès Street medical
      center closed on 1 September 1966 [A: 216]. On April 4, 1968, the
      court acknowledged the argument of the CSRB counsel sought to
      dissolve, alleging that the center was blamed for being illegal,
      whereas his activity was precisely to obtain an authorization Of
      medicines. [A 216]<br>
      <br>
      - On 15 December 1955, Solomides signed a contract with a Belgian
      shipowner, Oïdtmann, [A: 220] who at the 1955 press conference
      understood the value of synthetic peroxidases and claimed to
      obtain Belgian pharmaceutical visas quickly To its relations [A:
      218]. On December 21, 1961, Oïdtmann filed a complaint for fraud,
      with as a lawyer, Mr. Piédelièvre, the son of the President of the
      Order who stated on television in 1955 that only surgery and
      radiotherapy were effective against cancer [ A: 219]. Solomides
      was heard by the police, then by Justice Perez in 1962 [A: 219].
      On October 26, 1966, five years after the complaint, Roussel J.
      charged him in this case [A: 220]. The investigating judge and the
      prosecutor, Mr Tachella, unlawfully added to the file the findings
      of the appraisals and amnestied verdicts in February 1962 [A:
      219], because they found no expert who wanted to sign a false
      report; Mr. Tachella writes: "In view of the difficulties
      encountered by the investigating magistrate in the search for
      experts, those who have been sought by the judge recusing
      alternately, the civil party then decides to admit to the case
      file two reports submitted in other instances." [A: 221].<br>
      <br>
      In 1967, Oïdtmann died; His family is persuaded to resume the
      complaint [A: 226]. At the first hearing before the Twelfth
      Correctional Chamber on November 25, 1969, Solomides' counsel, Mr.
      Beyssade, pleaded the limitation period, which the court held in
      its verdict of January 13, 1970 [A: 222-223]. The prosecutor
      appealed, which took place on 14 November 1970 before the Ninth
      Chamber of the Court of Appeal [A: 223]. <br>
      <br>
      The Advocate General, who admitted the limitation period for the
      first three years, asked whether there were any fraudulent acts
      after 1958. [A: 223] With the agreement of the Court of Cassation,
      experts Roger Le Breton and Pinta can testify. [A: 223] <br>
      <br>
      On 30 January 1971, the case was finally decided on the merits.
      Solomidès proves with false experience that the experiments were
      false [A: 223-224] <br>
      <br>
      Me Piédelièvre considers that the sending to Oïdtmann of the
      "Annual Journal of Cancer Physiotherapy and Chemotherapy" and
      "Victories on Cancer" was a fraud for Mr Pasturel, considers that
      there are some very interesting articles, in particular one by Dr
      Katsafados, former Minister of Health in Greece. [A: 225] <br>
      <br>
      Pasturel insisted on the very advantageous conditions for Oïdtmann
      in order to launch the PS, and he abandoned the accusation, which
      he had asked to be tried on the merits. Piédelièvre protested [A:
      225]. President Fonade said to Solomides: "I knew you already in
      the press, because a few years ago, we were a renowned but
      contested personality, it was at the time of your trial and I
      apologize for alluding to Amnesty trials, and I must admit that
      most of the articles were favorable to you. " [A: 226] <br>
      <br>
      Mr. Beyssade argued that even if Solomides had been mistaken about
      the effectiveness of the PSs, there would be no scam because there
      is neither staging nor intention to deceive. The verdict of 20
      February 1971, the innocent Solomides of fraud and charlatanism,
      acknowledges the prescription and condemns the Oddtmanns to the
      costs [A: 226].<br>
      <br>
      On February 12, 1964, scandalized by a severe judicial verdict and
      then by the banning of a lecture by Dr. Müller on the life of
      Solomides, a few hundred people try in vain to be heard by
      journalists of the Figaro, Ministry of Health, where a delegation
      is rebuked. [A 272]<br>
      <br>
      - On April 20, 1964, Solomides organized a press conference where
      many journalists listen to the testimonies of the sick and half a
      dozen doctors, Solomides asks. Very few publications follow, as
      editors do not want to take risks. The article of the editor of
      the Central Press Agency appears only in the review of Solomides.
      [A 268]<br>
      <br>
      - After the easy authorization to open Sceaux-Pharma in 1962, the
      renewal of the authorization scheduled for February 1964 did not
      arrive. After three years of numerous written and telephone
      requests, on July 7, 1967, the Ministry of Public Health justified
      a refusal to open an opening due to incomplete equipment and lack
      of capable personnel. The laboratory was therefore closed until 17
      March 1970, when the Ministry, recognizing its abuse of power,
      gave its authorization while the complaint brought by Solomides
      against the Ministry of Public Health was to be presented before
      the Paris Administrative Court [ : 212]. <br>
      <br>
      On 8 July 1970 the Administrative Court found that there were
      anomalies within the time-limit and that the contested decree was
      not legally justified because it was based on materially
      inaccurate facts. [A: 213] Although the State Is ordered to pay
      the costs, six years have been lost for applications for marketing
      authorizations [A: 214].<br>
      <br>
      - In 1965, the PS 88 is validated by the chemical and
      toxicological expertises. [A: 228] In 1970, Sceaux-Pharma reopened
      [A: 228] but did not produce anything, as it threatened closure if
      it produced drugs without a visa [A: 231]. Its leaders are seeking
      an expert for a clinical trial that would validate a visa. The
      first, who is slow to agree, refuses by saying that his hospital
      department does not have the favorable conditions for the
      experimentation to be valid. A second expert undertook
      satisfactory tests, acknowledged that he often achieved
      spectacular results, but refused to sign his expert report,
      because of the problems it might cause him with the Department of
      Public Health. In March 1972, a third expert, hospital chief in
      the north, was met by Solomides and Pierre Landrin. 25 out of 50
      patients should receive the drug, but it does not do the
      experiment [A: 230-231]. Since experimentation is mandatory on at
      least 100 patients, fewer hospital services can perform the tests;
      And the hospital chiefs are afraid of losing their renewable
      mandate every three years and displeasing the ministry [A: 231].<br>
      <br>
      - In June 1969, Irwin S. Morse, surgeon at South Miami Hospital,
      and Paul O. Nees of the Biological Section of the Wisconsin Alumni
      Research Foundation, published at the Sixth European Congress of
      the International College of Surgeons (FIC) By excision of the
      tumor after treatment and reduction to the physiatrons.
      Experimentation in necropsied rats afterwards revealed no
      significant toxicity. On spontaneous breast tumors of the dog,
      with four veterinarians: Drs Austin, Boyd, McMillan and Mueller,
      they observe reductions in tumor size. [A: 48-49]<br>
      <br>
      - In the 1970s, one month of Solomides treatment costs 70 to 200
      F, the most expensive being injected by intravenous injection,
      while one month of treatment with nine ampoules of Bleomycin costs
      1200 F; One month of Endoxan alone used costs 800 F, and half less
      associated with another; Triamcinolone (cortisone) costs 200 to
      600 F per month, and prednisone (cortancyl) about 80 F, but they
      are generally not used alone. Often avoiding hospitalization,
      Solomides treatment saves 75 to 750 francs per day of
      hospitalization. By avoiding operations, it saves the 800 F of an
      operation of a cancer of the uterus and the 2,000 F of a stomach
      cancer operation, besides the adjuvant drugs and the
      radiotherapies which can To reach 10,000 F. A dose of 60 mg radium
      for brachytherapy costs 7,200 F. And often these treatments are
      often used palliatively, with no hope of recovery. [A: 255-257]<br>
      <br>
      - In the weekly Paris-Match, Professor Oberling unveils a picture
      of his tools against cancer, among which is the Citral-Urethane,
      whose inventor is Solomides. [PS: 106] PS 120 C is a little toxic,

      She preferred to be prescribed by Dr. Jacques Nahon of synthetic

      18-year-old son Jean-Pierre was operated on 24 November 1970 at
      the Lariboisière hospital , To the brain for a right temporal
      cancerous tumor. The prognosis is "serious in the short term".
      Jean-Pierre undergoes two daily bites of cortisone. On 28 February
      1971 he entered a coma. On the 10th of March, Dr. T., consulted at
      Lariboisiere, said to his mother, "If there was anything, we would
      tell you. We warn you that there is nothing to be done." The next
      day, the mother went to see Dr. Solomides, whom an ambulance
      attendant had given him the address at the first transport of his
      son to Lariboisiere. It receives for two months ampoules of PS 300
      in injections. Jean-Pierre is recovering. The physician in charge
      of performing Lariboisière's treatment was not authorized by the
      Departmental Council of the Ordre des médecins to testify to the
      beneficial effect of synthetic physiatrists [A: 37-39].<br>

      from making such a declaration. Absent from Paris, he hardly gets
      a postponement until January 10, 1977, where he undergoes an

      judged on the law, not on the merits . Consequently, he did not
      call any patient or doctor as a witness, but Sauveur Calabria,
      president of the League for the priority application of Article 63
      of the Criminal Code for the Patient at Risk (LAPA 63). Prosecutor
      Lazari promises to review the law only several times, which he
      does not do [A: 296, 305-306]. Similarly, Jean Bernard severely
      criticizes the treatment of Solomides by asserting that they were
      not cancers, otherwise they would not have been cured [A: 298]. <br>

      Yet, in "Victories on Cancer" of October 1957, p. 8, describes the

      Dr V. prescribes peroxidases. The child heals and the parents will
      inform Professor JB who, to their amazement, says to know the
      treatment Solomides who would get 80% cure. [A: 297-298] In the
      courtroom, Professor Jean Bernard says that it is "to try all new
      therapeutics, whatever they may be, and if they are valid, their
      effectiveness is revealed before five or six years Mr. Solomides
      is not. " Yet, although he has been an influential member of the
      Academy of Medicine for many years, he has not asked for any
      experimentation [A: 302-303]. Professor Verhaegue admits that the
      Solomides treatment reduces the inflammation and the volume of the
      tumor, but regrets the silence of the patients aware of the
      threats. [A: 303-304]<br>
      <br>
      On 18 December 1978, Solomides was sentenced for the illegal
      practice of medicine and pharmacy, to the maximum of the fine, and
      especially to close his institute. While Jean Solomides appeals,
      some twenty patients march in the Palais de Justice, shouting

      experimentation of medicines developed by Jean Solomides": a full
      page of 350 signatures in The daily "Le Matin de Paris" including
      that of 170 doctors, about thirty elected officials, journalists,

      On April 27, 1979, an inquiry was made in Paris-Match No. 1561,

      who claims to have found a miracle cure for cancer in his back
      kitchen for thirty years? ", While he made his discovery at the
      Institut Pasteur. He said: "A few months ago, a couple of weeks
      before he went to trial, his son who works with him came to me and
      asked me to test the drug in the man. Judgment as if it were a
      possible thing, it takes twelve or eighteen months to get serious
      results. " The judgment, on December 18, 1978, preceded the visit

      In Le Monde on March 31, 1979, Dr. Charles Proux, who headed the
      radiotherapy unit at the Tenon Hospital, said that "the patients
      felt better, they regained some energy, but there was no cure and
      No direct effects on tumors. " But even an analgesic effect should
      have caused the greatest interest, since Professor Léon
      Schwarzenberg, at the Entretiens de Bichat 1979, advocated to
      reduce the suffering of terminal cancer patients by injecting a

      wondered what Beljanski thought of Solomides. At the CIRIS General
      Assembly in 2002 or 2003, a collaborator told me that Beljanski
      thought that Solomides was a charlatan. This was confirmed to me
      in 2009 by Dr. Jean Lacaze, who told me that he had received a

      The court of correctional of Marseilles has made its decision

      Five people, including two pharmacists and a doctor, and the

      cancer or multiple sclerosis.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Solomide products, synthetic physiatrists or peroxidases have been
      used for years against certain cancers, including cancers known to
      be serious and serious, such as cancers of the brain, lung,
      leukemias and others. In spite of this, the laboratory which has
      been officially manufacturing and selling Solomides products for
      many years in France has been "dismantled" by the Gendarmes of the
      Central Office for the Fight Against Environment and Public
      Health, thus depriving The sick of many interesting remedies.<br>
      <br>
      It should be remembered that Dr. Solomides, a graduate of science,
      a former researcher at the Pasteur Institute, invented synthetic
      physiatrists or peroxidases (PS) in the 1950s, with which he began
      by curing his father with a Cancer of the liver in terminal phase.
      The principle of these remedies is that distilled and solubilized
      oil of cod liver would bring oxygen to the cancer cell, which
      would seriously harm it, because it lives in anaerobic (in the
      absence of oxygen). The PS have demonstrated efficacy against
      certain severe cancers such as gliomas (brain tumors with very
      poor prognosis), bronchial cancers, certain inoperable
      meningiomas, leukemias including myeloma ... but also multiple
      sclerosis, viral hepatitis, ulcerative colitis Hemorrhagic, etc.
      These products did not present themselves as alternatives to
      conventional treatments, but as complements, thus giving hope
      where they were no longer available.<br>
      <br>
      However, as is often the case in natural medicine, studies on PS
      were rare and limited in number of cases due to a lack of
      financial resources. However, numerous testimonies attest to the
      soundness of the method. So, instead of banning and seizing these
      remedies sold for more than 50 years, perhaps it would have been
      more judicious for the sick, to seriously study their therapeutic
      effects? Because modern medicine is only of very limited efficacy
      against gliomas, lung cancer, multiple sclerosis, viral hepatitis
      ... So the "discovery" of a complementary treatment would not have
      been superfluous ...<br>

      is prepared by reacting an alkali or alkaline earth metal

      tris(polyoxyethylene ether) of castor oil with an alkali or

      comprise an iodohydrin of a water-soluble tris(polyoxyethylene
      ether) of castor oil complexed with an alkali metal or alkaline
      earth metal iodide and iodate together with a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier and/or diluent. The preparations are
      anti-carcinogenic.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to organic iodine compounds with
      therapeutic properties.<br>
      <br>
      According to this invention we provide a process for the
      preparation of an organic iodine compound with therapeutic
      properties in which process an alkali metal or an alkaline earth
      metal hypoiodite is reacted with a water-soluble tris
      (polyoxyethylene ether) of castor oil (ERP), to form an iodohydrin
      of ERP complexed with an iodide and an iodate of an alkali metal
      or an alkaline earth metal.<br>
      <br>
      According to a feature of the present invention potassium
      hypoiodite is used as the mineral hypoiodite.<br>
      <br>
      According to another feature of the invention, the reaction is
      carried out with agitation.<br>
      <br>
      As a new medicine, particularly for use in the treatment of
      tumours of cancerous origin, the invention covers an iodohydrin of
      ERP complexed with an iodide and an iodate of an alkali metal or
      an alkaline earth metal.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that the reaction between the hypoiodite and ERP
      involves a peroxide effect with an acid reaction which neutralises
      the strong alkalinity of the mineral hypoiodite by liberating
      hypoiodous acid (I011) whidh fixes on the double bond of the
      treated organic compound. Iodine derivatives and iodohydrins are
      then formed.<br>
      <br>
      It is not possible to prove the presence of [Price 4s. 6d.]
      peroxide either before or after hypoiodation and it is not yet
      known by what mechanism the p11 of the hypoiodite falls to values
      in the region of neutrality.<br>
      <br>
      The process for the preparation of the new iodine derivatives in
      accordance with the invention comprises two phases:<br>
      <br>
      (a) Prepamition of tho potdirsium, hypiodite grs of potash tablets
      and 50 grs of iodine sublimate are brought into contact in a
      crystalliser or a litre flask (balloon type); a litre of distilled
      water is then added in small quantities with constant agitation. A
      yellowish liquid having a very strong iodoform odour and a very
      alkaline pH is rapidly obtained, in one or two minutes. No
      precipitate remains and there is no trace of undissolved iodine.<br>
      <br>
      (b) Hypodisation of ERP The litre of potassium hypoiodite
      solution, prepared as stated above, is immediately mixed by
      stirring with two litres of ERP. A small amount of heat is given
      off and this raises the temperature of the mixture to
      approximately 350C to 400C; it is followed by a progressive
      reduction of the pH which passes from 12 to 13 to approximately
      7.5 by a mechanism which still remains obscure, since the ERP is
      not an acid substance (pH 6.5-6.8 in a 10% solution in distilled
      water).<br>
      <br>
      The resulting product is soluble in water, and is very soluble in
      urethan water. By simple acidification it liberates Wodine, it
      also liberates iodine in potassium iodide solutions, acidified by
      acetic acid, but does not discolour indigo blue as does the
      mineral hypoiodite for its pH is neutral.<br>
      <br>
      Physico-chemicad chkracteristics Non-ionic surface active agents,
      of which ERP forms part, have the basic property of separating 2
      1,077,6S3 in aqueous solution and at temperatures above 40'C into
      two layers: a lower layer formed of the non-ionic detergent and an
      upper layer formed of the solvent which in this case is water.
      However, it has been discovered that the product of the
      hypoiodisation of ERP in solution in 15 to 20%' of water, does not
      become cloudy and no longer separates into two layers whatever the
      temperature to which it is raised (even 1O00GC. All the test
      solutions of ERP alone, or associated with potassium iodide,
      potassium iodate or both together, become cloudy and separate into
      two layers at approximately 60 whatever their pH (neutral, acid or
      alkaline). One concludes that the potassium iodide and the
      potassium iodate formed by dissociation from the hypoiodite
      according to the reaction: 3KIO= KI03 +2 KI, are not sufficient to
      confer upon ERP such remarkable stability to heat. The
      simultaneous presence of KIO therefore seems necessary.<br>
      <br>
      Ciernecat chliwacterIstics In our work in respect of the present
      invention we applied ourselves particularly to proving the
      possible existence of the organic hypoiodite I0-R function where R
      is the residue of the hypoiodised ERP, but without any success.<br>
      <br>
      The classical reactions considered as specific for the presence of
      hypoiodite: reaction of hyposulphite which is transformed into
      sulphate, of arsenite (which is transformed into arsenate) of urea
      into nitrogen and of oxygenated water into oxygen proved to be
      negative. Likewise, indigo blue was not bleached by the product of
      the invention. It appears therefore that the hypoiodite fixes on
      the double link to form an iodohydrin according to the reaction:<br>
      <br>
      I-OH±CH=ICH-&gt;-CHI-CHOH.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of potassium iodide and potassium iodate has been
      proved by simple acidification with acetic acid. A bright red
      coloration of the solution by liberation of iodine is then
      discovered. However, it is necessary to acidify with acetic acid
      to obtain with silver nitrate a yellowish and very abundant
      precipitate of silver iodide; with lead acetate no precipitate is
      obtained and acidification leads only to liberation of iodine.<br>
      <br>
      Test solutions of XII and of potassium iodate alone or associated
      with ERP have given abundant precipitates.<br>
      <br>
      However, although with silver nitrate, in an acid medium at least,
      the hypoiodised ERP can be demineralised under the conditions we
      have indicated, this does not happen with lead acetate, the
      negative reactions of which suggest that KI and KIOR are very
      strongly bound or complexed with fthe ERP molecule.<br>
      <br>
      The organic iodine derivatives according to the invention have
      numerous advantages, in particular (a) a pH in the region of
      neutrality and (b) very good stability.<br>
      <br>
      The new iodine derivatives have anti-carcinogenic properties.<br>
      <br>
      The most common mineral hypoiodite is potassium hypoiodite.<br>
      <br>
      The new iodine derivatives may be introduced into the organism
      particularly intravenously, orally or per rectum for several
      months without any disturbance of the blood count and the
      leutocytic formula carried out in the course of treatment and
      without causing sclerosis or any incident.<br>
      <br>
      The new iodine derivatives therefore are not toxic in therapeutic
      doses and do not produce any sensitisation. Nevertheless, the
      administration of hypoiodised ERP should, 80 as a precaution, be
      effected gradually under strict supervision.<br>
      <br>
      Polarographic Characteristics of the ERP-Hypoiodite Product The
      polarograph has confirmed the existence of two half-wave
      potentials corresponding exactly to those of potassium iodide and
      potassium iodate such as are found with test solutions in an
      indifferent electrolyte (lithium chloride, and in equivalent
      quantities.<br>
      <br>
      Toxicological tests It has not yet been possible to find the
      lethal dose for 50%,/ of animals treated (DL 50); several rats
      received 5 cm' of 10%o 95 aqueous solutions of hypoiodised ERP
      three times a week for four weeks. None of the animals of the 6
      treated died or showed the least sign of poisoning. In a healthy
      person or one affected by cancerous tumors, 100 no toxicity is
      observed, the blood formula remains good as also the level of urea
      in the blood. On the other hand, in certain cases of voluminous
      tumors of patients, who are already very tired, a considerable
      decrease in the red corpuscles is sometimes observed at the same
      time as fast melting away of the tumors, with or without an
      increase in the level of urea in the blood. This is indirect
      intoxication from rapid cell destruction (lysis) of tumors of
      people who are already debilitated and undermined by illness. The
      administration of hypoiodised ERP to these patients must be given
      progressively and under strict supervision. 115 Therapeutic tests
      In the case of a rat grafted with the tumor T8 of Guerin, a clear
      stoppage of the growth of the tumor is observed. At the moment it
      is a matter of simple inhibition of 120 the evolution of the tumor
      of the treated rats compared with that of untreated controls.<br>
      <br>
      Tests are repeated with higher concentrations of hypoiodised ERP.<br>
      <br>
      With man, using the existing hypoiodised 125 ERP prepared
      according to the instructions -1,077,683 1,077,683 indicated, and
      according to an example of non-restrictive formula, Hypoiodised
      ERP 15 cm' (10% aqueous solution) Nipagine 1/10 000 Ethylene
      glycol 1 cm' Urethane 3 g Distilled water to 100 cm3 there is
      obtained considerable cell destruction of tumors with a cure which
      it is hoped is complete. The following notes constitute an
      example:<br>
      <br>
      Mmme C... of Paut. Ample removal with auxiliary cleansing of the
      left breast. Radiotherapy, then shortly after, right pulmonary
      metastasis treated by Endoxan. Before the end of this treatment,
      left sub-clavicular metastasis. Treatment by hypoiodised ERP, cc
      daily intravenously at first, then per rectum, progressive
      resorption in approximately 3 months of the pulmonary and
      subclavicular metastasis. General condition excellent. Apparent
      cure, but the treatment still continuing on a smaller scale.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the present invention is not limited
      to the above described examples, as other detailed methods and
      other detailed forms may be adopted without departing from the
      scope of the invention as defined by the claims.<br>
