        <b>Field of the Invention </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        The invention relates to method of enhancing fuel efficiency in
        an internal combustion engine using a water electrolysis system.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Background of the Invention </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        An electrolysis chamber for generation of oxygen and hydrogen
        gas for supply to the cylinder of an internal combustion engine
        is taught in U.S. Patent 5,231,954 to Stowe. The chamber
        includes a housing having a pair of electrodes therein at least
        partially submerged in an electrolyte solution. The electrodes
        are connected to a source of electrical potential to generate
        oxygen and hydrogen from the electrolyte solution in the
        chamber. The chamber is mounted in association with an engine
        and oxygen and hydrogen generated are fed to the engine via a
        line connected to the air intake manifold. In order to reduce
        the risk of explosion, the chamber has a friction fitted top cap
        which provides for pressure release under conditions where
        oxygen and hydrogen gas builds up within the chamber. The top
        cap has an end wall and a cylindrical side wall extending
        therefrom. The side wall fits over and extends down the sides of
        the chamber. To be removed, this top cap requires substantial
        clearance above the chamber. Such clearance is often unavailable
        in the engine area of most vehicles. In addition, should the top
        cap described in the patent be released it is generally
        incapable of reseating itself to seal the chamber. If the top
        cap blows off, the vehicle operator can continue to operate the
        vehicle for a period of time without noticing that the chamber
        is open. This results in the potential for spillage of the
        electrolyte solution and, most importantly, in the operation of
        the vehicle without the benefits of the oxygen and hydrogen
        supplementation of the fuel. Summary of the Invention It is one
        object of the present invention to provide an improved method

        <b>Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Referring to Figures 1 and 2, an electrolytic chamber 2 is
        shown. When in use) the chamber generates oxygen and hydrogen
        gases together with steam or water vapour and structured water.
        The various features of the invention for release of internal
        pressure, for avoiding spillage and leakage of electrolytic
        solution and for enhancing operation of the chamber, as will be
        described, need not all be present in the same chamber or
        electrolysis system, as the presence of one or more of the
        features may not be required for the application to which the
        chamber is to be put.<br>
        <br>
        Alternately, the various aspects can all be present in the
        chamber or the system at all times, but be only used as needed.
        Chamber 2 includes a housing 4 formed to contain an electrolyte
        solution 6, The chamber can be cylindrical as shown or any other
        shape suitable for its intended use. To facilitate construction,
        housing 4 preferably has a top 4a and a bottom 4b sealably
        secured as by suitable adhesives to a cylindrical side wall 4c.
        Housing 4 is formed from any chemically and electrically inert
        material. Preferably, housing 4 is formed from the material
        known as' acrylonitrile butadiene styrene resin (ABS) because of
        its resistance to chemicals such as the electrolyte solution and
        its ability to withstand large temperature fluctuations without
        degradation. In addition, ABS plastic is not brittle and during
        a chamber failure wherein there is a build up of internal
        pressure, the chamber formed using ABS will tend to crack rather
        than shatter. Housing 4 has a pressure release section 8 which
        is burstable upon application of pressure, such as internal
        pressure) thereon. Section 8 of the housing has a reduced
        thickness T relative to the thickness of the balance of the
        housing. This section can be formed during the molding or
        extrusion process or can be milled out after formation of the
        housing. Section 8 can be integral with the housing or,
        alternately) be an inset piece of material, such as is shown by
        way of example in Figure 2a. In the alternative configuration of
        Figure 2A, a vent port 8a is covered by a displaceable cover 8b
        which is urged into sealing contact with the top 4a by means of
        a biasing element 8c such as a spring. In the preferred
        embodiment of Figure 2, pressure release section 8 has a lower
        strength than the material used in the formation of the
        remainder of the housing. Section 8 is selected to burst when a
        selected amount of pressure, such as caused by an explosion of
        the combustible mixed materials within the chamber, is applied
        thereto. To burst section 8, the amount of pressure is selected
        to be greater than that pressure which is exerted toward the
        inside of the chamber when the chamber is under vacuum during
        use. Port 10 is formed through the housing at an upper portion
        thereof for introduction of water, electrolytes and/or
        electrolytic solution. Port 10 has removably inserted therein a
        plug 12 for sealing the port. Preferably, plug 12 is only
        fractionally engaged in the port and can be removed by
        application of a force to pull or push the plug out of the port.
        Preferably, plug 12 has side walls 12a which converge toward the
        bottom 12b of the plug (i.e. the end which is inserted into the
        port) and the port is preferably positioned on the top of the
        housing, as determined by the intended mounting position of the
        chamber. Such a plug and port arrangement facilitates the
        release of internal pressure and greatly reduces the risk of
        explosion which was encountered in previous systems since) it
        will be appreciated, that due to the converging side walls any
        movement of the plug out of the port will immediately break the
        seal between the plug and the housing. In addition, the shape of
        the plug permits it to easily resent itself should it be pushed
        out of sealing position, but remain loosely, in the port. To
        further facilitate resenting, the plug is preferably formed to
        be generally conical in shape.<br>
        <br>
        Preferably, side walls 12a of plug 12 are coated with a
        resilient material, such as rubber, to facilitate sealing
        against the edges of port 10. Alternately. plug 12 can be formed
        at least in part of a resilient material. In a preferred
        embodiment, plug 12 is formed from a rubber stopper. An opening
        for passage of electrolysis mixed materials is provided by means
        of delivery port 14 found at the upper portion of the chamber
        and is present to provide an exit for the mixed materials
        produced during the electrolysis process. In a preferred
        embodiment, port 14 is formed through plug 12. As may be
        understood, the port 14 can alternately be formed through any
        suitable opening provided in housing 4. A connector 16 is
        provided at port 14 for connection to a delivery line 18 at the
        time of installation for use. Preferably, as shown, connector 16
        is removable from the port for replacement or repair. Referring
        also to Figure 3, electrodes 22, 23 and 28 are provided within
        chamber 2. The electrode material is selected from any suitable
        electric conductor which will not chemically react with the
        electrolytic solution either when electrically energized or not.
        A suitable material for construction of electrodes 22, 23) and
        28 is stainless steel. While it will be understood that
        electrode 28 may be configured as a cathode and electrode 22 as
        an anode, or polarity of each may be reversed without changing
        the principles of operation, for the purpose of illustration.
        the central electrode 28 has been configured as an anode while
        outer electrode 22 is configured as a cathode. Preferably
        electrode 22 is positioned to rest against the interior surface
        of housing 4 consequently making it cylindrical in shape to
        correspond with the cross- sectional dimension of the chamber.
        An extension 22a of the cathode extends up the inside of the
        housing 4 for electrical connection to a power supply terminal
        24, which is conveniently provided by a bolt. Bolt 24 passes
        through an aperture in the housing and is electrically connected
        to a wire 26 when installed for use. Wire 26 extends to a
        negative ground pole of a battery or a ground) as will be
        described in more detail with reference to Figure 4. Centrally
        located in the electrolyte solution 6 is anode 28. Anode 28 may
        be constructed from any suitable electrical conductor which does
        not react with the electrolyte solution and is preferably a
        cylinder and may conveniently be a rod formed of stainless steel
        in common with cathode 22 and intermediate electrodes 23. Anode
        28 is connected by a conductor bracket 30 to a power supply
        terminal 32 which is a bolt extending through an aperture in the
        housing. Bolt 32 is electrically connected at one end to bracket
        30 and, when installed, to wire 34 at its opposite end when
        installed for use. Wire 34 is ultimately in electrical contact
        with the positive pole of a battery, as will be described in
        more detail with reference to Figures 4 and 5. Anode 28 is
        further maintained in position concentrically within cathode 22
        by plates 36, 37. Plates 36) 37 are formed of a non-conductive
        material such as, for example, an ultra high molecular weight
        polyethylene (UHMW polymeric resin). Anode 28 is positioned in
        centrally located apertures in the plates. A plurality of
        apertures 41 are formed in plate 36 for passage of the
        electrolysis generated mixed materials from area 40 to area 42
        where the mixed materials will bubble up and flow toward
        delivery port 14.<br>
        <br>
        A plurality of intermediate electrodes 23 are disposed between
        the powered cathode 22 and anode 28. The shape of these
        electrodes conforms to the equipotential lines of the electric
        field induced in electrolyte solution 6 when power is applied to
        the cathode 22 and anode 28. As most clearly seen in Figure 3,
        the intermediate electrodes 23 are formed into cylinders to
        conform with the circular cross-sectional shape of the
        electrolysis chamber 4 and are positioned between anode 28 and
        cathode 22. Each electrode is constructed from suitable
        chemically inert electrically conductive material, such as
        stainless steel, which has been rolled and either welded along a
        seam (not shown) or the edges left open. The number of
        intermediate electrodes 23 is selected to provide approximately
        2 volts across each cell formed by the gap in spacing between
        each electrode. A 2 volt difference is preferable to reduce the
        ohmic heating of the electrolyte solution bounded by adjacent
        electrode by the current passing therethrough as the
        electromotive force or voltage required for electrolysis of
        water is approximately 1.5 volts. Thus for a 12 volt system, a
        group of intermediate electrodes 23 may be provided. For other
        operating voltages, a differing number of electrodes are
        provided to achieve like effect. While the electrodes are
        depicted in Figures 2 and 3 as being equidistantly spaced, it
        will be understood that the actual physical placement or spacing
        of the intermediate electrodes 23 will be such as to create
        approximately a 2 volt differential between adjacent electrodes.
        With concentric cylindrical electrodes, varying physical
        spacings are required to maintain a uniform electromotive force
        differential between adjacent electrodes increasing the
        complexity of the electrolyte chamber in both construction and
        operation. For cylindrical electrolysis chambers, each cell,
        being the electrolyte solution and surrounding operative
        electrode pair, has a unique electrolyte solution volume and
        electrode surface area resulting in variations in production.
        efficiencies and operating parameters. A uniform result for each
        cell in the electrolysis chamber apparatus may be obtained by
        employing a chamber in the shape of a box having a rectangular
        cross-section as shown in Figure 3a. With such a chamber shape,
        the equipotential surfaces induced in the electrolyte solution
        when electrical potential is applied to the cathode 22 and anode
        28 are flat surfaces enabling the intermediate electrodes 23 to
        be flat and equidistantly spaced from one another resulting in
        substantially uniform construction and operating parameters for
        the electrolysis chamber 4. The spacing of the intermediate
        electrodes 23 can be achieved in any suitable way, for example,
        by plates 36, 37 which have formed therein a plurality of
        grooves into which intermediate electrodes 23 are fitted as
        shown most clearly in cross section in Figure 2. The grooves
        maintain the positioning of the electrodes relative to each
        other and to the anode and cathode. The intermediate electrodes
        23 serve a number of useful purposes. First, the electrodes act
        as baffles to substantially damp any wave action in the liquid
        within the chamber. This reduces the likelihood that the
        electrolyte solution 6 will splash around in the chamber. Where
        the chamber is cylindrical in shape the damping action will be
        effective regardless of the direction in which the chamber is
        moved. Additionally, the intermediate electrodes increase the
        electrode surface area for the generation of electrolysis mixed
        materials, as well as reduce the electromotive force being
        applied to the cell to a value most efficacious for water
        electrolysis. This provides a more efficient chamber with higher
        generation capabilities and lower operating temperatures than a
        chamber of similar size having therein only the cathode and the
        anode electrodes. Also each pair of plates creates its own
        electrolytic cell. It will be noted that the terminals 24 and 32
        are mounted in the wall of the chamber above the top plate 36.
        This is arranged at a position which is above the intended
        height of the electrolyte solution in its upper most filled
        position. Thus in the wall just below the level of the
        connectors is provided a high level indicator contact 90 which
        is provided to contact the electrolyte solution in the highest
        intended position to indicate through the light, as described in
        more detail hereinafter that the container is filled. <br>
        <br>
        A low level indicator 91 positioned on the waH of the chamber at
        a height below the upper level indicator and at a position just
        below the top plate 36. The central electrode 28 in the form of
        the rod includes a washer 92 positioned directly above the plate
        36 and locating the plate relative to the central rod. The plate
        36 is thus clamped between the washer 92 which prevents the
        plate from moving upwardly and the upper edges of the
        cylindrical intermediate electrodes. The central rod is fastened
        to the base plate 37. Above the top plate 36 is provided a
        splash plate 93 supported on the central rod 28 by two spaced
        washers 94 and 95. The splash plate 93 is a solid plate formed
        of UHMW polyethylene extending outwardly to a position adjacent
        but spaced inwardly from the inside surface of the cylindrical
        container leaving an annular space for the passage of mixed
        materials but preventing or reducing the possibility of
        spattering of the electrolyte solution from its position
        underneath the splash plate to the discharge outlet 14. Thus the
        top plate, the splash plate and the cylindrical electrodes
        cooperate in reducing movement of the electrolyte solution
        during normal operation of the engine. Turning now to Figures 5
        and 6 there is shown schematically the upper portion of the
        electrolysis chamber and particularly the top cap. An additional
        opening 96 is provided with a plug 97 similar to the plug 12.
        The plug 97 receives a filler duct 98 connected with a supply
        container 99 containing the electrolyte solution including
        distilled water and a makeup quantity of KOH. A solenoid valve
        100 is located in the duct 98 for controlling flow of liquid
        through the duct. The solenoid valve is actuated by output 4 of
        a micro-controller 101. The high level indicator 90 is connected
        to input 2 of the micro- controller. Similarly the low level
        contact 91 provides an input to terminal 3 of the
        micro-controller when the electrolyte solution drops below the
        contact 91 and therefore is no longer electrical communication
        with that contact. An input terminal 1 of the micro-controller
        receives an input from the contact 24 so that it is responsive
        to operation of the electrolysis chamber. Thus when the chamber
        is in operation and therefore vacuum is applied through the duct
        to the opening 14, in the event that the level of electrolyte
        solution falls below the level of the low contact 91, the
        micro-controller 101 actuates the solenoid switch 100 to allow
        liquid to be drawn from the container 99 into the chamber to
        replenish the electrolyte solution. The automatic control system
        of Figure 5 also has two further functions. Firstly the
        measurement of the current through the electrolysis unit which
        is provided to input 1 is used to determine when the strength of
        the electrolyte in the solution falls below a predetermined
        required level. This will occur when the current falls below a
        predetermined minimum. In this situation the control unit is
        arranged to illuminate light 90A to show to the operator that
        additional electrolyte is required. Electrolyte is then added
        through the top plug manually from a concentrated solution.
        Secondly the input 3 of the controller detects the presence of
        current in a situation where the ignition is turned off and
        therefore the engine is not operating. In the presence of such
        current, the controller is arranged to actuate light 91 A so
        that the operator is apprised of a situation where current is
        flowing when no current should be flowing thus indicating a
        fault. In Figure 6 is shown a similar manual arrangement in
        which a light 91 B at the dashboard of the vehicle, or at any
        other suitable location where it can be viewed by the operator,
        is illuminated when the electrolyte solution level falls to a
        low position. The operator can therefore actuate a press button
        switch 103 when the operator has noted that the electrolyte
        solution level is too low and that the engine is applying vacuum
        to the duct 18. The press button switch operates the valve 100
        and this is maintained actuated until the electrolyte solution
        level reaches the upper contact 90 and illuminates the visible
        light 90B. Referring to Figure 4, electrolysis chamber 2
        generates hydrogen and oxygen gases together with the steam and
        structured water to supplement the fuel supply of a combustion
        engine, such as a hydrocarbon fueled internal combustion engine
        employed to supply motive power to an automobile. It will
        however be appreciated that the present invention can be used
        with other machines using an engine.. Common gasoline or diesel
        engines have an air intake system supplying a mixture of fuel
        and air to be combusted within the engine. The air intake system
        is maintained under vacuum during operation of the engine. A
        battery 60 has a positive pole 60a and a negative ground pole
        60b. In accordance with the invention, a chamber 2 is mounted in
        a suitable location at the engine when possible. Power supply
        wire 26 from cathode 22 is grounded) for example by contact with
        the frame. Power supply wire 34 runs from contact with anode 28
        to a control power relay switch .62. From relay switch 62, power
        wire 34 runs through an over-current protection device 66, such
        as a circuit breaker, fusible link or fuse to positive pole 60a
        of battery 60. Relay switch 62 controls the supply of electrical
        energy to the electrolysis chamber 2. Over-current protector 66
        prevents over-current damage to the components caused by a
        malfunction, such as a short circuit. To control and prevent
        unwanted generation of the mixed materials, the control relay
        switch 62 is configured in such a manner as to ensure that no
        electrical power will be supplied to electrolysis chamber 2
        unless the engine is both switched on and running. This is
        controlled in the following manner. Power relay control wire 68
        controls the activation of power relay 62 depending on control
        signaling received via vacuum switch 70. Vacuum switch 70 is a
        normally open switch which is Gosed, making electrical contact
        with ignition line 72, when vacuum is supplied to tubing 71.
        Ignition line 72 is powered from the ignition key system 81,
        becoming powered when the ignition switch is turned ON. A fuse
        75 is provided for safety. The vacuum to operate the vacuum
        switch 70 is obtained from the air intake system of the engine
        communicated by intake supply line 73 to which tubing 71 is
        connected via T-connector 80. As will be readily understood, the
        engine will only generate a vacuum when it is running and the
        presence of vacuum switch 70 ensures that production of the
        mixed materials will only occur when the engine is running. Thus
        when the engine has stalled or the ignition switch is, for any
        reason) on but the engine is not running, no electrolysis will
        occur. While it will be understood that tubing 71 can be
        directly connected to the engine manifold to obtain a vacuum
        supply directly from the engine, the preferred construction is
        to employ a T-connector 80 which bridges engine intake supply
        line 73 and the supply line 75. This provides added safety by
        preventing the undesirable escape of the combustible mixed
        materials into the engine compartment thereby avoiding potential
        explosion risks. When the rate of production of electrolysis
        mixed materials delivered by supply line 75 exceeds the rate of
        consumption of those mixed materials through the engine vacuum
        present in the engine intake supply line 73, the excess
        production mixed materials will "flood" into the vacuum tubing
        71 thereby causing vacuum switch 70 to open, thereby,
        interrupting the power 75 supplied to the electrolysis chamber 2
        halting further production. The electrolyte solution can be any
        suitable solution of water and electrolytic agent permitting
        current to move through the solution between the electrodes 22
        and 28. An efficacious electrolytic agent will not react during
        or be affected by the water electrolysis process to thereby
        become expended, decomposed or depleted during the water
        electrolysis process. The electrolytic agent must not be so
        volatile as to be removed from solution along with the emitted
        mixed materials; and, because hydrogen-ion concentrations are
        being rapidly perturbed at the electrodes during the water
        electrolysis process, the electrolytic agent should have a
        strong resistance to pH changes. In one embodiment, the
        electrolyte solution is made of distilled water and the
        electrolytic agent is effective quantities of potassium
        hydroxide (KOH), generally about 10 g KOH per 1.2L of water.
        During operation, electrolytic agent concentrations in the water
        will vary. The electrolyte solution is added through port 10 to
        the chamber. Once it is added, it is only necessary to add
        distilled make-up water on an occasional basis to maintain the
        unit in operation. Adding make-up water may be accomplished by
        removing plug 12 and pouring in the make-up water and thereafter
        replacing plug 12. Make-up water should be distilled water to
        avoid contamination of the electrolytic solution with the
        dissolved salts and other minerals and. contaminants present in
        water that is not distilled. Electrical current to the system is
        actuated by turning the ignition switch key to start the engine.
        The current flowing from anode 28 to cathode 22 causes the
        electrolysis of the water in the electrolyte solution. The
        operation of the engine causes a vacuum to be set up in the air
        intake system of the engine. This vacuum draws the plug 12 down
        into port 10 to seal the port. Any generated mixed materials
        from the chamber are drawn through supply line 18, to air intake
        manifold 113 wherein they are mixed with the air and burned with
        the fuel.<br>
        <br>
        Electrolysis occurs as long as the engine is running and vacuum
        is applied to vacuum switch 70. When either the ignition key 81
        is turned to the off position, or the supply of vacuum to vacuum
        switch 70 falls below a preselected threshold amount (because
        either the engine stalls or stops) or production of the mixed
        materials delivered over line 75 exceeds engine vacuum) power to
        the electrolysis chamber is cut off by power relay 62 in
        response to interruption of the control signal provided to the
        relay by wire 68 resulting in cessation of generation of mixed
        materials. Electrolysis mixed materials produced within chamber
        2 are carried along supply line 18 to flow control valve 78
        which is a directional valve connecting supply line 18 to supply
        line 75 when control wire 68 is energized (the ignition 81 is on
        and vacuum switch 70 is receiving vacuum) allowing produced
        mixed materials to be directed to engine supply line 73. Any
        mixed materials which, through a system failure, are generated
        while the engine is turned off or remain in electrolysis chamber
        2 following engine shut off causes control line 68 to lose power
        thereby causing solenoid valve 78 to couple supply line 18 to
        the vent line 82 to expel the excess/surplus mixed materials
        harmlessly into the ambient atmosphere. in the unlikely event
        that solenoid valve 78 falls or ignition of the mixed materials
        occurs within electrolysis chamber 2) any accumulated mixed
        materials or excessive pressures will be released by pushing out
        plug 12 or bursting area 8. The arrangement as previously
        described herein of the electrolysis chamber, its arrangement of
        the electrodes and the selection of the electrolyte using KOH
        provides an arrangement in which the electrolytic action
        generates not only oxygen and hydrogen but also steam and
        structured water. The potassium in the KOH is particularly
        important in this regard. All these elements are then
        communicated from the chamber through the duct to the combustion
        chamber 110. Thus the duct 73 is connected to the air intake 111
        of the combustion chamber at a position downstream of the air
        filter 112. A manifold 113 receives fuel through a pump 114 from
        a fuel supply 115 from an injector 116. The manifold 113
        supplies the fuel, air and the mixed materials from the
        electrolysis chamber into the combustion chamber 110. The above
        components from the electrolysis chamber cooperate with the
        combustion of the hydro carbon fuels from the supply 115 so as
        to effect cracking of the unspent fuel in the presence of oxygen
        and hydrogen. The oxygen and hydrogen can increase the
        temperature of the combustion and the presence of the steam and
        structured water operates as an effective cracking agent.<br>
        <br>
        The above components therefore in the combustion chamber crack
        the normally unspent long chain and aromatic hydrocarbons
        causing the production of shorter chain hydrocarbons which are
        readily combustible thereby dramatically reducing emissions. The
        long chain and aromatic hydrocarbons can make up 30 to 50% of
        the total fuel so that it will be appreciated that a significant
        increase in efficiency is obtained by cracking these
        hydrocarbons and making them readily combustible. Yet further,
        the addition of the above components from the chamber results in
        a combustion in the combustion chamber which is sufficient to
        effect combustion of the pollutants normally produced in
        combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. It has been found, therefore,
        that such pollutants in the air drawn into the air intake can be
        burnt in the combustion chamber. In this way the pollutants
        released from the combustion through the exhaust system can be
        significantly reduced relative to the amount of pollutants drawn
        in through the air intake. In this way instead of the combustion
        chamber acting to generate additional pollutants which are
        emitted into the atmosphere, the combustion chamber and its
        combustion using the components set forth above can obtain a
        situation where it acts to reduce the amount of pollutants in
        the air surrounding the combustion chamber by drawing those
        pollutants into the combustion chamber from the air intake. It
        will be appreciated that this effect of cracking of the
        hydrocarbons and of providing an increased combustion effect
        thus burning the pollutants does not simply arise from the
        submission of oxygen and hydrogen into the combustion system.
        The amount of hydrogen generated in the electrolysis chamber is
        relatively small and is certainly insufficient to generate the
        improvements in energy from the hydrocarbon fuel which are
        obtained using this arrangement. In practice it has been found
        that increase in energy of 30 to 50% can be obtained utilizing
        amounts of the mixed materials which cannot possibly themselves
        provide this additional energy. It will be apparent that many
        changes may be made to the illustrative embodiments, while
        failing within the scope of the invention and it is intended
        that all such changes be covered by the claims appended hereto.<br>

        An electrolyzer cell (10) for the electrolysis of water
        comprises a cathode (12) of generally tubular configuration
        within which is disposed an anode (1 6) separated from the
        cathode (12) by a separation membrane (14) of generally tubular
        configuration which divides the electrolyte chamber (15) into an
        ano de sub-chamber (15a) and a cathode sub-chamber (15b). An
        electrolyzer apparatus (36) includes an array (38) of individual
        cells (10) across each of which an electric potential is imposed
        by a DC generator (40) via electrical leads (42a, 42b). Hydrogen
        gas generated within cells (10) from electrolyte (18) i s
        removed via hydrogen gas take-off lines (20) and hydrogen
        manifold line (21) . By-product oxygen is removed from cells
        (10) by oxygen gas take-off lines (2 2) and oxygen manifold line
        (23). The electrolyzer apparatus (36) may be configured to
        operate either batchwise or in a continuous electrolyterecycle
        operation to produce high purity hydrogen at high pressure,
        e.g., up to abou t 10,000 psig, without need for gas compressors
        to compress product hydrogen.<br>
        <br>
        The present invention concerns an electrolyzes apparatus and
        method to produce high- pressure hydrogen at pressures up to
        10,000 psig or higher, by means of electrolysis of water and
        without necessity of separate compression equipment. Direct
        electrolytic generation of such high-pressure hydrogen (and
        by-product oxygen) is attainable by the practices of the present
        invention. [0002] Electrolytic production of hydrogen is, of
        course, well known, as illustrated by U.S. Patents 5,665,211 for
        "Electrolysis Apparatus for Producing Hydrogen"; 6,033,549 for
        "Method of Electrolysis"; 6,071,386 for "Electrolysis Apparatus;
        and 6,153,083 for "Electrolyzes Isolated by Encapsulation with
        Respect to Pressurized Water". [0003] Known electrolytic
        equipment, sometimes herein referred to as "electrolyzers",
        using liquid electrolyte to generate hydrogen, operates in the
        following way. Two electrodes are placed in a bath of liquid
        electrolyte, such as an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide
        (KOH). A broad range of potassium hydroxide concentration may be
        used, but optimally, a concentration of about 25 to 28% by
        weight KOH solution is used. The electrodes are separated from
        each other by a separation membrane that selectively allows
        passage of liquid but not gas through it. When a voltage is
        impressed across the electrodes (about 2 volts), current flows
        through the electrolyte between the electrodes. Hydrogen gas is
        produced at the cathode and oxygen gas is produced at the anode.
        The separation membrane keeps the hydrogen and oxygen gases
        separated as the generated gas bubbles rise through the liquid
        electrolyte. There is a disengagement space above the liquid
        electrolyte comprised of two separate chambers or two sections
        isolated from each other by being separated by a gas-tight
        barner into two separate sections, one chamber or section to
        receive the hydxogen gas and the other to receive the oxygen
        gas. The two gases are separately removed from the respective
        sections of the disengagement space for storage or venting.<br>

        <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Generally, in accordance with the present invention, there is
        provided an electrolytic apparatus and a method of generating
        pressurized hydrogen and by-product oxygen directly from the
        apparatus, without necessity of a separate pressurization step.
        The electrolytic apparatus, usually referred to as an
        "electrolyzer", has a tubular cathode within which a rod-lilce
        anode is disposed to define between the anode and cathode an
        electrolyte chamber. A tubular separation membrane is disposed
        between the anode and the cathode to divide the electrolyte
        chamber into an anode sub-chamber and an electrolyte
        sub-chamber. In a specific embodiment, the anode, separation
        membrane and cathode have a coaxial configuration, so that the
        anode sub-chamber and the cathode sub-chamber are of concentric,
        annular configuration. The two electrolyte sub-chambers are
        respectively connected in gas-flow communication to respective
        gas/liquid separators to provide segregated hydrogen and oxygen
        sections from which the two generated gases are separately
        withdrawn. [0005] Specifically, in accordance with the present
        invention there is provided an electrolyzer cell for the
        electrolysis of water having first and second opposite ends and
        comprising the following components. A cathode of tubular
        configuration is connectable to a source of DC electricity, and
        defines a cathode active inner surface and a cathode outer
        surface. An anode is connectable to a source of DC electricity,
        defines an anode active outer surface, and is disposed within
        the cathode to define therewith an annular electrolyte chamber
        disposed between the cathode inner surface and the anode outer
        surface. A separation membrane of tubular configuration is
        disposed within the electrolyte chamber between the cathode and
        the anode to divide the electrolyte chamber into an anode
        sub-chamber and a cathode sub- chamber. The separation membrane
        serves to seal against the passage therethrough of gases. First
        and second gas-tight seals are disposed at, respectively, the
        first and second opposite ends of the cell. A gas tale-off
        connection is in liquid- and gas-flow communication with the
        electrolyte chamber for removing from the cell gases generated
        in the electrolyte chamber. [0006] In accordance with another
        aspect of the invention, the gas take-off connection is
        dimensioned and configured to remove gas generated in the
        cathode sub-chamber separately from gas generated in the anode
        sub-chamber. [0007] In another aspect of the invention, the
        cathode, separation membrane and anode are all disposed
        coaxially relative to each other, and the cathode inner surface,
        the anode outer surface and the separation membrane are each of
        circular configuration in transverse cross section.<br>
        <br>
        Other aspects of the present invention provide that the
        electrolyzer cell may further comprise a pressure vessel
        separate from and surrounding and contacting the outer surface
        of the cathode or, alternatively, the cathode itself may
        comprise a pressure vessel. In either case, one aspect of the
        invention provides that the pressure vessel is capable of
        containing gas at an elevated pressure, wluch elevated pressure
        is at least about 10 psig. In some cases, the elevated pressure
        is not greater than about 10,000 psig, e.g., is not greater than
        about 5,000 psig. [0009] Yet ailother aspect of the present
        invention provides that at least one of the gas-tight seals
        comprises an anode-sealing collar affixed to the anode adjacent
        one end thereof; an electrical isolation bushing, which may be
        cup-shaped to define a recess in which the anode- receiving
        collar is received, the bushing being affixed to the anode
        between the anode-sealing collar and the one end of the anode,
        the bushing engaging the anode-sealing collar; and an end
        fitting engaging the bushing and providing a gas-tight seal of
        the cathode at one end thereof. [0010] Another aspect of the
        invention provides an electrolyzes comprising a plurality of
        electrolyzes cells as described above, first gas-flow conduits
        connected in liquid- and gas-flow communication between the
        respective cathode sub-chambers of the plurality of cells and a
        first gas collector; and second gas-flow conduits connected in
        liquid- and gas-flow communication between the anode
        sub-chambers of the plurality of cells and a second gas
        collector. [0011] In accordance with a method aspect of the
        present invention there is provided a method of electrolyzing
        water to generate pressurized hydrogen and oxygen therefrom
        utilizing an electrolyzes comprising one or more electrolyzes
        cells. The cells individually comprise (i) a cathode of tubular
        configuration within which a rod-shaped anode is disposed to
        define an annular-shaped electrolyte chamber between the cathode
        and the anode, (ii) a separation membrane of tubular
        configuration disposed within the electrolyte chamber between
        the cathode and the anode to divide the electrolyte chamber into
        an anode sub- chamber and a cathode sub-chamber and seal the
        sub-chambers against gas flow therebetween. The method comprises
        the following steps: (a) introducing an aqueous solution of
        electrolyte, e.g., an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide,
        into both sub-chambers of the electrolyte chamber; (b) applying
        a DC voltage drop across the respective anodes and cathodes of
        the cells to dissociate water into hydrogen at the cathode and
        into oxygen at the anode; and (c) separately withdrawing
        hydrogen and oxygen from the one or more electrolyzes cells.
        [0012] In another method aspect of the present invention, the
        cell further comprises a pressure vessel and the hydrogen and
        oxygen are generated at an elevated pressure of at least about
        10 psig, e.g., a pressure not greater than about 10,000 psig, or
        not greater than about 5,000 psig.<br>
        <br>
        Method aspects of the present invention include one or more of
        the following, alone or in suitable combinations: the pressure
        differential between the hydrogen and oxygen withdrawn from the
        cells is maintained at not more than about 0.25 psig,
        preferably, not more than about 0.2 psig, and more preferably
        not more than about 0.17 psig. [0014] Electrolyte and product
        hydrogen are flowed into a hydrogen separator, electrolyte and
        by-product oxygen are flowed into an oxygen separator, the
        respective electrolyte liquid levels in the hydxogen and oxygen
        separators are sensed and controlled to maintain a pressure
        differential between the hydrogen and oxygen withdrawn from the
        cells of not more than about 0.2 psig. [0015] The electrolyte
        may be, but need not be, recirculated through the electrolyzer
        in a continuous operation. <br>

        <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND SPECIFIC
          EMBODIMENTS THEREOF</b><b><br>
        </b><br>
        Referring to Figures 1, lA and 1B, there is shown a
        gas-generation cell 10 comprising a cathode 12 which also serves
        as an outer containment shell, a separation membrane 14 (Figure
        1B) and an anode 16. Cathode 12 has an inner surface 12a and
        anode 16 has an outer surface 16a. Surfaces 12a and 16a are
        active electrode surfaces which are exposed to, and in contact
        with, a liquid electrolyte 18 which is contained within
        electrolyte chamber 15 of gas-generation cell 10. Electrolyte
        chamber 15 is defined by the space between surfaces 12a and 16a.
        As seen in Figure 1B, separation membrane 14 divides electrolyte
        chamber 15 into an anode sub- chamber 15a containing an anode
        portion 18a of electrolyte 18, and a cathode sub-chamber 15b,
        containing a cathode portion 18b of electrolyte 18. It is seen
        that the anode 16, cathode 12, and separation membrane 14 are
        configured coaxially, with the tubular separation membrane 14
        disposed coaxially within the tubular cathode 12 and the
        rod-shaped anode 16 disposed coaxially within the separation
        membrane 14. As shown in Figure 1B, cathode 12 and separation
        membrane 14 are of annular shape in transverse cross section,
        thereby imparting the same cross-sectional annular shape to the
        anode and cathode sub-chambers 15a and 15b. Cathode 12 is
        separated from the anode and sealed at one end against high
        pressure by seal 13 (Figures 1 and lA). A gas-tight seal 12b
        (Figure 1D) closes the other end of cell 10. Gas-tight seal 12b
        is shown in simplified schematic form for simplicity of
        illustration; its construction will be similar to that of
        gas-tight seal 13 except that, as shown in Figure 1D, the anode
        16 does not protrude through it, but stops short of it. A pair
        of gas tale-off lines 20 and 22 protrude through gas-tight seal
        12b to establish liquid- and gas-flow communication with the
        interior of gas-generation cell 10, as described below. The
        cathode 12 serves as the hydrogen-generating electrode and the
        anode 16 serves as the oxygen-generating electrode. The
        illustrated configuration of cell 10 separates the liquid
        electrolyte 18 into an anode electrolyte portion 18a and a
        cathode electrolyte portion 18b. The liquid electrolyte may be,
        for example, a 25% to 28% by weight KOH aqueous solution
        contained within electrolyte chamber 15, i.e., between the
        electrodes 12, 16 on both sides of the separation membrane 14. A
        plurality of individual gas-generation cells formed in this
        manner may be assembled into an array for use in an
        electrolyzer, as described below. [0025] Upon imposition of a
        direct current ("DC") voltage drop, typically about from 1.5 to
        3 volts, preferably about 2 volts, across cathode 12 and anode
        16, hydrogen gas is generated at cathode 12 within cathode
        sub-chamber 15b of electrolyte chamber 15, and oxygen gas is
        generated at anode 16 within anode sub-chamber 15a of
        electrolyte chamber 15. <br>
        <br>
        [0026] The cathode component may, but need not necessarily, also
        serve as the pressure boundary of the electrolysis cell. That
        is, in some embodiments the cathode also serves as the
        containment or pressure vessel, whereas in other embodiments the
        co-axially disposed anode, separation membrane and cathode may
        all be contained within a pressure vessel, enabling thin- wall
        construction of the cathode as well as the anode. [0027] For
        high pressure generation in cases where the cathode also serves
        as the pressure vessel, the wall thiclcness T of cathode 12 arid
        consequently the outside diameter D of the cell 10 is dictated
        by the desired generation pressure, by material properties such
        as yield strength and electrical conductivity of the metal from
        which cathode 12 is made, and by practical considerations
        limiting the wall thickness of cathode 12 which, as noted above,
        also may serve as the containment vessel of cell 10. For
        inexpensive steel or other suitable metal tube or pipe material,
        consistent with hydrogen embrittlement constraints, there are
        practical limits on the diameter D of individual cells for
        generation at 10,000 prig. These practical limits are imposed by
        practical limits on the wall thickness T of cathode 12 and
        result in a range of diameter D of from about 2 to 3 % inches
        (about 5.1 to 8.9 cm). Generally, the wall thiclcness T may vary
        from about 1/4 to 5/8 inches (about 0.64 to 1.59 cm). The length
        L of the individual cell 10 is determined by the desired
        gas-generation rate, generation pressure, and annular flow gaps.
        Typically, the length L of the cell 10 is from about 2 to 6 feet
        (about 0.61 to 1.83 meters). The annular flow gaps are shown in
        Figure 1B by the radial dimension lines g~ (cathode annular flow
        gap) and ga (anode annular flow gap). Typical dimensions for the
        cathode annular flow gap g~ are from about 3/16 to 3/8 inches
        (about 0.48 to 0.96 cm), and for the anode annular flow gap ga
        are from about 1/8 to 1/4 inches (about 0.32 to 0.64 cm). [0028]
        A simple construction, shown in Figure 1D, is used to maintain
        the balance of pressure across the separation membrane 14 within
        the individual cells 10 to within 2 inches of water (less than
        0.1 psig). Maintaining such pressure balance enables maintaining
        product (hydrogen) purity because the separation membrane 14
        cannot seal against gas leakage at pressure differentials
        exceeding a few inches of water. Gas-tight seal 12b has a
        circular flange 11 on the inside thereof in which is formed a
        groove (unnumbered) within which the end of separation membrane
        14 is received to provide a gas-tight seal between cathode
        disengagement space 19a and anode disengagement space 19b. A
        similar grooved-flange construction may or may not be supplied
        at the inside of seal 13 (Figures 1 and lA) to seal the opposite
        end of separation membrane 14. [0029] Gas off take line 20
        transports hydrogen gas from cathode disengagement space 19a
        (Figure 1D) within cell 10 above the level 1 of cathode
        electrolyte portion 18b of liquid electrolyte 18. Gas tale-off
        line 22 transports oxygen gas from anode disengagement space 19b
        within cell 10 above the level 1' of anode electrolyte portion
        18a of a liquid electrolyte 18. The respective hydrogen and
        oxygen disengagement spaces are isolated from each other by a
        gas- tight bullchead structure (not shown). [0030]' Figure 1C
        shows a second embodiment of the invention, wherein parts
        identical or similar to those of the embodiment of Figure 1B are
        nmnbered 100 higher than the numbers used in Figure 1B. With the
        single exception noted, the parts and their function of cell 110
        of Figure 1C are identical to those of the corresponding parts
        of the embodiment of Figure 1B, and therefore a description of
        their structure and function is not repeated. In cell 110, anode
        112 is not designed to resist the operating pressures of cell
        110, and there is therefore provided a pressure vessel 113 which
        is separate from, but surrounds and contacts, the outer surface
        (unnumbered) of cathode 112. Pressure vessel 113 has end
        portions (not shown) which encase the first and second ends of
        cell 110 to provide an effective pressure vessel for cell 110.
        [0031] The illustrated configuration of cell 10 enables
        optimization of the electrode areas for the cathode and anode.
        Because the gas-generation rate (of hydrogen) at the cathode is
        twice the gas-generation rate (of oxygen) at the anode, the
        respective surface areas of cathode inner surface 12a and anode
        outer surface 16a ideally should have the same 2:1 ratio, or at
        least an approximation thereof, to allow the maximum
        gas-generation rate for a cell of given dimensions. The
        gas-generation rate is normally determined by the surface area
        12a of the cathode for a given material and surface conditions.
        In prior art parallel plate electrode configurations, where the
        anode and cathode are of equal surface area, there is a wasteful
        excess of anode surface area. In contrast, in the coaxial
        configuration of the present invention, the diameter of the
        anode is smaller than the diameter of the cathode as measured at
        its inner surface 12a. The anode (outer) surface area is
        therefore smaller than the inner surface area of the cathode.
        The anode (outer) surface and the cathode inner surface are the
        surfaces in contact with the liquid electrolyte and therefore
        constitute the active electrode surfaces. The respective
        electrode diameters and annular flow gaps can be established to
        create a cathode-to-anode active surface area ratio near or at
        the optimum 2 to 1 value.<br>
        <br>
        Usually, the separation membrane 14 of Figure 1B and the
        separation membrane 114 of Figure 1C will be dimensioned and
        configured so that the volume of sub- chambers 15b and 115b are
        approximately twice the volume of their respective associated
        sub- chambers 15a and 115a. The individual cells 10 are sealed
        by providing a seal between the anode 16 and the containment
        vessel provided by the cathode 12 at each end of the latter. The
        seal must provide low voltage (~2 volts) electrical isolation
        between the anode and cathode as well as sealing the cell 10
        against liquid leakage with internal pressures in the cell of up
        to about 10,000 psig or more. Figure 2 is an illustration of a
        simple and effective seal design. [0033] The seal 13 is
        comprised of four basic components. An anode-sealing collar 24
        is made of metal and is welded to the a~iode 16 at an
        appropriate location to align it with the lower end of cathode
        12 (Figure 1). Collar 24 may alternately be made by machining
        anode 16 from a larger-diameter rod so that collar 24 and anode
        16 are of one-piece, unitary construction. An O- ring groove 24a
        is machined into the bottom end surface (unnumbered) of sealing
        collar 24 to receive an O-ring 24b. An electrical isolation
        bushing 26 is of cup shape and is made of a dielectric material
        to provide an electrical isolation piece through which the anode
        16 passes. Bushing 26 is made from non-conducting material and
        has an O-ring groove (unnumbered) formed about the periphery
        thereof to receive an O-ring 26a. A high-pressure end fitting 28
        is made of metal and provides an end piece through which the
        anode passes a~.id which seals the lower end of the cathode 12
        by means of either threading or welding. The outer diameter of
        the end fitting 28 may be threaded to provide exterior threads
        28a to mate with inner diameter threads (not shown) provided at
        both ends of the inner surface 12a (Figure 1B) of the
        containment vessel wall provided by cathode 12. The end fitting
        may be welded to the lower end of the cathode. Either
        arrangement forms a seal against the high gas pressure generated
        within cathode 12. [0034] An electrical insulating sleeve 30 has
        a sleeve bore 33 extending through it and is disposed within the
        end-fitting bore (unnumbered) extending through high- pressure
        end fitting 28. Anode 16 is received within the sleeve bore 33.
        Electrical insulating sleeve 30 thus serves to maintain
        electrical isolation between the anode 16 and cathode 12 outside
        the pressurized area within cathode 12. Sleeve 30 also has an
        end flange 30a that electrically isolates a nut 32 which is
        threaded onto the anode 16, at threads 17 formed at or near the
        end thereof, and is used to preload and hold the entire assembly
        together. A washer 34 is interposed between nut 32 and end
        flange 30a.<br>
        <br>
        It will be appreciated that the various components, i.e.,
        anode-sealing collar 24, electrical isolation bushing 26, and
        end fitting 28 are so dimensioned and configured as to position
        and maintain anode 16 at the center of the electrolyte chamber
        15 (Figure 1B) defined between cathode 12 and anode 16.
        Structure is similarly provided to position and hold separation
        membraale 14 in place concentrically relative to anode 16 and
        cathode 12. This may be accomplished by one or more suitable
        positioning members which are dimensioned and configured to
        position and maintain separation membrane 14 in place. [0036]
        Referring now to Figure 3, an electrolyzer apparatus 36
        comprises an array 38 of individual cells 10 across each of
        which an electric potential is imposed by an electrical energy
        source provided, in the illustrated embodiment, by a DC
        generator 40. Electrical leads from generator 40 to cells 10 are
        schematically illustrated by electrical leads 42a, 42b. A given
        hydrogen production capacity for electrolyzer apparatus 36 is
        attained by appropriately sizing individual cells 10 and
        selecting an appropriate number of such cells for connection to
        a common manifold system as described below. In use, a method
        for producing hydrogen (with an oxygen by-product) is carried
        out by utilizing an electrolytic apparatus as described above
        ~to produce hydrogen (and oxygen by-product) at an elevated
        pressure of up to 10,000 pounds per square inch gauge ("psig"),
        for example, a pressure range from about 0 to about 10,000 prig.
        The upper end of this pressure range (from about 5,000 to about
        10,000 psig) is uniquely well suited to directly provide
        hydrogen fuel for storage in high-pressure storage vessels of
        hydrogen-based fuel cell-powered automobiles or other self
        propelled vehicles, or portable or stationary devices. Any
        pressure ranges between about 0 to about 10,000 psig may of
        course be used. Typical of such intermediate ranges are
        pressures above about 3,000 prig, e.g., from above about 3,000
        psig to about 10,000 psig; from about 3,500 psig to about 8,000
        psig; and from about 3,500 psig to about 10,000 psig. Generation
        of hydrogen at pressures above 10,000 psig may be feasible in
        certain aspects of the invention, provided that it is
        economically practical for the contemplated use to provide
        pressure vessels and associated equipment capable of sustaining
        such high pressures. [0037] An electrolyte reservoir 44 is
        supplied by make-up water pump 48 with make-up water from water
        treatment and storage zone 46 in order to replenish water which
        was dissociated by electrolysis to provide product hydrogen and
        oxygen. Electrolyte is taken from the electrolyte reservoir 44
        and is fed by supply line 45 to electrolyte-replenishing pump 50
        from which it is transported via electrolyte feed line 51 to an
        electrolyte manifold 52 which supplies the electrolyte liquid to
        individual cells 10 via electrolyte feed lines 54.<br>
        <br>
        Hydrogen gas generated within cells 10 and some electrolyte 18
        (Figure 1B) is removed via gas off take lines 20 and hydrogen
        manifold line 21 to hydrogen separator 56, wherein liquid
        electrolyte 18 (Figure 1B) is separated from the hydrogen gas.
        Hydrogen product from hydrogen separator 56 is flowed via
        hydrogen discharge line 60 and is free to flow through check
        valve 62 and into hydrogen storage tanlc 63, or to use or
        further treatment. Separated electrolyte provides a liquid seal
        within hydrogen separator 56. Hydrogen pressure will continue to
        rise as hydrogen is supplied to the fixed volume storage tank
        63. Similarly, oxygen and liquid electrolyte 18 is removed from
        cells 10 by gas off take lines 22, which supply oxygen manifold
        line 23. The oxygen gas and liquid electrolyte 18 flow via line
        23 to oxygen separator 64 in which liquid electrolyte is
        separated from the oxygen. Separated oxygen flows via oxygen
        discharge line 68 at a rate, which is controlled by oxygen
        pressure regulator 70, to an oxygen storage tans (not shoml) or
        to venting or to use or fixrther treatment. Separated
        electrolyte provides a liquid seal within oxygen separator 64.
        The oxygen flow rate is controlled to maintain the liquid level
        in separator 64 to be equal to the liquid level in separator 56.
        The same operational function could be performed by maintaining
        the pressure in separator 64 to be equal to the pressure in
        separator 56. This allows the individual cells 10 to be operated
        in a flooded condition with the generated gas bubbles passing
        through the gas off take lines 20, 22 leading from each cell to
        the separators 56, 64 and the common reservoir 44. In such mode
        of operation, the levels 1, f of electrolyte 18 shown in Figure
        1D are maintained at a higher level within the apparatus
        illustrated in Figure 3. The electrolyte 18, in such case,
        floods the cells 10, gas take-off lines 20 and 22, hydrogen
        manifold line 21 and oxygen manifold line 23, the electrolyte
        surface level in such case being at level 1 of Figure 4. [0039]
        The separators 56 and 64 are sized in cross-section so as to act
        as a liquid trap preventing or greatly reducing electrolyte
        carry over and loss of potassium hydroxide. Make-up potassium
        hydroxide may be added to the system as needed, e.g., manually
        during shut-downs for periodic maintenance. In addition, the
        oxygen gas exiting the oxygen separator is connected to the gas
        space over the liquid in the electrolyte reservoir to maintain
        reservoir pressure at near cell pressure. This enables the
        electrolyte supply pump to operate as a low differential
        pressure circulator. Make-up water is only added to the
        electrolyte reservoir when level sensors in the reservoir (not
        shown) indicate the need to replenish the reservoir liquid.
        [0040] Check valve 62 allows the hydrogen product gas to flow
        through line 60 into a storage tanlc 63 or to fixrther
        processing or use when the hydrogen gas pressure in cells 10
        exceeds that in line 60, e.g., in the hydrogen storage tank 63.
        A pressure sensor (not shown) acts to automatically shut off the
        electrical current to the electrolyzer apparatus 36 when the
        maximum design pressure in hydrogen storage tank 63 has bean
        reached. [0041] The liquid level in the hydrogen separator 56 is
        sensed by a simple level-sensing device, shown in Figure 4,
        which is mounted on hydrogen separator 56. Level- sensing device
        72 comprises a pair (or more) of electrically isolated probes
        74, 76 that extend into the separator 56 at lengths that define
        the maximum and minimum desired level 1 of liquid electrolyte 18
        in the separator 56 at, respectively, probe tips 74a and 76a.
        The electrically isolating seal is essentially the same design
        as the cathode/anode seal 13 (Figures 1 and lA) described above.
        A low-voltage source 78, typically, less than about 1.5 volts,
        is connected by electrical leads 80, 82 to probes 74, 76 and is
        grounded to separator 56 by electrical ground lead 84.
        Electrical continuity is checlced between the probes 74, 76 and
        the shell of separator 56. If the electrolyte level drops below
        the lower level, i.e., no continuity is found in either probe,
        the electrolyte supply pump 50 is actuated and electrolyte is
        sent to the cells. When electrical continuity is sensed on both
        probes 74 and 76, the electrolyte has reached the maximum level
        and the electrolyte supply pmnp 50 is stopped, and no more
        electrolyte is sent to the cells. If the conductive electrolyte
        is between the two probe lengths, i.e., continuity is found on
        one probe only, the make-up water pump 48 status is left
        unchanged, whether on or off, until one of the two above
        mentioned conditions is met. [0042] The flow of oxygen can be
        easily controlled to minimize the pressure differential between
        the separators (and therefore across the diaphragm) in either of
        two ways: differential pressure sensing, or liquid-level
        sensing. [0043] In the differential pressure-sensing technique,
        the flow from the oxygen separator 64 is controlled by
        pneumatically actuated pressure regulator valve 70. In this case
        the actuator diaphragm (not shown) of valve 70 is connected by
        lines (not shown) to sense the pressure differential between the
        gas in the oxygen separator 64 and hydrogen separator 56, and
        opens to vent the gas space of oxygen separator 64 to maintain a
        set pressure differential. This pressure differential is set at
        near zero, e.g., a pressure differential of about from 0.17 to
        0.2 psig, so that the pressure balance inherently keeps the
        liquid levels in the two separators 56, 64 stable and equal to
        within the differential pressure setting. [0044] In the direct
        liquid-level sensing technique, a liquid-level sensor identical
        to liquid- level sensing of Figure 4 is installed on device 72
        in the oxygen separator 64. In this case the valve 70 regulating
        the flow of gas from the oxygen separator 64 cycles between high
        and low (or on and off) settings. This simple level-control
        scheme is satisfactory for operation of cells<br>
        <br>
        10. The setting of valve 70 is determined by the liquid
        electrolyte level in separator 64 as follows. When the valve 70
        is at its high flow setting and the liquid level in the oxygen
        separator 64 rises and reaches the high level contact (analogous
        to probe tip 74a of Figure 4), the valve 70 is switched to its
        low flow-rate position by a suitable electronic control device
        (not shown). When the valve 70 is in the low flow setting and
        the liquid level drops and reaches the low level contact
        (analogous to probe tip 76a of Figure 4), the valve 70 is
        switched to its high flow-rate position by the control device.
        [0045] In a different embodiment of the present invention, the
        electrolyte is circulated in a continuous recycle operation.
        This continuous-operation embodiment enables the production of
        high-pressure hydrogen with the potential to increase the
        length, and therefore the production rate, for a given cell. In
        the batch mode embodiment described thus far, the individual
        cell length is limited by a combination of the cell dimension
        (flow gap), gas volume generation rate, and bubble rise rate.
        Circulating the electrolyte upward through the cell at
        appropriate rates in a continuous recycle embodiment of the
        invention will increase the bubble rise rate via entrainment and
        allow longer cathode and electrode length for otherwise
        similarly dimensioned cells. To implement this recycle approach
        the separator reservoirs (items 56 and 64 in Figure 3) would be
        altered by adding a return path for the electrolyte from
        separators 56 and 64 back to the electrolyte reservoir (item 44
        in Figure 3). The remainder of the apparatus schematically
        show~l in Figure 3 and the basic control system as described
        above for the batch mode embodiment stays largely unaltered for
        the electrolyte-circulating continuous recycle embodiment.
        [0046] The present invention provides at least the following
        advantages over the prior art. [0047] 1. The coaxial
        anode/cathode configuration allows very high-pressure hydrogen
        generation with practical wall thicl~nesses of conventional
        materials in the containment vessel provided by the cathode 12.
        The value of this invention is further enhanced by the use of
        advanced pressure-containment materials, such as composite
        structures, which may make practical larger individual cell
        sizes at elevated pressures. The co-axial configuration also
        allows optimization of the surface areas of anode 16 and cathode
        12, as described above. [0048] 2. Independent gas/liquid
        separators (such as separators 56, 64) are used for each of the
        hydrogen and oxygen production sides. This allows multiple
        gas-generation cells 10 to be connected to common gas/liquid
        separation vessels (e.g., 56, 64) and the utilization of a
        liquid electrolyte level control system.<br>
        <br>
        13. A novel, low-cost pressure seal design for entry of the
        anode 16 into the gas- generation cell 10 enables satisfaction
        of high-pressure and electrical isolation requirements at
        reasonable cost. [0050] 4. The invention provides a simple,
        inexpensive control strategy for untended operation during
        hydrogen production, including automated control of the level of
        liquid electrolyte 18, or the control of the differential
        pressure between the separators (56 and 64) and release of
        generated hydrogen and oxygen gases, such that high-purity gas
        products are obtained. [0051] The ability of the apparatus and
        method of the present invention to enable hydrogen (and oxygen)
        production at pressures of up to or even exceeding 10,000 psig
        exceeds the highest direct generation pressure of about 3,000
        psig that has been previously reported as attainable from prior
        known electrolyzers. The apparatus and method of the present
        invention can produce such high-pressure hydrogen without need
        for a separate compressor to pressurize the product hydrogen
        gas. Producing 10,000 psig hydrogen is key to supplying
        compressed hydrogen gas for fuel-cell-powered or internal
        combustion engine-powered vehicles at acceptable
        volume-to-weight ratios for onboard storage that yields a
        single- tank driving range equivalent to gasoline powered
        vehicles. The present invention allows high- pressure hydrogen
        production to be performed in a unique way that reduces the
        component cost and system complexity so that the equipment is
        easily affordable by individuals for commuter vehicle home
        fueling and for small fleet fueling applications. The invention
        is scalable to any given production capacity and is also
        practical for service-station type applications for dispensing
        of hydrogen to fuel-cell-powered vehicles and equipment. [0052]
        The apparatus and method of the present invention rnay be
        utilized to generate pressurized hydrogen on site at locations
        such as service stations for hydrogen fuel cell-powered
        automobiles; service stations, hardware/home improvement stores,
        and local energy distributors for retail sale of hydrogen fuel
        via high-pressure canisters; and in residences, factories and
        office buildings for on-site energy storage and/or use in fuel
        cell or internal combustion engine- based portable power supply
        or home, garden or other appliance applications. &nbsp;<br>
