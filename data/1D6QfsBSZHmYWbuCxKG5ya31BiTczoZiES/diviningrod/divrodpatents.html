      <b>SPECIFICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a one-hand test rod having a handle
      portion to which a flexible indicator portion is attached, said
      indicator portion being formed as a straight wire at one end of
      which a terminal element is arranged, and the other end of which
      is connected to one end of said handle portion which is formed as
      a metallic tube.<br>
      <br>
      Such test rods which are also named dowsing rods, are known and
      described e.g. in DE OS 30 27 367 and DE-GM 82 24 305. They are
      used e.g. for tracing threads of water and mineral resources, or
      for carrying out other investigations, e.g. tracing so-called
      "irritating stripes" on the ground surface.<br>
      <br>
      One-hand test rods of the aforementioned type are characterized by
      the fact that, with their help, investigations can also be carried
      out by persons having only little practice.<br>
      <br>
      The problem underlying the present invention was seen in the
      further development df a one-hand test rod as described above and
      as mentioned in the preamble to claim 1 to the end that the
      sensibility and precision of measurements which are carried out by
      means of the test rod, can be considerably increased.<br>
      <br>
      The aforementioned problem is solved by the features which are
      contained in the characterizing clause of claim 1.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred embodiments of the claimed test rod are described in the
      subclaims.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is based on the perception that, by displacing the
      tuning element within the tube of the handle portion, a tuning
      operation can be obtained which does not only increase the
      exactness of measurements carried out by means of the test rod to
      a considerable extent, but, which, in many cases, forms the only
      possibility for finding out certain particular spots or regions in
      space in which the conditions clearly distinguish from those in
      the environment. In such spots or regions, the indicator portion
      of the test rod will begin to vibrate, especially its terminal
      element will carry out a circular spinning motion. As can be
      observed, a displacement of the tuning element within the tube
      will increase, decrease or entirely stop the vibration.It has
      further turned out that, upon adjustment of the tuning element in
      different positions within the tube, different spots and regions
      in space will bring about the optimal sensibility or exactness of
      the measuring operation, i.e. the maximum deflection of the
      indicator portion.<br>
      <br>
      Since the phenomena causing the deflection of such test rod have
      not yet been definitely cleared in a scientifically acknowledged
      manner, attention is directed only to the fact that the one-hand
      test rod according to the invention behaves as if the tube of the
      handle portion together with the displaceable tuning element,
      forms an electric resonant circuit, e.g. a cavity resonator as
      used in microwave techniques, in which cavity resonator a
      resonance condition, e.g. a standing electric wave, is built up
      upon adjustment of an electrically conductive tuning element in
      different positions. It has been found out that the test rod
      according to the invention provides for the possibility of
      obtaining a very accurate tuning to these "resonant positions",
      and that the results are well reproducible.<br>
      <br>
      The one-hand test rod according to the invention will be further
      described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying
      drawing showing, in longitudinal section, one embodiment of the
      one-hand test rod.<br>

      <br>
      To one end of a handle portion 1 which is formed as a cylindrical
      tube, an indicator portion 2 is coaxially attached, said indicator
      portion being formed as an elongated wire.<br>
      <br>
      The tube 1 is made of electrically highly conductive material.
      E.g., a copper tube having a diameter of 22 mm can be used. The
      wire 2 can likewise be made of electrically conductive material
      such as brass. The front end of the tube 1 is closed by a plug 8
      made of electrically non-conductive material, e.g. a plastics
      material. The plug 8 is provided with a central bore. The rearward
      end of the tube 1 is closed by a plug 7 made of electrically
      conductive material, e.g. brass. Both plugs 7 and 8 form also a
      holder for a guide element which is in the form of a bar 9. The
      bar 9 can be made of metal or of an electrically nonconductive
      material such as plastics material.<br>
      <br>
      A tuning element 4 is longitudinally slideably arranged within the
      tube 1. The tuning element 4 is made of electrically conductive
      material such as copper or brass. It can be formed cylindrically,
      whereby the cross-section of the tube is partially filled up, and
      an electrically well-conductive connection with the inner wall of
      the tube is established through a projection 4a. The bar 9 passes
      through a central bore of the tuning element 4 so that the latter
      can slide along the bar 9 within the tube. In the outer surface of
      the tube 1 an elongated slot 1a is provided, said slot extending
      over part of the length of the tube and ending near the two ends
      thereof. A stud or bolt 5 passes through the slot 1 a which stud
      is screwed into the tuning element 4. A knob 6 is secured to the
      outer end of the stud 5 for manual actuation.<br>
      <br>
      The terminal element which is attached to the free end of the wire
      2, is formed as a conical wire helix 3 whereby the wire can be
      made of the same material as the wire 2. The tip 3a of the conical
      wire helix is firmly connected to the tip 2a of the straight wire,
      and the wire helix 3 is arranged in such a way that its base 3b
      faces towards the handle portion.<br>
      <br>
      On the outer surface of the tube 1, a measuring scale (not shown
      can be provided by means of which the relative position of tuning
      element 4 within the tube can be read off. Further, in a manner
      not shown, the actuating element can be provided with a catch
      member by means of which the tuning element 4 can be locked in a
      certain position.<br>
      <br>
      This catch member can e.g. be formed so that the stud 5 is adapted
      to be screwed into the tuning member 4 to such an extent that the
      actuating knob 6 rests on the outer wall of the tube thereby
      forming a catch member. Further, a spring element (not shown) can
      be provided against the force of which the tuning element 4 can be
      slideably adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      The above described one-hand test rod is operated as follows. The
      handle portion of the test rod is grasped by hand, preferably such
      that the thumb of the hand rests on the actuating knob 6. The
      indicator portion, with its forward end, is moved towards the spot
      or region in space which is to be investigated.<br>
      <br>
      Simultaneously, through the knob 6, the tuning element 4 is
      displaced until a deflection is observed to the end that, e.g.,
      the terminal element carries out a circular movement. By moving
      the tuning element 4 forth and back, it is easy to adjust the most
      sensitive position of the measurement, namely the greatest
      deflection at the forward end of the indicator portion. The
      corresponding position of the tuning element 4 can be read from a
      measuring scale which may be provided adjacent to the elongated
      slot la of the tube 1. By means of the tuning element in a fixed
      or, possibly, locked position, it is easy to carry out further
      measurements by searching for spots or regions in space in which a
      deflection of the indicator portion occurs when the test rod has
      been tuned in this way.<br>
      <br>
      In practical tests it has been found out that different but
      reproducible positions of the tuning element 4 can be associated
      with different spots or regions in space which may also be
      influenced by the presence of persons, animals or plants. In this
      case, too, the test rod according to the invention behaves in a
      manner as if phenomena were observed to which differing resonance
      conditions or, in connection with a cavity resonator, differing
      natural frequencies or natural wave lengths, respectively, can be
      associated.<br>

      Apparatus for influencing or suppressing the forces giving rise to
      divining rod reactions is itself provided with a wire screening
      means, thereby extending its area of effectiveness. The apparatus
      for influencing the rod reactions comprises a wooden box in which
      metal plates and wires are disposed in a particular manner. This
      box is placed at the mid-point of two perpendicularly crossed
      pairs of parallel wooden supports which also carry a continuous
      wire ring, the centre of which coincides with the mid-point of the
      box. In a larger type of equipment the main components are placed
      in a concrete pit below ground level and the shielding ring is
      placed outside the pit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>COMPLETE SPECIFICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to apparatus for influencing forces which
      give rise to divining rod reactions, and to a method of
      influencing such forces.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments show that the location of water, ore and oil layers,
      pipe lines, electric cables, and similar objects in the ground may
      be determined by means of a divining rod handled by a susceptible
      person.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, forces giving rise to divining rod reactions occur above
      sharply defined tracks on the earth surface, such that a
      deflection of the divining rod is always observed above and does
      not occur outside the same, although the presence of these tracks
      can be sensed by the diviner at a distance. For the sake of
      simplicity, the force or influence concentrated in these tracks,
      and causing deflection of the divining rod, is known by diviners
      as (( earth-rays."<br>
      <br>
      The physical nature of such " earth rays " has not yet been
      established. In particular, it is not certain whether a radiation
      in a physical sense actually occurs, although it has been assumed
      that the influence is due to reflection of cosmic radiation by
      certain parts of the earth surface. In certain cases, it has been
      possible to check the course of the tracks by the divining rod
      with the aid of physical apparatus, such as the
      Geiger-Muller-counter. In experiments, wherein a diviner was
      connected with a cardiagraph, distinct variations of the
      cardiagram have been observed upon passing the said tracks.<br>
      <br>
      As for scientific literature on this subject, attention may be
      directed, for instance, to the book by J. Cecil Maby and T.
      Bedford Franklin: " The Physics of the Divining Rod " (1939).<br>
      <br>
      Hereinafter, the physical nature of the earth-rays " will will be
      left out of consideration. The term " earth-rays " will only be
      used as naming the forces which bring about a deflection of the
      divining rod above certain tracks on the earth surface, the nature
      of these forces being unknown, although their existence cannot be
      denied.<br>
      <br>
      Various scientific experiments and verifiable solitary cases point
      to a certain correlation between the occurrence of the forces
      indicated as "earth-rays and the state of health of people,
      animals and plants, to the effect that a prolonged stay above one
      of these tracks would cause or enhance a disposition for certain
      diseases and aberrations, the degree of this disposition being
      dependent on the condition and the susceptibility of the exposed
      individual.<br>
      <br>
      Hence, devices for influencing, and in particular for suppressing
      the forces indicated as " earth-rays " have not only a scientific
      value from the point of view of their use as a means of
      experiments, but are also valuable in the interest of public
      health and of the economy of agriculture and cattle-breeding.
      Experiments as indicated above have also been extended to the
      practical results of such devices and have confirmed the effect
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Hitherto, various difficulties were involved in the experiments
      with such devices (of which a very effective species will be
      described hereinafter), and in the permanent installation thereof,
      because the effect of the device appeared to be very variable.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based on a recognition which has been
      confirmed by numerous experiments, to wit that the effect of the
      said devices is severely interfered with, or even completely
      suppressed when the devices are positioned within a track in which
      the reactions to be suppressed occur, or when metal objects are
      brought into the vicinity of the devices.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, a permanent supervision of the devices on the spot was
      necessary, in particular because the course of the earth-rays is
      subject to variations, so that an apparatus initially located
      outside such a track can come to lie within the same.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has for its object to remove these disadvantages.
      According to the invention, the apparatus which, as explained
      hereinbefore, serves to obtain a screening effect and to keep a
      certain area free from the influence of the earth-rays, is
      provided in its turn with wire screen- ing means.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose it has been fbund to be particularly effective to
      surround the apparatus exerting the geophysical influence with a
      metal ring. The range within this ring, wherein the apparatus is
      located, is free from the influence of earth-rays, and the
      detrimental influence of metal objeets brought close to the
      apparatus is found to be removed- at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the said ring is used in combination with a screening
      by means of crossed wires. If such crossed wires are arranged in a
      suitable manner underneath the apparatus, they act to make the
      effect of the apparatus independent of the influence of
      earth-rays, and if- used in combination with the said ring they
      support the action of the latter; Moreover, the crossed wires
      provide an additional protection for instance in- case the effect
      of the ring is eliminated. It has been found that such elimination
      of the effect of the ring m,ay be caused by grounding, and, of
      course, a grounding of the ring might occur involuntarily. This
      additional protection is also effective with respect to disturbing
      objects -underneath the apparatus, such as metallic waterpipes,
      and the like; Favourable results have been obtained with a ring
      made of soft copper and with crossed wires of the same material.
      Preferably, the copper consists of so-called annealed wire.<br>
      <br>
      The exact nature of the invention, - and various additional
      objects thereof, will be apparent from the following description,
      given with reference to the accompanying drawings. In this
      description, an apparatus will be disclosed which is adapted to be
      used to advantage in combination with screening means according to
      the invention, and it will be shown in what manner the invention
      is to be performed, with respect to constructive details and to
      the arrangement of the various parts, in order to obtain the most
      favourable results.<br>

      <br>
      As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the apparatus to be screened is
      enclosed in a wooden casing 29, and comprises. two spaced
      juxtaposed elements 1 and 2, each consisting of two horizontal
      plates 11, 14 and 16, 19 respectively, lying one above the other,
      and of a plurality of wire-like members 15 and 20. Corresponding
      parts of both elements, i.e., the plates 11 and 16, the wire-like
      members 15 and 20, and the plates 14 and 19 lie at the same level.
      The plates -11-, 14,-16 and 19 are made of a material of good
      electrical conductivity, preferably copper, and the wire-like
      members are made of a precious metal, preferably silver. The
      plates of one of said elements, in the present case the plates 16
      and 19, are provided with a continuous coating of another metal,
      In case copper is used for the plates, this coating consists of
      nickel. However, the plates may also be made of silver, and in
      that case the coating of the plates 16 and 19 consists of gold.<br>
      <br>
      The upper plates 11, 16 of both elements are covered by lead
      plates 13 and 18 respectively, which serve to protect the elements
      against influences from above, and which are separated from the
      plates 11 and 16 by insulating layers 12 and 17 respectively,
      which may consist of a fibrous material. The middle part of the
      apparatus is likewise covered by a lead plate 40 having a
      thickness of about 0.12 inches, which is supported at its centre
      by wooden blocks 44 and 45 attached to the sides of the wooden
      casing of the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the wire-like members 15 and 20 of each of the
      elements 1 and 2 are formed as three parallel wires placed at the
      same level, the middle one of these wires having a circular, and
      the outside ones a rectangular, cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      The distance between the wire-like members 15, 20 and the lower
      horizontal plates 14, 19 is greater, preferably about three times
      greater than the distance between the said members and the upper
      horizontal plates 11, 16. The distance between the elements 1 and
      2 may amount to several times, and preferably to about four times.
      the distance between the upper and lower plates of each element.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 further shows a plurality of strips 21-28 located on both
      sides of the lower plates 14 and 19 in such a manner that
      corresponding strips of both elements are in alignment with each
      other. These strips have been found to enhance the effect of the
      apparatus. The strips 21-24 on both sides of the plate 14 are made
      of copper and the strips 25-28 on both sides of the plate 19 are
      made of brass.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the strips 21, 23, 26 and 27 lying nest to the plates
      14 and 19 are narrower than the outside strips 22, 24, 25 and 28.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus is arranged in the wooden casing 29, wherein the use
      of metallic fastening means, such as nails and the like, has been
      avoided. As shown in the drawings, the various parts are supported
      by skeleton boards or frames 5-10, slid into grooves 3, 4 in the
      side walls of the casing. The casing, which is preferably made of
      plywood or of mahogany, protects the parts against humidity.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the casing is provided with vent holes. 41, 42.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, good results have been obtained with an apparatus
      wherein the dimensions of the various parts and the distance
      between these parts are approximately as follows: lead plates 13
      and 18 - - - - - - - - 1.6 x 1.6 . x 0.12 inches plates 11, 14, 16

      0.08 inches strips 22, 24, 25, 28 - - - - - - - - 2.6 x 0.16 x

      inches distance between wires 20 and plate 19. 2.8 inches distance
      between centres of plates 11 and 16 - - - - - 12.0 inches<br>
      <br>
      By means of an apparatus having these dimensions, the divining rod
      reactions caused by " earth-rays may be completely suppressed, or
      at least considerably weakened in an area having a diameter of
      about 130 feet. The working range of the apparatus may be greatly
      increased, however, by enlarging the apparatus and the parts
      thereof, while substantially maintaining the proportions as
      indicated.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to Figures 3 and 4, it will be seen that the
      apparatus to be screened is provided at its bottom 29 with a
      cross-shaped wooden structure of which the legs extend beyond the
      apparatus and support the ring 30. This cross-shaped structure
      consists of four beams 31-34.<br>
      <br>
      The beams 31 and 32 are in parallel with each other, whereas the
      beams 33 and 34 are likewise in parallel with each other, but at
      right angles to the beams 31 and 32. The beams enclose a
      rectangular space 35, wherein crossed metal wires. 36, 37 and 38
      are located. These wires may simply be laid in slots provided in
      the beams, and covered by a wooden plate 39, preferably consisting
      of plywood. The dimensions are such that the casing of the
      apparatus shown in Figures 1 and 2 can enter the space 35 so as.
      to rest on the plate 39. This prevents a lateral displacement of
      the casing, whilst the assembly may be readily taken apart for
      inspection. The double bottom 29, 39 between the crossed wires and
      the elements 1 and 2 is found to be of importance in preventing a
      reduction of the effect of the apparatus which might otherwise
      occur due to direct influence of the metal wires 36, 37, 38 on the
      elements 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      As indicated by the dotted lines. 46, the walls of the casing 29
      may be downwardly extended so as to enclose the metal wires 36, 37
      and 38 therebetween. In this way the crossed wires are included in
      the apparatus and may be entered into the space 35 of the
      cross-shaped structure, and removed from that space together with
      the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 4, the copper wires or rods 36, 37 and 38 are
      arranged in such a manner that the wire 36 lies in a vertical
      plane through the centres of the plates 11, 14, 16 and 19 of the
      elements 1 and 2, whereas a wire 37 or 38 crossing the
      first-mentioned wire 36, is centrally positioned underneath each
      of the elements 1 and 2.<br>
      <br>
      The ring 30 is made of copper wire with a diameter of about 0.2
      inches, and the diameter of the ring amounts to about 28 inches.
      The ring is attached to the cross-shaped structure 31-34 by means
      of fastening means, such as brackets and nails, made of the same
      material as the ring. The same procedure is also applied to the
      strips 21-24 and 25-28 mentioned hereinbefore, these strips being
      attached by the aid of fastening means made of copper, and brass,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      As appears from Figure 4, the ring 30 lies in a plane parallel to
      the plates of the elements 1 and 2 and immediately below the lower
      plates thereof, and the apparatus is centrally arranged within the
      ring. This arrangement of the apparatus and the ring must be
      maintained in order to obtain satisfactory results.<br>
      <br>
      An additional advantage of the use of the ring 30 will now be
      explained. For this purpose the effect of the apparatus without
      the ring 30 will first be described, considering a horizontal
      plane at substantially the same level as the wire-like members 15
      and 20. Above this plane, the forces giving rise to divining rod
      reactions are influenced to such an extent that the said reactions
      re substantially suppressed within the working range of the
      apparatus. Immediately below the said plane, the divining rod
      reactions continue to occur. Hence, it has been necessary to place
      the apparatus at some distance below the earth surface in order to
      be certain that protection against " earth-rays " would be
      effective immediately above the same. For this reason, the devices
      have been placed, for instance, in a concrete pit. In buildings,
      the devices have preferably been placed underneath the ground
      floor which involved additional labour and impeded the supervision
      of the devices.<br>
      <br>
      These disadvantages are substantially removed by the use of the
      ring 30. In fact, it has been found that the ring 30 has the
      effect of lowering the plane, above which the protective action is
      obtained, at least 20 inches, so that it is made possible to place
      the apparatus above the floor.<br>
      <br>
      The position of the apparatus with respect to the magnetic
      meridian is of great importance. This position must be such that
      the common centre line of the elements 1 and 2 is perpendicular to
      the plane of the magnetic meridian, and that the element
      comprising the uncoated plates 11, 14 is at the east side. The
      arrow P shown in Figure 3 points to the north in that case.<br>
      <br>
      The cross-shaped structure 31-34 used in accordance with the
      present invention offers a good opportunity to facilitate this
      arrangement and the supervision thereof, because the said
      structure may now be provided with a compass 43. As shown in
      Figures 3 and 4, this compass is arranged on the leg 33 extending
      beyond the apparatus. Thus, the apparatus need only be placed in
      such a position that the compass needle lies above an index line
      of the compass marked N, which is in parallel to the arrow P shown
      in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
      <br>
      A slight deviation from the above-mentioned position of the
      apparatus will lead to a reduced effect.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a ring around the apparatus, and of a grid of crossed
      wires underneath the same is not limited to an apparatus according
      to the above-described embodiment, but is - also effective for
      other apparatus having a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      For protecting a larger area, such as a village or a residential
      quarter of a city, against the forces to be influenced, larger
      apparatus is used, for instance with a working range of about 250
      feet. Figure 6 schematically indicates a residential quarter, the
      parts enclosed by straight lines representing housing blocks, and
      the parts lying between the blocks representing streets and
      squares. Four groups of lines 47-50 drawn through the blocks
      represent " earth-ray tracks," within which the forces to be
      influenced are concentrated. A plurality of apparatuses 51 are
      each surrounded by a dottedcircle indicating the working range of
      each apparatus. It will be seen that the position of the apparatus
      has been chosen in such a manner that the working ranges overlap.
      For instance, the apparatus may be spaced at distances of about
      125 feet.<br>
      <br>
      It will also be apparent from the drawing that all housing blocks
      are protected against the influence of the " earth rays." Most of
      the apparatus are placed outside the housing blocks, where they
      may be most easily arranged. For this purpose, it is an advantage
      to make use of concrete pits 52 with water-tight walls as shown in
      Figure 5. These pits may have a cylindrical shape, and the
      screening ring 30 may be placed around the pit at the outside
      thereof. In order to adjust the ring to the desired level, it may
      be supported by a circular edge 53 forming a part of the concrete
      wall of the pit. In this case, the ring 30 is covered by an
      electrically insulating, chemically resistant, water-proof layer,
      which may consist of a plastic, for instance.<br>
      <br>
      A similar covering may also be used on the ring of the embodiment
      shown in Figures 3 and 4 when used indoors, ill order to prevent
      the ring from being grounded l)y contacting metal parts.<br>
      <br>
      The pit 52 is closed by a concrete cover 54 arranged at street
      level. <br>

      Inventor(s): PHILIPP SCHERMULY<br>
      <br>
      Addition to GB146840. In prospecting and water-finding, a
      cartridge of suitable reacting-material is contained in a two-part
      capsule s, the parts being preferably threaded together and
      containing perforated bearings t whereby a layer of air surrounds
      the cartridge; the capsule is suspended from a divining-rod as
      described in the parent Specification. The reacting substance is
      preferably of the same nature as the substance sought for, but a
      mixture of specified metals may be employed in water-finding. The
      apparatus is stated to be applicable for testing and analysing
      purposes. The Specification as open to inspection under Sect. 91
      (3) (a) states also that a capsule as above may be employed
      suspended from a cord held by the operator. This subject-matter
      does not appear in the Specification as accepted.<br>
      <br>
      This invention constitutes an improvement in or modification of
      the invention of prior Application for Letters Patent No. 146,840
      and relates to apparatus of the divining rod type used for
      indicating the presence of treasures of the soil, e.{. water,
      minerals or metals, petroleum [naptha), coals and the like, or for
      testing or analysing substances, by means of substances physically
      or chemically reacting on the emanations.<br>
      <br>
      Dynamic effects radiated by treasures of the,oil, in such a manner
      that by carrying reacting substances into the sphere of action of
      the emanations radiated by treasures to be searched for 2.5 or by
      substances to be tested or analysed, they are either attracted or
      repelled, and the object of my present invention is to strengthen
      this action of the dynamical effects on the reacting substances
      contained within a capsule or casing as far as possible an(d to
      ensure therefore a rapid and sure setting of my apparatus carrying
      the capsule in the direction of the treasure of the soil or of the
      substance to be tested or analysed and furthermore to render it
      possible to easily and rapidly exchange one reacting substance for
      another.<br>
      <br>
      With this object in view my device for holding the reacting
      substance to be used consists essentially of a capsule made in two
      parts adapted easily to be opened and closed, nd having, bearings
      within it for holding the reacting substance and being of somewhat
      greater diameter than the 45 cartridge of reacting substance so
      that a continuous layer of air surrounds the reacting substance
      within the capsule.<br>
      <br>
      I am aware that it is known to use a composition made up of gold,
      silver, 50 quicksilver and copper, placed in a small vial or flask
      together with a quantity of dilute nitric or tartaric acid or pure
      alcohol as a means for discovering precious metals by the process
      commonly,55 known as divination, this composition, if there are
      any precious metals in the neighborhood, being attracted by such
      metals, the flask, suspended by means of a string held, preferably
      by the thumb 60 and forefinger of the right hand, moving toward
      the metals at first and then vibrating, thus indicating the
      presence of the metal sought for.<br>
      <br>
      In opposition to this known gold and 65 silver finder my present
      invention has the great advantages that, by means of the
      arrangement of a layer of air surrounding the cartridge of
      reacting substance within the capsule or casing, it will be
      possible 70 on the one hand to strengthen the action of the
      dynamical effects radiated by the treasures of the soil or by the
      substances to be tested or analysed on the reacting substance
      within the capsule and on the 75 other hand, by suspending the
      capsule to the free end of the swinging branch of my apparatus as
      described and shown in my prior Specification Serial No. 146,840
      to ensure a more rapid and sure setting 80 of the apparatus
      carrying the capsule in the direction of the treasure sought for,
      not only if this is in the immediate neighborhood, but also at
      great distances. - 85 Myv invention will be fully described
      147,186 with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: <br>

      <br>
      In these figures e is the reacting substance, which preferably has
      the form of a cartridge both ends of which are rounded off, and r
      is a capsule or casing made of two parts for receiving and
      carrying the cartridge e of reacting substance during the
      operation of searching for treasures of the soil or of testing' or
      analysing substances. The two parts of the capsule are preferably,
      screw-threaded as shown at s, for the purpose of joining them
      together in a manner more or less air-tight. That part of the
      capsule which, in its position for use, will be the lower one, may
      advantageously be tapered off to form a plummet.<br>
      <br>
      In the interior of the two parts of the capsule r bearings t, t
      are arranged preferably near the top and bottom for the purpose of
      receiving the ends of the cartridge e of reacting substance and
      retaining them firmly when the capsule is closed. These bearings
      t, t are preferably perforated and fixed by means of narrow
      bridges to the interior surface of the capsule r.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this arrangement is to provide a continuous layer or
      mantle r of air between the interior surface of the capsule or
      casing r and the cartridge e of the reacting substance within it.<br>
      <br>
      The capsule r may removably be fixed or; suspended to an apparatus
      of the kind shown and described in my prior Specification Serial
      No. 146,840 by means of a hook and eye u or by any other suitable
      way.<br>
      <br>
      The mode of operation of the arrangement described as before is as
      follows:For the purpose of searching for a treasure of the soil of
      any predetermined kind or for testing, or analysing substances,
      the capsule r is opened by separating the two parts of it from one
      another, a cartridge of a substance exactly reacting to the
      emanations radiated by this treasure, put into the capsule and the
      two parts of it closed again. Then, the reacting substance within
      the capsule -r is surrounded by a continuous laver of air, which
      if a treasure of the soil is present, may immediately be saturated
      s0 with emanations radiated by this treasure.<br>
      <br>
      By this fact an action as strong as possible is exerted on the
      reacting substance and by this moreover the substance takes
      rapidly and exactly the direction of the actually present treasure
      or a direction 65 opposite to this.<br>
      <br>
      The reacting substances to be used are generally the same as the
      treasures of the soil to be searched for or the substances to b)e
      tested or analysed. So e.y. for indicating the presence of water,
      petroleum, coals, gold and the like, the most suitable reacting
      substances to be used are again water, petroleum, coal, gold and
      the like. 75 For the better understanding of my invention I shall
      describe same by way of example in connection with finding sweet
      water. I open the capsule ', enclose therein a cartridge e
      containing 8( sweet water, close the capsule again tight and
      attach the same b v means of the hook and eve ut to the free end
      of the inclined swinging branch a of my apparatus as described and
      shown in prior Specification Serial No. 146,840.<br>
      <br>
      As to the exact forces causing the apparatus to work as described
      1 do not intend to make a definite statement though at the present
      state of develop- 9( menit of the method it occurs to me that the
      air surrounding the substance e within the capsule r, i.e. the
      water in the cartridge e, appears to be gradually saturated with
      emanations radiated by 91 the water inll the oround. A strong
      reaction takes place between the water ill the cartridge and that
      in the ground, the emanations causing the swinging branch a of my
      apparatus to move laterally and, if strong enough, imparting
      rotation to the whole apparatus around its axis.<br>
      <br>
      Any organic or mineral, or metallic substance in, as well as
      above, the ground 10 answers my method if I put a cartridge.<br>
      <br>
      formed of the same substance as that expected inl the ground, as a
      reacting substance into the capsule r. In such cases where a
      mineral of unknown character I( is supposed to be in the ground I
      therefore put one reacting substance after another into the
      capsule r, and carry the apparatus with the capsule into the
      sphere of action of the emanations radiated by 11I this substance
      until I find the one reacting substance which is so near in its
      character, or nature, to the substance in the ground that it
      causes the apparatus to work in the manner described. It occurs
      121 occasionally that a reacting substance does not work readily
      enough upon the apparatus because the composition of the reacting-
      substance does not correspond to that of the substance in the
      ground. In 12, this case the reacting substance is modified in its
      composition until one is found which causes the apparatus to
      rotate or swing in the most definite manner. In locating a
      substance in the ground I am not always restricted to the use of a
      reacting substance of the same kind, or nature, as I have found
      that there are often several substances of good indicating power
      for the same substance. For instance I can also find water by
      using a cartridge of a mixture of tungsten, steel, metallic
      copper, metallic nickel, metallic manganese and metallic mercury,
      the results being as good as with water itself as a reacting
      substance.<br>
      <br>
      For using my apparatus, with the cartridge of reacting substance e
      as described before, for testing or analysing substances of
      unknown character, I proceed in the same manner as described
      before, that is to say, I open the capsule, put a cartridge of
      reacting substance into the capsule, close it again tightly,
      attach the same to the free end of the swinging branch of my
      apparatus, bring it into the sphere of action of the emanations
      radiated by the substances to be tested or analysed, wait for some
      time till the mantle of air surrounding the cartridge or reactingÃ€
      substance within the capsule r may be saturated with the
      emanations and if no action of the apparatus may be seen, I
      exchange the cartridge of reacting substance used for another and
      I proceed in this manner until I find the one reacting substance
      being near in its character, or nature, to the substance to be
      tested or analysed or to one of its constituents that it causes
      the apparatus to work in the manner as described in my prior
      Specification Serial No. 146,840.<br>

      Prospecting and water-finding. - Minerals, coal, water, oil,
      &amp;c. are located by divining-rod apparatus comprising a rod a
      of steel, iron, copper, or other metal, or of a combination of
      metals, or of wood, rattan, whalebone, &amp;c. which is suitably
      coiled to form elastically - connected branches, one branch being
      supported in bearings b and the other branch, which passes through
      a slotted graduated guide c, being graduated and free to oscillate
      and adjustably carrying a spring or slide d to which is suspended
      a reacting substance or a container e therefor. In a modification,
      two rods a, Fig. 3, are pivoted on a stud g by means of a spring
      ring h. The apparatus may be inverted and is stated to be
      applicable for analysing and testing purposes. The reacting
      substance is preferably of the same nature as the substance sought
      for, but sulphur may be employed in gold-finding and a mixture of
      specified metals in water-finding. Specification 979/12 is
      referred to.<br>
      <br>
      My invention has reference to improvements in or relating to
      apparatus used for indicating the presence of treasures of the
      soil, i.e. water, minerals or metals, petroleum (naphtha), coals
      and the like, asl is the case in using a divining rod in the well
      known manner, and the object of mv improvements is to indicate the
      presence and the resting place of such treasures in a surer and
      more rapid manner than has hitherto been the case and furthermore
      to serve as an appliance for testing or analysing substances.<br>
      <br>
      This invention is based on the discovery that emanations
      (dynamical effects) radiated by certain kinds of treasures)
      physically react on certain other substances suspended in such a
      way that these substances, in the following called " reacting
      substances," may either be attracted or repelled by these
      emanations.<br>
      <br>
      I am aware that in the British Specification No. 979 A.D. 1912 a
      device for locating the presence of water minerals and the like,
      has been proposed in which a recording device is provided in
      conjunction with a divining rod for recording the amount of
      attraction or pull upon the same when in use. But in [., this
      device the rod is of usual shape with a fork the two branches of
      which are rigidly secured to one another and the ends of these
      branches bent at right angles are journaled in bearings in a 45
      frame or casing so that the fork may only move in the manner of
      the usual divining rod, that is to say, in a vertical direction
      and the recording device connected to the rod may only give an 50
      indication from the degree of attraction exerted from the water,
      minerals or the like on the rod itself and therefore from the
      depth at which the liquid or mineral sou',ht is located in the
      ground. 55 With my invention on the contrary, by using a device
      comprising, a fork made of two elastically combined branches, one
      of which forms the axis of rotation of the device, the other being
      60 free to swing vertically to the first-named and detachably
      carrying a cartridge of substance reacting on the emanations
      radiated bv the treasures of the soil or other substances, I am
      able 65 to determine the kind or nature of this treasure or
      substance, and to read off the amount of rotation of the device on
      one scale and the amount of attraction or repulsion of the
      swinging branch of the 70 rod on another scale and in this manner
      to fix in all eases the thickness, depth of resting and quality of
      the treasure of the soil as specified before on the basis of
      practical knowledge and calculation, so that mv invention wholly
      differs from that which is known not only in its arrangement but
      also in its means of operation, its mode of working and results.
      My invention will be fully described with reference to the
      accompanying drawings, in which, Fig. 1 is a side view of the
      apparatus made ill accordance with the invention, Fig. 2 is a
      front view of the same and Figs. o to 5 are details of modified
      constructions of this apparatus.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      In carrying out my invention I employ a thin rod of ally suitable
      cross-section and material, such as metal, steel, iron, copper and
      the like, or of a combination of metals, of wood, rattan,
      whalebone and the like, which rod may 15) preferably be bent in
      its middle part so as to form two branches a,, a elastically
      combined with one another by means of an ear or its equivalent as
      shown in Figs. 1, 2 &amp; 5 or in any other suitable manner as
      shown in Figure 4 and including an acute or right angle, or the
      branches a, a may be made of two separate sticks, ends of which
      are pivoted on a stud g by means of a spring-tensioned ring h,
      Fig..8. Pivots j are provided at both ends of one of these
      branches a, a to enter eves of two bearings b, b directly to be
      held by the hands of a person or firmly united together by means
      of a suitable carrier to enable the branch to be turned within the
      bearings b. The other branch a is passed through a slotted guide c
      secured to the pivoted branch so as to be adapted to oscillate
      within this guide and adjustably carries a slide or spring d for
      lengthening or shortening this branch in case of necessity. To
      this slide or spring d a substance reacting on emanations radiated
      by the special treasure of the soil, to be searched for or by
      other substances to be tested or analysed, may detach ably and
      exchangeably be suspended, either directly or enclosed within a
      casing or capsule e, by means of hook and eye or in any other well
      known manner.<br>
      <br>
      The swinging branch a is provided with a scale j for reading. off
      the shifting of the slide or spring d on this b)ranch and the
      guide c with a scale i for fixing the arc of oscillation of the
      swinging branch a within this guide.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of making use of the apparatus in the position shown in
      Figs. 1 and 2 viz.: with the two branches a, a. diverging
      downward, the apparatus may also be used in a position opposite to
      that, that is to say, with the two branches diverging upward. In
      using the apparatus in this position, a more rapid rotation and
      hence a greater sensibility of the apparatus itself may be
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The mode of working of the apparatus 65 is as follows:With the
      object of searching for a certain treasure of the soil, a
      cartridge of a substance e, especially reacting on the emanations
      radiated by this treasure, 70 is attached to the oscillating
      branch a of the apparatus dither directly or enclosed within a
      capsule or casing.<br>
      <br>
      Now, if in the open country the apparatus with the reacting
      substance is -75 brought near to a resting place of the treasure
      of the soil searched for, the emanations radiated b.y this
      treasure first saturate the substance e and then produce a
      rotation of the pivoted 80 branch a of the apparatus in its
      bearings or seats b and, by means of an effect of physical nature,
      the oscillating branch a is at the same time oscillated, rotated,
      and attracted or repelled 85 till it comes to rest and, according
      to attraction or repulsion, points exactly in the direction in
      which the treasure of the soil sought for is resting or in a
      direction opposite to this. If the person carrying my apparatus,
      is just above the treasure of the soil the apparatus works in the
      manner of a regulator, that is to say, if, for instance, running
      lodes or stratifications of petroleum or 95 the like are present,
      it points in the general direction of strike and in so far as it
      is not in the direction of strike it faces the direction,of the
      flow.<br>
      <br>
      The position of the two branches a, a 100 relatively to one
      another, resulting from the different actions of attraction and
      repulsion, speed 'of oscillation and rotation, kind and quantity
      of the reacting substance e., length of the oscillating branch a
      and the like, which position may be read off in the scales i on
      guide c and j on oscillating branch a, permits a conclusion being
      drawn as to thickness, depth of resting and quality 110 of the
      treasure of the soil found on the basis of practical knowledge and
      calculation.<br>
      <br>
      For the better understanding of my invention I shall describe the
      same, by 115 way of example, in connection with finding sweet
      water. I use a capsule e, preferably in the form of a cartridge
      containing sweet water and attach the same by means of a hook and
      eye to the 120 free end,of the inclined oscillating branch a. of
      my apparatus. As to the exact forces causing the apparatus to work
      as described before, I do not Cj J 146,840 3 intend to make a
      definite statement though at the present state of development of
      the method it occurs to me that the water in the capsule e appears
      to be a gradually saturated with emanations radiated by the water
      in the ground.<br>
      <br>
      Then, a strong reaction takes place between the water in the
      capsule e and that in the ground, the emanations causing the
      oscillating branch a of my apparatus to move laterally and, if
      strong enough, imparting rotation to the whole apparatus around
      its axis.<br>
      <br>
      Any organic or mineral, or metallic substances in, as well as
      above, the ground answers my method if I use the same substance as
      that expected in the ground, as a reacting substance in the
      capsule e. The reacting substances to be used with my apparatus
      are generally of the same kind, or nature, as the treasures of the
      soil to lIe searched for or the substance to be tested or analysed
      themselves, that is to say, for indicating the presence of water,
      petroleum, coal, gold and the like, the most suitable reacting
      substances to be used are again water, petroleum, coal, gold and
      the like, but by numerous tests I have found that any other
      substances of chemical oI physical affinity to the substances to
      be searched for, tested or analysed, may also be used as reacting
      substances, as for instance, sulphur as a reacting substance for
      searching for, testing or analysing gold, a mixture of metallic
      copper, metallic nickel, metallic manganese, metallic mercury and
      tungsten steel as a reacting substance for searching for, testing
      or analysing sweet water and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In cases where a mineral or other substance of unknown character
      is supposed to be in the ground, I attach one reacting substance
      after another to the free end of the oscillating branch a of my
      apparatus until I find the one which is so near in its character,
      or nature, to the substance in the, ground that it causes the
      apparatus to work in the manner described. It occurs occasionally
      that a reacting substance does not work readily enough upon the
      apparatus because the composition of the reacting substance does
      not correspond to that of the substance in the ground.<br>
      <br>
      In this case the reacting substance is modified in its composition
      until one is found which causes the apparatus to rotate or swing
      in the most definite manner.<br>
      <br>
      For using my apparatus for testing or analysing substances of
      unknown character, I proceed in the same manner as described
      before, that is to say, I 65 attach reacting substances of
      different character, or nature, one after another to the free end
      of the oscillating branch a,of my apparatus, holding the apparatus
      above the substance to be tested, and I 70 proceed in this manner
      until I find the one reacting substance being so near in its
      character, or nature, to the substance to be tested or analysed,
      or to one of the constituents of this substance, that 75 it causes
      the apparatus to work in the manner previously described..<br>

      Addition to 146,840. Prospecting and water-finding. Divining-rod
      apparatus as described in the parent Specification is provided
      with a compass k for indicating the direction of a vein of mineral
      &amp;c. and with a speed-indicator m for indicating the number of
      oscillations of the rod. A pointer o on the rod co-operates with
      the compass. The compass and speed-indicator are connected by a
      rod l, and the whole may be supported on a post p by a ball-
      and-socket joint. The Specification as open to inspection under
      Sect. 91 (3) (a) describes also the application of a compass k and
      speed-indicator m to apparatus as shown in Fig. 5, wherein
      opposite ends of a coiled divining-rod a are supported in bearings
      in a circular or other frame l. This subject matter does not
      appear in the Specification as accepted.<br>
      <br>
      This invention has reference to apparatus used for indicating the
      presence of certain treasures of the soil, water, minerals or
      metals, petroleum (naphtha), coals or the like, and constitutes an
      improvement in or modification of the invention of my Application
      for Letters Patent No. 146,840 in which a stick or rod of wood,
      metal or other suitable material is bent or coiled up at its
      middle so as to form two branches elastically combined with one
      another and to which may detachably and exchangeably be attached a
      cartridge of a substance react- ing on the emanations radiated by
      the treasures of the soil searched for or by other substances to
      be tested or analysed.<br>
      <br>
      I am aware that in the British Specification No. 979 A.1). 1912, a
      device for locating the presence of water, minerals and the 'like,
      has been proposed in which in conjunction with a divining rod, an
      appliance is provided for recording the amount of attraction or
      pull upon the divining rod. But in this device the divining rod
      itself is of usual shape, that is to say, the two branches of the
      rod are rigidly, secured to one another and the rod is journaled
      in bearings in a frame or casing and the recording device is
      connected to the joint of the branches by means of a cord or the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      By this arrangement, the rod may only move in the manner of the
      usual divining rod, that is -to say, in a vertical direction and
      the recording device connected to the rod only gives an indication
      of the degree of attraction exerted by the water, minerals or the
      like on the rod itself and therefore of the depth at which the
      liquid or mineral sought is located in the ground.<br>
      <br>
      In opposition to this known device, in my apparatus I use
      cartridges of substances reacting to the emanations radiated by
      the treasures of the soil or by the substances to be tested or
      analysed detachably and exchangeably connected to the rod and the
      rod is rotateably inserted between a compass and a speed-indicator
      both adjustably fixed to a connecting bar so that the bar may
      easily' be put in or removed from the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      The object of this arrangement is to render it possible to read
      off directly the number of oscillations of the apparatus produced

      <br>
      Inventor(s): LAWRENCE JOHN VEALE<br>
      <br>
      A device for detecting water, metals and other materials comprises
      an L-shaped metal rod the limb 3 of which is rotateably supported
      in a tube 5. In use two of the devices are held one in each hand
      of the operator with the limbs 2 of each rod pointing forward, the
      limbs 2 converging on the presence of the material or objects to
      be detected. The tube is of copper and contains a sleeve 8 for
      reception of the limb 3 of the rod which is chromium plated. The
      sleeve is surrounded by floating copper discs 10 which divide the
      tube into compartments 12, 13, 14 respectively containing copper
      needles 15, springs 17 and metal filings 14. In a modification the
      limb 2 carries a wire having the form of a sine curve.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to an appliance for detecting the presence
      of water, metals and other materials.<br>
      <br>
      According to this invention the appliance comprises an L-shaped
      metal rod, the lower upright limb of which depends into a metal
      tube, the said depending portion being sup ported at the
      longitudinal axis of the tube in spaced relation from the tubular
      wall, and is capable of rotation about the said axis. Two of such
      appliances are held one in each hand of the prospector with the
      horizontal limb of each rod pointing forward. The presence of
      water or metals is indicated by a deviation of the horizontal limb
      from the forwardly pointing position.<br>
      <br>
      One form of the invention is illustrated in the accompanying
      drawing, wherein:<br>

      <br>
      Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, an L-shaped chromium-plated rod of one
      eighth inch diameter has a horizontal portion 2 two feet in length
      and a vertical portion 3 nine inches in length. If desired, the
      rod can be made in two parts for convenience of transport, the two
      parts being joined by a sleeve 4 into which the two parts are
      screw-threaded.<br>
      <br>
      The vertical portion 3 of the said rod is adapted to depend into a
      cylindrical copper tube 5 three quarters of an inch in diameter,
      nine inches inches, and closed at the lower end by means of a cap
      6 made of brass. There is also a top cap 7 which is bored to take
      an inner sleeve 8 which is five sixteenths of an inch in diameter
      and sealed at the base 9.<br>
      <br>
      The interior of the tube is divided into compartments by floating
      cooper discs 10 the outer edges of which just clear the inner
      surface of the tube 5. Each disc 10 has an aperture 11 in the
      centre to receive the sleeve 8 and vertical limb 3 of the rod. The
      discs 10 divide the tube into needle compartments 12, spring
      compartments 13 and dust compartments 14. Each needle compartment
      12 contains eight cooper needles 15 having a pin point at each end
      adapted to seat in dimples provided in the surface of the discs,
      the said dimples being arranged so that the needles 15 are spaced
      in a circle around the axis of the tube 5. The compartments 14 are
      filled with metal filings 16, for example, brass or cooper dust,
      and the spring compartments 13 each contain a light gauge coil
      spring 17 the purpose of which is to hold the needles 15 in
      position.<br>
      <br>
      In use, the vertical limb 3 of the rod is placed in he sleeve 8 in
      the tube 5 where it is just balanced to say in the position in
      which it is placed, but will rotate about a vertical axis on very
      slight movement. Two of such appliances are grasped one in each
      hand of the prospector about ten inches apart and the horizontal
      portions 2 of the rod are made to point forward. As the prospector
      moves over metal, water or other material or objects to be
      detected, the rods converge.<br>
      <br>
      In order to make the appliance more sensitive the rod 2 may be
      provided with a wire 21, see Fig. 4, which serpentines in and cut
      through apertures 20 in the rod. Twenty-four loops are provided in
      all alternating above and below the rod 2. The distance between
      the crest of each loop and the rod is three quarters of an inch.<br>
      <br>
      Other material or objects that can be detected by the use of the
      appliance are: water mains (iron or asbestos), concrete pipes,
      sewers F use or disused), stone drains, elec- tric cables
      underground, concrete o; wood floors) and reinforcing irons in
      concrete and many other substances.<br>
      <br>
      The dimensions given above are by way of example only and can be
      varied to suit individual requirements.<br>

      Inventor(s): QUEHEN RENE<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a novel type of detection
      apparatus of the divining rod type. The apparatus according to the
      invention is characterised in that it consists of two metal rods
      1, each of them being intended to be held in the hand of the user
      and in that each rod is bent and that the part 2 is capable of
      rotation around the part 3. <br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a new kind of divining rod type
      detection device.<br>
      <br>
      Known devices of this kind consist of a fork-shaped metal or wood
      which are especially moves to indicate the position of the water.<br>
      <br>
      It was proposed several explanations for this phenomenon
      recognized but unsolved (Research YVES POLAR D No. 124, July
      August 1981)<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is not intended to provide an answer to the

      The apparatus of the invention comprises two rods 1 each of which
      is intended to be held in one hand of the user.<br>
      <br>
      Each strip is metal and is bent preferably at right angles by
      determining a portion 2 intended to be held in the hand of the
      user and a dwarf orthogonal part 3 to previous to be held
      horizontally or in a substantially horizontal position.<br>

        <b>Divining rod with inset pearl - has central spiral and two
          branches which are joined to form setting for precious stone</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): KIRCHNER WILHELM<br>
      <br>
      The divining rod has two branches (1, 2) with handles at their
      extremities, which are connected to a central spiral (11). The
      part of the spiral which is furthest from the handles has a
      setting (15) for a pearl (16) or any semi-precious, or precious
      stone. The rod is made from two identical pieces whose extremities
      are joined by soldering or braising. They are joined at two places
      (12, 13) so that the part between them (14) is curved outwards to
      form part of the setting for the stone.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a divining rod comprising legs
      which extend from a middle spiral and each of which is provided
      with a handle at its free end.<br>
      <br>
      We already know a divining rod of this type.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, this known strip is improved in that
      it comprises on the spiral, in particular on the CBte of this
      spiral is farthest handles, a housing or holding device for
      holding preferably a bead, a semi-precious stone, a precious
      stone, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="fr2446081a.jpg" height="586"
          width="219"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This housing or holding device for receiving the bead, or other
      member, is preferably designed as a cage, a frame, a ring, etc.<br>
      <br>
      These shapes are particularly advantageous because they enable to
      use the same material as for the branches or the like.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, they make it possible to realize the housing or
      retainer at least partly in one piece with the spiral.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, in a form of such a divining-rod which is especially
      preferred, it is proposed that the strip is composed of two
      identical parts which the former ends are joined by welding or
      brazing, these ends forming together at least one portion of the
      housing or retainer.<br>
      <br>
      According to another feature of the invention, the ends of parts
      of the rod which are opposite the handle are welded to one
      another, or assembled in a similar way CON at two points spaced
      apart by a certain interval and the portion between these two
      points is curved outwardly according to the form of a ring, to
      form at least a portion of the housing or the bead retainer
      device, or other element.<br>
      <br>
      In this embodiment, the expenditure is particularly low.<br>
      <br>
      It is sufficient to slightly extend the rod tip and achieve a
      second assembly of the two halves of the stick, in particular by
      welding or soldering or by an equivalent assembly mode.<br>
      <br>
      Another development of the invention is characterized by a bead,
      or the like, located inside the ring, which is traversed by a
      filamentary fixation member whose ends are connected to the wand.<br>
      <br>
      It is particularly advantageous that both ends of the bead
      fastener, or other element, are attached to two points of welding,
      in particular by welding, brazing or equivalent means
      simultaneously with achieving two sources. The condition to be
      fulfilled is of course that the material on which the bead, or
      other element is inserted is constituted by a material suitable
      for welding, soldering or another similar assembly method.<br>
      <br>
      Other features and advantages of the invention mparattront during
      the following description.<br>
      <br>
      The accompanying drawing shows the divining rod of the invention
      in plan view and partly in longitudinal section.<br>
      <br>
      The divining rod according to the invention is preferably composed
      of two parts 1 and 2 of the same length and the same configuration
      and the handles 3 and 4 respectively mounted on these parts
      rotatably.<br>
      <br>
      The handles are adopted in axial translation with two flanges 5
      and 6 on the ends Oete inontÃ©es handle-baguette, which are offset
      with respect to one another in the longitudinal direction and
      fixed for example by welding.<br>
      <br>
      The handles 3 and 4 are tubular.<br>
      <br>
      Between each handle 3 or 4 and the end 7 of the rod on which it is
      mounted, is a metal intermediate tube 8.<br>
      <br>
      This tube may be made in the same way that the handles 3 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      Its length can be the same or different handles.<br>
      <br>
      The intermediate tube encloses the end 7 with a clearance which
      corresponds optimally to the needs, particularly as regards the
      material used for the baguette0 Similarly, one can also provide a
      game, not shown in the drawing, between each intermediate tube and
      the handle which surrounds the tube.<br>
      <br>
      It failed to represent this game for graphics technical reasons.<br>
      <br>
      At its end which forms the middle of the wand, each part of this
      rod is bent to form a loop of about one turn and the free end 9 or
      10 which protrudes beyond this loop protruding from the loop to
      the outside in a radial direction.<br>
      <br>
      Both ends 9 and 10 of parts 1 and 2 are assembled together, for
      example by welding.<br>
      <br>
      It forms a kind of needle used, for example to a healer or doctor,
      to designate with great precision points or regions of the body of
      a patient or an animal.<br>
      <br>
      The spiral 11 obtained in this embodiment and which comprises
      approximately two turns protects the assembly 12 in the shape of
      rod the divining-rod according to the invention against mechanical
      damage and tearing.<br>
      <br>
      At a certain distance from the first assembly 12, is a second
      assembly 13 connecting the ext re- mites parts 1 and 2 of the
      strip which are furthest from the handle.<br>
      <br>
      The two assemblies are preferably of the same constitution, that
      is to say that in both cases, they may be performed for example by
      welding or brazing.<br>
      <br>
      To form a housing or retainer 15 to a bead 16, a semi-precious
      stone, a precious stone or the like, the portion 14 located
      between the two assemblies 12 and 13 is bent outward in a ring
      shape , that is to say, on each half of this part is formed at
      least approximately a half-ring.<br>
      <br>
      To form a cage, one could also define a second ring, for example
      composed of two similar half-rings, which extend in a plane
      perpendicular to that of the first ring.<br>
      I1 is also possible and provided in the exemplary embodiment
      shown, use of the ring only as housing for the bead, or other
      element, and retain this bead or similar part by means of a
      filamentary fixation member 17 The ends of this element may be
      fixed by welding or soldering simultaneously with the welding of
      the joining points 12 and 13, which eliminates an extra work
      phase.<br>
      <br>
      For the various chopsticks, you can choose different combinations
      of materials for the handle and stone, or other materials.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in the embodiment in question, it is planned to manufacture
      the outer sleeves handles money and use this metal in combination
      with a moonstone.<br>

      The apparatus 1 (Fig. 1) essentially comprises a divining 20 with
      a sensor, a GPS receiver 30 with a coupler, and a computer 40
      having a screen 41, a memory and a downstream printer 42 for
      creating a printed protocol 43.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the divining 20 consisting
      essentially formed by a wire 21, preferably in the form of a steel
      wire or copper.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the free ends of the divining rod 20 is rotatably
      connected to a torsion bar 22, 23, which in turn is rotatably
      mounted in a handle 24, 25th<br>
      <br>
      The free end of each handle 24, 25 expands to seat 26, 27 for
      fixed mounting a spoke 28, 29th<br>
      <br>
      On each spoke 28, 29 is in each case a strain gauge 51, 52nd<br>
      <br>
      At the strain gauge lines 53, 54 are electrically connected.<br>
      <br>
      The lines 53, 54 are preferably brought together at the GPS
      receiver 30.<br>
      <br>
      The latter is connected via a line 31 to a computer 40, a monitor
      41 and a (not shown in the drawings) memory and, if necessary, a
      printer 42 of a Protocol 43 in the form of a graphic and / or in
      the form of text or Includes numbers.<br>
      <br>
      The GPS receiver 30 (Global Positioning System) is used for the
      ground radio navigation for determining the coordinates of the
      position where the GPS receiver 30 and thus for dowsing qualified
      person is currently using the divining 20th<br>
      <br>
      The equivalent circuit diagram (Fig. 2) of the strain gauges 51,
      52 shows a bridge circuit consisting of resistors 55 for tensile
      and compressive stress resistors 56 for the strain gauges 51, 52.<br>
      <br>
      At terminals 57 a supply voltage is applied.<br>
      <br>
      The desired measuring signal is taken via terminals 58th<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, resistors of 5 OMEGA were
      used.<br>
      <br>
      The strain gauges are from the Company Measurements Group and have
      the designation TK-06-5082R-350th<br>
      <br>
      The voltage applied to the terminals 57 supply voltage is 5 volts
      AC.<br>
      <br>
      Measurement methods<br>
      <br>
      Measurement with the aid of a GPS receiver to determine the
      current coordinates<br>
      <br>
      The measurement of a distance and an area is made possible with
      the help of the GPS receiver 30, which is used to determine the
      current coordinates of the position of the dowsing qualified
      person holding the divining rod 20 in hands.<br>
      <br>
      If the dowsing rod 20 (Fig. 1) held by the dowsing competent
      person at the handles 24, 25, the wire 21 of the divining rod 20
      is rotationally pulled down.<br>
      <br>
      This deflection of the wire 21 is so strong that twist the free
      ends of the wire 21 with the mind-rotatably mounted torsion bars
      22, 23 with respect to the handles 24, 25th<br>
      <br>
      By twisting the torsion bars 22, 23 with respect to the handles
      24, 25 are the bent with their ends in the receptacles 26, 27
      firmly clamped spokes 28, 29 and the strain gauges 51, 52 acted
      upon accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      The at terminals 58 (Fig. 2) of the strain gauges 51, 52 emerging
      signals are via lines 53, 54 (Fig. 1), the GPS receiver 30 and the
      line 31 sent to the computer 40 for storage and evaluation.<br>
      <br>
      Moves to the dowsing competent person along a given route, so that
      along this stretch changing intensity of earth radiation causes
      different strong deflections of divining 20th<br>
      <br>
      Wearing the person also the GPS receiver 30 with it, so there will
      be a recording of the changing intensity of earth radiation along
      the route in Computer 40th<br>
      <br>
      Next to each other measured in this way several routes, we obtain
      a two-dimensional gauging.<br>
      <br>
      Directs an insulating body 60 (Fig. 3) Earth Radiation from, it is
      found that the field lines converge again above the insulating
      60th<br>
      <br>
      Even the history of earth radiation in the height above the ground
      with the described apparatus 1 in a manner analogous ausmessbar if
      one ensures that the amount of the respective measuring position
      is detected and each measured value is assigned.<br>
      <br>
      Measurement with the aid of an electromechanical device for
      determining the current coordinates<br>
      <br>
      The measurement of a distance and an area is also possible by
      means of a mechanical or electro-mechanical means for determining
      the current coordinates, which will be explained with reference to
      FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, would be with a coupler on this map used in the
      device instead of the GPS receiver 30 shown in FIG. 1, only one
      coupler, which are used for merging of the lines 53, 54, and from
      which the computer 40 leading line 31 would depart.<br>
      <br>
      At the dowsing qualified person 70 (Fig. 4), the ends of cords 71,
      72 are hooked, whose other ends are each wound on a per se known
      drum 73, 74.<br>
      <br>
      The cords 71, 72 for measuring the distances, which currently
      complies with the dowsing authorized person 70 to the respective
      drum 73, 74, always by means of suitable, known per se means, such
      as friction clutch or precise electromechanical control of the
      drums 73, 74 held taut.<br>
      <br>
      The drums 73, 74 or the distance measurement serving lines 71, 72
      are known per se encoders 75, 76 in a conventional manner in such
      a way in the functional connection that on which the for dowsing
      competent person 70 is currently in any place, , is well known how
      far away she is present from the respective drum 73, 74th<br>
      <br>
      The encoders 75, 76 (Fig. 4) Report the determined values â€‹â€‹of
      them over (in the drawings not shown) leads to the computer 40
      (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      To determine the absolute point at which the for dowsing competent
      person 70 is, evaluates one of the unwound lengths of the cords
      71, 72 alpha means the values â€‹â€‹and angle supplied by the encoders
      75, 76 and beta (Fig. 4) 72 which form the lines 71, at a
      predetermined distance 77 between the drums 73, 74th<br>
      <br>
      Enter these values â€‹â€‹into the computer 40 (FIG. 1), this
      calculates the current coordinates at which the for dowsing
      competent person 70 is straight, it represents on the screen 41,
      records them and printed as desired, a graphic and / or Text or
      Figures from.<br>
      <br>
      It's even easier to store the length of the distance 77 between
      the drums 73, 74 in the computer 40 (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      The computer 40 can then run the routes, which result from the
      unwound from the drums 73, 74 cords 71, 72, the coordinates of the
      location are calculated, at which the qualified person for dowsing
      70 is currently located.<br>

        <b>Divining-rod for detecting geobiological stimuli</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;KEDING CARL ROBERT<br>
      <br>
      The divining-rod has an electrically conductive fork with a pair
      of relatively spaced fork arms (3, 4), which are insulated at one
      end. The fork arms are contacted by respective electrical
      conductors (5, 6), lying at a distance from one another. Pref. the
      electrical conductors are provided by rods or plates which lie
      parallel to one another and which can slide axially relative to
      the fork arms. The latter may be coupled to a voltage source, with
      the electrical conductors coupled together via non-conductive
      coupling elements (7, 8).<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a divining rod with an electrically
      conductive fork.<br>
      <br>
      Dowsing can be used for detecting geobiological stimuli.<br>
      <br>
      Here it is important to implement, for example from the ground
      emerging vibrations so that This results in a rash of Rute.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, the dowsing themselves have a certain resonance
      function, so that their design is crucial for stimulus detection.<br>
      <br>
      According to DE-A1 30 20 636 has been proposed to make the tip of
      the tail variable to react with adjustable size in different
      radiation can.<br>
      <br>
      An extended antenna function of divining is in Page 154 described
      <br>
      <br>
      With the Lecher line-rod shown there, it is possible to detect the
      radiation in the microwave range selectively.<br>
      <br>
      Often give the known rods but only inadequate signals, so that it
      is the object of the present invention to provide a more dowsing
      which allows an even better stimulus detection.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention the solution of the problem according
      to the characterizing features of claim 1.<br>
      <br>
      According to a particular embodiment of the invention, the
      electrical conductor rod or be plate-shaped, which can achieve a
      substantially parallel arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, the electrical
      conductors are arranged axially on the fork parts.<br>
      <br>
      This makes it possible that the divining rod resonates with
      certain vibrations, so that different stimuli can be selected.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, it is advantageous if the electrical conductors surround
      the uncontacted fork part without contact.<br>
      <br>
      This allows the electrical conductor arranged in alignment,
      without causing an obstruction by the fork parts.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment of the invention, the fork parts
      can also be connected to a voltage source, whereby a better
      stimulus recording is made possible.<br>
      <br>
      To stabilize the rod it has proven effective to fix the fork parts
      by non-conductive connecting elements.<br>
      <br>
      According to a preferred embodiment of the invention may be
      connected, so that there is also for this a solid support with
      these fasteners turn the electrical conductors.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in the
      drawings and will be described in more detail below.<br>

      FIG. 1 shows a preferred embodiment of the invention in divining a
      schematic plan view.<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the fork on 2 different fork parts.<br>
      <br>
      The fork members 3, 4 are arranged at a distance from one another
      and extend substantially parallel to each other.<br>
      <br>
      They consist of an electrically conductive material, for example
      made of metal or carbon fibers, and are preferably rod-shaped.<br>
      <br>
      Their cross-section may be round or square.<br>
      <br>
      The Fork parts 3, 4 are insulated ends 9, 10th<br>
      <br>
      At the opposite ends of this 11, 12 are the fork parts 3, 4
      connected to handles 13, 14th<br>
      <br>
      Typically for dowsing, the handgrips 13, 14 at an angle to the
      fork parts 3, 4 are arranged.<br>
      <br>
      The handles 13, 14 may, like the fork parts 3, 4 made of a
      conductive material so that extend the fork parts 3, 4 as handles
      13, 14 in the simple case.<br>
      <br>
      When properly used, the dowsing can after receiving stimuli
      between the handles 13, 14 a tension arise, which can change the
      polarity according to individual circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      According to a particular embodiment of the invention, it is also
      possible to connect the handles 13, 14 to a voltage source, in
      particular a direct-current source.<br>
      <br>
      As a DC power source, for example, used a commercially available
      battery.<br>
      <br>
      With a suitable design of the handles 13, 14, such a battery also
      be accommodated in the handles 13, 14, wherein a conductive
      connection between the ends 15, 16 is provided.<br>
      <br>
      Applying a voltage has the advantage that, 6, an electric field is
      formed between the fork parts 3, 4 and the electrical conductors
      5, whereby the male stimuli are better detected.<br>
      <br>
      To fix the fork 2 can still be a holder 17 provided that, if the
      fork parts 3, 4 and the handles 13, 14 is not surrounded by an
      insulating layer of a nonconductive material such as Plexiglas
      exists.<br>
      <br>
      The section magnification shown in FIG. 2 shows the specific
      characteristics of dowsing invention.<br>
      <br>
      After this, the fork parts 3, 4 forming isolated, wherein the fork
      member 3 with an electrical conductor 5 and the fork part is 4
      contacted with an electrical conductor. 6<br>
      <br>
      The in spaced conductors 5, 6 are preferably rod-shaped or
      plate-shaped.<br>
      <br>
      They can as well as the fork pieces 3, 4 are made of metal or
      other electrically conductive materials.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred manner, the electrical conductors 5, 6 with
      non-conductive connecting elements 7, 8 may be connected.<br>
      <br>
      The connecting elements 7, 8 provide here is a position fixing the
      electrical conductors 5, 6 and are glued or screwed with this
      example.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly simple mounting of the connecting elements 7, 8 can
      be z.<br>
      <br>

      fork members 3, 4 having adapted holes 18-21, through which the
      fork members 3, 4 are performed.<br>
      <br>
      In order to form an electric field, the electrical conductors 5, 6
      are each connected to only one fork part 3 4.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, it has proven advantageous if the non-contacted
      fork part 3, 4 is surrounded without contact of the respective
      electrical conductor 5,. 6<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 3, the electrical conductor 5 for example, have
      an enlarged bore 22, whose diameter is greater than the diameter
      of the cradle member 4.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, it is possible to provide, instead of the bore
      22, a differently shaped recess 23, in which the fork part 3 may
      be placed without contact to the electrical conductors 6 (Fig. 4).<br>
      <br>
      The divining invention has the advantage that changes the distance
      of the electrical conductors 5, vary. 6<br>
      <br>
      The electrical conductors 5, 6 are arranged axially on the fork
      parts 3, 4 and can be fixed in any position z.<br>
      <br>
      For example, by a locking screw 24th<br>
      <br>
      By moving the electrical conductors 5, 6, the electric field can
      be changed, which is formed between the electrical conductors 5,
      6, so that a selection of the male stimuli can take place.<br>

      Inventor(s): KRAMER FRITZ DR MED<br>
      <br>
      The test instrument has a handle (12) and a vibration head (16)
      which is attached to the handle via a spring rod (14) and which
      can be set vibrating wrt. the handle. The free vibration length of
      the rod between the handle and the vibration head is adjustable
      and can be determined using a scale (46) on the instrument. The
      scale can be applied to the handle and the spring rod can carry a
      pointer (50) associated with the scale. The hollow handle has a
      guide element (30) and a fixing element (40). The spring rod
      extends into the hollow handle and can be moved by the guide
      element. The fixing element can fix the rod with a set length
      protruding .<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a test instrument with a handle and a
      displaceable at this securable via a spring bar, vibrate against
      the handle pivoting head.<br>
      <br>
      Such a test instrument is disclosed in DE 42 06 017 C1 of the
      applicant.<br>
      <br>
      In this known test instrument Schwingkopf on the spring bar to the
      grip is so connected that there is a clearly identifiable spring
      free length, which means that the oscillation behavior of the
      oscillating head is precisely defined.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, such a test instrument has precisely one resonance
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is based is to provide a test instrument of the
      aforementioned type that is optimally suited for different
      applications like looking for specific drugs, the search for
      water, searching geophatischer distortions etc. the task.<br>
      <br>
      This object is inventively in a test instrument of the
      aforementioned type by that the free vibration length of the
      spring rod between the handle and the oscillating head is
      adjustable.<br>
      <br>
      This adjustability of the free vibration length of the spring rod,
      it is possible, as required to accurately adjust the inventive
      test instrument to the respective application, in order for
      example after making the appropriate setting of the free spring
      rod length. Specific medication for a patient such as Heart means
      to be able to very precisely determine the appropriate reaction of
      the test instrument.<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, the inventive test instrument suitable eg. For water
      search, search geophatischer distortions, to search electrical
      fields eg. Of underfloor heating systems, for the diagnosis of
      various human organs, ie which drugs for the corresponding organs
      are optimally finding.<br>
      <br>
      So the spring free length of the spring rod is eg. Set to 13.5 cm
      when the inventive test instrument is applied to the water search,
      and it is the spring free length of the spring rod for example.
      Set to 28.7 cm when geophatische with the inventive test
      instrument faults be sought.<br>
      <br>
      The figures latter provide naturally only represent examples,
      because it is understood that the respective adjustment of the
      free spring length of the spring rod between the oscillating head
      and the handle dependent both on the choice of materials for the
      spring bar as well as its cross-sectional dimensions or by the
      respective user of the test instrument are.<br>
      <br>
      To provide anytime reproducible conditions in the inventive test
      instrument, it is advantageous if the test instrument is
      configured with a suitable scale, ie when the set free vibration
      length of the spring rod between the handle and the pivoting head
      can be detected by means of a provided on the test instrument
      scale.<br>
      <br>
      This scale can On spring bar itself be provided in order to
      determine the respective free vibration length of the spring rod
      can.<br>
      <br>
      After the spring bar itself, however, conveniently consists of a
      spring wire and, consequently, has only a small cross-sectional
      dimensions and thus a small surface area, so that the attachment
      of an appropriate scale may be difficult, it is advantageous if in
      the inventive test instrument, the scale is provided on the handle
      and when the spring bar is provided with a scale associated
      display element.<br>
      <br>
      Said scale may be formed with a millimeter scale like a ruler
      mark, with a tariff classification or any other subdivision of the
      tick marks.<br>
      <br>
      A simple design of the inventive test instrument is achieved when
      the handle is provided hollow and with a guide element and a
      fixing element when out verstellbeweglich with his from
      Schwingkopf remote first end through the guide element
      hineinerstreckt the spring bar into the hollow handle, and when
      the fixing to fixing a certain length of the handle is provided
      from the protruding portion of the spring rod.<br>
      <br>
      With such a design of the test instrument, the handle may comprise
      a sleeve, which is provided at one, the oscillating head facing
      end with a closing piece which is formed with a guide member
      forming the guide rod through hole.<br>
      <br>
      In the through hole, it usually is a through hole whose diameter
      is adapted to the diameter of the spring bar is usually formed
      from a spring wire.<br>
      <br>
      A simple configuration, in a test instrument of the latter type is
      achieved when the sleeve and the closure piece are provided with a
      transverse bore which is formed with an internal thread, and when
      in the internally threaded transverse bore a fixing element
      forming for the spring rod screw is screwed ,<br>
      <br>
      So even after a long term use of the test instrument suffers his
      respectability in any way, it is advantageous if the sleeve with
      the closure piece having an appropriate surface coating.<br>
      <br>
      This surface coating can be a gold plating.<br>
      <br>
      With an appropriate surface coating also forming the fixing screw
      and the set at the spring rod oscillating head is expediently
      provided.<br>
      <br>
      A well and precisely in its free spring length adjustable spring
      rod, ie a precisely adjustable test instrument is feasible, if the
      handle is formed with a longitudinal slot, where the scale is
      provided, and when the display member on the first end portion in
      standing in the grip of the spring bar is arranged.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the indicating element preferably has a circumferential
      contour which is adapted to the clear inside contour of the hollow
      grip piece.<br>
      In this way, in fact achieves that the spring bar mentioned not
      only by the above, provided on frame guide member is guided in a
      linearly movable, but also by the display element itself inside
      the hollow pistol grip.<br>
      <br>
      There arise therefore two spaced apart guides of the spring bar,
      which means that the spring bar can be adjusted easily very
      precise after a corresponding unlocking of the fixing.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the fixing member is then operated again to fix the
      spring rod and maintain the set spring free length of the spring
      rod.<br>
      <br>
      Is the spring free length of the spring rod is relatively short,
      so a vibration of the vibrating head with a relatively high
      frequency results in less vibration amplitude; is the spring free
      length of the spring rod large, it follows conversely a relatively
      low oscillation frequency at the same time relatively large
      vibration amplitude.<br>
      <br>
      The display member may comprise a plate and an upstanding from the
      plate having fixing portion, wherein the plate has adapted to the
      inner contour of the hollow handle, the circumferential contour of
      the piece and the first end portion of the spring rod is fixed to
      the fixing portion.<br>
      <br>
      Thus with a test instrument thus designed an accurate indication
      of each set free spring length of the spring rod is possible, the
      plates can be formed with a knife-like tapered peripheral contour.<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of the inventive test instrument is clipped in the
      drawing marked in a sectional view and is described below.<br>

      or the medium in the reception or transmission chamber. The
      separate conductors of the resonant circuit have no fixed
      galvanically conducting mutual connections over theier entire
      lengths. The, pref, elastic, handles (45.1,45.2) are assigned to
      the carrier (21.2) or a slide (30) and can have markings (38).
      USE/ADVANTAGE - Can be used for long and very long wavelengths and

      interference and / or to the field affected by absorption,
      emission, interference and / or resonance deployable, tunable
      antenna having at least one abstrahlfÃ¤higen receive and resonant

      <br>
      <br>
      Conductor spacing and / or distance to the vehicle and the ambient
      conditions of the resonant circuit are chosen such that in the
      resonant circuit, there is a characteristic impedance that matches
      the impedance of free space or the medium in the reception or

      <br>
      Dowsing with the above features have long been used.<br>

      In DE-OS 36 42 436 A1 is treated, how to make the bandwidth for
      the use of such technical antennas or divining by appropriate
      guidance and design of extending spaced conductors.<br>
      <br>
      Here are to be received which, abzusendenden or indeed
      considerably enlarged to search wavelengths through the outer
      structure of Lecherleitungsgestaltung, however, is limited
      depending on the choice of greetings, and structuring of materials
      on 5 mm to 5 m wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      In nature in biophysical processes in geomancy, the science of
      localized, acting mainly on the human vibration operations, and in
      the art, however, come within the range of the radio window also
      much larger wavelengths up in the longest long-wave range.<br>
      <br>
      For biophysical studies, as well as technical and scientific
      studies, especially ancient places of worship and to lessons
      learned from them facilities are functional, which make it
      possible, with the simplest means to cover a very wide range of
      wavelengths, to the importance of each factor of a vibration event
      in a space be able to analyze.<br>
      <br>
      For this is because of the great sensitivity and the large
      bandwidth of the biological system human divining the particular

      V-shaped divining rods are particularly suitable by its handling
      after the handle length and technology in the tuning technique of
      the applicant in order to quickly adapt to different phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      The previous V-shaped divining rods were not equipped with
      adequate structures to receive long waves.<br>
      <br>
      They were previously only suitable for the reception of
      wavelengths between a few cm and a few dm, up to a maximum in the
      range of wavelengths with some m.<br>
      <br>
      The two V-shaped divining rods that are fixed at its upper end and
      in each case to be searched phenomenon well further conductively
      connected.<br>
      <br>
      The previously known, used as an antenna for receiving and
      transmitting structures with conductor tracks according to the
      Lecherprinzip had always at any point an electrically conductive
      cross-connection, as is shown in particular also in the DE-OS 36
      42 436 A1.<br>
      <br>
      This spatially unchangeable cross-connection means that when
      placing a slide - no matter whether it is inductive or capacitive
      nature and / or additional components or not - the distance
      between the field comparatively authoritative reference point and
      the stationary, conducting cross-connection in the resonance
      behavior of the overall system enters in some way, if not this
      essentially determined.<br>
      <br>
      Thereby, the wavelength range for reception and transmission is
      forcibly dependent on the geometric dimensions of some kind.<br>
      <br>
      This dependence limits the use possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has for its object to provide an antenna for
      technical and scientific purposes, for the influences of field
      events and / or as a divining rod by suitable design to equip so
      that they especially for the region of greater and greatest
      wavelengths, but possibly also to in the sub-millimeter range can
      be used, which are to be interpreted according to the criteria
      known from the antenna Physics and High Frequency Physics, and
      which is possibly used also for determining and / or modifying
      various portions of the field events.<br>

      Use of an open Lecher line on a suitable support means that you
      can thereby determine free or at least free the received or
      radiated wavelength in a much larger area that the additionally
      attached devices, such as slides other with capacitive or
      inductive elements or own resonating circuits, Auxiliary equipment
      and possibly the attached handles can be influenced by the
      behavior with respect to wavelength, without being tied to the
      possibilities provided by the cross-connection conditions.<br>

      impedance components a tunable resonant circuit forms, in its
      resonant wavelength enters the length between the respective
      tapping point and the field comparatively authoritative reference
      point.<br>
      <br>
      Expressed divided, the divining the following characteristics:<br>
      <br>
      - It is designed according to the laws of physics and antenna is
      used afterwards;<br>
      <br>
      - She has two bars which are being handled by the user's hands;<br>
      <br>
      - The bars are the biasing forces receptive connected at their
      ends close to each other;<br>
      <br>
      - The rods are held with different lengths, free, the length of
      handle forming antenna lengths (distances) of the interconnected
      ends,<br>
      marked by following features:<br>
      <br>
      - The holder of the ends of the rods is respectively to seekers,
      to be received or to be sent electrical, magnetic and / or
      mechanical (ponderomotive) phenomenon formed virtually unaffected
      continue conducting;<br>
      <br>
      - In the region of the holder is provided with an arrangement of
      components which form a resonant circuit which is tuned to the
      desired impedance and the resonance under consideration.<br>
      <br>
      This part of the invention is based on the realization that,
      although a mechanical support for the rods is necessary to absorb
      the forces to be applied, that this support but not necessarily
      also needs very specific properties for the electrical, magnetic
      and / or ponderomotive phenomena exhibit, but that they are
      designed appropriately so that it has no significant impact on the
      work result with regard to these phenomena, but that one rather
      apart from the mechanical support an arrangement with suitable
      components providing that both the resonance with respect to the
      eligible wavelength and the characteristic impedance the overall
      arrangement allows to determine the appropriate design as an
      antenna and / or divining.<br>
      <br>
      Now that the mechanical function of the support is separated from
      the actual physical function of the holding portion, can be
      provided at this location suitable aids to quickly adjust the
      overall arrangement of the respective wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      The well-known from the high- and low-frequency technology and
      communications technology and wireless transmission technology
      structural elements and components can now sense selected and the
      mechanical mounting of the ends assigned by V-shaped divining
      rods, thus resulting in an overall system of a divining rod, which
      extends through the wavelengths defining components with an
      extremely large bandwidth allows an unexpectedly simple means and
      adapt very quickly.<br>
      <br>
      These can be used alone or in conjunction with one another on the
      one hand, the known from the dimensioned as Lecher divining
      structural elements, on the other, which are known from the design
      of resonant circuits with capacitors and inductors and devices
      known from the cavity and -leitertechnik facilities.<br>
      <br>
      An important design feature for the opportunity to substantially
      increase the resonance wavelength of the entire system, is the
      provision of an open-ended Lecher both ends of parallel or
      divergent or convergent ladders.<br>
      <br>
      The spaced conductors over their entire length without a fixed
      ohmic contact with each other are performed.<br>
      <br>
      This is then assigned to a cross-connection which can be
      configured as electrically conductive connection, as a capacitive
      or an inductive or a compound semiconductor.<br>
      <br>
      By selecting the dimensions and materials determines the built-up
      with this conductor system resonant circuit in conjunction with
      the free grip length of the rods, the effective antenna length.<br>
      <br>
      In a design independently selected from the training, assembly and
      the use of the bars can open to either side Lecher also in
      connection with arranged at angles of the order of 90 Â°, used
      short handles for various purposes in conjunction with other
      configurations and components become.<br>
      <br>
      It determines in particular the configuration of the Lecher line
      and the design of the intended on their slides and / or on the
      support arrangement, the resonance wavelength and the
      characteristic impedance.<br>
      <br>
      Through appropriate training on the slider, for example, with an
      adjustable small cavity, you can use the same antenna arrangement
      for briefest mm-wavelengths, for example, by designing a mixed
      addition of the associated element.<br>
      <br>
      One can by changing the arrangement of the handles in one of the
      V-shaped divining appropriate configuration then without much
      further aids to the alternate receipt or sending or searching of
      briefest and allerlÃ¤ngsten wavelengths pass.<br>
      <br>
      It has been recognized that the angle between the respective
      conductor track the Lecher line and the handle-like rod of
      material influence on the resonance wavelength of the whole system
      is.<br>
      <br>
      If the angle of the order of 90 Â°, so the free length is between
      the hand and the connection of the rod to the track of
      Lechersystems only smaller active component in the resonant
      wavelength of the entire system a.<br>
      <br>
      If the angle between the conductor and rod connection below about
      80 Â°, so the free length is between the hand and the connection of
      the rod to the conductor as an independent, free antenna length in
      the overall system and, in conjunction with the design of the
      arrangement in the region the holder for a substantial part of the
      resonant wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      It should be stated that because of the openness of Lechersystems
      the handles are equal to the angles at which they completely
      connected, enter into the determination of the resonance
      wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      The approximately at right angles connected handles can not handle
      with distance and hence greater length of handle you.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, it is conveniently on the V-shaped arrangement of the
      handles on the carrier or slide.<br>
      The handles or formed as auxiliary antennas rods can be formed on
      a variety of known types, in particular as an elastic dielectric
      antenna rods of plastic.<br>
      <br>
      In a particularly advantageous development of the invention it can
      be provided that the plastic bars are fastened to optionally
      adjustable angle brackets.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it can be provided in a particularly advantageous
      manner in that the bars are made of materials with semiconductor
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the rods can be designed as telescopic rods.<br>
      <br>
      The rods are preferably about 0.2 to 1 m long and about 2 to 8 mm
      thick.<br>
      <br>
      Setting and reading can significantly improve and simplify, when
      the bars with embossed and / or printed scales and / or markings
      are provided.<br>
      <br>
      Particularly favorable usage and setting conditions arise if the
      holders for the rods approximately in the middle of the total
      length of the guided spaced conductors are arranged.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly important aspect of the invention provides that,
      for a antenna according to the embodiment described here, but also
      by known Lecher Prinzip- embodiments in which the conductors is
      associated with resistive, inductive and / or capacitive coupling

      cooperating with the conductors through resistive compounds or are
      coupled to these inductively and / or capacitively.<br>
      <br>
      Then you can easily replace the carrier with conductor paths to
      the same to use different properties for the overall system and
      can also be on one side or the other or both sides of the slide
      with the handles put one or more further slide same or different
      configuration and thereby the diversity the deployment and usage
      options significantly increase.<br>
      <br>

      that, for a antenna according to the herein described embodiment,
      but also by known Lecher Principle embodiments, the conductors at
      least a slider is associated with which at least an adjustable
      capacitor and / or at least an adjustable inductance are included.<br>
      <br>
      It can be advantageously provided that the slider is equipped with
      a switch that either the galvanic connection, the capacitive and /
      or inductive connection of the conductors on and off permitted.<br>
      <br>
      Another important aspect of the invention provides that on the
      back of the wearer's another Lecherleitungsform, for example, a
      converging / diverging arrangement and / or an arrangement with
      fixed cross-connection at the end or formed somewhere between the
      ends.<br>
      <br>
      With such a device, you can, if necessary, in conjunction with the
      work in the rest of this application and / or by reacting shifters
      with additional facilities in accordance with the principles of
      the various Lecherantennen types simultaneously or in rapid
      succession.<br>
      <br>
      By placing several slides, each operating on the associated web
      page, you can also vote the antenna structure several to be
      received or abzusendende wavelengths simultaneously and so examine
      spatial areas to determine whether they contained field conditions
      that exactly the two resonance wavelengths of the two sides
      justice and / or contain their electric or magnetic component.<br>
      <br>
      Another important aspect of the invention provides that a
      plurality of conductor track systems are arranged in the plane or
      in space to at least a three-sided prismatic or otherwise shaped
      body.<br>
      <br>
      This can be received different physical phenomena and / or
      transmitted and / or affected simultaneously several with respect
      to wavelength and or their other physical properties.<br>
      <br>
      This phenomena can be analyzed and / or transmitted or
      corresponding fields are influenced simultaneously and / or
      generated Coupled and / or modulated.<br>
      <br>

      resonance-determining components can be assigned to the respective
      outer conductor and the common central conductor koppelnd each
      simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, non-linear mixing members may be arranged in the
      active compound.<br>

      Figs. 1 and 2 show the basic shape of an antenna as a first
      embodiment of the invention illustrating a first variant.<br>
      <br>
      On a substrate 21, the two interconnects are 25.1 and 25.2 mounted
      at a distance A from each other.<br>
      <br>
      These each have the width b and the thickness d.<br>
      <br>
      In this case - explained 36 42 436 A1 in more detail in DE-OS - b
      to reduce the width for an end.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time may be reduced according to the distance A.<br>
      <br>
      The thickness d may be variable, but this is difficult to
      implement in practice.<br>
      <br>
      The conductors 25.1 and 25.2 can be configured as a structure
      variable dielectric properties can be obtained as a metallic
      conductor or as a semiconductor or in the manner described in the
      patent application P 36 42 436th<br>
      <br>
      The carrier 21 has a length L1.<br>
      <br>
      The conductors 25.1 and 25.2 have a length L2, which may be equal
      to the length L1 or shorter.<br>
      <br>
      The carrier 21 has a width B which depends on the particular
      circumstances relating to the Head of Education, the head of
      distance and the base material of the carrier 21, said according
      to participate to the conditions on the dielectric action of the
      antenna described in DE-OS 36 42 436 A1 but does not have to.<br>
      <br>
      The peculiarity of the antenna 20 is that the strip conductors
      25.1 and 25.2 have no permanently attached cross-connect as a
      metallic compound, or as semiconducting, inductive and / or
      capacitive cross-connection and thus represent an open in both
      directions Lecher line system.<br>
      <br>
      For example, 25.1 and 25.2 two scales SK1 and SK2 are indicated
      between the two interconnects.<br>
      <br>
      These can be used to determine the position of the support to be
      provided to other devices, such as valves, auxiliary resonators,
      auxiliary antennas etc.<br>
      <br>
      Such scales can also be mounted outside of the conductors 25.1 and
      25.2.<br>
      <br>
      As Figure 2 shows, it can be provided that in Abweichunng of
      hitherto conventional antenna systems of this kind not only on one
      side - are provided strip conductors 25.1 and 25.2, but also that
      on the underside 22.2 another pair of conductors 25.3 and - top
      22.1 25.4 is mounted or formed.<br>
      <br>
      This may have a different design compared to the conductor track
      pair on the top.<br>
      <br>
      It can be formed in parallel with the same cross-sections and a
      conductor pair, together, running with him cross-sections
      corresponding to changing a conductor pair.<br>
      <br>
      One of the conductor pairs can have on a corresponding desired use
      purposes place a conductive cross-connection.<br>
      <br>
      This can be provided at an end or intermediate the ends at a
      suitable location.<br>
      <br>
      The two ends of the conductor tracks are designated by E1 and E2.<br>
      <br>
      The scale zero points can be set depending on the desired use
      conditions to the one or to the other end.<br>
      <br>
      However, you can also be provided at a location between the two
      ends and thus allow the light measuring in two directions.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows one of the Fig. 1 corresponding simplified view of an
      antenna 20.1, in which the scales are omitted and which is formed
      relatively short.<br>
      <br>
      Such antennas may have different, to be determined or emit
      wavelengths corresponding spatial dimensions.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 illustrates that a slider 30 slidably and accordingly
      maintained at such a carrier 21 in the longitudinal direction
      according to the arrow 31 towards both sides in the conventional
      manner, may be provided.<br>
      <br>
      To illustrate the various possibilities of configuration of the
      electrical, magnetic or mechanical properties of the slide a
      rectangle 32 is drawn.<br>
      <br>
      This is intended to illustrate that the slider 30 can be equipped
      for example with an abrasive on the interconnects 25.1 and 25.2
      electrically conductive connection.<br>
      <br>
      But it can also be provided with an education that 25.1 and 25.2
      produces an inductive connection between the two interconnects.<br>
      <br>
      However, it may also be a capacitive connection between the two
      conductor tracks formed by the configuration of the slider.<br>
      <br>
      Incidentally, the various tunable or replaceable oscillating
      circuit arrangements or retention arrangements for the
      introduction of information carriers to be coupled, as nosodes or
      material samples can be provided to radioactive emitters.<br>
      <br>
      The markings to be doing, tunable, inductive or capacitive
      elements or resonant oscillating circuits can be used by the
      antenna to be received or radiated wavelength for influencing or
      determining.<br>
      <br>
      Thereby, it is possible to use the antenna with respect to the
      spatial dimensions to extend with respect to the wavelength to be
      radiated or to be received or to shorten.<br>
      <br>
      This especially is a very simple, spatially small and very light
      in weight assembly is provided that can be configured previously
      unsuitable for receiving wavelengths primarily as a divining rod
      for the reception.<br>
      <br>
      However, it can also be used without the usual handles as tuning
      in technical, scientific or other receiver and transmitter
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      It can be used, positioned especially for influencing the field
      events, the living beings are exposed to
      electro-magnetic-mechanical phenomena at appropriate points.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 illustrates an antenna 20.2, the 20 corresponds in its
      basic structure of the antenna according to Fig. 1.<br>
      <br>
      She has, however, to the printed conductors 25.1 and 25.2
      Connection Tools 33.1 and 33.2 for the connection of bars 35.1 and
      35.2, as they have long been known for the designed after
      Lecherprinzip dowsing.<br>
      <br>
      Such handles are attached to the previously known applications at
      angles of about 90 Â° to 110 Â° to the longitudinal axis of the
      carrier 21.2.<br>
      <br>
      To illustrate the attachment of the attachment points 34 are
      indicated by dots.<br>
      <br>
      There, the handles can be riveted or screwed.<br>
      <br>
      However Furthermore 4 illustrate in Fig. Arrows 36 and 37, that
      the handles 35.1, 35.2, depending on the desired use conditions
      either via the conductively connected to the conductor tracks 25.1
      and 25.2 Connection aids 33.1, 33.2, for example, lateral
      extensions of the applied as layers printed conductors directly to
      the each conductor or can be connected to the slider 30 with the
      structure 32nd<br>
      These different slide 30 and different carriers may be used 21 if
      you want to use the divining rod for a particular type.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is the handles 35.1 and 35.2 also make interchangeable
      for optional connection to the carrier 21 or the slider 30th<br>
      <br>
      The handles 35.1 and 35.2 can be provided with the directions
      indicated by the lines 38 scales, because according to the new set
      forth herein, developed by the applicant / inventor procedure of
      using an open Lecher line in a divining also through the free
      spaces between the hands and the carrier (motherboard, terminal
      aids 33.1, 33.2) given AbgrifflÃ¤ngen can enter into the to be
      received or radiated wavelength of the entire system.<br>
      <br>
      The connection angle W1 between the respective grip 35 and the
      longitudinal extension of the board 20 corresponds to an opening
      angle OW1, which is in the order of 170 Â° to 180 Â°, in the
      embodiment of Fig. 4.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment of FIG. 5 again shows handles 35 as a rigid and not
      bendable in the essential elements, such as brass tubes, which
      now, however, at different angles respectively OW2<br>
      OW3 can be attached to the conductor tracks or connector elements
      33 on the slide 30.<br>
      <br>
      By placing such an acute angle relative to the apparent from the
      drawings, small angle mounted handles 35, the overall
      characteristics of the antenna system change significantly.<br>
      <br>
      By far her opening angle or OW2<br>
      <br>
      OW3 it is also possible to use considerably longer grips 35,
      thereby facilitating the handling of antenna systems with
      relatively long handles is made possible.<br>
      <br>
      These handles can be used with markings 38 for determining the
      free distances and thus to determine the so-called handle lengths.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6 illustrates how, instead of the rigid handles 35.1 and 35.2
      of the embodiments according to FIGS. 4 and 5 resilient handles
      can be used 45.1 and 45.2.<br>
      <br>
      These are, for example, from round plastic rods with diameters of
      a few mm, for example made 5-10 mm so that they can be kept low in
      the hands of a man and the weight attached to them, the carrier 21
      including slide 30 and, if necessary, and on or otherwise fastened
      to the support elements without any appreciable effect on their
      elastic electromagnetic properties.<br>
      <br>
      Then you can apply from the V-Rod, such as forks or simple plastic
      V-rods or metal V-Rod, with bendable properties ago known usage
      conditions, but now has the ability to much longer wavelengths up
      to wavelengths of many kilometers to receive with a very short
      construction instrument and thus the nature given, influenced by
      human structures or possibly reinforced box circumstances, to
      analyze particular cult buildings or to analyze waves technically
      produced with longer wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates an antenna 20.6, which is shown corresponding
      to Fig. 1 without the handle and the slider, although these can
      also be mounted according to Fig. 3 to 6.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, on a support 21.3 with the same conditions or
      facilities, as explained in connection with Figs. 1 and 2, three
      different lengths of conductor pairs 25a, 25b and 25c are
      illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      These together form respectively an open Lecher line from here,
      for example, of different lengths.<br>
      <br>
      There may also be provided equal lengths.<br>
      <br>
      These multiple conductor pairs or individual conductor tracks may
      also be on different sides of the support, also on a spatial
      support of greater thickness on the different sides, for example a
      prism, an equilateral or scalene prism or a prism having
      appropriate angles are 90 DEG or even thereof may vary, be
      appropriate.<br>
      <br>
      You can have each conductor pair is individually associated slide.<br>
      <br>
      A slider can be assigned to multiple conductor pairs.<br>
      <br>
      Also, a slider may be provided for a single conductor or more than
      two conductor tracks.<br>
      <br>
      The vane components can thereby galvanic contact with the
      conductor tracks may be formed as inductive and / or capacitive
      connection as and / or exposure to elements.<br>
      <br>
      The slide can then be set differently and, depending on the
      attachment of the handles on the interconnects or the slides can
      be varied receive or emit different wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      By using different types of valves, such as an inductive and a
      capacitive slider slider you can simultaneously on such an antenna
      structure to electrical and receive the magnetic portion of a
      corresponding field condition.<br>
      <br>
      On the third path could also tuned the mechanical portion of the
      field events suitable to adjust in appropriate training, taking
      into account the proportion of the field events with resulting
      from the ponderomotive forces or using this is related.<br>
      <br>
      Each conductor pair can each not only a slider, but it can also
      buy several slides can be provided.<br>
      <br>
      This may have the same characteristics, ie for example both be
      capacitive or inductive both slide.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the tuning accuracy can be increased.<br>
      <br>
      However, it may also provide a leading and a lagging slide and so
      both the electrical and received plus matched simultaneously with
      different wavelengths share the magnetic field of a condition or
      radiate.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, you may provide an additional component for certain
      purposes at the end of each conductor pair, for example, in the
      manner of a slide or a slip-on, which one endows with certain
      Einkoppelungseigenschaften, with a simple short circuit or with
      holders for coupled in information carriers or with coils,
      capacitors or formed therefrom resonant circuits and / or with
      other auxiliary antennas, as well as can be provided Peilantennnen
      chopsticks.<br>
      <br>
      Equally you can on the sliders in the manner known from DE-OS 36
      42 436 A1 provide PeilstÃ¤bchen that are to support cross or extend
      substantially in the plane of the carrier.<br>

      Inventor(s): JAEGER H-EUGEN<br>
      <br>
      In order to determine Earth rays, water vanes or radiation
      anomalies, use is made of a device consisting of two diviners, or
      of a corresponding unit. Each diviner consists of a rod and a rod
      part bent away therefrom. Arranged on the rod is a displaceable
      sleeve which can be displaced into a suitable position in
      accordance with the respective sensitivity of the user. Moreover,
      the rod part is constructed bent such that it can easily swivel in
      the hand, and is constructed with a long sleeve. <br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a Winkelrute for determining earth
      radiation, water veins or irregularities of radiations and
      currents, consisting of a longer, as a kind of antenna acting rod
      and a shorter, serving as a handle, an angle thereto extending,
      bent rod part.<br>
      <br>
      Dowsing rods are known in the form of a fork branch of hazel or a
      tree, which, inter alia, in the hands of suitable persons to
      prospect underground deposits of water, ores is intended to serve.<br>
      <br>
      Rashes of excited held divining show when walking on the use of
      land at the places where natural resources or any abnormalities
      are present.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known to produce such divining from a metallic forked
      part, whereby this device performs the function of the fork
      branch.<br>
      <br>
      Such dowsing can but effectively only by certain people who have
      specialized and are very sensitive, are handled.<br>
      <br>
      From DE-GM 83 13 306.2 a device is known, which is also called a
      dowsing rod, and consists of two bow-shaped rods that are held in
      the hand along pivot upon the occurrence of earth radiation or
      water veins.<br>
      <br>
      This device is intended to be easily used by anyone and even by
      children.<br>
      <br>
      Earth rays are hypothetical by Brockhaus, have never properly
      detected radiation that should have an impact on humans and
      animals allegedly.<br>
      <br>
      Now it has been found that notwithstanding the suffering of this
      scientific opinion from sleep disorders or other diseases people
      can be freed from their problems and sufferings when detected by
      an appropriate qualified investigators corresponding interference,
      field lines or water veins and change by displacing the couchette
      or Position or the like by appropriate repelling devices the
      influence of said field lines have been shut down.<br>
      <br>
      The determination of these harmful rays and electrical noise but
      still only trained and sensitive individuals possible.<br>
      <br>
      Also known from DE-GM 83 13 306.2 divining rods can be operated
      and handled only by very few people.<br>
      <br>
      The invention has for its object to provide a sensitivity of each
      user easily customizable safely and accurately acting Winkelrute.<br>
      <br>
      The object is achieved by providing a longitudinally slidable
      sleeve is disposed on the rod whose displacement is on both sides
      of the bar is limited and that the rod part is bent in the hand
      easily swiveled and / or designed.<br>
      <br>
      Such Winkelrute can be surprisingly handled by poorly trained or
      trained persons only briefly, because without great effort on the
      respective properties, they say the sensitivity of each person is
      einstellba.<br>
      For this purpose it is only necessary to bring the sleeve by
      sliding on the rod in a position which allows the user to
      manipulate his feelings or his disposition in accordance with the
      unit.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the adaptability of the Winkelrute progresses towards
      positive that the rod part is designed such that it can be easily
      pivoted to the operating hand, so that the respective influence of
      the person handling can be largely normalized and ruled by
      external circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      According to an expedient embodiment of the invention it is
      provided that the sleeve has on the inside of lip-like projections
      of rubber or plastics material, preferably in the form of
      ring-shaped protrusions.<br>
      <br>
      This makes it possible, but set for slight displacement of the
      sleeve on the rod the sleeve are each in a position where the
      corresponding sensitivity center of the user's has emerged.<br>
      <br>
      Above all, it is possible in this manner, the sleeve respectively
      to move only by small amounts, and to enable fine adjustment
      without great expense.<br>
      <br>
      Particularly easy to use and on the other hand also variable in
      the optical design of the inventive Winkelrute is because after a
      purposeful training d sleeve is designed as a plastic sleeve.<br>
      <br>
      This makes it both in terms of shape and color of many variations
      open, under certain circumstances, the color of the respective
      operator can be adjusted, so as to further reduce the sensitivity
      threshold.<br>
      <br>
      In order to make the aforementioned influencing the person by the
      shape and color of the sleeve specifically, the invention provides
      that the sleeve different from the color of the rod, preferably a
      shock color.<br>
      <br>
      This color scheme also has the advantage that the sleeve is always
      easily identifiable and thus bring in the respective position.<br>
      <br>
      Rod and bar part affect the operator due to their weight slightly
      or not, as is provided according to a further embodiment of the
      invention that rod and rod member are formed by a correspondingly
      curved aluminum tube and the sleeve and the rod ends deferred caps
      from a hard plastic tube piece.<br>
      <br>
      The deferred caps act again as a boundary for the displacement of
      the sleeve and on the other as shock protection or Operation
      protection that makes a separate machining of bar ends
      superfluous.<br>
      <br>
      If the sleeve in the respective position to be effectively fixed,
      it is advantageous if the sleeve is provided with a threaded bore
      in which an adjusting screw is guided, so that the sleeve in each
      case to the rod without any problem and indeed at any point can be
      set.<br>
      <br>
      Compared to a corresponding grid on the rod and the sleeve has
      such a configuration has the advantage that a very precise and the
      respective operator or their respective sensitivity corresponding
      adjustment is possible.<br>
      <br>
      To prevent injuries and especially around the sleeve can easily
      move, provided that it is tapered on both sides.<br>
      <br>
      If it turns out that the use coming sleeve for the particular
      sensitivity threshold of the operator is not sufficient, it is
      possible to make a further adjustment in accordance with an
      embodiment of the invention, by the sleeve is removably associated
      with a clamping ring.<br>
      <br>
      The clamping ring is simply pushed or clamped, so that due to the
      change in weight of the sleeve a very different effect on the
      respective sensitivity of the operator is then possible via the
      sleeve.<br>
      <br>
      To ensure even with mild cramps and influences from the outside
      world a flawless pivoting the rod member in hand, it is provided
      that a long-sleeve rotatably mounted on the rod member.<br>
      <br>
      This can pivot the Winkelrute even when fixed by external
      influences on the hand on the bar part of this.<br>
      <br>
      Especially a user-friendly is such a long-sleeve, if it is
      equipped with fingers adapted bulges.<br>
      <br>
      This accommodates mainly the influence of the operator, as it
      practically does not feel the long-sleeve and hence the position
      of the rod member and the impact of their fingers on the rod
      member attaches no special significance.<br>
      <br>
      The sensitivity can be selectively utilized much better to locate
      using the inventive Winkelrute earth radiation, water veins or
      anomalies anywhere in the home and outside of it.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of the sleeve through which the Winkelrute the respective
      sensitivity of the operator can be adjusted, the invention
      according to another embodiment that is sliding or rollable balls
      are housed in the rod and rod member.<br>
      <br>
      This makes it possible for staff to adapt both by the respective
      position of the ball within the rod or by assignment of several
      such balls Winkelrute the sensitivity of the operator.<br>
      <br>
      The balls are expediently designed as or provided with additives
      that they rest with a certain friction against the wall of the rod
      and the rod member.<br>
      <br>
      To targeted several such balls in the impact area, ie infiltrate
      into the rod, the invention provides that is arranged in the
      transition area between rod and rod member a actuable by hand to
      slide.<br>
      <br>
      Through ease of use may be as one or more balls are introduced
      into the bar, and then adjust by appropriate weight shift the
      Winkelrute the sensitivity of the respective operator.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is particularly characterized in that the respective
      sensitivity of the respective user easily customizable, secure and
      precise acting Winkelrute is created that is easy and adjustable
      in the operation of the particular user or is adaptable according
      to the structure of its properties.<br>
      <br>
      It is advantageous that such a device consisting of two such angle
      rods can be used after appropriate education of a much larger
      number of people, and this has the advantage that the active user
      in its own sphere by identifying relevant or earth radiation<br>
      <br>
      Watercourses or Radiation abnormalities also can provide faster
      and easier remedy because he or the respective radiation source<br>
      <br>
      Ray body may analyze the domestic realities better and change.<br>
      <br>

      become apparent from the following description of the accompanying

      Device for measuring electric, magnetic and electromagnetic force
      fields, rays or waves of unusual intensity which penetrate from
      the atmosphere to the or into the surface of the earth or are
      directed the other way (e.g. "Earth rays", injurious to health,
      produced by transformation substances - "Earth radio" - driven by
      potential differences or electric energies) and which are capable
      of initiating by means of attractive forces a disturbed state of
      equilibrium in an adjustable balance system, a different pointer
      deflection or a recording operation. However, the instruments
      supplied with an additional biological current cause only an
      intensified sensible deflection which points chiefly in a
      subjective way to the presence of a disturbing field.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      The invention relates to a radiation measuring device according to
      the divining principle to prospect for radiation, mainly from
      earth radiation than geobiologisches resonant circuit accessories.<br>
      <br>
      The adjustable balance system is the subjective iempirical
      measurement results of dowsers through exact scientific proof,
      Readability and replace repeatable scale readings.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the divining rod will have to be leveled
      emotionally sensitive to get a rash after the set medium.<br>
      <br>
      It depends on the skill of each individual dowser if he finds a
      sinful place or not.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it is known that a Elektrogeobioscope measures
      resistively precisely identifiable waves that indicate the
      presence of a certain radiation field.<br>
      <br>
      This resistance meter is firstly very expensive and always operate
      on the other hand only with auxiliary power.<br>
      <br>
      The technical complexity precludes the simple domestic and
      agricultural use.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is based, to obtain an uncomplicated, long-standing,
      low-cost instrument for detecting radiation, mainly from earth
      radiation that task.<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved by the fact that the divining rod material
      is applied as a beam display device so that this floating lingers
      at rest on the zero mark and indicative of the intensity of
      radiation at radiation exposure.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, a balancing system according to the second
      Newton's axiom min (Aktio equal Reaktio) is necessary.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, the elastic substances can pass directly or
      indirectly through aid mechanisms reaction pulses to the display
      material.<br>
      <br>
      Thus suitable as elastic materials, which are in the gaseous,
      liquid or solid state of nature.<br>
      <br>
      The latter can be made of rubber, which is mounted at the end of
      the display device can be parallel or at an acute angle to the
      pointer element cause highly sensitive rashes.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, this object is achieved with the generic device by
      the invariant characterizing features of claims 1-3.<br>

      The advantages achieved with the invention consist, in particular,
      that on purely mechanical, but also with other physical options on
      combinable fashion ways, means and methods are found, which can
      ensure a universal application in commercial, domestic, farming

      <br>
      In order to screen off the stimulating action of earth radiation
      onto the divining rod in a region above a surface of soil or space
      there is proposed an arrangement of U-shaped bracket elements (2)
      of wire mounted in a regular, sheet-like distribution pattern (x,
      y), the legs (2.1) being directed vertically downwards in the
      effective direction. The web sections (2.2) of adjacent bracket
      elements connecting the bracket legs (2.1) are arranged at an
      angle of about 45-90 DEG relative to one another in order to
      achieve approximately the same screening effect over the entire
      area. <br>
      <br>
      Dowsing causing irritation in the area above a room or soil
      surface arrangement for the elimination of the rash of divining
      causing irritation in the area above a room or Ground surface<br>
      <br>
      It is known that so-called on Erdstrahle stimuli appealing people
      for longer stays in areas where irritation can be detected, for
      example, with the divining rod or a sidereal pendulum, with
      chronic diseases, such as rheumatism, heart problems etc., also
      insomnia, can involve nervousness, headaches and the like health
      disorders without that an external cause of this would be seen.<br>
      <br>
      Well known are also the same stimulus influences recycled diseases
      in domestic animals, as in cattle, horses, pigs, etc., what
      animals is no longer a free choice of location by the stabling
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly old are also the efforts to eliminate this ground
      stimuli where they cause the said harmful effects for humans and
      animals.<br>
      <br>
      The simplest measure, the Dodge has of course always proved
      attractive to free zones.<br>
      <br>
      However, the challenge the truth of problems of modern life
      organization that few alternatives leaves through optimal
      utilization of space and ground generally.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the modern construction practices and building
      materials such as reinforced concrete, in arbitrary directions in
      floor flooring laid unshielded electric lines, water, gas and
      central heating pipes the spread of so-called. Geopathogenic zones
      on the one hand are more conducive, and on the other hand to limit
      the alternatives more.<br>
      <br>
      Observations have shown that in a "contaminated" by stimulus zones
      face portion above a certain catchment area of â€‹â€‹U- or
      horseshoe-shaped bent metal arms, the legs of which at least
      approximately vertically downwards reported, weakening the
      divining rash occurs.<br>
      <br>
      The effect is limited to a relatively small area.<br>
      <br>
      These observations, however, were remarkable enough to follow the
      declaration made on, especially as also the relevant literature,
      for example. Scripture "harmful influences of soil and
      bautenschÃ¤dliche charms of Jos. A. Kopp, Swiss publishing house AG
      Zurich (1965), and "Invisible Environment" by Herbert L. King,
      appeared self-published by the author, D-8000 MÃ¼nchen ( 2 Edition
      1977) deals with the shield of stimulus zones, but without this
      propose concrete measures.<br>
      <br>
      Seems clear, however, due to coinciding with references
      observations of the patent proprietor, for example, concrete
      reinforcement and continuous metal plates in the range of floor
      areas of irritation no appreciable Abschirmeffekg against the
      assets exercise the divining rash causing ground stimuli.<br>
      <br>
      Continued attempts due to the observed effect of a downwardly open
      U-shaped metal bracket on the divining rash in the area of â€‹â€‹a
      floor Sexy Zone showed then that by arranging a larger number of
      such bow in a specific distribution pattern a surface effective
      weakening of the rods rash inducing stimulus occurs.<br>
      <br>
      By suitable choice of the bracket dimensions, the mutual distances
      between adjacent single bracket and their action-orientation,
      virtually complete elimination of the irritant effect could be
      achieved in the dowsing.<br>
      <br>
      It is noteworthy that shows the effect not only when using metal
      brackets, but also when using ironing out certain plastics.<br>
      <br>
      By contrast, proved the so-called multi-bucks, geographically
      limited elements with more than two interconnected by a plate
      member downwardly extending legs as unfit by showed no weakening
      of the rod deflection.<br>

      The present invention, the above-mentioned effect in a practically
      usable form PERFORMING arrangement for the elimination of the rash
      of divining causing irritation in the area above a room or soil
      surface is characterized by the structural features of claim 1.<br>

      <br>
      As an alternative to bracket assemblies as shown in FIGS. 2d and

      <br>
      Double handle element 20 in the form of an H in accordance with
      FIG. 5a, in order to achieve the effect of alternately up and down

        <b>Divining rod for one-handed operation - has cylindrical brass
          grip holding wire with swinging object at end</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): OBERBACH JOSEF<br>
      <br>
      The single-handed operation test or divining rod can be used in
      similar manner to conventional two-handed rods and produces more
      precise measurements. It does not require such skill in achieving
      successful results as do conventional rods. An oscillatory
      indicator section (2) attached to a handgrip section (1) consists
      of a wire fixed into the cylindrical grip with a terminating
      element (3) attached to its opposite end. The hand grip (1) may be
      a hollow cylinder or tube (4) of brass with a gold or silvered
      covering and can be filled with liquid or other material. The wire
      passes through a metal plug (5) in the lower end of the grio to a
      bush (8) attached to the plug (7) in the upper end of the grip.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a one-handed testing or dowsing, which is
      similar to the already known two-handed divining rods used, and
      can moreover be used in other precise measurements.<br>
      <br>
      Dowsing can be used known since the earliest times and consist of
      a forked branch.<br>
      <br>
      For example, fork-wood rods of hazel or willow known where such
      rods but occasionally also consist of a metal wire or of an
      elastic material.<br>
      <br>
      The dowser holds the rod when using it with both hands at the ends
      of branches generally horizontally in voltage.<br>
      <br>
      Rashes the rod up or down to show, for example, to water resources
      or natural resources.<br>
      <br>
      From dowsers the divining rod is sometimes used also for
      displaying respected as pathogenic stimulus stripes on the surface
      as well as other studies.<br>
      <br>
      After a generally accepted scientific clarification of the
      function of a divining rod has not been achieved, the usefulness
      of the WUnschelruten is controversial.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that the function of a divining rod is not yet clear in a
      generally recognized scientific manner, but does not detract from
      their actual usefulness, so long as the outcome of interest (for
      example, the discovery of a vein of water) is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      While the previously known dowsing presupposed to successfully
      execute measurements comparatively high skills when dowser. the
      present invention is the object to provide a divining rod, which
      does not have the disadvantage mentioned, precise and
      comprehensive measurements allowed.<br>
      <br>
      To achieve the above object, the invention provides a one-handed
      Testrute (Biotensor), which consists of a single handle portion,
      in which an ending in a final element wire is attached in such a
      way that the wire easy to vibrate can be set together with the
      final element.<br>
      <br>
      In the inventive rod is even an advantage that it can be held with
      one hand.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the display portion formed of wire and terminal
      element (tensor) can not only vibrate in a plane, but execute
      arbitrary particular horizontal, senkrechteund circular motions.<br>
      <br>
      Further preferred embodiments of the invention result in
      particular from the dependent claims and from the following
      description based on the drawing.<br>
      <br>
      First, it should be already pointed out at this juncture that it
      is in general to be a polarized tester to investigate energy
      states of electrical, magnetic and atomic polarities and
      activities in nature, in the human organism and of technical
      devices in the inventive Testrute.<br>
      <br>
      The bi-polarization is thereby forced from bioenergy system during
      the touching by the living people.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive device provides then by oscillations or vibrations,
      ie,<br>
      <br>
      Motions of the tensor data on the polarized charge states of
      vulnerable energy sources, which are recorded by sensors and
      transmitted through the human body induction response to the
      device.<br>
      <br>
      Since it has not yet succeeded in producing physical measuring
      instruments that operate as universal and provide similar values,
      are the results of research using the he findngsgemÃ¤ssen
      one-handed Testrute (Biotensor) of widely recognize the importance
      for many areas of daily life and medicine ,<br>
      <br>
      In the following preferred embodiments of Biotensors describes
      according to the invention based on the drawing; in the drawings
      show: Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through an exemplary
      embodiment of the inventive Biotensors;. Fig. 2 is a schematic
      representation of a part of the display part or tensor.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred embodiment of shown in Figure 1. Of the inventive
      one-hand Testrute (Biotensor) has in general a handle part 1 and
      attached thereto a display portion (tensor). 2<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="de3027367.jpg" height="422"
          width="631"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      The display portion 2 preferably consists of a wire 6, which is
      fixed with its one end to or in the handle part 1, while at the
      other end a closure member (receiving section) 3 is fixed.<br>
      <br>
      The handle part 1 is preferably formed in the shape of a cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the cylinder is a hollow cylinder
      and consists of a metal tube 4.<br>
      <br>
      However, the handle portion 1 and the pipe 4 may not necessarily
      be made of metal, wherein the metal is, however, preferred.<br>
      <br>
      For the two people aupttypen play in a certain sense, their
      typical sensitivities involved.<br>
      <br>
      The "Vagoto- technician" = K-type (temperature-sensitive type)
      responded particularly well to silver.<br>
      <br>
      The "sympathicotonic" = W-type (heat-sensitive type) is sensitive
      to gold.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a silver or silver-plated handle part is suited to
      "Vagoto- technician", while a gilded handle part is advisable for
      the "sympathicotonic".<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, a sealing plug 5 is attached to the
      front or (in the drawing) of the right end of the tube 4.<br>
      <br>
      The plug 5 is preferably made of metal, but may also consist of
      any other material.<br>
      <br>
      A bore 10 extends through the stopper and the center serves to
      receive the wire 6.<br>
      <br>
      The wire 6 is unchangeable secured in the bore 10, for example, by
      a stamping or soldering.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to provide an obliquely inwardly extending
      bore 10 to threaded bore for receiving a fixing screw which fixes
      the wire inside the plug. 5<br>
      <br>
      By loosening the screw, not shown in the threaded hole 9 then the
      length of the wire can be adjusted depending on the wire diameter,
      the elasticity of the wire material and the weight of the
      terminating element 3 to the optimal length.<br>
      <br>
      Uberlicherweise but the Biotensor is supplied with built already
      correspondingly adjusted wire, so no connection thread 9 need not
      be provided.<br>
      <br>
      Wire 6 can stretch into the cavity formed by the pipe in 4 or also
      end in the plug. 5<br>
      <br>
      Preferably extends the wire 6 to the vicinity of a socket 8, which
      is arranged end of the pipe 4 in an end plate 7 at the rear
      (left), which is mounted in turn on the left end of the tube. 4<br>
      <br>
      The diameter of the tube 4 (or in general of the handle part 1?<br>
      is selected such that a good grip gives contact with the skin
      sensors for plus pole and minus pole fuels.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the diameter is in the range of 22 to 28 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Preferred handle lengths are between 70 mm and 280 mm.<br>
      <br>
      The display portion (tensor) 2 is, as mentioned, formed by the
      wire 6 and the end panel. 3<br>
      <br>
      The length of the wire depends on the elasticity of the,
      preferably consisting of spring steel wire 6 as well as the weight
      of the closure element 3.<br>
      <br>
      The wire may also be formed from Berylliumdraht or as a plastic
      rod or pole.<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the closing element 3 is shown in
      the form of a ring which is made of solid metal and in
      cross-section is substantially rectangular runs (flat ring).<br>
      <br>
      The ring is preferably smooth on its one flat side, while the
      other flat side is grooved or roughened.<br>
      <br>
      The closing element 3 can also be designed so with or without
      perforation in the form of a hollow ring or a round plate, a
      quadrangular plate, a hexagonal plate.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the cavity formed by the tube 4 completely passing
      through the wire 6, which is attached at the left end in the
      closing element 7, results in a better posture, causing a rash of
      the display part easily comes off.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 2, a preferred embodiment of a part of the display part is
      shown.<br>
      <br>
      At the wire 9 is a closure element 3, z.<br>

      A silver coating, as well as causes a corrugation or roughening a
      negative polarization of this side, while, conversely, a smooth or
      plated side causes a positive polarization.<br>
      <br>
      The inventive Biotensor is sensitively includes the use with the
      right hand, both feet are always fully loaded on the floor (ground
      contact).<br>
      <br>
      The right foot is preferably provided forward in affener stance
      somewhat.<br>
      <br>
      A good contact with the skin clean handle of bio tensor is
      important, especially the skin contact with the sensitive
      fingertips.<br>
      <br>
      An excessive skin resistance to dry and thick skin is canceled in
      water and vinegar (apple cider vinegar) because of Isoliereffektes
      by washing and a brief immersion of the hands.<br>
      <br>
      Only then gets the testers accurate readings.<br>
      <br>
      The left hand should be closed during testing in the form of fist
      formation because otherwise the sensors in the left palm still
      could transmit other energy forces on the tester with.<br>
      <br>
      Affect rubber-soled shoes or impede SensiblitÃ¤t.<br>
      <br>
      The Biotensor is not capable of action without the sensors of the
      human body.<br>
      <br>
      About the above-mentioned connector in the handle of an electronic
      amplifier with Biotensors body same 10 Hz can be connected
      frequency pulses.<br>
      <br>
      This would affect the sensorium in the tests, the feedback effects
      (bio-resonance) are visible as oscillation values.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned may be used in place of a wire also generally an
      elongate member, for example, the aforementioned plastic rod or
      rods.<br>

      Harmful radiations from underground water sources, which penetrate
      buildings in a vertical direction, are deflected by laying
      electrodes perpendicular to the direction of flow of the water, in
      building e.g. in the cellar or any floor. Conventional welding
      electrodes are used with a core of Ni or other metal, having a
      length of approx. 50 cm. A water divining rod is used to determine
      the position and direction of flow of the water, and the electrode
      is placed on the inside of an outer wall of the building, dividing
      the area affected into two zones, one penetrated by radiations and
      one including the building, free from radiations.<br>

        </b><b>ADJUSTABLE DIVINING ROD DEVICE</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): VENDITTI A<br>
      <br>
      There is disclosed herein equipment for a game including a
      divining rod device, gameboard and playing cards. The divining rod
      device includes a handle member having pivotally attached thereto
      a counterbalanced arm or rod with a magnet at one end thereof. The
      gameboard is of laminated construction and has a metal innerlayer.
      The playing cards have various indicia thereon and are positioned
      at indicated locations on the gameboard. The divining rod device
      is held by the handle member substantially parallel with the board
      and several inches thereabove. The end of the rod with the magnet
      is in the form of a pointer which is swept back and forth over the
      board until this end makes contact with a card on the board
      because of the attraction of the magnet to the board. In this
      manner, a card is selected to thereby provide a "reading"
      according to the game.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to games and the like and more particularly
      to divining rod equipment utilizing the principals of magnetic
      attraction for providing a new game.<br>
      <br>
      The present game combines the age-old mysteries of the divining
      rod and the lodestone to provide interesting answers or results,
      which are called herein "psychomagnetic" results or readings. As a
      background, it should first be mentioned that in the past there
      were two very closely related ancient forms of divination. The
      first was Belomancy in which an arrow was tossed in the air so
      that a person could start in the direction toward which it finally
      pointed, and the second was Rhabdomancy, where a wand served a
      similar purpose but was retained lightly in the grasp of the
      operator thereby allowing the wand to waiver until it settled on a
      course.<br>
      <br>
      According to history, these devices became more than just
      primitive directional finders. They were used to indicate an
      object, pick out a person from a group, and answer questions by
      pointing one way for "yes" and another for "no." Rhabdomancy, in
      particular, lent itself to further development by the "wise" men
      of their day, whose wands could designate scrolls on which names
      had been written. The wand came to be recognized as a symbol of
      magical authority, a distinction that it held up until modern
      times.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, however, the earlier practitioners of this type of
      divination, the Chaldeans and the Persians, had carried it into
      Scythia, the region north of the Black Sea; and from there, it
      eventually reached some of the Germanic tribes. They frequently
      practiced it in crude form, simply using twigs or small branches
      from trees, casting them on the ground, or gripping them,
      whichever suited the particular purpose or occasion.<br>
      <br>
      Along with the divining rod was another ancient discovery that was
      popularly associated with it, though one belonged in the mental
      realm and the other was purely physical. That other marvel was the
      lodestone, a peculiar type of mineral rock which had the power of
      attracting iron. For centuries this phenomenon was attributed to a
      magical or supernatural force, and with the invention of the
      mariner's compass toward the Thirteenth Century A.D. the
      superstition increased. Since the compass constantly pointed
      north, people imagined that there must be a huge mountain of
      magnetic iron somewhere in that icy realm, powerful enough to draw
      the nails from an approaching ship and thereby wreck it.<br>
      <br>
      Such beliefs forged a stronger link between the compass and the
      divining rod, particularly in mining areas. Only iron drew the
      compass needle from the true north, but it seemed logical that
      other metals might give off invisible emanations akin to magnetism
      that could be picked up by the divining rod. It was put to the
      test in the Hartz Mountains of Germany as early as the year 1430
      using the primitive rods cut from tree branches, and soon it
      became an accepted method of locating sites for new mines.<br>
      <br>
      While various types of rods were used, including both straight and
      curved, the most popular form was a forked tree branch that
      enabled the operator to grip both ends and extend the main portion
      forward so that it would dip when attracted by the underground
      metal. According to contemporary accounts, this form of divination
      was successful and it was later brought to England by German
      miners who were hired to develop new mines in Cornwall and Wales.
      There, the results were reportedly quite satisfactory and the only
      reason that it was finally abandoned was because after many years,
      the mines were worked out and there was no use bothering with them
      any longer.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, in France, diviners had been using forked rods to
      locate lost objects and trace missing persons, but that also
      proved to be a limited field. As with all new discoveries and
      inventions that have proven their worth, the trend was to put the
      divining rod to the greatest possible use and that proved to be
      the search for water, the universal element which all humanity
      needs. Again, success greeted the diviners and "waterwitching" as
      it came to be known, spread rapidly through Europe and America,
      and today, after several centuries, it is still practiced.<br>
      <br>
      Another theory offered to explain dowsing, as waterwitching is
      more correctly termed, is that the dowser, while walking above an
      underground stream, subconsciously picks up a slight vibration and
      responds with an instinctive muscular action that causes the rod
      to dip. If true, this is no more remarkable than the fact that a
      scientific instrument called the seismograph can register tremors
      from an earthquake thousands of miles away. But something more
      than vibration is obviously involved when modern dowsers
      apparently find water by running a divining rod above a
      large-scale map, instead of the actual ground.<br>
      <br>
      All this has produced further theories involving cosmic rays or
      occult forces, which in turn can be linked with astrological lore
      and planetary influences, while modern experimenters with the
      divining rod have attributed its operation to extrasensory
      perception, thus merging the old with the new.<br>
      <br>
      With this background in mind, be it true or folklore, the present
      concepts may be generally described as a new combination of the
      age-old ideas of Rhabdomancy and the lodestone to provide a new
      and novel game for producing "psychomagnetic" results. The present
      game equipment includes a magnetic divining rod device having
      handles and a balanced rod pivotally supported thereby. A pointer
      end of the rod includes a magnet, and with the rod pivotally hung
      and balanced from the handles, it is sensitive to the slightest
      subconscious impulse. A gameboard is provided having a metal
      innerlayer to which the magnet is attracted when the pointer end
      is moved sufficiently close to the board. With certain indicia on
      the board, either printed thereon or in the form of charts or
      cards, the attraction of the pointer to any particular indicia
      provides what may be termed a "psychomagnetic" reading or answer.<br>
      <br>
      The concepts of this game and equipment used therein briefly
      described above and discussed in more detail below are the subject
      of copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12,907 now U.S. Pat.
      No. 3,640,537 titled "Magnetic Divining Rod Game Equipment" filed
      in the name of Messrs. Klamer and Levy. The present invention
      relates to a particular form of magnetic divining rod device
      wherein the rod portion thereof may be readily adjusted for
      achieving desired balance thereof and firmly maintained in the
      selected position, and which may be manufactured relatively
      inexpensively.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is a principal object of this invention to provide
      a novel construction for a magnetic divining rod device.<br>
      <br>
      It is an additional object of this invention to provide an
      adjustable magnetic divining rod device for use as game equipment.<br>

      </b><br>
      Briefly, there is disclosed herein a new game and suitable
      equipment used in playing the game. The equipment includes a
      magnet divining rod device comprising a handle member having
      pivoted thereunder an elongated rod which is weighted at one end
      and has a magnet affixed to the other end thereof, the latter end
      serving as the pointer end of the rod. The rod is attached to a
      support bracket, and is adjustable with respect to the bracket for
      balancing the rod, and the bracket is pivotally coupled with the
      underside of the handle member. The gameboard may be of any
      suitable size and form and have at least a metallic portion to
      which the magnet of the pointer may be attracted. An exemplary
      board is of laminated construction with a thin steel sheet
      laminated between paper and/or chipboard. The playing cards have
      various indicia thereon and may be circular and cut from suitable
      paper material.<br>
      <br>
      Turning now to the drawings, FIG. 1 is a perspective view of the
      present magnetic divining rod device. This device includes a
      handle member generally designated 10 which is composed of a pair
      of handles 11 and 12 joined to a central support section 13. The
      entire structure 11-13 may be formed of any suitable material, and
      typically is molded of polypropylene, and may be of any desired
      form and shape. A wire brad 14 is press fitted into a pair of
      apertures in the underside of the support section 13. A support
      bracket 15 is hung from the brad 14 and supports a divining rod
      generally designated 16. The bracket 15 has an aperture 17 through
      which the brad 14 extends for pivotally supporting or hanging the
      support 15 from the handle member 10. The interior edge of the
      operature 17 is relatively sharp as best seen in FIG. 3B to
      provide a minimum friction coupling with the brad.<br>
      <br>
      The rod 16 may be a cylindrical rod portion 19 having a pointer 20
      at the forward end thereof and a counterbalance 21 at the other
      end thereof. The pointer 20 has a magnet 22 secured thereto, and
      the counterbalance 21 has a weight 23 secured thereto. The entire
      rod 16 may be molded from plastic, and the magnet 22 and weight 23
      may be heat sealed in the respective ends of the rod. The pointer
      20 of the rod is off set several degrees, for example 10 DEG, from
      the longitudinal axis of the rod as best seen in FIG. 3A. This
      offset enables the entire device to be tilted downward slightly
      while maintaining the magnet 22 substantially parallel with the
      gameboard while playing the game as will be explained
      subsequently.<br>
      <br>
      The rod portion 19 includes an intermediate rectangular section 25
      having V-grooves 26 on the upper part thereof. These grooves mate
      with similar V-grooves 27 in the lower portion 28 of the support
      bracket 15. As is best seen in FIGS. 3A and 3B, the lower portion
      28 of the bracket 15 is in the form of a rectangular channel into
      which the section 25 of the rod 19 fits. The V-grooves on the
      section 25 and bracket 15 allow relative adjustment, and thus
      balancing, of the rod 16 and also provide a tight friction fit to
      secure the rod 19 to the support 15. This is a relatively simple
      and easily manufactured construction whereby both adjustment and a
      secure fit are obtained. The balance of the rod 16 is changed by
      removing the rod from the channel section 28 and reinserting the
      rod at a different position, but with the grooves 26 and 27
      properly mating.<br>
      <br>
      The gameboard 30 with which the magnetic divining rod device is
      used is illustrated in FIGS. 4A and 4B. The board 30 is
      essentially in the form of a typical gameboard and may be made to
      fold in the middle as indicated by dashed lines 31, but is of
      particular laminated construction inasmuch as the board must
      include on its surface or within its construction a suitable metal
      to which the magnet 22 is attracted. An exemplary laminated
      structure is illustrated in FIG. 4B and includes (a) an upper
      layer of paper 32 such as lithograph label stock, (b) a sandwich
      of 50 pound book stock 33, two mil steel 34, and 50 pound book
      stock 35, (c) a layer 36 of shipboard, such as twenty-one basis
      chipboard, and finally (d) a back wrapper 37. The various layers
      may be secured together with any suitable adhesive. An exemplary
      board is 19 3/8 inches square with two pieces of steel 34a and 34b
      as indicated in FIG. 4A, each slightly smaller than each board
      half to provide a three-sixteenths inch margin all around each
      piece of steel. With this size board, the length of the rod 16 may
      be 18 2/3 inches. A suitable magnet may be 1 1/16 inch long, and
      three-sixteenths inch wide and high.<br>
      <br>
      The board includes suitable markings to indicate positions for the
      playing cards. These markings include the nine circles 40-48
      around the upper part of the "sun" 49 and the lower "Planetary,"
      "Divination," "Fate," "Zodiac", and "Numerology" circles 50-54 at
      the bottom of the board. The lower four circles 56-59 indicate the
      original sections where the playing cards (FIGS. 5-8) normally are
      stacked.<br>
      <br>
      Although it will be appreciated that any suitable indicia may be
      provided on the board in any suitable manner, such as printing
      directly thereon, separate charts, separate cards, and so forth,
      individual playing cards as illustrated in FIGS. 5 through 8 are
      preferred. Each of these cards has various indicia printed thereon
      to provide a "reading" in producing the "psychomagnetic" results
      mentioned earlier. FIG. 5 illustrates suitable Planetary cards,
      FIG. 6 illustrates suitable Zodiac cards, FIG. 7 illustrates
      suitable Numerology cards, and FIG. 8 illustrates suitable
      Divination cards. Each card may be diecut to a circle having a
      diameter of 2 1/4 inches from three-ply paper stock. The indicia
      and suitable colors may be imprinted thereon. For example, one
      side of the cards are imprinted as illustrated in FIGS. 5 through
      8, and the backs of these cards may be labelled "Planetary,"
      "Zodiac," "Numerology," and "Divination."<br>
      <br>
      In playing a game with the present magnetic divining rod
      equipment, certain cards are placed on the gameboard 30. The
      handles 11 and 12 of the divining rod device 10 are held with both
      hands of the operator and with the pointer 20 facing away from the
      operator. The pointer 20 should be about four inches above the
      gameboard and substantially parallel thereto with the pointer 20
      floating above the cards. The divining rod device 10 is then moved
      slowly over the entire set of cards from one end to the other
      while lowering it gradually, but without conscious control, until
      it dips sufficiently far that it is drawn to one card. The indicia
      on the face of this card then provides certain information
      depending upon which aspect of the present game is being
      conducted. Set forth below are suitable and exemplary rules which
      may be used in playing the present game.<br>
      <br>
      The rod 16 is adjusted with respect to the bracket 15 as noted
      earlier so that the pointer 20 tips down slightly. Each set of
      cards illustrated in respective FIGS. 5 through 8 is shuffled and
      placed face down on the four lower circles 56-59 at the bottom of
      the gameboard 30. Different types of readings can be made. For a
      full reading, the Planetary cards illustrated in FIG. 5 are placed
      face down on the nine circles 40-48 around the sun 49 at the top
      of the gameboard 30. It is not necessary to place the cards down
      in any particular order, and the tenth card is placed face down in
      the Fate circle 52 below the sun. The rod device 10 is held above
      the board with the pointer 20 approximately four inches above the
      board as noted earlier. It is moved slowly over the entire line of
      nine circles 40-48 above the sun from one end to the other, and is
      lowered gradually until it dips down onto one card. The designated
      card is turned up and placed face up in the Planetary circle 50.
      The other Planetary cards are removed from the upper circles 40-48
      and replaced in their original section 56 at the bottom of the
      board, with the exception of the card in the Fate circle 52 which
      remains through the next stage of the game. The selected Planetary
      card which is now face up on the Planetary circle 50 indicates the
      subject best suited for continued divination. A question is
      mentally selected pertaining to the subject on the face up
      Planetary card. For example, with the card Venus-Love and Romance,
      the question may be, "Is love coming my way now?"<br>
      <br>
      The Divination cards on the circles 57 are now used in finding an
      answer to the above question. The nine Divination cards
      illustrated in FIG. 8 are placed face down on the nine circles
      40-48 around the sun in any order. Again, the rod 16 is moved over
      the layout until drawn down to one of the cards. The selected card
      is turned face up and if it indicates Yes, No, Favorable, or
      Doubtful, it is placed on the Divination circle 51 on the
      gameboard! The other Divination cards are removed and replaced in
      their section 57 at the bottom of the gameboard.<br>
      <br>
      If the selected card indicates Not Concentrating, the Divination
      cards are gathered up, mixed and replaced at 57, using the rod for
      another try. If the card that turns up indicates Fate, the card
      now in the planetary circle 50 is removed and put back with the
      others at 56, and the card in the Fate circle 52 is turned up and
      transferred to the Planetary circle 50 instead. Since this
      provides a new subject, all the Divination cards are gathered,
      mixed, and replaced at 57 while concentrating on a new question.<br>
      <br>
      As an example of a change of this nature, if the Planetary card
      from the Fate circle should be Neptune-Travel, the question, "Is
      love coming my way now?" might be changed to, "Am I going to take
      a trip?" Again, the rod is used to obtain a "psychomagnetic"
      answer.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever the answer from the Divination cards, the Zodiac cards
      can then be used to determine the time of its fulfillment. The
      nine Zodiac cards are placed at random in the upper circles 40-48
      and the other three are stacked in the Fate circle 52, all face
      down. The rod is used again to find a card which, when turned up,
      will indicate the period in which to expect results, good or bad.
      This card is placed in the Zodiac circle 53.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming that the question, "Is love coming my way?" was answered
      by a Yes card, the Zodiac card is used to tell when. If No is the
      answer, one mentally asks, "When should I ask this question
      again?" or "How long will I have to wait?" If the Divination card
      said Favorable, the Zodiac card indicates a period which is most
      ardent in the purpose. If Doubtful, it indicates the period when
      caution is to be used.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternate example, assume the question came from the
      Neptune-Travel card and was worded, "Am I going to take a trip?"
      and if the Divination card should indicate Yes, the Zodiac card
      indicates the probable period. If the Divination card should be
      No, it would signify not at that period, or that a trip should be
      avoided at that time. With Favorable, that could be the time to
      take the trip if possible; with Doubtful, a disappointment or
      postponement is indicated.<br>
      <br>
      If the period stated on the Zodiac card is just past, almost gone,
      or in any way doubtful, the top card in the Fate circle 52 can be
      turned up to obtain an alternative answer. In fact, turning up
      that card is a good policy, as it may suggest a time for action,
      or inaction, as the case may be.<br>
      <br>
      For a final test, the Zodiac cards are removed from the upper
      circles 40-48, replaced in their section 58, and the Numerology
      cards are used to determine a specific day which may be favorable
      or which should be avoided. To do this, the Numerology cards
      numbered from 1 to 7 are mixed and placed face down on the upper
      circles 41-47, leaving the end circles open. The rod is passed
      over the seven-card layout. The card selected indicates the day of
      the week, counting the days of the week as 1 for Sunday, through
      to 7 for Saturday, on which results may occur.<br>
      <br>
      In all "full" readings as described above, there are four regular
      steps, utilizing the Planetary cards, Divination cards, Zodiac
      cards and Numerology cards, in that order. Even if a question is
      answered by No on a Divination card, the reading can be continued,
      because the Zodiac and Numerology cards tell the period and day of
      negative results or disappointment.<br>
      <br>
      However, with more specialized questions, there is no reason to
      continue if a Divination card comes up with No as an answer. For
      example: in its first run, the rod settles on the Planetary card
      for Mercury, which signifies Luck or Chance. The question "Should
      I invest in a new industrial plant?" is asked, and the Divination
      cards are placed around the sun. If the rod brings up the answer
      "No," that is it, and it is no use trying to find out when not to
      invest. The subject should be dropped and proceed on to some other
      question, or another person should have a try.<br>
      <br>
      As the questions become still more specialized, the routine can be
      altered further to suit the case. That in itself provides
      intriguing situations which produce more fun.<br>
      <br>
      Special readings and their treatment are discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      1. The Planetary cards are dealt to the circles 40-48 and the rod
      settles on Venue-Love and Romance. The individual puts the mental
      question: "Am I going to have a new romance?" The Divination cards
      are dealt and the answer comes up Yes. (If No, the question would
      be dropped; but with Favorable or Doubtful, it can be carried
      further, as with Yes.)<br>
      <br>
      Now, the individual makes a list of persons who might figure in
      the new romance, numbering them, as: 1--Janie, 2--Mary, 3--Kay,
      4--Helen, 5--Candy, and 6--Mystery. The sixth "mystery" should be
      included in case the individual is uncertain about most of the
      others. In any case, the Numerology cards are now utilized, from 1
      to 6 (or 1 to 5, if the mystery is not included). Again, the rod
      is called into play to pick the future object of the individual's
      affection.<br>
      <br>
      2. The Planetary cards are dealt and the rod settles on
      Mercury-Luck and Chance. Assume that it so happens that the
      individual is thinking of going to the races tomorrow. He places
      the Divination cards and asks: "Should I go the races tomorrow?"
      If he goes to the races regularly, that would be unnecessary, but
      if there is any doubt, he should ask this question. Assume that
      the rod responds Yes. Again, the individual mixes and places those
      same cards and asks "Have I any chance of winning?" If the answer
      is Yes, Favorable, or even Doubtful, he can continue. But assuming
      that the answer is on the positive or possible side, then he deals
      out the Numerology cards, asking the question, "Which is the best
      race?" If it comes up 3, he uses the same cards again, asking,
      "Which is the best horse in the race?" If it comes up 6, this
      indicates Number 6 in the 3rd race.<br>
      <br>
      3. The Planetary cards are dealt and the rod settles on
      Jupiter-Wealth and Ambition. Assume that the individual has three
      prospective business partners, who might help gain these aims. The
      Divination cards are dealt out, and an example question is, "Can I
      succeed in my coming deal?" The rod then settles on Yes or
      Favorable. The problem now, is which partner. They can be numbered
      and the Numerology cards used, but their birth signs can be used
      if their birthdays are known and are at different times of the
      year. One may be called Mr. Taurus, another Mr. Scorpio, the
      third, Mr. Libra, and the three Zodiac cards bearing those signs
      are layed out. Again, the rod is used to see what turns up.<br>
      <br>
      4. Assuming that a girl about to be married turns up a card saying
      Venus-Love and Romance, her next question might be: "Will I have
      any children?" That calls for the Divination cards and if the rod
      settles on Yes, or Favorable, the next question could be: "How
      many?" That would means mixing the Numerology cards from 1 to 7
      and running along the entire row.<br>
      <br>
      The present game also includes three ways of "testing" the powers
      of the inner mind through the "psychomagnetic" attraction of the
      rod, all following the pattern of experiments which have been
      conducted in parapsychology laboratories at various colleges.<br>
      <br>
      The first is a "clairvoyance test." Literally interpreted as
      "clear seeing," this represents the psychic faculty of gaining an
      image or impression of an unseen object. To test this function,
      two or more cards of one set are mixed and placed face down on the
      circles of the board. The rod is used as described above to pick
      one card "psychomagnetically." If the individual has clairvoyant
      power, this seemingly random choice will be guided to the card
      that represents the subject or answer that is subconsciously
      sought.<br>
      <br>
      The next is the "precognition test." In this case, the cards are
      dealt face up, so that the individual is aware of each subject, or
      all possible answers. The procedure is the same, but in using the
      rod, a mood of complete impartiality is maintained so that
      apparently the rod alone picks out the card that represents the
      probable future event. If there is a precognitive power, the inner
      knowledge is the guiding force.<br>
      <br>
      The third is the "telepathic test." Worked with cards either face
      up or face down. Other people concentrate upon one of the cards,
      noting it by name or number if face up; while with face down
      cards, they merely choose a card according to its position in the
      row. The individual or consultant runs the rod back and forth in
      the usual fashion until it settles upon a card. One lucky hit does
      not necessarily indicate a telepathic ability of picking up other
      people's thoughts, but repeated successes that run well above the
      law of average may be significant.<br>
      <br>
      The "telepathic test" may be worked two ways. (1) In the presence
      of the people who are concentrating on the card; they deal them
      while the individual working the rod is out of the room. The
      individual returns and proceeds to use the rod. (2) With the
      people absent, thus making it a case of "remote telepathic
      control." They deal the cards while the individual is out; then
      they come from the room and the individual goes in, calling for
      them to return after the rod scores its hit. Either way, turns may
      be taken by different people, each acting as the telepathist, to
      see which member of the group can run up the biggest score of
      successful hits.<br>
      <br>
      Other questions and uses for the present game equipment will be
      apparent. It should be appreciated that the foregoing are
      exemplary rules for the present game which is for the purpose of
      providing fun and enjoyment.<br>

        <b>Dousing rod with stackable point extension tube - has hollow
          pyramid shaped chamber for test materials</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor: ANGELE JOSEF <br>
      <br>
      The dowsing rod has three mutually connected arms aligned at
      angles to each other by spring force. It gives a stronger reaction
      than conventional dowsing rods so that water dowsers with little
      experience can achieve good results. A tube (11,12) consisting of
      several sections fitting one inside the other fits over the point
      of the dowsing rod. Any number of sections can be added to the
      tube so as to vary the length as required. Test materials may be
      placed in or on the tube. The test materials may be placed in a
      pyramid shaped hollow body mounted on the end of the tube remote
      from the arms of the rod. The material is inserted into a chamber
      in the hollow body via a sealable opening.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a dowsing rod with two angled ZUW today
      directed resiliently interconnected legs.<br>
      <br>
      Divining rods used for locating the coming out of the ground or
      the air space radioactive emanations.<br>
      <br>
      The dowsing rods are also used for the detection of magnetic
      fields or magnetic DC slowly changing fields.<br>
      <br>
      The detection of so-called StÃ¶roder stimulus zones or underground
      water resources as well as other in the earth hidden minerals has
      long been known, and the nature and reactions of the divining rod
      for example, from "Physical and chemical investigations with a
      dowser as an indicator" (PhD., Dr. med ;, Joseph WÃ¼st, I. Reprint
      1979 special issue of Research Group for Geobiology e.V. is known
      self-published).<br>
      <br>
      The invention has for its object to provide a divining rod, in
      which the responses to known dowsing are increasingly noticeable,
      so that dowsers come with less experience to good results.<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved according to the invention starting from a
      divining rod of the type explained solved in that on the top of
      the dowsing rod, a tube is placed slidably.<br>
      <br>
      This makes it possible to change the length of the rods and thus
      adapted to the different radiations union, so that the response to
      each specific Rays much more pronounced than in a WÃ¼nachebute
      whose<br>
      Length is not changed.<br>
      <br>
      Through the tube, which can be pushed onto the top of the divining
      rod, the angle of the rod forming leg and thus the voltage of the
      divining rod is changed, which is also a possibility of difference
      adjustment Liche circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      To make the adjustment very well, may in further development of
      the invention the pipe from several plugged into one another<br>
      <br>
      Pipes made that in for changing the tube length of any Number can
      be plugged together.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, virtually all the radiations occur that require
      lengths for their accurate detection of different rods to track
      down in a safe manner.<br>
      The tube serves not only to change the rod length and Tension of
      the legs of the divining rod, but can also serve as a carrier for
      test materials, which can be arranged in development of the
      invention in or on the tube.<br>
      <br>
      To reinforce the dowsing reaction, it is particularly advantageous
      if the at the end of the legs of the divining rod end Tube a
      pyramid-shaped hollow body is removably mounted, as a result, the
      incident energy leads to better effect, ie the incident energy is
      amplified to the divining rod and the Transmitted carrier of
      divining.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, results in the formation of a pyramidal KÃ¶rpersan
      the top of divining higher magnetic forces.<br>
      <br>
      The measurement of the magnetic flow with the FÃ¶rster probe
      (magnetometer) gave a value of 1.0 Oe.<br>
      <br>
      The pyramid-shaped hollow body may define a closed space in
      development of the invention and having a closable insertion
      opening for test materials.<br>
      <br>
      This is advantageous because the caused by the pyramidal
      configuration of the hollow body reinforcement of the incident
      energy directly there learns their reinforcement where the test
      material, ie that material is housed, whose presence is to be
      found in the earth.<br>
      <br>
      This configuration results in a reinforced fabric radiation
      reaction and thus an enhanced Rods rash.<br>
      <br>
      As the respective test substance can be easily replaced by
      another, it is possible in connection with the rapidly changeable
      length of the divining rod to find an exact adaptation to the to
      be ascertained radiation, whereby the work of a dowser is
      substantially facilitated urnd- shortened time.<br>
      <br>
      A reinforcement of dowsing response to a particularly high mass is
      possible by a development of the invention, when starting designed
      by a divining rod with rotary handles the dowsing, is that one of
      the handles in an electrically conductive, but in relation to the
      legs electrically insulated by an insulator and that the having
      leg and handle connections for the poles of a DC power source.<br>
      <br>
      In this way it is possible to send a current through the existing
      of a magnetized steel wire rod and the body of dowsing, divining
      whereby the reactions are amplified far more than would be
      possible solely by adjustment of rod length.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, in this case the second handle with the rod is
      electrically connected.<br>
      <br>
      A particularly advantageous for practical use configuration
      results from the fact that the DC source is disposed in the handle
      and that one pole is connected to the handle directly and the
      other pole via a slip ring connection to the limb of dowsing.<br>
      <br>
      A lighter response of divining the energy afflicted radiation each
      incident is achieved in development of the invention that out as
      coil springs in known manner formed handles are surrounded with
      respect to the coil spring rotatable handle sleeve which consists
      of individual sections.<br>
      <br>
      In certain applications it may be advantageous when the individual
      sections are made of different materials.<br>
      <br>
      By This configuration is created not only a second rotation
      possibility, thereby preventing could that jammed the handle
      against the legs of the rod may, thus hindering the rash, but this
      way is also the possibility of the individual fingers of the
      handle holding hand different assign materials, which can be seen
      in certain types of radiation in terms of improved
      Ansprechreaktion.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that as the test materials not only such
      substances can be mounted in or on the dowsing, their occurrence
      is to be detected in the soil, but can also be included certain
      chemical substances to determine induced diseases interference to
      animals.<br>
      <br>
      An essential V'erbesserung not only in terms of enhanced
      susceptibility to existing radiation, but also in the possibility
      of different radiations differentiation is achieved by the
      invention in that at the divining at least one antenna can be
      mounted.<br>
      <br>
      Sub antenna is at spielsweiee a wire to be understood that
      consists of magnetized or nichtmagnetisiertem steel or other
      conductive material.<br>
      <br>
      The antenna is attached to the divining rod that it is
      conductively connected with this.<br>
      <br>
      In the arrangement of multiple antennas they may be arranged with
      equal or different length and of equal and different direction
      with respect to the divining-rod.<br>
      <br>
      In principle, two different arrangement possibilities arise,
      namely the antennas can be arranged to extend along the
      longitudinal axis of divining either like a crown of rays of
      divining protrude radially or substantially.<br>
      <br>
      Tests have shown that in the arrangement of four antennas that
      dowsing is particularly well suited for, identifying the Curry
      network, while the arrangement of two antennas offers particularly
      favorable conditions for the detection of magnetic fields.<br>
      <br>
      For the arrangement of running in the longitudinal direction of
      the rod antennas are suitable to the divining plugged pipe in a
      particularly favorable manner, since the antennas are simply
      inserted only into the pipe and clamped in this.<br>
      <br>
      When arrangement of radially extending antennas, it is expedient
      to attach a ring and the ring delay that is associated with the
      divining rod tube.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the type of radiation aufzusuchenden it may be
      advantageous to use the antennas with or without the pyramidal
      body.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is illustrated in the drawing, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Therein: <br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a longitudinal

      <br>
      According to FIG. 1 is the divining of two angularly mutually
      facing resiliently interconnected legs 1, which consist of a
      single magnetized steel wire whose ends 2 and 3 are polarized as
      north and south poles.<br>
      <br>
      The legs 1 are angled to form supports for handles again and wear
      this under a large angular range spirals 4, on which sleeves 14,
      15, 16, 17 and 18 to form a handle and more sleeves 19, 20 and 25
      to forming the other handle rotatably disposed.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, a double rotation possibility, because the spiral can
      turn on the one hand against the steel wire rod and the other
      hand, the aforementioned sleeves opposite the spiral.<br>
      <br>
      On the tip of the rod, a tube 12 and then a further tube 11 can be
      pushed, which carries a tip in the form of a pyramid. 5<br>
      <br>
      This pyramid defining a space 6, which is closed to the base of
      the pyramid by a bottom 7 which is provided with a plug for
      filling a test substance.<br>
      <br>
      An intermediate bottom 8, which is guided displaceably by means of
      a sleeve 9 on the pipe 11, serves to receive further test
      substance 8 between the bottom 7 and the intermediate bottom.<br>
      <br>
      This space is designated by 10.<br>
      <br>
      Since the sleeve 9 displaceably sits with a close fit on the tube
      11, it is possible to test materials having fixed shape, in the
      intermediate space 10 by displacement of the intermediate bottom 8
      to clamp against the bottom 7.<br>
      <br>
      With 13 of the area is called, in which the legs protrude from the
      pipe 12 and accept its spread up to today.<br>
      <br>

      depending on the depth of penetration of the legs 1 into the tube
      12, the voltage of the legs against each other is changeable.<br>
      <br>
      Within the one handle an electric battery 21 is provided and
      maintained by a VerschluBstÃ¼ck 22 which the sleeve 25 can be
      pushed in the manner of a cap, which is electrically conductive.<br>

      One of the two poles of the battery, which is indicated at 24, is
      the final piece and therefore with the touchable by the hand grip

      In this way it is possible that the current generated by the
      battery 21 through the body of the rod carrier flows to the second
      handle, the surface of which is made up of the sleeves 14 to 18,
      which communicates with the corresponding legs of the divining rod
      in electrically conductive connection.<br>

        <b>DEVICE FOR THE NEUTRALIZATION OF THE DOWSING-ROD RESPONSES
          CAUSED BY SO-CALLED TERRESTRIAL RAYS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor: EDE JOHANNES BRON &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The invention concerns a device for the neutralization of the
      dowsing-rod responses caused by so-called terrestrial rays,
      comprising a number of superimposed metal parts, of which a part
      which is dis-continuous as seen in vertical central cross-section
      is "bounded on the upper and the lower side by metal plates.<br>
      <br>
      In a known device of this kind two sets of plates extending in
      horizontal planes are located side by side at a horizontal
      distance, each set of plates incorporating a wire-shaped part
      which is formed by three small straight rods. The plates are
      square. Another known device of this kind has circular flat plates
      with a flat spiral part between them.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is to improve such known
      devices. This improvement is based on an understanding of how such
      a device operates and should operate. This understanding is
      largely of an intuitive nature and cannot be explained adequately
      by means of the normal generally accepted knowledge of electric
      and magnetic phenomena. Accordingly no attempt will be made in the
      present specification to give an explanation of the operation. A
      description will merely be given of the features which a device
      according to the invention should necessarily exhibit or
      preferably exhibits. In practice it has been found that good
      results are achieved upon application of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      A device according to the invention comprises a number of
      superimposed metal parts, all of which being placed with their
      centre in the same vertical axis, one part having the form of at
      least approximately a flat horizontal spiral and consisting of a
      metal or an alloy of metals of the iron, palladium, or platinum
      group or silver, cadmium, or gold, a flat plate lying on either
      side of said spiral, said plates consisting of a metal or an alloy
      of metals of the copper group, or tin, or lead, characterized in
      that in the center of these plates and spiral part a vertical
      rod-like metal part is positioned in electric contact with the
      said parts, having at a distance outside the adjacent plate at
      least two about horizontally extending metal parts. Metal groups
      are to be taken as groups from the periodical system.<br>
      <br>
      A device according to the invention can be used for many different
      purposes. There are possibilities of application in connection
      with the health of human beings and animals, in connection with
      the growth of plants, in connection with the con-10 dition of the
      soil, such as its structure and humidity, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Dependent on circumstances and on the required radius of action, a
      larger or a smaller device can be used.<br>
      <br>
      As compared with known devices as mentioned above the present
      device has, besides great simplicity, a much lower sensitivity to
      metal masses in the neighbourhood, and a low sensitivity to the
      direction in which the device is located.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will now be explained in more detail by reference to
      the annexed drawings, in which<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 1 is a vertical cross-section through a box containing 20
        a diviee according to the invention;</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Fig. 2 is a view and cross-section along the line II-II in
        Fig. 1.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <br>
      A wooden box 1 has a closed bottom 2 and a sliding lid 3.
      Gross-laths 4 are attached rigidly to the opposite ends of the
      bottom of the box and in the center. Located against the end sides
      of the box 1 immediately below the lid 3 is on each end a
      cross-lath 5 secured to the box. Wooden blocks 6 keep a wooden
      table 7 in place, clamped between the laths 4 and 5 as shown. The
      table 7 carries three vertical centering pins 8, likewise of wooÃ¢.
      30 Between these pins 8 and centered thereby is a set of metal
      parts, comprising two silver-plated copper plates 9 and 10Â»
      between which a spiral part 11 of chrome nickel steel or silver is
      present. In the heart of this spiral part there is a disc 12 of
      chrome nickel steel or silver. In the disc 12 there is an
      indentation 13, in which the beginning of the spiral part 11 fits
      with metallic contact. The radial outer end 14 of the spiral part
      11 is situated radially opposite the indentation 13 and is bent
      outwardly as shown. The spiral, part consists of material having a
      rectangular cross-section, as visible in Pig. 1, and 10 having the
      same height as the disc 12. Around the spiral part 11 is a
      circular member 15 of the same material and the same shape of
      cross-section as the spiral part 11 and of the same outer diameter
      as the plates 9 and 10. To both sides of the outer end 14 of the
      spiral part 11 this circular member 15 is open, the ends being
      bent radially outwardly so that the radially outer ends are closer
      to thÃ« center of the device than the outer end 14 of the spiral
      part. A small gap is left open between this circular member 15 and
      said outer end 14.<br>
      <br>
      On top of the plate 10 are two wooden laths 16 shown in dot 20 and
      dash lines in Figure 2 and drawn by bolts 17 towards the table 7,
      said bolts extending through suitable holes in the parts 7 and 16
      as shown. Thus the plates 9 and 10, the spiral part 11 and the
      circular part 15 are clamped together to form an immovable unity.
      The laths 16 could be replaced by one circular wooden disc.<br>
      <br>
      In the disc 12 and in the top plate 10 is a central bore, taking
      up a pin 18 being integral with a part 19 of rectangular loop
      shape, with wire-like circular cross-section and extending in a
      vertical central plane perpendicular to the horizontal line 30
      through the center of the device and the outer end 14 of the
      spiral part 11. The parts 18 and 19 are made of copper but the
      kind of metal for these parts is not so highly critical, if only
      they have a high electric conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in dot and dash lines in the drawings there could be
      other loop-shaped parts extending under mutually equal angles in a
      horizontal plane, e.g. under 60Â° as shown in Figure 2, also
      unitary with the pin 18 and also mutually connected in their upper
      part in the center above the pin 18. The outer diameter of the
      loop-shaped parts 19 is about the same as that of the plates 9 and
      10.<br>
      <br>
      In practice the device is positioned so that the protruding part
      14 of the spiral part 11 is directed to the north along the
      magnetic earth meridian.<br>
