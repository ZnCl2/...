        <p><b>by E. F. Lindsley</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Wally Minto's eyes twinkled. "Now that you've got your pictures
        of the serious stuff, I want to show you our latest engine. It's
        at least 85% effecient, never wears out, requires no fuel or
        maintenance, costs very little, and should have been invented
        100 years ago." </p>
      <p>I'd just finished shooting pictures of Minto's solar-powered,
        Freon engine/generator set (<i>P.S</i>., Feb. 1976) and I wasn't
        quite sure if he was kidding about this newest engine. Four used
        propane bottles were hose-clamped to the ends of two pieces of
        aluminum angle, each about four feet long. </p>
      <p>The angles crossed at 90° at the center and were mounted on a
        central hub like a skinny four-blade windmill with bottles to
        swing in the breeze. </p>
      <p>Each bottle was connected to its mate on the opposite end of
        the angle with steel brake-line tubing. Under the rig's support
        was a tank of the type used to locate leaks in an inner tube. </p>
      <p>While I gazed in disbelief, Wally explained how his incredible
        power wheel works (see diagram below). </p>
      <p>A few weeks later I again visited the Kinetics Lab. By then the
        propane bottles had evolved into 12 containers of steel pipe
        welded into a polygon. </p>
      <p>The principle remained the same. I watched as Wally opened the
        valve to let in a trickle of water from solar panels on the roof
        of his parking shed. The water temperature was 155° F. </p>
      <p>Almost imperceptibly, the wheel started to turn. The speed
        picked up a bit and I timed a revolution -- about one rpm. Minto
        noted my misgivings. </p>
      <p>"Try holding onto the shaft," he said. I grabbed the shaft
        firmly --- it was if I'd tried to stop some eerie, irresistible
        force: no sound, no evidence of power, just pure twist. </p>
      <p>"Picture one 200 feet in diameter," he said. This time my mind
        boggled. Such a rig might hoist the pyramids. </p>
      <p>Wally doesn't expect industrialized nations to scramble for his
        wheel, and he isn't selling anything. He's donating it as a
        "gift to the world" and expects it will be used in
        underdeveloped, energy short areas. </p>
      <p>For example, a practical 33 ft. diameter wheel running on a
        temperature difference of as little as 3.5° F and producing
        several horsepower could pump irrigation water, grind grain, or
        saw wood. The materials could be scrap pipe, and no machining or
        skills are needed to build it. </p>
      <p>Several low-boiling materials might be used, but propane or
        R-12 may be best. </p>
      <p>Minto estimates a slightly larger (40 ft.) wheel with 14 pairs
        of one-ft. by 4.5 ft. containers would provide 10,240 ft/lb of
        work per container as each 269 lb. of liquid responds to gravity
        through a 20 ft level arm. </p>
      <p>At only one rpm this is 8.69 hp; not spectacular, but low cost
        and capable of running steadily for generations. The slow
        rotational speed can be stepped up to whatever is needed, just
        as with the old-time waterwheels. </p>
      <p>No fuel would be needed in many cases. The temperature
        difference required between the liquid on the bottom and the top
        occurs naturally in many situations: water and air, light and
        shade, etc. </p>
      <p>Minto has outlined construction details in a two-sheet paper
        entitled "The Minto Wheel." There are NO restrictions on
        building or experimenting with the wheel. </p>

      <p>Low-boiling liquid, such as freon or propane, fills one bottle
        of each pair. The opposite bottle is empty and void of air. The
        liquid collects in the lower bottle, which is immersed in warm
        (solar-heated) water. </p>
      <p>Heat from the water (or a solar reflector, or any other source
        slightly warmer than the surrounding air) vaporizes the liquid
        and forces part of it up through the connecting tube and into
        the empty bottle on top. </p>
      <p>Gravity does the rest: </p>
      <p>The heavy bottle starts down; --- the lighter bottle floats up.
      </p>
      <p>As each pair shuttles its liquid mass back and forth, the whole
        thing turns and repeats the process endlessly. </p>

      <p>Our forefathers used waterwheel to produce power, power which
        changed man's way of life and increased productivity. Today,
        when we know that our supply of energy from fossil fuels
        (including uranium) is exhaustible, every consideration should
        be given to tapping renewable energy sources. </p>
      <p>Wallace Minto, a scientist internationally-known for his
        development of a pollution-free automobile engine, has developed
        a practical version of an engine that runs on small temperature
        gradients to produce useful power. Such small temperature
        gradients are plentiful almost everywhere on earth, or can
        easily be produced from solar energy. </p>
      <p>The engine consists simply of a wheel with a series of sealed
        containers fastened around its rim. Diametrically opposite pairs
        of containers are connected by tubes. A low-boiling liquid, like
        propane, butane, carbon dioxide or Freon is sealed into the
        bottom container and subjected to a very mild increase of
        temperature. This causes a part of the liquid to vaporize,
        producing a higher pressure on the surface of the remaining
        liquid. This pressure forces the liquid up the connecting pipe
        until it spills into the opposite container at the top of the
        wheel. </p>
      <p>This shift of mass causes the top container to become heavier
        while its opposite number at the bottom of the wheel becomes
        lighter, and the force of gravity causes the wheel to turn, in
        the same manner that water turns a water wheel. As the filled
        container nears the bottom of the wheel, it is in turn subjected
        to the influence of the heat source, and it then discharges its
        liquid into the original container which is now empty at the top
        of the wheel, having cooled as it traveled upward. This cycle is
        repeated indefinitely with no loss of the contents of the sealed
        chambers and the wheel keeps turning as long as there is an
        adequate temperature difference between its bottom and top.</p>

    <blockquote>No significant power can be produced from ordinary
      fluids that have relatively high boiling points, such as water or
      alcohol. Their vapor pressures are too low at temperatures near
      ambient. In addition, it takes too much heat energy to vaporize a
      pound of their liquid. However, today we have available liquids
      that vaporize to produce high differential pressures at very
      modest temperature differences. The use of these fluids is what
      makes the Minto wheel practical as a power source. Units of modest
      size could perform such tasks as pumping water for irrigation,
      grinding food grains and generating small amounts of machine power
      on a farm-by-farm basis. A temperature gradient of as little as
      two degrees Celsius (about 3½° F.) will drive a wheel ten meters
      (33 feet) in diameter. Such small temperature differences are
      abundant almost everywhere in nature: such as the temperature
      difference between water and cooler air, or even the difference
      between direct sunshine and shade.
      <p>The wheel turns relatively slowly, but produces enormous
        torque, or twisting effect on a shaft; this can be geared up
        through gears or belting to produce any speed desired at the
        final output shaft. </p>
      <p>The Minto wheel is simple and inexpensive to build and is
        virtually maintenance free. When constructed of suitable
        materials and supplied with heat, a single unit can keep
        grinding out power for generations. </p>
      <p>The wheel is simple to construct because no precision machine
        work is required. It is designed to be built from those
        materials most readily at hand in your community. The drawings
        herewith are intended to serve as a guide, or an example of such
        construction, but the exact dimensions given need not be
        followed closely. We suggest full exercise of your ingenuity in
        substituting parts available on most farms, from automobile
        junkyards, or your local refrigeration and air-conditioning
        serviceman. </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Certain basic considerations in the
          design of a wheel are:</font> </p>
      <p>1. The main body of the working liquid should be heated as
        little as possible. Side arm tubes, for example, could be used
        to heat and vaporize only that portion required to pressurize
        the chamber. </p>
      <p>2. The power output capability of the wheel depends upon the
        temperature differential available to drive it. </p>
      <p>3. Extended surfaces should be employed to facilitate heat
        transfer. </p>
      <p>4. Heat transfer to structural parts, particularly main
        container walls, should be minimized. Minimize the weight of the
        structural parts heated. </p>
      <p>5. Higher density liquids maximize horsepower output from a
        given wheel operating at a given RPM. </p>
      <p>6. Dual liquid fillings can be employed for special purposes.
        For example, using mercury as the shifting mass, powered by
        propane as the volatile fluid, tremendous torque can be
        generated with a relatively small diameter wheel. </p>
      <p>7. The choice of working fluid is governed by optimum
        compromise among these factors, at the temperature range to be
        used. </p>
      <p>Minimize: </p>
      <p>Cost </p>
      <p>Latent heat of vaporation of liquid </p>
      <p>Specific heat of fluid </p>
      <p>Viscosity of liquid </p>
      <p>Maximize: </p>
      <p>Vapor pressure </p>
      <p>Ratio of the specific volume of the vapor to that of the liquid
      </p>

        <p><b><font color="#000000">TANKS</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The tanks around the rim are the most difficult part, so they
        should be made first. They are conveniently fabricated from
        pipe, (such as aluminum irrigation pipe) by welding, brazing or
        soldering. If you do not have the facilities to make
        hermetically-sealed tanks, you can get assistance from that
        modern-day equivalent of the village blacksmith --- your local
        welding shop. Or you may be able to improvise from surplus
        oxygen flasks or vacuum reservoirs from an auto junk yard.
        Throwaway freon tanks in 25 pound sizes make excellent tanks
        that are often available very cheaply from your local
        refrigeration and air conditioning service-man. Aluminum is
        desirable because of its lightness and durability, but steel is
        easier to weld, braze or solder. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, welded joints are not essential. Carefully
        threaded and doped joints are satisfactory. If slip-on end caps
        are used, they may be applied with a good epoxy adhesive to form
        a hermetic seal. </p>
      <p>After each tank is fabricated with a short side tube, we
        recommend it be tested with compressed air, applying soapy water
        liberally to all joints to check for leaks. You can fit a tire
        valve stem to the side tube and use a tire pump or take it to
        your local service station. </p>
      <p>If you are concerned about the strength of your tanks, we
        recommend that you fill them with water before pressurizing. You
        can even pressurize them solely with water from your domestic
        supply. Since the compressibility of water is small at these
        modest pressures, this removes any danger from rupture on
        testing. </p>
      <p>The number of tanks around the rim is not crucial, except that
        it must be an even number. We recommend at least eight tanks, or
        four pairs to get a reasonably-smooth power flow. The larger the
        tank diameter, the greater the developed torque. But larger
        tanks have a smaller relative area for heat transfer. </p>
      <p>If you are using larger tanks, such as old freon containers, it
        is preferable to silver solder or braze on several copper
        U-bends to the outer side of the tanks. The volatile liquid can
        then flow into the copper tubes and vaporize in them to produce
        the pressure needed to force the bulk of the liquid up the
        radial tubes and into the opposite tank, Similarly, these tubes
        will enhance condensation of vapor in the top tank. </p>
      <p>If you are fabricating tanks from pipe, we recommend that you
        insert in each tank a rolled-up piece of corrugated aluminum
        sheet to make a multiplicity of small channels next to the tank
        wall, This will improve heat transfer and tend to vaporize the
        fluid next to the wall with less heating of the main liquid
        mass. </p>
      <p>Alternate ways to join the side arm tube to the tank: </p>
      <p>1. Purchase brass adapters which are threaded with standard ½
        inch Iron Pipe Thread on one end and ½ inch tubing compression
        fitting on the other end. Bore these out so that the ½ inch
        tubing slides all the way through. A thick walled tank may then
        be drilled and tapped to accept the ½ inch I.P. end, which is
        installed using Permatex or other good pipe dope. The side arm
        tube is slid into final position with its brass grommet and nut
        in place and tightened down. A little smear of Permatex on the
        tube before tightening will insure a leak-proof tube joint. </p>
      <p>2. A brass plug threaded for 1/2; inch or 3/4 male IPT may be
        drilled through to accept a short length of 1/2; inch copper
        tubing, which is then soft-soldered into proper position. The
        brass plug is installed in the tank wall as in #1 and the radial
        tube connected to the opposite tank by solder sweat fittings. </p>
      <p>3. If the tank has a thin wall, a short length of tubing may be
        soldered or brazed in position. If the tank is steel, use copper
        tubing and braze, silver solder or hard solder in place. If the
        tank is aluminum, use an aluminum tube and special aluminum
        solder to make the joint. You can also solder a copper tube
        through an aluminum tank using a special solder. These special
        self-fluxing aluminum solders are available from dealers listed
        in the appendix. Follow directions carefully and try soldering
        some scrap pieces until you get the knack of using these special
        alloys. <br>

      <p>4. Of course, a good Heliac welder can do a quick and secure
        job of fastening on the end caps and stub tubes. If you and your
        friends were going to make a number of wheels, you might
        negotiate a reasonable mass-production price at a well-equipped
        welding shop. </p>
      <p>5. If you are working with thin-walled tubing, the connecting
        tube may be brought through a thick end cap by threading in a
        street ell, or welding on an ell fitting. In that case, you may
        choose to use a fairly sturdy pipe as the crossover tube between
        tanks, which can also do double duty as a spoke of the wheel. <br>

    <blockquote>If you make the tanks from thin steel pipe (Schedule 20
      or 10), their fabrication should be well within the capabilities
      of an ordinary electric welding machine or a flame brazing torch.
      <p>It must be emphasized that all joints must be made with care to
        be permanently leakproof under pressure. If this is done, the
        Minto wheel can produce power for generations, since there is no
        way for its working fluid to escape. </p>
      <p>Once your tanks have been fabricated and tested, you have
        finished the hardest part. The next most important component is
        the central support hub and axle. </p>
      <p>We have shown how to construct the central support hub and axle
        on a bare-bones basis, using a short length of 3 inch pipe, some
        square steel plates and a home-made bearing. But here a little
        browsing at an auto junk yard can give inspiration to your
        ingenuity. A rear axle and differential housing provides an
        excellent bearing assembly, with the added advantage that the
        former drive shaft will run at higher RPM than the wheel mounted
        on the axle. Of course, you will have to stop the other axle
        from turning --- or mount another Minto wheel on it to double
        the power output at the drive shaft. (Make sure you mount them
        so both turn the same way.) Also remember that the lubricating
        oil will run out of some differentials unless the drive shaft is
        horizontal. </p>
      <p>A pair of old front wheel suspensions, complete with steel

      <p>The pillow-blocks may be of wood, jigsawed, rasped or carved to
        a reasonable fit with the pipe axle. It is preferable, but not

        pour molten babbit, plumber's solder or similar soft metal in a
        wooden </p>
      <p>form to a level half way up the diameter of the axle, to make a
        long-lasting bearing. After pouring, remove the axle from the

        Occasional greasing will let it run for decades, especially if
        you protect the axle from weather by tacking a piece of old tire
        or tube over the bearing-axle junctions. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>We have shown the spokes made from aluminum angles, since these
        are light and durable. However, any other material or shape of
        adequate strength will do. Aluminum channel, pipe or tubing is
        fine, or even steel pipes will suffice at a cost of added
        maintenance to retard rusting. Heavy walled plastic water pipe
        will give excellent durability, but the number of spokes should
        be doubled to compensate for the lesser rigidity. </p>
      <p>The blueprints show a minimum number of spokes to minimize
        labor. You may find it desirable to add cross bracing to these,
        particularly if you build a larger wheel or use heavier tanks. </p>
      <p>A taut lacing of wire or light cable, in the manner of the
        spokes on a bicycle wheel, will also improve rigidity. </p>

      <p>The support stand is shown as made from ordinary two by four

        <p><b><font color="#000000">POWER TAKE OFF</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Since there are so many uses for power, we can only give some
        general guidelines and a few illustrations. These facts should
        be kept in mind: The Minto wheel likes to work; like its
        ancestor, the water wheel, it is a high-torque, low-speed
        mechanism. It operates most efficiently just below its maximum
        torque-capability. Of course, its output can be converted to
        higher RPM by gears, chains, and sprockets, cable or rope
        drives, belts and sheaves, etc. But, it is most effective at
        jobs which use high torque at low speed, such as irrigation or
        grinding grain. </p>
      <p>1. Always remember that horsepower is Proportional to the
        product of torque times RPM. A given wheel, operating across a
        given temperature gradient, will provide a particular maximum
        horsepower when fully loaded. If loaded less than that maximum,
        it will provide the output needed to drive its given load. It is
        self-regulating up to its maximum or stall torque. </p>
      <p>2. The power take-off drive train should be designed to match
        your power requirements at the RPM of the final driven device.
        If you are pumping water, a low speed piston or well pump is
        easily driven with a simple crank arm fixed to the axle of the
        wheel. Two or more pistons have a smoother demand for power, and
        a wheel will more efficiently drive them if they are phased
        oppositely. </p>
      <p>The wheel can easily drive a drum which hoists an endless
        series of pails to lift water from a well. Similarly, you can
        drive an air-compressor, such as an old piston refrigeration
        compressor or an air-conditioning compressor from a junked
        automobile (Ford type is best). The compressed air can be stored
        in a tank to drive any air motor to do anything. </p>
      <p>You can pump water uphill into a pond or other reservoir and
        use this stored power to drive a small Pelton wheel to produce
        power on demand. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="img2.jpg" height="198" width="311"></p>
      </center>
      <p>3. If you require a higher RPM in a directly driven device, it
        should be realized that ordinary V-belts and sheaves can not
        transmit the high torque of a Minto wheel, at least in the
        primary stages of gearing up to higher RPM. </p>
      <p>For the first and possibly second stage of speed
        multiplication, use sprockets and motorcycle chain, or cable or
        rope drives, or gearing. </p>
      <p>Here, mounting the wheel on an old automotive differential is
        advantageous, since the output will be geared up at least 3 to
        1, depending upon the assembly chosen. If the original
        differential drive shaft is coupled to an automotive
        transmission (manual type) a further step up in speed will be
        obtained, along with the versatility of a variable speed output.
        After going through these speed multiplication gear stages,
        ordinary V-belts and sheaves should handle the probable torque
        demands of later higher-speed power requirements. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you choose the simple axle and sleave
        bearing mounting, you can easily convert an old steel auto-wheel
        to a drive sprocket. Just weld or bolt studs on the rim,
        carefully spaced to coincide with the holes in the sprocket
        chain to be used. You do not need a stud per hole: eight or ten
        around the rim is usually adequate. But they must be set on a
        circumference of the wheel that is an integral multiple of the
        distance between adjacent holes in the chain. </p>
      <p>A convenient method is to use bicycle sprockets and chain,
        fastening the pedal sprocket to the wheel axle and the small
        sprocket to a pulley shaft. For higher torque, use two or three
        bicycle sprockets and chains working in parallel. Or use the
        stronger sprockets and chain from a motorcycle. Another
        alternative is to fasten the output end of an old car
        transmission (manual type) to the wheel axle. <br>

        <p><b><font color="#000000">FILLING THE WHEEL WITH FLUID</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Many fluids are available for this purpose. Your choice will
        depend primarily upon a trade-off between cost and efficiency,
        as well as the temperature gradients available to you. The
        man-made fluids, represented by the freon family, have
        relatively high liquid densities and very low heats of
        vaporization. Therefore, they are most efficient as working
        fluids, producing the most horsepower for a given design of
        wheel. However, they are more expensive than the
        readily-available hydrocarbons, like butane, or liquified
        "bottled-gas". </p>
      <p>A third class of fluids consists of solutions of one substance
        in another, such as carbon dioxide dissolved in washing soda
        solution (essentially "club soda"), or propane dissolved in
        kerosene. We recommend that the solution type of fluid be used
        only by more sophisticated constructors who have the expertise
        to deal with the more complex factors involved in desorption and
        re-sorption. However, these can yield excellent efficiencies
        because the heat of solution is lower than the heat of
        vaporization. <br>

      </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font color="#000000">FILLING THE SYSTEM</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The fluid is put into each pair of tanks by means of a fill
        valve on each connecting tube. Of course, the fill valve can be
        on one tank of each pair. You can conveniently improvise a fill
        valve with the valve from a bicycle tube or a metal valve stem
        from an automotive inner tube. Other choices are to use fill
        valves available at an air-conditioning supply store, or the
        valves that come on freon tanks. The latter is a logical choice
        if you use the one-way freon tanks available from your local air
        conditioning shop. </p>
      <p>In filling the tanks, it is very desirable to remove as much
        air as possible from each pair before filling and sealing. </p>
      <p>The presence of air reduces the pressure differential
        attainable at a given temperature gradient, cutting down the
        power output. </p>
      <p>There are a number of ways to remove most of the air, depending
        upon what equipment is available to you - or even without
        equipment. </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Some Choices are:</font> </p>
      <p>1. Your refrigeration service man usually has an old compressor
        which will pull a decent vacuum through the fill valve. </p>
      <p>2. An automotive air conditioning compressor from a junk yard
        can be directly-driven by an electric motor to evacuate the
        tanks. </p>
      <p>3. You can obtain a "water aspirator" from a chemical supply
        house (or drug store) for several dollars which will pull a
        decent vacuum when hooked up to a garden hose, even at low
        domestic water pressure. </p>
      <p>4. If you have no source of vacuum, merely admit some of the
        working fluid of your choice into the system through the fill
        valve, wait a few minutes for mixing, turning the wheel by hand,
        then vent the mixed gases. Three or four repetitions of this
        flushing will adequately remove air from the system. If you
        choose to fill the tanks with freon, we suggest you flush with
        "bottled gas", since that is cheape<sub>r </sub>and entirely
        compatible with the freon. </p>
      <p>When most of the air is removed from the system, each pair of
        tanks is filled With enough working fluid to fill one tank with
        liquid and its opposite with vapor. Since the exact amounts are
        not critical, simple measurement of the tank dimensions will
        enable you to calculate the volumes of the tank. The tables in
        the appendix will allow you to estimate the weight of fluid to
        be put in the fill tube. </p>
      <p>The most direct way to determine the weight of fluid placed in
        each pair of tanks is to weigh the supply tank. If the supply
        tank is connected to the fill valve with a flexible tube, you
        can continuously monitor its weight on a bathroom scale. </p>
      <p>If that is not readily available, make a simple equal-arm
        balance from a length of lumber and hang the supply tank on one
        end and a bucket on the other. Fill the bucket with water until
        balance is achieved, then remove from the bucket a measured
        amount of water equal to the weight of fluid you wish to put in.
        A pint is a pound and a liter is a kilogram. The beam will
        balance again when the correct weight of working fluid has
        entered the system. </p>
      <p>If you do not have a bucket big enough, hang the supply
        cylinder at some measured shorter distance from the pivot point
        and use the appropriate factor in determining the amount of
        water to be removed. <br>

      <center><b><font color="#000000">DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS</font></b></center>
      <p>The Minto Wheel is designed to utilize relatively small
        temperature gradients to produce useful mechanical energy. A hot
        spring or solar heated water will drive it nicely. Be very
        careful to chose a liquid which will not produce a pressure too
        high for your tank walls. Do not try for very high temperature
        differences unless you are familiar with analysis of mechanical
        strength of the tanks. We advise against using high-temperature
        heat sources (such as flames) to drive the system, unless you
        are qualified to make the required analyses of stresses. <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font color="#000000">TANK SIZE</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Do not be too ambitious in the size of tanks used. As the
        diameter of the tank is increased, its liquid capacity goes up
        as the square of the diameter, but the area available for heat
        transfer increases only linearly with the diameter. Heat
        transfer determines the op wer output. A wheel with small tanks
        will develop less torque, but will run faster. Remember that the
        power output is proportionate to torque times RPM. </p>
      <p>Usually, tanks with diameters of from three to eight inches are
        most satisfactory. The length of the tank can be varied to suit
        the diameter of the wheel. Any variation in the length of the
        tank varies the volume and area in the same ratio. A long slim
        tank is better than a short fat one. </p>
      <p>We recommend that at least eight tanks per wheel be used, but
        more than sixteen becomes somewhat complicated by the large
        number of crossover tubes threading through the hub area. Layout
        is simplified by using an even number of pairs, rather than an
        odd number of pairs. In other words, use eight, twelve or
        sixteen tanks (four, six or eight pairs) rather than ten or
        fourteen tanks (five or seven pairs). <br>
      </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font color="#000000">CALCULATIONS</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>To determine the weight of fluid needed to fill your chosen
        tanks: If they are cylinders, take the inside diameter of the
        tank and multiply it by itself, then multiply the product by
        0.7854 to get the cross-sectional area. Multiply this number by
        the length of the tank to get its volume. Be sure that all
        measurements are made in the same units. If measured in inches,
        the result will be in cubic inches. If in centimeters, the
        result will be in cc. or ml. The tables in the appendix are
        given in English units of pounds per cubic foot, so your cubic
        inch result should be divided by 1728 to read out in cubic feet.
        Our metric friends only need to move the decimal point three
        places to the left to get liters, or six places to get cubic
        meters. </p>
      <p>Remember that the total weight of fluid put into each pair of
        evacuated tanks should be equal to one tankful of liquid plus
        one tankful of vapor, at the probable operating temperature. The
        tables in the appendix will supply the necessary data to
        calculate the desired weiqht from the known volume of your
        tanks. This is not a critical matter but leads to maximum
        efficiency of operation. It is similarly desirable, but not
        essential, to have an equal weight of fluid in every pair of
        tanks on the wheel. </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Operation of the wheel:</font> </p>
      <p>The power output of the wheel is proportionate to the rate at
        which heat is transferred into the liquid at the bottom and out
        of the vapor at the top, </p>
      <p>For a given temperature difference, a hot water bath will
        transfer heat to the bottom tanks at a rate about forty times
        faster than hot air will. </p>
      <p>So, we recommend that you use hot water to heat the bottom
        tanks, when feasible. The water may be heated by solar
        radiation, as with a solar collector below the bath level to
        heat it by convection. If you have a geothermal spring, your
        worries are over, and it need be only twenty degrees or so
        warmer than the air to give a reasonable power output. </p>
      <p>Similarly, if you are using the wheel to pump water, arrange to
        have a few drops dripping on the top of the wheel to cool the
        upper tanks by evaporation. This increases the temperature
        difference across the wheel and increases power output. Even if
        you have no cool water, a bucket with a wick siphon dripping on
        the top of the wheel will help greatly, especially in hot, dry
        climates. </p>
      <p>We have mentioned that the wheel likes to work and should be
        loaded to maximum torque for best efficiency. The optimum speed
        is easily determined for your particular wheel and heat source
        by putting into one of the crossover lines a small "bulls eye"
        type sight glass. These are available at your local air
        conditioning service man. Only one need be built into one
        cross-over line if all your tanks are similar.</p>

    <blockquote>The load should be adjusted so that liquid <u>starts </u>to
spurt



      up the cross-over line when the bottom tank of that pair is
      horizontal. Bubbles of vapor should start to show in the sight
      glass as the tank trailing behind this one becomes horizontal. By
      adjusting the load on the power take off, and the depth of the
      water bath, this ideal may be approached.
      <p><font color="#000000">Power output of the wheel:</font> </p>
      <p>Of course, you can just build a wheel and load it until it is
        working at maximum efficiency, then see whether it will do the
        job you hoped it would. But it is not difficult to calculate how
        much power it should turn out. The basic rules were worked out
        by Lazare Carnot (1753-1823) for water wheels, the major prime
        movers of his day, which were pure gravity engines. It is
        interesting that his son, Sadi Carnot, (1796-1832) is the author
        of the Carnot Theoreum of modern thermodynamics. Sadi took his
        father's formulae for power development by water wheels and
        converted it to the potential power output of heat engines. Sadi
        likened the "caloric fluid" to water, and the temperature
        through which it dropped to the height through which the water
        dropped. Today, we know that Lazare Carnot was correct, since
        the amount of water coming out the bottom of a waterwheel is the
        same as the amount of water going into the top. We also know
        that the amount of heat coming out of a heat engine is less than
        the amount of heat going into it. But in Sadi Carnot's day, the
        efficiency of steam engines was so low that he could not detect
        the difference between the "caloric fluid" going into the engine
        and the amount coming out. So he incorrectly applied his
        father's water wheel formulas to heat engines in 1824. </p>
      <p>I do not wish to digress with this historical diversion, but it
        should be realized that this wheel is a synthesis of both the
        Carnots, father and son. It is a gravity engine operating on the
        principles of the water wheel, driven by a temperature gradient.
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Back to our calculations:</font> </p>
      <p>If a weight of any substance falls through a vertical distance,
        its potential energy may be converted into kinetic energy. If
        one pound of weight falls one foot, it can develop one
        foot-pound of energy. Power is <u>the rate </u>of delivery of
        energy. It has been established that one horsepower is the
        equivalent of delivering 33,000 foot-pounds of energy per
        minute. Or 4500 kilogram-meters per minute. </p>
      <p>To calculate the horsepower output of your wheel then, it is
        only necessary to know its diameter, and the weight of liquid
        transferred from bottom to the top tank each minute. The product
        of these two, divided by 33,000 will give you the horsepower.
        This is Lazare Carnot, upside down. </p>
      <p>Well, its easy enough to measure the diameter of the wheel, but
        how much weight will transfer per minute? Here is where <u>Sadi
        </u>Carnot's theorem takes over. The greater the temperature
        difference, the higher the efficiency. Put Lazare and Sadi
        together and you get a "snowball effect". </p>
      <p>Let's state it this way: The greater the temperature difference
        between the bottom and top of the wheel, the greater is the
        power output <u>and </u>efficiency of conversion of heat to
        power. </p>
      <p>Let us get back to calculating <u>how much </u>weight will be
        transferred per minute. </p>
      <p>To determine this, let us look at what happens. In the bottom
        tank, we must vaporize a quantity of liquid to fill that tank
        with vapor. The vapor displaces almost a tankful of liquid into
        the upper tank. You already know the volume of the tank, so you
        must calculate the <u>weight </u>of vapor it takes to fill it,
        at your probable operating temperature. This number you can get
        from the tables given herein. Then you read out, on the same
        line, the heat of vaporization per unit weight. This gives you
        the amount of heat you have to put into the bottom tank to empty
        it. {Pounds of vapor times heat of vaporization per pound.} </p>
      <p>Now you know how much heat (measured in British Thermal Units,
        BTU's) you have to put into the tank to empty it and drive the
        liquid into the top tank. </p>
      <p>But power depends upon the <u>rate </u>of heat flow. Knowing
        how many BTU's have to flow into the tank, you must next figure
        out the <u>rate </u>of heat flow. The heat flow <u>rate </u>depends


        upon the temperature difference between the water bath and the
        contents of the tank. For each degree Fahrenheit of temperatur<sup>e
        </sup>difference between the water bath and the working fluid in
        the tank, about 5 BTU's will flow per minute per square foot of
        tank wall area. </p>
      <p>If you are not familiar with thermodynamic calculations, this
        may seem like a big chunk to swallow. But if we cut it up into
        little pieces, it is not hard to digest. And you would really
        like to make a reasonable prediction of what your wheel can turn
        out~ So let's take an example, step by step, to illustrate the
        principles: </p>
      <p>Let us say that we make the tanks from three lengths of
        aluminum irrigation pipe of four inch diameter. If we cut each
        length into five foot sections, we will get about four tanks per
        piece of pipe, giving 12 tanks for our wheel. If the wheel is
        somewhat over 60 feet in circumference, it will be about 20 feet
        in diameter. Those are the basic facts. </p>
      <p>We can calculate that each tank has a heat transfer area of 4 x
        3 14 ( ) square inches per inch of length, multiplied by 60
        inches of length gives about 754 square inches. Since there are
        144 square inches in a square foot, the 754 square inches
        converts to 5.24 square feet per tank, We will ignore the area
        of the end caps as a little "fudge factor" in our favor, </p>
      <p>Now we put in the 5 BTU per minute per square foot per degree
        Fahrenheit. So we know each tank can transfer 5 times 5.24 or
        about 26 BTU's per minute for each degree temperature difference
        between its contents and the water bath. </p>
      <p>Next we will assume the ideal case, where we heat up and
        vaporize only the weight of fluid required to fill the tank
        volume. </p>
      <p>We can calculate that the volume of one tank is: </p>
      <p>4" x 4" x 0.7854 x 60" = 754 cubic inches </p>
      <p>or 754/1728 = 0.436 cubic feet </p>
      <p>If we are using freon-12 as our working fluid, and pick a
        reasonable intermediate temperature of l00° F, reference to the
        tables in the appendix show that its vapor has a density of
        3.135 lbs/cu. ft. at that temperature. Therefore the weight of
        F-12 that has to be vaporized to displace the liquid in the
        lower tank is: </p>
      <center>
        <p>0.436 x 3.135 lbs = 1.37 lbs.</p>
      </center>
      <p>From the same table on the same line, we see that it takes
        57.46 BTU to vaporize one pound, so the amount of heat to be
        transferred into the tank is: </p>
      <center>
        <p>1.37 lbs x 57.46 BTU = 78.54 BTU</p>
      </center>
      <p>How much mass is transferred? Well, we started with a tankful
        of liquid. Our tables tell us that liquid F-12 at 100° F weighs
        80.11 lbs per cubic foot, and we know that a tank holds 0.436 cu
        ft. </p>
      <center>
        <p>80.11 x 0.436 34.93 lbs per tank</p>
      </center>
      <p>Of course, we are going to convert 1.37 lbs of the liquid into
        vapor, so the net transfer of liquid will be: </p>
      <p>34.93 - 1.37 : 33.56 lbs </p>
      <p>Since our wheel is about 20 feet in diameter, each tankful will
        provide nearly: </p>
      <p>33.56 x 20' = 671 foot pounds of energy </p>
      <p>In our example, twelve tanks will empty per revolution; we will
        get: </p>
      <p>12 x 671 = 8050 ft lbs/revolution </p>
      <p>If this work was used for hoisting water with an endless bucket
        chain, we can readily calculate that the 8000 ft. lbs of work
        per revolution is equal to that required to raise 95 gallons of
        water ten feet for each revolution of the wheel. In practice,
        somewhat less would be raised because of friction and other
        losses, but we are merely trying to approximate the magnitude of
        the useful work to be realized from the conditions of this
        example. </p>
      <p>Let us continue by calculating how many revolutions <u>per
          minute </u>would be expected. </p>
      <p>We said earlier that the <u>rate </u>of doing work is a
        function of the rate of heat flow. The rate of heat flow is
        governed by the area and the temperature difference. In our
        example, the tanks have an area of 5.24 square feet and a heat
        transfer coefficient of about 5 BTU per minute per square foot,
        so each tank will transfer 26 BTU per minute per degree
        Fahrenheit difference from the water bath. If the bath has water
        heated by solar panels, it might easily have an average
        temperature of 140° F, or 40°more than the tank. </p>
      <p>So, our heat flow rate would be: </p>
      <p>40 x 26 BTU = 1040 BTU/min/tank </p>
      <p>We have already calculated that, under ideal conditions, it
        takes 78.54 BTU to empty the tank. Therefore a tank ideally
        should empty in: </p>
      <p>78.54/1040 = 0.0755 min or 4.5 seconds </p>
      <p>Since there are twelve tanks on the wheel, it would ideally
        make about one revolution per minute and hoist 95 gallons of
        water per minute through ten feet. </p>
      <p>Remember that this is a theoretical calculation and your wheel
        will produce work at a somewhat lesser rate than the
        theoretical. If your specific embodiment produces half the
        theoretical work output, it would be equivalent to hoisting a 50
        gallon drum of water up ten feet every minute. This is
        considerably more work than a man can perform on a sustained
        basis. </p>
      <p>The wheel does not produce a high RPM, high power intensity
        output. If you have need for high intensity output, such as
        driving an electrical generator, then consider another
        innovative approach. Like the Minto wheel, this is also a
        gravity engine driven by a thermal gradient. But a different
        sequence of actions occur. <br>

      </center>
      <p>This prime mover is useful in more special circumstances. It
        uses a moderately-high temperature gradient (achieving greater
        Carnot efficiency) and a substantial difference of elevation,
        such as a mountain or high building. The basic principle
        involves the vaporization of a low-boiling liquid at modest
        pressure, such as a hot spring can produce. The vapor flows
        upward through a well-insulated pipe to some higher elevation,
        doing work against gravity. At the highest point it flows into
        an air-cooled condenser, wherein it gives up its heat and
        reverts to liquid form. The liquid flows back downhill through a
        pipe to produce a substantial hydrostatic head. The high
        pressure liquid drives an hydraulic motor. The exhaust of the
        motor flows into the vaporizer to close the cycle. The example
        gives details for one set of circumstances. </p>
      <p>This form of prime-mover requires some precision-built
        machinery in the hydraulic motor. But it has a greater intensity
        of power output. (High torque at high RPM) Nonetheless, the
        components are durable and not expensive. If the necessary
        sources of altitude and heat are available, it has a very high
        cost effectiveness and excellent durability. Like the wheel,
        once built, it can turn out power for generations to come
        without consuming irreplaceable fuels. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>A fluorocarbon compound possessing a low-specific heat and a
        low-latent heat of vaporization is forced in the liquid state
        through a heat exchanger and heated to within 50 F of, but not
        exceeding its critical temperature, while being maintained at a
        pressure exceeding its vapor pressure, to produce a liquid
        containing vaporous nuclei which is then injected through a
        nozzle or other pressure-reducing device tangentially into an
        expansion chamber, which chamber is at a pressure below the
        liquids vapor pressure, whereby a portion of the liquid
        evaporates and separates from the remaining liquid. The vapor
        fraction is withdrawn from the chamber to drive a vapor engine,
        the engines exhaust vapor is condensed to a liquid which is
        then raised in pressure and mixed with the liquid fraction from
        the separation chamber and recirculated through the heat
        exchanger. </p>
      <p><b>Background of the Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention is directed generally to improvements
        relating to the thermodynamic cycle and it relates particularly
        to an improved method and apparatus for converting heat into
        motive power. </p>
      <p>The use of steam as a drive medium or working fluid in vapor
        driven engines possesses important drawbacks and disadvantages.
        Among these disadvantages are susceptibility to freezing, the
        high weight-to-power ratios and the low maximum achievable
        efficiency, the latter being due to the high heat of
        vaporization of the water and the consequent high energy losses
        in the condenser. The use of other working fluids in place of
        steam as the drive medium overcomes many of the drawbacks
        accompanying the use of steam. Many of the fluorinated carbon
        compounds, particularly the fluorinated carbon compounds such as
        trichloromonofluormethane (R-11) and other of the fluorocarbons
        possess highly desirable properties and characteristics as drive
        fluids. They have low heats of vaporization so the condenser
        energy losses are low and their pressure-enthalpy
        characteristics are highly desirable. </p>
      <p>However, the use of fluorinated carbon compounds is accompanied
        by important practical drawbacks when embodied in the
        conventional cycles. These compounds are subject to
        decomposition on being heated to excessive temperatures, have
        small enthalpies, and under conventional conditions possess low
        heat transfer properties. Consequently under conventional
        conditions accompanying the heating and vaporization of these
        fluorinated compounds attendant to their use as working fluids,
        localized heating or hot spots occur which promote and
        accelerate their decomposition. Moreover, the size of the
        boilers and heat exchange units are large relative to their heat
        transfer capacity when employed with the fluorinated compounds,
        and the conventional heating and vaporizing procedures and
        apparatus otherwise leave much to be desired. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of the Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is a principal object of the present invention to provide an
        improved method and apparatus for the conversion of heat into
        motive power. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide an
        improved method and apparatus for producing a high-pressure
        vapor. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide an
        improved method and apparatus for the production of
        high-pressure vapors of condensable fluorinated compounds in
        which any heat decomposition of these compounds is eliminated. </p>
      <p>A further object of the present invention is to provide an
        improved method and apparatus of the above nature characterized
        by their efficiency, reliability and versatility and the
        compactness, ruggedness and adaptability of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>The above and other objects of the present invention will
        become apparent from a reading of the following description
        taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawing which
        illustrates a preferred embodiment thereof. </p>
      <p>In a sense the present invention contemplates the provision of
        a method and apparatus for the production of a pressurized vapor
        from a liquid which vapor is employed as the drive medium in a
        vapor engine wherein the liquid is pumped through a heat
        exchange and is there heated to a temperature below its critical
        vapor pressure so that the liquid phase is maintained in the
        heat exchange unit, the heated liquid being discharged into an
        expansion chamber at a pressure below its corresponding vapor
        pressure to vaporize a fraction of the injected heated liquid.
        The vapor and liquid fractions are separated in the chamber, the
        liquid fraction being returned to the heat exchange unit and the
        vapor fraction being used to drive a vapor engine, the expanded
        vapor output of which is condensed and the condensate returned
        to the heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>Advantageously, the working fluid is a low boiling point
        fluorocarbon compound having a low heat of vaporization,
        preferably a boiling point at atmospheric pressure of [ ? ]° F.,
        to 250° F., and a heat of vaporization of 20 to 300 BTU per
        pound at atmospheric pressure. Examples of highly suitable
        liquids are R-11, R-113, R-114, R-115, R-216, perfluoro cyclic
        ethers and amines, and R-21. </p>
      <p>The temperature and pressure of the liquid in the heat exchange
        unit is advantageously such that the liquid is in a nucleated
        state, that it, the pressure and temperature is such that a
        portion of the fluid is present in the form of minute vaporous
        nuclei but is characterized by the absence of any formation of
        bubbles of significant dimensions. The heat transfer rate to a
        liquid is found to be highest when it is in such a state of
        nucleated boiling, however, the rate of heat transfer from the
        wall to the fluid drops sharply if conditions are such that
        bubble formation occurs, and furthermore, there is a great
        danger of boiler tube burnout in the event that heat transfer
        from the tube wall to the heated fluid drops and the tube is not
        adequately cooled thereby. Moreover, the above conditions are
        highly conducive to the local overheating of the fluid with the
        resulting decomposition thereof. The system described herein
        obviates these difficulties and improves the efficiency of heat
        transfer, thereby substantially reducing the physical size of
        the vaporizer. </p>
      <p>The heat exchange unit conduits are advantageously of such
        design and dimensions and the flow rate of the liquid
        therethrough are such as to produce turbulent flow in the heat
        exchange conduits. In addition, the surface-to-volume ratio of
        the heat exchange conduits should be such as to effect a
        temperature gradient between the external heating fluid or hot
        gases and the conduit wall far greater than between the conduit
        wall and the heated liquid. </p>
      <p>Advantageously, the expansion chamber separating receiver is of
        cylindrical shape with a depending conical bottom wall, the
        heated liquid being injected into the chamber through a
        tangential nozzle to form a vortex in the chamber, the vapor
        fraction being obtained through a coaxial nozzle conduit in the
        top of the chamber and the liquid fraction being drawn from the
        bottom of the chamber. </p>
      <p>In order to increase the entrance velocity and produce a
        pressure differential, the minimum cross-sectional area of the
        tangential nozzle leading into the cylindrical expansion chamber
        is advantageously less than, and preferably less than half of,
        that of the conduit leading from the heat exchanger to the
        nozzle. The diameter of the expansion chamber is advantageously
        3 to 10 times that of the conduit leading to the nozzle and the
        height of the chamber is advantageously 4 to 12 times the
        conduit diameter, and the height of the depending conical
        section is preferably between 2 and 5 times the conduit
        diameter. The chamber coaxial vapor outlet conduit projects into
        the chamber a distance of one to 4 times and is of a diameter of
        one to 4 times the diameter of the conduit leading to the
        nozzle. </p>
      <p>The vortex produced in the chamber causes a rapid separation of
        the liquid and gaseous fractions with minimal entrainment each
        of the other. Further, centrifugal action produces a pressure
        gradient across the radius of the vessel so that any small
        droplets of liquid entrained in the gas tend to evaporate. </p>
      <p>The subject method and apparatus produces a pressurized vapor
        from a low boiling point fluorocarbon in a highly efficient and
        reliable manner with the obviation of any decomposition or
        deterioration of the fluorocarbon, and the apparatus is compact,
        simple and rugged. </p>

      <p><b>Brief Description of Preferred Embodiment ~</b> </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawing which illustrates preferred
        embodiment to the present invention, the reference numeral 10
        generally designates the improved heat to motive power
        conversion system which includes a heating unit 11, a vapor
        separator 12, a vapor engine 13, a condenser 14, a feed pump 15,
        and a burner 16 in a typical operation the low boiling fluid and
        would be circulated by pump 17 through the heat exchanger 18
        which typically would be comprised f a multiplicity of coiled
        pipes constructed of a material that is heat and corrosion
        resistant. The heated fluid would then pass through a pressure
        reducing valve 19, which is optional, and thence through nozzle
        20 into the vapor separator unit 12. The liquid portion of the
        heated fluid would then return via conduit 21 and reservoir 22
        to the pump 17 for recirculation, whereas, the vapor portion of
        the heated fluid would exit separator via conduit 23, pass to
        the engine 13 through throttle valve 24 which controls the
        engine 13. Exhaust from engine 13 would pass via conduit 25 into
        an injector 26. Within the injector 26 the exhaust vapor from
        the engine thereby raising the pressure in condenser 14 and
        providing a much greater surface for the vapor to condense upon,
        as well as a higher pressure within the condenser, thereby
        making the heat transfer much more efficient. A portion of the
        liquid from pump 15 travels via check valve 29 back into the
        heat exchanger vapor separation system 11, 12. Fuel supplied to
        the burner 16 is controlled via valve 32 which, in turn, is
        actuated by network 33 of known construction. Network 33 is
        controlled in turn by the sensor 30, which is responsive to the
        temperature of the heated fluid within the heat exchanger coils
        and also to the sensor 31, which is responsive to the vapor
        pressure inside the vapor separator 12. Temperature sensor 30 is
        preset to turn down the duel supply or turn it off entirely if
        the temperature exceeds a preset value below the critical
        temperature of the working fluid. Pressure sensor 31 is arranged
        so as to reduce or cut off the fuel supply via network 33 if the
        pressure exceeds the preset value. </p>
      <p>The expansion chamber and vapor liquid separator 12 includes a
        vertical cylindrical wall 40 provided with a depending conical
        bottom wall 41 which terminates in the dependent coaxial conduit
        21. The top of chamber 12 is closed by a wall 42 through which
        inlet conduit 20 projects to a point below top wall 42. A
        preferably rectangular inlet nozzle 34 communicates with the
        upper part of chamber 12 through cylindrical wall 40 in a
        direction tangential to the cylindrical wall 40. The nozzle 34
        is preferably of greater height than width and upon the flow of
        liquid therethrough into chamber 12 a rotating liquid and vapor
        vortex is produced. </p>
      <p>The system 10 is charged with a low boiling point fluorocarbon
        compound for example, R-11. Under normal operating conditions
        with R-11, pressure regulator sensor 31 is adjusted to 500
        pounds per square inch, absolute, fuel control network 33
        adjusted for a liquid outlet temperature in pipe 18 of 380° F. </p>
      <p>Under normal operating conditions the pressures and temperature
        are as above set forth. The conditions of the working liquid in
        pipe 18 are such that it is in a state of nucleated boiling with
        a highly efficient heat transfer from the pipe to the liquid.
        The hot pressurized liquid issues from nozzle 20 effecting the
        vaporization of about 10-20 percent by weight of the liquid
        discharged therein under the above conditions. By reason of the
        strong centrifugal force accompanying the vortex the liquid
        fraction and vapor fractions rapidly and efficiently separate,
        the liquid fraction traveling to the wall 40 and separating
        downwardly through funnel 41 and conduit 21 and the vapor
        fraction flowing upwardly through conduit 23. The vapor flows
        through and drives engine 12 the exhaust of which is liquefied
        in the pressurized condenser 14 and recirculated through heat
        exchange unit 18 by pump 15. The liquid fraction, on the other
        hand, flows into tank 22 from which it is withdrawn by pump 17
        and recirculated through heat exchange unit 18. </p>
      <p>A drop in demand of pressurized such as accompanies the closing
        down of throttle valve 24 results in an increase in the pressure
        in chamber 12 which in turn reduces the delivery rate or fuel to
        the burner 16 to return the pressure therein to the regulated
        value. Any tendency for the temperature in pipe 18 to drift from
        the preset temperature is overcome by the regulating system
        including network 33 and sensing element 30 which automatically
        varies the fuel control valve. </p>
      <p>According to a specific example of the improved apparatus the
        diameter of vapor discharge conduit 21 is 1.5 inches, the
        conduit 23 projecting 3 inches into chamber 12. The diameter of
        chamber 12 is 5 inches and its height is 8 inches and the height
        of conical wall 41 is 4 inches. The nozzle transverse cross
        section is one inch high and 1/4 inches wide and the inside

        <p><b><font size="+1">Prime Mover System</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Wallace L. Minto and Leonard J. Keller</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The present invnetion relates to prime mover systems. </p>
      <p>In US Patent # 3,479,817 and in British Patent Specification
        No. 1,251,484 there are described external combustion engine
        systems employing as a drive medium in a closed sealed circuit,
        fluocarbon compounds having low latent heats of vaporization and
        desirable boiling points. While the systems described in the
        aforesaid British and US patents are in many respects superior
        to the conventional prime mover systems employing steam as the
        drive medium, the use therein of conventional vapor engines, as
        typified by the turbine and reciprocating engine is accompanied
        by numerous drawbacks and disadvantages. These drawbacks and
        disadvantages are consequent to the operating and flow
        characteristics of the conventional engines particularly when
        employed with the fluocarbon drive medium, whose properties in
        many critical areas are radically different from that of steam.
        In addition to the usual drawbacks of the reciprocating engine,
        including high inertial losses, poor torque speed
        characteristics, high friction and high maintenance
        requirements, the high losses and inefficiencies attendant to
        the operation of that engine due to the numerous changes in the
        direction of flow of the drive medium through the engine are
        aggravated by the use of a fluorocarbon drive medium because of
        its relatively high specific weight. The turbine, on the other
        hand, is a low-torque engine which in many applications requires
        the use of expensive energy consuming speed reducing
        transmissions, is inefficient at low speeds, requires relatively
        high inlet-exhaust pressure difference, and has a relatively
        high size to torque ratio. Thus the use of reciprocating engines
        or turbines with fluorocarbon drive medium leaves something to
        be desired. </p>
      <p>The object of the present invention is to provide a prime mover
        system which has a high efficiency, ruggedness, simplicity,
        excellent torque and speed characteristics, low maintenance
        requirements, and great reliability, adaptability and
        versatility. </p>
      <p>According to the present invention there is provided a prime
        mover system comprising a closed sealed circuit containing a
        drive medium having a latent heat of vaporization of less than
        100 gram calories per gram ad a boiling point less than 95° C
        atmospheric pressure, said closed sealed circuit comprising: </p>
      <p>A vapor engine including at least two male and female members
        defining oppositely pitched helical screws intermeshing along a
        longitudinally extending area of engagement and extending from a
        leading input end to a trailing outlet end, a casing housing the
        screws and having faces in substantially fluid tight engagement
        with the peripheries of the screws and an inlet communicating
        with the trailing end of the female screw, the female screw
        having chamber defining grooves and the male having helical
        lobes engaging the chambers along the intermeshing area, the
        screws rotating in predetermined opposite directions under the
        influence of a pressurized fluid introduced through the input
        port; </p>
      <p>Means including an input and an output for heating and
        vaporizing the drive medium; </p>
      <p>Means including a condenser having an input and output for
        cooling and liquefying the drive medium; </p>
      <p>Means for injecting liquid drive medium from the cooling and
        liquefying means into the heating and vaporizing means input; </p>
      <p>Means connecting the output of the heating and vaporizing means
        to the input of the engine; and </p>
      <p>Means connecting the output of the engine to the input of the
        cooling and liquefying means. </p>
      <p>An output drive shaft is connected to one or both screws and
        projects by way of suitable seals or glands through the casing.
        It should be noted that more than two intermeshing rotor screws
        may be employed, for example two female rotors engaging a common
        male rotor. Examples of mechanisms which may be employed and
        modified for the present purposes are described, in among
        others. US Patents Nos. 1,696,802 No. 2,578,196, and No.
        3,016,842. </p>
      <p>The drive medium should be a fluorocarbon compound, preferably
        having at least two carbon atoms and three fluorine atoms per
        molecule, and in addition may contain hydrogen, oxygen, silicon
        and chlorine atoms in any desired combination to obtain the
        optimum thermodynamic properties desired. Mixtures and
        azeotropes of two or more of the above compounds may be employed
        as the drive medium and there may be added a suitable compatible
        high boiling point lubricant which is liquid at normal
        temperatures, preferably a fluorosilicone lubricant. The above
        fluorocarbon compounds are characterized by their high
        lubricity, stability, vapor range and non-inflammability as well
        as their low heat of vaporization. </p>
      <p>Preferably the engine is provided with means for controlling
        the vapor cut-off to the successive helical screw chambers and
        hence the chamber expansion ratio and engine torque. Expansion
        ratio of 1:1.5 to 1:20 are employed to advantage, the preferred
        range being 1:3 to 1:10 for operation without simultaneous
        liquid injection. Increasing the expansion ratio increases the
        engines conversion efficiency, while decreasing the ratio
        maximizes output torque. By adjusting the expansion ratios the
        need for variable speed transmissions or torque converters is
        obviated, and such adjustment is achieved by varying the point
        at which communication between successive rotor chambers and the
        engine input is cut off, and this may be accomplished by
        providing peripherally-spaced input ports and controlling the
        communication between the ports and the heated vaporized drive
        medium. The engine vapor is advantageously directed at the
        leading faces of the helical chamber grooves so that the inertia
        of the input vapor is also converted to mechanical energy with a
        resulting increase in engine efficiency, particularly at high
        engine speeds. </p>
      <p>A further increase in efficiency is achieved by injecting or
        admixing with the engine inlet vaporized drive medium, medium in
        the liquid state. Unlike most substances the fluorocarbon
        compounds suitable for use as drive media tend to superheat upon
        isoentropic expansion from the saturated vapor. The superheat
        enthalpy may be used to vaporize additional liquid drive medium
        within the engine, increasing the volume of vapor and furnishing
        additional work of expansion. The pressure required to inject
        the liquid into the engine may be supplied by the boiler feed or
        other pump. The temperature of the liquid may be as low as that
        of the condenser outlet, or as high as that of the hot saturated
        liquid in the boiler in equilibrium with the saturated vapor
        being used to drive the engine, or any intermediate temperature.
      </p>
      <p>The proportion of liquid to be injected is readily calculable
        from the relative enthalpies of the liquid injected and that of
        the exhaust vapor that would occur without admixture of liquid.
        In this calculation, allowance should be made for the fact that
        expansion of the vapor in the engine is not truly isoentropic,
        hence the enthalpy and superheat of the exhaust is greater than
        it would be is expansion was truly isoentropic. The proportion
        of liquid injected into the engine should be such that the
        resultant exhaust, after admixture, contains a minimum of
        superheat. Indeed, it is preferable that the exhaust condition
        be within the saturation line at condenser pressure, say at 80%
        or 90% quality. The presence of liquid droplets suspended in the
        vapor materially improves sealing across lines of approximation
        of the surfaces of the moving engine parts and assists in
        lubricating them to minimize wear and tear. By such admixture of
        liquid with the engine inlet vapor, a greater total volume of
        gas passes through the engine, and the work output of the engine
        becomes a larger fraction of the net heat inputs to the boiler,
        resulting in improved thermal efficiency of the system. It is to
        be noted that this advantageous result can only be obtained with
        substances which superheat upon expansion of their saturated
        vapors. </p>
      <p>The admixture of liquid and gas should preferably take place
        within the engine expansion chambers, although may take place at
        any point prior thereto, since it will require a finite period
        of time to reach equilibrium, which will occur under the
        turbulent conditions of flow within the engine. It is
        advantageous to inject a portion of the liquid at relatively low
        temperature into the engine by such means as to cause it to flow
        through the bearings, thereby cooling and lubricating them. The
        liquid injected into the bearings at the high pressure end will
        admix with the vapor in the engine, increasing its efficiency as
        outlined above. </p>
      <p>The fluorocarbon lubricant is admixed with the original charge
        of fluorocarbon drive fluid, in which it is soluble,
        particularly at elevated temperatures. Since the fluorosilicone
        is soluble therein, ebullition of the fluorocarbon in the boiler
        results in a vapor containing entrained microdroplets of
        fluorosilicone, which are carried into the engine and lubricate
        its moving parts. The fluorosilicone droplets dissolve in the
        fluorocarbon liquid in the condenser and the resultant solution
        has higher lubricity than the fluorocarbon alone, lubricating
        the boiler feed pump, circulating pump seals and all other
        moving parts in the system. The fluorsilicone is unaffected by
        the relatively low boiler temperatures required to vaporize the
        fluorocarbon drive medium (less than 250° C). Hence it
        circulated freely and unchanged throughout the entire system. We
        have found that less than 1 percent of fluorosilicone is
        adequate, and 0.2% by weight is out usual proportion. </p>
      <p>The prime mvoer system of the present invnetion employing as a
        drive medium the specified fluorocarbon compound and helical
        screw engine is far superior to a system using a fluorocarbon
        drive medium and conventional vapor engines in its lower cost,
        high efficiency, versatility and adaptability and its improved
        torque speed characteristics, great reliability and low
        maintenance. Moreover, the improved system is far superior to a
        corresponding system employing steam as a drive medium for
        similar reasons, including the poor lubricity of steam and its
        tendency to condense on expansion. </p>

      <p>The reference numeral 10 designates a helical screw rotor
        engine which forms part of a closed vapor liquid circuit of the
        nature described in US Patent No. 3,479,817 and British
        Specification 1,251,484. The engine 10comprises a housing 11
        (Figure 2) including opposite end walls 12 and 13 and a
        peripheral wall 14 having a transverse cross-section delineated
        by intersecting circles. </p>
      <p>A pair of mating, helical screw, male and female defining
        rotors 16 and 17 respectively are located in the housing 11 and
        are provided with axial end shafts 18 which are journaled in
        corresponding pairs of axially aligned bearings mounted on end
        plates 12 and 13, at least one of the shafts 18, for example
        that connected to female rotor 17, projecting by way of a
        suitable seal through one of the end plates and defining the
        engine drive or output shaft. </p>
      <p>The rotors 16 and17 fit in the casing 14 to close tolerances to
        minimize any leakage between the rotors and the peripheral and
        end faces of housing 11. The female rotor 17 has a plurality of
        similar helical chambers or cylinders defining grooves 19 formed
        therein, each of which extends for somewhat less than 360
        degrees about the rotor 17 from the leading to the trailing end
        thereof, example 6 grooves 19 in the illustrated embodiment. The
        male rotor 16 includes a plurality of similar helical piston
        defining lobes 20, four in number in the illustrated embodiment.
        Successive lobes 20 register with successive grooves 19 along a
        longitudinally-extending intermeshing zone and form a rolling
        fluid tight engagement therewith with the opposite concurrent
        rotation of the meshing rotors 19and 20. Thus the lobes 20
        define pistons which slide along cylinder or chamber defining
        grooves 19 so that these successive chambers expand from the
        leading or input end proximate end plate 13 at the rotor
        intermeshing zone with the rotors 16 and 17 rotating clockwise
        and counterclockwise respectively as viewed in Figure 3. The
        lobes 20 disengage respective grooves 19 in less than one
        revolution and before the leading end of the respective groove
        again reaches the intermeshing zone. </p>
      <p>A pair of pressurized vapor inlet conduits A and B respectively
        extend through corresponding openings in leading end plate 13
        providing communication with the leading end of housing 11 and
        grooves 19 at a point shortly following the rotor intermeshing
        zone in the clockwise direction therefrom wherein the chamber in
        the communicating groove 19 is expanded a small predetermined
        amount by the mating lobe 20, and at a point further removed in
        the clockwise direction from the first point where the chamber
        in the groove 19 registering therewith is further expanded by
        the mating lobe 20. Thus the engine expansion chamber defined by
        mutual engaging groove 19 and love 20 is greater when
        communicating with conduit B than with conduit A and receives a
        greater volume of pressurized vapor in the former case, that is
        when the pressurized vapor is fed to the chamber by conduit B or
        by both conduits A and B, than by conduit A alone. </p>
      <p>A pair of exhaust conduits C and D, respectively, provide
        communication with the grooves 19 through the trailing end plate
        12 and are positioned in a manner similar to conduits A and B.
        Thus successive grooves 19 maintain their pressure even after
        they have been disengaged by corresponding lobes 20 by reason of
        the closure of opposite ends thereof until their trailing ends
        reach exhaust conduit C through which the pressurized vapor in
        the corresponding grooves is discharged. It should be noted that
        pressurized vapor may be fed to conduits C and D and conduits A
        and B connected to exhaust under which conditions the rotors 16
        and 17 will be rotated in a reverse direction to that when the
        pressurized vapor is fed through conduits A and B. </p>
      <p>The conduits A and B as well as the conduits C and D extend in
        a direction toward the leading face 21 of the respective groove
        in registry therewith, preferably perpendicular thereto. Thus,
        the pressurized vapor fed by any of the conduits A, B, C, or D
        into the engine impinges on the corresponding leading groove
        face 21 to impart torque to the rotors as a consequence of the
        momentum of the inflowing vapor. </p>
      <p>As seen in Figure 1 of the drawing the conduits A and B are
        connected respectively to the outlet ports 22a and 22b of a
        valve 22 having an inlet port 22c and the conduits C and D are
        connected respectively to the outlet ports 23a and 23b of a
        valve 23 having an inlet port 23c, the valves 22 and 23 each
        having actuators or spindles for selectively connecting the
        inlet ports to both respective outlet ports or the leading of
        the respective outlet ports that is ports 22a and 23a or to cut
        off the outlet ports. The valve inlet ports 22c and 23c are
        respectively connected to the outlet ports 24a and 24b of a
        valve 24 having inlet ports 24c and 24d which are alternatively
        respectively connected to the outlet ports 24a and 24b or 24b
        and 24a. </p>
      <p>A drive medium heater or heat exchange unit 26 of any suitable
        type is heated in any suitable manner, for example by a
        conventional oil or gas burner, to raise the temperature of the
        liquid drive medium therein to close to the coiling point
        thereof, preferably to its nucleated boiling point, at the
        pressure I the heater unit, the inlet to the heater unit 26
        being connected to the outlet of a condensate pump 28 which may
        be driven by engine 10 or by any suitable auxiliary drive means.
        The inlet to condensate pump 28 is connected to the outlet of a
        liquid drive medium reservoir tank 29 whose inlet is connected
        to the outlet of a heat exchange condenser unit 30 which may be
        suitably cooled by air or water. The inlet to condenser 30 is
        connected to valve port 24d. </p>
      <p>The outlet of heater 26 is connected to the inlet of an
        expansion chamber 32 of the structure described in the
        abovementioned British Patent Specification, the vapor outlet of
        which is connected successively through a selectively operable
        throttle valve 34 to valve port 24c. The liquid outlet of
        expansion chamber 32 is connected to the inlet to heater 26 and
        through a throttle valve 37 advantageously adjustable with
        throttle valve 34 to the inlet of throttle valve 34. </p>
      <p>The circuit illustrated in Figure 1 is closed and hermetically
        sealed and is charged with a fluorocarbon drive medium of the
        nature specified above, for example R-113, R-114, R-216 or other
        fluorocarbon compounds with like properties and mixtures
        thereof. In addition the drive medium may have advantageously
        admixed therein, preferably less than 1 percent by weight, for
        example 0.2 percent of the drive medium, of a lubricant which is
        stable and inert in the drive medium and liquid at the pressures
        and temperatures encountered in the network, for example, the
        fluorosilicone lubricants. The pressures and temperatures are
        regulated to the desired values in the manner described in the
        above identified British and USA patent specifications. </p>
      <p>Considering now the operation of the prime mover system
        described above, under normal forward low torque operating
        conditions the valve 23 is adjusted to provide communication
        between only ports 22a and 22c, the valve 23 is adjusted to
        interconnect ports 23a, 23b and 23c and valve 24 is adjusted to
        interconnect ports 23a, 23b and 23c and valve 24 is adjusted to
        interconnect valve ports 24a to 24c and 24b to 24d. The drive
        medium is heated just to the point of nucleated boiling in
        heater 26 and expanded in chamber 32 to produce vapor and liquid
        fractions. Part of the liquid fraction is recirculated by pump
        36 to the heater 26 and part through valve 37 where it is
        admixed with the vapor from chamber 32 flowing through valve 34.
        It should be noted that the flow of the liquid drive medium from
        chamber 32 may be completely returned to the heater 26 and none
        admixed with the vapor. The drive vapor, with or without any
        drive medium liquid enters engine 10 through conduit A, and
        causes the rotation of rotors 16 and 17, by reason of the
        pressure and expansion of the vapor, assisted by the evaporating
        liquid, as earlier explained, and the reaction to the inlet flow
        to the drive medium. Since there is an early cut of the inlet of
        conduit A a relatively small amount of the drive medium enters
        the successive engine cylinders with a resulting high expansion
        ratio and low torque. The engine exhausts through conduits C and
        D and the exhaust flows through valves 23 and 24 and is cooled
        and liquefied in condenser 30 and stored in reservoir 29 from
        which it is pumped by pump 28 to the input of heater 26. If a
        greater engine output torque is desired valve 22 is adjusted to
        open ports 22a and 22b so that drive medium is delivered by
        conduits A and B to delay the vapor cut off point to a larger
        engine expansion and deliver a greater amount of drive medium to
        successive chambers and hence reduce the expansion ration and
        increase the engine output torque. The engine rotation is
        reversed merely by adjusting valve 24 so that ports 24a and 24b
        communicate with ports 24d and 24c respectively, the engine 10
        operating reversely in a manner similar to its forward operation
        except that conduits A and B are now exhaust and C and D feed
        conduits. The engine speed may be varied by adjusting the
        throttle valve 34. The lubricant carried by the drive medium is
        circulated as described earlier. </p>
      <p>The optimum operating parameters of the drive medium throughout
        the circuit and the engine expansion ratios depend on the
        specific drive medium and the use of liquid drive medium with
        the vapor. Thus expansion ratios of 1:1.5 to 1:20 are highly
        effective with expansion rations of 1:3 to 1:10 being preferred
        in the absence of injected liquid drive medium. Where employed,
        the optimum ratio of liquid drive medium to the vapor drive
        medium and the optimum engine expansion ratios depend on the
        particular drive medium employed and other parameters and may be
        readily determined. </p>
      <p>Advantageously the drive medium temperatures and pressures are
        90° C to 325° C and 45 psia to 1000 psia at the engine inlet,
        25° C to 150° C and 5 psi to 250 psia at the engine exhaust, 25°
        C to 150° C and 5 psia to 250 psia at the condenser outlet and
        25° C to 150° C and 45 psia to 1000 psia at the heater inlet.
        The following is given by way of illustration of specific
        operating parameters which may be employed with the working
        fluids or drive mediums specified: </p>
