      <div style="text-align: center;"><big><span style="font-weight:
            bold;">Liquid Glass is probably the world’s most versatile
            new technology ?</span></big><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      </div>
      <br>
      “SiO2- ultra thin layering” is the technical term for Liquid
      Glass. Apart from a select group of professionals, few people in
      the UK know about this stunning technology. If you walk around
      Ataturk’s Mausoleum in Ankara you are walking on it; if you visit
      certain hospitals in the UK you are touching it. If you see an
      unusually clean train you are probably looking at it, and if you
      wonder how your white settee looks so clean, you may be sitting on
      it. All of these surfaces have been coated with invisible glass.<br>
      <br>
      The flexible and breathable glass coating is approximately 100
      nanometres thick (500 times thinner than a human hair), and so it
      is completely undetectable. It is food safe, environmentally
      friendly (winner of the Green Apple Award) and it can be applied
      to almost any surface within seconds . When coated, all surfaces
      become easy to clean and anti- microbially protected (Winner of
      the NHS Smart Solutions Award ). Houses, cars, ovens, wedding
      dress or any other protected surface become stain resistant and
      can be easily cleaned with water ; no cleaning chemicals are
      required. Amazingly a 30 second DIY application to a sink unit
      will last for a year or years, depending on how often it is used.
      But it does not stop there - the coatings are now also recognised
      as being suitable for agricultural and in-vivo application. Vines
      coated with SiO2 don’t suffer from mildew, and coated seeds grow
      more rapidly without the need for anti-fungal chemicals. This will
      result in farmers in enjoying massively increased yields . Trials
      for in-vivo applications are subject to a degree of secrecy, but
      Neil McClelland, the UK Project Manager for Nanopool GmbH,
      describes the results as “stunning”.<br>
      <br>
      “Items such as stents can be coated, and this will create anti
      sticking features - catheters , and sutures which are a source of
      infection, will also cease to be problematic.”<br>
      <br>
      When asked about how the technology works, Neil, said “In essence,
      we extract molecules of SiO2 (the primary constituent of glass)
      from quartz sand, and then we add the molecules to water or
      ethanol. Unfortunately, as they say in the movies , if I told you
      any more …..”. Neil comments further, “The really clever part is
      that there are no added nano-particles , resins or additives- the
      coatings form and bond due to quantum forces. Our research informs
      us that in all probability, we offer the most versatile coating in
      the world. We are happy to hear about any other technology which
      offers the same range of applications. Very soon almost every
      product that you purchase will be protected with some form of easy
      -to -clean coating. It just so happens that we offer something
      that everyone finds fascinating . The concept of spray -on glass
      is just mind -boggling”.<br>
      <br>
      This technology is now available for domestic use in Germany. Full
      scale retail availability in the UK will commence in early 2010<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">If it Works and is Safe, It Could
        Change the World</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A special coating technically known as "SiO2 ultra-thin layering",
      but more memorably called "spray-on liquid glass", has been
      invented in Turkey at the Saarbrücken Institute for New Materials
      (the patent is owned by Nanopool). It is non-toxic promises to
      "protect virtually any surface against almost any damage from
      hazards such as water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial
      infections [...] the coating is also flexible and breathable,
      which makes it suitable for use on an enormous array of products."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">How Does it Work?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The details are still secret, but based on the information that is
      available, it seems like a pretty simple process. They purify
      silicon dioxide (SiO2, which is basically what you find in regular
      glass) from quartz sand, add water or ethanol molecules, and then
      through an unknown process are able to spray this on surfaces and
      get a very thin film of glass (100 nanometers, or 15-30 molecules)
      to stick. "The really clever part is that there are no added
      nano-particles, resins or additives- the coatings form and bond
      due to quantum forces." They also claim that it is very safe
      (these is already a lot of these types of inert molecules out in
      the wild, though I think it stills needs to be rigorously tested
      for toxicity).<br>

      <br>
      Physorg has a few more details: "Food processing companies in
      Germany have already carried out trials of the spray, and found
      sterile surfaces that usually needed to be cleaned with strong
      bleach to keep them sterile needed only a hot water rinse if they
      were coated with liquid glass. The levels of sterility were higher
      for the glass-coated surfaces, and the surfaces remained sterile
      for months. [...] A year-long trial of the spray in a Lancashire
      hospital also produced "very promising" results for a range of
      applications including coatings for equipment, medical implants,
      catheters, sutures and bandages. The war graves association in the
      UK is investigating using the spray to treat stone monuments and
      grave stones, since trials have shown the coating protects against
      weathering and graffiti. Trials in Turkey are testing the product
      on monuments such as the Ataturk Mausoleum in Ankara. "<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Promising, but Let's Wait and See</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I'm still waiting for more tests (real-world and lab) before
      getting too excited. But if it works as promised, this could be a
      new super-material like graphene, with multiple applications in
      tons of different fields. And if it really makes things more
      durable and reduces or removes the need for strong chemicals to
      clean something, it could have a pretty significant positive
      environmental impact. But it could also have unforeseen effects,
      so let's not rush to put this everywhere. <br>

      The fissure was induced in order present an image which shows the
      characteristics of the coating. The image shows the SiO2 coating
      on a filament of a microfibre.<br>
      <br>
      Spray-on liquid glass is transparent, non-toxic, and can protect
      virtually any surface against almost any damage from hazards such
      as water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial infections. The
      coating is also flexible and breathable, which makes it suitable
      for use on an enormous array of products.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid glass spray (technically termed “SiO2 ultra-thin
      layering”) consists of almost pure silicon dioxide (silica, the
      normal compound in glass) extracted from quartz sand. Water or
      ethanol is added, depending on the type of surface to be coated.
      There are no additives, and the nano-scale glass coating bonds to
      the surface because of the quantum forces involved. According to
      the manufacturers, liquid glass has a long-lasting antibacterial
      effect because microbes landing on the surface cannot divide or
      replicate easily.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid glass was invented in Turkey and the patent is held by
      Nanopool, a family-owned German company. Research on the product
      was carried out at the Saarbrücken Institute for New Materials.
      Nanopool is already in negotiations in the UK with a number of
      companies and with the National Health Service, with a view to its
      widespread adoption.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid glass spray produces a water-resistant coating only
      around 100 nanometers (15-30 molecules) thick. On this nanoscale
      the glass is highly flexible and breathable. The coating is
      environmentally harmless and non-toxic, and easy to clean using
      only water or a simple wipe with a damp cloth. It repels bacteria,
      water and dirt, and resists heat, UV light and even acids. UK
      project manager with Nanopool, Neil McClelland, said soon almost
      every product you purchase will be coated with liquid glass.<br>
      <br>
      Food processing companies in Germany have already carried out
      trials of the spray, and found sterile surfaces that usually
      needed to be cleaned with strong bleach to keep them sterile
      needed only a hot water rinse if they were coated with liquid
      glass. The levels of sterility were higher for the glass-coated
      surfaces, and the surfaces remained sterile for months.<br>
      <br>
      Other organizations, such as a train company and a hotel chain in
      the UK, and a hamburger chain in Germany, are also testing liquid
      glass for a wide range of uses. A year-long trial of the spray in
      a Lancashire hospital also produced “very promising” results for a
      range of applications including coatings for equipment, medical
      implants, catheters, sutures and bandages. The war graves
      association in the UK is investigating using the spray to treat
      stone monuments and grave stones, since trials have shown the
      coating protects against weathering and graffiti. Trials in Turkey
      are testing the product on monuments such as the Ataturk Mausoleum
      in Ankara.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid glass coating is breathable, which means it can be used
      on plants and seeds. Trials in vineyards have found spraying vines
      increases their resistance to fungal diseases, while other tests
      have shown sprayed seeds germinate and grow faster than untreated
      seeds, and coated wood is not attacked by termites. Other vineyard
      applications include coating corks with liquid glass to prevent
      “corking” and contamination of wine. The spray cannot be seen by
      the naked eye, which means it could also be used to treat clothing
      and other materials to make them stain-resistant. McClelland said
      you can “pour a bottle of wine over an expensive silk shirt and it
      will come right off”.<br>
      <br>
      In the home, spray-on glass would eliminate the need for scrubbing
      and make most cleaning products obsolete. Since it is available in
      both water-based and alcohol-based solutions, it can be used in
      the oven, in bathrooms, tiles, sinks, and almost every other
      surface in the home, and one spray is said to last a year.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid glass spray is perhaps the most important nanotechnology
      product to emerge to date. It will be available in DIY stores in
      Britain soon, with prices starting at around £5 ($8 US). Other
      outlets, such as many supermarkets, may be unwilling to stock the
      products because they make enormous profits from cleaning products
      that need to be replaced regularly, and liquid glass would make
      virtually all of them obsolete.<br>

          [0001] The invention relates to a method for preparing a
          composition, is dispersed in an aqueous solution in which at
          least one gel-forming substance. The invention also relates to
          a composition, in particular for coating surfaces, which
          consists at least from an aqueous solution and at least one
          gel-forming substance.<br>
          <br>
          [0002] Sol-gel processes are wet processes, which are for
          example the deposition of homogeneous, nano-crystalline
          ceramic oxide coatings or keramischorganischer used. The
          special feature of sol-gel process is that the production of
          coating each of a liquid sol state proceeds, which is
          converted by a sol-gel transformation into a solid gel
          state.As brine dispersions of solid particles in the size
          range be used between 1 nm to 100 nm, which are dispersed in
          water or organic solvents. Sol-gel process usually go out of
          brines based on organometallic polymers. The transition from a
          liquid sol is then used for coating each of the gel state,
          where there is a three-dimensional network of nanoparticles in
          the solvent, so that the gel is replaced by solid state
          properties.The transfer of the gel into a solid oxide coating
          is controlled by a heat treatment in air.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Sol-gel coatings influence the properties of surfaces.
          Depending on the nature of the brine and its impurities, hard
          and scratch-resistant surfaces are generated by such a
          coating. Sol-gel coatings can be performed on metals, glasses,
          synthetic and natural polymers.There exist in this area a
          number of patents and publications, both of which are only
          mentioned a few examples (HK Schmidt, Organically modified
          silicates as inorganic-organic polymers, RM Laine (Ed.),
          Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers with special properties,

          [0004] The simultaneous hydrolysis of inorganic salts and
          organic silanes gives coatings with an adjustable flexibility
          to each other depending on the ratio of the inorganic and
          organic components (T. Textor, D. Knittel, T. Bahners,
          E.Schollmeyer, Inorganic-organic hybrid polymers for coating
          textile materials, Current Trends in Polymer Science, Vol 8,
          2003, page 127-133).<br>
          <br>
          [0005] The chemical compounds that are capable of volatile and
          other organic compounds bind to, are known cyclodextrins.
          These are macrocyclic molecules, which are constructed from
          six, seven or eight [alpha]-D-glucose units. There are
          ring-shaped molecules that possess a hydrophobic cavity.In
          this cavity a number of organic molecules is deposited. This
          changes the physical and chemical properties of the embedded
          molecules. The embedded molecules possess, for example,
          compared to the free molecules, a much lower vapor pressure
          and an improved stability against degradation by light or
          oxygen. For this reason, cyclodextrins have been used for many
          years in the field of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals
          (J.Szejtli, Cyclodextrin Technology, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1988).<br>
          <br>
          [0006] A permanent fixation of cyclodextrins on various
          textile materials is known (for BH-J Buschmann, D. Knittel, E.
          Schollmeyer, DE 4036328;. DE 40 35 378 A and DE 100 60 710 A).
          The binding of the cyclodextrins by chemical bonds or physical
          interactions, so that their removal by washing processes is
          not possible.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] The removal of odors andthe fragrance of textile
          materials with the aid of cyclodextrins or cyclodextrin
          derivatives is also known (eg, T. Trinh, JM Gardlik, TJ Banks
          and F. Benvegnu U.S. 5,094,761, JM Gardlik, T. Trinh, TJ Banks
          and F. Benvegnu 5.23461 million U.S., T . Trinh, JM Gardlik,
          TJ Banks and F. Benvegnu EP 0392607 and JM Gardlik, T. Trinh,
          TJ Banks and F. Benvegnu, EP-A-0 392 606).The used
          cyclodextrins have no affinity for the fiber material so that
          they do not adhere to the textile materials.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] The adsorptive accumulation of cyclodextrins with
          substituted polyethylene glycols of various materials, such as
          hair and textile materials is well known (A. Schmidt, O.
          Lammerschop and H. Küster, DE 103 44 967 A). These
          cyclodextrin derivatives can partlybe a normal household
          washing process removed from the surface of materials.<br>
          <br>

          method and an alternative composition for coating surfaces.<br>

          [0010] This object is inventively achieved by a method for
          preparing a composition of the aforementioned kind in which
          the dispersion is at least one cyclodextrin added.<br>

          inventive method provides that the cyclodextrin at a final
          concentration of 0.1 to 15 wt-%, Preferably 5 to 10 wt -%,
          particularly preferably from 1 to 5 wt -%, especially 2 to 4
          wt -% is added.<br>

          is added to /.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] Here, the cyclodextrin in the dispersion may be
          dissolved or dispersed.<br>
          <br>

          Perfluoroalkylaminen.<br>
          <br>

          coating, such as a silicon oxide coating, by their
          substituents, which act almost as anchor molecules. Due to the
          inventive derivatization or modification of cyclodextrins is
          also advantageously able to handle these useful materials in a
          sol-gel process and permanently integrate into an ultra-thin
          coating.<br>

          method is provided that can be stored in the
          Cyclodextrinderivatmoleküle organic substances. It may be, for

          <br>
          [0027] In an advantageous embodiment of the inventions
          according to the composition is further provided that the
          gel-forming substance is at least one metal oxide or a mixture
          of metal oxides, preferably SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2 and / or R
          VerSiOn with R = H, alkyl, aryl , epoxy-alkyl, aminoalkyl, and
          n = 1.5 or 1<br>
          <br>
          [0028] The invention also relates to a method for coating
          surfaces, in which a sol is applied from an aqueous solution,
          at least one gel-forming substance and at least one
          cyclodextrin derivative to a surface and then dried. This
          method is particularly advantageous when the coating is at
          least partly from the composition of the invention is or has
          been made of this.The cyclodextrin derivatives according to
          the invention are derivatized so that they can be processed in
          a sol-gel process and permanently incorporated into a coating
          produced in this process.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Preferably the sol is sprayed onto either the surface
          or the surface immersed in the sol. In both cases,
          advantageously produces an ultra-thin coating that uniformly
          covers the so-coated article.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] The sol can be applied for example to a textile
          material, a nonwoven fabric made of natural or synthetic
          polymers or mixtures of these polymers. Alternatively, the sol
          can also be applied to an inorganic fiber material, preferably
          glass fibers, carbon fibers and / or ceramic fibers, or
          metallic, ceramic, glass-like and / or cellulosic materials.In
          a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the sol
          also on plastics or plastic-like materials are applied.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] The inventive composition is particularly suitable for
          coating of textile materials and / or leather, preferably
          clothing, shoes, diapers, wound dressings or office equipment,
          interior trim and other interior fittings of motor vehicles,
          trains and airplanes.In these applications, in particular, the
          odor-binding properties of the composition and the ability to
          store active substances in the cyclodextrin advantage of<br>
          <br>
          [0032] Also advantageous is the use of the composition for
          coating plastics, preferably sanitation or interior trim and
          other interior fittings of motor vehicles, trains and
          airplanes.Examples are toilet lids and seats and plastic
          components in motor vehicles, the latter being bound in a
          coated form not only smell, but no self-interference, due to
          production have more odor. Is also particularly advantageous
          to coat the plastic housings of mobile phones with coatings
          that are embedded in the antimicrobial substances and / or
          fragrances.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] The invention also includes any object with a nonstick
          surface, which was prepared by the method of the invention and
          / or in which the coated surface comprises the composition of
          the invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] The invention relates for example, ultra-thin coatings
          that are produced by a sol-gel process and have the addition
          to the known properties still an odor-reducing
          properties.Likewise, a storage of insecticides, fungicides or
          other agents into the possible in the sol-gel coating located
          Cyclodetrinderivate. The embedding of the active ingredients
          in the cyclodextrin their stability to degradation by exposure
          to light and oxygen is greatly increased. For drugs that have
          a higher vapor pressure, evaporation is prevented by the
          incorporation in the cavities of the cyclodextrin.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] According to the invention has been shown that some of
          cyclodextrin so in a sol-gel matrix can be stored, that the
          cavities of the cyclodextrins remain still accessible. This
          can produce sol-gel coatings that have both a protective
          layer, or another functional layer formed on the surfaces of
          textile materials, woven fabrics, glass fibers, metals,
          ceramics or wood and have the same odor-reducing properties.In
          addition, a variety of organic compounds are incorporated into
          the cyclodextrins, which are released only by moisture and get
          back to the surface of the coating.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] Known brine based on pure aqueous solutions or mixtures
          of water and alcohols. It can be used preferably metal oxide
          xerogels of SiO 2, R VerSiOn, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2 or mixtures
          thereof, where R = H, alkyl, aryl, epoxy-alkyl, aminoalkyl,
          and can be n = 1.5 or 1.As unsuitable for incorporation into
          the starting sols has been shown [beta]-cyclodextrin. Its
          solubility in the brine is too low. Sols in alcoholic form
          [alpha] -, [beta] - and [gamma]-cyclodextrin precipitation.
          Such solutions are not suitable for the sol-gel process.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] The invention therefore relates to the production
          example, cyclodextrin-salt, which can be in a conventional
          sol-gel process as thin or very thin coating is applied
          uniformly to different materials.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] The invention also relates, for example brine
          containing 0.1 weight -% contained, a cyclodextrin derivative
          -% to 10 wt -%, preferably 1 wt -% to 5 wt.These solutions can
          be applied both in a dipping process as well as by spraying
          onto the desired substrate. After drying, a coating has formed
          on the basis of polymerized SiO2.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] are in principle the following cyclodextrin derivatives
          for incorporation in the composition of the invention:
          partially methylated [beta]-Cyclodextrin (CAVASOL &lt;(R)&gt;
          W7 M, Wacker-Chemie) and hydroxypropyl-[beta]-Cyclodextrin
          (CAVASOL &lt;(R) &gt; W7 HP, Wacker-Chemie).Starting with a
          cyclodextrin derivative with a reactive group, such as
          monochlortriazinsubstituiertes [beta]-cyclodextrin (CAVATEX
          W7MCT, Wacker Chemie GmbH, Burghausen) or other cyclodextrin
          derivative with a reactive group (A. Schmidt, H.-J. Buschmann,
          E . Schollmeyer, DE 101 55 781 A) or the reaction product of
          acrylic acid or an acrylic acid derivative with an
          unsubstituted cyclodextrin, for example, thispolyvinylamine
          (ZD1168/69-3, BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany), polyethylenimine
          (Chemos GmbH), amino siloxane (DMS-A12, ABCR), alkylamines
          (Merck), dialkyl amines (Fluka), chitosan (Sigma-Aldrich),
          polyvinyl alcohol (Fluka) , Perfluoralkylamin
          (Perfluorononylamin, Fluka), amino acids such as glycine
          (Fluka), implemented. Among cyclodextrins [alpha] are - to
          understand and [gamma]-cyclodextrin -, [beta]. The
          above-mentioned reactive derivatives formed, for exampleby
          reaction of [alpha] -, [beta] - and [gamma]-cyclodextrin with
          cyanuric chloride and acrylic acid or acrylic acid
          derivatives.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] The reaction products are water-soluble cyclodextrin
          derivatives mentioned above can be added to the sol as a
          concentrated solution or as a pure substance. After a
          homogeneous solution is formed, it can go no further
          preparations for the application.Of the non-water-soluble
          cyclodextrin derivatives, is produced using ultrasound, a
          dispersion. This is mixed with the corresponding sol and
          applied to a homogenisation of the surface to be equipped.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] The inventive method has the advantage that the sol-gel
          process is combined with equipment to adsorb odors and other
          organic substances.Through the use of cyclodextrin derivatives
          described the effect of odor control is permanent. These
          cyclodextrin derivatives are anchored by their substituents at
          the silicon oxide coating. On the other hand, the
          accessibility of the cyclodextrin cavities is guaranteed,
          leaving the complex-forming properties of the cyclodextrins.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] The cyclodextrin-salt can be applied to metallic and
          ceramic surfaces by a dipping or spraying. After drying, a
          thin layer has formed on the surface that is mechanically
          stable against external influences.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] The cyclodextrin composition is also suitable for the
          impregnation of porous inorganic materials.By immersion of
          these materials into suitable brine, they reach into all the
          pores by capillary forces. After centrifugation, excess sol
          from the pores are removed. After drying, the surfaces of the
          pores are coated by the sol, the pores of the material has
          been preserved.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] Natural materials such as wood and paper can be
          impregnated by dipping into the corresponding
          cyclodextrin-Sole.In this cause the brine one
          hydrophobicisation the surface. In addition, the cyclodextrins
          can be chemical agents against pests are stored. This leads to
          an improved wood preservation.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] Insulating materials that are made from mineral or
          natural fiber materials can be impregnated by immersion in a
          brine cyclodextrin. After drying, the cyclodextrin cavities
          with organic substances, such asInsecticides and fungicides
          are loaded. By coating with the sol, the combustibility of the
          insulating material is reduced from natural fiber materials.
          The loading of the cyclodextrins with insecticides and / or
          fungicides reduce the pest infestation and / or infestation by
          fungi. Another advantage is that do not evaporate at high
          temperatures, the active ingredients from the cyclodextrin
          cavities.This ensures that occurs does not pollute the air by
          these substances.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] Flexible materials such as films, nonwovens and textile
          fabrics, can be fitted by spraying or by a dipping process
          with the cyclodextrin-sols. Depending on the amount of the sol
          is applied to the flexible structure of the material received.
          The sol in fixed cyclodextrins are able to store chemical
          substances from the air. They may, for example by sprayingAs
          with perfumes and other fragrances are loaded.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] A load of other organic substances such as
          insecticides, fungicides, bactericide or biostatically acting
          substances or pharmaceutical active substances is possible. By
          deposition of insecticides and fungicides, for example, a
          parasitic infestation of the materials is prevented.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] After the finishing of nonwovens and / or textile
          fabrics with cyclodextrin brines can be loaded onto the
          cyclodextrin derivatives with pharmaceutical and / or cosmetic
          agents. Come such a finished textile materials in contact with
          human skin, so the stored substances are released by the
          moisture on the skin surface of the skin.The sol-gel coating
          prevents their hydrophobic properties, the growth of skin
          cells, if such fabrics are used as wound dressings. By the
          release of substances that have been stored in the
          cyclodextrins, the healing process of wounds is accelerated.<br>
          <br>
          [0049] The embedding of the cyclodextrin derivatives in a
          sol-gel coating ensures that the cyclodextrins can be removed
          by washing processes or similar processes from the surface of
          the treated materials. It is therefore considered a permanent
          modification of the surface of the corresponding materials.<br>
          <br>

          embodiments as an example.<br>

          MATERIAL SURFACES WITH ODOR-ABSORBING PROPERTIES&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">The invention relates to sol-gel
          coatings, which additionally has known about the properties
          still an odor-reducing properties. Likewise, a storage of
          insecticides, fungicides or other agents in the in the sol-gel
          coating located cyclodextrins possible.The embedding of the
          active ingredients in the cyclodextrins their stability to
          degradation by exposure to light and oxygen is greatly
          increased. For drugs that have a higher vapor pressure,
          evaporation is prevented by the incorporation in the cavities
          of the cyclodextrins.<br>
          <br>
          The production and application of sol-gel coatings on
          different materials is discussed below.<br>
          <br>
          Sol-gel coatings influence the properties of surfaces.
          Depending on the nature of the brine and its impurities, hard
          and scratch-resistant surfaces are generated by such a
          coating. Sol-gel coatings can be performed on metals, glasses,
          synthetic and natural polymers. There exist in this field a
          number of patents and publications, both of which are only
          mentioned a few examples (HKSchmidt, Organically modified
          silicates as inorganic-organic polymers, RM Laine (Ed.),
          Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers with special properties,
          297 - 317, 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands; CJ

          Kaili, DE 19839292 (2000).By the simultaneous hydrolysis of
          inorganic salts and organic silanes gives coatings with an
          adjustable flexibility to each other depending on the ratio of
          the inorganic and organic components (T. Textor, D. Knittel,
          T. Bahners, E. Schollmeyer, Inorganic-organic hybrid polymers

          Science, Vol.8, 2003, Page 127-133;. Bahners T., T. Textor,

          with reactive silanes, in KL Mittal (Ed.), Silanes and Other
          Coupling Agents, Vol 4 "s. 141-152, VSP, Leiden (2007)).
          Coatings by the sol-gel method with a deodorizing effect can
          be produced by the installation of catalytic additives (T.
          Benthien, P. Faber, G. Jonschker, p. Sepeur, H. Schmidt, P.
          Stossel, DE 19,915,377 (1999)).These catalysts are able to
          decompose organic substances at high temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          As chemical compounds that are able to bind and other volatile
          organic compounds, cyclodextrins are known. These are
          macrocyclic molecules, which are constructed from six, seven
          or eight [alpha]-D-glucose units. There are ring-shaped
          molecules that possess a hydrophobic cavity. In this cavity a
          number of organic molecules is deposited.This changes the
          physical and chemical properties of the embedded molecules.
          The embedded molecules possess as compared to the free
          molecules, a much lower vapor pressure and an improved
          stability against degradation by light or oxygen. For this
          reason, cyclodextrins have been used for many years in the
          field of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals (J. Szejtli,
          Cyclodextrin Technology, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1988).<br>
          <br>
          Permanent fixation of cyclodextrins on various textile
          materials is known (eg H.-J. Buschmann, D. Knittel, E.
          Schollmeyer, DE 4036328 and DE 4035378 and DE 10.06071
          million). The binding of the cyclodextrins by chemical bonds
          or physical interactions, so that their removal by washing
          processes is not possible.<br>
          <br>
          The removal of odor or fragrance of textile materials with the
          aid of cyclodextrins orCyclodextrin is also known (eg, T.
          Trinh, JM Gardlik, TJ. Benvegnu F. Banks and U.S. 5,094,761,
          JM Gardlik, T. Trinh, TJ. Benvegnu F. Banks and 5.23461
          million U.S., Trinh T., JM Gardlik, TJ. Banks and F. Benvegnu
          EP 0392607 and JM Gardlik, T. Trinh, TJ. Benvegnu F. Banks and
          EP 0392606). The used cyclodextrins have no affinity for the
          fiber material so that they do not adhere to the textile
          materials.<br>
          <br>
          Adsorptive accumulation of cyclodextrins with substituted
          polyethylene glycols of various materials, such as hair and
          textile materials is well known (A. Schmidt, O. and H. Küster
          Lammerschop DE 10,344,967). These cyclodextrin derivatives can
          be partly through normal household washing process removed
          from the surface of materials.<br>
          <br>
          The use of cyclodextrins in the preparation of sol-gel
          coatings is described in the literature on principle.Thus, the
          embedding of native [alpha] -, ss-and [gamma]-cyclodextrins
          described in a matrix of amorphous silicon dioxide (F.
          Mizukami, M. Toba and S. Niwa U.S. 4,781,858 (1988) The
          embedding of the cyclodextrins. the matrix improves the
          thermal stability of cyclodextrins. coatings by the sol-gel
          method can also include cyclodextrins, which act as carriers
          for active ingredients (M. Dreja, W. Rybinski of DE 10,126,966
          (2001)).Here, the drug-loaded cyclodextrins are already used
          in the manufacture of coatings. These agents can be
          re-released from the cyclodextrin cavities. It is, however,
          described no release mechanism. According to current
          knowledge, one must assume, however, assume that the described
          in the application of the matrix, drying the water molecules
          are removed almost quantitatively.Small amounts of water are
          required to produce drugs and other substances such as
          perfumes, from the cyclodextrin cavities release (J. Szejtli,
          Cyclodextrin Technology, Kluwer (1988), pages 188-190).<br>
          <br>
          According to the invention has been shown that some of
          cyclodextrin derivatives, egwith one or two substituents such
          as polyvinyl amine, polyallylamine, polyethyleneimine,
          polyethylene glycol and polyvinyl alcohols so in a sol-gel
          matrix can be stored, that the cavities of the cyclodextrins
          remain still accessible.These substituted cyclodextrins are
          almost infinitely soluble in water or aqueous alcoholic
          solutions, so that the disadvantages of low solubility of
          ss-cyclodextrin in water and the native cyclodextrins ([alpha]
          -, ss-and [gamma]-CD) in aqueous alcoholic solutions no longer
          exist.It is possible to produce coatings, sol-gel, both a
          protective layer or other functional layer formed on the
          surfaces of textile materials, woven fabrics, glass fibers,
          metals, wood or wood-like products such as paper, cardboard,
          etc., leather or ceramics and have the same odor-reducing
          properties . The coatings are formed even at room temperature.
          A thermal treatment at temperatures above 40 [deg.] C is not
          required, which allows the use even in very thermally
          sensitive materials. Since the coatings formed are porous, can
          subsequently a variety of organic compounds in the
          cyclodextrins are stored, which are released only by moisture
          and then get back onto the surface of the coating.Since the
          accessibility of the cyclodextrin cavities in the sol-gel
          coatings is given, the cyclodextrins in the matrix chemical
          compounds bind in the air. Thus, the coating has an
          odor-reducing properties. By treatment with an aqueous
          solution can remove all the odor molecules from the
          cyclodextrin, whereby the odor-reducing effect of the coating
          with the cyclodextrin is restored.<br>
          <br>
          Since the charge of cyclodextrins after formation of the
          sol-gel coating is applied, is an influence of the sol-gel
          process through the use of cyclodextrin avoided. In aqueous
          and aqueous ethanolic solutions dissociate the cyclodextrin
          used, so that by the previously may be adversely affected in
          the cyclodextrins bound substances and active ingredients of
          the sol-gel process.This drawback is not with the approach
          described in this application given.<br>
          <br>
          The used cyclodextrin derivatives have an effect biostatic.
          Therefore, the use of additional chemical substances are not
          required to obtain a biostatic or biocidal effect of the
          coating. This makes it possible to produce sol-gel coatings,
          which have simultaneously a biostatic or biocidal and an
          odor-reducing effect.Known brine based on pure aqueous
          solutions or mixtures of water and alcohols. Here are
          preferably made of Si metal-oxide xerogels [theta] 2, R-SiON,
          Al2O3, ZrO2, Ti [theta] 2 [theta] using the mixtures thereof,
          where R = H, alkyl, aryl, epoxy-alkyl, aminoalkyl, and n can
          be 1, 5 or 1. As unsuitable for incorporation into the
          starting sols has proven ss-cyclodextrin. Its solubility in
          the brine is too low.Sols in alcoholic form [alpha] -, ss-and
          [gamma]-cyclodextrin precipitation. Such solutions are not
          suitable for the sol-gel process.<br>
          <br>
          The invention therefore relates to the provision of a coating
          on a substrate, which is produced by the sol-gel method from a
          cyclodextrin and brine can be as thin or very thin coating is

          According to a preferred embodiment, the coating is
          characterized in that the carrier material is a textile
          material, a nonwoven fabric made of natural or synthetic
          polymers or mixtures of these polymers.<br>

          <br>
          The cyclodextrin-salt can be applied to metallic and ceramic
          surfaces by a dipping or spraying.After drying at room
          temperature, a thin layer has formed on the surface that is
          mechanically stable against external influences.<br>
          <br>
          The cyclodextrin-salt are also used for impregnation of porous
          inorganic materials. By immersion of these materials into
          suitable brine they reach into all the pores by capillary
          forces. After centrifugation, excess sol is removed from the
          pores.After drying at room temperature, the surfaces of the
          pores are coated by the sol, the pores of the material has
          been preserved. The coating is permanent.<br>
          <br>
          Natural materials such as wood and paper can be impregnated by
          dipping into the corresponding cyclodextrin-Sole. In this
          cause the brine one hydrophobicisation the surface. In
          addition, the cyclodextrins can be chemical agents against
          pests are stored.This leads to an improved wood preservation.
          In the manufacture of wood particle materials of different
          sizes of wood chips with a binder are pressed together. After
          manufacture the fittings by dipping or spraying with a
          cyclodextrin-salt impregnated. This causes a hydrophobization
          the surface. Simultaneously, the cyclodextrin molecules
          capable of chemical components that can be released from the
          binders are too complex.Thus, the emission of substances that
          can cause an odor nuisance is reduced considerably.<br>
          <br>
          Insulation, made from mineral or natural fiber materials can
          be impregnated by immersion in a brine cyclodextrin. After
          drying, the cyclodextrin cavities with organic substances such
          as insecticides and fungicides are loaded.The coating with the
          sol, the combustibility of the insulating material is reduced
          from natural fiber materials. The loading of the cyclodextrins
          with insecticides and / or fungicides reduce the pest
          infestation and / or infestation by fungi. Another advantage
          is that vaporize at high temperatures, the active ingredients
          are not from the cyclodextrin cavities, since the formed
          cyclodextrin complexes are thermally stable.This ensures that
          occurs does not pollute the air by these substances.<br>
          <br>
          Flexible materials such as films, nonwovens and textile
          fabrics, can be fitted by spraying or by dipping process with
          the cyclodextrin-sols. Depending on the amount of the sol is
          applied to the flexible structure of the material received.
          The sol in fixed cyclodextrins are able to store chemical
          substances from the air. They may also, by spraying, egwith
          perfumes and other fragrances that are loaded. A load of other
          organic substances such as insecticides, fungicides,
          bactericide or biostatically acting substances or
          pharmaceutical active substances is possible. By deposition of
          such insecticides and fungicides, a parasitic infestation of
          the materials is prevented.<br>
          <br>
          After the finishing of nonwovens and / or textile fabrics with
          cyclodextrins, the cyclodextrin-sols with pharmaceutical and /
          or cosmetic active ingredients are loaded. Come such a
          finished textile materials in contact with human skin, so the
          stored substances are released by the moisture on the skin
          surface of the skin.The sol-gel coating prevents their
          hydrophobic properties, the growth of skin cells, if such
          fabrics are used as wound dressings. By the release of
          substances that have been stored in the cyclodextrins, the
          healing process of wounds is accelerated.<br>
          <br>
          By the incorporation of cyclodextrin into a sol-gel coating
          ensures that the cyclodextrins can not be removed by washing
          processes or similar processes from the surface of the treated
          materials. It is therefore considered a permanent modification
          of the surface of the corresponding materials.<br>
          The invention further relates to the use of a
          cyclodextrin-brine as equipment / impregnation of support
          materials.<br>
          <br>
          This invention concerns such as the use of a sol-gel method
          for the cyclodextrin-produced brine containing 0.1 to 10 wt -%
          containing a cyclodextrin derivative that is dissolved or
          dispersed in the sol according to the type as described above
          equipment / impregnation of inorganic or organic support
          materials.<br>

          a water-clear sol.% AI2 (OH) 5ci x 2-3 H2O in 90 wt - - To
          this sol, a solution of 10 wt% ethanol added. By dipping a
          piece of wood in the resulting sol this is impregnated. After
          drying, the piece of wood at room temperature, the sample is
          sprayed with a Permethrinlösung in acetone. After drying, the
          wood is dipped briefly in acetone to remove adsorbed
          permethrin.Evidence of complex formation of cyclodextrin with
          permethrin is done by an aqueous extraction of the wood piece.
          In the extract permethrin by GC-MS analysis is proven.<br>

          The sol prepared in Example 4 is used to a piece of wood
          floors (36 x 17 cm) to be sprayed. For comparative purposes,
          an equally large piece of wood parquet with a 10 wt -%

          water using a pipette. In the case of the sample sprayed with
          the sol is no wetting of the surface. Contrast, one observes a

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Every year the world's agriculture caused billions in damage
          by plant pests such as fungi or Frassschädlinge that infect
          the leaves of crops and damage. Previously, these pests were
          controlled by herbicides, pesticides, according to the
          directory (Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food
          Safety, as of 01.11.2007) to the areas<br>

          belong. All means and substances in common is that they are
          either the protected plant to encourage appropriate defensive
          measures or kill the pests. The plant leaf is next to the stem
          axis and the root of one of three basic institutions of higher
          plants and is known as a body type Phyllom.Leaves are lateral
          outgrowths of the node (nodes) of the stem. The original
          functions of leaves photosynthesis (structure of organic
          materials with the aid of light) and transpiration (water
          evaporation, important for nutrient uptake, and - transport).
          Leaves occur only in plants sprout, that is, at fern-like
          plants (Pteridophyta) and seed plants (Spermatophyta).However,
          they are absent in mosses and algae, at the &lt;"&gt; phallus,
          however, may experience leaf-like structures, but these are
          provided as an analogy of the leaves. The variety of leaf
          shapes is enormous. In some cases, in the course of evolution
          were also leaf organs, the with the original function of the
          leaf, namely, photosynthesis and transpiration, have nothing
          to do more: for example, petals, leaf spines and leaf
          tendrils, and bud scales.<br>
          <br>
          The sheet includes the outside with a final tissue from the
          epidermis, which consists of only one cell layer. The
          epidermis has a waterproof layer of wax to the outside cuticle
          that prevents unregulated evaporation. The cells of the
          epidermis usually have no chloroplasts (the cell components,
          in which photosynthesis takes place).Exceptions are the
          epidermis of hygro, HeIound hydrophytes and partially shade
          leaves, especially the guard of the stomata (stomata), which
          always contain chloroplasts. The stomata are the regulation of
          gas exchange, primarily of water vapor. After the distribution
          of stomata, a distinction is hypo-matic (stomata on the leaf
          base, most common form), amphistomatische (stomata on both
          sides of the leaf) and epistomatische leaves (stomata on the
          leaf surface, suchExample, in floating leaves). The
          attachments are formed by the epidermis hairs (trichomes)
          called. Are involved in the formation and subepidermal cell
          layers, it is called Emergence: Examples are spikes or
          glandular. When mesophyll tissue called the Assimilation. It
          is usually in the structured under the upper epidermis and
          palisade parenchyma located below it spongy.The palisade
          parenchyma consists of an elongated or three layers,
          perpendicular to the leaf surface vertical,
          chloroplastenreicher cells. In the palisade, whose main task
          is to photosynthesis, there are about 80 percent of
          chloroplasts. The spongy parenchyma is composed of irregularly
          shaped cells that form the basis of their form large
          intercellular spaces. The main task of the spongy parenchyma
          is to ensure the ventilation of the parenchymatous tissue.The
          cells are relatively poor in chloroplasts. The vascular
          bundles are often located on the border between the upper
          Palisadenund spongy spongy. The structure resembles that of
          the vascular bundles in the shoot axis and is usually
          collateral. The vascular bundles branch off from the shoot
          axis and pass by without turning the petiole into the blade.
          This includes the xylem to leaf surface, the phloem to the
          leaves.Large vascular bundles are often surrounded by an
          endodermis, which is here called bundle sheath. The bundle
          sheath controls the material exchange between vascular bundles
          and mesophyll. The vascular bundles end blindly in the
          mesophyll. Here, the vascular bundles is reduced still more,
          that is, the first sieve tubes become less and fall out, then
          remain in the xylem only part Schraubentracheiden ending
          ultimately blind.The entire leaf is usually so dense
          interspersed with vascular bundles, leaf cell is that no more
          than seven cells from a vascular bundle. The resulting small
          fields between the vascular bundles are called areoles or
          intercostal fields. The function of the vascular bundles is
          the delivery transport of water and minerals into the leaves
          (through the xylem) and the transport of photosynthates from
          the leaf (through the phloem).<br>
          <br>
          So far, no methods are known which generate as protection
          against fungi and a Frassinsekten whatsoever layer on the
          surface of the plant or leaf surface. So far, it was expected
          to affect the physiology of a coating plant leaf and thereby
          harm the plant would. A coating plant leaf as a protective
          layer must therefore meet two conditions.Had a sufficiently
          large translucency is required to provide the information
          contained in the plant leaf chloroplasts with radiation in the
          range of 320 to 700 nm. A in this wavelength range adsorptive
          or reflective coating acts would affect the energy supply of
          the plant cell. Inside the chloroplasts located as plasmatic
          phase of the stroma.This is interspersed with stroma thylakoid
          membranes (Membraneinstülpungen), the multi-roll-like
          superimposed is the Granum. This may in the membranes as a
          pigment chlorophyll is now embedded in turn absorb light from
          the above-mentioned wavelength range and use this energy for
          the production of ADP (adenosine triphosphate) from ADP
          (adenosine diphosphate) and phosphate.<br>
          <br>
          The second requirement is to meet a nanoscale protective layer
          must plant leaf, the orderly functioning of the stomata.
          Through the stomata (Greek stoma, mouth) or stomata, gas
          exchange is a plant. The stomata are usually of two
          bean-shaped cells called guard-formed, which enclose an
          opening, the gap. Counting the cells that surround the guard
          around, add more, we speak of stomatal apparatus (stomatal
          complex).The pores themselves are, strictly speaking, the
          actual gap openings. Guard-are usually in the lower epidermis
          of plant leaves, the grasses on both sides of the leaf, and
          floating leaf plants only at the top. The gas exchange with
          the surrounding air is especially important for the supply of
          CO2. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants through the
          processes of photosynthesis from the air.Thus, the diffusion
          through the cell walls function optimally, it must be as thin
          or permeable. Such cells evaporate but plenty of water, land
          plants would wither quickly with such leaves. About the
          separation of the intercellular space in the Journal of the
          dry outside air through the stomata, the plant receives
          control over the water loss.Through the pores by evaporation
          (stomatal transpiration or evaporation) instead, which creates
          a suction transported by water from the roots to the leaves:
          further points are important for the stomata. With the water
          are transferred from the soil and nutrients are concentrated
          in the leaves.In addition, the evaporation cools the leaves,
          this overheating in bright sunshine and not the specific
          temperature optimum, the enzymes in the leaf tissues, are not
          exceeded....<br style="font-weight: bold;">

      [0005] DE 20 2005 006,784 A1 describes, a porous Sol gelcoating
      with antimicrobial effective substances/compounds those, prepared
      after the Sol gelprocess, selected is from the group, existing
      from Ag, Zn, cu, SN, I, width unit, Gr, CR, their ions as well as

      <br>
      [0009] It is known to produce Sol gellayers by means of a Sol
      gelprocess. Metallic oxide xerogels become preferably from SiO2,
      R-SiOn, R2SiOn, Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2 or their mixtures used, whereby
      R = H, alkyl, aryl, Epoxi alkyl, Aminoalkyl and n = 1.5 or 1 can
      be. One by the hydrolysis and condensation reactions receive these
      gels from silicon alkoxides. The molecules become connected with
      one another due to the polymerization taken place during the
      process. The total volume of the sols becomes polymerized thereby.
      The polymerized silicon oxides form a SiO2-Gel (see. J.C. Brinker,
      G.W. Sheared one, sol gel Science, Academic press, London 1990).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The continuous condensation bottom alcohol splitting off
      leads to spherical increasing of the particles, which itself
      starting from a thickness of approx. 70 Nm due to the light
      scattering at the particles (Tyndall effect) to prove leave. By a
      procedure referred as gelation sols can change into gels. The
      particles continue to grow, until they touch themselves and
      network by other condensation. Finally thereby a solid phase is
      formed which is penetrated with a liquid phase. As gels
      formbeständige, light deformable disperse systems rich at liquid
      become referred, which of a solid, irregular three-dimensional
      network and a liquid to consist.<br>

      Alkyltriethoxysilane with Azomethinbindung becomes by the
      conversion of aminopropyltriethoxysilanes with
      Benzaldehydderivaten and/or. Acetylacetone used.<br>
      <br>
      Inorganic-oxidic gels become frequent by conversion of element
      alkoxides with alcohol-water mixtures or in pure water prepared.
      The alcohol serves here the generation of an homogeneous reaction
      mixture and can become by other per tables or aprotic solvents
      replaced. The flexibility and porosity of the Sol gellayers can be
      changed by modification of the prescriptions. A higher portion of
      R-SiOn and/or R2SiOn improves the flexibility of the layers, by
      the formation of composite oxides such as Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2 can

      [0028] The invention is the basis the other object, a nanoskalige,
      and antimicrobial, to create in particular biocides coating on
      base of an inorganic polymerized SiO2-Schicht on arbitrary organic

      Nm, there the SiO2-Nanopartikel used in the spraying method on the
      not-lung-common size of &gt; 100 Nm set become.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Also prefered is a coating of the before-described type,
      with which the SiO2-Schicht at least partly consists of R-SiOn,
      and/or R2-SiOn, whereby R = H, alkyl, aryl, Epoxy alkyl or

      <br>
      [0033] Also prefered is a coating of the aforementioned type, with
      which the SiO2 contains layer Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO and/or V2O5
      in arbitrary mixing ratios, preferably in mixing ratios between
      0,1 Gew % and 50% Gew % from the group of the Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2,
      MgO and V2O5, particularly prefered in mixing ratios between 1 Gew
      % and 20 Gew % from the group of the Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The advantages of the antimicrobial coating according to
      invention and/or. Surface refinement essentially consist of the
      subsequent points:<br>
      <br>
      1. Very high hydrophobie and Oleophobiewerte, more comparable with
      the values of coatings, which become generated by means of
      fluorine carbon resins. Thus an extreme strong antiadhesive
      effect, which still exceeds those of the ptfe, goes it becomes
      contact angles of 139,5 deg. achieved (Institut high stone). This
      is favourable, in order to prevent the Erstbesiedlung of the
      surfaces by microorganisms, which test before the settlement of
      the substrate by the delivery of a tacky secretion quasi whether
      the surface for a settlement is suitable. Since this secretion on
      the oleophoben surface remains hardly clinging, it does not come
      only at all in many cases to a settlement and into sequence to a
      colony formation.<br>
      <br>
      2. The very good adhesive coating can be laid on because of the
      very good ductile properties on substrates of most different
      geometry and nature.<br>
      <br>
      3. The SiO2-Matrix (glass) is very abrasion-stable and is
      characterised by not measurable abrasion and one much high
      hardness. Due to the ultradünnen layers of &lt; the glass layer
      their very good flexible properties keeps 250 Nm.<br>
      <br>
      4. The immobilization of the antimicrobial active ingredients the
      prevented elution and dilution of the active ingredients and thus
      removing the antibacterial activity.<br>
      <br>
      5. The coating composition consists of non-toxic compounds, which
      are more degradable biological. Silicates like the SiO2 are the
      most frequently occurring compounds of the earth's crust.<br>
      <br>
      6. With most different fabrics Waschversuche became the
      determination of the permanence of the coating performed. A
      requirement of the textile industry became after a resistance to
      washing of &gt; 50 laundries continuous achieved, provided that
      the substrate is not likewise after this number of washing
      processes degradiert.<br>
      <br>
      7. By the mixture of most different antimicrobial substances a
      broadband Antimikrobiotikum can become prepared that suitable is
      to fight also strong heterogeneous populations. The prescription
      can become the respective ambienten requests adapted. Like that it
      is possible, particular prescriptions for fabrics, for
      hygiene-sensitive surfaces in hospitals to manufacture for
      breathing air filters or for aquatic environments and to obtain
      thus the optimum growth blockade. Training of resistances becomes
      more other (e.g. MRSA) prevented.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Other subject-matter of the invention is a coating of the
      aforementioned type as coating for hard surfaces, in particular as
      Antifouling means.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Object of the invention is it likewise to make a novel
      Antifouling coating available which overcomes the disadvantages
      comparable coatings to the state of the art, hydraulic and
      oleophobe properties exhibits, so that an effective protection of
      endangered surfaces before adhesion of biopolymers and
      microorganisms, with simultaneous indulgence of the environment
      is, ensured and the abrasion-stable for a lasting protection and
      thus is wasserunbelastend.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] This object becomes according to invention dissolved by the
      fact that the surfaces a polymerized SiO2 - matrix exhibits into
      which antimicrobial active ingredients and/or metal oxides are
      storable, whereby these active ingredients not eluierbar and
      immobilized is applicable into the SiO2-Matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The coating is due to their polymerized SiO2 matrix
      glass-similar. With use in moved waters from this an high
      hydrodynamic efficiency, which leads to an effective self
      cleaning, results. By the SiO2 matrix is the coating furthermore
      abrasion-stable, scratching and scheuerfest.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] This is the use of the coating composition of the
      aforementioned type as Antifouling means for with water, in
      particular with sea and sea water in compound standing surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] An other object of the invention concerns therefore the use
      of the coating for with water, in particular with sea and sea
      water in compound standing surfaces to the protection before
      Biofouling causing biopolymers and/or microorganisms as well as a
      method to the preparation of a such coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Surfaces in aquatic habitats are the formation of tacky
      biopolymers exposed, which introduce a Biofoulingprozess. Bottom
      Biofouling understands one the deposition of living organisms on
      material surfaces in aqueous environment, which their physical
      surface properties negative affect. Each Foulingprozess in the
      water starts with the attachment of organic molecules at a
      surface. Its solidification the possible other settlement of
      bacteria, Diatomeen, shells and cancers etc. In marine environment
      experiences each surface Biofouling, which leads to one of the
      largest problems with the surfaces in the marine technology.
      Particular surface coatings, “Antifouling coatings so mentioned”,
      are to prevent the vegetation at hulls, sea water constructions,
      oil platforms, harbor facilities and tubes, as well as at other
      artificial underwater structures. It is known, hulls, to provide
      oil platforms and harbor facilities with Antifouling coatings.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The TRGS516 (technical rules for dangerous materials,
      Antifouling, output 1996) shows the conditions of the
      safety-relevant, as well as ergonomical requests according to
      industrial medicine and hygienic to dangerous materials regarding
      Inverkehrbringen and handling. It regulates the use of very toxic,
      toxic and Antifouling colors injurious to health. Known
      Antifouling coatings are based either on forms of the mechanical
      purification or on the discharged one of toxic biocides from
      matrix coatings or on a combination of both. The mechanical
      purification strong slippery surfaces become generated by the use
      of Teflons or silicone in the coating, which prevent the
      attachment of Foulingstoffen.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In addition one differentiates between insoluble and
      soluble coatings. The insoluble Antifouling coatings exhibit an
      high abrasion resistance, soluble Antifouling coatings are eroding
      and become from flowing water slow removed. Known Antifouling
      coatings prevent the settlement phase of the Foulingprozesses by
      their biocides.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In that DE 101 17 945 becomes a Antifouling coating a
      without biocide described, which biomimetisch as dual
      Kompositsystem, constructed with cleaning, an hydrodynamic very
      smooth, a nano-structured surface pore size defined in form of of
      a pore-formed component with, which I after the particle size of
      tacky dirt particles arranges, and a pore-filling component, which
      exhibit gel-formed desert hydrophobic, the adhesive properties of
      the adhesive biopolymers adapted properties.<br>

      H-Pyrrole-3-Carbonitril.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] EP 1,457,531 A1 describes likewise a Antifouling
      composition on the base of a metalliferous copolymer and the
      active ingredient 4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one.<br>
      <br>

      and a copper salt of 2-Pyridinthiol-1 as effective compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] EP 64 66 30 describes a coating composition, which contains
      several Antifouling means as essential components or and or
      several copolymers, the available is from a monomer mixture,
      comprising monomer A of the formula (1)<br>

      selected from alkyl groups, cycloalkyl groups and aryl groups, and
      which can be identical or from each other various, and X is a

      is, Y a Aryloyloxygruppe, a Methacryloyloxylgruppe, a
      Maleinoyloxylgruppe or a Fumaroyloxygruppe and a n is a whole
      number from 1 to 25, and the amount of the Antifoulingmittels
      amounts to 0.1 to 80 Gew % on base of the weight of the solid
      content of the coating composition.<br>
      <br>
      With the biocides one differentiates between “metal-organic
      biocides”, like arsenics, coppers and Tributylzinn, and “natural
      biocides”, with which many marine organisms themselves protect
      their surface from Biofouling. They can antialgalen as biogenous
      active ingredients antibacterially, work antifungisch and
      makrofoulingverhindernd. However the need grows at altogether
      non-toxic vegetation protection methods due to stricter
      legislation<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The antimicrobial active ingredients, like chitosan, 2.4.4
      ' Trichlor-2' hydroxy more diphenylether and quaternary ammonium
      salts prevent the effective settlement of surfaces of the support
      material by bacteria, funguses, viruses, algae, Diatomeen, shells
      and cancers in air environment, aqueous environment and air water
      systems, work thus antibacterially, antifungal, fungicidal,
      algizid and virozid.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The Antifouling coating is water and environmentalneutral.
      It is simple in the processing and can by spraying (aerosol) or
      capers on the surfaces applied become. By storing the active
      ingredients into the SiO2-Matrix they cannot be washed dissolved
      or. Furthermore it is favourable that your effectiveness does not
      decrease over the time.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Further it is of advantage to bring metal oxides for
      example to Al2O3 and/or TiO2 into the SiO2 matrix. This
      Antifouling coating according to invention is characterised with
      it by a strong hydrophobische and oleophobische effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] One with the Antifouling coating according to invention
      treated surface represents a very poor clamping coat situation for
      polymers and/or for microorganisms, so that hardly colonies can
      form, biostatic active ingredients is antimicrobial acting
      substances, with whose contact the microorganisms adjust their
      growth. Beyond that it exhibits a thickness within the nanometer
      range and is acidic one and caustic solutions opposite very
      stable. Teflonhaltige and/or fluorcarbonhaltige or silikonhaltige
      coatings, which are to cause an attaching of microorganisms due to
      their smooth surface, are only hydrophobic ones, not however
      oleophob, partially even oleophilic, so that microorganisms on the
      oil-wetted surfaces can quite settle and take place
      Biofoulingprozesse. Beyond that these coatings are not
      abrasion-stable and are subject therefore to strong wear. In the
      processing these coatings likewise critical are to be evaluated,
      since they contain alcohol-based solvents.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Metal-organic coatings, which contain arsenics, coppers, or
      Tributylzinn, are water-getting biocide dirty, strong and thus
      strong polluting. Furthermore Tributylzinn haltige colors are in
      the USA since 01.06.2005 even forbidden. Beyond that these not
      abrasion-stable coatings are eroding and become by flowing water
      removed. The active ingredients increased in the food chain are
      found to biocides up to the humans and are to a considerable
      degree harmful for the humans and the environment, thereby.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The nanoskalige Antifouling coating on SiO2-Basis however
      the satisfied requirement after both hydrophobic and oleophober
      effect. Microorganisms cling only very heavier on this surface and
      can form so hardly colonies. By the complexation of the
      polymerized SiO2-Schicht by means of antibacterial chemicals a not
      eluierbares Antifouling becomes generated, which is water-neutral.<br>

      <br>
      [0057] An other object of the invention is it to make available a
      coating as well as methods to the protection before moisture of
      packages, like cardboard boxes on paper and sticking basis, like
      also on base of fabrics and tissues of most different type, before
      rains, snows, condensed water, sea water, extreme high relative
      humidity and microorganisms, with simultaneous retention of the
      breathing activity (diffusible) on the base of ultradünnen
      SiO2-Beschichtungen and simultaneous antimicrobial protection, as
      well as a method for this.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Packages, like cardboard boxes serve all type as waterproof
      package of goods and goods, in order to ensure as safe a transport
      of the cargo as possible, i.e. one strives to a Antifouling
      coating to reach.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Here the package is not only to protect the content against
      damages mechanical type, but the package is to protect the cargo
      also against impairment by waters or moisture. The cargoes are
      moisture of most different type, like e.g. Rain, snow, condensed
      water, sea water, extreme high relative humidity or wet pile
      documents, exposed. Moisten or wet-damaged cardboard boxes e.g.
      suffer depreciations. by linear deformations, twist features,
      changes in evenness and color, reduction of the mechanical tear
      strength and. With the storage in the stack a
      Feuchtigkeitsüberschuss leads to swelling the fibers in the edge
      portions thereby among other things in their edges the wavy can.
      These damages are irreversible, there it with the later drying
      process to forgiven due to internal stresses with uneven
      distribution of the moisture within the sheet and for spotting
      (edges of drying) come. Charge sweat can particularly with travels
      from cold to warm and/or. with the deletion in tropical ports
      develop, if the good did not become sufficient heated during the
      journey and e.g. when opening the hatchways and/or. Container
      doors of the warm ambient air exposed becomes. A certain breathing
      activity is quite desired with some packages, if e.g. Products
      packaged become, which deliver moisture after packing still. In
      the range of the Pharma and medical technology industry some
      products e.g. become. warm and wet packaged. It exists thus the
      need at packages, which are in the layer, to deliver moisture from
      the inside outward simultaneous however from the outside inward
      waterproof is.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] It is thus provided cardboard boxes on the outside with PL
      coatings (PE) too known, packages, in order to prevent the
      penetration of water in the form of rains, snows, condensed water,
      sea water, extreme high relative humidity or wet pile documents
      into the package. Simultaneous one however the prevented PL
      coating the diffusion of moisture, z. B. that residual moisture of
      the product which can be packed arrives, from the inside outward.
      From the outside applied PL coating works the moisture in and at
      the cardboard box condensed in this place like a vapor barrier. By
      the moisture absorption the stability of the carton, in particular
      from the inside becomes significant affected in the first 3-5
      days. During this time the frequency of the TUL processes in such
      a way specified (transport, envelope, storage) is highest. Damages
      at the carton are preprogrammed thereby which has immense costs
      for remedy to the sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Condensed water molecules are approx. 700-mal larger as
      vaporous water molecules, is called water vapor is in the layer by
      the coating to be diffused. Condensed molecules are substantial
      larger and become thus at the surface retained. The coating is
      glassy due to the polymerized SiO2-Matrix and favourable-proves
      thereby very abrasion-stable, acid and caustic solution-stable as
      well as scratch-proof.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Object of the invention is it to create a novel packing
      coating those the disadvantages of the polyethylene coating (vapor
      barrier) prevented, simultaneous wasserundurchlässige and
      breathe-active properties exhibits, hydrophobic and simultaneous
      oleophob and antimicrobial is and the so inexpensive number of the
      damages reduced and but ensures that packages even multiple used
      to become to be able.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] This object becomes dissolved by the use of the coating
      composition of the before-described type on/in packages, like
      cardboard boxes on paper and sticking basis, as also on base of
      fabrics and tissues and Gewirken.<br>

      [0103] Subsequent ones were submitted the cardboard plates to an
      antibacterial test. Again the shining bacteria test became also
      here after Dr. Prolonged to the application brought. It did not
      surprise that also with this test almost identical results were to
      be registered, like bottom fig 4 shown. Since the biological
      processes on that take place biocides coating, the nature of the
      substrate does not have any influence on the antibacterial
      activity.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0104] With various laboratory tests surprising found became that
      surfaces, which became according to claim 1 coated with
      formulations a significant reduced noise shown. It is known that
      if two materials are located in contact and thereby by outside
      excitation relative move to each other, thus Knarz and screeching
      noises or undesirable friction behavior to develop can. The stick
      slip effect, which is major responsible for such phenomena,
      becomes minimized by the coating. Bottom stick slip effect
      understands one the permanent transition about detention on
      sliding friction in a movement motion. Various oscillations
      depending upon nature of the surfaces rubbing one on the other,
      which become of the resonancable surface radiated as noise,
      develop. It is obvious that the coating functions as release layer
      between the friction partner and contributes thus to the noise
      minimization.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0108] As in embodiment described, became a polyamide fiber with
      approx. 0.80 mm diameters with the coating according to invention
      in addition, with a active substance-free coating provide and
      subsequent bent. With the fact significant is more recognizable
      that in both cases at the outer radius of the fiber no tears arise
      and develop at the inner radius of the fiber to only slight
      upsettings. The polymer structure of the SiO2-Beschichtung here
      exemplary for the fiber shown, leads ductility, elasticity and
      extensibility to properties, which are not from crystalline
      SiO2-Strukturen known, i.e. Dependent ones of the elasticity of
      the substrate are extensibilities of up to 250% more achievable.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The present invention becomes other more near explained by

      <br>
      [0111] Fig. 1 shows those much smooth surface of the coating,
      which shows at no location porosity. The pores located in the
      fiber become covered by the coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Fig. likewise the very smooth surface structure of the
      coating shows 2, as well as complete coating of the round fiber.
      Only the smooth surface in compound with one much low surface
      tension creates the hydrophobic and oleophoben properties, which
      contribute to the fact that the Erstbesiedlung is made more
      difficult by microorganisms. There is numerous microorganisms
      known, which test before the settlement of the substrate by the
      delivery of a tacky secretion quasi whether the surface for a
      settlement is suitable. Since this secretion on the oleophoben
      surface remains hardly clinging, it does not come only at all in
      many cases to a settlement and into sequence to a colony
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Fig. the coating shows 3 on a metal substrate out. It is
      clearer more recognizable the fact that the homogeneous layer does
      not exhibit any pores but shows a closed, dense surface.<br>

      frame of the measurement inaccuracy no growth inhibition and only
      with silicon dioxide-coated plate achieved after 60 min. a growth
      inhibition of 20% and after 140 min of 40%<br>

      [0115] Fig. a polyamide fiber with approx. shows 5. 0.80 mm
      diameters with the coating according to invention provided is and
      subsequent bent becomes. With the fact significant is more
