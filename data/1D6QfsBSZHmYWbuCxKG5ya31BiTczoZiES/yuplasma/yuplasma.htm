      COLUMBIA, Mo. – University of Missouri engineers and their
      research collaborators at Nanova, Inc. are one step closer to a
      painless way to replace fillings. After favorable results in the
      lab, human clinical trials are underway on the “plasma brush.”<br>
      <br>
      In less than 30 seconds, the plasma brush uses chemical reactions
      to disinfect and clean out cavities for fillings. In addition to
      the bacteria-killing properties, the “cool flame” from the plasma
      brush forms a better bond for cavity fillings.&nbsp; The chemical
      reactions involved with the plasma brush actually change the
      surface of the tooth, which allows for a strong and robust bonding
      with the filling material.<br>
      <br>
      “There have been no side effects reported during the lab trials,
      and we expect the human trials to help us improve the prototype,”
      said Qingsong Yu, associate professor of mechanical and aerospace
      engineering of MU, and Meng Chen, chief scientist from Nanova,
      Inc., which holds a co-patent for the plasma brush with MU.<br>
      <br>
      “200 million tooth restorations cost Americans an estimated $50
      billion a year, and it is estimated that replacement fillings
      comprise 75 percent of a dentist’s work. The plasma brush would
      help reduce those costs,” said Hao Li, associate professor of
      mechanical and aerospace engineering in the MU College of
      Engineering. “In addition, a tooth can only support two or three
      restorations before it must be pulled. Our studies indicate that
      fillings are 60 percent stronger with the plasma brush, which
      would increase the filling lifespan. This would be a big benefit
      to the patient, as well as dentists and insurance companies.”<br>
      <br>
      The research and development team also includes Yong Wang from the
      School of Dentistry at University of Missouri-Kansas City and
      Liang Hong from the School of Dentistry at University of
      Tennessee-Memphis. The project has been funded by the National
      Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. Li,
      along with Yu and Chen, have formed Nanova, Inc., with Chen
      leading the plasma brush device development through the NIH Small
      Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.<br>
      <br>
      Human clinical trials are expected to begin in early 2012 at the
      University of Tennessee-Memphis. The researchers believe the human
      clinical trials will provide the data that allow Nanova to find
      investors and take the next steps in placing the product on the
      market. If the studies go well and the FDA clears the use, the
      researchers’ timeline indicates the plasma brush could be
      available to dentists as early as the end of 2013.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> --&nbsp; The
      provision of dental restorations can be improved by generating a
      cold atmospheric plasma inside the mouth of the patient and then
      applying that cold atmospheric plasma onto a dental restoration
      site. The dental restoration site can be composed of either or
      both of dentin and enamel. Further, the provision of dental
      restorations can also be improved by introducing a dental adhesive
      onto a dental restoration site and treating it with a cold
      atmospheric plasma.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The present disclosure relates to dental cavity repair and
      treatment. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a
      surface treatment method for targeted dentin and dental materials
      using a cold atmospheric discharge plasma technique to improve the
      clinical performance and durability of dental restorations.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Dental fillings are commonly used to treat dental cavities
      resulting from caries. Caries is the formal name for the disease
      that causes tooth decay or the formation of what are commonly
      referred to as cavities. Caries causes tooth decay resulting in
      decayed matter forming in the tooth, the location of the decayed
      matter often being referred to as a cavity. As many know, the
      tooth has an enamel outer layer that covers a thicker layer of
      dentin. The enamel protects the dentin, and in turn, the dentin
      protects the pulp of the tooth that contains flesh, including
      sensitive nerves. Failure of the enamel and the dentin to protect
      the pulp, whether from accident or caries, is a toothache.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] To treat caries, the decayed matter in the cavities needs
      be removed and the cavities are disinfected and filled. The
      removal of the decayed matter is usually performed by a dental
      drill. The materials for the filling are most commonly dental
      amalgam or composite material. Conventionally, an adhesive is used
      to firmly connect the tooth to the filling. Adhesives are also
      used for crowns and caps. A generic term that encompasses
      fillings, crowns, caps and other structures installed in a tooth
      to remedy a defect in the tooth is restorations.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Also, one restoration is being replaced with another
      restoration can be performed. Such replacement is sometimes, but
      not always, accompanied by the presence of additional decay that
      needs removal. The prior restoration will usually be removed in
      the course of this work, sometimes by drilling, but also by other
      means in situations such as where a crown or a cap is being
      removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The tooth may be formed to have a recess in the tooth, as
      is common for dental fillings. But the tooth may also be formed
      into a post or the like, such as when caps are installed.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Where the surfaces of the tooth, adhesive and filling meet
      each other are called interfaces. For a properly installed filling
      there is an interface between tooth and adhesive and an interface
      between adhesive and filling. Fillings have high failure rates at
      these interfaces and often need to be replaced later.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Failure is particularly prominent in composite dental
      materials. Composite restoration has become the preferred form of
      restorative material because of patients' aesthetic requirements
      and the aversion of patients and dentists to the potential health
      risk of mercury release from dental amalgams. But composite
      restorations do not last as long as dental amalgams. Some of the
      reasons for premature failures of composite restoration include
      dental composite shrinkage, inadequate bonding of the adhesive to
      dentin, and formation of a second cavity at the edges of or under
      the restoration.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Recent studies show that many recorded filling failures
      occur at the tooth-adhesive interface. These failures are caused
      by the failure of the adhesive bonding attaching the filling
      material/composite to the dentin of the tooth. One study has
      reported that about 70% of composite restoration failures at the
      back of the mouth occur at the dentin-composite interface. The
      failure of the adhesive to maintain bonding results in the
      separation of the composite restoration from dentin. The resulting
      gaps lead to staining at the margins of the restoration,
      sensitivity, and recurrent caries, which cause a significant
      portion of composite restoration removal and replacements.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Studies also show that adhesion between enamel and
      composite is generally adequate for clinical applications, while
      adhesive/dentin bonds are the weak link and the interfacial bond
      strength in the composite restoration deteriorates significantly
      over time. The disruption of the bonded interface can develop as a
      consequence of long-term thermal and mechanical stresses, or
      during the restorative procedure itself, due to stresses generated
      by composite polymer shrinkage.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Foods and saliva are perpetually in the mouth, and further,
      bacteria are always present. These can cause problems for the
      adhesive working to maintain bonding at the restoration-dentin
      interface. Unsuccessful dentin bonding also means that there are
      sites at the tooth restoration interface that are vulnerable to
      hydrolytic breakdown and susceptible to attack by bacterial
      enzymes. Clinical performance needs to improve when polymer-based
      dental composites are to be considered viable alternative to
      dental amalgam. The desired improvements include enhancing the
      bonding strength at the adhesive/dentin interface to resist
      polymerization shrinkage and to make it impervious to oral fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Currently, the preparation and disinfection of dental
      cavities (dentin surfaces) prior to filling relies on mechanical
      drilling or laser techniques to remove dead (synonymous with
      necrotic), infected, and non-remineralizable tissue. Both methods
      are often destructive and can be painful for patients due to
      mechanical stimulation (vibration) and heating of the dental
      nerve. To ensure sufficient disinfection, an excess healthy tissue
      must be removed using the current methods, since dentine contains
      many small channels in which bacteria can hide. Moreover, the
      disinfection process itself, with the current methods, can also
      lead to fracture of dentin.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Several studies and techniques for the
      preparation/disinfection process have been attempted to improve
      the interface bonding strength, but with only limited success. For
      example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,172,130 describes surface treatment of
      dental prosthesis composed of polymers containing hydrogen atoms
      using gas phase plasma in a vacuumed reactor vessel operated at
      13.56 MHz. The plasma treated polymers are characterized by the
      hydrogen atoms on the surface of the polymer being partially
      replaced by fluorine atoms. The type of modified polymers is
      claimed to be able to improve the retention of the prosthesis
      and/or limit the development of dental plaque. However, this
      plasma process, due to its requirement of reduced-pressure
      environment, is not suitable for surface treatment of the dentin
      of living subjects in dental clinics.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Therefore, there is a need to develop a new and improved
      preparation/disinfection method employing the cold atmospheric
      plasma technology, which can chemically activate dentin surface to
      implement chemical bonding and enhance adhesion strength at
      dentin-composite interfaces, and consequently to increase the
      longevity of dental restorations, as well as to be more
      cost-effective and less painful to patients.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0016] A method of surface treatment for providing a dental
      restoration can include generating a cold atmospheric plasma
      inside the mouth of the patient and then applying that cold
      atmospheric plasma onto a dental restoration site. The dental
      restoration site can be composed of either or both of dentin and
      enamel. Also, the surface of dental adhesive present after
      introducing a dental adhesive onto a tooth can also constitute a
      dental restoration site that can be beneficially treated with a
      cold atmospheric plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The dental restoration can also have a surface of dental
      composite layers. The temperature of the cold atmospheric plasma
      can range from about 10[deg.] C. to about 50[deg.] C. with
      temperatures of about 35[deg.] C. to about 39[deg.] C. being
      preferred for patient comfort in most applications. The gas that
      is excited into the cold atmospheric plasma can be helium, argon,
      nitrogen, oxygen, nitrous oxide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, water
      vapor, air, gaseous hydrocarbons, gaseous silicon-carbons, gaseous
      fluorocarbons or mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Also, the atmospheric plasma can be applied to the
      restoration site for a period of about 10 seconds to a period of
      about 2 minutes. In addition to measuring exposure by a fixed time
      interval, the method contemplates the atmospheric plasma being
      applied to the restoration site for a period of time that enhances
      the strength of the adhesive-site interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The cold atmospheric plasma appears to be most beneficial
      to the periphery of a dental restoration site.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] This disclosure also contemplates a method of installing a
      dental restoration on a tooth inside of a patient's mouth where
      material is removed from a tooth to expose a surface comprising
      dentin or enamel. The exposed surface is then treated with a
      dentally acceptable acid to clean it, and then the acid is removed
      to stop the acid-tooth reaction. Then cold atmospheric plasma is
      generated inside the mouth of the patient and applied onto the
      exposed surface. Then a dental adhesive is applied to the surface.
      Optionally the cold atmospheric plasma can be applied to the
      adhesive-coated surface. Then a dental restoration can be
      installed on the adhesive coated surface.<br>

      <br>
      [0028] Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific
      terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by
      one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.
      All publications, patent applications, patents, and other

      <br>
      [0029] The present disclosure reveals a new and improved surface
      treatment method using cold atmospheric plasma brush technology
      that can be used in dental restoration for dental cavity
      treatment, preparation, and surface modification of related dental
      fillings. The disclosed treatments can be safely used inside the
      mouth of a patient without causing more pain than is common to
      standard dental work. The surface treatment method can be employed
      in any surface to activate chemical bonding effect, particularly
      the surfaces of a dental filling site in a dental restoration,
      such as dentin surface, dental enamel surface, dental-adhesive
      surface, and dental-filling surface. The method for surface
      treatment at a dental restoration site during a dental restoration
      can include generating cold atmospheric plasma at an appropriate
      temperature and directing the plasma jet onto a desired surface at
      the dental restoration site for duration sufficient to change the
      surface characteristics in ways that facilitate bonding of the
      treated site with adhesives.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Cold plasmas, or low-temperature gas plasmas, are partially
      ionized gases that contain highly reactive particles including
      electronically excited atoms, molecules, ionic and free radical
      species, while the gas phase remains near room temperature.
      Depending on the plasma chemistry or gas composition, these highly
      reactive plasma species clean, and etch surface materials, bond to
      various substrates, or combine to form a nanoscale thin layer of
      plasma coating, and consequently alter the surface
      characteristics. These non-equilibrium plasmas combine exceptional
      chemical activity with relatively mild, non-destructive
      characteristics due to the room-temperature gas phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The cold atmospheric plasma can comprise plasma gases of
      helium, argon, nitrogen, oxygen, nitrous oxide, ammonia, carbon
      dioxide, water vapor, air, gaseous hydrocarbons, gaseous
      fluorocarbons, gaseous silicon-carbons, and mixtures of them.
      Desirably, the temperature of the plasma can range from about 20
      to about 50[deg.] C., with about 37+-2[deg.] C. as preferred. The
      surface of the desired dental filling site can be the surface of a
      dentin, the surface of dental enamel, the surface of a dental
      adhesive, or the surface of a dental filling. The term, "adhesive"
      or "dental adhesive" refers to a composition used on a dental
      structure (e.g., a tooth) to adhere a restoration material to it.

      [0032] Cold plasma surface treatments, when employed to modify the
      surface of the dentine, can increase adhesive penetration into
      collagen fibrils leading to a more effective hybrid layer and
      increasing chemical bonding between the collage fibrils and the
      dental adhesive. The plasma can also act as a primer for the
      collagen fibers. Low temperature plasmas in particular, when
      modifying polymers for adhesion, can be tailored to reduce the
      negative effects seen with other preparatory methods such as
      surface roughening, wet chemical treatments, or exposure to
      flames.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Dentin is largely a matrix of hydroxyapatite having fibrils
      of collagen distributed within the hydroxyapatite. While not
      wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that when utilized
      correctly and efficiently cold plasma is a gentle method used to
      increase the wettability of the topmost layer of polymeric
      surfaces, such as collagen fibrils, without negatively affecting
      the underlying material. Plasma can also uniquely tailor the
      surface of polymeric materials by addition of reactive gases in
      small quantities, which permits the plasma to easily modify and
      enhance the surface characteristics of various types of adhesives.
      Additionally, cold atmospheric plasma is a good candidate to
      sterilize the surface of surgical instrumentation to prevent
      bacterial infection, which in turn decreases the chance of the
      composite failing because of the formation of secondary caries.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The inventive surface treatment method for a dental filling
      site includes the steps of 1) generating cold atmospheric plasma
      at a pre-determined temperature, and 2) directing the plasma onto
      a desired surface at the dental filling site for duration
      sufficient to change the surface characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] FIG. 1, is a schematic illustration of a typical dental
      plasma brush and related power supply. The plasma brush device 10
      contains a plasma brush generator 12 that includes a walled,
      narrow gas chamber 14 and two electrodes 16 &amp; 18, which are
      located inside the gas chamber 14. The hot wire electrode 16 is
      connected to an optional ballasted resistor 20 that can be used to
      restrain the discharge current coming from the external power
      source 22. The grounded electrode 18 is connected to ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] A working gas 24 can be introduced into the gas chamber 14.
      When electrical power is applied through the electrodes 16 &amp;
      18, the gas in the gas chamber 14 is excited. A glow discharge
      plasma 26 of the gas flowing through the plasma generator will be
      formed. The discharge plasma 26 will exit through a nozzle 28,
      which can be disposable for control of hygiene.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The electrodes can be powered by an external power source
      22. The atmospheric pressure plasma can be generated and
      maintained by electric power input from a direct current or
      alternating current, audio or radio frequency, or pulsed power
      supplies. The working gas 24 can be helium, argon, nitrogen,
      oxygen, nitrous oxide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, water vapor, air,
      gaseous hydrocarbons, gaseous fluorocarbons, gaseous
      silicon-carbons, and mixtures thereof. Argon or air is preferred
      in certain dental applications, such as enhancement of bonding
      strength in dental restoration, or disinfection of dental
      bacteria. The duration of each surface treatment varies depending
      upon the particular application, but commonly run less than 60
      seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] A nozzle 28 is used to direct the flow of the discharge
      plasma out of the gas chamber 14. The nozzle 28 can be in any
      shape. For example, the exit from the nozzle 28 can be round, oval
      or square, or other desirable shape. Additionally, it is desirable
      for the shape of the gas chamber 14 to complement the shape of the
      nozzle 28.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] One operable shape is a nozzle 28 that is relatively narrow
      in a first direction generally perpendicular to the flow of gas
      and relatively wide in a second direction transverse to the first
      direction but still generally perpendicular to the flow of gas.
      Such a nozzle 28 forms plasma with a brush-like shape at the exit
      of the chamber. Operatively, when the nozzle 28 forms a brush of
      plasma, the gas chamber 14 is dimensioned slit-like to complement
      the nozzle 28.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] While the plasma brush would be operable without a
      ballasted resistor 20, glow-to-arc transitions can be prevented by
      a ballasted resistor 20 and working gas 24 appropriate to the
      narrow slit chamber design. The brush-like shaped plasma extends
      beyond the exit of the chamber, and possesses there active
      features of low-pressure or non-equilibrium plasmas. The resultant
      low-pressure or non-equilibrium gasses can be used to treat
      surfaces of dentin, enamel, adhesive, or dental composite layer
      for dental composite filling.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Further information on the plasma brush are incorporated by
      reference as if fully set forth herein from Y. X. Duan, C. Huang,
      Q. S. Yu, 2005, "Low-temperature direct current glow discharges at
      atmospheric pressure", IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science, 33, p.
      328-329.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The plasma can be directed to the surface of dentin,
      enamel, dental adhesives, or dental fillings. FIG. 2(a) is a side
      view facing a broad aspect 30 of the plasma brush 32. The width of
      the plasma brush is desirably in the range of 1 to 10 mm. The
      diagram shows the plasma to be safe to apply to a human finger 34,
      which can be readily done. FIG. 2(b) shows a side view facing the
      narrow aspect 36 of the plasma "brush." The narrow aspect 36 of
      the plasma brush 32 has a thickness of about 1-5 mm, and is
      desirable in the range of 1 to 3 mm. A ruler 38 is also shown
      indicating a length 40 for the plasma brush 32 of about 5 mm, and
      is desirable in the range of 5 to 12 mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] When employing the atmospheric plasma brush, the size and
      temperature of the plasma can be easily controlled by varying the
      plasma input power mainly through adjusting the electrical current
      to the electrodes and gas flow rate passing the plasma chamber.
      The desired temperature of the plasma ranges from about 20 to
      about 50[deg.] C. A plasma temperature of about 37+-2[deg.] C. is
      preferred for work in humans. It should be noted that the
      temperature can be adjusted to suit the comfort of a particular
      patient or other species of animal.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 3 is a graph showing various plasma temperatures under
      different generating conditions. Line 42 denotes the thermocouple
      temperature (Y-axis) as a function of power source wattage at a
      constant flow of argon gas at 2000 standard cubic centimeters per
      minute (sccm). Line 44 shows the same at a flow rate of 3000 sccm,
      line 46 at 4000 sccm, and line 48 at 5000 sccm. Thermocouple, IR
      imaging, and thermometers, when used in correlation, can be used
      to provide a reasonable range of the plasma temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The plasma temperature profile of the described atmospheric
      plasma brush was established by taking thermal IR images. In
      comparison with the plasma temperatures measured using a
      thermocouple, it was noted that an average of 5[deg.] C. higher
      temperature was recorded using the IR imaging method. The nerve
      system of human teeth is very sensitive to temperature
      differences. The results of the thermal imaging study indicate
      that the plasma temperature of the plasma brush can be well
      controlled to be close to human body temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The duration of treatment can vary from 5 seconds to 10
      minutes. The preferred treatment time will be in the range of 10
      seconds to 2 minutes and the most preferred range will be in the
      range of 10 seconds to 60 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In a particular application, dentin surfaces were treated
      by argon plasma brush at room temperature for 0, 30, 100, and 300
      sec. Adper Single Bond Plus dental adhesive (3M ESPE) and Filtek
      Z250 composite (3M ESPE) were applied and light cured as directed.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIG. 4 shows the Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrum
      change of dentin surface before plasma treatment 50 and after
      plasma treatment 52. The FTIR spectrum change after plasma
      treatment shows that there is a significant chemical change on the
      dentin surface. One change is the increase of carbonyl groups
      present at the surface, shown in area 54, which can contribute, in
      part, to the enhancement of the bonding strength at
      dentin-composite interfaces. While not wishing to be bound by
      theory, the formation of more carbonyl groups on the collagen
      fibers can increase hydrogen bonding between adhesive and fiber.
      These additional functional groups also can permit the collagen
      fibers to disaggregate after rewetting because of the electrical
      repulsive forces, which can significantly increase the surface
      area of the collagen fibers and in turn the bonding strength of
      the collagen fibers to adhesives.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] This can be understood in view of the composition of
      representative collagens and adhesives. Type I collagen is one
      type of collagen present in dentin. Type I collagen is generally
      about [1/3] glycine and [1/6] proline or hydroxyproline. Lysine,
      hydroxylysine, and histidine are generally involved in
      cross-linking type I collagen molecules into fibrils. ADPER SINGLE
      BOND PLUS is a representative dental adhesive. ADPER SINGLE BOND
      PLUS comprises BisGMA, dimethacrylates, HEMA, VITREBOND
      polyalkenoic acid copolymer, water, ethanol, and silica
      nanoparticles. All of these can have hydrogen bonding with the
      recited components of Type I collagen.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Dentin collagen has 3 times the hydroxylysine as skin
      collagen. When treated with HEMA and glutaraldehyde only 18% of
      the lysine and 15% of the hydroxylysine are cross-linked. Steric
      hindrance prevents more than 80% of the free amino acids from
      interacting with the adhesive. As a result, opportunities for
      hydrogen bonding are severely reduced in a collagen fiber as
      compared to the separate parts of a collagen molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] While not wishing to be bound by theory, the plasma is
      thought to disaggregate the triple helix. The result of the
      disaggregation can be that the amino acids that were held in the
      interior of the triple helix are exposed by breaking up the triple
      helix. Not only does this result in more amino acids being
      exposed, it increases the surface area exposed for adhesion by
      taking surface area that was on the inside of a fiber, and making
      that surface area available for adhesion.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The techniques of the present disclosure result in an
      increase in the ultimate tensile strength for the dentin-composite
      bond induced by plasma treatment of dentin-composite interfaces at
      the margins of the interfaces. The increase of carbonyl groups on
      plasma treated dentin surfaces shown in the FTIR implies the
      treatment effect is due to the reactive species in the plasma
      rather than the heat produced from the plasma brush. Both heat
      treated and plasma treated surfaces show an amide II shift. In
      other words, plasma treatment did induce chemical structural
      changes on the collagen fibrils, which determines the final
      interfacial bonding strength of dental composite restorations.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Furthermore, the plasma treatment at the dental filling
      site provides additional disinfection effects besides improving
      bonding strength. FIG. 5 shows the plasma treatment effects on
      cell survival curves of Streptococcus mutans, the most common
      bacterium causing dental cavity. The Y-axis of FIG. 5 is the
      Y-axis of colony-forming unit (CFU), a measure of viable bacterial
      numbers, and the X-axis is the treatment time with argon at a flow
      rate of 2000 sccm. Line 56 represents the results at 5 W of power,
      line 58 at 10 W of power and line 60 at 15 W of power. The results
      shown in FIG. 5 demonstrate that plasma treatment can also
      effectively and rapidly disinfect bacteria in the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0054] An atmospheric cold plasma brush (ACPB), a non-thermal gas
      plasma source, was used to treat and prepare dentin surfaces for
      dental adhesive and dental composite application. Extracted
      unerupted human third molars were used for this investigation. The
      occlusal one-third of the crown was sectioned by means of a
      water-cooled low speed diamond saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, Ill.).
      The exposed dentin surfaces were polished with 600 grit SiC sand
      papers under water and then etched using 36% phosphoric acid.
      Dentin surfaces were Ar plasma treated for 0, 30, 60, and 300 sec.
      A flow rate of 2500 sccm and a power of 5 watts were chosen. The
      results of these treatments are shown in FIG. 6. Oxygen additions
      at various flow rates were also tested. Adper Single Bond Plus
      dental adhesive (3M ESPE) and Filtek Z250 composite (3M ESPE) were
      applied and light cured as directed. Dentin/composite bars (8-10
      mm*1 mm*1 mm) were cut from the prepared teeth for tensile testing
      and interface characterization. The chemical structural changes of
      the plasma treated dentins were characterized by FTIR. Fracture
      surfaces were characterized by SEM (Philips XL30 ESEM-FEG).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] When plasma treatment was not used, the strength of a
      dentin-adhesive interface was 36.8+-10.5 Mpa. But 30 seconds of
      plasma treatment on the dentin surface increased the tensile
      strength of the dentin/adhesive interface of peripheral dentin to
      60.4+-15.7 Mpa. These findings were confirmed with SEM. The notion
      of peripheral dentin is understood in the art. One definition is
      given by viewing the tooth from above. If the dentin is above
      pulp, it is central and the remaining area is peripheral. It can
      also be understood as being the most peripheral 1 to 2 mm or so of
      the tooth. The SEM observations show increased areas of composite
      on the fracture surface when compared to the untreated control
      samples. It was found that numerous plasma treated samples failed
      in locations other than the dentin/adhesive interface, while most
      of the control samples failed at the interface. The periphery is
      an area that in a particular planned or installed restoration is
      most exposed to the contents of the mouth, including, but not
      limited to, saliva, bacteria and food.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 2</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0056] SEM images shown in FIGS. 7(a)-(d) have been taken of the
      fracture surfaces that can be generated using methods of this
      disclosure. FIGS. 7(a)-(d) represent back scattered SEM images of
      the fracture surfaces of the test specimens prepared from: (a) the
      untreated controls (0 sec), (b) 30 sec, (c) 100 sec, and (d) 300
      sec plasma treated dentin. The resulting SEM images showed that
      more composite remained on dentin surfaces plasma treated for 30
      seconds when compared with controls. This illustrates that rather
      than the fissure occurring in the adhesive-dentin interface, the
      break occurs in the composite instead, showing that the adhesion
      of the interface is stronger than the internal strength of the
      composite.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Fracture modes were determined and recorded. Table 2

      [0058] More specimens cohesively failed in the composite for
      plasma treated specimens compared to controls, except for the
      specimens prepared from 300 s plasma treated dentin specimens.
      Control specimens had adhesive or mixed failures more frequently
      than the plasma treated specimens. SEM examination of the
      fractured cross sections showed that large amounts of
      composite/adhesive were observed on 30 s plasma treated dentin
      surfaces, which implies the dentin-adhesive interface is stronger
      than the bulk composite. These trends were also observed with the
      test specimens that gave higher tensile strength. Plasma treated
      specimens cohesively failed within the composite more frequently
      than the control specimens which also implies a stronger
      interface.<br>
