      <i>Chamtech's spray-on antenna uses a nano material to provide a
        low-power boost to antenna range. The wireless-in-a-can product
        may some day bring an end to unsightly cell towers. The antenna
        can, seen next to a closeup of the nano material.</i><i><br>

      It sounds like a particularly suspicious late-night infomercial:
      Spray your way to a better wireless signal! Improve your range!
      Save battery! Transmit over great distances under water!<br>
      <br>
      But Chamtech's spray-on antenna is a real product with some
      impressive claims. It can be sprayed on almost any surface, even
      trees and orange barrels. It doesn't suck up power. It works in a
      mysterious nanotech way.<br>
      <br>
      Here's how I imagine the antenna process goes:<br>
      <br>
      Step 1: Spray antenna material on surface.<br>
      Step 2: Connect phone to material.<br>
      Step 3: ????<br>
      Step 4: Make a phone call to the moon.<br>
      <br>
      Chamtech co-founder Anthony Sutera imagines a world where wireless
      antenna towers are replaced with nano-paint on walls, and issues
      like iPhone Antennagate are a thing of the past.<br>
      <br>
      "We have come up with a material that when you spray it on, it
      lays out just in the right pattern and all of these little
      capacitors charge and discharge extremely quickly in real time and
      they don't create any heat," Sutera says in a video presentation
      about the product.<br>
      <br>
      One of Chamtech's tests turned an RFID chip with a 5-foot range
      into an RFID chip with a 700-foot range. The company lists a spray
      antenna kit on its site, but pricing for the public is not
      revealed. The U.S. government is reportedly already playing with
      the new material.<br>
      <br>
      If all these claims bear out, then I can see everybody wanting to
      get their hands on a fresh can full of antenna. My only question
      is where in the grocery store it will be stocked: with the spray
      cheese or with the gold food paint?<br>

      </b>Wouldn't it be great if you could just pop out a can of
      spray-on antenna and boost your signal whenever it was running
      low? Chamtech Enterprises is hoping to make that dream a reality,
      and if you happen to work for the government, it already is,
      according to Chamtech's Solve for X presentation.<br>
      <br>
      Chamtech took to Google's Solve for X to show off the new
      technology. The company plans to turn its focus towards mobile
      phones and medical devices, offering a quick solution to boosting
      signals from existing antennas, or creating new ones. Chamtech's
      'antenna in a can' is far more efficient than traditional antenna
      models, offering energy savings equal to 12 times the amount of
      energy generated by solar and wind in the US annually - and it
      even works great underwater.<br>
      <br>
      A traditional antenna would require thousands of watts to send out
      a signal with a one mile range underwater. Chamtech's can do that
      with only three watts, and have a stronger signal to boot. So how
      does all of this work?<br>
      <br>
      The truth is, we don't really know. According to Chamtech's
      co-founder Anthony Sutera, he and his team came up with it in his
      living room two years ago. It works by manipulating magnetic and
      radio signals through mysterious organic materials, and you can
      spray it on any virtually any surface and hook into it with a
      flexible circuit cable.<br>
      <br>
      According to Sutera, the US government has had a lot of success
      with the technology, getting better performance out of it than
      their existing portable antennas, which he described as some of
      the best around. With the efficiency and mobility offered, it
      could even be used to rapidly deploy new infrastructure in
      disaster areas.<br>
      <br>
      Sutera and chief technology officer Rhett Spencer have coated
      their car antennas with the stuff, boasting that they can now
      listen to radio stations in Salt Lake City fifty miles away, with
      10,000-foot mountain range in between. Within a few months, they
      hope to be thinking about financing the company, and are looking
      at venture capital options to help them bring their technology to
      you.<br>
      <br>
      For his part, Spencer can't wait. “Can you imagine the
      infrastructure side of things? Telecomm under the oceans, Internet
      infrastructure, ships and satellite communications in the sea–
      they can do it out under the water.” Check out video of Chamtech's

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to techniques for a material
      used for at least one of propagation, emission and absorption of
      electromagnetic radiation. More particularly, the present
      invention relates to techniques for a conductive particle based
      material used for at least one of propagation, emission and
      absorption of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of the Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] A conventional antenna is a device with an arrangement of
      one or more conductive elements that are used to generate a
      radiating electromagnetic field in response to an applied
      alternating voltage and the associated alternating electric
      current, or can be placed in an electromagnetic field so that the
      field will induce an alternating current in the antenna and a
      voltage between its terminals. The conductive elements employed in
      the conventional antenna are typically fabricated from solid
      metallic conductors. However, the use of solid metallic conductors
      is limiting.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Therefore, a need exists for an improved material used for
      at least one of propagation, emission and absorption of
      electromagnetic radiation, and implementations of the improved
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] An aspect of the present invention is to address at least
      the above-mentioned problems and/or disadvantages and to provide
      at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of
      the present invention is to provide techniques for a conductive
      particle based material used for at least one of propagation,
      emission and absorption of electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, an
      antenna system is provided. The antenna system includes a
      substrate and an antenna. The antenna includes a conductive
      particle based material applied onto the substrate. The conductive
      particle based material includes conductive particles and a
      binder. When the conductive particle based material is applied to
      the substrate, the conductive particles are dispersed in the
      binder so that at least a majority of the conductive particles are
      adjacent to, but do not touch, one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In accordance with another aspect of the present invention,
      an antenna enhancer system is provided. The antenna enhancer
      system includes an antenna and an antenna enhancer. The antenna
      enhancer includes a conductive particle based material. The
      antenna enhancer is disposed adjacent to and offset from the
      antenna. The conductive particle based material comprises
      conductive particles and a binder. When the conductive particle
      based material is disposed adjacent to and offset from the
      antenna, the conductive particles are dispersed in the binder so
      that at least a majority of the conductive particles are adjacent
      to, but do not touch, one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In accordance with yet another aspect of the present
      invention, a method for fabricating a conformable antenna is
      provided. The method includes selecting a substrate on which to
      fabricate an antenna, selecting a template corresponding to an
      antenna design, the template comprising one or more cut out
      portions, applying a conductive particle based material, through
      the one or more cutout portions of the template, and onto the
      substrate to form the antenna, and fixing a coupler of a feed line
      to the antenna. The conductive particle based material comprises
      conductive particles and a binder. When the conductive particle
      based material is applied to the substrate, the conductive
      particles are dispersed in the binder so that at least a majority
      of the conductive particles are adjacent to, but do not touch, one
      another.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Other aspects, advantages, and salient features of the
      invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from

      surface" includes reference to one or more of such surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As used herein, the term "substantially" refers to the
      complete or nearly complete extent or degree of an action,
      characteristic, property, state, structure, item, or result. For
      example, an object that is "substantially" enclosed would mean
      that the object is either completely enclosed or nearly completely
      enclosed. The exact allowable degree of deviation from absolute
      completeness may in some cases depend on the specific context.
      However, generally speaking the nearness of completion will be so
      as to have the same overall result as if absolute and total
      completion were obtained. The use of "substantially" is equally
      applicable when used in a negative connotation to refer to the
      complete or near complete lack of an action, characteristic,
      property, state, structure, item, or result.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] As used herein, the term "about" is used to provide
      flexibility to a numerical range endpoint by providing that a
      given value may be "a little above" or "a little below" the
      endpoint.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As used herein, the term "antenna" refers to a transducer
      used to transmit or receive electromagnetic radiation. That is, an
      antenna converts electromagnetic radiation into electrical signals
      and vice versa. Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy that
      exhibits wave-like behavior as it travels through space. In free
      space, electromagnetic radiation travels close to the speed of
      light with very low transmission loss. Electromagnetic radiation
      is absorbed when propagating through a conducting material.
      However, when encountering an interface of such a material, the
      electromagnetic radiation is partially reflected and partially
      transmitted there-though. Herein, exemplary embodiments of the
      present invention described below are directed toward techniques
      that allow for a more efficient interface by reducing the
      reflections at the interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In addition, exemplary embodiments of the present invention
      described below relate to techniques for a conductive particle
      based material used for at least one of propagation, emission and
      absorption of electromagnetic radiation. While the techniques for
      the conductive particle based material may be described below in
      various specific implementations, the present invention is not
      limited to those specific implementations and is similarly
      applicable to other implementations.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] An initial overview of the conductive particle based
      material is provided below and then specific implementations in
      which the conductive particle based material is employed are
      described in detail further below. This initial overview of the
      conductive particle based material is intended to aid readers in
      understanding the conductive particle based material that is the
      basis of various exemplary implementations, but is not intended to
      identify key features or essential features of those various
      exemplary implementations, nor is it intended to limit the scope
      of the claimed subject matter.<br>

      </b><b>Conductive Particle Based Material</b><br>
      <br>
      [0031] In one exemplary embodiment, a conductive particle based
      material is employed. The conductive particle based material
      includes at least two constituent components, namely conductive
      particles and a binder. However, the conductive particle based
      material may include additional components, such as at least one
      of graphite, carbon (e.g., carbon black), titanium dioxide, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The conductive particles may be any conductive material,
      such as silver, copper, nickel, aluminum, steel, metal alloys,
      carbon nanotubes, any other conductive material, and any
      combination thereof. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the
      conductive particles are silver coated copper. Alternatively, the
      conductive particles may be a combination of a conductive material
      and a non-conductive material. For example, the conductive
      particles may be ceramic magnetic microspheres coated with a
      conductive material such as any of the conductive materials
      described above. Furthermore, the composition of each of the
      conductive particles may vary from one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The conductive particles may be any shape from a random
      non-uniform shape to a geometric structure. The conductive
      particles may all have the same shape or the conductive particles
      may vary in shape from one another. For example, in one exemplary
      embodiment, each of the conductive particles may have a random
      non-uniform shape that varies from conductive particle to
      conductive particle.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The conductive particles may range in size from a few
      nanometers up to a few thousand nanometers. Alternatively, the
      conductive particles may range in size from about 400 nanometers
      to 30 micrometers. The conductive particles may be substantially
      similar in size or may be of various sizes included in the above
      identified ranges. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, the
      conductive particles are of various sizes in the range of about
      400 nanometers to 30 micrometers. Herein, when a range of sizes of
      the conductive particles are employed, the distribution of the
      sizes may be uniform or non-uniform across the range. For example,
      75% of the conductive particles may be a larger size within a
      given range while 25% of the conductive particles are a smaller
      size.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] An effective amount of conductive particles are included
      relative to the binder so that the conductive particles are
      dispersed in the binder. The conductive particles may be randomly
      or orderly dispersed in the binder. The conductive particles may
      be dispersed at uniform or non-uniform densities. The conductive
      particles may be dispersed so that at least a majority of the
      conductive particles are closely adjacent to, but do not touch,
      one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The binder is used to substantially fix the conductive
      particles relative to each other and should be a non-conductive or
      semi-conductive substance. Any type of conventional or novel
      binder that meets these criteria may be used. The non-conductive
      or semi-conductive material of the binder may be chosen to
      function as a dielectric with a given permittivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The conductive particle based material may be formed as a
      rigid or semi-rigid structure. For example, the conductive
      particle based material may be a plastic sheet having the
      conductive particles dispersed therein. The conductive particle
      based material may be clear or opaque, and may include any shade
      of color.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In addition, the conductive particle based material may be
      a liquid, paint, gel, ink or paste that dries or cures. Here, the
      binder may include distillates, hardening agents, or solvents such
      as a Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). In this case, the conductive
      particle based material may be applied to a substrate. Also, when
      the conductive particle based material is a liquid, paint, gel,
      ink or paste that dries or cures, the binder may adhere to the
      substrate. The conductive particle based material may be spayed
      on, brushed on, rolled on, ink-jet printed, silk screened, etc.
      onto the substrate. The use of the conductive particle based
      material that is a liquid, paint, gel, ink or paste that dries or
      cures is advantageous in that the conductive particle based
      material may be thinly applied to a substrate and conform to the
      surface of the substrate. This allows the conductive particle
      based material to occupy very little space and, in effect, blend
      into the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The substrate may be the surface of any conductive,
      non-conductive or semi-conductive substance. The substrate may be
      rigid, semi-flexible or flexible. The substrate may be flat,
      irregularly shaped or geometrically shaped. The substrate may be
      paper, cloth, plastic, polycarbonate, acrylic, nylon, polyester,
      rubber, metal such as aluminum, steel and metal alloys, glass,
      composite materials, fiber reinforced plastics such as fiberglass,
      polyethylene, polypropylene, fiberglass, textiles, wood, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The substrate may have a coating applied thereto. The
      coating may be a conductive, non-conductive or semi-conductive
      substance. The coating may be a paint, gel, ink, paste, tape, etc.
      The coating may be chosen to function as a dielectric with a given
      permittivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] At least one of a protective and concealing (or decorative)
      coating may be applied over the conductive particle based material
      once it has been applied to a substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] An example of the conductive particle based material is
      described below with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 1 is a captured image of a conductive particle based
      material according to an exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Referring to FIG. 1, the conductive particle based material
      includes conductive particles and a binder. The conductive
      particles are randomly shaped, sized and located. However,
      conductive particles are dispersed so that at least a majority of
      the conductive particles are closely adjacent to, but do not
      touch, one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Herein, without intending to be limiting, for a conductive
      particle based material of a given density of conductive
      particles, the conductive particle based material may be applied
      at a thickness such that the conductive particles are dispersed in
      the binder so that at least a majority of the conductive particles
      are closely adjacent to, but do not touch, one another. Herein,
      without intending to be limiting, it has been observed that a
      conductive particle based material has a resistance of about 3-17
      ohms across any given two points on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Herein, without intending to be limiting, it has been
      observed that when the conductive particle based material is
      formulated such that the conductive particles are dispersed in the
      binder so that at least a majority of the conductive particles are
      closely adjacent to, but do not touch, one another, the conductive
      particle based material exhibits properties that enable it to at
      least one of efficiently propagate electromagnetic radiation,
      efficiently absorb electromagnetic radiation from space, and
      efficiently emit electromagnetic radiation into space. Moreover,
      it has been observed that those properties may be either
      supplemented or enhanced by including an effective amount of
      carbon, such as carbon black, in the conductive particle based
      material. For example, an effective amount of carbon black may be
      an amount that corresponds to about 1-7% of the conductive
      particles included in the conductive particle based material.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Without intending to be limiting, it is believed that when
      electromagnetic radiation is introduced into the conductive
      particle based material, electromagnetic radiation may pass from
      conductive particle to conductive particle via at least one of
      capacitive and inductive coupling. Here, the binder may function
      as a dielectric. Thus, it is believed that the conductive particle
      based material may act as an array of capacitors, which may be at
      least part of the reason why the conductive particle based
      material at least one of efficiently propagates electromagnetic
      radiation, efficiently absorbs electromagnetic radiation from
      space, and efficiently emits electromagnetic radiation into space.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Alternatively or additionally, and without intending to be
      limiting, it is believed that the properties that enable the
      conductive particle based material to at least one of efficiently
      propagate electromagnetic radiation, efficiently absorb
      electromagnetic radiation from space, and efficiently emit
      electromagnetic radiation into space, may be explained by quantum
      theory at the atomic level.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Herein, without intending to be limiting, it has been
      observed that the conductive particle based material generates
      electrical energy when exposed to sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Herein, without intending to be limiting, it has been
      observed that the resistance of the conductive particle based
      material continuously changes over time. Herein, without intending
      to be limiting, it has been observed that, when energized with a
      radio signal, the conductive particle based material has
      infinitely low resistance to that signal.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Herein, while the present disclosure is described in the
      context of electromagnetic radiation, without intending to be
      limiting, it is believed that the present invention is equally
      applicable to bioelectromagnetic energy. Thus, any disclosure
      herein that refers to electromagnetic radiation equally applies to
      bioelectromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conductive Particle Based Antenna</b><br>
      <br>
      [0052] In one exemplary embodiment, the conductive particle based
      material is employed to implement a conductive particle based
      antenna. When used as a conductive particle based antenna, the
      conductive particle based antenna is fabricated using the
      conductive particle based material. Here, the conductive particle
      based material may be formed into a shape that conforms to the
      desired characteristics of the antenna. For example, the shape and
      size of the antenna may vary depending on the frequency and/or
      polarization of the electromagnetic radiation to be communicated.
      The conductive particle based antenna is at least one of
      electrically, capacitively, and inductively coupled to at least
      one of a receiver, a transmitter, and a transceiver at a coupling
      point of the conductive particle based antenna. The coupling point
      of the conductive particle based antenna may substantially be an
      end point of the conductive particle based antenna. The coupling
      point of the conductive particle based antenna may be coupled to a
      coupling point of a feed line electrically connected to the
      receiver, transmitter, or transceiver. When capacitively or
      inductively coupled, the coupling may occur through a distance
      that includes an air gap or that has a substance, such as glass,
      disposed therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] When a conductive particle based antenna is fabricated
      using the conductive particle based material, the conductive
      particle based antenna may exhibit a broad bandwidth self-tuning
      characteristic by using only a small section of the conductive
      particle based antenna to emit the electromagnetic radiation into
      space.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In addition, when the conductive particle based antenna is
      fabricated using the conductive particle based material, there may
      be no or little I&lt;2&gt;R losses due the small practical size
      and the majority of the particles not contacting each other. In
      addition, there may be no or little Radio Frequency (RF) skin
      effect losses due to the small practical size. Once the signal is
      coupled to the conductive particle based antenna, the conductive
      particle based antenna provides little to no resistance to the
      transmission signal and it is emitted without significant loss
      into space. The same may happen in reverse for receiving. That is,
      the received signal may be absorbed and delivered with little to
      no loss to the coupling device and is then propagated down a feed
      line to a receiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] An example of the conductive particle based antenna is
      described below with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 2 illustrates a conductive particle based antenna
      according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The
      particular structure of the conductive particle based antenna 200
      shown in FIG. 2 is merely an example used for explanation and is
      not intended to be limiting. The conductive particle based
      material used to fabricate the conductive particle based antenna
      200 of FIG. 2 is assumed to be formulated as a liquid, paint, gel,
      ink, or paste that dries or cures.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Referring to FIG. 2, the conductive particle based antenna
      200 includes a substrate 210, a first antenna segment 220A, a
      second antenna segment 220B, a first coupler 230A, a second
      coupler 230B, and a feed line 240.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The substrate 210 is a rigid flat sheet of a non-conductive
      material, such as plexiglass. However, any other surface may be
      chosen as substrate 210. For example, the surface of a vehicle,
      the wall of a building, the casing of a wireless device, glass, a
      tree, cloth, a rock, a plastic sheet, etc., may be chosen as the
      substrate. When a conductive material is chosen as the substrate
      210, an insulative coating of a non-conductive or semi-conductive
      material may be applied to the area of the substrate 210 where the
      conductive particle based antenna 200 is to be applied. Examples
      of the insulative coating of the non-conductive or semi-conductive
      material include plastic tape, paper tape, paint, etc. Also, when
      the substrate 210 is a conductive material, the substrate may be
      utilized as a ground plane. In addition, a surface preparation
      coating may be applied to the substrate 210 that allows for better
      adhesion of the conductive particle based material to the
      substrate 210. The insulative coating may serve the same function
      as the surface preparation coating. Also, the surface preparation
      coating may be applied beneath or on top of the insulative
      coating. Furthermore, the surface preparation coating may be used
      when the insulative coating in not applied.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The first antenna segment 220A and the second antenna
      segment 220B are applied to the substrate 210 according to a
      desired design. Here, the first antenna segment 220A is
      functioning as an active antenna element and the second antenna
      segment 220B is functioning as a ground plane. When the substrate
      210 is functioning as a ground plane or an earth ground is
      employed, the second antenna segment 220B may be omitted. Here,
      the first antenna segment 220A and the second antenna segment 220B
      are formed using a conductive particle based material formulated
      as a liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or cures. The
      non-conductive material may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled on,
      silk screened, ink jet printed, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The first coupler 230A and the second coupler 230B at least
      one of electrically, capacitively, and inductively couple to the
      first antenna segment 220A and the second antenna segment 220B,
      respectively. In addition, the first coupler 230A and the second
      coupler 230B adhere to, or are otherwise in a fixed relationship
      with, the first antenna segment 220A and the second antenna
      segment 220B. The first coupler 230A and the second coupler 230B
      are electrically connected to respective portions of the feed line
      240.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The feed line 240 is electrically connected to first
      coupler 230A and the second coupler 230B. Also, the feed line 240
      is electrically connected to at least one of a receiver, a
      transmitter, and a transceiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] An example of a structure of a conductive particle based
      antenna is described below with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 3 illustrates a structure of a conductive particle
      based antenna according to an exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention. The particular structure of the conductive particle
      based antenna shown in FIG. 3 is merely an example used for
      explanation and is not intended to be limiting. The conductive
      particle based material used to fabricate the conductive particle
      based antenna of FIG. 3 is assumed to be formulated as a liquid,
      paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or cures.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Referring to FIG. 3, the conductive particle based antenna
      includes a substrate 310, first coating 350, conductive particle
      based material coating 320, and a second coating 360. One or more
      of the substrate 310, the first coating 350, and the second
      coating 360 may be omitted. In addition, one or more additional
      coatings may be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The substrate 310 may be any surface of any object,
      regardless of what material(s) the object is constructed of. For
      example, the surface of a vehicle, the wall of a building, the
      casing of a wireless device, glass, a tree, cloth, a rock, a
      plastic sheet, etc., may be chosen as the substrate. When the
      substrate 310 is a conductive material, the substrate 310 may
      function as a ground plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The first coating 350 is applied on top of the substrate
      310. The first coating 350 may be at least one of an insulative
      coating and a surface preparation coating. As an insulative
      coating, the first coating 350 may be a non-conductive or
      semi-conductive material. Examples of the insulative coating of
      the non-conductive or semi-conductive material include plastic
      tape, paper tape, paint, etc. As a surface preparation coating,
      the first coating 350 may be any material that allows for better
      adhesion of the conductive particle based material coating 320 to
      the substrate 310. The same coating may serve as both the
      insulative coating and a surface preparation coating.
      Alternatively, separate insulative and a surface preparation
      coatings may be utilized either together or individually. The
      first coating 350 may be formulated as a liquid, paint, gel, ink,
      or paste that dries or cures. In this case, the first coating 350
      may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled on, silk screened, ink jet
      printed, etc. The first coating 350 may be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The conductive particle based material coating 320 is
      applied on top of the first coating 350, if present. Otherwise,
      the conductive particle based material coating 320 is applied on
      top of the substrate 320. Alternatively, the conductive particle
      based material coating 320 may be an independent structure. The
      conductive particle based material coating may be formulated using
      any formulation of the conductive particle based material
      described herein. For example, the conductive particle based
      material coating 320 may be formulated as a liquid, paint, gel,
      ink, or paste that dries or cures. In this case, the
      non-conductive material may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled on,
      silk screened, ink jet printed, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The second coating 360, if utilized, is applied on top of
      the conductive particle based material coating 320. The second
      coating 360 may serve to protect and/or conceal the conductive
      particle based material coating 320. The second coating 360 may be
      any material or structure that protects and/or conceals the
      conductive particle based material coating 320. The same coating
      may serve as both the protective coating and the concealment
      coating. Alternatively, separate protective and concealment
      coatings may be utilized either together or individually. In one
      exemplary embodiment, the second coating 360 is formulated as a
      liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or cures. In this
      case, the second coating 360 may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled
      on, silk screened, ink jet printed, etc. The second coating 360
      may be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Tests were conducted to compare the conductive particle
      based antenna to a conventional antenna. The conductive particle
      based antenna was formed using the conductive particle based
      material whereas the conventional copper antenna was formed using
      solid copper strips. Both the conductive particle based antenna
      and the conventional copper antenna were fabricated with the same
      shape (i.e., the shape shown in FIG. 2) of the same size so that
      the effect of the particular structure, if any, is equal to both
      antennas. A non-conductive plexiglass substrate was used to fix
      both antennas. The same transmit power and frequency were used for
      the test. The frequency selected was in the range of about 460
      MHz. Testing equipment included a Yeasu FT 7900 Dual band FM
      transceiver, a Telewave Model 44 Wattmeter, and a FieldFox Model
      N9912A Portable Network Analyzer operated in SA mode used with a
      Yeasu Model Rubber Duck Antenna that was located 160 feet from the
      test antennas. The test data for the conventional copper antenna
      and the conductive particle based antenna are provided below in
      Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      [0070] As can be seen in Table 1, the conductive particle based
      antenna exhibits a significantly higher forward power (i.e., 41
      watts) than the forward power of the conventional copper antenna
      (i.e., 22 watts). This can be explained by the conductive particle
      based antenna exhibiting a significantly lower reverse power
      (i.e., 1 watt) than the reverse power of the conventional copper
      antenna (i.e., 12 watts). Accordingly, the resulting relative
      signal strength of the conductive particle based antenna is higher
      (-26 decibels) than the resulting relative signal strength of the
      conventional copper antenna (-35 decibels).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] As can be gleaned from the test, for a given antenna
      structure, the conductive particle based antenna is more efficient
      at emitting electromagnetic radiation into space than the
      conventional copper antenna. Therefore, the conductive particle
      based antenna has a higher effective gain than the conventional
      copper antenna. Also, since there is less reverse power, less of
      the electromagnetic radiation input to the conductive particle
      based antenna may be converted into heat. Thus, the antenna may
      operate at a lower temperature for a given input power and
      therefore may have a higher power rating.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The added gain by using the conductive particle based
      antenna is well suited to any application in which higher gain
      and/or lower transmit power for a given antenna structure is
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] It has been observed that the transmission performance of
      the conductive particle based antenna varies depending on the type
      of amplifier used to drive the antenna. For example, the
      transmitter used in the Yeasu FT 7900 Dual band FM transceiver in
      the above test is a class C amplifier. When a linear class A
      amplifier is employed, the transmission performance of the
      conductive particle based antenna is reduced and approaches that
      of the conventional copper antenna. Thus, the performance of the
      conductive particle based antenna is greater when used with an
      amplifier that operates for less than the entire input cycle, such
      as the class C amplifier. While a class C amplifier is referred to
      herein for convenience in explanation, the use of any amplifier
      that operates for less than the entire input cycle is equally
      applicable.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Herein, power constrained devices typically employ a class
      C amplifier in order to take advantage of their efficiency so as
      to conserve power. Similarly, the use of the conductive particle
      based antenna in power constrained devices that employ a class C
      amplifier takes advantage of the efficiency of the conductive
      particle based antenna so as to further conserve power. The power
      conservation gained by the power constrained devices by using the
      conductive particle based antenna may allow for longer operational
      times and/or smaller power source (e.g., batteries) (and thereby
      smaller devices and/or a lower cost).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conductive Particle Based Antenna Enhancer</b><br>
      <br>
      [0075] In one exemplary embodiment, the conductive particle based
      material is employed to implement a conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer. When used as a conductive particle based antenna
      enhancer, the conductive particle based antenna enhancer is
      fabricated using the conductive particle based material. Here, the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer is disposed in an
      adjacent offset relationship to a conventional antenna with a
      non-conductive or semi-conductive material disposed there between.
      Alternatively or additionally, an air gap between the conventional
      antenna and the conductive particle based antenna enhancer may be
      employed. Here, the conventional antenna is electrically coupled
      to at least one of a receiver, a transmitter, and a transceiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In this configuration, the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer is at least one of capacitively and inductively
      coupled to the conventional antenna. Herein, the electromagnetic
      radiation that is capacitively and inductively coupled from the
      conventional antenna to the conductive particle based antenna
      enhancer is efficiently radiated into space by the conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The conductive particle based antenna enhancer may be
      fabricated and positioned so as to be adjacent and offset from the
      conventional antenna. For example, the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer may be added or built into a structure that
      places it in an adjacent and offset relationship to the
      conventional antenna.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] For example, the structure may create an air gap between
      the conventional antenna and a surface onto which the conductive
      particle based material is applied. The structure may be
      constructed of a nonconductive material. Alternatively, the
      structure may be constructed of a conductive material and at least
      partially coated with a nonconductive material. If the structure
      is constructed of a conductive material, the conductive particle
      based material may be applied on top of the nonconductive material
      coating the structure. Herein, the conductive particle based
      material may be applied to a side of the structure closest to the
      conventional antenna or a side of the structure furthest from the
      conventional antenna. The conductive particle based material may
      be coated with a layer of the nonconductive material or another
      material. Examples of the structure include a housing of a device
      (e.g., a housing of a wireless device), an enclosure placed over
      the existing antenna, and a case placed over a housing of a device
      (e.g., a protective cover for a wireless device). The conductive
      particle based material is at least one of capacitively and
      inductively coupled to the conventional antenna and thereby
      increases the performance of the conventional antenna. Here, the
      thickness the nonconductive material and/or air gap directly
      affects the performance gain of the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer and if the nonconductive thickness and/or air gap
      is too large, performance may decrease. The thickness of the air
      gap and/or nonconductive material is very small in relationship to
      the wavelength of the frequency the conventional antenna is
      designed for. In a specific example of the exemplary
      implementation described above, a conventional bumper case for an
      iPhone, which is manufactured by Apple, may have the conductive
      particle based material applied to a portion thereof that is
      adjacent to the antenna of the iPhone (the surface that is
      concealed when the iPhone is installed therein). Here, the
      conductive particle based material may have a layer of
      nonconductive material applied on top.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Another example of an implementation of a conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer is described below with reference
      to FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] FIG. 4 illustrates an implementation of a conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer according to an exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention. The particular structure of
      the conductive particle based antenna shown in FIG. 4 is merely an
      example used for explanation and is not intended to be limiting.
      The conductive particle based material used to fabricate the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer of FIG. 4 is assumed to
      be formulated as a liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or
      cures.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Referring to FIG. 4, a wireless device 480 and a protective
      cover 490 are shown. The wireless device 480 includes an internal
      antenna 470. The protective cover 490 includes a conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer 420 that is disposed so as to be
      adjacent to the internal antenna 470 when the wireless device 480
      is disposed in the protective cover 490.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] While the conductive particle based antenna enhancer 420 is
      shown to correspond to the size of the internal antenna 470, the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer 420 may be smaller or
      larger than the internal antenna 470. In addition, while the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer 420 is shown as being
      disposed immediately adjacent to the internal antenna, the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer 420 may be disposed at
      a different location on the protective cover 490.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] While the conductive particle based antenna enhancer 420 is
      shown as being applied to an inner surface of the protective cover
      490, the conductive particle based antenna enhancer 420 may be
      applied to an outer surface of, or may be disposed within, the
      protective cover 490. When the conductive particle based antenna
      enhancer 420 is disposed within the protective cover 490, the
      material used to construct the protective cover 490 may serve as
      the binder for the conductive particle based material. When, the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer 420 is disposed at an
      inner or outer surface of the conductive particle based material,
      one or more of an insulative coating, a surface preparation
      coating, a protective coating, and a concealment coating may be
      used. In addition, the conductive particle based antenna enhancer
      420 may be formed as an independent structure (with or without a
      substrate) that is fixed to the protective cover 490.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The conductive particle based antenna enhancer may be added
      to an existing conventional antenna or may be added at the time
      the conventional antenna is fabricated.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In one exemplary embodiment, the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer is used to coat a conventional antenna that has
      been coated with a non-conductive material. The coating of the
      non-conductive material may be implemented as a liquid, paint,
      gel, ink, or paste that dries or cures. Herein, the non-conductive
      material may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled on, silk screened,
      ink jet printed, etc. Alternatively, the coating of the
      non-conductive material may be a film or tape that is applied to
      the conventional antenna. Layers of other materials may be
      disposed between the conventional antenna and the non-conductive
      material and/or between the non-conductive material and the
      conductive particle based material. Here, depending on the
      configuration, the conductive particle based material may be
      coated with a layer of the nonconductive material and/or another
      material. Here, the thickness the non-conductive material may
      directly affect the performance gain of the conductive particle
      based material and if the thickness of the non-conductive material
      is too large, performance may decrease. The thickness of the
      non-conductive material is very small in relationship to the
      wavelength of the frequency the conventional antenna is designed
      for.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] An example of a structure of a coated conductive particle
      based antenna enhancer is described below with reference to FIG.
      5.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] FIG. 5 illustrates a structure of a coated conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer according to an exemplary
      embodiment of the present invention. The particular structure of
      the conductive particle based antenna shown in FIG. 5 is merely an
      example used for explanation and is not intended to be limiting.
      The conductive particle based material used to fabricate the
      conductive particle based antenna of FIG. 5 is assumed to be
      formulated as a liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or
      cures.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Referring to FIG. 5, the coated conductive particle based
      antenna includes a conventional antenna 570, a first coating 550,
      a conductive particle based material coating 520, and a second
      coating 560. One or more of the first coating 550, and a second
      coating 560 may be omitted. In addition, one or more additional
      coatings may be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The conventional antenna 570 may be any surface of any
      conventional antenna, which in this example, is assumed to be
      constructed of a conductive material such as metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The first coating 550 is applied on top of the conventional
      antenna 570. The first coating 550 may be at least one of an
      insulative coating and a surface preparation coating. As an
      insulative coating, the first coating 550 may be a non-conductive
      or semi-conductive material. Examples of the insulative coating of
      the non-conductive or semi-conductive material include plastic
      tape, paper tape, paint, etc. As a surface preparation coating,
      the first coating 550 may be any material that allows for better
      adhesion of the conductive particle based material coating 520 to
      the conventional antenna 570. The same coating may serve as both
      the insulative coating and a surface preparation coating.
      Alternatively, separate insulative and a surface preparation
      coatings may be utilized either together or individually. The
      first coating 550 may be formulated as a liquid, paint, gel, ink,
      or paste that dries or cures. In this case, the first coating 550
      may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled on, silk screened, ink jet
      printed, etc. The first coating 550 may be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The conductive particle based material coating 520 is
      applied on top of the first coating 550, if present. Otherwise,
      the conductive particle based material coating 320 is applied on
      top of the conventional antenna 570. The conductive particle based
      material coating may be formulated using any formulation of the
      conductive particle based material described herein. For example,
      the conductive particle based material coating 520 may be
      formulated as a liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or
      cures. In this case, the non-conductive material may be sprayed
      on, brushed on, rolled on, silk screened, ink jet printed, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The second coating 560, if utilized, is applied on top of
      the conductive particle based material coating 520. The second
      coating 560 may serve to protect and/or conceal the conductive
      particle based material coating 520. The second coating 560 may be
      any material or structure that protects and/or conceals the
      conductive particle based material coating 520. The same coating
      may serve as both the protective coating and the concealment
      coating. Alternatively, separate protective and concealment
      coatings may be utilized either together or individually. In one
      exemplary embodiment, the second coating 560 is formulated as a
      liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or cures. In this
      case, the second coating 560 may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled
      on, silk screened, ink jet printed, etc. The second coating 560
      may be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The conductive particle based antenna enhancer may be
      fabricated and positioned so as to be adjacent and offset from all
      or a portion of the conventional antenna. For example, the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer may be fabricated and
      positioned so as to be adjacent to a portion of the conventional
      antenna corresponding to half or a quarter of the desired
      wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] An example of an antenna partially coated with a conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer is described below with reference
      to FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] FIG. 6 illustrates an antenna partially coated with a
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer according to an
      exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The particular
      structure of the antenna partially coated with the conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer shown in FIG. 6 is merely an
      example used for explanation and is not intended to be limiting.
      The conductive particle based material used to fabricate the
      conductive particle based antenna of FIG. 6 is assumed to be
      formulated as a liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or
      cures.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Referring to FIG. 6, an antenna 670 that is connected to a
      feed line 640 is shown. The antenna 670 is partially coated with a
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer 620. As can be seen,
      the conductive particle based antenna enhancer 620 coats about a
      quarter of the antenna 670.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Tests were conducted to compare a conventional copper
      antenna to the conventional copper antenna with the conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer. In particular, the same equipment
      and testing conditions as the test described above with respect to
      the conductive particle based antenna were performed. Here,
      insulative tape was applied to the entirety of the conventional
      copper antenna and the conductive particle based material was then
      applied onto the insulative tape.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The test data for the conventional copper antenna and the
      conventional copper antenna that has been enhanced with the
      conductive particle based antenna enhancer are provided below in
      Table 2.<br>

      Strength<br>
      <br>
      [0099] As can be seen in Table 2, the conventional copper antenna
      with the conductive particle based antenna enhancer exhibits a
      significantly higher forward power (i.e., 28 watts) than the
      forward power of the conventional copper antenna alone (i.e., 22
      watts). This can be explained by the conventional copper antenna
      with the conductive particle based antenna enhancer exhibiting a
      significantly lower reverse power (i.e., 10 watts) than the
      reverse power of the conventional copper antenna alone (i.e., 12
      watts). Accordingly, the resulting relative signal strength of the
      conventional copper antenna with the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer is higher (-27 decibels) than the resulting
      relative signal strength of the conventional copper antenna (-35
      decibels).<br>
      <br>
      [0100] As can be gleaned from the above identified test, the
      conventional copper antenna with the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer is more efficient at emitting electromagnetic
      signals into space than the conventional copper antenna alone.
      Therefore, the conventional copper antenna with the conductive
      particle based antenna enhancer has a higher effective gain than
      the conventional copper antenna alone. Also, since there is less
      reverse power, less of the electromagnetic radiation input to the
      conventional copper antenna with the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer will be converted into heat. Thus, the
      conventional copper antenna with the conductive particle based
      antenna enhancer may operate at a lower temperature for a given
      input power and therefore may have a higher power rating.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Accordingly, the conductive particle based material may be
      used to enhance a conventional antenna.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conductive Particle Based Transmission Line</b><br>
      <br>
      [0102] The conductive particle based material may be used to form
      a conductive particle based transmission line. To implement a
      conductive particle based transmission line, a transmission line
      is formed in any of the various ways described herein for forming
      an object using the conductive particle based material. Herein, at
      least some of the properties that enable the conductive particle
      based material to efficiently radiate electromagnetic radiation
      into space allow the conductive particle based material to
      efficiently radiate electromagnetic radiation down the
      transmission line formed using the conductive particle based
      material. The use of the conductive particle based material as a
      transmission line is beneficial due to its lower resistance and
      heat generation.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Conductive Particle Based Electromagnetic Radiation
        Harvester</b><br>
      <br>
      [0103] The conductive particle based material may be used as an
      electromagnetic radiation harvester. The high efficiencies of the
      conductive particle based material in at least one of propagating
      and absorbing electromagnetic radiation make it ideally suited for
      use in collecting electromagnetic radiation. While such collected
      electromagnetic radiation may be electromagnetic radiation that
      was transmitted with the intention of being harvested by the
      electromagnetic radiation harvester, the collected electromagnetic
      radiation may be background electromagnetic radiation. Herein, the
      electromagnetic radiation harvester may be coupled to a receiver
      that collects the energy absorbed by the electromagnetic radiation
      harvester. The electromagnetic radiation harvester is formed in
      any of the various ways described herein for forming an object
      using the conductive particle based material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conductive Particle Based Conformable Antenna</b><br>
      <br>
      [0104] The conductive particle based material may be used to
      construct a conductive particle based conformable antenna. The
      benefit of the conductive particle based conformable antenna may
      be easily appreciated when considered in the context of an
      exemplary use case, which is described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] According to the exemplary use case, the conductive
      particle based conformable antenna may use used in a military
      setting. The Special Operations community has a major logistical
      and safety issue when it comes to communications in the theater.
      The US Department of Defense (DoD) has rapidly expanded its
      communications capabilities within the radio spectrum. In the
      past, two way radios in a variety of form factors where used for
      conventional Push-To-Talk (PTT) communications. The use of these
      systems has now evolved into a true "Digital Battlefield"
      consisting of a multitude of communications platforms. Vast arrays
      of data networks came into reality. The scope of radios used today
      varies widely from conventional voice to Satellite, mesh networks,
      to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and unattended ground sensors.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The reason this wide variety of systems is mentioned is to
      give an understanding of why the conductive particle based
      conformable antenna may be beneficial to the mission of soldiers.
      Every RF device utilized by the military operates on a wide range
      of frequencies and a different type of transmission (Amplitude
      Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), Satcom, Single Side
      band, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0107] However, conventional antenna systems are designed and
      tuned for a limited range of frequencies and are generally
      designed to work with only one of the hundreds of types of radio
      devices on the market. The other major downsides to these
      conventional antenna systems are the logistics of getting them
      into battle. They are heavy, bulky, expensive, and difficult to
      transport. Accordingly, there is a need to address the
      shortcomings of the conventional antenna systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The conductive particle based conformable antenna addresses
      the shortcomings of the conventional antenna systems by being
      operable with any and all of the radios currently deployed and
      being developed. As opposed to being an antenna of fixed form, the
      conductive particle based conformable antenna may instead be
      constructed on an as needed basis.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] For example, the conductive particle based conformable
      antenna may be constructed on site using the conductive particle
      based material. In this case, the conductive particle based
      material is a liquid, paint, gel, ink or paste that dries or
      cures. Herein, the conductive particle based conformable antenna
      may be applied to a substrate. In particular, the conductive
      particle based material may be sprayed on, brushed on, rolled on,
      silk screened, ink jet printed, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The conductive particle based conformable antenna may be
      designed based on typical antenna design, theory, and formulas.
      The antenna design may be generated in advance or at the time the
      antenna is needed based on desired characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The conductive particle based material is applied to the
      substrate to form the conductive particle based conformable
      antenna based on the desired antenna design.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The substrate may be any surface of any material, such as
      acrylic, ABS, structural foams, solvent sensitive materials such
      as polycarbonate and polystyrene, and non-porous surfaces
      including primed wallboard, wood and clean metals, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] When the substrate is a conducting material, a
      non-conductive or semi-conductive coating may first be applied to
      the substrate. In this case, the conducting material may serve as
      a ground plane. When the substrate is a non-conducting material, a
      ground plane can be accomplished by using the earth's natural
      ground. Alternatively, the ground plane can be accomplished by
      fabricating an independent ground plane.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Once the antenna is fabricated, a feed line is coupled to
      the conductive particle based conformable antenna and an RF
      communications device. The conductive particle based conformable
      antenna is at least one of electrically, capacitively, and
      inductively coupled to a coupling point of the feed line. The
      conductive particle based conformable antenna may be coupled to
      the coupling point of the feed line at an end point of the
      conductive particle based conformable antenna. When capacitively
      or inductively coupled, the coupling may occur through a distance
      that includes an air gap or a substance, such as glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] To fabricate the conductive particle based conformable
      antenna, a template of the desired antenna design may be used. The
      template may be a sheet formed of any rigid or semi-rigid material
      in which the desired design of the antenna is cut out.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] An example of a template used to fabricate a conductive
      particle based conformable antenna is described below with
      reference to FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] FIG. 7 illustrates a template used to fabricate a
      conductive particle based conformable antenna according to an
      exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Referring to FIG. 7, a template 700 is shown. The template
      700 may be any material that may be used to form a template or
      stencil. For example, the template 700 may be a sheet formed of a
      rigid or semi-rigid material. The cut out of the template 700 may
      be at least one of a positive and a negative of a desired design
      of an antenna. The template 700 may be an image displayed on a
      surface showing where conductive particle based material should or
      should not be applied. The template 700 may be an image displayed
      on a display or in a guide book that shows a desired design of an
      antenna. Herein, the template 700 shown in FIG. 7 corresponds to
      the antenna design shown in FIG. 2.<br>

      [0120] An exemplary method for fabricating a conductive particle
      based conformable antenna using a template is described below with
      reference to FIG. 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] FIG. 8 illustrates a method for fabricating a conductive
      particle based conformable antenna using a template according to
      an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Herein, the
      conductive particle based material used to fabricate the
      conductive particle based conformable antenna is assumed to be
      formulated as a liquid, paint, gel, ink, or paste that dries or
      cures.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Referring to FIG. 8, a template and substrate is chosen in
      step 800. In step 810, the chosen template may be fixed against
      the chosen substrate. In step 820, the conductive particle based
      material may then be applied on the template such that the
      conductive particle based material passes through at least one cut
      out portion of the template so as to be applied to the
      corresponding portion of the substrate. The conductive particle
      based material may be applied until its particle density reaches a
      certain threshold. This may be determined by measuring the
      resistance of the material across the length of the antenna (or
      antenna segment). Here, the threshold may correspond to a
      predefined resistance or range of resistances (e.g., 11-15 ohms).<br>
      <br>
      [0123] The template may then be removed leaving the conductive
      particle based material to dry or cure on the chosen substrate
      according to the desired design. In step 830, one or more coupling
      points of a feed line may be affixed to the conductive particle
      based conformable antenna. Herein, step 830 may be omitted. In
      addition, additional steps may be included, such as applying at
      least one of an insulative coating, a surface preparation coating,
      a protective coating, and a concealment coating. Any or all of
      this fabrication technique may be automated, as will be described
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] While a conductive particle based conformable antenna is
      described herein, any disclosure related to a conductive particle
      based conformable antenna is equally applicable to a conductive
      particle based conformable antenna enhancer.<br>

      </b><b>Fabrication Techniques for Conductive Particle Based
        Conformable Antenna</b><br>
      <br>
      [0125] In one exemplary embodiment, techniques for constructing a
      conductive particle based conformable antenna are described.
      Herein, a computerized device is used to generate a template that
      is used to construct a conductive particle based conformable
      antenna.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] The computerized device may be any of a desktop computer, a
      laptop computer, a netbook, a tablet computer, a Personal Data
      Assistant (PDA), a Smartphone, a portable media device, a
      specialized mobile device, etc. The computerized device may
      include one or more of a display, an input unit, a control unit, a
      printer, memory, a communications unit, and a projection unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] The conductive particle based conformable antenna that is
      constructed using the template may be formed using the conductive
      particle based material that is sprayable, rollable or brushable.
      The conductive particle based material may be applied directly
      onto any substrate. The conductive particle based conformable
      antenna, once fabricated onto a surface, may be painted over with
      a paint in order to conceal the antenna, provide protection to the
      antenna, or provide the antenna with desired aesthetics.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] According to an exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention, to create and install an antenna, the computerized
      device may be used to generate the template. The computerized
      device may include a graphical user interface that queries a user
      regarding certain characteristics/criteria or otherwise allows a
      user to enter certain characteristics/criteria. Based on the input
      characteristics/criteria, the computerized device generates the
      template. Herein, the user may input less than all of the
      characteristics/criteria. In this case, the
      characteristics/criteria not input by the user may be obtained via
      a formula, or a local or remote database. In addition, assumed
      values for the characteristics/criteria not input by the user may
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Examples of the characteristics/criteria include one or
      more of a substrate on which the antenna will be disposed,
      frequency of operation, aperture or antenna pattern, whether a
      space saving design is desired, velocity factor, resonant
      frequency, Q factor, impedance, gain, polarization, efficiency,
      bandwidth, heat characteristics, type of amplifier, environment,
      etc. Further, one or more of the characteristics/criteria may
      include a number of preset options for a given
      characteristic/criteria. For example, the options for the
      substrate on which the antenna will be disposed may include one or
      more of wood, metal, glass, plastic, etc. For another example, the
      options for the desired antenna pattern include one or more of an
      omni-directional antenna pattern, a directional antenna pattern, a
      circular antenna pattern, a phased array antenna pattern, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The computerized device may guide a user in inputting at
      least one of the one or more the characteristics/criteria and may
      request additional information from the user.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Based on the input one or more characteristics/criteria,
      the computerized device determines an antenna pattern using a
      pattern determination algorithm. The antenna pattern may be a
      preset antenna pattern or an antenna pattern formed based on an
      algorithm and the input one or more characteristics/criteria. In
      addition, the computerized device may determine one or more of a
      scaling factor of the antenna pattern, dimensions of the antenna
      pattern or elements of the antenna pattern, grain direction,
      application notes, etc. Alternatively, or additionally, the
      characteristics/criteria may not be preset.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] The computerized device may determine more than one antenna
      pattern and may allow a user to select a desired antenna pattern
      from among the determined more than one antenna pattern.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Once the antenna pattern is determined, as well as one or
      more of the scaling factor of the antenna pattern, dimensions of
      the antenna pattern or elements of the antenna pattern, grain
      direction, application notes, etc., a resulting template may be at
      least one of displayed on the display of the computerized device,
      projected onto a surface using the projection unit of the
      computerized device, and printed using one of an external and an
      integrated printed. When a projection unit is employed, the
      computerized device may further include a device that adjusts the
      scale of the projected template based on at least the distance
      between the projection unit and the surface on which the antenna
      is to be constructed. Further, when a projection unit is employed,
      the computerized device may further include a device that adjusts
      the location of the projected template so that the projected
      template remains on the same location of the surface regardless of
      the movement of the computerized device. The template may then be
      used to construct the antenna.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Also, the template may correspond to digital data that is
      stored in a storage device or communicated to another device that
      applies the antenna material based on the digital data.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] In one exemplary embodiment, the computerized device
      communicates the input characteristics/criteria to a remote
      computerized device which determines one or more of the antenna
      pattern, the scaling factor of the antenna pattern, dimensions of
      the antenna pattern or elements of the antenna pattern, grain
      direction, application notes, etc., which is then communicated to
      the computerized device.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] In one exemplary embodiment, the antenna patterns may be
      stored remotely from the computerized device and communicated to
      the computerized device before or after the antenna pattern is
      determined. The antenna patterns may be communicated to the
      computerized device in response to a request by the computerized
      device or another entity.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] An exemplary method for fabricating a conductive particle
      based conformable antenna using a computerized device is described
      below with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] FIG. 9 illustrates a method for fabricating a conductive
      particle based conformable antenna using a computerized device
      according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] Referring to FIG. 9, in step 900, the
      characteristics/criteria are obtained by the computerized device
      as described above. In step 910, an antenna pattern is selected by
      the computerized device based on the obtained
      characteristics/criteria, as described above. In step 920, a
      template is generated as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] An example of the computerized device described above is
      described below with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] FIG. 10 illustrates a structure of computerized device used
      for fabricating a conductive particle based conformable antenna
      according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] Referring to FIG. 10, the computerized device includes a
      controller 1010, a display unit 1020, a memory unit 1030, an input
      unit 1040, a communications unit 1050, a template generator 1060,
      and an antenna generator 1070. One or more of the components of
      the computerized device shown in FIG. 10 may be omitted. Also, the
      functions of one or more of the components of the computerized
      device shown in FIG. 10 may be performed by a combined component.
      In addition, additional components may be included with the
      computerized device.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] The controller 1010 controls the overall operations of the
      computerized device. More specifically, the controller 1010
      controls and/or communicates with the display unit 1020, the
      memory unit 1030, the input unit 1040, the communications unit
      1050, the template generator 1060, and the antenna generator 1070.
      The controller 1010 executes code to have performed or perform any
      of the functions/operations/algorithms/roles explicitly or
      implicitly described herein as being performed by a computerized
      device. The term "code" may be used herein to represent one or
      more of executable instructions, operand data, configuration
      parameters, and other information stored in the memory unit 1030.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The display unit 1020 is used to display information to a
      user. The display unit 1020 may be any type of display unit. The
      display unit 1020 may be integrated with or separate from the
      computerized device. The display unit 1020 may be integrated with
      the input unit 1040 to form a touch screen display. The display
      unit 1020 performs any of the functions/operations/roles
      explicitly or implicitly described herein as being performed by a
      display.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] The memory unit 1030 may store code that is processed by
      the controller 1010 to execute any of the
      functions/operations/algorithms/roles explicitly or implicitly
      described herein as being performed by a computerized device. In
      addition, one or more of other executable instructions, operand
      data, configuration parameters, and other information may be
      stored in the memory unit 1030. Depending on the exact
      configuration of the computerized device, the memory unit 1030 may
      be volatile memory (such as Random Access Memory (RAM)),
      non-volatile memory (e.g., Read Only Memory (ROM), flash memory,
      etc.) or some combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] The input unit 1040 is used to enable a user to input
      information. The input unit 1020 may be any type or combination of
      input unit, such as a touch screen, keypad, mouse, voice
      recognition, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] The communications unit 1050 transmits and receives data
      between one or more entities. The communications unit 1050 may
      include any number of transceivers, receivers, and transmitters of
      any number of types, such as wired, wireless, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The template generator 1060 may perform any of the
      functions/operations/algorithms/roles explicitly or implicitly
      described herein as being performed when generating a template.
      For example, the template generator 1060 may be a printer, a
      cutter, a projector, a display, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] The antenna generator 1070 may perform any of the

      described herein as being performed when generating an antenna.
      For example, the template generator 1060 may be a sprayer that
      sprays the conductive particle based material onto a substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] Herein, the functionality described above of the
      computerized device may result from an application installed on
      and being executed by the computerized device.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] At this point it should be noted that the present exemplary
      embodiment as described above typically involve the processing of
      input data and the generation of output data to some extent. This
      input data processing and output data generation may be
      implemented in hardware, or software in combination with hardware.

      instructions are stored and executed in a distributed fashion.
      Also, functional computer programs, instructions, and instruction
      segments for accomplishing the present invention can be easily
      construed by programmers skilled in the art to which the present
