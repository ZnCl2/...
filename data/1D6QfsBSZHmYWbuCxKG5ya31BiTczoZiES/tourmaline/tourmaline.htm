      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract -</span>- PURPOSE:To
      provide a semipermanent battery by putting far infrared radiation
      ceramic powder or a far infrared radiation ceramic powder pack in
      an inside electrolyte solution of a primary battery or a secondary
      battery, and naturally charging to recover the original potential.
      CONSTITUTION:Pulverized tourmaline fine powder belongs to far
      infrared radiation ceramics, and is put in an electrolyte of a
      battery as powder or being packed. It was found that even if the
      battery is discharged, the potential does not change. When a
      lithium battery was tested in the condition of 500mA discharge for
      10 minutes and rest for 4 hours, voltage did not vary over 7
      month. It is thought that the recess of an ionic crystal of the
      powder is charged positively and the other end is charged
      negatively to produce potential, dynamic energy such as
      temperature is converted into electric energy, and in addition by
      electromagnetic radiation from the far infrared radiation stone,
      oxidized electrolyte is reduced. <br>

      SOLVED: To provide a coated seed having an excellent germination
      performance. ; SOLUTION: This coated seed is characterized in that
      the coating contains one or more kinds of ore powder radiating far
      IR light, such as tourmaline ore powder. Such the functional
      mineral radiates growing far IR light having wavelengths of 4 to
      14[mu]m, and thereby promotes the germination of the seed. Many
      natural minerals contained in the ore promote the growth of crops
      and reinforce the disease resistance of the crops. The tourmaline
      ore is a porous ore, and has an electric characteristic that
      continuously flows a weak electric current. Therefore, the weak
      electric current stimulates the hair roots of plants to promote
      their growth. Since containing boron, the tourmaline ore can
      promote the absorption of water from the hair roots to prevent the
      fertilizer scorch of the hair roots. Therefore, the coated seed
      having a high germination rate and an excellent germination
      performance is obtained. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span>: Pyroelectricity
      in tourmaline, known since antiquity, was ascribed by S. von
      Boguslawski to a charged, asymmetric, anharmonic oscillator based
      on the Einstein model of a crystal. His predicted values of the
      pyroelectric coefficient k were in good agreement with Ackermann's
      measurements in the range 20-400 K. We have tested Boguslawski's
      model by refining the structure, at 193 and 293 K, on a sphere of
      gem-quality elbaite. The pyroelectric effect is due primarily to
      the asymmetric anharmonic vibrations of O(1), the oxygen atom of
      point symmetry 3m which has a polar environment. Its centre of
      gravity moves 0.005 Å from 193 to 293 K. It is the only atom with
      a displacement well above experimental uncertainty. Its large
      thermal parameters, which are ten times their standard deviation
      at both temperatures, clearly invalidate the assumption of an
      ellipsoidal thermal movement. This probably holds for Na and 0(2),
      which also have abnormally large temperature factors, but show no
      significant displacement.&nbsp;<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Effects of
      tourmaline ceramic balls on growth and metabolism of Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Aspergillus oryzae were
      studied. Treatments with 3, 6, 9 or 12 g of tourmaline ceramic
      balls in a 50 ml culture showed significant stimulation of the
      growth of the three microorganisms. In optimal treatments with 12
      g of tourmaline balls, the growth of S. cerevisiae, L.
      acidophilus, and A. oryzae was increased by 34, 32 and 10%,
      respectively. After 72 h fermentation of S. cerevisiae, total
      carbohydrate content in the culture medium was decreased by 65%
      and ethanol production was increased by 150%. Total carbohydrate
      content was decreased by 80% and the pH value was decreased by
      0.3, as a result of organic acid production in the medium of L.
      acidophilus after 72 h fermentation. In the case of A. oryzae,
      enzyme activities of protease and amylase were increased by 90 and
      31%, respectively, after 96 h fermentation. Results indicated that
      tourmaline stimulates initiation of growth in the early lag stage
      and increases production of metabolites at a later stage of
      fermentation. The strong stimulatory effect of tourmaline on
      growth, utilization of substrates and production of metabolites in
      the three microorganisms suggests a potential application in the
      fermentation industry.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Composition.</span> A complex
      silicate of boron and aluminum, containing varying amounts of
      ferrous iron, magnesium, manganese, calcium, sodium, potassium,
      lithium, hydroxyl and fluorine.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Crystallization.</span>
      Hexagonal-rhombohedral; hemimorphic. Crystals usually prismatic,
      vertically striated. A triangular prism, with three faces,
      prominent, which with the tendency of the prism faces to be
      vertically striated and to round into each other gives the
      crystals usually a cross section like a sphericaltriangle.
      Crystals are commonly terminated by base and low positive and
      negative rhombohedrons; sometimes scalenohedrons are present When
      the crystals are doubly terminated they usually show different
      forms at the opposite ends of the vertical axis (homomorphism).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Structure.</span> Usually in
      crystals. Sometimes massive compact; also coarse to fine columnar,
      either radiating or parallel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Physical Properties.</span>
      Vitreous to resinous luster. Color varied, depending upon the
      composition. Common tourmaline with much iron is black, sometimes
      brown. More rarely light colored in fine shades of red, pink,
      green, blue, yellow, etc. Rarely white or colorless. A single
      crystal may show several different colors either arranged in
      concentric bands about the center of the crystal or in transverse
      layers along its length. Strongly pyroelectric; i.e., when cooling
      from being heated to about 100° C. it develops positive
      electricity at one end of the crystal and negative at the other,
      which enables the crystal to attract and hold bits of paper, ete.
      Strongly diachronic; Le., light traversing the crystal in one
      direction may be of quite a different color or shade of color from
      that traversing the crystal in a direction at right angles to the
      first. H. = 7-7.5; G. = 2.98-3.2.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tests.</span> To be recognized
      usually by the characteristic rounded triangular cross section of
      the crystals; absence of prismatic cleavage, coal-like fracture of
      black variety.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Occurrence</span>. Tourmalinc is
      one of the most common and characteristic minerals formed by
      pneumatolytic action. That is, it is a mineral that has been
      formed at high temperatures and pressures through the agency of
      vapors carrying boron, fluorine, ete. It is found, there fore,
      commonly as an accessory mineral in pegmatite veins, 01' dikes,
      occurring with granite intrusions. Associated with the ordinary
      minerals of granite pegmatite, orthoclase, albite, quartz and
      muscovite; also with lepidolite, beryl, apatite, fluorite, ete.<br>
      <br>
      Found also as an accessory mineral in metamorphie roeks, such as
      gneisses, schists and crystalline limestones.<br>
      <br>
      The black tourmaline is of widespread occurrence as an accessory
      mineral in metamorphie rock. The light colored gem varieties are
      found in the pegmatite dikes. Famous localities for the occurrence
      of the gem tourmalines are the island of Elba; in the state of
      Minas Geraes, Brazil; Ural Mountains near Ekaterinburg;
      Madagasear; Paris and Auburn, Maine Chesterfield, Massachusetts;
      Haddam Neck, Connecticut; Mesa Grande, Pala, Rincon and Ramona in
      San Diego County, California. Brown crystals are found near
      Gouverneur, New York and fine black crystals at Pierrepont, New
      York.<br>
