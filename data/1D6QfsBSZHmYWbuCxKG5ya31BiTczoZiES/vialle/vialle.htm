        <div align="left"> I realized an interview of the retired
          physicist Richard VIALLE ( in French), presenting his negative
          mass theory, a new model of gravity and of the mass and its
          applications to antigravity and overunity production of
          electric power.<br>
          <br>
        </div>
        Richard VIALLE has elaborated his theory in the beginning of the
        80's but as an exceptional fact he also has realized many
        experiments showing the validity of the theory. He got
        gravitational anomalies and has created an overunity generator
        (free energy) running successfully according to his theory.
        These devices have been replicated and tested independently
        successfully.<br>
        <br>
        Richard VIALLE first presents us his theory, its basis and
        foundations and the computations explaining it in a large part
        of the interview (many videos), then he explains the way the
        devices he invented work, their schematic and the way to
        reproduce them. Movies showing these devices working are
        included, concerning gravity anomalies (negative mass) and
        overunity.<br>

          This interview is the testimony given by Richard VIALLE to
          mankind, the sum of almost 30 years of work which has been so
          slightly spread up to now. He doesn't want to make money with
          it or being glorified; he only wants to spread these ideas so
          they could be used freely by everybody willing to reproduce
          the devices and use it for a progress. He is a man with a
          great ideal.<br>

          <br>
          Richard VIALLE\ is a former research physicist whose theories
          based on classical physics to which he adds a further
          assumption allowed him to build a brand new physics.<br>
          <br>
          It explains the origin of gravity, mass, defines the negative
          masses, and the consequences are incalculable (cosmological
          definition of load, time, etc).<br>
          <br>
          Everything is based on the existence of a fluid situated
          outside our dimensions between constantly in our three spatial
          dimensions, for flow. This fluid, incompressible flows in a
          law that will match all calculations, the law of propagation
          of a particle subject to the force of gravity. It is according
          to Richard VIALLE the origin of gravitation.<br>
          <br>
          I started to write an article about the theory of Richard
          VIALLE form pedagogical explanatory, allowing to understand
          the meaning. Richard VIALLE wrote a summary of his theory and
          a number of annexes calculations, but the meaning of the work
          done, assumptions and interpretations are not indicated. It is
          precisely this work that I started missing with the beginning
          of the unfinished article, based on information provided to me
          after I asked him for months on numerous occasions to clarify
          its work and give coherence to someone who is not like him,
          plunged into it.<br>
          <br>
          I quickly finished the sentence suspended sen left to complete
          the current paragraph writing. If I have time for that I shall
          finish this later. We already have a good idea of ??what it is
          of fundamental principles of its work. It certainly still many
          things including his concepts of electrical ground, and other
          mass concept he defined for convenience of work equivalence
          with mechanical principles. He works a lot by analogy with
          mechanics.<br>

          According to the theory of Richard VIALLE, any body set in
          motion a mass acceleration defined as a conventional mass to
          which is added a component having the dimension of a mass, but
          can be negative or positive. This is due to a relativistic
          calculation described in his theory.<br>
          <br>
          So if you accelerate system somehow, its mass will not be the
          traditional mass (already assigned for its coefficient of
          relativistic) but a different mass, which may be smaller due
          to the "negative mass" and added .<br>
          <br>
          From his theory, Richard has produced VIALLE experience,
          experience called "balance experiment." Its scale is a
          balanced system of rod placed on axis, allowing the rotation
          (like a Roberval balance). One side contains a counterweight,
          and the other contains a full disk. This disc is rotated by a
          motor whose speed is controlled with an electronic servo
          controlled in order to move the rotating disc in a clear
          acceleration equation (it describes the control disk rotation
          in his summary, 16 pages to 22a)<br>
          <br>
          The expected acceleration equation simplifies calculations in
          terms of negative mass and provide for the creation of
          negative mass in a very precise dynamic evolution. The disc
          rotates rotated in a transparent plastic box in order not to
          have the phenomenon of movement of air set in motion by the
          rotation and disturbing its operation. At rest the balance
          system perfectly balances mass and negative mass produces an
          effect of imbalance, which causes it to raise additional set
          if the mass is negative. This is what happens in their
          experience.<br>
          <br>
          He was able to control not only the balance but it does raise
          the dynamics trajectory accurately predicted by the theory. If
          the disk rotates at a constant speed nothing happens, it is
          necessary acceleration.<br>
          <br>
          I could see his balance work and unfortunately at that time I
          had not released the video device. So I have a video that I
          spent working, which is very average but showing the system.<br>
          <br>
          He presented the balance 25 years ago peers at university.
          None could find out what made it lift, although tried to think
          of different effects. cons but instead to focus on this, they
          were blind, not interested, because it would necessarily be
          explained by the known laws, even if they were unable to say
          how many ... known laws do not explain precisely. Continuing
          to insist, to produce a conference to present his work
          colleagues decided that all this was their task on high
          prestige scientific proponents of the dogmas of science. They
          succeeded in making administrative pressures that led to the
          forced retirement of Richard VIALLE <big>at a</big> young
          age, in his forties.<br>
          <br>
          Since then he has continued his work and glimpsed other
          consequences of his theory. This is the same theory that led
          him to develop a different experience to see a gravitational
          anomaly, which I'll explain here, and I've tested.<br>
          <br>
          He also, with the same theory always able to build an
          over-unity electric generator. Left behind for 30 years should
          not rely on public services to support it. He was able to find
          private sponsors with whom he was linked to this development.<br>
          <br>
          However, it has been derived yet another different system,
          always using the principles of his theory, producing
          electrical energy so over-unity. I have also been able to
          reproduce this work and the effects we have seen together: we
          manage to reduce the consumption of input when the output
          produces an excess of energy.<br>
          <br>
          The results of the first exit were modest so far, enough to
          light a flashlight only (with an outfit worthy of the heavy
          hammer to achieve this result and wasting hundreds of watts in
          power supplies used to power any laboratory this), it remains
          only a principle experimental development that requires yet.<br>
          <br>
          But over-unity was measured and is by appointment. This is
          exceptional and measured!<br>
          <br>
          Experiments have shown since the possibility to extract much
          more energy and circuitry dedicated steering eliminates
          hundreds of watts of laboratory apparatus. It is gradually
          approaching a usable system.<br>

          For the electronic scale there is no levitation; this is not a
          loss of mass that is actually entered, but an anomaly that
          disrupts the bridge resistances of tensile testing of the
          balance. The balance of tensile testing serves as a bridge or
          ohmmeter improved. This is an electronic problem.<br>
          <br>
          The effects of change in resistance due to the negative mass
          generates a center of gravity that additional changes the
          overall center of gravity of the pigtail, according to the
          theory of Richard.<br>
          <br>
          Displayed negative mass is again not a decrease in mass at
          all. The question is whether, in addition to the effect of
          change in resistance that occurs, how the RF signal going back
          through the filter of the multimeter or Wheatstone bridge deck
          for tensile testing of electronic balance, cause disturbance
          of the control electronics (HF currents induced in the chips).
          There is a part of electronic disturbance pure radiation and
          by modifying the strength of the material sensor.<br>
          <br>
          Where there was evidence of a change in the position of the
          center of gravity is precisely with the balance Roberval;
          mechanical it has just been done. Electronic scale can explain
          how search frequency anomaly. We have a range of 3 to 5MHz to
          observe anomalies, with a peak not too sharp anyway.<br>
          <br>
          Electronic balance proves nothing in itself because it has
          added two phenomena, but that of Roberval is the sinews of
          war. Tests revolve around it. The change in resistance is a
          plus.<br>

          defines the rest.<br>
          <br>
          M '= alpha. M. gamma M: classical gravitational mass<br>
          1/racine gamma = (1-v  / c ) = 1 for some non-relativistic
          particle<br>
          So in the nonrelativistic case we have:<br>
          <br>
          M '= alpha. M<br>
          <br>
          and alpha is calculated as being equal to:<br>
          alpha = 1-x/2-x  / 2 where x is a coefficient which is
          calculated using the equation of acceleration<br>
          <br>
          So we get:<br>
          M '= (1-x/2-x  / 2). M = M-M. (X / 2 + x  / 2) = M-delta (M)<br>
          delta (M) represents the negative weight is calculated as a
          fraction of the mass M at rest.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore any mass M undergoing acceleration will behave as a
          mass M '= M-delta (M) will be different from the mass M at
          rest.<br>
          <br>
          And as delta (M) can take values ??greater if we arrange for
          that, we can make delta (M) = M which case M = 0, ie the mass
          is degravitation (levitation) . With delta (M)&gt; M we even
          repulsion (antigravity).<br>
          <br>
          When I say we can arrange for delta (M) large, and that means
          get a large x and this is achieved for high acceleration. So
          you need technical prowess acceleration for effects
          degravitation total.<br>
          <br>
          Experience the balance of Richard V. illustration of this is
          the case (but without acceleration prowess that would fly the
          balance). The equation mounted disk speed is calculated for x
          to be a constant (x depends on the time normally for quite
          some acceleration).<br>
          <br>
          Thus in the case of the scale, alpha is constant and negative
          mass created is constant. The scale is balanced to compensate
          and delta M (M) manifests itself by a imbalance. This
          imbalance following the repulsion of negative mass consistent
          with the Earth .. This is true in the time measurements
          trajectory balance justly according to the law under
          acceleration calculated. According to another law does not
          balance this behavior uniform which supports the theory of
          Richard, not only the balance rises under the action of a
          delta (M), but it is well calculated according to the law by
          Richard V.<br>
          <br>
          For the pigtail, the principle is very different cons. Richard
          V. finally determined that any sending system flow ether is a
          system having a mass. The mass is precisely measuring the
          leakage of the flow of ether. It defines the speed of gravity
          as the escape velocity of the flow. It is equal to the speed
          of light at the surface of the core area of ??the exhaust
          stream (radius R0 of his theory, surface vortex transmitter
          ether in our three dimensions from the fourth dimension) from
          the core material and slows down with distance.<br>
          <br>
          It seems that there are also waves in the flow of ether. They
          spread the gravitation speed of light and are characterized by
          the gravitational attraction the mass attracts mass or Repulse
          through waves that travel flows. But this requires that these
          flows are first connected, they are interpenetrated (joined in
          some way, which can be very long knowing that flow away
          slowing down more gradually as that it away, even very very
          slowly far enough, it can take hundreds of years to the flow
          of the center of the earth comes to the surface, but reassure
          us, the Earth has been around longer, so everything is bathed
          in, and vice versa, matter that exists is long enough that its
          flow has reached any earthly object).<br>
          <br>
          But it was determined that an electric field or a magnetic
          field is accompanied by a flow of ether. The electric charge
          is according to the theory of Richard V. an indicator of the
          entry point of the flow from the fourth dimension ether. An
          electric field is a marker of the presence of electric
          charges, so the flow stream of ether.<br>
          <br>
          So when there is an electric field, there is a flow of ether,
          and thus an equivalent mass. He calls this mass of "effective
          mass". But this mass there (which is just equivalent to the
          flow of leaking ether locally in our dimensions) is not
          gravitational mass, which is subject to gravitational
          attraction. The idea of Richard about this is that the flow of
          newly ether led by the electric field propagates too slowly to
          reach the center of the Earth to connect to the emission flux
          and interactions produce waves that s 'exchange really, or
          that stream, which seems to disappear with the electric field
          in the presence of conductive material which disperses is no
          longer there ... the cause is not yet clear.<br>
          <br>
          But the fact is: the effective mass supply is not subject to
          the Earth's gravitational attraction (experimental fact. In
          the theory of Richard V.; several things are not experimental
          facts and theoretical assumptions, when tested previously
          made; theory therefore built with support points
          experimental).<br>
          <br>
          The pigtail is wound to power the system by HF current whose
          frequency is calculated relative to the size of the internal
          thread of 6mm  to excite electrons orbiting peripherally.
          These electrons are excited into resonance sinusoidal
          agitation and away and approach movement of the core back and
          forth with an amplitude which is increasing at resonance. So
          we have a resonant effect. Richard V. an equation for
          calculating the resonant frequency, which is not in the
          documents that I have provided, I have on notepads, from its
          reasoning. For 6mm  wire gives a frequency near 160MHz memory
          (the formula is empirical part, using a specific measure that
          needs to be refined). It is not random party on 165MHz: he
          looked around the calculated frequency.<br>
          <br>
          To lower the frequency, increase the diameter of the wire
          section. For down to reasonable values in kilohertz should be
          of diameter to tens of meters (impossible!!)<br>
          <br>
          The electrons thus excited will produce a coherent electric
          field oscillating between the nucleus and the electrons and
          this field (its rms value; averaged sinusoids) which will
          create the issuance of ether, creating an effective mass
          electric. So pigtail creates effective mass at the right
          frequency by a resonance effect. Finally it's Keely with EM
          fields to excite ether (personal observation).<br>
          <br>
          But as has been said here this mass does not cause repulsion
          of the Earth is not gravitational mass. So do not expect to
          use it to lift anything. To lift something you need to use the
          principle of the rotating disk.<br>
          <br>
          However, the effective mass created obeys the laws he
          established the masses: the mass created can be negative as
          well. And there with electric fields it is easy to calculate
          that for electrons created negative mass is very large, much
          more than the mass of material containing these electrons. So
          we can create an intense negative ground if desired, but it is
          nothing a priori because this mass is neither attraction nor
          repulsion of gravity. It was still a phenomenon at the time of
          startup and shutdown of the system then the negative mass is
          created or destroyed, and this appears to emit a gravitational
          wave which propagates in her flow and ambient ether is
          detected: this is the "reaction" of the negative effective
          mass created by Richard: it is drawn.<br>
          <br>
          The theory says that once Richard negative mass created, its
          ether flow is attracted by gravity produced by the local
          center of the earth in which it is immersed, because the flow
          of the Earth reaches us from the time that exists (this flow
          is slow Earth's surface) and so it has not been able to reach
          the center of the Earth to connect to the vortex to create the
          repulsive force in return as the only force between the Earth
          and the mass there, like any good negative ground should be
          done according to our concepts, it will also be drawn as if it
          were a positive mass. It is therefore drawn as positive by the
          local ground and pushed also by the local, but these will
          cease (or will be less prevalent) when a connection is
          established between the vortex. Probably this connection
          allows the passage of gravitational waves between them and
          these waves will predominate cause for Newtonian effects. It
          will therefore be rejected locally by the fact that it is a
          negative ground. These local effects are not binding effects
          with the vortex center R0 land. It does not seem to be capable
          of emitting gravitational waves to create the link to the
          speed of light and the only repulsion and undergo back.<br>
          <br>
          This means that negative mass is both drawn (the "reaction",
          not just ignition and extinction) and extended: that's what
          makes it no use to us this effective mass electric. This
          causes it again differ from the gravitational mass which is
          capable of producing these gravitational waves at the speed of
          light and behave as a mass which cooperates with a single
          component: attraction and repulsion if positive if negative.<br>
          <br>
          All this is not very clear to me, Richard seems to find a
          coherent explanation for this subject as me, but it still
          lacks things to understand. It's research is the explanation
          may not be correct.<br>
          <br>
          One thing is interesting cons: the center of gravity of the
          system is changed. We can calculate the position of the center
          of gravity of the entire system as the center of gravity of
          the weight is assigned negative negative mass and mass of the
          negative mass affected by positive "response", so that the
          mass of material constituting the remainder of the pigtail.<br>
          <br>
          But what is interesting, is that the point of application of
          the forces of attraction of positive masses is the center of
          gravity of the solid is not the same as that of negative mass
          is the centroid of electrons oscillating. The center of
          gravity of the solid can be modified by adding various pieces
          of cardboard and wooden rods or other hanging to one side, in
          which case it is not the geometric center of the pigtail. It
          has been tested by changing the position of the center of
          gravity of the solid Roberval balance with such processes. One
          can also change the position of the center of gravity relative
          to the center of the Earth by placing the pigtail higher or
          lower (counts is the ratio of the distances between the two
          centers of gravity; report changes when climbing or down the
          pigtail, hence the idea to lift up or to switch the trays down
          or up initially).<br>
          <br>
          However, the negative mass has its application center at the
          geometric center of the pigtail, which is the geometric center
          of all the excited electrons. The fact create this distance
          between the two centers of gravity or to change the position
          that the equivalent mass of gravity (center of gravity is to
          the gravitational masses) of the entire system (assigned to
          its center of gravity total) equals a coefficient that is
          equal, by calculating the relative positions of the two
          centers of gravity relative to the center of the earth (it is
          shown by the calculations of Richard V., again not in its
          documents, notes elsewhere). Therefore the system behaves as
          if its total mass gravitational varied; through this distance
          from the center of gravity of the pigtail its geometric
          center.<br>
          <br>
          So in the end we measure gravitational mass depends on whether
          the centers of gravity are at different positions relative to
          the center of the Earth.<br>
          <br>
          This explanation, according to Richard the idea of how his
          pigtail works. So do not expect miracles, but by increasing
          the distance between the center of gravity can be obtained
          more significant results.<br>
          <br>
          There are many things that Richard is also in limbo. Why
          effective electrical ground is not working as gravitational
          mass: it is found experimentally, but not explained. How the
          connection between the vortex R01 particulate matter causes
          gravitational link and why not if, etc.. He touched the ideas
          about it, but nothing is final. It has the merit of being able
          to offer the experience at the end of the theory and has given
          a result, both for its balance imbalance for the pigtail, and
          the effects calculated for the balance imbalance to correspond
          to the equations of the theory, and also that the same ideas
          are applied to the successful completion of the electrical
          generator.<br>
          <br>
          It has powerful intuitions. It is believed to be able to apply
          the principle of the mechanical oscillation of the electrons
          special capacitor to produce the levitation force multiplied
          by the balance of 1000 or more and levitate an object using
          electrical principles not to produce a mass effective
          electrical but to use mechanical acceleration of the electrons
          excited around the core. Indeed these electrons mechanically
          actuated by the electric fields have a movement acceleration
          and produce them, a true negative gravitational mass. but
          calculations show that there is negligible mass and does not
          play a role in the pigtail.<br>
          <br>
          However with special capacitors; where the electrical
          permittivity values reach hitherto unmatched (materials that
          appear to exist in the field of research) by creating a sphere
          condenser (capacitor between the center and outer surface with
          high permittivity dielectric between the two) and he applies
          his theory by injecting an RF signal at the right frequency
          and voltage successful on paper to really levitate stuff.
          Until then his ideas on paper proved true. For him it is the
          next step: a real antigravity effective. Hardware issue now.
          it's been 1 year and a half on the idea that there is<br>
          <br>
          Although less spectacular than the rotating disc, I find that
          the experience of the pigtail is much more interesting from a
          theoretical point of view is research on a real hole in space
          or QDC weighs more according to the same angle of equilibrium.
          An idea to the con, but hey, I wonder if we had to make a
          quarter turn to the balance if the phenomenon was still
          present? Determine if the object or space that changes
          according to the results and to return the balance to the
          initial point. The idea is that gravity or atmosphere in this
          place do not have the same properties (like a hole, a small
          hole for a while)<br>
          <br>
          You get a static, without mechanical rotation.<br>
          <br>
          For the pigtail, it has been the Roberval balance in the same
          place, but before that (and after that as well) was tested
          with another Roberval balance had Richard, who was also on the
          table with his pigtail memory effect. This is the pigtail
          effect that carries with him.<br>
          <br>
          In the theory of Richard there emerges a ball ether issued by
          the pigtail, which is negative ground. The ball, which he
          calls "bubble" is attached to the pigtail and moves with it.
          With pigtail memory effect (which turned long) this bubble
          continues to exist all the time. She did not say anything
          empty. It contains energy (amount of ether) so important for
          cumulative effect, it never resolves (in fact I think it takes
          a long time for that ultra reaches the completely empty).
          Pigtail without memory effect, it is the same principle,
          except that the duration of power is low and the bubble
          creates a small volume of ether. When you cut it empties too
          slowly, but the volume created is so small that it is finally
          completely empty fast enough.<br>
          <br>
          So pigtail carries with it the bubble. One can indeed wonder
          if the bubble leaves traces in space (empty if traces of their
          footprint ether). Hard to say and not tested.<br>
          <br>
          But there is even more fantastic! The weather changes.<br>
          <br>
          Richard showed in his theory that the time measured locally in
          the "bubble" change. This is part of its equations.<br>
          <br>
          He therefore tried to test it on several occasions. I brought
          an hourglass kitchen last time, but an hourglass that takes
          30sec to flow with an accuracy of 2s .... much that I did not
          measured. I wanted a non-electronic and could not find a style
          purely mechanical watch last century.<br>
          <br>
          Richard was able to test over several hours and observe an
          offset time measurement between an electronic watch with
          quartz placed in the field of the bubble; nearby, several tens
          of centimeters and another on the outside (to the one to
          Outside he uses his computer is plugging into the website that
          gives GMT copied atomic clock, it has the advantage of reading
          a time that is always accurate and precise and independent
          away from the measurement location to final).<br>
          <br>
          Noting the early hours of experience in the watch and clock
          atomic finds it after a few hours the quartz accuses several
          seconds faster than the atomic clock at the end of test.<br>
          <br>
          He repeated the experience away from the machine, outside of
          any "bubble" and the same time he looks at what is the lag of
          the watch (which as all watches is never exact) and makes the
          difference: there are many more seconds apart, which means
          that the quartz watch has really slowed more in the area of
          exposure to the bubble to its normal rhythm.<br>
          <br>
          But for me this is not significant, it was seen that the
          pigtail emits EM waves with a certain power removed, so it
          disturbs the logical electronic watch and it is not
          significant; hence the idea of finding a pure mechanical
          clock.<br>
          <br>
          He was able to administer a stopwatch style old; without
          internal electronics and repeated the experiment with a
          witness (who lent him the mechanical clock).<br>
          <br>
          Over a period of 3 hours of operation of the pigtail,
          mechanical chrono located a few tens of centimeters of the
          tail e pig operation, the clock accuses 8 seconds less than
          the atomic clock at the end of test. same experience rebuilt
          away from the machine, machine cut, the accused 1s chrono less
          than the atomic clock. So it accredits highly weather
          modification under Richard.<br>
          <br>
          What is interesting with the theory of Richard, is that
          everything comes from a single initial premise with added
          significance, the entry of a fluid in our dimensions, and for
          the rest it uses classical physics without change. But that
          his whole theory is built as a result of this single point has
          implications for mass, time, etc. he sought to verify these
          multiple points and independent a priori seem to be true. This
          is the same theory he developed are also self-perpetuating;
          same principle.<br>
          <br>
          Should be very extensive further testing of the time change.
          Chrono test with several mechanical, electronic (atomic
          quartz) and test several varying distances from the pigtail to
          test a law of diminishing time depending on the distance,
          etc.. All this remains to be done and is exciting to be
          tested.<br>
          <br>
          I recall that the idea is just Richard others reproduce its
          assembly to test the veracity of his claims and more
          experimental, and discover how it works, it has indeed worked
          very theory but has yet to improve to explain unknown points
          and prove that these anomalous effects are good as he says
          reproducing.<br>

          Richard V. made other tests with the pigtail, outside of the

          will call Alain B.) in my archives and you see here:<br>
          <br>
          Acceleration of the flywheel cut:<br>
          <br>
          A motor composed of a steering wheel turns in on itself under
          the pigtail fed. A photoelectric cell counts the number of
          revolutions of the engine.<br>
          <br>
          The detection is connected to a frequency meter. One reads the
          rotational frequency here.<br>
          <br>
          The pigtail is supplied over during this time. Then cuts power
          to the pigtail ... the engine is then subjected to brief
          acceleration, it is read on the frequency in a short time.
          Then the engine starts to turn to normal.<br>
          <br>
          This is the reaction of the negative mass flywheel which thus
          manifests itself, reducing its mass for a fraction of a second
          (which is conductive screen located below the engine for those
          who think to harm a induction in the motor winding. induction
          .. especially with a 165MHz engine ....).<br>
          <br>
          Response on the oscilloscope accelerometer:<br>
          <br>
          The pigtail is placed above an accelerometer. The principle of
          this electronic accelerometer is explained in another video.
          Must be supplied by the accelerometer housing (gray wire in
          the picture is connected to the gray box behind it will
          clarify the other video explanation of the accelerometer) and
          measure the voltage output on another gray wire that goes to
          the box and returns the measured voltage via the box to an
          outlet (on the photo output is connected to a multimeter and
          it is this output is then connected to the oscilloscope)<br>
          <br>
          Connection of accelerometer on a cathode ray oscilloscope with
          slow scan. Throughout the beginning of the experiment, the CRT
          heater and sudden movements of the beam is not visible damage.
          So we do not see the sudden jump after powering the pigtail.
          But seen against the sudden jump after switching off the
          pigtail. This jump in the accelerometer is the sign of the
          reaction mass is negative for a fraction of a second without
          compensation and causes a detectable negative ground.<br>
          <br>
          During operation of the pigtail can be seen that the voltage
          reading (measurement of the accelerometer) on the oscilloscope
          is a constant value above the reference off (it was originally
          set up on the line of zero volts oscilloscope). This is most
          likely due to the phenomenon already repeatedly observed that
          the resistance of materials exchange, exposed to the pigtail.
          The winding resistance of the accelerometer changing, the
          measured value of the terminal voltage is no longer the
          original one. What is interesting is the surge voltage after
          power, after returning to the initial value at the end of
          video, show the reaction of negative mass (and again, this
          takes place AFTER power off the tail pig, not immediately, you
          can not talk artifact induction in HF devices ...)<br>
          <br>
          A video where I was present (with Alain and Richard B. V.),
          and another accelerometer, here is the explanation of the
          principle:<br>
          <br>
          Electronic accelerometer: explanations operation. It is
          powered by an electronic system and produces a measurable
          voltage (because it is powered by a housing provided for this)
          which depends on the local gravity that attracts an internal
          mass which moves in a sense coil. The rest in the video.<br>

          I just suddenly realized ... just take the transmitter GM300
          and not throw the transmitter part! Just keep the transmitter
          and that whole issue without modulating, mute the microphone
          input for the carrier only. The frequency is not adjustable in
          the range 20/25/30KHz 146 to 174MHz.<br>
          <br>
          So the solution was all stupid and cheap. Not require the
          generator or transmitter to tinker too.<br>
          <br>
          Why I did not think of this before? While reading the message
          Obelix who says amateur radio transmit power and in the right
          frequency in 100Watts.<br>
          <br>
          So we have the SOLUTION for a CHEAP power everything easily: a
          transmitter that works and mute the microphone input as a
          modulation source.<br>
