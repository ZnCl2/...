        seeds to increase germination speed. The germination speed of
        seeds is increased by moving the seeds in a helical path through
        a magnetic field, or other field produced by a source of
        electric, magnetic or electromagnetic energy. As shown, a screw
        conveyer 20 conveys the seeds from an inlet chamber 16, which is
        supplied by a hopper 10 via a control slide 14, to an outlet
        chamber 24, the seeds being caused by the centrifugal force to
        move in a helical path along the inside wall of a plastic tube
        22 past an electromagnet 38 surrounding the tube, so as to be
        subjected to a magnetic field while the seed is both moved in a
        helical path and is at the same time rolled to expose several
        surfaces of the seed to the field. The treated seeds are
        collected in a collector 26. The electromagnet 38 may be
        replaced by electric field generating means, or by X-ray, high
        frequency, microwave or other electromagnetic field generating
        means.<br>

        germination suppressing agent represented by 39% solution of
        maleic hydrazide for suppressing the germination of garlic. ;
        SOLUTION: The sprouting part and the root part of a garlic are
        subjected to predrying treatment at &gt;=30[deg.]C for &gt;=3
        days after harvest and irradiated with continuous or pulse
        electromagnetic radiation to suppress the germination of the

        easily at a low cost simply by treating the sprouting part or
        the root part of garlic with electromagnetic wave harmless to
        food or with ethyl alcohol known as a safe additive.
        Furthermore, the germination suppressing treatment of garlic is
        carried out by specifically combining the hitherto separately

        model relates to a dielectric seeds grader through which the
        seeds can be graded and separated according to the activity of
        the seeds. The utility model is characterized in that the seeds
        are scattered on a dielectric roller whose surface is wound with
        a conducting wire through an electromagnetic vibrator and a seed
        guiding sliding plate; the conducting wire is connected with an
        alternate current voltage regulator through an electric brush,
        and is supplied with the alternate current which is from 1000V
        to 5000V. The surface of the roller grades the seeds having
        different activities according to the dielectric property of the
        seeds. The seeds grader using the dielectric roller as a grading
        component has the advantages of high grading purity and low
        energy consumption; the seeds can not be damaged; the seed
        germination rate can be improved during grading.<br>

        Inventor: James Y. Johnson<br>

        1934-09-28<br>
        Abstract -- Changes in the energy content of dipolar substances
        are produced by exposure to a concentrated electromagnetic field
        having one or more frequencies corresponding to wavelengths
        between 3 mm. and 6 metres approximately and equal to
        characteristic periods of the substances treated. The process
        applies to naturally dipolar substances and to those in which
        dipoles can be induced by a field. The characteristic periods of
        the substances are of three kinds depending respectively on (1)
        the relaxation time of the dipoles when orientated by the field,
        (2) the natural oscillation-period of the dipoles, (3) the
        term-difference frequencies of the atoms. They are associated
        with anomalous variations in the optical and dielectric
        properties and can be found by examining those properties in a
        field of varying frequency. They can be varied within limits by
        changing the temperature, pressure, concentration, &amp;c., and
        may thus be adjusted to correspond exactly with a field of
        approximately correct frequency. The fields may be standing ones
        produced between conductors such as concentric tubes or the
        plate resonators described in Specification 417,564, or radiated
        fields concentrated by reflectors. They may comprise several
        different frequencies and constant electrostatic fields may be
        superimposed on them. The exposure may be continuous or
        intermittent and different frequencies may be applied in
        succession. The invention is not concerned with the production
        of merely transitory effects and temperature changes, but with
        more permanent physical and chemical effects of which the
        following are examples:-- Colloidal dispersions and emulsions
        are stabilised or further dispersed by short exposure but
        prolonged treatment produces coagulation. An agar-agar gel
        exposed to a field of 116 cm. wavelength increases in mobility
        after 10 minutes and becomes more viscous after several hours.
        Crystallization is stimulated by the use of a varying field.
        Preservation of organic materials is effected preferably by
        intermittent exposure, e.g. veal after 3 minutes treatment with
        a field comprising four selected frequencies remains fresh for 2
        weeks, or longer if further exposure to a weaker field is given
        for 5 minutes in each hour. Milk and apple juice may be
        similarly treated. Medical diagnosis and treatment.
        Cell-division may be stimulated and other beneficial effects
        produced in living bodies. The method of determining the
        characteristic frequencies of the constituents of a living body
        provides a means of diagnosis. Fermentation processes and other
        processes involving bacteria may be modified by influencing the
        bacteria or their nutrient medium. <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">Germination of seeds may be accelerated. Bean seeds
          previously swollen and exposed for 30 sec. to suitable fields
          germinate twice as fast as untreated seeds.</span> Electrets
        may be produced by subjecting a fluid dielectric to a field and
        then solidifying it by freezing, evaporation, or coagulation.
        Medicines for internal and external use may have electrets
        incorporated in them, the electrical energy being released upon
        their application. A plaster comprising euphorbium powder, fine
        resin, yellow wax, and turpentine may be exposed at 85 DEG C. to
        a field of 235 cm. wavelength and then cooled to 15 DEG C.
        Disinfecting pastilles comprising beeswax and gums and the usual
        drugs may be similarly treated. Photographic plates may be
        rendered more sensitive especially in the red and infra-red by
        exposure to the fields. Chemical reactions may be promoted and
        facilitated. Examples are: (1) the conversion of acetylene,
        steam, and ozone into acetic acid and acetaldehyde without a
        catalyst; (2) the drying of lacquers and varnishes; (3) the
        consolidation of styrol; (4) the hardening of Bakelite; (5) the
        polymerization of isoprene; (6) the vulcanization of rubber.
        Artificial silk may be stabilized by treatment as it leaves the
        spinning nozzle.ALSO:Chemical reactions are promoted or
        accelerated by exposure of dipolar substances to a concentrated
        electromagnetic field having one or more frequencies

        substances treated. The process applies to naturally dipolar

        variations in the optical and dielectric properties and can be
        found by examining these properties in a field of varying
        frequency. The fields may be standing ones produced between
        conductors such as concentric tubes or the plate resonators
        described in Specification 417,564, [Group XL], or radiated
        fields concentrated by reflectors. Several different frequencies
        may be applied simultaneously or in succession and either
        constantly or intermittently, and constant electrostatic fields
        may be superimposed on them. The following examples of reactions
        are mentioned, viz.:-- Synthetic rubber is produced by
        polymerization of isoprene. Phenol-aldehyde condensation
        products, styrol, &amp;c. are hardened. The drying of lacquers,
        varnishes &amp;c. is accelerated. Acetaldehyde and acetic acid
        are obtained by the reaction of acetylene, steam, and ozone
        without a catalyst. Artificial silk is hardened by treatment of
        the material as it leaves the spinning nozzles. The product
        shows increased resistance to wear. <span style="font-weight:
          bold;">ALSO: The germination of seeds is accelarated by
          exposure to a concentrated electromagnetic field having one or

          to an example, bean seeds previously swollen are treated for
          30 seconds at 35 DEG C. with a field comprising wave lengths

              Of Seeds By A Pulsed Magnetic Field: A New Technique In
              Crop Production</span></big><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        </div>
        <br>
        <div><img src="elculture1.jpg" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        The new technique of presowing treatment of seeds is based on
        their irradiation by a pulsed magnetic field. It speeds seed
        germination, stimulates further plant growth, and increases
        grain and vegetable yields. The method is environmentally clean
        and has a low energy consumption.<br>
        <br>
        Highly efficient installations have been developed for the
        large-scale use of the technique of the presowing pulsed
        magnetic field treatment (PMFT) of seeds in crop production. The
        method has been tested with success in the Central Black-Earth
        Area of Russia over the past five years. The mutational
        variability of plants grown with the use of presowing PMFT did
        not exceed the natural background for conventionally grown
        plants.<br>
        <br>
        The stimulating effect of presowing PMFT is manifested in a
        change of the thermogenesis parameters at early stages of seed
        germination. The time-dependences of the temperature changes of
        the germinating seeds indicate that presowing PMFT shortens the
        duration of physico-chemical thermogenesis and increases the
        amplitude of the thermal fluctuations of biological
        thermogenesis. <br>
        <br>
        The PMFT installation consists of a small generator of electric
        pulses and a source of a magnetic field (an operating chamber in
        the form of a solenoid coil).The seeds are subjected to the PMF
        treatment as they are poured through the operating chamber. The
        installation, intended for use in production conditions, has the
        following technical specifications:<br>
        <br>
        power supply ................................................
        220V, 50Hz or 110V, 60 Hz<br>
        intake power&nbsp;
        ................................................. 50 VA<br>
        capacity&nbsp;
        ...................................................... 10 tons
        per hour<br>
        <br>
        operating chamber dimensions:<br>
        <br>
        diameter........................................... 200 mm<br>
        length ............................................... 500 mm<br>
        weight ...............................................&nbsp; 6
        kg<br>
        <br>
        duration of continuous operation -- unlimited.<br>
        <br>
        The PMFT-induced effects are very sensitive to the parameters of
        the magnetic pulses and operating mode. The PMFT parameters and
        magnetic treatment modes constitute the know-how of the
        technique.<br>
        <br>
        The proposed method of PMF seed treatment stimulates seed
        germination and can therefore be used to increase the field
        germination rates of seeds and, hence, their price. The
        treatment suppresses the spread of root rot and is an
        alternative to fungicide treatment of the seeds. Presowing PMFT
        enhances plant vitality and yield, the treatment being most
        effective on fertile and fertilized soils.<br>
        <br>
        The proposed technique can also be used in the food industry,
        specifically to hasten barley seed sprouting in beer production.
        The R&amp;D involved in the technique has been completed, and it
        can now be employed on a large scale. The method has been
        successfully tested on farms in the Voronezh, Lipetsk, Nizhny
        Novgorod, and Moscow regions. Highly efficient installations
        have been developed to implement the method.<br>
