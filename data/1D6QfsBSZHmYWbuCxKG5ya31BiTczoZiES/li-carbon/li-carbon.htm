      A new conductive cotton fabric able to store energy could help
      power the new generation of flexible electronics and medical
      implants.<br>
      <br>
      Xiaodong Li, a mechanical engineering professor at the University
      of South Carolina, created the highly conductive cotton by soaking
      a $5 cotton T-shirt in a sodium fluoride solution for an hour and
      then drying it at two different levels of heat, which changed the
      cotton to activate carbon. The still-flexible material was then
      coated with a nano-layer of metal manganese oxide, transforming
      the fabric to a super capacitor with 97.3 percent retention.<br>
      <br>
      The process is inexpensive and eco-friendly, costing up to 10
      times less than processing coal or petroleum into activated
      carbon.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE GIST</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      * Using a simple process, University of South Carolina engineers
      baked a cotton T-shirt into activated carbon.<br>
      * By adding a thin conductive metal layer, they created a stable,
      high performing super capacitor.<br>
      * The engineers envision using cotton for energy storage in
      flexible electronics, roll-up displays, and implanted medical
      devices. Cotton T-shirts of the future could do double duty by
      keeping people cool and dry while at the same charging their
      phones. Click to enlarge this image.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      One day, donning a T-shirt could mean you're also sporting a smart
      device charger. Engineers have successfully transformed cotton
      into a flexible, highly conductive component, which means it could
      charge devices.<br>
      <br>
      "In the future, you can imagine our cell phones will be just like
      a piece of paper you can roll up. But we need to have a flexible
      energy device to integrate with flexible, stretchable
      motherboards," said Xiaodong Li, a mechanical engineering
      professor at the University of South Carolina who led the
      development with postdoc Lihong Bao. Their article was just
      published in the journal Advanced Materials (abstract).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Li knows how to be creative with cotton T-shirts. In 2010, he and
      his colleagues converted one into lightweight body armor by
      converting the fabric into boron carbide nanowires. So when he
      began looking for a backbone to make a flexible energy storage
      device, he turned to a $5 cotton tee from Wal-Mart.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The engineers had to make the cotton highly conductive so they
      tried several "recipes," Li said. He compared their experiments
      with trying to replicate a restaurant meal at home without having
      seen the chef's preparations. First they dipped the cotton in a
      sodium fluoride solution for an hour, took the wet material and
      dried it in a preheated oven for three hours. Then they heated it
      in a hotter furnace for an hour.<br>
      <br>
      By the time it was done, the cotton had changed into activated
      carbon. Despite being baked, the charred-looking material could
      still be folded. From there, the engineers coated it with a
      nano-layer of the conductive metal manganese oxide for the last
      stage of building their energy storage device. The device, called
      a super capacitor, is able to respond more quickly than a battery
      to power needs.<br>
      <br>
      Lead researcher Xiaodong Li said his team knew that future body
      armor would need a flexible power source. And because the
      scientists work in South Carolina, which used to have a big cotton
      industry, they thought, 'Why not use a cotton T-shirt as the
      energy device?'?<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Li on his A-Ha! Moment</span><br>
      <br>
      Although others have used cotton in devices, Li said that to the
      best of his knowledge his research group is the first to activate
      a cotton T-shirt and build it into a super capacitor. Their
      device's performance is on par with other carbon-based super
      capacitors, according to their testing. After 1,000 cycles it had
      97.3 percent retention.<br>
      <br>
      "This is a very simple low-cost process, and it's green," Li said.
      In addition to starting with a renewable plant-based material, he
      and his research group estimate that using cotton directly from
      textile mills could be as much as 10 times cheaper than chemically
      processing coal or petroleum into activated carbon.<br>
      <br>
      To take his concept to market, the process needs to be scaled up.
      Li said that for this next phase, he's looking for a potential
      industry partner. He's also reaching out to state government
      leaders about using this process to help revive local textile
      production.<br>

      A simple chemical activation route is developed to convert
      insulating cotton T-shirt textiles into highly conductive and
      flexible activated carbon textiles (ACTs) for energy-storage
      applications. Such conversion gives these ACTs an ideal electrical
      double-layer capacitive behavior. The constructed asymmetric
      supercapacitors based on the ACTs and MnO2/ACT composite show
      superior electrochemical performances.<br>

      for forming hybrid nanowires are provided via forming a plurality

      the surface of the carbon microfiber. Hybrid structures are also
      provided, which can include a flexible microwire defining a

      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] To meet urgent needs for sustainable and renewable power
      sources in modern electronic industry, many efforts have been made
      in developing flexible, lightweight and environmentally friendly
      energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and batteries.
      Supereapacitors, also called ultracapacitors, electrochemical
      capacitors (ECs), or electrical double layer capacitors (EDLCs),
      have become some of the most promising candidates for
      next-generation power devices because of their high power density,
      fast charging/discharging rate, sustainable cycling life (millions
      of cycles), and excellent cycle stability. Carboneous materials,
      such as carbon nanotube networks, graphene nanosheets, conducting
      polymers, transition-metal oxides, and hybrid composites have been
      used to fabricate flexible supercapacitor electrodes. Among these
      candidated electrode materials, MnO2 exhibits many intriguing
      characteristics, such as low cost, environmental friendness, and
      natural abundance, suggesting it as the most promising electrode
      material for next generation supercapacitors.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The theoretical specific capacitance of MnO2 is 1370 F/g.
      However, due to its poor electric conductivity
      (10&lt;-5&gt;-10&lt;-6 &gt;S/cm) such high theorectical
      capacitance has not been achieved in experiments. Some high
      performance results have been reported only from nanometer-thick
      MnO2 thin films and/or nanosized MnO2 particles. In addition, when
      the loading of MnO2 is in a high weight percentage in the
      electrode, the MnO2 is densely packed and thus has only very
      limited accessible surface area for participating electrochemical
      charge storage process, which remarkabley increases the contact
      resistance and in turn decreases the specific capacitance.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] One promising approach to realizing the practical
      application of MnO2 and improving its electrical conductivity is
      to incorporate MnO2 nanostructures or nanometer-thick thin films
      into carbon-based materials, such as carbon nanotube networks,
      graphene sheets, and conductive polymers. Recently, Km et at.
      demonstrated an improved electrochemical capacitive behavior by
      coating MnO2 onto SnO2 nanowires grown on stainless steel
      substrate, neverthless, the inflexible/rigid nature of stainless
      steel substrate prevents them from practical applications in harsh
      environments such as folding/twisting conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Therfore, a need exists for methods and materials that can
      maximize utilization of the pseudocapacity of MnO2, while keeping
      its thin film morphology and providing reliable electrical
      connection when designing high performance electrodes for
      MnO2-based electrochemical supercapacitors.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] Objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth
      in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the
      description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Methods are generally provided for forming hybrid
      nanowires. For example, a plurality of conductive nanowires can be
      formed to extend radially from a surface of a flexible microwire
      (e.g., a carbon microwire). The conductive nanowires can generally
      include a metal oxide (e.g., Zn2SnO4, ZnO, SnO2, In2O3, indium tin
      oxide, or combinations thereof). Then, a thin film shell layer can
      be formed around the conductive nanowires. The thin film shell
      layer can generally include a transition metal oxide (e.g., MnO2).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In certain embodiments, prior to forming the plurality of
      conductive nanowires extending radially from the surface of the
      flexible substrate, a catalyst coating layer can be formed on the
      surface of the carbon microfiber. For example, the catalyst
      coating layer can include gold.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Forming the thin film shell layer around the conductive
      nanowires can be achieved, in one embodiment, via forming a
      precusor solution comprising Na2SO4 and KMnO4; and then immersing
      the conductive nanowires into the precursor solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Hybrid structures are also generally provided. For example,
      the hybrid structure can include a flexible microwire (e.g., a
      carbon microwire) defining a surface; a plurality of conductive
      nanowires extending radially from the surface of the flexible
      microfiber; and a thin film shell layer surrounding each
      conductive nanowire. As with the methods discussed above, the
      conductive nanowires can include a metal oxide (e.g., Zn2SnO4,
      ZnO, SnO2, In2O3, indium tin oxide, or combinations thereof), and
      the thin film shell layer can include a transition metal oxide
      (e.g., MnO2). In one particular embodiment, a catalyst coating
      layer (e.g., gold) can be present on the surface of the carbon
      microfiber.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Other features and aspects of the present invention are
      discussed in greater detail below.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0020] The following description and other modifications and
      variations to the present invention may be practiced by those of
      ordinary skill in the art, without departing from the spirit and
      scope of the present invention. In addition, it should be
      understood that aspects of the various embodiments may be
      interchanged both in whole or in part. Furthermore, those of
      ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the following
      description is by way of example only, and is not intended to
      limit the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In the present disclosure, when a layer is being described
      as "on" or "over" another layer or substrate, it is to be
      understood that the layers can either be directly contacting each
      other or have another layer or feature between the layers, unless
      expressly stated to the contrary. Thus, these terms are simply
      describing the relative position of the layers to each other and
      do not necessarily mean "on top of since the relative position
      above or below depends upon the orientation of the viewer.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Chemical elements are discussed in the present disclosure
      using their common chemical abbreviation, such as commonly found
      on a periodic table of elements. For example, hydrogen is
      represented by its common chemical abbreviation H; helium is
      represented by its common chemical abbreviation He; and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] As used herein, the prefix "nano" refers to the nanometer
      scale (e.g., from about 1 um to about 999 nm). For example, wires
      having an average diameter on the nanometer scale (e.g., from
      about 1 nm to about 999 nm) are referred to as "nanowires". On the
      other hand, wires having an average diameter of greater than 1,000
      nm (i.e., 1 [mu]m) are generally referred to as "microwires",
      since the micrometer scale generally involves those materials
      having an average size of greater than 1 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Methods are generally provided for the design and
      fabrication of a hybrid nano/micro-architecture by facile coating
      ultra-thin (several nanometers thick) MnO2 films to highly
      electrical conductive metal oxide (e.g., ZTO) nanowires grown
      radially on flexible microfibers (e.g., carbon microfibers) to
      achieve high specific capacitance, high energy density, high power
      density, and long-term life for supercapacitor electrode
      applications. Such hybrid composites with hierarchical
      architecture are very promising for next generation high
      performance flexible supercapacitors.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Referring to FIG. 5, an exemplary schematic is generally
      shown of a flexible microfiber 12 having a plurality of conductive
      nanowires 14 grown radially from its surface 13. As shown, each of
      the conductive nanowires 14 generally extends in a direction away
      from the surface 13 of the flexible microfiber 12 to define an
      individual conductive nanowire. In one particular embodiment, each
      conductive nanowire 14 can include a metal oxide, such as a zinc
      tin oxide ("ZTO"). Additionally, the surface 13 of the flexible
      microfibers 12 can have a catalyst coating layer (e.g., gold) that
      can serve as a catalyst seed for the formation of the conductive
      nanowires 14 extending from the flexible microfibers 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] FIG. 6 shows an exemplary schematic of a hybrid structure
      10 having a plurality of conductive nanowires 14 grown radially on
      the surface 13 of the carbon microfiber 12, as in FIG. 5, where a
      shell thin film layer 16 has been formed around each conductive
      nanowire 14. In one particular embodiment, the shell thin film
      layer 16 generally includes a transition metal oxide, such as
      MnO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In one particular embodiment, the crystalline ZTO nanowires
      grown radially on CMFs can serve as highly conductive cores to
      support the redox ative MnO2 shells wth highly electrolytic
      accessible surface areas and to provide reliable electrical
      connections to the MnO2 shells.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Each of the flexible microfibers 12, the conductive
      nanowires 14, and the thin film shell layer 16 are discussed in
      greater detail below.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0029] I. Flexible Microfibers</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0030] Any suitable flexible microfiber can serve as the flexible
      substrates for synthesizing metal oxide conductive nanowires,
      particularly with assistance of catalyst coating layer present on
      its surface. In one particular embodiment, the flexible microfiber
      can generally be a carbon microfiber, such as those generally
      composed mostly of carbon atoms, with hydrogen and nitrogen atoms
      sometimes present. The carbon atoms are generally bonded together
      in crystals that are aligned substantially parallel to the long
      axis of the microfiber. In one particular embodiment, each carbon
      microfiber diameter of about 5 micrometers ([mu]m) to about 20
      [mu]m, such as about 5 [mu]m to about 8 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Such carbon microfibers can be produced from a precursor
      polymer. For example, the precursor polymer can be rayon,
      polyacrylonitrile (PAN), petroleum pitch, etc. Typicallly, for
      synthetic polymers such as rayon or PAN, the precursor is first
      spun into filaments, using chemical and mechanical processes to
      initially align the polymer atoms in a way to enhance the final
      physical properties of the completed carbon fiber. Precursor
      compositions and mechanical processes used during spinning may
      vary among manufacturers. After drawing or spinning, the polymer
      fibers can then be heated to drive off non-carbon atoms
      (carbonization), producing the final carbon fiber. The atomic
      structure of carbon microfiber is generally similar to that of
      graphite, with sheets of carbon atoms (graphene sheets) arranged
      in a regular hexagonal pattern.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The crystal alignment gives the microfiber high
      strength-to-volume ratio (e.g., it is strong for its size). The
      properties of such carbon microfibers, such as high flexibility,
      high tensile strength, low weight, high resistance, high
      temperature tolerance and low thermal expansion, make them very
      popular in aerospace, civil engineering, military, and
      motorsports, along with other competition sports. Such carbon
      microfibers are well known in the art and are readily available
      commercially.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Other suitable flexible microfibers may also be used. For
      example, the flexible microfiber can be a metal microfiber having
      a sufficient degree of flex, and defining a thin film catalyst
      coating layer on its surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As stated, the surface of the flexible microfiber may
      define a catalyst coating layer formed thereon. The catalyst
      coating layer can serve as a catalyst and seed for the formation
      of the conductive nanowires to be grown radially thereon. Suitable
      materials that can be present in the catalyst coating layer can
      include Au, Fe, Ni, Ag, Co, or combinations thereof. In one
      embodiment, the catalyst coating layer can include gold (Au). For
      example, the catalyst coating layer can, in one particular
      embodiment, consist essentially of gold (i.e., substantially free
      from other metals).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The catalyst coating layer can be present on the surface of
      the flexible microfibers to an average thickness of about 5 nm to
      about 100 nm on the surface of the flexible microwire. This
      catalyst coating layer can be fabricated via any technique, such
      as those discussed below with respect to the metal oxide
      conductive layer.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0036] II. Conductive Nanowires</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0037] According to the present invention, a plurality of
      conductive nanowires can be formed (e.g., grown) radially around
      the flexible microwire. The conductive nanowires are generally
      composed of at least one metal oxide. In certain embodiments, for
      example, the metal oxide included in the conductive nanowires can
      generally be Zn2SnO4 (ZTO), ZnO, SnO2, In2O3, indium tin oxide
      (ITO), or combinations thereof. In one particular embodiment, the
      metal oxide can include Zn2SnO4. For instance, the conductive
      nanowires can consist essentially of ZTO (e.g., consist of ZTO).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The conductive nanowires can be formed according to any
      suitable method, such as a vapor transport method, physical
      deposition methods (e.g., sputtering), chemical vapor deposition
      methods, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In one embodiment, for example, a vapor transport method
      can be used to form the conductive nanowires around the carbon
      microwire. In such a method, for instance, Zn and SnO powders can
      be mixed, ground, and loaded into a furnace. The microfiber (e.g.,
      coated with a metal thin film, such as gold) loaded into the
      furnace. The furnace can then be heated (e.g., to a deposition
      temperature of about 800[deg.] C. to about 1000[deg.] C., such as
      about 850[deg.] C. to about 950[deg.] C.). For example, the
      furnace can be heated at a rate of about 3[deg.] C./min to about
      10[deg.] C./min. Then, once at the deposition temperature, the
      furnace can be held constant for at least 30 minutes to synthesize
      the ZTO nanowires. During deposition, an inert gas (e.g., Ar gas)
      can be introduced into the furnace (e.g., at a flow rate of about
      50 sccm), and the deposition pressure can be kept relatively low
      (e.g., less than about 10 Torr, such as about 1 Torr to about 8
      Ton).<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The conductive nanowires can, in certain embodiments, have
      an average diameter of about 10 nm to about 100 nm, such as about
      15 nm to about 50 nm. Additionally, the conductive nanowires can,
      in certain embodiments, extend for a length of about 1 [mu]m to
      about 20 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0041] III. Thin Film Shell Layer</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0042] A thin film shell layer can be formed over (e.g.,
      surrounding) the conductive nanowires. The thin film shell layer
      generally includes at least one transition metal oxide, but may
      also include other materials. In certain embodiments, for example,
      the transition metal oxide included in the thin film shell layer
      can generally be MnO2, V6O13, V2O5, WO3, MoO3, RuO2, Fe3O4, or
      combinations thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one particular embodiment, the transition metal oxide
      can include MnO2. For example, the thin film shell layer can
      include MnO2 in at least about 90% by weight of the thin film
      shell layer, such as about 95% by weight to 100% by weight. For
      example, the thin film shell layer can, in certain embodiments,
      consist essentially of MnO2 such that the thin film shell layer
      generally is substantially free from other materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The thin film shell layer can be formed on the conductive
      nanowires according to any suitable method, such as a spontaneous
      redox deposition, physical deposition methods (e.g., sputtering),
      chemical vapor deposition methods, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In one embodiment, for example, a spontaneous redox
      deposition method can be used to form the thin film shell layer
      around the conductive nanowires. For example, in such a method, a
      precursor solution for the coating process can be prepared by
      mixing Na2SO4 and KMnO4 solutions. Conductive nanowires, together
      with their supporting flexible microwires, can then be immersed
      into the precursor solution for a sufficient time to allow the
      thin film shell layer comprising MnO2 to be formed thereon. The
      thickness of the thin film shell layer can be controlled by
      adjusting the immersion time, which can typically be about 30
      minutes to about 120 minutes (e.g., about 60 minutes). After
      immersing, the resulting coated microfiber can be rinsed with
      deionized water and then heat treated (e.g., at 120[deg.] C. for
      12 h) in air.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] As such, in most embodiments, the thin film shell layer can
      cover substantially all of the surface area of the conductive
      nanowires. For example, the thin film shell layer can cover at
      least about 95% of the surface area of the conductive nanowires,
      such as about 97% to 100% of the surface area of the conductive
      nanowires.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLES</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0047] The design and fabrication of a hybrid
      nano/micro-architecture was demonstrated by facile coating
      ultra-thin (several nanometers thick) MnO2 films to highly
      electrical conductive Zn2SnO4 (ZTO) nanowires (conductivity:
      10&lt;2&gt;-10&lt;3 &gt;S/cm) grown radially on flexible carbon
      microfibers (CMFs) to achieve high specific capacitance, high
      energy density, high power density, and long-term life for
      supercapacitor electrode applications. The maximum specific
      capacitances of 621.6 F/g (based on pristine MnO2) by cyclic
      voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s and 642.4 F/g by
      chronopotenitiometry at a current density of 1 A/g were achieved
      in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite
      also exhibited excellent rate capability with a specific energy of
      36.8 Wh/kg and a specific power of 32 kW/kg at the current density
      of 40 A/g, respectively, and outstanding long-term cycling
      stability (only 1.2% loss of its initial specific capacitance
      after 1000 cycles). These results suggest that such MnO2/ZTO/CMF
      hybrid composite with hierarchical architecture is very promising
      for next generation high performance flexible supercapacitors.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The crystalline ZTO nanowires grown radially on CMFs served
      uniquely as highly electrical conductive cores to support the
      redox active MnO2 shells with highly electrolytic accessible
      surface areas and to provide reliable electrical connections to
      the MnO2 shells, enabling full utilization of MnO2 and realizing
      fast electric and ionic conduction through the electrode. The
      maximum specific capacitance of 621.6 F/g (based on pristine MnO2)
      by cyclic votalmmetry (CV) at a scan rate of 2 mV/s and 642.4 F/g
      by chronopotenitiometry at a current density of 1 A/g were
      achieved in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid
      composite also exhibited excellent rate capability with a specific
      energy of 36.8 Wh/kg and a specific power of 32 kW/kg at the
      current density of 40 A/g, and outstanding long-term cycling
      stability (only 1.2% loss of its initial specific capacitance
      after 1000 cycles), which were derived from galvanostatic (GV)
      charge-discharge measurements. These results suggest that such
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite with hierarchical architecture is
      very promising for next generation high performance flexible
      supercapacitors,<br>
      <br>
      [0049] High density ZTO nanowires were fabricated on commercial
      woven CMFs with a diameter of several micrometers by a simple
      vapor transport method in a horizontal tube furnace (for details,
      see Supporting Information). To faciliate the eletrochemical
      tests, one bundle of ZTO nanowire/CMF were taken out from the
      woven structures and then immersed into a mixed solution
      containing 0.1 M Na2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 M KMnO4
      (Sigma-Aldrich). In addition, to enhance the mechanical stability
      and electrical conductivity of the electrode, after coating MnO2,
      the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite was heat treated at 120[deg.] C.
      for 12 h in air (for details, see Supporting Information). FIG.
      1(a-d) shows the morphology and microstructure of ZTO nanowires on
      the woven CMFs. It is revealed that high density of ZTO nanowires
      were radially grown on the CMFs. These ZTO nanowires have lengths
      of tens of micrometers and diameters of around 80 nm. To
      investigate the microstructure of ZTO/MnO2 core/shell nanocables,
      TEM imaging and selected-area electron diffraciton (SAED) analysis
      were employed. A typical TEM image of an individual nanocable is
      shown in FIG. 1e. The SAED pattern (FIG. 1f) can be indexed as
      single crystalline inverse spinel structure of Zn2SnO4 with [110]
      as zone axis (JCPDS No. 24-1470, Fd 3m, a=b=c=0.865 nm). No MnO2
      related diffraction pattern or spot can be found, indicating that
      the coated MnO2 is amorphous. A rough and amorphous MnO2 shell
      with a thickness of several nanometers was found on the ZTO
      nanowire surface, as shown in FIGS. 2g and 2h. The elemental
      spatial distributions across the ZTO/MnO2 core-shell nanocale were
      characterized by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) in the form
      of line scan profiles of individual elements Zn, Sn, O and Mn, as
      shown in FIG. 2j. The peaks of the Zn and Sn line-scan profiles
      are located in the center of the profile of Mn, confirming the
      core-shell configuration of the ZTO/MnO2 nanocable. The oxidation
      state of Mn atoms in the as-coated MnO2 shells on ZTO nanowire
      cores was determined as ~4.0 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
      (XPS) (for details, see Supporting Information). The amorphous
      nature of the MnO2 coating is more favorable for supercapacitor
      applications compared with the previously reported crystalline
      MnO2 coatings.&lt;42 &gt;This core-shell ZTO/MnO2 architecture has
      a potential to improve the electrochemical performance of the
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite. The thin layer of MnO2 enables the
      fast and reversible faradic reaction by shortening the ion
      diffusion path and such a low weight loading of MnO2 can achieve
      high specific capacitance. Furthermore, the high specific areas of
      core ZTO nanowires provides highly conductive channels to
      effectively transport electrolyte. By using this nano/micro
      hierarchical design, we can fully utilize the outstanding
      electrochemical performance of MnO2 to realize both high energy
      densty and high power density characteristics for real
      electrochemical capacitor applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 2a shows the cyclic votalmmetry (CV) curves of the
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite electrode at scan rates of 2, 5, 10,
      20, 50, 100 mV/s with potential windows ranging from 0 to 0.8V vs
      Ag/AgCl in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The shapes of these curves
      are quasi-rectangular, indicating the ideal electrical
      double-layer capacitance behavior and fast charging/discharging
      process characteristic. The MnO2 coated ZTO nanowires involved
      redox reactions in the cyclic voltammetry tests as the Mn atoms in
      the overlayer were converted into higher/lower valence states,
      which were induced by intercalation/extration of protons
      (H3O&lt;+&gt;) or alkili cations (Na&lt;+&gt;) into/out of the
      ZTO/MnO2 core/shell nanocables and could be expressed as:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      MnO2+M&lt;+&gt;+e&lt;-&gt;MnOOM, M&lt;+&gt;=Na&lt;+&gt; or
      H3O&lt;+&gt; (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0051] To demonstrate the electrochemical performance benefits of
      the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite, cyclic votalmmetry (CV) tests
      were performed on the respective MnO2/CMF and ZTO/CMF composites,
      as shown in FIGS. 2b and 2c. For the MnO2/CMF composite (FIG. 2b),
      the CV curves obtained at different scan rates also show
      quasi-rectangular shapes, however, the separation between leveled
      anodic and cathodic currents are much smaller than the
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF composite at the same scan rates, indicating smaller
      specific capacitances for the MnO2/CMF and ZTO/CMF composites. For
      the ZTO/CMF composite (FIG. 2c), the CV curves do not show the
      normal regular shape and the leveled current separation between
      leveled anodic and cathodic currents are much smaller, suggesting
      the poor electrochemical performance of the ZTO/CMF composite. The
      specific capacitances calculated from the CV curves (for details,
      see Supporting Information) with different scan rates are shown in
      FIG. 2d. At the scan rate of 2 mV/s, the specific capacitance of
      the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite can achieve 621.6 F/g (based on
      the mass of pristine MnO2), while those of the MnO2/CMF and
      ZTO/CMF composites are only 46.6 and 5.6 F/g, respectively. The CV
      tests performed on the CMF electrode indicated that only 0.15 F/g
      of specific capacitance can be obtained at the scan rate of 2 mV/s
      (for details, see Supporting Information). Therefore, in the
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite, the capacitance contributed from
      ZTO nanowires and CMFs are negligible. The CV tests suggest that
      compared with the MnO2/CMF composite, through growth of ZTO
      nanowires on CMFs as template to coat MnO2, the electrochemical
      accessible surface area is remarkably increased due to the large
      surface to volume ratio of the ZTO nanowires, resulting in the
      significant improvement of the specific capacitance. Additionally,
      the high specific capacitance value confirms that such design and
      fabrication of the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite allows maximizing
      the utilization of the electrochemical performance of MnO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Rate capabilitiy is one of the important factors for
      evaluating the power applications of supercapacitors. The
      constant-current galvanostatic (GV) charge/discharge curves of the
      as-prepared MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite at different current
      densities are shown in FIG. 3a. The charging/discharging cycling
      curves have a vey symmetric nature, indicating again that the
      composite has a good electrochemical capacitive characteristic and
      superior reversible redox reaction. This symmetric nature of the
      charing/discharging cycling curves can be maintained even at a low
      density of 1 A/g, as shown in FIG. 3 a. The specfic capacitances
      derived from the discharging curves (for details, see Supporting
      information) at different charge/discharge rates (current
      densities) are shown in FIG. 3b. The specfic capacitance of the
      composite at the current density of 1 A/g was calculated to be
      642.3 F/g based on the mass of the pristine MnO2, which is
      comparable with the results of the CV tests. Although the specific
      capacitance is lower than the previously reported 800 F/g, our
      prepared MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite electrode is highly
      flexible and lightweight and can be applied even in harsh
      environments such as folding/twisting conditions. To study the
      flexibility of the composite electrodes, we investigated the
      electrochemical performance of the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite
      electrodes under folding/twisting conditions, no apparent changes
      were observed in the electrochemical tests. This confirms the
      highly flexible nature of the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite
      electrodes for supercapacitors. At a very high current density of
      40 A/g, the specific capacitance remained at 413.9 F/g. Such
      superior rate capability in the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite can
      be attributed to the reduced short diffusion path of ions, highly
      accessible surface area and increased electrical conductivity by
      utilizing ZTO nanowires radially grown on CMFs as supporting
      backbones to coat MnO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Specific energy and specific power are the two key factors
      for evaluating the power applications of electrochemical
      supercapacitors. A good electrochemical supercapacitor is expected
      to provide both high energy density and high specific capacitance
      at high charging-discharging rates (current densities). FIG. 3c
      shows the Ragone plot for the MnO2/ZTO/CMF composite electrode at
      the potential window of 0.8 V in 1 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution. The
      specific energy decreases from 57.1 to 36.8 Wh/kg, while the
      specific power increases from 0.8 to 32 kW/kg as the galvanostatic
      (GV) charge/discharge current increased from 1 to 40 A/g. These
      values are much higher than those of conventional supercapacitors
      in Ragone plot. Most importantly, the highest specific power
      value, 32 kW/kg, can meet the power demands of the PNGV
      (Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles), demonsrating the
      feasiblity of the as-prepared MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite
      electrode for electrochemical supercapacitors as power supply
      components in hybrid vehicle systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Another important requirement for supercapacitor
      applications is cycling capability or cycling life. The cycling
      life tests over 1000 cycles for the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite
      at a current density of 10 A/g were carried out using
      constant-current galvanostatic (GV) charge/discharge cycling
      techniques in the potential windows ranging from 0 to 0.8 V. FIG.
      3d shows the specific capacitance retention of the MnO2/ZTO/CMF
      hybrid composite as a function of charge/discharge cycling
      numbers. The composite electrode showed only 1.2% loss in the
      specific capacitance after 1000 charge-discharge cycles and the
      last 10 cycles remained almost the same shape of charge-discharge
      curves with the first 10 cycles (insets in FIG. 3d), illustrating
      the excellent long term cyclability of the composite electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The enhanced electrochemical performance of the hybrid
      composite electrode with using ZTO nanowires radially grown on
      CMFs as the template to coat MnO2 shells was further confirmd by
      the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in
      the same setup as the CV and GV tests. FIG. 4a shows the Nyquist
      plots of the EIS spectra of ZTO/CMF (blue triangles), MnO2/CMF
      (red circles) and MnO2/ZTO/CMF (black squares) composites,
      respectively. The EIS data can be fitted by a equivalent circuit
      consisting of a bulk solution resistance R5, a charge-transfer
      Rct, a pseudo-capacitive element Cp from redox process of MnO2,
      and a constant phase element (CPE) to account for the doule-layer
      capacitance, as shown in FIG. 4b. The bulk solution resistance Rs
      and charge-transfer resistance Rct can be obtained from the
      Nyquist plots, where the high frequency semicircle intercepts the
      real axis at Rs and (Rs+Rct), respectively. The solution
      resistance Rs of these three composites was measured to be 8.7,
      5.5 and 10.6[Omega], respectively, while the charge-transfer
      resistance Rct was calculated to be 1.6, 13.4 and 4.9[Omega],
      respectively. This clearly demonstrates the reduced
      charge-transfer resistance of the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite
      electrode by using ZTO nanowires radially grown on CMFs as the
      template to coat MnO2 thin layers compared with that of using CMFs
      alone to coat MnO2 directly. In addition, the charge-transfer
      resistance Rct, also called Faraday resitance, is a limiting
      factor for the specific power of the supercapacitor. It is the low
      Faraday resistance that results in the high specific power of the
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In summary, a simple and cost-effective mothodology is
      developed to fabricate flexible supercapacitors based on
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite electrodes. In such a composite, the
      thin amorphous MnO2 layer enables fast reversible redox reaction
      to improve the specific capacitance, while the ZTO nanowires grown
      radially on CMFs provide highly conductive supporting backbones
      for coating amorphous MnO2 to effectively transporting
      electrolytes and shortening the ion diffusion path. These
      characteristics offer the excellent electrochemical performance of
      the MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composites, such as high specific
      capacitance, good charge-discharge stability, excellent rate
      capability, long-term cycling life, high specific energy and high
      specfic power. These results suggest that such MnO2/ZTO/CMF
      composite with hierarchical architecture is very promising for
      next generation high performance flexible supercapacitors.<br>

        Fabrication and Characterization of Zn2SnO4 Nanowires on Carbon
        Microfibers</span><br>
      <br>
      [0057] Commercially available woven carbon microfibers (CMFs,
      Fibre Glast Development Corporation) were used directly as
      templated substrate without further processing to synthesize
      Zn2SnO4 (ZTO) nanowires. The ZTO nanowires were synthesized via a
      simple vapor transport method in a horizontal alumina tube furnace
      (id: 73 mm, length: 1000 mm, GSL-1700-60X, MTI Corp.). Zn and SnO
      powders (weight ratio 1:2, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) were
      mixed, ground, and then loaded into an alumina boat, which was
      then placed in the center of the alumina tube mounted on the
      furnace. The CMFs sputter-coated with Au film were placed at 5 cm
      downstream from the alumina boat. The tube furnace was sealed and
      heated to 900[deg.] C. at a rate of 5[deg.] C./min, and then held
      for 1 h to synthesize ZTO nanowires. During the experiment, high
      purity Ar gas (99.99%) was introduced into the tube at a flow rate
      of 50 seem and the pressure of the tube was evacuated to a
      pressure of 5 Torr. After the furnace was cooled down to the room
      temperature, the resulting product was collected for
      characterization by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss Ultra
      Plus FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku DMax 2200 using Cu
      K[alpha] radiation, [lambda]=1.5418 A), X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy (XPS, Kratos Axis Ultra DLD equipped with a
      monochromated Al K[alpha]X-ray source and hemispherical analyzer

      microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H8000) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM,
      JEOL 2010F equipped with an EDX detector from Oxford Instruments).
      To investigate the improvement of the electrochemical performance
      by using CMFs as substrate, a control sample with ZTO nanowires
      grown on stainless steel (SS) substrate was similarly fabricated
      by replacing the CMFs with SS substrate while keeping other
      experimental conditions the same.<br>

        Coating MnO2 onto ZTO Nanowires Grown on CMFs</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0058] Previous studies have shown that spontaneous redox
      deposition of MnO2 on carbon materials is pH-dependent. In acid
      solutions, reduction of permanganate ion (MnO4) to MnO2 can result
      in large agglomerated particles of MnO2. While in neutral
      solutions, thin films of MnO2 can be obtained on the surface of
      carbon. In this study, the precursor solution for the coating
      process was prepared by mixing 0.1 M Na2SO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) and
      0.1 M KMnO4 (Sigma-Aldrich) solutions. The CMFs grown with ZTO
      nanowires were immersed into the solution and the typical duration
      time of the immersion was 60 min. The loading amount of MnO2 can
      be easily controlled by adjusting the immersion time. After
      immersing, the sample was rinsed with deionized water and then
      heat treated at 120[deg.] C. for 12 h in air. In addition, the
      control samples of MnO2/CMF and MnO2/ZTO/SS composites were
      fabricated similarly by coating MnO2 onto commercial CMFs and ZTO
      nanowires on SS substrate, respectively.<br>

      <br>
      [0060] X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite were used to determine the oxidation
      state of as-coated MnO2 shells on ZTO nanowire cores. Mn 2p
      spectrum showed that the binding energy peaks of Mn 2p3/2 and Mn
      2p1/2 are centered at 642.2 eV and 654.1 eV, respectively, which
      is in good agreement with the previously reported peak binding
      energy separation (11.8 eV) between Mn 23/2 and Mn 2p1/2. As
      reported previously, the average oxidation state of Mn in
      manganese oxides can be determined by the separation of peak
      energies ([Delta]E) of the Mn 3s peaks caused by multiplet
      splitting, where the [Delta]E data of MnO, Mn3O4, Mn2O3 and MnO2
      are 5.79, 5.50, 5.41 and 4.78 eV, respectively. The as-prepared
      MnO2/ZTO/CMF hybrid composite electrode showed a separated energy
      of 4.7 eV for the Mn 3s doublet, which suggests that the oxidation

      The specific capacitances between the MnO2/ZTO/Stainless Steel
