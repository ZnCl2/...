          piezo-electrically vibrates a mix of waters through a special
          dielectric material to produce heat energy in more abundance
          than the energy which powers the oscillator. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The device is reported to put out
          40 kilowatts of heat energy with only two kilowatts of
          electrical input. Last year Dr. Josef Gruber described a visit
          to the research institute where Koldomasov is managing
          engineer. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Koldomasov discovered the new
          energy source while observing cavitation-implosions in water
          such as found in "water hammer" in pipes. Gruber showed a
          photograph of the small device, filled with pure water mixed
          with only one per cent deuterium (heavy water). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Although there are no spark plugs
          or similar equipment, electrical discharge could be seen.
          Energy comes out in the form of both heat and electrical
          current. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Depending on kind and location of
          the magnets, DC or AC (electricity) may be observed. Gruber
          said testing revealed 2000 per cent excess energy. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">One of the most important
          achievements of the 19th century physics was the discovery
          that a well defined amount of mechanical work is needed to
          generate one unit of heat -- not less and not more. Joule
          demonstrated this in a well known paddle wheel experiment.
          Water was forced to flow through small holes in the paddles of
          a rotating wheel and the amount of heat was measured
          calorimetrically. But, at a recent conference, a Russian
          scientist, A.I. Koldamasov (1), described an exception from
          this rule. He claims to have a device in which the heat to
          work ratio is twenty times larger than what would be allowed
          according to Joule’s equivalence rule. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">His device, named reactor, is
          similar to Joule’s paddle wheel. But water, free of ions
          (resistivity 1011 ohm/m), is forced to flow through holes
          (diameters 1-2 mm) drilled in a plate made from the dielectric
          material (rather than from a metal). After reviewing basic
          concepts of thermonuclear physics Koldamasov writes: “On the
          basis of the above theoretical ideas, a nuclear reactor
          producing energy of nuclear fusion reactions was designed and
          tested (see Fig. 1). The reactor operation is stable and well
          controllable. It gives 20 units of useful power per unit of
          supplied power. Furthermore, it is possible to obtain power
          both in the form of heat and directly electric energy,
          omitting steam water cycle. According to the consumer’s needs,
          the electric energy can be of both direct and alternating
          current. [Russian patent reference is given.] . . . </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The working fluid is fed by a gear
          pump under the pressure of 5 to 7 MPa; the channel is 25-30 cm
          long, and the orifice diameter is 1-2 mm. By changing the
          electric motor rotation rate, we change the frequency of flow
          pulsation's and reach the resonance frequency of the orifice,
          which causes intensive cavitation. Under the action of this
          cavitation, the plate material emits electrons from the input
          edge, which are carried away by the flow, and at the output
          edge a high-density positive charge is formed (see Fig. 6).
          The charge is annular, its density is practically uniform, and
          it constitutes a medium temperature plasma ~10000 K with the
          density ~104 J/cm3. If heavy water possessing the same
          dielectric properties as the working fluid is added to the
          outflowing medium, then nuclear fusion reactions arise in the
          zone of influence of the charge.” </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">What kind instruments were used to
          demonstrate occurrence of nuclear reactions? I was not able to
          find the answer to this question in the Koldamasov’s paper.
          Here is how this paper ends: “The number of deuterium atoms
          collisions, and hence the magnitude of the released energy,
          depends on heavy water concentration in the working fluid. In
          our experiments we used a mixture with the ratio 1:100 (1 part
          of heavy water per 100 parts of light water). The continuous
          operation time was up to 100 hours. The experiments are
          entirely reproducible.” Who is Koldamasov? Where were his
          experiments performed? Who are his coworkers? How much of
          “excess energy” was generated in 100 hours? Not knowing how to
          answer such questions I turned to the Internet. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The first item that came up, after
          typing “Koldamasov” indicates that reproducible results were
          first reported by the author seven years ago. Here is the
          extract from what was delivered by Google: “Six authors who
          stated 100% reproducibility of the effects detected are
          Bazhutov, Kanarev, Karabut, Savvatimova, Notoya, and
          Koldamasov.” <br>
          And here is another earlier reference (2). On Hideo Kozima's
          website: </p>

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I see a list of papers read at the
          9th Russian Conference on Cold Nuclear Transmutation of
          Chemical Elements (September/October, 2001). It contains
          references (3) and (4). The session at which these papers were
          presented was chaired by A. B. Karabut, the author of what I
          described in item 13. The device is said to generate twenty
          times more electric energy that is needed to run its motor.
          Why is it not manufactured and used all over? I suspect that
          the 100% reproducibility claim was found to be highly
          exaggerated. Somebody probably tried and failed to produce a
          commercially successful gadget. </p>

          NewsWire), I sent an e-mail message to Dr. Yang, the Chairman

        <p style="text-align: left;">Browsing the Internet (before going
          to the MIT cold fusion colloquium next Friday) I found this
          description of your commercial activities: </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">". . . The three main applications
          derived from "Cold Fusion" are massive production of low cost
          hydrogen and heat energy for commercial and industrial
          applications steam or hot water and electric power. . . ." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Please provide a reference (or
          references) about the method used to obtain electric power via
          cold fusion. Thanks in advance, <br>
          Ludwik Kowalski </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">2) The above message was not
          answered. During the MIT colloquium I heard that Koldamasov
          died and that his invention is going to be used by a company
          whose name is iESiUSA (Innovative Energy Syatems Inc.).
          Materials on the company’s website &lt;WWW.iesiusa.com&gt; do
          not refer to cold fusion. But they are worth quoting. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">a) “Innovative Energy Solution Inc.
          is a leader in developing reliable next generation, clean
          energy technologies. iESi owns several patents related to its
          proprietary hydrogen generation, heat generating and waste
          heat recovery technologies.” </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">b) “The new clean energy plant will
          enable Norwood Foundry to generate six times (12 MW) more
          electricity than it consumes (2 MW) at its foundry located in
          Nisku, Alberta, Canada.” That is indeed extraordinary -
          consuming electric energy at the rate of 2 MW and generating
          it at the rate of 12 MW, presumably at the same time. This
          would be a giant perpetual motion machine. Recall that
          Koldamasov's device had the output/input ratio of twenty, not
          six. But even a factor of two would be extraordinary. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">c) “The revenue to be generated
          through the joint venture project is expected to exceed $6
          million annually. Under the joint venture, iESi is responsible
          for the implementation of its revolutionary clean energy
          technologies, while Norwood [the old existing foundry] will
          finance the project. . . . The plant is slated to be fully
          operational by the third quarter of 2005. . . .iESi owns
          several patents related to its proprietary hydrogen
          generation, heat generating and waste heat recovery
          technologies. Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, iESi also
          has offices in Canada, Europe and South Korea.” I hope that my
          retirement savings are not invested in iESi. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">d) Innovative Energy Solutions Inc.
          (iESi) today announced that it raised $3 million in its first
          round of financing. The investor group consists of more than
          300 individuals from Canada, Europe and the United States.
          iESi will use the investment to accelerate product
          development, push market penetration and establish
          manufacturing facilities in Alabama. ‘The success of our
          initial funding is encouraging to iESi as we focus on
          executing our business endeavors and growing the company. The
          first round closed with an oversubscription of 200,000 shares,
          which demonstrates a substantial interest in our energy
          generating technologies and what they can do for a fuel-based
          economy,; said Ron Foster, chairman, iESi. iESi will open its
          second round of financing on July 29, 2004, by offering
          500,000 shares at $4 apiece. Established in 2003, iESi’s
          mission is to offer clean, viable solutions to traditional
          energy sources, and reduce the world’s dependence on oil from
          the Middle East. iESi is organized into three broad divisions
          to maximize return on its intellectual capital and
          intellectual property.” </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Too good to be true? Yes, I think
          so. But the company website provides many claims that are
          worth discussing with students. Physics teachers should take
          advantage of this. Something is not right in this business of
          promoting nonexistent technologies. In unit #224 I referred to
          a colloquium presentation of Robert Rines, the patent
          counselor at MIT. At one point he asked a question; “what harm
          can possibly result from granting a patent whose validity
          cannot be established at sufficiently high level of
          certainty?” He was referring to patents in the area of cold
          fusion. Nobody, he said, will be stupid enough to invest in
          things that are still uncertain. I now tend to disagree. A
          granted patent gives some kind of legitimacy to unjustified
          commercial claims. Patents can be viewed as instruments of
          protection of citizens. Yes, I know that such instruments are
          not very effective. But they are better than nothing. Citizens
          should also be economically protected by other legal means. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;">1) Please be aware that my unit
          #229 now has two added sections, at the end. They were not
          there when the unit was posted, several days ago. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">2) It seems to me that we really
          need a forum for discussion, among cold fusion researchers.
          Unfortunately, the discussion list of ISCMNS, promised at
          ICCF11, did not materialize. And what happened to the online
          journal promised one year earlier? Let me make Éa suggestion.
          I have an idle discussion list at the university server; it
          can become a forum we need. To be a participant simply send me
          a private message whose subject line should say: “Discussion
          of CF.” The first line (in the body of the message) should
          show your name (first, then last) followed by the e-mail
          address. The next line (or lines) should say why you consider
          yourself to be a cold fusion researcher. Participation in at
          least one of the ICCF* conference, for example, is a
          sufficient reason, as far as I am concerned. My e-mail address
          is &lt;kowalskil@mail.montclair.edu&gt;. The list will be
          activated as soon as the number of participants exceeds 20.
          Please, send this invitation to serious CF researchers you
          know; not everybody will see it here. Cut this paragraph and
          paste it into messages you sent. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">3) Today I received two Russian
          papers from ? one of the readers. They seem to be related to
          the device invented by Koldamasov and Yang. (see units #216,
          #226 and #229). These papers prompted me to start this unit. I
          will try to translate them and make some comments. The copies
          of pages mailed to me do not identify the place of
          publication. But the sender wrote that the papers were
          “published in 2001, following the 2000 Sochi conference.” </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Paper 1: "Studying of thermal and
          radiation effects in Koldamasov’s cell”, by D.S. Baranov. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Paper 2: "An experimental setup
          based on Koldamasov’s cell". by A.P. Andreev, D.S. Baranov,
          A.K. Molodov, A.K. Pokrovski and N.N Sikavatkin. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The authors of these papers are
          from Moscow ( Scientific Institute of Crystallography, Russian
          Academy of Science, and MRTI (?)). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Translation of sections from
            Paper #2 ---</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract:</b> A temperature
          increase of short duration ø was observed in Koldamasov’s cell
          when heavy water was locally added to the working fluid. The
          temperature did not changed when ordinary water was added,
          under analogous conditions. Adding lithium chloride to water
          resulted in registration of radiation in the scintillation
          detector. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This study was undertaken to
          reproduce previously reported results (1,2) and to enlarge the
          scope of a more recent investigation (3). The central element
          of that installation, the Koldamasov cell, was made from the
          transparent organic glass. Bright glowing discharge (plasmoid)
          was observed in front of the opening in the insertion when
          cavitation was taking place. The insertion changes the cross
          section, available to the fluid, by two orders of magnitude.
          Pressures in cell were changed in the range of 10-40
          atmospheres at the frequency of ~1000 Hz. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The working fluid was oil whose
          temperature was ~33 C. At that temperature the viscosity of
          heavy water exceeds the viscosity of ordinary water by ~20%.
          This, however, could not lead to a significant increase of
          friction (resulting from addition of heavy water) because the
          viscosity of oil is ~20 times higher than that of water.
          Sensitive calorimeters were used to measure difference in
          temperatures between the input and output of the cell. The
          electrical diagram is shown in Figure 1. It is essentially a
          Wheatstone bridge in which R1 and R2 are thermistors. Medical
          injectors were used to introduce heavy or ordinary water at
          the entrance of the pump. The injected volume was one cubic
          centimeter and the time of each injection was ~10 seconds. The
          time was sufficiently long to mix the injected water with ~
          1000 cubic centimeters of oil. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In the first experiment heavy water
          was injected first and ordinary water was injected later. In
          the second experiment ordinary water was injected before heavy
          water. Figure 2 shows that difference ?s in temperature
          occurred after injections of heavy water only. [In that figure
          changes in difference of temperatures are expressed in volts
          but the bridge was calibrated]. According to calibrations,
          changes shown in Figure 2 were the same as from the injection
          of one cubic centimeter of water at 100C. Trying to optimize
          generation of excess heat one observed cases in which no
          excess heat was generated and cases when changes in
          temperatures were sufficiently high to melt ftoroploast
          insertions. Destruction of the insertion was observed three
          times, but only when oil was mixed with several cubic
          centimeters of heavy water. Insertions were never destroyed
          when oil contained no heavy water (even at much higher
          temperatures and pressures). </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Radiation emitted by the cell was
          measured by using a 5 cm by 5 cm cylindrical NaI detector. The
          detector was ~8 cm from the insertion. Radiation entering the
          detector had to pass through an aluminum foil of 0.5 mm, 5 cm
          of organ ?ic glass and a 5 mm layer of ftoroplast. [In other
          words it consists of gamma rays.] The setup was calibrated by
          using the annihilation line (511 keV) and a sodium line of
          1460 keV. The multichannel analyzer spectra are shown in
          Figure 3. . . . [The background does not change significantly
          when the motor of the pump is turned on to off. A significant
          above-the-background component appears (in the gamma ray
          energies up to 250 keV) after 0.8 cubic centimeters of the
          water solution of lithium chloride, concentration 4 N, is
          injected into oil. The conclusion is:] Radiation measurements
          and temperature effects due to heavy water are with
          Koldamasov’s findings and show that nuclear processes do take
          place in the cell. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">[I am certain that scientists who
          prepared the last week demonstration in Emonson did not miss
          an opportunity to show, using a widely available detector,
          that gamma rays are indeed emitted from their setup. The setup
          generating excess heat at the ra Ëte of 10 MW must be much
          larger than the setup used by Baranov. When will the results
          of the last week demonstration be announced?] </p>

            Paper #1 ---</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Abstract:</b> A compact
          experimental setup, analogous to that described by Koldamasov
          (1,2), was built. It shows that stable glowing discharge
          (plasmoid) is produced in the liquid under the influence of
          cavitation. [Does this mean that what was called “cavitational
          emission,” in unit #229, stands for sonoluminescence?] </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">According to (1,2) a new approach
          approach is possible to generate thermonuclear energy. An
          independent confirmation of this could lead to a broad
          investigation of that approach. Direct c onfirmation of
          Koldamasov’ work is difficult because the working fluid in his
          device was pure (double distillation) dielectric water. The
          reason is simple; the dielectric properties of pure water
          change drastically after it passes through the cell. Changed
          water must be purified before it can be reused. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In this investigation we tried to
          use a different working fluid -- organic oil. Dielectric
          properties of oil are more favorable but that substance is
          about 20 times more viscous than water. We were able to find
          conditions under which bright glow discharge (plasmoid) is
          formed in oil. The diagram of the setup is shown in Figure 1.
          [I shows a loop in which oil is forced to circulate under
          pulsating pressure. Numerous technical details (pump rpm,
          pressures, frequen Ocies, etc. are provided. A set of three
          dots in the part of the article that I decided not to
          translate. Set of three dots below stand for was not
          translated] . . . The central element of that installation,
          the Koldamasov cell, was made from the transparent organic
          glass. It has a dielectric insertion with a narrow opening
          (cross section being 100 times smaller that in the tube
          through which the oil is supplied to the cell). Stable glowing
          discharge was observed at the entrance of insertions made from
          organic glass, ftoroplast and polysterol. It was observed when
          the insertion was made from vinoplast. Ftoroplast turned out
          to be the most effective when the pressure was ~30 atm.
          Appearance of plasmoid must be due to cavitation. . . .
          Characteristic speed of the fluid through the insertion
          opening (radius 0.5 mm) was 50 m/s. . . . ~ </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The total volume of working fluid
          was ~6 liters. It is remarkable that oil was not spoiled
          during its prolonged (`10 hours) circulation through the loop.
          An attempt to use less fluid liquid, a mixture oil and
          kerosine, also resulted in formation of plasmoid. But the pump
          deteriorated rapidly when that fluid was used. The setup is
          sufficiently compact to be used in practical applications. </p>

        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>ABSTRACT</b> --- This is an
          introduction to the hydraulic-electrostatic cold fusion method
          that was first demonstrated to a small public group on June 6,
          2005, in Edmonton, Canada. Observation of devices that appear
          to be 100 percent repeatable and of practical, commercial
          magnitude was seen. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.1. Introduction</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">This work was demonstrated by a
          group managed by Hyunik Yang, professor ofmechanical
          engineering at Hanyang University, Korea. Other members of
          this research team are Alexandr Koldamasov (ret.) of the
          Russian National Research Institute of Atomic Engineering,
          Andrei Desyatov, deputy director of the Russian Aviation and
          Space Agency at the Keldysh Research Center in Moscow, Alla
          Kornilova, physics professor and director at Moscow State
          University, Vladimir Vysotskii, physics professor at Kiev
          Shevchencko University, and Nahm Cho, professor of mechanical
          engineering at Hanyang University, Korea. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">A second group of Russians is
          associated with this research. They are Evgeny Pavlovich
          Velikhov, president of Kurchatov Research Institute,
          Gerasimovich Gnedenko, director of Kurchatov Research
          Institute, and Vital’evich Goryachev, associate director of
          Kurchatov Research Institute. Gnedenko and Goryachev are the
          assignees of a related Russian patent, No. RU2232210. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.2. Brief Review of Current
            Progress in Cold Fusion</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">At the 16-year mark in cold
          fusion's evolution, progress toward a new source of energy has
          been consistent but slow. The current limitations are clearly
          evident. Weak reactions have been relatively easy to
          reproduce; however, few strong reactions have been reported. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Many researchers can demonstrate
          excess energy in the realm of 10 percent with very high
          repeatability, though only in the milliwatt range. [1] </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Strong reactions, achievement of
          higher power levels, have been difficult to obtain. The
          largest energy gain reported so far has been 2,500 percent by
          the Energetics Technology group from Israel.[2] Reports from
          other researchers show power in the tens of watts; however,
          these experiments are rare and difficult to repeat. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.3. Brief Review of Previous
            Fusion Cavitation Research</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The idea of using cavitation, the
          creation of rapidly expanding and collapsing cavities in
          fluids (bubbles), has been studied for many years by fusion
          researchers. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Roger Stringham of First Gate
          Energies started using acoustic drivers to induce cavitation
          in 1989. As is typical with cold fusion experiments, his
          research uses palladium and deuterium as the main components
          as well as the acoustic driver. As expected from cold fusion,
          his experiments do not produce significant levels of neutrons,
          the signature of a hot fusion reaction. Stringham has reported
          excess energy, in the form of heat, of 40 watts.[3] </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Rusi Taleyarkhan, a nuclear
          engineering and science professor with Purdue University, and
          colleagues published papers in Science [4] and Physical Review
          E[5] describing another <br>
          variation of acoustic cavitation, technically known as
          acoustic inertial confinement fusion. As is typical with hot
          fusion, Taleyarkhan's method does not use any host metal. His
          experiment runs in a room-temperature environment, and the
          bulk of the test liquid in the cells is at temperatures
          ranging from 0C to 15C. The fusion reactions take place in
          deuterium-bearing bubbles during the time span when
          sonoluminescence light flashes come - implosion conditions
          associated with high temperatures, plasmas and high pressures.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The main components of the system
          are a resonant acoustic test reactor filled with
          deuterium-bearing fluid (acetone is one such fluid), the
          acoustic driver system and a nuclear particle-based bubble
          nucleation source. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Significant levels of neutron
          emissions, commensurate with the expected branching ratios of
          hot fusion, are reported with this method. No excess energy is
          reported so far with this method. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.4. Mechanical Cavitation Using
            Hydraulic and Electrostatic Effects</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The new cavitation method uses high
          hydraulic pressures, high velocities and electrostatic
          effects. Two configurations are known. The first pumps machine
          oil in a fully enclosed recirculating system. 2,000 percent
          excess energy, in the form of heat, is reported by
          Koldamasov.[6] The second configuration uses a partially
          enclosed recirculating system, and products of heat, steam,
          hydrogen and helium were reported to New Energy Times by Yang,
          though no data has been presented. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>Figure 1. Photograph of
            Hydraulic-Electrostatic Cold Fusion Cell Using Machine Oil</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">1.5. Unique Characteristics of the
          Hydraulic-Electrostatic Cold Fusion Method This method differs
          markedly from both previous cold and hot fusion cavitation
          experiments. It differs from cold fusion work in that no host
          metal, such as palladium, is required. No deuterium gas or
          heavy water is required, and no electrochemistry is involved.
          The lack of electrochemistry requirements is a significant
          advance toward a commercial application, because
          electrochemistry is generally a very complicated,
          difficult-to-control environment. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The basic components of this method
          besides the cell, pictured above, are a pump motor used to
          recirculate the fluid and a heat exchanger to capture the heat
          energy. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Data has not been presented on the
          energy gain of the recent work; however, three cold fusion
          experts, electrochemist Martin Fleischmann (co-discoverer of
          cold fusion, and retired from the University of Southhampton),
          electrochemist Michael McKubre (SRI International), and
          physicist Peter Hagelstein have reported to New Energy Times
          that they have a high, though not absolute, level of
          confidence that the method is, in fact, exhibiting a positive
          energy balance. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In multiple demonstrations starting
          on June 6, 2005, Fleischmann, McKubre, Hagelstein and Krivit
          observed operators turn the device on and off at will, on
          demand. Observers noted that operators could increase or
          decrease the input to the machine, and in turn, the observers
          watched the machine respond directly with a correlated heat
          energy production, as displayed on the control console. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Tadahiko Mizuno, a nuclear engineer
          with Hokkaido University, visited another laboratory in Korea
          on Sept. 27, 2005, and witnessed a similar device, though the
          available instrumentation was insufficient for him to verify
          the claims of neutron emissions. The qualitative
          characteristics of this method appear to be 100 percent
          repeatable, sustainable over a period of minutes to hours, and
          controllable. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.6. Why Is This Cold Fusion?</b>
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Three dominant characteristics
          support the recognition of this method as a form of cold
          fusion. First, it apparently generates excess energy from
          hydrogen-based materials such as water or oil. Second, the
          reactions occur in a room-temperature laboratory environment.
          And third, based on reports from the Yang group, the branching
          ratios appear to follow those known of cold fusion
          experiments. Helium production is reported as the dominant
          byproduct, with relatively low levels of neutron and gamma
          emission. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><b>1.7. Conclusion</b> </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Confidently confirming the validity
          of the claimed excess heat and nuclear products in this work
          is difficult because sparse data has been presented by the
          researchers. People privileged with more in-depth knowledge
          have been constrained by nondisclosure agreements. Reports of
          independent audits have been mentioned to New Energy Times,
          yet such audits have not been made available to New Energy
          Times; the reason given is that the audits are the private
          property of the commercial and investment parties who have
          paid for them. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The claims are, needless to say,
          startling, profound and possibly auspicious. However, further
          attention to this research will require more detailed data.
          New Energy Times will seek the cooperation of Yang's research
          team to perform an audit and encourage additional disclosures
          by the researchers at the next ICCF conference. </p>

                  Fusion and Self-Induced Electric Discharges in

        <p style="text-align: left;">He4 production has been observed in
          an experimental setup which induces turbulence and cavitation
          in a flowing light-water solution containing B11. The assumed
          nuclear reaction, one of the most promising and ecologically
          benign, results from the absorption of a proton by the B11
          nucleus, and yields three He4 nuclei: P + B11 -&gt; 3He4. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">In this reaction, a substantial
          amount of energy (8.7 MeV) is released without the emission of
          neutrons or hard radiation, and the reaction products are
          non-radioactive. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Production of He4 was detected by
          observing the spectral emissions from a stationary luminous
          region of turbulent cavitating fluid immediately downstream
          from a flow-controlling orifice channel. He4 emission lines
          identified in the spectra were emitted with intensities
          indicating concentrations of helium substantially above
          background. These emissions were only observed when using B11
          solutions in the experimental setup, and after careful
          parametric optimization of the system. Additionally, a high
          rate of self-induced electrical discharges was observed
          traversing the luminous region and extending downstream for
          several centimeters. The effect of these discharges on helium
          production is currently under study. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Initial calorimetric measurements
          indicate a significant evolution of thermal energy along with
          the production of helium, as expected from the mass deficit of
          the reaction products. Some runs have also been carried out
          using the same experimental apparatus, but substituting
          machine oil for the boron solution. With the system optimized
          for the use of oil, directed beams of hard x-rays were <br>
          observed leaving the luminous region. The x-ray spectra
          resembled the emissions from heavy elements, possibly those
          present as contaminants in the oil. The beam directions
          appeared to be correlated with asymmetrical features of the
          luminous region. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Further studies, possible models
          and other theoretical considerations are discussed. </p>
