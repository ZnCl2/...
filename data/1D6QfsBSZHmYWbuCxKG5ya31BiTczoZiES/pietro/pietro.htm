        <p><b>This garden buggy runs on a tank of air, not petrol</b> <br>
          <b>(Image: CityWide)</b> </p>
        <p><img src="aircar.gif" height="148" width="200"></p>
      </center>
      <p>A garden buggy is the first commercially operated vehicle in
        Australia to use air as a fuel instead of petrol. But a critic
        says the air motor would be no use in cars. </p>
      <p>The vehicle, which is used to pick up garden material, will
        maintain the lawns of Melbourne's Fiztroy Gardens after its
        launch today. </p>
      <p>The vehicle runs on compressed air from a cylinder. The air is
        blown through a rotor, which then drives the motor. </p>
      <p>The engine's designer, Angelo Di Pietro from Melbourne company
        Engineair, said the motor has very low friction making it more
        efficient to run than other air-powered motors. </p>
      <p>Tests of the vehicle in the workshop showed it could reach
        speeds of 40 to 50 kilometres per hour on a flat surface but
        would run for only one hour before it needed to be recharged
        with more compressed air. </p>
      <p>But Di Pietro said this was still better than the similar sized
        battery-powered golf buggies, which take around eight hours for
        the battery to charge and create waste from old batteries. </p>
      <p>He added that there were also no emissions from compressed air
        vehicles like there were from petrol-driven vehicles. </p>
      <p>But Australian researcher and engineer specialising in motor
        research, Dr Andrei Lozzi from the University of Sydney, said
        air-powered motors were not anywhere near as efficient as motors
        that used fuel. </p>
      <p>"The problem with an air motor is the heat from compression
        escapes so you get less energy than you put into compressing the
        air," he said. </p>
      <p>"Somewhere down the line there is a fuel-driven mechanism that
        compresses the air," said Lozzi. </p>
      <p>The energy that went into this may be more than what was
        available from the motor, he said. </p>
      <p>A lot of hot air? </p>
      <p>The air-powered motor was also less efficient than motors that
        run on gas because energy is lost as heat as soon as compressed
        air is injected into the cylinder, he said. This meant it
        couldn't use the maximum energy available in the system. </p>
      <p>He said the air-powered vehicle could be convenient for short
        distances and may be more efficient than battery-powered
        vehicles, but it would be "no use" for passenger cars. </p>
      <p>Di Pietro agreed energy was lost as heat when compressed air
        cooled but said that his company had developed a system that
        could regain this heat. This system was not used in the new
        vehicle but could be used to make air-powered motors more
        efficient for passenger cars, he said. </p>
      <p>The system uses the energy in compressed air to take in heat
        from the atmosphere as well as air. This atmospheric air is then
        compressed to generate more heat, which in turn is used to drive
        the engine. </p>
      <p>Di Pietro said he could not go into any more detail because of
        commercial reasons. </p>
      <p>In response to the criticism that compressed air required more
        energy to make than it generated, Di Pietro said that energy
        also goes into the production of petrol, from searching and
        drilling for oil, to transport and delivery. </p>
      <p>"Petrol goes halfway around the world," he said. </p>
      <p>He added there was no reason the air could not be compressed
        with wind power or solar power if the technology was available.
      </p>
      <p>"The same way people now fill up with gas you could refill with
        compressed air," he said. But he said cars that ran on air would
        need a cylinder that could contain double the amount of
        compressed air cylinders currently held, and this would increase
        the price. <br>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Rotary Piston Engine</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Angelo Di Pietro</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Rotary Piston Engine is an engine which uses compressed air
        instead of petrol for its power source. </p>
      <p>Angelo believes his engine is the first of its type in the
        world. The engine has various applications including for both
        moving vehicles and stationary machines. </p>
      <p>The engine has been tested in a moving vehicle where it reached
        speeds of between 50kph and 60kph uphill. It has a range of 16km
        on a 100 litre cylinder but takes only a couple of minutes to
        refuel. As far as cost is concerned, 15 cents of air will get
        you 3.2km. </p>
      <p>Although yet to be tested, Angelo believes his engine may have
        greater application in powering stationary machines like
        industrial pumps in the petrochemical and mining industries
        where internal combustion engines can’t be used because of the
        risk of explosion. <br>
        Inspiration </p>
      <p>The inventor Angelo Di Pietro says he's been working on
        improved engine designs 'on and off' throughout his career as a
        mechanical engineer. His motivating force is a combination of
        altruism, professional satisfaction and material benefit for
        himself and his family. He admits he would 'like to make some
        money out of it' but, at the same time, he is equally motivated
        by a desire to help 'every individual take care of the
        environment'. <br>
        How does it work? </p>
      <p>The motor concept is based on a rotary piston. Different from
        existing rotary engines, Angelo's motor uses a simple
        cylindrical rotary piston (shaft driver), which rolls, without
        any friction, inside the cylindrical stator. The space between
        stator and rotor is divided in six expansion chambers by
        pivoting dividers. These dividers follow the motion of the shaft
        driver as it rolls around the stator wall. The cylindrical shaft
        driver, forced by the air pressure on its outer wall, moves
        eccentrically, thereby driving the motor shaft by means of two
        rolling elements mounted on bearings on the shaft. The rolling
        motion of the shaft driver inside the stator is cushioned by a
        thin air film. Timing and duration of the air inlet and exhaust
        is governed by a slotted timer which is mounted on the output
        shaft and rotates with the same speed as the motor. <br>
        Further information </p>
      <p>Variation of performance parameters of the motor is easily
        achieved by varying the time during which the air is allowed to
        enter the chamber: A longer air inlet period allows more air to
        flow into the chamber at high pressure and therefore results in
        more torque. A shorter inlet period will limit the air supply
        and allows the air in the chamber to perform expansion work at a
        much higher efficiency. In this way compressed air (energy)
        consumption can be exchanged for higher torque and power output
        depending on the requirements of the application. </p>
      <p>Motor speed and torque are simply controlled by throttling the
        amount or pressure of air into the motor. Angelo’s motor gives
        instant torque at zero RPM and can be precisely controlled to
        give soft start and acceleration control. <br>

        <p><b>Significant New Rotary Engine Design Runs on Compressed
            Air</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>September 15, 2004</i> --- There is no other motor as
        efficient as the Di Pietro Rotary Air Engine. It is 100% more
        efficient than any other air powered engine built to date and
        its high torque makes it the first air engine suitable for
        mobile applications. The invention has the capacity to
        revolutionise transportation, plus offer a multitude of
        energy-saving benefits in stationary applications. </p>
      <p>The engine has no emissions, is very quiet, has constant high
        torque, a low parts count, no vibration and is very efficient -
        only 1 PSI of pressure is needed to overcome the friction to
        enable movement. </p>

      <p>Former Mercedes Benz experimental engineer Angelo di Pietro
        conceived the Rotary Air Engine while working in his
        Melbourne-based Engineering business over many years. </p>
      <p>"I started work on this project many years ago in my head,"
        said Pietro, "and I have seen the need for such an engine many
        times. As my engineering business was doing okay, I was able to
        spend more time on the idea and with each new prototype the
        design has been refined." </p>
      <p>In 1999 he made a major design breakthrough and the first
        prototype was constructed. Since then, six prototypes have been
        built, each more efficient, more powerful and lighter than the
        previous one. </p>
      <p>It's not surprising that Di Pietro's design should be a rotary
        engine. Angelo Di Pietro, (1950, Avellino, Italy) qualified as
        Congegniatore Meccanico in Avellino moved to Stuttgart, Germany
        to work on the Wankel rotary engine at the Mercedes Benz
        research laboratories 1969 and 1970. In 1971 he migrated to
        Australia where he established a construction engineering
        company. </p>
      <p>From his early experience with Wankel rotary engines, Angelo
        became interested in developing a more efficient engine than the
        traditional reciprocating internal combustion engine, and he has
        worked on various alternative concepts intermittently over the
        last 30 years. </p>
      <p>Recognising the potential of his invention Di Pietro decided to
        fully focus on the development of the new motor concept. The
        principle worked with the first prototype and, although not
        built to fine engineering tolerances, its performance far
        exceeded expectations. </p>
      <p>Engineair Pty Ltd (http://www.engineair.com.au/) was
        established in September 2000, with the objective to perform
        research and development on the innovative air motor design. In
        the first 2 years the company focused on developing prototype
        models to test the concept and understand the performance
        characteristics. Current development status shows performance
        and efficiency to be superior over state of the art air motor
        technology. </p>
      <p>Engineair is now entering the commercialisation of its
        technology and is working on several fronts to prove the
        engine's capability. One of the first commercial applications
        will see the Engineair Rotary Air Engine applied in a commercial
        and outdoor environment by Melbourne-based CityWide which has
        replaced the petrol driven engine in one of its ParkCare garden
        maintenance vehicles (known as a 'gator'). </p>
      <p>The vehicle will be used on the company's City of Melbourne
        parks and garden maintenance contract. The project will run over
        2004-05 enabling CityWide to test the vehicle under different
        environmental conditions. </p>
      <p>Engineair has already successfully tested the powerplant in a
        roadgoing passenger car, a go-kart, a boat and as the power
        source for a utility vehicle for use in the Melbourne Fruit and
        Vegetable market, the latter project in conjunction with the
        Melbourne Market Authority. </p>
      <p>The Di Pietro motor concept is based on a rotary piston.
        Different from existing rotary engines, the Di Pietro motor uses
        a simple cylindrical rotary piston (shaft driver) which rolls,
        without any friction, inside the cylindrical stator. </p>

        expansion chambers by pivoting dividers. These dividers follow
        the motion of the shaft driver as it rolls around the stator
        wall. </p>
      <p>The cylindrical shaft driver, forced by the air pressure on its
        outer wall, moves eccentrically, thereby driving the motor shaft
        by means of two rolling elements mounted on bearings on the

        inlet and exhaust is governed by a slotted timer which is
        mounted on the output shaft and rotates with the same speed as
        the motor. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b>&nbsp; A non-reciprocating engine comprising a
        hollow cylindrical shaft driver (13) located in a cylindrical
        stator cavity (14) of a stator. A number of expansion chambers
        (43) form between the outer wall of the shaft driver, the stator
        wall and movable dividers (25) which extend from the stator to
        bear on the shaft driver. The expansion chambers expand and
        contract during operation of the engine. An output shaft passes
        centrally through the stator cavity and shaft driver and has
        offset bearings (34) which bear on the inside surface of the
        shaft driver. Inlet ports in a removable inlet end plate of the
        stator allow pressurised air or air/fuel mixture, for example,
        to be introduced into the expansion chambers. Sequential
        expansion and contraction of the chambers around the
        circumference of the shaft driver causes a combination of
        orbital and rotational movement of the shaft driver and
        consequential rotation of the output shaft. The shaft driver
        rotates at only a fraction of the speed of rotation of the
        output shaft (in the order of {fraction
        (1/10&lt;th&gt;-{fraction (1/20&lt;th &gt;the speed of rotation
        of the output shaft). One orbit of the shaft driver is
        equivalent to one rotation of the output shaft. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to motors or engines and more
        particularly to a crankless engine which may be in the form of
        an internal combustion engine, a fluid driven motor such as an
        air motor, or a steam driven engine. </p>
      <p>The term "crankless" refers to the fact that the motor does not
        have a conventional crankshaft and is not subject to
        reciprocating motion. The output shaft of the engine is in fact
        a straight shaft which is caused to rotate by offset bearings
        located in a drive member which may be termed a shaft driver,
        although in the strict sense, the motion of the so-called shaft
        driver is more an orbital motion with slow rotation relative to
        the speed of rotation of the output shaft. </p>
      <p>Many different forms of rotary and orbital engines as well as
        other forms of engines have been proposed in the past with
        varying degrees of success but overall there has been no serious
        challenge to the reciprocating internal combustion engine at
        least insofar as automobiles are concerned. This fact is
        primarily due to the high wear rate in rotary engines and
        possibly the fact that the improvements in efficiency of rotary
        engines over reciprocating engines has not been sufficient to
        justify a major change in direction for engine manufacturers. </p>
      <p>It is an object of this invention to provide an alternative
        form of a non-reciprocating type motor or engine which overcomes
        one or more of the shortcomings of prior art engines. </p>
      <p>Accordingly the invention provides an engine comprising a
        hollow cylindrical shaft driver located in a stator cavity of
        the engine and surrounded by expansion chambers defined between
        the cylindrical wall of the shaft driver and the wall of the
        stator cavity, said expansion chambers being separated by
        movable dividers mounted in said stator and bearing on said
        shaft driver, an output shaft rotatably supported in said stator
        and passing centrally through said stator cavity and through
        said shaft driver, said shaft having bearing means to one side
        of said shaft which bear on the inside surface of said shaft
        driver whereby a combination of orbital and rotational movement
        of said shaft driver causes rotation of said shaft at a
        rotational speed much greater than the rotational speed of said
        shaft driver. </p>
      <p>In order that the invention may be more readily understood one
        particular embodiment will now be described with reference to
        the accompanying drawings which show an air driven engine. In

        show a cycle of the shaft driver within the stator cavity to
        produce a single revolution of the output shaft. </p>
      <p>In the drawings, the engine is shown to comprise essentially a
        stator 10, an inlet end plate 11 and a output shaft 12. A shaft
        driver 13 is a hollow cylindrical ring which, when the engine is
        assembled, is located in a cylindrical stator cavity 14 of the
        stator 10. </p>
      <p>The inlet end plate 11 has an inlet manifold 15 mounted
        centrally on the outer end thereof and a removable end cap 16
        provides an air intake 17 to the inlet manifold 15. The inlet
        manifold 15 (see FIG. 7) fits over a cylindrical boss 45 of the
        end plate 11 and is locked onto the boss 45 by grub screws (not
        shown). The rotational position of the manifold 15 relative to
        the boss 45 may be adjusted to vary the timing of the engine. As
        is evident flexible pressure hoses 18 extend from the inlet
        manifold to inlet ports 19 in the end plate 11. The interior of
        the end cap 16 communicates with ports 20 (see FIG. 7), each of
        which communicates with one of the pressure hoses 18 to
        distribute inlet air at air intake 17 to the respective inlet
        ports 19 via the pressure hoses 18. The ports 20 are opened or
        closed by a timing member 36 locked to the inner end of output
        shaft 12 as will be described hereinafter. The end cap 16 is
        fixed to the inlet manifold 15 by bolts 21 which extend axially
        and enable the end cap 16 to be clamped firmly to the inlet
        manifold 15 in an airtight arrangement. A roller bearing 22 is
        located in the end plate 11 to support the output shaft 12. </p>
      <p>As is more evidence in FIGS. 5 and 8, the stator 10 has a
        cylindrical stator 14 which is larger in diameter than the
        diameter of the shaft driver 13. The wall 23 of the stator 10
        has part cylindrical grooves 24 which extend arcuately from a
        point in the stator cavity through the wall 23 and back to the
        stator cavity at a circumferentially displaced location. These
        grooves 24 accommodate respective movable dividers 25 which are
        able to move in the respective grooves 24 whereby an edge of a
        moveable divider 25 bears on the outer surface of the shaft
        driver 13. As is evident in FIG. 8 for example, the movable
        dividers 25 are part cylindrical dividers with a end portion 26
        which supports an axial shaft 27 on which the divider pivots.
        The axial shaft 27 extends through a hole 46 in the stator 10
        and passes out the end of the stator. As can be seen more
        clearly in FIG. 11, a spiral spring 28 locates in a slot in the
        end of each axial shaft 27 and is fixed to the stator 10 in
        order to bias pivotal movement of the respective moveable
        divider in a manner whereby an edge of the divider bears on the
        shaft driver 13. A further roller bearing 29 is located in the
        stator to support the output shaft 12. As is apparent in the
        drawings, holes 30 in the stator 10 and corresponding holes 31
        in the end plate 11 enable the two parts to be bolted together
        in sealing engagement by bolts (not shown). </p>
      <p>As is evident in FIGS. 5 and 11, exhaust ports 32 extend from
        the cylindrical stator cavity 14 through the fixed end of the
        stator 10 to allow exhaust air to dissipate to atmosphere. In
        addition to these exhaust ports 32, which allow primary exhaust
        air to dissipate at the opposite end of the stator 10 to the
        inlet manifold 15, a further or secondary exhaust route is
        provided via the inlet ports 19 and the inlet manifold 15. The
        secondary exhaust route follows the inlet air path back to the
        start of the ports 20 and a timing member or disc member 36.
        (FIG. 13) which bears on the outer surface 39 (FIG. 10) of the
        inlet manifold 15. A recessed portion 37 of the timing or disc
        member 36 allows one of the ports 20 to communicate with the
        bore of the timing disc 36. The bore of the timing or disc
        member 36 is a clearance fit over output shaft 12 (creating
        space 40) and thus any exhaust air forced back via the inlet
        manifold to timing or disc member 36 is captured within the
        recessed portion 37 and forced into space 40. As radial hole 47
        in the inlet manifold extend to the space 40 and provides an
        exhaust outlet for this secondary exhaust air. </p>
      <p>The output shaft 12 consists essentially of a straight shaft
        that is mounted in the roller bearings 22 and 29 of the inlet
        end plate 11 and stator 10, respectively. A driven plate 33 is
        mounted on the shaft and in the assembled engine locates within
        the shaft driver 13. The driven plate 33 has mounted thereon a
        pair of roller bearings 34 which are closely adjacent to each
        other and to one side of the shaft. The roller bearings 34 bear
        on the inside wall of the shaft driver 13 and are driven around
        the inner perimeter of the shaft driver 13 as will become
        apparent hereinbelow. The driven plate 33 is arranged to be
        rotationally balanced with the roller bearings 34. At the inner
        end of the shaft 12 a nut 35 retains the timing disc 36 on the
        shaft. The timing or disc member 36 has recessed portion 37 in a
        surface 38 of the timing or disc member 36 which bears on the
        outer surface 39 of the inlet manifold 15. As is evident in FIG.
        10, the manifold 15 fits over the output shaft 12 and a space 40
        exists therebetween. The recessed portion 37 as it moves around
        on the outer surface 39 exposes the ports 20 to the space
        between the inlet manifold and the shaft. The previously
        described radial hole 47 in the inlet manifold communicates with
        the space 40 and enables further exhausting of air in an
        expansion chamber of the engine as will become apparent
        hereinbelow. </p>
      <p>A cut-out portion 42 in the circumference of the timing or disc
        member 36 exposes the ports 20 to inlet air pressure from the
        air intake 17. The timing or disc member 36 is therefore
        responsible for timing functions related to inlet air pressure
        and secondary exhaust air from the expansion chambers. </p>
      <p>As will be evident in FIG. 5 and FIG. 14, expansion chambers 43
        of the engine are formed between the outer surface of the shaft
        driver 13, the surface of the stator cavity 14 and between the
        dividers 25 where they contact the surface of the shaft driver
        13. These expansion chambers 43 take varying shapes as the shaft
        driver 13 moves within the stator cavity 14. In order to better
        understand this movement, reference should now be made to FIG.
        14 which shows a cycle of the engine resulting in a complete
        revolution of the output shaft 12. The engine is driven in this
        embodiment by compressed air and air under pressure is therefore
        connected to air intake 17 on the end cap 16. A suitable valve
        (not shown) is provided in order to open the supply of
        compressed air. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 14, the four expansion chambers are labelled (a), (b),
        (c) and (d) for convenience in explaining a cycle of operation.
        Referring to FIG. 14(i), the expansion chamber 43(a) is
        receiving pressurised air because the timing member 36 is
        positioned on the end of the inlet manifold so as to expose the
        relevant port 20 to the pressurised air. Pressure in expansion
        chamber 43(a) creates a force against the side of the shaft
        driver 13 causing it to move in a direction whereby its contact
        with the surface of stator cavity 14 moves in an anti-clockwise
        direction. In other words, the shaft driver 13 does not
        specifically rotate but moves in a type of motion whereby the
        point or surface contact between it and the stator cavity 14
        moves around the circumference of the stator cavity 14. Further
        expansion of the chamber 43(a) causes the shaft driver 13 to
        assume a position as shown in FIG. 14(ii) and at this point in
        time, the shaft has rotated through 90.degree. as shown by the
        position of the roller bearings 34 which are forced to remain in
        a space available internally in the shaft driver 13 by virtue of
        its offset position relative to the axes of the output shaft 12.
        This rotation of the output shaft 12 through 90.degree. causes
        the timing member 36 to expose the next relevant port 20 to high
        pressure air which then enters the expansion chamber 43(b)
        further pushing the shaft driver 13 around within the stator
        cavity 14. </p>
      <p>It should be mentioned at this time that whilst the movable
        dividers are spring biased so that an edge thereof remains in
        contact with the outer surface of the shaft driver 13, pressure
        in an expansion chamber also acts via arcuate grooves 24 on the
        edge of the divider 25 not in contact with the shaft driver 13,
        to thereby assist in applying pressure between the divider and
        shaft driver. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 14(iii), it can be seen that the cycle
        continues and in the position shown in FIG. 14(iii), the shaft
        has rotated 180.degree.. In this position, compressed air is
        being received in expansion chamber 43(c) whilst chambers 43(a)
        and 43(b) have been fully expanded. It should be noted that
        movement of the shaft driver 13 has exposed exhaust port 32 in
        chamber 43(a) whereby subsequent contraction of the chamber
        43(a) by further movement of the shaft driver allows some of the
        air in chamber 43(a) to exhaust via the exhaust port 32. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 14(iv), the shaft driver 13 has moved to a new
        position whereby the output shaft 12 has rotated through
        270.degree. from the initial position. In this position, the
        exhaust port 32 shown in FIG. 14(iii) has been closed by the
        movement of the shaft driver 13 but the chamber 43(a) is still
        contracting. This contraction of chamber 43(a) would compress
        air in that chamber if there was no other means for the air to
        escape. Such means is provided by the previously described
        secondary exhaust route. This enables air to return via the
        appropriate inlet port 20, into the recessed portion 37 of the
        timing member 36 and then into the space 40 between the inlet
        manifold and output shaft to eventually exit via exhaust port or
        radial hole 47. This means that the expansion chamber 43(a) can
        continue to contract in size as is evident in FIGS. 14(iii) and
        14(iv) without compressing air in that chamber and resisting
        such movement. Similar events occur as the other chambers
        contract. In the next step of the cycle the components resume
        the position shown in FIG. 14(i). </p>
      <p>As will be evident from the above description, the shaft driver
        13 moves in the stator cavity 14 whereby contact between the
        outer circumference of the shaft driver 13 and the surface of
        stator cavity 14 moves around the cavity 14 as each expansion
        chamber receives compressed air. This movement may be considered
        as a type of orbital movement and whilst the shaft driver 13
        does not rotate at the same speed as the output shaft 12, there
        is some rotation of the shaft driver 13. The speed of rotation
        of the shaft driver 13 depends upon the difference in
        circumference between the shaft driver and the stator cavity 14.
        Generally speaking, the shaft driver 13 rotates at a speed of
        about 1/12.sup.th to 1/20.sup.th of the speed of rotation of the
        output shaft 12. This provides a distinct advantage in that
        there is minimal wear between the surface of the movable
        dividers 25 where they contact the shaft driver 13 and the
        surface of the shaft driver 13. This is because there is little
        rotation of the shaft driver 13 relative to the output shaft 12.
        As will also be evident, rotation of the output shaft 12 is
        caused by the roller bearings 34 moving, or remaining, in the
        space provided for them within the shaft driver 13. </p>
      <p>The direction of rotation of the output shaft 12 is simply
        reversed by rotating the manifold 15 on the cylindrical boss 45.
        The rotation of the manifold will expose next port 20 to the
        cut-out portion 42 in the circumference of the timing member 36
        to communicate the interior of the end cap 16 with chamber 43(b)
        instead of chamber 43(a) as per FIG. 14(i). </p>
      <p>Whilst the embodiment described above relates to an engine
        driven by compressed air, clearly other types of engines may be
        readily constructed. For example, by providing spark plugs in
        the stator cavity 14 for each expansion chamber and introducing
        a fuel/air mixture into the engine, an internal combustion
        engine may be provided. Also, the engine could be driven by
        steam or by other fluid means. It is also conceivable that an
        internal combustion engine embodiment of the invention could
        drive a vehicle as well as an air compressor in the vehicle
        whereby during certain times, the fuel air mixture could be
        turned off and the engine could run from compressed air provided
        by the compressor. This would have advantages where fuel is not
        available or where pollution by internal combustion engine
        exhaust is a sensitive issue. For example, within certain city
        limits internal combustion engines may be prevented from use in
        the future and an engine of the type described herein could be
        run on compressed air for periods of time whilst in these areas.
      </p>
      <p>It should be apparent that the engine according to the present
        invention offers many advantages over existing engines. For
        example, the engine is non-reciprocating and therefore is
        essentially vibration free. There are fewer moving parts and
        minimum friction resulting in a much more efficient engine with
        minimum wear. The output shaft of the engine is a straight shaft
        and therefore avoids many of the inherent balancing and
        vibration problems of existing reciprocating engines. In order
        to increase the output power of the engine according to this
        invention, it is merely necessary to provide additional stator
        assemblies on the same output shaft. The engine is compact and
        lighter than existing engines and this results in improved
        efficiency. </p>
      <p>Whilst one particular embodiment has been described in detail,
        it should be evident to persons skilled in the art that
        variations may be readily effected without departing from the
        spirit and scope of the invention. Clearly additional parts can
        be added to provide a production version of the engine. For
        example, it would be necessary to provide an outlet manifold
        covering the exhaust ports 32 in order to direct the exhaust air
        to a single exhaust outlet point. Also, a fly-wheel (not shown)
        would be provided in order to contribute to the smoother running
        of the engine. <br>
