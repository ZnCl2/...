      <p>14 Nov 2008 </p>
      <p>AUBURN HILLS, Mich., Nov. 14 /PRNewswire/ -- Who would have
        thought that a forty-five millimeter long invention could
        improve engine performance, reduce emissions and fuel
        consumption by twenty percent?&nbsp; Continental, one of the
        world's largest automotive suppliers, developed such an
        innovative technology and is the first to mass-produce the
        gasoline Piezo direct injection system. </p>
      <p>"We are very proud of our Piezo direct injection technology and
        the contributions it brings toward our goal of reducing fuel
        consumption and emissions," said Kregg Wiggins, Senior Vice
        President Powertrain, Continental NAFTA - Region. </p>
      <p>Continental's Powertrain division is the pioneer of Piezo
        injection technology. It is part of the wide range of products
        that Continental supplies today -- from optimized tires,
        electronics and mechanical components -- that combined could
        reduce fuel consumption by up to 40 per cent.&nbsp; Production
        of the first generation of Piezo injectors for diesel engines
        began in 2000. Production of gasoline Piezo began in 2006.&nbsp;
        Continental is the market leader in Piezo direct injection
        systems. </p>
      <p>"We believe there will be a significant demand for direct
        injection technology moving forward as a direct result of the
        benefits to the end consumer," said Wiggins.&nbsp; "The Piezo
        direct injectors offer our customers the latest technology to
        significantly reduce carbon dioxide while simultaneously taking
        fuel economy to new levels." </p>
      <p>This completely integrated system takes full advantage of the
        fast switching speeds and precise fuel metering of Piezo
        technology, making it possible to use a spray-guided
        stratification combustion process in a gasoline engine for the
        first time ever. </p>
      <p>During the combustion process, gasoline is directly injected
        into the combustion chamber near peak pressure to better utilize
        the fuel, resulting in a combustible mixture formed in the upper
        part of the combustion chamber in the immediate area of the
        spark plug. In this way, the innovation creates the conditions
        for a stratified charge. </p>
      <p>Spray-guided combustion, which is the most efficient form of
        stratified charge, is only possible with the performance
        features of Piezo technology because a precise, constant and
        stable injection must be directed to the immediate spark plug
        area. The nozzle needle completes its full stroke in just 0.2
        milliseconds, while the maximum deviation between individual
        injected quantities of fuel is 2 percent -- even with the
        typically short injection pulses under driving conditions. </p>
      <p>For cleaner combustion, extremely fine atomization of the fuel
        must be maintained. At an injection pressure of approximately
        200 bar, the average diameter of the fuel droplets is only 15
        thousandths of a millimeter. Together with injector nozzles that
        open into the engine cylinder, an optimally prepared cloud
        mixture at the edge of the spark plug is yielded under nearly
        all operating conditions. This innovation is the only solution
        on the market able to do this. </p>
      <p>This spray-guided combustion process is a first in a gasoline
        engine, and as a consequence, the extent of operating conditions
        that allow stratified charge is considerably expanded. For
        example, high displacement engines are able to achieve greater
        fuel economy at partial loads, while ensuring optimum cylinder
        charging at full load.&nbsp; Additionally, OEMs may be
        interested in using the injector to more tightly control
        combustion processes, including multiple pulses to control the
        start of combustion.&nbsp; This technique is an enabler to
        someday allow them to realize Homogeneous Charge Compression
        Ignition (HCCI). </p>
      <p>Continental today received the first Environmental PACE
        (Premier Automotive Suppliers' Contribution to Excellence) Award
        from Automotive News for its trend-setting gasoline Piezo direct
        injection technology which improves engine performance, reduces
        emissions and fuel consumption by 20 percent.&nbsp; This is the
        third award the Piezo technology has received.&nbsp; The system
        was also recognized during Ward's 10 Best Engine's of 2007 for
        the BMW 335i Twin Turbo-3-liter engine contribution and the
        Automotive News 2008 PACE Award. </p>
      <p>According to Automotive News, this year's honorees were chosen
        from the 2008 Automotive News PACE Award winners and were
        honored again for further innovations contributing to the
        environmental sustainability and/or solving environmental
        problems. </p>

              Injection</font></b> </p>
        <p><i><font size="+1">Gasoline Direct Injection Strategy Helps
              Engines Meet Emissions Targets Without Sacrificing
              Horsepower</font></i></p>
      </center>
      <p>Auburn Hills, Mich., April 03, 2006 </p>
      <p>Siemens VDO is helping customers take a more direct route in
        their efforts to meet impending fuel economy regulations by
        offering gasoline direct injection technology that improves
        vehicle fuel economy. Direct injection fuel delivery injects
        gasoline directly into the engine's combustion chamber, enabling
        the vehicle to start with less fuel while simultaneously
        improving vehicle drivability and emissions. </p>
      <p>"Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) offers the customer a more
        efficient, cleaner combustion solution by directly injecting the
        fuel into the combustion chamber near peak pressure to better
        utilize the gasoline," said Siemens VDO North American Director
        of Powertrain Gasoline Systems Mike Crane. "Direct injection
        provides a precisely metered charge to the cylinder that allows
        beneficial engine design and operating changes - like a higher
        compression ratio - to be employed on the engine. GDI
        fundamentally promotes more stable combustion giving the
        customer better performance and lower hydrocarbon and carbon
        dioxide emissions with no sacrifice in engine performance. The
        technology also offers multi-fuel capabilities for emerging E85
        applications." </p>
      <p>Siemens VDO currently is pursuing a dual strategy of
        solenoid-actuated and piezo-actuated direct injection to address
        the needs of diverse customer market segments and models. The
        core components of both these gasoline direct injection systems
        are the injectors, the EMS 2 engine management system with
        corresponding software and a high-pressure fuel pump. </p>
      <p>"Piezo Direct Injection (PDI) offers the customer the greatest
        possible fuel savings throughout an extended engine operating
        range by facilitating stable lean combustion in stratified
        operation," said Crane. "Compared with a conventional port
        injection, PDI helps reduce fuel consumption by 20 percent,
        depending on the total level of system integration, including
        engine downsizing." </p>
      <p>The Solenoid Direct Injection (SDI) system is a cost effective
        solution offering significant opportunities to save fuel, reduce
        emissions and boost torque at lower engine speeds compared to
        port injection systems. The Deka DI XL2 injector delivers the
        versatility required for variable injection through enhanced
        linearity, very fast opening and closing times and varying
        nozzle designs for swirl or multi-stream spray geometry for
        optimal adaptation to specific engine requirements. </p>
      <p>The company also has developed a new high-pressure pump with
        greater flow control accuracy that requires less power from the
        engine to operate compared to competitive pumps. The pump
        generates fuel pressures of up to 20 MPa (200 bar) and works on
        the transfer principle. The moving parts are contained in an oil
        chamber separated from the fuel system by a stainless-steel
        diaphragm to minimize the drive torque, while simultaneously
        preventing oil contamination of the fuel. </p>
      <p>"Whether it is a solenoid or piezo system, the Siemens VDO
        Direct Injection solution is the more direct route to meeting
        Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) and emissions targets for
        the internal combustion engine, while maintaining – and in some
        cases improving – performance and drivability," said Crane... </p>

      <p>Piezo technology in particular highlights our major
        contribution to the development of injection systems. We were
        the first company to put this technology into series production
        for diesel engines, and are now again up with the frontrunners
        using piezo injectors in gasoline engines. </p>
      <p>By using Piezo direct injection, we facilitate stable lean
        combustion in stratified operation, thereby achieving the
        greatest possible fuel savings throughout an extended engine
        operating range. Compared with a conventional gasoline engine
        with port injection, this technology can reduce fuel consumption
        by up to 20%, depending on the type of vehicle and driving
        cycle. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; The problem during overrun fuel cut-off
        operations, i.e. cut-off of fuel injection during trailing
        throttle conditions of the vehicle, is that the transition
        entails an undue torque jump, resulting in the smooth operation
        of the engine and the driving comfort of the passengers of the
        vehicle being affected. The aim of the invention is to reduce
        the torque jump. Said aim is achieved by injecting fuel into a
        cylinder of the Otto engine in a multiple injection process, at
        least a partial quantity of the fuel that is to be injected
        being injected during the compression phase, whereby the
        quantity of air that is taken in advantageously decreases
        because no internal cooling takes place while the efficiency is
        advantageously reduced due to the lesser degree of swirling,
        resulting in lower torque.; Overall, torque (DM) is reduced to a
        significantly greater extent than by merely adjusting the spark
        angle (ZW) while smooth operation of the Otto engine is not
        affected. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> ---&nbsp; During the changeover from a first
        operating mode of a spark-ignition engine with direct fuel
        injection to a second operating mode, in particular between a
        homogeneous stoichiometric and homogeneous lean, stratified or
        HCCI operation with changeovers of the valve stroke or the valve
        phase, there is the risk of an undesired torque jump, which can
        lead to a perceptible jolting of the vehicle or to a disturbance
        in the running of the spark-ignition engine. The invention thus
        proposes, in particular in the case of an inadmissibly large
        torque jump, the initiation of a multiple injection of fuel in
        addition to the conventional compensation by the displacement of
        the ignition angle. A partial quantity of said fuel is injected
        during the compression phase to reduce the degree of efficiency,
        thus reducing the torque produced. </p>

        the greatest possible driving comfort. Conventionally, a
        compromise is used for the optimisation of the injection with
        regard to all the above criteria, with the use of a only a few
        parameters to describe the actual driving situation, above all
        engine speed and load. The full potential of modern internal
        combustion engines with multiple injections is, as a rule, not
        fully realized as a result of said compromise and taking into
        account of little environmental data.; According to the
        invention, said problem may be resolved, by means of
        establishing a classifier (1), which continuously selects one of
        several different optimisation strategies and then
        correspondingly controls the direct injection system or other
        related control systems. The overall performance of the engine
        management can thus be advantageously improved. </p>

        <b>Method for the drift compensation of an injector for the

          engine as well as a device</b> </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> --- In the case of direct injection internal
        combustion engines, the problem occurs that especially the
        injection of a minimum amount of fuel depends in particular on
        different operating parameters such as the speed, the start of
        the injection or the rail pressure. Therefore, a method or a
        device is suggested in which a control unit ( 10 ) subdivides
        the complete range of values of at least one operating parameter
        into discrete sections. Subsequently, for each section, at least
        one operating point is specified for which a corresponding
        correction value depending on the operating parameter is
        determined and obtained. The correction value is then stored
        together with its corresponding operating point. This has the
        advantage that the correction value can be determined more
        accurately because interpolation can for example also be
        performed between two operating points. </p>
