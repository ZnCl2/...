            Months?&nbsp; Yes!</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Imagine milk kept fresh in the refrigerator for months.
      Far-fetched?&nbsp; Not at all, say Cornell University food
      scientists, who believe they have a way to keep dairy products
      fresh and fortified for several months -carbonation, the same kind
      added to carbonated drinks, but at lower levels.<br>
      <br>
      "This will further enhance the safety of refrigerated, pasteurized
      milk by ensuring that pathogenic bacteria will not grow," said
      Joseph H. Hotchkiss, Cornell professor of food science. He and
      colleagues previously demonstrated that dissolved CO2 can extend
      the shelf life of cottage cheese by about 200 percent. Modified
      milk has been found to last more than two months in a
      refrigerator, and it still tastes fresh and contains no dangerous
      bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      While carbonation has been used in soda for more than a century,
      the process has not been applied to milk because the microbial
      activity of low amounts was unknown and because the carbonation
      would dissipate in milk cartons. Further, the method for inserting
      the carbonation was not efficient. Thanks to advanced packaging
      technologies and more efficient carbonation processes, a new style
      of fortified milk now is possible.<br>
      <br>
      Consumers needn't worry that milk now will start tasting like
      soda: the amount of carbonation injected into the milk is below
      the threshold of taste detection, according to Hotchkiss, but it
      is enough to stave off harmful bacteria.&nbsp; "How much CO2 must
      be added depends on a number of factors," he said. "The upper
      limit is the amount which can be tasted in the fluid milk. The
      lower limit depends on the desired shelf life and degree of
      barrier in the package."<br>
      <br>
      The research was reported in an article, "Modified Atmosphere
      Packaging of Fluid Dairy Foods for Consumer and Institutional
      Markets," as part of the 1995 annual report of the Northeast Dairy
      Foods Research Center, the group that funded the study.<br>
      <br>
      "The amount of CO2 used is very small. The equipment to store and
      add the CO2 are relatively simple, and they are a one-time cost,"
      Hotchkiss said. "The largest cost generally is in the improved
      packaging materials and equipment. Longer shelf life requires
      better carton barriers, which cost more."<br>
      <br>
      While the technology used to insert the CO2 was tested in the
      cottage cheese industry, the cartons to contain the fortified milk
      are made for the orange juice industry. Thanks to ethylene vinyl
      alcohol (EVOH) coated cartons, Hotchkiss believes that fluid milk
      will be able to maintain the carbonation.<br>
      <br>
      "Right now, it's our barrier of choice," he said. "Whether
      consumers accept this new technology or not will be settled in the
      marketplace."&nbsp; The technology could have far-reaching effects
      beyond the grocer's shelves. Hotchkiss said that fluid milk
      carbonation might have uses during the transport of raw milk over
      long distances. In some parts of the country, during the summer in
      Florida for example, milk is imported from northern states because
      Florida's heat severely reduces dairy production. Injecting CO2
      into raw milk before it is processed improves the chances that the
      milk arrives safely.<br>
      <br>
      A process like this could mark a significant shift in how
      consumers regard milk. About 11 percent of consumers' total food
      expenditures are for dairy products, according to the report.
      "Consumers demand high quality, and they are sensitive to quality
      defects when purchasing dairy products. Off-flavors are easily
      detected, especially in fluid milk," Hotchkiss said. "Adding CO2
      is an economical way to extend the shelf life and improve the
      quality of perishable foods in home storage as well as in retail
      distribution."<br>

            Products to Improve Quality: A Comprehensive Review</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Changes in distribution patterns and demand for increased food
      quality have resulted in a desire to improve the shelf life of
      nonsterile dairy products. Refrigerated shelf life extension
      typically requires, at a minimum, reductions in the growth rate of
      spoilage microorganisms and subsequent product deterioration.
      Reducing initial bacterial loads, increasing pasteurization
      regimes, and reducing postprocessing contamination have all been
      employed with measured success. The use of antimicrobial additives
      has been discouraged primarily due to labeling requirements and
      perceived toxicity risks. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally
      occurring milk component and inhibitory toward select dairy
      spoilage microorganisms; however, the precise mechanism is not
      fully understood. CO2 addition through modified atmosphere
      packaging or direct injection as a cost-effective shelf life
      extension strategy is used commercially worldwide for some dairy
      products and is being considered for others as well. New CO2
      technologies are being developed for improvements in the shelf
      life, quality, and yield of a diversity of dairy products,
      including raw and pasteurized milk, cheeses, cottage cheese,
      yogurt, and fermented dairy beverages. Here we present a
      comprehensive review of past and present research related to
      quality improvement of such dairy products using CO2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Microbiological Effects of Carbon Dioxide</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Milk and dairy products are excellent growth media for pathogenic
      and spoilage microorganisms, hence the major (but not only)
      mechanisms of the deterioration of dairy foods are directly or
      indirectly microbiological (Muir 1996a, 1996b, 1996c). The
      composition of most dairy products provides a favorable physical
      and chemical environment for the growth and propagation of a broad
      spectrum of microorganisms. Microbiological deterioration of
      refrigerated raw and pasteurized milk, cottage cheese, and similar
      products is often caused by the growth of psychrotrophic
      gram-negative bacteria species (Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter,
      Flavobacterium, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Aerobacter, Escherichia,
      Serratia, Proteus, Aeromonas, and Alcaligenes), yeasts, and molds
      (Geotrichum, Scopulariopsis, Mucor, Alternaria and Penicillium)
      (Ternstrom and others 1993; Jay 2000; Boor and Murphy
      2002;Chambers 2002), resulting in flavor, textural, and visual
      spoilage. In a study of pasteurized milk samples from 3 commercial
      dairy plants, Fromm and Boor (2004) identified the heat-resistant
      psychrotrophic gram-positive rods Paenibacillus, Bacillus, and
      Microbacterium as the predominant spoilage organisms. It has been
      estimated that 25% of all milk shelf life problems are due to
      thermoduric psychrotrophs, primarily Bacillus spp. (Ternstrom and
      others 1993; Sorhaug and Stepaniak 1997). These organisms produce
      extracellular protease and lipase activity, which reduces the
      functionality of milk proteins, and often produce undesirable
      aromas, many of which can be described as “fruity.” Gram-positive
      organisms, particularly those producing lactic and acetic acids,
      can spoil dairy foods, but the numbers of organisms required are
      generally higher than for gram-negative bacteria and the changes
      can be less noticeable. The growth of heat-resistant lactic
      acid-producing cocci is responsible for the depression of
      pasteurized milk pH to the point where curdling occurs (Jay 2000).<br>
      <br>
      Over the last 4 decades several investigators have demonstrated
      that adding CO2 to the atmosphere surrounding a product reduces
      the rate of growth of many food spoilage and pathogenic
      microorganisms (Farber 1991; Hanlin and others 1995; Devlieghere
      and others 1998; Devlieghere and Debevere 2000). The largest
      inhibition occurs with gram-negative psychrotrophs, particularly
      Pseudomonas spp., and the least inhibition effect generally
      observed with gram-positive psychrotrophs, particularly
      Lactobacillus spp. (King and Nagel 1967, 1975; Molin 1983;
      Hendricks and Hotchkiss 1997). Factors such as species, substrate,
      and CO2 concentration influence the effect on pathogenic
      psychrotrophs (Bennik and others 1995).<br>
      <br>
      There are at least 3 general mechanisms by which CO2 inhibits
      microorganisms. The 1st and simplest is by the displacement of O2.
      The 2nd mechanism is a lowering of the pH in the medium or food
      due to the dissolution of CO2 and formation of carbonic acid in
      the aqueous phase of the food in the following equilibrium (Butler
      1982):<br>
      <br>
      The 3rd mechanism is a direct effect on the metabolism of
      microorganisms as opposed to the indirect effects of pH reduction
      and displacement of O2 (Daniels and others 1985).<br>
      <br>
      Several reports on the effect of CO2 on microbial growth and
      survival have appeared in recent years. The most common
      experimental design in defined media replaces some portion of the
      air surrounding the growth media with CO2. Unfortunately, the
      media has not always been buffered to negate large shifts in pH
      due to CO2 dissolution and formation of carbonic acid in the
      media, so it is unclear if the effect is simply due to a reduction
      in pH or if CO2 has an inhibitory effect not associated with
      reduced pH. Furthermore, these experiments are often conducted in
      film pouches that allow permeation of both O2 and CO2 and the
      composition of the atmospheric changes over the course of the
      experiment. Microbial and/or fruit and vegetable respiration also
      contributes to the atmospheric changes. Thus, the relative
      importance of each of these factors in inhibiting growth or
      respiration may not be apparent due to several factors changing at
      the same time.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of CO2-modified atmospheres on the growth of
      Pseudomonas fluorescens and Listeria monocytogenes in highly
      buffered nutrient solution under either constant O2 (20%) and
      varying concentrations of CO2 (0 to 80%) or constant CO2 (20%) and
      varying concentrations of O2 (0 to 40%) (balance N2) have been
      investigated. Bacterial suspensions were incubated at 7 °C under a
      continuous flowing atmosphere of each gas mixture in order to
      better understand the relative significance of pH, O2 depletion,
      and direct effects of CO2 on growth (Hendricks and Hotchkiss
      1997). The results showed that CO2 suppresses growth, even when
      the amount of O2 in the atmosphere is held constant at 20% and the
      media does not change pH. This agrees with previous workers who
      concluded that CO2 directly inhibits microbial growth in dairy
      products as opposed to the indirect effects of pH and O2
      displacement (King and Mabbitt 1982). Using empirical data and
      modeling, Devlieghere and others (1998) have concluded that the
      main variable controlling microbial growth in modified atmosphere
      packaging (MAP) is the dissolved CO2 concentration.<br>
      <br>
      While these experiments show that CO2 has a direct effect on the
      metabolic processes of certain microorganisms, the mechanism
      through which this effect is manifested is not well characterized.
      There is evidence to support at least 3 mechanisms, including
      changes in membrane fluidity due to CO2 dissolution (Sears and
      Eisenberg 1961), reductions in intracellular pH, and direct
      inhibition of metabolic pathways, including decarboxylation
      reactions and DNA replication (Dixon and Kell 1989; Hong and Pyun
      2001).<br>
      <br>
      Because CO2 is highly soluble in hydrophobic materials such as
      lipids, it may be that the CO2 concentrates in the lipid bacterial
      cell membrane, disrupting the physiochemical properties of the
      membrane. It may also be that the lipophilic nature of CO2 allows
      it to pass through membranes and concentrate inside the cell,
      lowering intracellular pH. Intracellular CO2 could stimulate
      “futile cycles”; carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions,
      which are common to all cells, could be stimulated without
      beneficial outcomes, resulting in a net energy expenditure and
      loss of ATP. Lastly, CO2 may interfere directly with required
      enzymatic processes within cells, including gene expression
      (Stretton and others 1996; Stretton and Goodman 1998).<br>
      <br>
      <b>CO2 Processing and Packaging Technology</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Modified atmosphere packaging compared to direct addition
        of CO2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of several general approaches to extending the shelf life of
      refrigerated nonsterile food products is MAP technology (Farber
      and Dodds 1995). MAP is defined as the replacement of the
      headspace gas surrounding a food product with a gas mixture
      different from air. The objective of this technology is to slow
      the growth of spoilage microorganisms and/or inhibit senescence
      and respiration of fruits and vegetables. MAP has become widely
      practiced in food storage and distribution (Brody 1995). In
      addition to altering the gas composition surrounding the food, a
      barrier packaging material is often employed to retard the
      dissipation of the modified atmosphere through the package
      material. The shelf life of MAP products often directly correlates
      with the barrier properties of the package. Unfortunately, higher
      barrier materials are more costly and a cost-benefit trade-off
      must be determined. Surrounding a food with a gas mixture is an
      indirect method of adding the gas to the product due to
      solubilization of the gas in the water phase. This is particularly
      true for CO2, which dissolves rapidly in foods and can create a
      vacuum inside of rigid packages containing high moisture foods
      (Parry 1993).<br>
      <br>
      MAP of dairy products, including cottage cheese and fluid milk,
      has been reported to retard microbial growth (Kosikowski and Brown
      1973; Mannheim and Soffer 1996) but requires substantial changes
      in the form of the traditional package. In most cases, packaged
      dairy foods do not have sufficient headspace to serve as a
      reservoir for the active gases (for example, CO2) and insufficient
      CO2 may be available to retard microbial growth. In the case of
      dairy products, MAP may not provide sufficient control and the
      shelf life of the product may be inconsistent (Moir and others
      1993). However, flushing packages with CO2 before sealing is
      commonly used to inhibit mold growth in certain cheeses (Farkye
      and Vedamuthu 2002).<br>
      <br>
      The direct injection of 5.68 to 22.7 mM CO21 directly into
      products coupled with high barrier packaging has been developed as
      a method to inhibit undesirable microorganisms in dairy products
      and thus extend shelf life (Chen and Hotchkiss 1991a, 1991b).
      Liquefied or compressed CO2 gas can be incorporated directly into
      a flowing stream of product via a gas-sparging unit, a process
      commercially practiced in several areas of the world. The device
      that is most often employed consists of a sintered stainless steel
      frit with porosity in the range of 7 to 30 μm. The process has
      been termed “direct addition of carbon dioxide” in order to
      distinguish it from conventional MAP. The net effect is similar to
      MAP; the gas is added to the product for the purpose of increasing
      shelf life by inhibiting microbial activity. The cost of the
      addition of CO2 to dairy foods via this method is generally
      economically feasible, and the incorporation of CO2 typically
      occurs within the normal stream of product in a production system.
      Only a minimal one-time investment is required for equipment, and
      the cost of CO2 gas is low; the most significant and recurring
      cost involved is in barrier packaging.<br>
      <br>
      Several authors have pointed out that in extending shelf life,
      atmospheric CO2 first dissolves in the undissociated form into the
      liquid phase of the product before inhibiting respiratory and
      microbial systems (Barnett and others 1971; Daniels and others
      1985). Thus, CO2 in the atmosphere in MAP is not the effective
      agent per se in the inhibition of microorganisms. The CO2 must
      first dissolve into the product and eventually into microbial
      cells. The amount of CO2 dissolved in water is governed by the
      partial pressure of the CO2 above the water as well as the amount
      of CO2 available, which is determined by both the volume of the
      headspace and the concentration of CO2 in that headspace.<br>
      <br>
      Rather than rely on an equilibrium being established between the
      headspace in a package and the product, it has been suggested that
      the direct addition of CO2 into products may result in improved
      microbial control by ensuring a constant low concentration of
      dissolved CO2 (Gorski 1996). Henry's law illustrates that as the
      aqueous concentration of CO2 increases, the partial pressure of
      CO2 (pCO2) increases accordingly at a fixed temperature. If the
      temperature of the product is controlled, the concentration of CO2
      within the aqueous liquid will remain constant, assuming a closed
      system and no loss of CO2. This process has advantages over
      conventional MAP in that no headspace is required and the amount
      of dissolved CO2 can be carefully controlled.<br>
      <br>
      Fluid whole or reduced fat milk comprises both hydrophilic aqueous
      and hydrophobic fat portions. Both the temperature at which direct
      CO2 injection occurs into milk and the milk fat content influence
      the degree to which CO2 is dissolved in the skim portion of the
      milk. Ma and Barbano (2003a) looked at freezing point and pH of
      milk with different fat contents in response to CO2 injection at 0
      and 40 °C. Their data showed that at the low injection temperature
      the CO2 content in the skim portion can be very different between
      milks having different fat contents. Data also indicated that CO2
      injection into milk at low temperatures results in more gas
      dissolved in the skim portion of the cream, suggesting that the
      antimicrobial effect of CO2 would be maximized as more of the gas
      is available in the aqueous phase.<br>
      Effect of packaging materials<br>
      <br>
      One of the most important factors affecting the use of direct
      addition of CO2 to dairy products has been the lack of sufficient
      barrier in the packaging materials. There is little benefit to
      adding CO2 to a product if the gas is allowed to dissipate.
      Packaging is the principal means of preserving the original
      concentration of CO2 within the product. CO2 has been found to
      decrease rapidly during storage when dissolved in cottage cheese
      samples and packaged in conventional polystyrene plastic tubs
      (Moir and others 1993). The conventional polyolefin tubs used in
      cottage cheese packaging are highly CO2 permeable and the simple
      friction closure offers little resistance to outgassing. The CO2
      is lost through the gaps between the cover and the tub since the
      container is not airtight. A solution to this problem is to add a
      high CO2 barrier foil/polyolefin laminant seal over the opening of
      a high CO2 barrier tub or shrink-wrapping the standard polystyrene
      container with a high barrier film (Gorski 1996). Another solution
      is to package the cottage cheese in high CO2 barrier film pouches.
      This could also facilitate disposal, especially at an
      institutional level.<br>
      <br>
      Lee and Hotchkiss (1997) studied the increase in standard plate
      counts in CO2-modified cottage cheese packaged in 2.3 kg high
      barrier polymer bags. As expected, the combination of the high
      barrier bags and the addition of CO2 to the product reduced
      microbial growth rate and increased shelf life. CO2 concentration
      did not decrease from initial levels over 29 d of storage,
      suggesting that the combination of temperature (4 °C) and high
      barrier material was successful at maintaining the residual CO2
      levels.<br>
      Safety issues<br>
      <br>
      The safety risks associated with extending the shelf life of a
      nonsterile food must be understood. With refrigerated products,
      including MAP or CO2-treated dairy foods, the major risk is that
      the increased shelf life will allow development of slow-growing
      pathogenic microorganisms that would not be manifest in products
      with shorter shelf lives; an additionally important risk is that
      certain pathogens will be stimulated. Understanding the effects of
      CO2 on pathogenic psychrotrophs such as L. monocytogenes is of
      particular importance. CO2 has the added concern that it could, in
      theory, enhance the outgrowth (germination) of pathogenic
      spore-forming organisms such as Bacillus cereus and Clostridum
      botulinum (Dixon and others 1988).<br>
      <br>
      We have investigated the effect of added CO2 on B. cereus and C.
      botulinum growth and toxigenesis in milk (Glass and others 1999;
      Werner and Hotchkiss 2002). While CO2 at levels of &lt;20 mM
      inhibits the growth of selected spoilage organisms and extends
      refrigerated shelf life, CO2 could influence the risk of botulism
      from milk. In the latter study (Glass and others 1999),
      pasteurized 2% fat milk was modified with approximately 0, 9.1, or
      18.2 mM CO2 and inoculated with a 10-strain mixture of proteolytic
      and nonproteolytic C. botulinum spore strains to yield 101 to 102
      spores mL-1. The milk was stored at 6.1 °C for 60 d or 21 °C for 6
      d in sealed glass jars or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic
      bottles. Milk stored at 21 °C curdled and exhibited a yogurt-like
      odor at 2 d and was putrid at 4 d. Botulin was detected in milk
      containing 9.1 mM CO2 after 4 d and in all treatments after 6 d of
      storage at 21 °C. All toxic samples were grossly spoiled based on
      visual evaluation at the time the toxin was detected. Although
      botulin appeared earlier in milk treated with 9.1 mM CO2 compared
      to both the 18.2 mM and untreated milk, gross spoilage would act
      as a deterrent to consumption of toxic milk. No botulin was
      detected in any treatment stored at 6.1 °C for 60 d. At 6.1 °C,
      the standard plate counts (SPC) were generally lower in the
      CO2-treated samples than in controls, with 18.2 mM CO2 milk having
      the lowest SPC. These data indicate that the low-level addition of
      CO2 retards spoilage of pasteurized milk at refrigeration
      temperatures and does not increase the risk of botulism from
      treated milk stored at refrigeration or abuse temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      We have conducted similar studies of the effects of 11.9 mM CO2 on
      the growth of B. cereus spores inoculated into sterile homogenized
      whole milk at 101 and 106 spores mL−1 and stored at 6.1 °C for 35
      d (Werner and Hotchkiss 2002). B. cereus counts from CO2-treated
      and control milk both decreased over 35 d. There was no
      consistency as to whether the control or test milk was higher in
      counts. Added CO2 reduced the pH of the milk from an average value
      of 6.61 to an average value of 6.31; however, this drop did not
      correlate with changes in any other parameter measured. The data
      indicated that moderate levels of CO2 neither enhance the
      outgrowth of B. cereus over long-term storage nor increase the
      risk of foodborne illness due to the organism.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of CO2 on growth of L. monocytogenes and C. sporogenes
      in cottage cheese have also been investigated (Chen and Hotchkiss
      1993). C. sporogenes did not grow under any conditions tested
      while L. monocytogenes grew slowly in control cheese at 4 and 7
      °C. The addition of CO2 resulted in a slight inhibition of growth
      of L. monocytogenes. Other workers have shown that the addition of
      CO2 does not promote growth and is likely to cause a small but
      significant inhibition. For example, Fedio and others (1994) found
      that CO2 inhibited growth of L. monocytogenes in cottage cheese.<br>
      <br>
      To our knowledge, no data to date indicate the use of CO2 to
      extend the keeping quality of dairy products increases the risks
      from pathogenic microorganisms. The data generated from
      investigations of L. monocytogenes suggest that CO2 treatment may
      result in enhanced safety for this pathogen, which has been the
      causative agent in human disease in which dairy foods were the
      vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Carbon Dioxide as a Natural Ingredient of Raw Milk</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It has been known for over 100 y that milk as drawn from animals
      contains significant amounts of dissolved CO2. However, early
      quantitative data must be viewed with caution, as analytical
      methods for dissolved gases were less reliable than those more
      currently employed. Early researchers were interested in how CO2
      affects processing (Noll and Supplee 1941), collection (Marshall
      1902; Jackson 1936), freezing point (Moore and others 1961; Smith
      1964), and the ability to distinguish pasteurized from raw milk
      (Van Slyke and Baker 1919; Van Slyke and Keeler 1920; Frayer
      1941).<br>
      <br>
      Van Slyke and Baker (1919) suggested that a third of the CO2 in
      milk exists as carbonic acid and two-thirds as bicarbonate.
      However, modern physical chemistry shows that the fraction of
      carbonate, bicarbonate, and CO2 ions varies in solution as a
      function of pH (Daniels and others 1985). In milk at pH 6.3 to
      6.5, approximately 88% of CO2 exists as dissolved CO2 gas, 2% as
      carbonic acid, and the remaining 10% as bicarbonates. At 15 °C,
      concentrations of CO2 added to raw milk in the range of 0.4 to
      33.6 mM lowered the pH from 6.80 to approximately 6.1 (Martin
      2002). In autoclaved raw milk similarly amended at lower
      temperatures (4 °C) with 0 to 35 mM CO2, the pH was lowered from
      6.70 to 5.9 (Loss 2001).<br>
      <br>
      The CO2 content of raw milk decreases when milk is exposed to air
      after milking while O2 and N2 levels increase (Marshall 1902). The
      loss in CO2 results from gradual equilibration of the milk gas
      content with that of air, which has a lower atmospheric pCO2.
      Jackson (1936) suggested that “anaerobically drawn” milk contained
      11.1 to 12.5 mM CO2. Noll and Supplee (1941) analyzed 63 samples
      of mixed raw milk as received at a commercial milk plant,
      reporting the CO2 level to be 2.0 mM. This agreed with Frayer
      (1941) who showed that, prior to receipt at the processing plant,
      there is a significant loss in CO2 from milk. Noll and Supplee
      (1941) showed that CO2 levels are significantly reduced in several
      processing steps. Our limited analyses for CO2 content of raw milk
      from a single local herd using modern methodology averaged 5.5 mM,
      with a range of 3.9 to 7.5 mM (n= 10 animals) (Lee 1996).<br>
      <br>
      CO2 losses occur during the pasteurization treatment in response
      to temperature and pressure changes during processing. Smith
      (1963) found a drop in the CO2 content from 1.6 mM in raw to 0.68
      mM in processed milk. The CO2 loss was attributed to the aeration
      of milk during pumping and nonhermetic storage of milk. Further
      significant decreases in CO2 were observed for vacuum-treated and
      pasteurized milk. Moore and others (1961) reported an average loss
      of CO2 from milk after pasteurization of 72% when a single vacuum
      chamber was placed after the raw regeneration loop.<br>

      </b><b><br>
        Raw (unpasteurized) milk</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Introduction Reports on the use of CO2 at elevated pressures as an
      antimicrobial agent in milk date back to the turn of the 20th
      century. Hoffman (1906) reported that the addition of 50
      atmospheres2 of CO2 reduced the rate of increase in the microbial
      counts in milk. While untreated milk curdled within 24 h at room
      temperature, milk kept under 10 atm of CO2 was not observed to
      curdle, even after 72 h. Van Slyke and Bosworth (1907) observed
      that elevated CO2 pressures delayed lactic fermentation. They
      suggested that the best results in the preservation of milk were
      secured when newly pasteurized milk or “cleanly drawn” raw milk
      was treated with CO2 in tanks such as is used in bottling
      establishments to prepare carbonated drinks. Similar discoveries
      regarding the relationship between pCO2 and microbial activity in
      raw milk were reported by other laboratories in the early part of
      the century (Prucha and others 1922; Donald and others 1924;
      Valley and Rettger 1927).<br>
      <br>
      Storage and transport More recent investigations have documented
      the chemical and microbiological effects of low levels of added
      CO2 in raw milk (Skudra 1983). In a series of pioneering studies,
      King and Mabbitt (1982), Mabbitt (1982), and Law and Mabbitt
      (1983) added 10 to 40 mM CO2 to untreated whole and
      bacteria-inoculated sterilized skim milk stored at 4, 7, and 10 °C
      for up to 6 d. Increasing CO2 concentrations and decreasing
      temperatures were shown to inhibit microbial growth rates; these
      effects were greatest when the 2 parameters were manipulated
      together. The enhanced effects were most likely due to the
      combination of reduced growth rate and increased solubility of CO2
      as the temperature is lowered. The lower the initial counts in the
      untreated milk and the lower the holding temperature, the greater
      the effect. They also demonstrated that the initial microbial
      quality of the raw milk influences the effect of CO2. The
      difference between SPC in &lt;4 log cfu mL−1 milk treated with CO2
      and the same milk left untreated was as much as 3 log units after
      6 d, while the difference between &gt;5 log cfu mL−1 milk treated
      with CO2 and controls was less than 1 log cycle (Mabbitt and King
      1982). Milk with an initial count &gt;5 log cfu mL−1 held at 10 °C
      demonstrated only a small benefit from CO2. Addition of 20 to 30
      mM of CO2 to milk collected from tankers unloading farm milk had
      approximately 3 log cfu mL−1 fewer counts than untreated milk
      after 4 d storage at 7 °C. Milk acidified with HCl to the same pH
      as the CO2-treated milk failed to demonstrate the same degree of
      microbial inhibition. King and Mabbitt (1982) concluded that the
      effect was directly due to the presence of CO2, not due to
      lowering the pH or to the displacement of oxygen. These data
      indicate that greater benefit from the addition of CO2 is gained
      in a high-quality product as compared to a poor-quality product.<br>
      <br>
      Roberts and Torrey (1988) inoculated sterile milk with several
      common proteolytic psychrotrophic bacteria isolated from milk and
      investigated the effects of 20 to 30 mM CO2 on growth at 7 °C.
      They found that lag time increased and exponential growth rate
      decreased in the presence of increasing dissolved CO2 for both
      inoculated and uninoculated raw milk. There was no evidence that
      CO2 increased the growth of anaerobic and facultative organisms,
      including spore formers. They concluded that refrigerated storage
      of raw milk could be extended 1 to 3 d by the addition of low
      amounts of CO2. Amigo and others (1995) investigated the effects
      of “acidification” of inoculated, sterilized, and raw milk as well
      as the effects on sensory properties; CO2 was used to reduce an
      initial milk pH of 6.7 to 6.2 and 6.0. Unfortunately, the
      concentration of CO2 required for these reductions in milk pH was
      not determined, making it difficult to directly compare results
      with other studies. CO2 treatment increased generation times and
      decreased growth rates for several Pseudomonas spp. Sensory
      evaluation of degassed and pasteurized milk resulted in no
      detectable differences between treated and untreated samples.
      Samples that were not degassed scored significantly lower than
      controls, perhaps due to the tactile sensations associated with
      higher levels of dissolved CO2.<br>
      <br>
      Espie and Madden (1997) reported the effects of 30 and 45 mM CO2
      on the indigenous microbial populations in raw milk stored at 6 °C
      for up to 7 d. Sample analysis included enumeration of SPC,
      coliforms, psychrotrophic count, and lactobacillus. All with the
      exception of lactobacillus demonstrated inhibition with the
      addition of CO2. The authors concluded that an extension in
      keeping quality could be achieved by the addition of CO2 to the
      raw milk.<br>
      <br>
      Martin and others (2003) examined the effects of 0.6 to 61.4 mM
      CO2 on bacterial growth in both raw and inoculated sterile milks
      during storage at 15 °C and found that these concentrations
      significantly inhibited the growth of raw milk bacteria. SPC of
      natural populations in raw milk and populations of Pseudomonas
      fluorescens, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria
      monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus licheniformis
      in inoculated sterile milk were examined. For raw milk SPC, as CO2
      concentrations increased, the time to maximum growth and lag time
      increased while the growth rate decreased. For each specific
      microorganism studied, CO2 reduced the growth rate, with a greater
      effect toward gram-negative than toward gram-positive bacteria.
      The lag time for P. fluorescens incubated with 0.4 mM CO2 was 3.3
      h compared to 26.1 h with 46.3 mM CO2. Similar effects were noted
      for L. monocytogenes. For B. cereus, slight decreases in growth
      rate and no change in lag time were noted with increasing CO2
      concentration; the growth rate of B. licheniformis did not change
      while the lag time increased. These results show that, even at
      above-refrigeration temperatures, CO2 can reduce the growth of
      milk pathogens and spoilage organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Rajagopal and others (2005) examined microbial growth in aged and
      fresh raw milks from a single herd after treatment with 68 to 689
      kPa CO2 at 5, 6.1, 10, and 20 °C, and storage for up to 9 d,
      parameters that did not result in protein precipitation. All
      treatments significantly reduced raw milk SPC, even those
      incorporating above-refrigeration temperatures. At the highest CO2
      pressure, a reduction in SPC, total gram-negative bacteria, and
      lactobacillus were measured at the end of storage. At 6.1 °C, the
      time to reach 4.30 log cfu mL-1 increased by 4 d as compared to
      the untreated control. Coliform levels remained unchanged in these
      treated samples while levels doubled in the control milk. The
      level of thermoduric bacteria was significantly lower after 9 d in
      the treated milk than in the control milk. In the United States,
      the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) Grade A regulations specify
      an upper SPC limit for raw milk prior to pasteurization of 5 log
      cfu mL−1 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1999); at
      6.1 °C, this limit was reached in the control milk before 4 d of
      storage while this limit was not reached in 689 kPa CO2-treated
      milk until day 8. These data suggest that pressurized CO2 might be
      an effective method of preserving raw bulk milk, adding to storage
      shelf life and overall milk quality.<br>
      <br>
      A scaled-up field application trial of this work by our research
      group (unpublished data) supports these laboratory data, by
      preliminarily showing that application to 18,900 L raw bulk milk
      of 45 mM CO2 under pressures of 138 to 345 kPa can significantly
      extend storage time. Milk was stored in a stainless steel liquid
      bulk tank used for rail shipment under ambient (20 to 25 °C)
      conditions outdoors. The temperature of the milk loaded was
      initially 2 °C, which slowly increased to about 10 °C by day 14 of
      storage. Standard plate count analysis shows that the treated milk
      did not reach the PMO quality limit until day 14, 4 d longer than
      that for the control milk, suggesting that moderate CO2 pressures
      can be an effective method of storing bulk raw milk and extending
      possible transport time.<br>
      <br>
      ProcessingCalvo and De Rafael (1995) suggested that CO2 should be
      removed prior to pasteurization to minimize buildup of deposits on
      the walls of the pasteurizer. Beaulieu and others (1999) showed
      that in a model milk system, increasing soluble protein content
      and decreasing pH increases aggregation of caseins under HTST
      pasteurization temperatures, a condition that could result in the
      fouling of heat processing equipment. The pH of milk treated with
      0 to 54 mM CO2 during pasteurization was found to decrease in
      response to increases in pressure and in CO2 concentration; at a
      fixed CO2 concentration, the effect of pressure on decreasing milk
      pH was greater at higher temperature treatments, while at a fixed
      temperature, the effect of pressure on decreasing milk pH was
      greater at higher CO2 treatment concentrations (Ma and Barbano
      2003c). Ma and others (2001) found that pH depression caused by
      modification of milk with up to 23 mM of CO2 could be reversed by
      vacuum removal of CO2. At 80 °C and 345 kPa pressure, the pH of 55
      mM CO2-modified milk can be as low as 5.63; thus, pasteurization
      temperatures and pressures as well as the initial CO2 content of
      milk are important factors to regulate to prevent milk degradation
      during pasteurization (Ma and Barbano 2003c). If these factors are
      modulated, CO2 may be used as a processing aid during
      pasteurization to increase microbial kill. Loss (2001) showed that
      increasing concentrations of dissolved CO2 in raw milk between 1
      and 36 mM linearily decreased the decimal reduction time at 50 °C
      (D50 values) for P. fluorescens, and CO2 concentrations of 44 to
      58 mM significantly reduced the z value for SPC (63 to 93 °C). A
      more comprehensive review of the bactericidal effects of dissolved
      CO2 during pasteurization has been prepared by Loss and Hotchkiss
      (2003).<br>
      <br>
      If left in the milk postpasteurization, 23 mM CO2 was not found to
      significantly impact antibiotic residue, freezing point, infrared
      milk component, or alkaline phosphatase tests, important analysis
      used in the United States to determine antibiotic contamination,
      water adulteration, protein/fat/lactose content, and effectiveness
      of pasteurization in reducing microbial load (respectively) of
      fluid milk (Ma and others 2001). Ruas-Madiedo and others (1996)
      reported the results of a pilot-scale study in which sufficient
      CO2 was added to 200-L batches of raw milk to lower the pH to 6.0
      or 6.2 (CO2 concentrations not reported). The milk was held at 4
      °C for 4 d, vacuum treated to remove residual CO2, and
      pasteurized. The milk samples were evaluated organoleptically,
      microbiologically, and chemically. Neither caseins nor whey
      proteins were affected by the combined treatment of CO2 addition,
      vacuuming, and pasteurization. Generally, the organic acid content
      of the milk was not different, with the exception of lactic acid,
      which was slightly lower in CO2-treated milk. The volatile organic
      compound concentration of the treated product was lower,
      presumably because of lower microbial activity. No significant
      differences in sensory properties were detected. The only major
      difference was that the CO2-treated milk had lower coliform,
      psychrotrophic, proteolytic psychrotrophic, and lipolytic
      psychrotrophic counts compared to untreated raw milk after 4 d of
      storage. The authors concluded that CO2 could be added to raw milk
      to inhibit microbiological deterioration during storage and easily
      removed during processing without detrimental effects. Later, this
      same group and others reported that the additional shelf life
      gained by the addition of CO2 did not affect fat- or water-soluble
      vitamin (Ruas-Madiedo, Bada, and others 1998a, 1998b) or free
      monosaccharide (Ruas-Madiedo and others 2000) content of raw milk.<br>
      <br>
      The effects of direct addition of CO2 to raw milk on milk quality
      after CO2 removal and pasteurization have been recently
      investigated (Thongoupakarn 2001). Carbon dioxide (14.8 to 22.7
      mM) was added to raw milk, which was held at 4 °C for up to 10 d
      before CO2 removal and subsequent HTST pasteurization and storage
      at 6 °C for 30 d in HDPE plastic bottles. Raw and pasteurized
      milks were assayed for SPC, gram-negative psychrotroph counts
      (Gm–), proteolysis, lipolysis, and pH. The percentage of casein
      nitrogen over total nitrogen (CN/TN) was used as an index for
      proteolysis, while acid degree value (ADV) was used as an index
      for lipolysis.<br>
      <br>
      CO2-treated raw milk had lower microbial counts prior to
      pasteurization, exhibiting lower growth rate and longer lag phase
      after pasteurization than non-CO2-treated milk. The degree of
      proteolysis and lipolysis of pasteurized milk was also reduced by
      CO2 addition. The differences in ADV and casein content of
      CO2-treated pasteurized milk as compared to non-CO2-treated
      pasteurized milk were greatest for raw milk, which had reached SPC
      values of &gt;6 log cfu mL−1 prior to pasteurization (those stored
      raw for 10 d). The time to reach SPC of 6 log cfu mL−1
      postpasteurization was also affected by CO2 treatment. Similarly,
      Ma and others (2003) showed that raw milk stored under 34 mM CO2
      at 4 °C resulted in reduced growth of milk bacteria and subsequent
      reduced overall proteolysis and lipolysis.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that the addition of CO2 to milk retards the growth of
      selected psychrotrophic gram-negative organisms as well as the
      deterioration of raw milk stored under refrigeration. Moreover,
      inhibition of microorganisms in raw milk improves the overall
      quality of pasteurized milk. While the use of CO2 in refrigerated
      raw milk has been investigated, less work has focused on the
      potential effects of CO2 on raw milk held at temperatures above
      normal refrigeration temperatures (7 to 10 °C) or under changing
      temperature conditions experienced during bulk transport. While
      the inhibitory effects of CO2 are diminished as the temperature
      increases, relatively small reductions in growth rates could be
      important for raw milk that is not adequately refrigerated. CO2
      addition could be a low-cost means for improving milk quality in
      regions where low-temperature refrigeration is inadequate. Rashed
      and others (1986) reported that CO2 had little effect on raw milk
      held at 20 °C compared to storage at 7 °C. However, the initial
      bacterial counts in the raw milk were high (approximately 106 cfu
      mL−1) and it is possible that lower initial counts would have
      resulted in a significant difference in growth rates.<br>
      <br>
      CO2 removal CO2 removal from raw milk immediately prior to
      pasteurization is feasible by applying vacuum treatment. Such
      equipment is commercially available; for example, the Feldmeier
      Aro-Vac (Syracuse, N.Y.), to remove off-flavors or to deaerate
      milk. Moore and others (1961) used commercially available nonsteam
      flavor removal equipment to degas CO2-treated raw milk prior to
      HTST pasteurization. Ruas-Madiedo, Bada-Gancedo, and others (1996)
      constructed a pilot-scale pasteurizer and vacuum degassifier
      system to remove CO2 prior to subsequent HTST pasteurization. Raw
      milk was modified with CO2 (quantities not reported) to reduce the
      milk pH to levels between 5.9 and 6.3. CO2- treated raw milk was
      first heated to 55 to 60 °C in a plate-pasteurizer, pumped into a
      secondary tank where a 300-mmHg vacuum was applied, pumped into
      another plate pasteurizer for a HTST treatment of 72 °C/15 sec,
      and finally cooled to 38 °C. Gevaudan and others (1996) applied
      5.8 mmHg vacuum at room temperature to remove CO2 from milk that
      had been similarly acidified. In the Bada-Gancedo and others
      (1996) study, analysis of the milk before and after pasteurization
      showed little difference in terms of sensory and biochemical
      properties. Similarly, results obtained from by Amigo and others
      (1995) showed that sensory properties of CO2-treated milk after
      degasification and pasteurization were no different than for
      untreated pasteurized milk. Recent research reports
      laboratory-scale vacuum treatments combined with mild heating for
      the effective removal of CO2 from raw milk (Ma and others 2001;
      Santos and others 2003; Rajagopal and others 2005).<br>
      <br>
      Other methods have been used to successfully degasify CO2-treated
      raw milk prior to pasteurization. In an early study (Noll and
      Supplee 1941), it was found that gas flushing, vacuum treatment,
      or the treatments in combination were effective in removing low
      levels of CO2. More recently, Thongoupakarn (2002) used a flowing
      stream of nitrogen gas immediately prior to HTST pasteurization to
      reduce CO2 levels from 14 to 19 mM to 1 to 2 mM. Rajagopal and
      others (2005) used a combination of depressurization and mild
      temperatures (30 to 35 °C) to degas CO2 amended milks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Pasteurized milk</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The feasibility of using direct addition of CO2 to pasteurized
      milk for shelf life extension has not been extensively
      investigated, probably due to the assumption that added CO2 would
      detrimentally affect the organoleptic quality of milk (King and
      Mabbitt 1982). However, preliminary work has suggested that the
      levels of CO2 below the organoleptic threshold are inhibitory for
      selected microbial growth (Shipe and others 1982; Duthie 1985;
      Duthie and others 1985). Carbon dioxide levels of 1.81 to 3.18 mM
      in full-fat pasteurized milk stored in paperboard cartons at 6 °C
      for up to 14 d improved keeping quality. Trained sensory panelists
      found no difference between the control (no CO2) and CO2-treated
      milk prior to 14 d. However, at day 14 the highest CO2-treated
      samples scored significantly higher than untreated milk.
      Psychrotrophic and total bacterial counts were similarly lower in
      treated samples. Control milk coagulated during testing while the
      treated samples did not. The sensory threshold for CO2 in this
      work was 740 mg L−1, which was above the highest CO2 level tested.
      These preliminary data suggested that the addition of CO2 to
      pasteurized milk could significantly improve keeping quality
      (Duthie and others 1985).<br>
      <br>
      The use of CO2 in pasteurized milk has been investigated in more
      detail. Work with inoculated milk packaged in pouches with
      different CO2 barrier properties showed that the addition of low
      levels of CO2 inhibits the growth of psychrotrophic microorganisms
      and provides a moderate extension of shelf life (Chen and others
      1992; Hotchkiss and others 1998). Lag-phase extension, growth rate
      reduction, and maximum bacterial counts in 0 to 21.5 mM
      CO2-treated inoculated whole milk increased directly with
      increasing CO2 content. The inhibitory effect of CO2 was greater
      at 4 °C than at 7 °C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cheeses</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      CO2 and storage Hard and semi-hard cheeses, such as cheddar, are
      commonly packed in 100% CO2 or mixtures of CO2–N2 using horizontal
      form-fill-seal (FFS) pouch-pack equipment. MAP cheese packed in
      polypropylene film has a shelf life of up to 4 wk, compared to
      only 14 to 15 d when packaged under normal conditions. The major
      effect of CO2 on these cheeses is the inhibition of surface mold
      growth (Maniar and others 1994), although high CO2 MAP atmospheres
      have been shown to inhibit growth of lactic and mesophilic
      bacteria as well as that of molds and yeasts on shredded
      mozzarella cheese (Eliot and others 1998). CO2 acts both directly
      on molds and by indirectly displacing O2; molds have an absolute
      requirement for O2. Vacuum packaging does not remove all of the O2
      and thus mold and yeast growth can still occur (Hocking and Faedo
      1992), particularly in regions of the food product–packaging
      interface where package wrinkling occurs. MAP with reduced O2
      combined with increased CO2 concentration will allow mold growth
      but at a substantially reduced rate, thus extending shelf life.
      CO2 also is absorbed into the cheese and creates a vacuum within
      the pouch. Sliced and grated cheeses can be pillow-packed under
      MAP (Fierheller 1991). The gas mixture typically used is 70%
      N2:30% CO2 to inhibit mold growth, to keep the package from
      collapsing around the shreds, and to prevent shred matting (Parry
      1993). In this case, the N2 acts as filler to prevent package
      collapse and formation of a vacuum as the CO2 is absorbed. Alves
      and others (1996) have compared 100% N2 and 100% CO2 with 50%
      N2:50% CO2 for packaging sliced mozzarella cheese in high-barrier
      laminated films. They reported that atmospheres of ≥50% CO2 were
      more effective than air or 100% N2 in improving shelf life of
      sliced mozzarella cheese. Atmospheres of 100% N2 had only a minor
      effect on sensory shelf life but atmospheres of 100% CO2 increased
      shelf life by 385%. Molds, yeast, and psychrotrophic bacteria were
      all inhibited by the 100% CO2. Eliot and others (1998) found
      similar benefits of CO2 in shredded mozzarella cheese.
      Gonzalez-Fandos and others (2000) recently demonstrated that
      packaging in 50% CO2:50% N2 or 40% CO2:60% N2 effectively
      inhibited undesirable chemical and microbiological changes in
      cheese and extended shelf life. Juric and others (2003), however,
      found that packaging atmospheres of 100% CO2 resulted in
      undesirable changes in texture and flavor of sliced Samso cheese
      stored under light. Elevated CO2 packaged cheese became dry and
      crumbly, and developed off-flavors, colors, and aromas due to
      increased photooxidation.<br>
      <br>
      CO2 and cheese manufacture The effect of CO2 treatment of raw milk
      intended for manufacturing cheese has been investigated. Calvo and
      others (1993) found that acidification of raw milk with CO2 to pH
      between 6.0 and 6.5 reduced psychrotrophic bacteria counts,
      resulting in improved cheese yields. However, the differences were
      small and the initial microbial counts were in the range of 105 to
      107 cfu mL−1 in the controls, making it unclear if similar results
      would been seen with lower initial counts. Other studies
      (Ruas-Madiedo, Alonso, and others 1998; Ruas-Madiedo, Bada
      Gancedo, and others 1998) looked at milk of lower microbial load
      and found that cheese yields from CO2-treated and -untreated
      stored milk did not differ significantly. In poor quality milk,
      however, yield of the control milk was significantly less than
      yield achieved in the CO2-treated milk. In this study, CO2 was
      removed prior to cheese making, and the cheese was acid
      coagulated. McCarney and others (1995) have also investigated the
      effects of CO2 addition to milk used to make cheese. They
      concluded that the addition of 30 mM of CO2 reduced the time to
      reach psychrotrophic counts of 106 cfu mL−1 and that this in turn
      improved grading scores. The cheese made from CO2-treated milk
      showed fewer products of casein and lipid breakdown, presumably
      due to reduced proteolytic and lipolytic activity. Montilla and
      others (1995) showed a 75% reduction in the amount of rennet
      necessary for coagulation along with a small reduction in
      proteolysis in cheeses made with CO2-treated milk. The effect of
      CO2 on cheese yield was not clear from the data. There was no
      significant difference in the organoleptic properties of the
      cheeses. The authors suggested that use of CO2-treated milk would
      not have detrimental effects on cheese properties or yield and
      would extend the keeping quality of the raw milk.<br>
      <br>
      In a later study, Ruas-Madiedo and others (2002) examined the
      effect of CO2 addition to raw milk on the manufacture of
      rennet-coagulated Spanish hard cheeses, both made from pasteurized
      milk and aged for 30 d and from a 90:10 mixture of raw milk from
      cows and ewes and aged 75 d. CO2 was removed from raw milk prior
      to pasteurization and/or the cheese-making process. Compared to
      cheese made with pasteurized milk, CO2-treated milk showed slower
      initial growth of lactic acid bacteria with lower levels of acids.
      Compared to cheeses made from unpasteurized milk, both CO2-treated
      cheeses exhibited no change in volatile compound production, a
      reduction in clotting time, a higher cheese yield, and an increase
      in cheese hardness. In a later study (Ruas-Madiedo and others
      2003) the group extended this work by examining the effects of the
      treatments on proteolysis. Cheeses made from CO2-treated milk
      exhibited lower amounts of hydrophilic peptides and no change in
      hydrophobic peptides at the end of ripening. β-casein breakdown
      was not affected while αs1-casein breakdown was enhanced during
      aging; no difference in taste was detected, as measured by a
      sensory panel.<br>
      <br>
      Nelson and others (2004a, 2004b) similarly found no change in
      β-casein breakdown and an increase in α-casein breakdown during
      the aging of cheese made with CO2-treated milk. In this study,
      however, milk was preacidified with 35 mM CO2, which was not
      removed prior to cheese making. A significant reduction in make
      time was observed compared to the control milk cheese. Cheese
      manufactured from CO2-acidified milk had less total fat and
      calcium than the control cheese, and higher total salts, while
      total crude protein did not change. During aging, the use of
      starter and coagulant cultures was the same for both treated and
      untreated milks; however, proteolysis was found to be higher in
      the CO2 treated cheese.<br>
      <br>
      Ultrafiltration (UF) and microfiltration (MF) of raw milk to allow
      separation and concentration of milk components can produce a
      concentrated milk with optimized protein content; such modified
      milk can be used in cheesemaking. Ma and Barbano (2003b) examined
      the effect of protein concentration and type in CO2-treated UF and
      MF milks on freezing point and pH, and found that increasing
      either casein or soluble protein increased the buffering capacity
      of milk. At low CO2 injection temperatures, where the amount
      dissolved in the milk skim portion is maximized (Ma and Barbano
      2003a), pH reduction was influenced by the protein concentration
      and type. Work by Gevaudan and others (1996) with skim milk
      modified with moderate pressures of CO2 showed that the buffering
      capacity of the milk shifted to a slightly lower range, which was
      thought to be due to an irreversible increase in milk salts; pH
      change, however, was reversible. Thus, if a specific CO2 level in
      the milk is desired, pH cannot be used as an estimate of CO2
      levels; direct measurement of CO2 content should be performed for
      more accurate analysis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cottage cheese</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The use of CO2 has been found to be commercially beneficial in the
      preservation of cottage cheese. Creamed cottage cheese sealed in
      flexible containers following CO2 flushing and storage at 4 °C
      showed repressed growth of psychrotrophs, yeast, and molds
      (Kosikowski and Brown 1973). Fresh flavor was maintained for 73 d,
      but due to the high level of CO2 the cottage cheese had a “fizzy”
      character. Other laboratories have subsequently investigated gas
      flushing of the headspace for the preservation of cottage cheese
      (Rosenthal and others 1991; Moir and others 1993; Fedio and others
      1994). Maniar and others (1994) reported that gas flushing with
      100% CO2 was preferred over other gas mixtures for maintaining the
      microbiological and sensory quality.<br>
      <br>
      Gas flushing is reportedly used commercially in Germany (Honer
      1987). Cups are flushed with CO2 before filling with cottage
      cheese and at the end of the filling the headspace is again
      flushed with CO2. The tubs are sealed with aluminum foil and
      capped.<br>
      <br>
      Moir and others (1993) suggested that addition of CO2 throughout
      the cheese before packaging was necessary to inhibit psychrotrophs
      both on the surface and within the depth of the cheese. They
      reported a significant difference in the microbial counts between
      the surface and the interior of cottage cheese packaged in
      conventional, thermoformed, high-impact polystyrene cups. CO2
      concentrations were found to have decreased throughout the storage
      period, as the CO2 permeability of the containers was high.<br>
      <br>
      Many of the problems associated with CO2 in cottage cheese have
      been overcome by the direct addition of CO2 into the cream
      dressing prior to mixing with the curd to form cream-style cottage
      cheese (Chen and Hotchkiss 1991a, 1991b, 1993). The quality of
      CO2-containing cottage cheese packaged in polystyrene tubs
      overwrapped with a high-barrier heat-shrinkable film can be
      maintained for 63 and 42 d at 4 °C and 7 °C, respectively (Chen
      and Hotchkiss 1991b).<br>
      <br>
      The commercial procedure for manufacturing cottage cheese with a
      low level of CO2 involves injecting CO2 into the cream dressing
      via an in-line sparging unit designed for food applications. CO2
      gas is injected into the moving stream of cream dressing at a
      controlled rate in a pressurized line. The treated dressing is
      mixed with the curd and filled into containers. Several parameters
      should be controlled, including the size of the CO2 bubbles,
      backpressure within the line, residence time in the line,
      temperature, and the filling process (Hotchkiss and Lee 1996).<br>
      <br>
      The question of the “taste” (or more precisely, mouth feel) of CO2
      in cottage cheese and other products is often raised. The amount
      of CO2 used is often below that which is capable of producing the
      common tactile sensation associated with CO2-containing beverages
      or sodas. Using trained sensory panelists in triangle tests we
      have found that the lowest threshold for CO2 in milk is between
      4.54 and 9.10 mM (Chen and others 1992; Lee 1996). The flavor
      threshold for untrained “consumer” panels is likely to be higher.
      Moir and others (1993) found that 10 mM CO2 injected into cottage
      cheese cream dressing and package headspace could significantly
      increase shelf life while not affecting pH or flavor.<br>
      Yogurt and fermented dairy beverages<br>
      <br>
      Mold and yeast growth and development of off-flavors can be a
      major determinant of shelf life of yogurts (Robinson and others
      2002; Viljoen and others 2003). In addition, the survival of
      probiotic organisms is of importance in some yogurt products.
      Technologies that extend shelf life must therefore take into
      account the effect on both spoilage and desirable organisms in the
      product. As with cottage cheese, headspace flushing of yogurt
      packages with CO2 can extend shelf life by inhibiting spoilage
      organisms (Tamime and Deeth 1980), and it is possible that direct
      incorporation of CO2 into the product may also beneficially impact
      shelf life. A method whereby spoonable yogurt could be carbonated
      has been patented and modifications of a more optimized method and
      model for carbonation of viscous fluids have been published
      (Taylor and Ogden 2002). As with production of CO2-injected
      cottage cheese, the economic investment in equipment and supplies
      is minimal, with packaging costs the most significant expense.
      Karagul-Yuceer and others (2001) recently reported that high
      levels (1.1 to 1.2 volumes) of dissolved CO2 incorporated into
      yogurt had little effect on desirable (typical or nontypical
      starter cultures) or undesirable (spoilage and pathogenic)
      microorganisms. It had been hypothesized that the addition of CO2
      to the product could feasibly stimulate growth of starter
      bacteria, reducing production time. The growth of only 3 different
      spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, E. coli, L. monocytogenes,
      and B. licheniformis, was monitored. L. monocytogenes was not
      affected by dissolved CO2 and populations slowly declined in both
      CO2-treated and -untreated product during storage. Populations of
      E. coli decreased to nondetectable levels in the CO2-treated
      yogurt during 60 d storage, while B. licheniformis was reported
      not to grow under any conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In an earlier study, Karagul-Yuceer and others (1999) showed no
      differences in shelf life sensory properties or consumer
      acceptance between CO2-modified and nonmodified yogurts. Wright
      and others (2003) determined that the sensory carbonation
      threshold in yogurt is on average 5.97 mM, at considerably lower
      levels than those tested in the previous study. The threshold
      could be used by manufacturers to develop carbonated yogurt
      products or to make CO2 amendments to yogurt to extend shelf life
      without changing sensory properties.<br>
      <br>
      As previously discussed, raw milk modified with CO2 during storage
      prior to dairy product manufacture can result in improved
      microbial quality with no noticeable changes to the finished
      product characteristics. Calvo and others (1999) reported that
      yogurt made from CO2-amended skim milk was not significantly
      different, including lactic acid production, from control yogurts
      made from nontreated milk. They concluded that the addition of CO2
      to raw milk destined for yogurt production would be feasible.
      Gueimonde and others (2003) also found no difference in the
      evolution of organic acids between yogurts made with CO2-treated
      and -untreated milk. These authors also found no difference in
      sensory properties and in the growth of starter cultures used.
      Neither study, however, reported the levels of CO2 applied.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon dioxide-modified raw milk has also been evaluated for its
      use in the manufacture of fermented milk beverages. Vinderola and
      others (2000) found that CO2 modification decreased milk
      fermentation time in both Streptococcus thermophilus/Lactobacillus
      acidophilus (AT) and S. thermophilus/ L.
      acidophilus/Bifidobacterium bifidum (ABT)-fermented milk products;
      no negative impact on sensory characteristics of the milks was
      noted. Similarly, Gueimonde and de los Reyes-Gavilan (2004) found
      shortened incubation times in carbonated fermented milks using a
      variety of L. acidophilus and S. thermophilus starter strains.
      Noriega and others (2003) later examined B. cereus-inoculated ABT
      milk, finding significant inhibition of growth of the pathogen in
      CO2-modified milk during incubation at 37 °C. During storage at 4
      °C, proteolysis and acid production were reduced in inoculated
      milk. The authors conclude that CO2 can be an effective method of
      reducing the risk of B. cereus contamination in ABT milk during
      the required prolonged incubation period. In both studies, no
      impact on the growth of the probiotic Bifidobacterium was noted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Butter</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Addition of CO2 to butter during the churning stage has been
      investigated (Hunziker 1924; Prucha and others 1925). The gas was
      allowed to flow into the cream during the entire churning
      operation. No pronounced effect on microbial growth was observed.
      The “sourish” taste (undoubtedly due to residual CO2 levels that
      were above the taste threshold) of the butter immediately after
      carbonation disappeared during storage. This latter phenomenon
      suggests that the CO2 level was not maintained within the butter
      sufficiently to have an inhibitory effect. Prucha and others
      (1925) observed that bacterial growth was suppressed only when
      carbonated butter was packaged in airtight vessels. It is unclear
      why, in these studies, CO2 did not remain dissolved in the butter;
      it is generally recognized that CO2 is highly soluble in nonpolar
      lipids (Fogg and Gerrard 1991). However, the injection
      temperatures used may have influenced overall solubility. In a
      study of the effect of CO2 injection temperature on CO2 solubility
      in milk and cream, Ma and Barbano (2003a) found that at higher
      temperatures where milk fat is liquid, CO2 solubility in the fat
      increased; at temperatures where milk fat was in a solid phase,
      CO2 solubility decreased. To the best of our knowledge, more
      recent work on CO2 in butter has not been reported.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Dry milk powders</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dry milk powders packaged in cans or drums for long-term storage
      are commonly commercially packaged in modifed atmospheres,
      including mixed CO2 and N2, 100% N2, or reduced O2 atmospheres.
      Packaging strategies for dry milk powders seek to improve shelf
      life through elimination or reduction of O2 to prevent or slow fat
      oxidation that can cause undesirable off-flavors and odors,
      particularly in whole-fat milk powders. Gas flushing as well as
      insertion of oxygen absorbers can be used to achieve the desired
      in-package storage atmosphere. In an early study by Driscoll and
      others (1985), the sensory quality of instant and regular nonfat
      dry milk after 4 years of storage in cans or polybags at 10, 21,
      and 32 °C and modified atmospheres (air, 100% CO2, 100% N2) was
      measured. At 21 °C, milk stored in cans or in polybags under air
      was less desirable in sensory qualities (off-flavors) than milk
      stored under either N2 or CO2 at the same temperature. The 100%
      CO2 atmosphere was created by addition of a pellet of dry ice to
      the package, which was allowed to sublime. Holm and others (1927)
      found that dry whole milk stored under air or vacuum developed
      off-flavors and odors sooner than milk stored in CO2. Neither
      group reported the effect of high CO2 and O2-depleted storage
      environments on pathogens or spoilage organisms. Quality
      variations in dry milk powder stored in cans with modified
      atmospheres can occur, particularly over very long-term storage. A
      survey by Lloyd and others (2004) of 10 brands of nonfat dry milk
      stored in No. 10 cans obtained from 7 different manufacturers
      within a broad distribution area showed wide variability in
      headspace oxygen content, water activity, and sensory ratings
      (aroma, flavor, and overall acceptance) as well as package
      integrity. This variability was attributed to differences in
      packaging and manufacturing processes occurring between
      manufacturers and inconsistencies in initial quality control
      measures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary and Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The relatively short shelf life and rapid loss of quality coupled
      with the desire to consolidate manufacturing in larger plants has
      necessitated the requirement of an increased shelf life for many
      dairy products. Thermal processes such as ultra-high temperature
      (UHT) and pasteurization of cottage cheese have been developed to
      meet this need; however, in many cases these processes alter the
      organoleptic properties of the products. Use of antimicrobial
      agents such as sorbic acid and nisin has been adopted but there
      are concerns over labeling these additives. The direct addition of
      CO2 to dairy products coupled with increasing the barrier
      properties of the containers has been commercially successful and
      economically feasible with cottage cheese and other fluid
      products. Shelf life extensions of 200% to 400% have been
      achieved. Substantial research exists to show that direct addition
      of CO2 to raw bulk milk during storage prior to processing or
      further manufacturing of different dairy products can
      significantly improve and extend the shelf life of the products,
      increase product safety, and in some cases improve product
      quality. Additionally, increases in shelf life can enable longer
      distance transport of fluid raw milk than what is currently
      achievable, leading to the opening up of new markets. Milk
      intended for consumption as a pasteurized fluid product would
      require that the CO2 be reduced to a level that was similar to the
      levels found in untreated raw milk; vacuum treatment is one
      available technology to achieve this reduction. Additional
      research can increase the efficiency of the process and contribute
      to a better understanding of the fundamental basis of the
      biostatic action of CO2.<br>

            sales</b><br>
        </big></div>
      <br>
      March 20, 2001 -- Taking direct aim at the youth sports drink and
      carbonated soft-drink industry, food science researchers at
      Cornell University have developed a carbonated, milk-based
      beverage. It is anticipated that e-Moo, made by Mac Farms, Inc. of
      Burlington, MA, will be in supermarket dairy cases within months.<br>
      <br>
      "The carbonation does the same thing in soft drinks as in e-Moo.
      It provides a carbonated sensation. Also, it extends the shelf
      life of what you would expect from milk," says Joseph Hotchkiss,
      Cornell professor of food science and one of the researchers who
      worked with Mac Farms on the product's development. "With
      refrigeration, we believe that e-Moo can last six weeks."<br>
      <br>
      But unlike carbonated soft drinks, supercharged with sugar,
      flavoring, and little - if any - nutrition, e-Moo is good for
      children. "The time might be right for e-Moo," says Hotchkiss.
      "The nutrition base is right. If you are 5 or 6 years old, you
      might like this. It has the nutrition profile of milk and could be
      made better than milk."<br>
      <br>
      The fluid idea of the e-Moo beverage began when George and Mary
      Ann Clark of Mac Farms noticed children, teens and young adults
      drinking large amounts of sports beverages and soft drinks. "At
      the same time, we also noticed that sales growth in the fluid
      dairy industry was flat. There had been no recent technical
      innovations that were of any direct benefit to the consumer," says
      Mary Ann Clark, vice president of marketing at Mac Farms.<br>
      <br>
      Mac Farms turned to Cornell's food science expertise to produce a
      formula and to provide data on product stability, nutritional
      efficacy and the modifications to standard milk processing
      equipment for production. "They wanted folks with experience ? and
      we helped turn this concept into a product," says Hotchkiss, who
      has been working with the company and Eric Hallstead, manager of
      the Cornell food science department's pilot plant, for about a
      year.<br>
      <br>
      St. Albans Cooperative Creamery, Inc. of St. Albans, VT, a
      consortium of over 600 dairy farmers from Vermont, New York, New
      Hampshire and Massachusetts, provided the initial funding for the
      development of e-Moo. In addition to the carbonation, Cornell and
      Mac Farms tested a variety of flavors to add to the product.
      Initially e-Moo will come to the market in three flavors: Orange
      Cremecicle, Cookies and Cream, and Fudge Brownie. The product
      contains all the nutrition of nonfat milk with added calcium and
      only half the sodium found in other flavored milks. Named for the
      Internet world that children live in, e-Moo is sweetened with
      fructose instead of refined sugar.<br>
      <br>
      Says Hotchkiss: "If there is a salvation for the fluid milk
      business, which has been on an economic downslide, it is making a
      beverage with milk components. And this could be one successful
      product." <br>

      <br>
      MILFORD, N.Y. (AP) — Adding bubbles to milk is tricky. Pump in too
      many, and it foams over. Add too few and why bother.<br>
      <br>
      George and Mary Ann Clark, husband-and-wife entrepreneurs, have
      spent the past seven years trying to find the balance. Last week,
      they started production on a carbonated milk-based drink called
      Refreshing Power Milk — RPM — and they already have orders coming
      in from school districts.<br>
      <br>
      Mary Ann Clark, a registered nurse, said she was pained to see
      children drinking cola and shunning milk when she worked in
      schools so she decided to do something about it.<br>
      <br>
      "If you take water and add carbon dioxide to make soda, why can't
      you do that with milk?" she asked.<br>
      <br>
      She and her biochemist husband started work on a carbonated milk
      drink in 1996 and founded Mac Farms Inc. in 1998.<br>
      <br>
      The company already sells eMoo, another carbonated milk drink. On
      Wednesday, in a factory with a barn-red roof and purple-and-yellow
      cow out front, the first batch of RPM was bottled.<br>
      <br>
      The Clarks combined water and powdered milk to create slightly
      fizzy, mildly milky-tasting drink with the nutritional value of
      skim milk and 40 percent of the recommended daily amount of
      calcium.<br>
      <br>
      Each 12-ounce serving contains 90 calories and 12 grams of sugar,
      compared to 150 calories and 40 grams of sugar in a 12-ounce can
      of Coca-Cola. RPM contains 9 grams of protein compared to none in
      a can of Coca-Cola, but is higher in sodium: 115 grams to 52 grams
      per 12-ounce serving.<br>
      <br>
      The flavors: vanilla cappuccino, Brazilian chocolate and chocolate
      raspberry.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers at Cornell University had been looking for ways to
      extend the shelf life of dairy products using carbonation when the
      researched teamed up with the Clarks several years ago.<br>
      <br>
      Joe Hotchkiss, chairman of the Department of Food Science at
      Cornell University, said the drink was designed to attract people
      who like soda.<br>
      <br>
      "People consume food based on their sensory properties, taste,
      what kind of emotional feelings it gives them," said Hotchkiss.
      "Our role is to provide that similar kind of satisfaction in
      foods, but also couple that to foods that are more nutritionally
      sound."<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The effect of the application of CO2 to extend the cold storage of
      raw and pasteurized milk on the content of fat-soluble vitamins of
      milk was investigated. CO2-treated milk (pH 6.2) was compared with
      a control (unacidified) milk. CO2-treated and control raw milk
      samples were stored at 4 °C for 4 days. CO2-treated milk was then
      vacuum degasified, and both control and treated samples were
      pasteurized and stored at 4 °C for 7 days. CO2 addition inhibited
      the growth of microorganisms in raw milk without affecting the
      stability of vitamin A (retinol and β-carotene) and vitamin E
      (α-tocopherol). Acidity and pH data indicated that subsequent
      vacuum degasification and pasteurization on a pilot scale
      partially removed CO2, making milk acceptable for liquid
      consumption. However, the residual CO2 present extended the
      cold-storage period of pasteurized milk by inhibiting bacterial
      survivors without detrimental effects on retinol, β-carotene, and
      α-tocopherol. Slightly higher (not statistically significant, p
      &gt; 0.05) concentrations of retinol, β-carotene, and α-tocopherol
      were detected during cold storage in raw and pasteurized
      CO2-treated milk with respect to the control milk, which could be
      related to a certain protective effect of the CO2. <br>

      Carbon dioxide is dissolved in liquid dairy products loaded and
      transported in bulk containers so as to improve product shelf
      life, thereby providing options for more economical shipment, as
      by rail and ocean vessels and for extended transport by truck and
      to facilitate extended storage of perishable products and to avoid
      the necessity of multiple treatments for pathogen
      reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present application is a continuation of U.S. Ser. No.
      11/134,831 filed May 23, 2005 and claiming priority to the May 21,
      2004 filing date of U.S. provisional patent application, Ser. No.
      60/573,072.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to techniques to extend the
      shelf life and facilitate the bulk transport of perishable organic
      liquids whereby the liquids are mixed with carbon dioxide gas and
      held under carbon dioxide pressure, in order to extend the time
      before the liquid spoils or sustains material undesirable
      biological changes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Assuring the safety of fluid milk, related dairy products,
      and juices while maintaining quality and increasing the shelf life
      of products is a significant challenge for the food industry. Many
      perishable organic liquids, including juices, but especially raw
      milk, serve as suitable growth mediums for microorganisms.
      Benefits in distribution and organic liquid quality could be
      derived from reducing microbial growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The bulk transport of perishable organic liquids generally
      requires at least one of the following: pasteurization or similar
      treatments to reduce, eliminate or control pathogens; rapid
      shipment; and in some cases, refrigeration. Each of these options
      imposes additional cost and or limitations. For instance, shipment
      by truck may be the quickest transport time but still may not be
      sufficiently rapid to reach all markets. Shipment by rail or ocean
      cargo vessel is slower but more economical. Refrigerated shipping
      costs are substantially higher than the cost for shipments not
      requiring refrigeration. Furthermore, refrigeration is not
      effective to adequately restrain the growth of psychrotrophic
      microorganisms capable of activity at temperatures below 7° C.
      over sustained intervals of time. Each process of pasteurization
      or similar pathogen reduction treatment imposes not only expense,
      but may also negatively impact the flavor quality, nutritional
      content, and other sensory characteristics, such as color, of the
      treated organic liquid with a resulting negative market impact.
      Additionally, thermoduric microorganisms that are potential
      pathogens or cause spoilage may survive the pasteurization
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] As a result of these concerns, today when arranging for the
      shipment of fresh milk from the continental United States to
      Hawaii or a Caribbean island without significant dairy herds,
      there are two principal options, namely:<br>
      Milk is pasteurized before bulk shipment and is re-pasteurized
      prior to local packaging for retail sale. The result is a flavor
      not as fresh as with single pasteurization and a higher cost due
      to multiple handling.<br>
      Milk is pasteurized and packaged for retail sale at or near the
      origin and then shipped in refrigerated containers to the
      destination. The result is higher cost and a loss of shelf life at
      retail due to the transit period.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The repeated pasteurization of the first option is also
      particularly undesirable because while most milk borne
      microorganisms are neutralized by pasteurization, their lipolytic
      and proteolytic enzymes can survive and result in undesirable
      lipolysis and proteolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The major strategy to extend shelf life of unpasteurized
      perishable organic liquids has been to provide rapid
      refrigeration. For instance, decreasing the storage temperature
      from 6° C. to 2° C. increases the time for the psychrotrophic
      count to reach 10&lt;6 &gt;cfu (colony forming units)/ml from 2.9
      to 5 days (Griffith, 1987).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Several authors have reported on the use of unpressurized
      carbon dioxide as an anti-microbial agent in foods including dairy
      products. The concept of using CO2 to inhibit the growth of
      unwanted microorganisms in dairy products stems from the
      technology of modified atmosphere packaging. This method of shelf
      life extension has been adapted to fluid dairy products by
      directly injecting the inert gas (CO2) thereby enhancing its
      inhibitory effect. The direct post-pasteurization addition of
      carbon dioxide (DAC) to neutral and acidic pH products can be used
      to control contaminating organisms. DAC is widely used by cottage
      cheese processors in North America. Carbon dioxide has also been
      shown to extend the shelf life of yogurt, to improve the keeping
      quality of raw milk, and to extend the yields of cheese
      subsequently prepared from such milk. However, under specific
      combinations of pressure and temperature, CO2 effectively
      precipitates the proteins from milk. For example, at 38° C. and
      pressures above 5514 kiloPascals (kPa), or about 800 psi, complete
      precipitation of the casein proteins that give milk its
      distinctive white color results. CO2 pressure treatments applied
      at a pressure of only 294 kPa (about 43 psi) at 20° C. may result
      in casein aggregation. Accordingly, pressurization has been
      avoided due to potential deleterious effects upon the treated
      liquids. In addition, and not unrelatedly, there is an absence of
      suitable pressure vessels for pressurized bulk storage and
      transport of organic liquids. The studies utilizing CO2 pressure
      treatments have been principally directed to pathogen reduction
      treatments with high CO2 pressures as an alternative to thermal
      pasteurization. Lower CO2 pressures have not been previously
      utilized as conditions of storage and transportation to reduce
      microbial growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present invention provides a method that extends the
      stability of raw milk and other perishable organic liquids
      sufficiently to permit their transport by rail or cargo ship, or
      by truck for greater distances than is ordinarily accomplished
      today; or shipment by any mode that would benefit the end user by
      being more cost effective or offering more time to handle or
      package the product for human consumption or for other food, feed
      grade, pharmaceutical, or industrial use or extended storage. In
      furtherance of the invention, raw milk or other perishable organic
      liquids are preferably cooled to the greatest extent practical and
      injected with carbon dioxide as they are loaded in food grade
      storage and transport containers that are pressure vessels
      according to applicable pressure vessel codes, so that the filled
      containers can be pressurized with about 20 to 50 psi (138 to 345
      kPa), and more preferably about 30 to 50 psi (207 to 345 kPa), of
      carbon dioxide. Such carbon dioxide head pressure does not result
      in protein precipitation and maintains concentrations of
      sufficient parts per million in the raw milk or other organic
      liquids so as to suppress pathogen growth, at least of the most
      common obligate aerobic varieties, by lowering the ph and by
      initiating deleterious intercellular activity and by surrounding
      the pathogens in what is equivalent to their own output. In such a
      state, the pathogens' animation and reproduction ceases or is
      suitably reduced so as to inhibit their growth and multiplication,
      which would otherwise result in spoiled product.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The pressurized carbon dioxide rich raw milk and other
      perishable organic liquids may then be shipped or stored in the
      container without spoilage for periods of time greater than
      untreated and un-pressurized products, provided the storage tanks
      are sufficiently insulated or refrigerated to prevent excessive
      heating of the contents. Upon delivery, or when the milk or other
      organic liquid is needed for production, the container is unloaded
      and the carbon dioxide is released from the liquid by some form of
      agitation, stirring or mixing independent of or in conjunction
      with negative (vacuum) pressure and the liquid is then processed
      in its usual fashion.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present process can effectively extend the life of a
      wide variety of perishable organic liquids including dairy
      products, vegetable juices, fruit juices, plant extracts, fungal
      extracts, flavoring agents, and combinations thereof.<br>

      <br>
      [0033] As is described in this patent, milk injected with carbon
      dioxide and the application of pressurized carbon dioxide in a
      transport vessel retards the growth of pathogens in the raw milk.
      Raw milk has been used as an example in this text not to limit the
      usefulness of the patent but rather to explain the invention with
      reference to one of the more commonly transported liquid products
      that is also one of the more perishable products. The same process
      may be utilized to retard the growth of similar pathogens in other
      perishable organic liquids. Accordingly, the invention may also be
      practiced in connection with liquids such as fruit juices, wine,
      malt beverages, beverage preparations, liquid eggs, feed grade
      bulk liquids as well as pharmaceutical or industrial grade liquids
      and other similar materials susceptible to detrimental

      [0048] CO2 is a ubiquitous environmental bacterial stress. In
      accord with the present invention, purified CO2 may be safely and
      inexpensively utilized at low pressures to improve overall quality
      and safety of dairy products, as well as other liquid products,
      juices, extracts, liquid supplements, and liquid pharmaceuticals.
      The combination of refrigeration below 7° C. and application of
      CO2 pressure may result in a synergistic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] As previously stated, milk and dairy products are generally
      very rich in nutrients that provide an ideal growth environment
      for many microorganisms. A principal class of microorganism that
      may find its way into milk is bacteria. Bacterial growth generally
      proceeds through a series of four phases: (1) a lag phase during
      which time the microorganisms become accustomed to their new
      environment with little or no growth; (2) a log phase during which
      bacterial logarithmic or exponential growth begins; (3) a
      stationary phase where the rate of multiplication slows down due
      to the lack of nutrients and build up of toxins; and (4) a death
      phase in which bacteria numbers decrease as growth stops and
      existing cells die off. In addition, fungi such as yeast and
      molds, as well as bacterial viruses may also be present in milk
      and dairy products. Typically, microbial growth will vary
      according to a number of factors including nutrient content,
      moisture content, pH, available oxygen, and temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The 2003 Revisions of the Grade “A” Pasteurized Milk
      Ordinance promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      establish chemical, physical, bacteriological and temperature
      standards for Grade “A” Raw Milk and Milk Products for
      Pasteurization, Ultra Pasteurization or Aseptic Processing.
      Principal among these are that milk be cooled to 10° C. (50° F.)
      or less within four hours or less of the commencement of the first
      milking and to 7° C. (45° F.) or less within two hours after the
      completion of milking provided that the blend temperature after
      the first milking and subsequent milkings does not exceed 10° C.
      Bacterial limitations provide that the individual producer milk is
      not to exceed 100,000 cfu per mL prior to commingling with other
      producer milk and not to exceed 300,000 mL as commingled milk
      prior to pasteurization. Bacterial counts are performed according
      to the Standard Plate Count (SPC) which determines the number of
      visible cfu's or colony-forming units (numbers of individual or
      tightly associated clumps of bacteria) in 1 mL of milk incubated
      at 32° C. (90° F.) for 48 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Milk is an excellent food source for humans, bacteria, and
      microorganisms alike as it is full of vitamins, fats, minerals,
      nutrients, and carbohydrates. Milk is rich in the protein casein
      which gives milk its characteristic white color, and the most
      abundant carbohydrate is the disaccharide lactose “milk sugar.” At
      room temperature, milk undergoes natural souring caused by lactic
      acid produced from the fermentation of lactose by fermentive
      lactic acid bacteria. Spoilage is a term used to describe the
      deterioration of a food's texture, color, odor, or flavor to the
      point that it is unappetizing or unsuitable for human or animal
      consumption. Microbial spoilage of food often involves the
      degradation of protein, carbohydrates, and fats by microorganisms
      or their enzymes.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Several authors have reported on the use of CO2 as an
      antimicrobial agent in foods including dairy products (Dixon and
      Kell, 1989; Haas et al., 1989). In raw milk, bacterial growth was
      reduced by 50% after addition of CO2 and storage at 6.7° C. for 48
      h (Shipe et al., 1978). King &amp; Mabbitt (1982) demonstrated an
      extension in storage life of both poor and good quality milks by
      the addition of 30 ppm CO2. CO2 is effective in reducing the rate
      of growth of organisms detected in aerobic plate count assays
      (Roberts and Torrey, 1988). Compared to control milk, the SPC of
      milk containing 20-30 pmm dissolved CO2 was 3 log10 cfu/ml lower
      after 4 days of storage at 7° C. (Mabbitt, 1982). In the presence
      of CO2, the time for SPC to reach 7 log10 cfu/ml was extended from
      3 to 9 days at 7° C. and 6 to 11 days at 4° C., whereas in the
      control this level was reached in just 5 days at 7° C. and 8 days
      at 4° C. (Hotchkiss, 1996). Coliforms and psychrotrophs were also
      significantly reduced compared to control milk under the same
      conditions (Roberts and Toney, 1988). Generally, gram-negative
      psychrotrophs are more susceptible to the effects of CO2, whereas
      gram-positive bacteria and spores are more resistant;
      Lactobacillus spp. are relatively CO2 resistant, or their growth
      may be enhanced by a CO2 enriched environment (Hendricks and
      Hotchkiss, 1997). Excessive growth of Lactobacillus spp. in raw
      milk may lead to spoilage or development of off-flavors due to
      fermentation. Treatments that reduce microbial populations may
      result in outgrowth of thermoduric spore-forming bacteria due to
      reduced competition, increasing the likelihood of
      post-pasteurization spoilage or reduced food safety.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The addition of CO2 has been shown to increase the lag
      phase of growth and decrease the growth rate of microorganisms
      (Martin et al., 2003). In CO2-treated milk, extension of the lag
      phase increased the generation times of the Pseudomonas species
      (Roberts and Torrey, 1988). Increasing concentrations of CO2
      increased lag phases and extended growth rates. King and Mabbitt
      (1982) demonstrated an extension in storage life of poor quality
      milk (10&lt;5 &gt;cfu/ml) by 1.2 days and good quality milk
      (10&lt;3 &gt;cfu/ml) by 3 days with the addition of 30 ppm CO2.
      The extension of keeping quality of milk due to CO2 was maximized
      when the initial counts in the milk were low. Low-level
      carbonation of bulk tank milk inhibits the increase in microbiota
      for 3 to 4 days. The reduction in counts would, in turn, reduce
      the thermotolerant lipases and proteases secreted into the milk,
      post-pasteurization (Espie and Madden, 1997).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Several theories explaining the mechanism of CO2 action on
      microorganisms have been proposed. The exclusion of oxygen by
      replacement with CO2 may contribute to the overall effect by
      slowing the growth rate of aerobic bacteria (Daniels et al.,
      1985). CO2 can also readily pass through cell membranes, form
      carbonic acid within the cell with a resultant decrease in
      intracellular pH which slows intracellular enzyme activities
      (Wolfe, 1980). CO2 has been demonstrated to be inhibitory of
      certain enzymes, especially decarboxylating enzymes (Gill and Tan,
      1979). Carbon dioxide can also accumulate in membrane lipid
      bilayers, altering membrane properties and inhibiting membrane
      functions (Enfors and Molin, 1978). The effect of CO2 has been
      found to be enhanced at lower temperatures (Gill and Tan, 1979).
      The increasing solubility of CO2 at lower temperatures increased
      the relative inhibitory effect of CO2 on P. fragi (Enfors and
      Molin, 1981).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] These studies have all addressed the use of CO2 injections
      or atmospheres without subjecting the treated liquid to pressure.
      To some extent this may be due to the paucity of food grade
      pressure bulk storage vessels. However, because the application of
      pressure to milk is known to lead to undesirable biological
      changes, specifically the precipitation of proteins, research has
      taught away from the present invention. When pressure has been
      applied to other perishable liquids, it has typically been at high
      pressures to achieve the substantial elimination of pathogens. The
      maintenance of milk and other bulk perishable liquids under low
      pressures of CO2 at about 138 kPa and 350 kPa for the purposes of
      retarding microbial growth during storage and transport is
      heretofore unknown to the inventers.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] While details of the carbon dioxide treatment according to
      the invention may be slightly varied according to the particular
      organic liquids involved, the invention will be explained below in
      connection with milk collection and processing, which may be best
      understood with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 1 illustrates the movement of raw milk from a large or
      small dairy farm 11,12 to a milk bottling or processing facility
      15. Dairy farms vary in size from a few cows to as many as 12,000
      or more. The farms milk at least twice daily in milking parlors 21
      and the milk is chilled and pumped into on-farm storage tanks 13.
      Milk is picked up by transport tankers 22 at least every other day
      and in the case of large farms 12, multiple times a day. Milk from
      small farms 11 is often taken to consolidation facilities 14 where
      it is tested before commingling with other farms' milk. The
      process of this invention is to station carbon dioxide injection
      systems 16 comprising tanks of liquefied or compressed carbon
      dioxide with the appropriate hoses, regulators, valves, fittings,
      injectors and appurtenances necessary to dissolve the CO2 into the
      milk at the farm 12 or consolidation facility 14 or in some cases
      the carbon dioxide system 16 may be mounted on the transport
      vehicle so as to be mobile and not require separate systems 16 for
      each point of loading.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Once the raw milk is sufficiently infused with carbon
      dioxide for stabilization, the transport tank, a bulk pressure
      transport vessel 17 such as intermodal tank 30 shown in FIG. 3, is
      pressurized to preserve the appropriate concentration of dissolved
      CO2. The tank 30 can be pressurized using the same carbon dioxide
      source as for the infusion by then rerouting the gas through the
      air inlet 33 as shown in FIG. 7. Alternatively, solid carbon
      dioxide, commonly referred to as “dry ice,” can be inserted into
      the liquid through the manway 35 shown in FIG. 3, at amounts
      calculated to create the required pressure when vaporized in the
      sealed tank. This approach also has the added benefit of lowering
      the temperature of the product, further slowing the growth of
      pathogens and enhancing the effectiveness of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The loaded tank 30 is transported to a milk bottling plant
      or processing plant 15 where the milk is agitated 18 to remove the
      carbon dioxide. This may be done in-situ by air injection into the
      transport tank or may be done in a separate agitation tank to
      remove CO2 to acceptable levels or this may involve the use of
      vacuum or negative pressure. The unloading process is otherwise
      essentially the same as with untreated milk except for this step.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The milk is then processed according to its end use 19
      which may be to pasteurize, homogenize, process, condense,
      culture, or perform other customary processes before packaging for
      retail sale or preparing for further transport or sale. Even in
      the event that the milk processing plant 15 is reasonably close to
      the dairy farm 11,12, there may still be a need to extend the life
      of the raw milk. The dairy farm or purchaser of the milk may want
      greater flexibility in processing the milk when supply and demand
      are imbalanced. For instance, rather than diverting excess milk to
      an alternative use, such as milk powder, a lower value product,
      the milk processor may want to retain inventory at or near the
      plant 15 in times of greater supply for use later in times of
      greater demand. This preserves the milk for its highest and best
      use and eliminates unnecessary transportation cost. In the event
      it is desired to transport the raw milk long distances, it is
      necessary today to use relatively expensive express truck delivery
      from farm 12 or consolidation facility 14 to processing plant 15
      as lower cost alternatives are typically too slow. Even with
      express truck delivery, it is generally impractical to transport
      raw milk long distances within the three days desired or
      stipulated by industry or regulatory agencies due to the
      perishable nature of milk. With the greater shelf life of raw milk
      stabilized according to the present invention, raw milk may be
      loaded at a dairy farm with a carbon dioxide mixture and sealed
      with pressurized carbon dioxide and the tank delivered to a rail
      carrier for conveyance anywhere in North America or to an ocean
      carrier for conveyance to much of the world.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 2 shows the process that has been utilized to supply
      milk to Hawaii, a variation of the milk distribution system
      described in FIG. 1. Here, raw milk is collected from farms 11, 12
      by transport tankers 22 and delivered to milk processing
      facilities 15 near the ports 27 in California using traditional
      transport means. At the processing facilities 15, the raw milk is
      pasteurized 23, chilled and pumped into tank containers 24. The
      tank containers are taken to the shipping docks 27 at the port and
      transported by cargo ship to Hawaii. In Hawaii, the tank container
      is discharged from the ship and delivered to another milk
      processing facility 28 which re-pasteurizes 23 the milk prior to
      packaging 25 for retail. Alternatively, packaged milk 25 in
      Southern California may be placed in refrigerated containers 26
      and transported by cargo ship 27 to Hawaii for delivery to the
      customer 29. This alternative eliminates the necessity of
      pasteurizing the milk twice, but incurs the additional expense of
      refrigerated shipment and each prepackaged unit has fewer days
      remaining on its shelf life when delivered to Hawaiian retailers
      than it would if the milk were processed locally. According to the
      present invention, these problems are solved by placing raw milk
      in pressured tank containers 17 with carbon dioxide 16,
      pressurized, and shipped 27 without either pre-pasteurization or
      refrigeration.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] A preferred transportation container for use in practicing
      the invention is a vessel sufficiently large so as to hold maximum
      legal highway weights of product (in the United States roughly
      50,000 pounds) and of a sufficient volume to allow the head space
      to be pressurized. Depending upon the design and tare weight of
      the pressure vessel and upon the specific gravity of the product
      hauled, such a unit is preferably between about 4500 and 6500 U.S.
      gallons in capacity. The container should be food grade or
      sanitary grade depending upon the product hauled, insulated
      against significant temperature gain or loss, built as a pressure
      vessel with a bottom discharge outlet, pressure/vacuum relief
      valve, and an air inlet. To meet pressure vessel codes and be food
      grade, construction of a good grade of stainless steel such as 304
      or 316 is most typical, but manufacture from other metals such as
      titanium or of a composite material such as carbon fiber is also
      possible. The preferred insulating material is a cellular foam,
      and it is desirable that the insulation provide the container with
      an R-value of at least about 27.5 and preferably between about 28
      and 36. A particularly preferred container is a super-insulated
      food grade tank container 30, typified by the 22,000 liter model
      HO4 tank utilized by Agmark Foods, Inc., as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] As shown in FIG. 3, the food grade tank container 30 is
      constructed as a cylindrical pressure vessel 37, mounted within
      frame 31 to enable the container to be shipped by truck, rail or
      ocean. However, suitable tanks may be built for dedicated truck
      use or as railcars in carload service or adapted to other modes of
      transportation including bulk ocean shipments. The tank 30 in FIG.
      3 has a pressure relief valve 32, an air inlet 33, and a bottom
      discharge outlet 34. In addition, a manway 35 is located at the
      top of the tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] A preferred method of loading a transport container 30 as
      shown in FIG. 3 according to the present invention is to pump the
      milk with a food grade pump 40, shown in FIG. 6, the pump 40 being
      either on-farm or truck mounted, from its on-farm storage
      container 13 or by air pressure applied to the on-farm tank 13 (if
      it is a pressure vessel) or by vacuum applied to the tank
      container 13, if so designed. The milk will flow through the hoses
      41 from the storage tank 13 to an inlet of the transport container
      30, generally the bottom discharge assembly 34 shown in FIG. 3. If
      the product has not already been treated with carbon dioxide, the
      carbon dioxide will be dissolved into the milk 49 by use of a
      sparge or fritted nozzle 48, as illustrated in FIG. 4. The nozzle
      breaks the gas into microscopic bubbles that are easily dissolved
      into the liquid while the liquid is under some amount of back
      pressure between the storage tank 13 and the transport tank 17.
      The amount of carbon dioxide applied is regulated by traditional
      gas regulators 46 between the carbon dioxide source 45 and the
      fritted nozzle 48 so that the absorption is achieved at the rate
      appropriate for the liquid involved. For milk, a CO2 concentration
      of between about 200 and 2000 parts per million is desired,
      although levels at 2400 ppm may be realized with satisfactory
      results.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Unloading is accomplished by attaching a hose or stainless
      steel pipe to the discharge valve 34 of the tank container 30, and
      to a pump 40. The pump empties the contents of the transport tank
      30 through the hose 41 into a plant 15 storage tank for use in the
      plant's system. According to this invention, it is also possible
      to unload milk or other organic liquids without use of a pump.
      This is accomplished by attaching a compressed purified air system
      such as from triple filtered system 50 in FIG. 8 to the air inlet
      33 on the tank 30 and using both the original CO2 pressure and
      purified air to push the product out of the tank. In the case of
      milk, it is widely understood that pumping is both necessary and
      undesirable; necessary in that current milk transport equipment
      does not accommodate pressure and undesirable in that pumping has
      a tendency to shear fat molecules in a way that can encourage
      rancidity. The invention facilitates a completely new set of
      business practices that can dramatically improve the quality,
      price, and service associated with moving perishable organic
      liquids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      [0066] The first example is a laboratory scale experiment to
      investigate the effect on raw milk spoilage and pathogenic
      microbia of holding raw milk under positive CO2 pressures that do
      not result in precipitation of milk solids. Changes in total
      Lactobacillus spp., lactose fermenting and non-lactose fermenting
      gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli, thermoduric bacteria and
      SPC were examined as indicia of potential milk quality and safety.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Test System Design</b><br>
      <br>
      [0067] The apparatus for pressurizing and holding raw milk samples
      is shown in schematic form in FIG. 9 and consisted of two 13-ml
      stainless steel 1.27-cm OD cylindrical vessels 60, 61; one vessel
      60 was pressurized while the other served as a control 61.
      Compressed and filtered CO2 from a high-pressure tank 62 was used
      (Empire Airgas, Inc, Elmira, N.Y.). The system consisted of
      pressure regulator 63, a fine metering valve 64 (NUPRO Company,
      Willoughby, Ohio), an on-off valve 65 (Circle Seal, Anaheim,
      Calif.) and a check valve 66 (NUPRO Company, Willoughby, Ohio).
      The fine metering valve controlled gas flow such that the time to
      reach desired pressure was less than five seconds. The gas entered
      the vertically positioned treatment vessel 60 from the bottom and
      was thus bubbled through the milk until the set pressure was
      reached. A check valve 66 was placed immediately before the inlet
      to the pressure vessel to prevent the backward flow of the fluid
      milk into the gas inlet line. The outlet of the vessels consisted
      of a pressure gauge 67 and a high-pressure release valve 68 (High
      Pressure Equipment, Erie, Pa.). The release valve 68 was kept
      tightly closed during treatment. The control vessel 61 was closed
      off from both ends but not connected to the carbon dioxide line
      inlet and outlet lines.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The apparatus was cleaned and sanitized before and after
      each treatment as follows: water rinse, Conquest sodium hydroxide
      (Ecolab Inc., St. Paul Minn.) soak (20 min, 23° C.), warm tap
      water rinse (50° C.), Monarch CIP phosphoric acid bath immersion
      (Ecolab Inc., St. Paul, Minn.) (20 minute, 23° C.), warm tap water
      rinse (50° C.); Tricholoro-o-cide XP (Ecolab Inc, St. Paul Minn.)
      soak (30 min, 23° C.), sterile water (50° C.) rinse (3×). This
      protocol was validated by testing swab samples of critical control
      points in the dismantled apparatus for microbial load, and testing
      equipment rinse water pH and residual chlorine content (Hach
      Company, Loveland, Colo.). Temperature was controlled by a
      circulating water bath 70 (VWR 1145 Refrigerated Temperature
      Constant Circulator), which circulated hot/cold water through
      copper coils 71, immersed into water in a vacuum dewar flask that
      held the treatment and control vessels. Copper-Constantan
      thermocouples 72 measured the temperature of the treatment and
      control vessels, and were continuously logged onto a temperature
      recorder 73 (Omega Engineering Inc, Stamford, Conn.).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Milk Samples and Treatments</b><br>
      <br>
      [0069] Whole, unhomogenized, raw milk was obtained from two
      sources. Commingled milk samples were obtained from the Northeast
      Dairy Herd Improvement Association, Inc. (Ithaca, N.Y.), a dairy
      analytical consulting laboratory. These samples were commingled
      bulk milks from 236 farms from New York, Pennsylvania, and New
      Jersey and thus, could be considered representative of a wide
      range of milk flora. Milk was also obtained from the Cornell
      University Teaching and Research Center bovine herd (T&amp;R
      Center; Dryden, N.Y.). All milk was stored at 6° C. until use. Raw
      milk from the T&amp;R Center was received in less than 12 hours
      after milking in sterile bottles and held on ice until it could be
      moved to a 6° C. cooler.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Milk samples were mixed and 5 ml of milk added into the
      treatment and control vessels. The treatment vessel was connected
      to the apparatus and the control vessel closed off. Both vessels
      were placed in the water bath. When the desired temperatures were
      attained in both treatment and control vessels, CO2 was introduced
      through the bottom of the treatment vessel until the set pressure
      was reached. The CO2 pressure was maintained throughout the test
      period. When the desired time was reached, the CO2 inlet was
      turned off, the pressure release valve on the outlet line opened,
      and the pressure released in under one minute. After
      depressurization, the treatment and control vessels were removed
      from the water bath and their external surfaces were wiped dry,
      sanitized with 95% ethanol, detached from the apparatus and
      transferred into sterile containers for dilution and plating.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The effect of CO2 pressures and temperature combinations on
      protein precipitation was measured at CO2 pressures of 344, 689,
      1378, 2067, 2757, and 3446 kPa at 20, 10, and 5° C. for 5, 15, 30
      and 60 min. The amount of protein precipitation was quantified and
      expressed as percentage precipitated solids by the method of
      Tomasula (1995).<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Short (&lt;1 h) and longer term (1, 4 and 9 day)
      experiments were conducted. Raw milk (Northeast Dairy Herd
      Improvement Association, Inc.; Ithaca, N.Y.) in 5 ml aliquots was
      treated at each of the following combinations of CO2 pressure,
      temperature, and time (kPa/° C./min): 1378/5/15, 2757/5/5,
      3446/5/5. In longer term studies, raw milk from the T&amp;R Center
      was first stored at 6° C./48 h so that the SPC were at detectable
      levels at treatment initiation. Five ml of milk were treated with
      CO2 pressures of 0 (control), 68, 172, 344, 516 and 689 kPa for 1
      to 9 days at 4.1 to 10° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Raw milk from the T&amp;R Center was monitored for changes
      in aerobic bacteria, gram-negative bacteria and total
      Lactobacillus spp. as follows: CO2 pressures of 0 (control), 68,
      172, 344, 516 and 689 kPa, at 6.1° C. for 4-days. SPC,
      gram-negative bacteria and total Lactobacillus spp. were
      enumerated before (day 0) and after (day 4) treatment. Gram
      negative bacteria were enumerated on MacConkey Agar (Difco Manual,
      Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., Sparks, Md.), a selective and
      differential media which can be used to discriminate between
      lactose fermenting and non-lactose fermenting gram-negative
      bacteria. Use of this media allows a one-step method of obtaining
      estimates of both coliform and non-coliform gram negative
      bacteria. Coliform bacteria may include species of Escherichia,
      Klebsiella and Enterobacter, potential pathogens and/or spoilage
      organisms. Non-coliform gram negative bacteria may include
      spoilage organisms such as pseudomonads or potential pathogens
      such as Salmonella spp. or Shigella spp. Numbers of Lactobacillus
      spp. populations were estimated using acidified (adjusted to pH
      5.5 with glacial acetic acid) Lactobacillus MRS agar (Difco
      Manual, Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., Sparks, Md.) after incubation
      under anaerobic conditions; suspect colonies were confirmed by
      gram stain.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The time to reach an SPC of 2×10&lt;5 &gt;cfu/ml was
      determined using raw milk (T&amp;R Center) without a 2-day storage
      time. Equal volumes were transferred into treatment and control
      vessels and held at 0 and 689 kPa CO2 and 4.1° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The progression of these counts (total, Coliform/E.coli and
      thermoduric bacteria) in the treatment and control samples was
      tracked by conducting checks on the total aerobic counts (SPC) on
      treatment days 4 and 6. Based on the levels of total counts on
      days 4 and 6, analyses of total coli forms/E.coli and thermoduric
      bacteria after day 6 were conducted either in 1-day or 2-day
      intervals. The control sample final count was measured on days 4
      and 6.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Microbiological Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0076] For all microbiological assays, milk sample aliquots of 1
      ml were used in dilution series. Standard Plate Counts (SPC) were
      performed by the method described in Standard Methods for the
      Examination of Dairy Products (Houghtby et al., 1992).
      Gram-negative bacteria were enumerated on MacConkey agar (Difco
      Manual, Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., Sparks, Md.) after spread
      plating and incubation at 30° C. for 48 h. This selective,
      differential media was used to estimate total lactose fermenting,
      non-lactose fermenting and total gram negative bacteria.
      Lactobacillus spp. were estimated by pour plating in acidified
      Lactobacillus MRS agar (Difco Manual, Becton Dickinson &amp; Co.,
      Sparks, Md.), incubated at 32° C. for 48 hours under anaerobic
      conditions. Representative and distinctive suspect colonies were
      gram stained, and confirmed gram positive bacilli colonies were
      counted as an estimate of total Lactobacillus spp.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Initial total, coliform, and thermoduric counts were each
      determined for control and treated samples. Thermoduric organisms
      were enumerated by the laboratory pasteurization count (LPC)
      method described in the Standard Methods for the Examination of
      Dairy Products (Houghtby et al., 1992). The 3M Petri film count
      plate (3M Microbiology Products, St.Paul, Minn.) was used to
      enumerate total coli forms and Escherichia coli in the raw,
      treated and control milk samples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Statistical Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      [0078] MINITAB Release 13.1 (Minitac Inc, State College, Pa.) was
      used for statistical analyses of the data. Analysis of Variance
      (ANOV A) was used to determine the effect of CO2 pressure, and the
      interaction effects of pressure and temperature.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      [0079] Application of CO2 pressures greater than 1378 kPa (200
      psi) for 15 to 60 min resulted in more than 1% precipitation of
      milk solids at 20° C. (data not shown). Treatment for 30 min at
      2067 kPa (300 psi) resulted in 2.6% (w/w) solids which approached
      the maximum (2.8%) found by sulfuric acid precipitation
      (Southward, 1986); However, lowering the holding temperature
      reduced the amount of precipitation; at 5° C. and pressures of
      less than 2067 kPa precipitation could not be detected, even after
      60 min. Treatment combinations of 689 kPa for 60 min, 1378 kPa for
      30 min, 2757 kPa for 5 min and 3446 kPa for 5 min did not cause
      detectable precipitation at 5° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] These results generally agree with previous reports
      including Jordan et al. (1987), Tomasula (1995), and Calvo and
      Bacones (2001), who independently investigated the precipitation
      of caseins from raw skim milk using pressurized CO2. Tomasula
      (1995) found that CO2 pressures between 2757 and 5514 kPa and
      temperatures between 38 and 49° C. caused complete casein
      precipitation. Calvo and Bacones (2001) precipitated 85% of raw
      skim milk caseins by applying CO2 pressures above 1998 kPa for 3 h
      at 40° C. Jordan et al. (1987) obtained 99% precipitation of skim
      milk casein by treatment with 3515 kPa at 50° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Protein precipitation occurs when the pH of the milk has
      been reduced below the isoelectric point of the casein (pH4.6).
      The addition of CO2 to milk leads to the formation of carbonic
      acid and a decrease in pH. In addition, pressurization with CO2
      can cause precipitation of caseins at a pH higher than its
      isoelectric point (Tomasula et al., 1999). Ma and Barbano (2003)
      found that increasing CO2 concentration and pressure decreased the
      pH of skim milk; the pressure effect was greater as CO2
      concentrations increased. These researchers also determined that
      increasing temperature affected the solubility of milk colloidal
      calcium phosphate, resulting in a decrease in milk pH. Jordan et
      al. (1987) found that precipitation of casein occurred between 40
      and 70° C., and that the yield at any specific temperature was
      dependent upon a minimum pressure; this minimum pressure was
      inversely related to temperature. Thus, specific
      pressure/time/temperature treatment combinations must be
      manipulated so that the conditions do not cause precipitation of
      proteins from raw milk.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] All time-pressure combinations significantly reduced the
      SPC of the raw milk compared to untreated controls, even at a low
      pressure and high temperature combination of 68 kPa and 20° C. At
      1378 kPa, the control SPC was 7.89 log10 cfu/ml while the treated
      milk SPC was reduced by 0.33 log10 after 15 min and 0.39 log10
      after 30 min. Twenty-four hour treatments at 20° C. and pressures
      ≧344 kPa resulted in microbial inactivation. The SPC of milk
      treated at 344, 516 and 689 kPa was significantly reduced from
      initial SPC by 0.39, 0.62 and 0.82 log10, respectively, while the
      SPC of the control milks significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased by as
      much as 2.06 log10 cfu/ml. SPC in milk held at 68 and 172 kPa
      significantly increased by 1.07 and 0.59 log10 cfu/ml,
      respectively, however this population increase was significantly
      less than that exhibited by the control milk.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Carbon dioxide pressure treatments of 68 and 172 kPa at 10°
      C. applied over 24 h were more effective at curtailing growth than
      similar pressure-time treatments at 20° C. As found at 20° C.,
      there was a loss in viability at pressures ≧344 kPa and the
      differences between control and test counts increased with
      increasing holding time; significant decreases in counts of 0.31,
      0.56 and 0.71 log10 cfu/ml at 344, 516 and 689 kPa CO2,
      respectively, were achieved. The difference in SPC between control
      and test milks at 689 kPa was 2.68 log10 cfu/ml. These data
      indicate that holding raw milk under CO2 pressure not only slowed
      the growth of the microorganisms in the raw milk but in some cases
      also surprisingly resulted in a loss in viability of the
      microorganisms at relatively low pressure levels of only 344 kPa.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The pH of the treated and control milk samples (as measured
      at atmospheric pressure) was 6.6 to 5.9 at CO2 pressures ≦516 kPa
      and 5.7 when treated at pressures ≧516 kPa and 20° C. The pH of
      the treated and control milk samples, when treated at 10° C., was
      5.5 at CO2 pressures ≦516 kPa and 5.8 when treated at pressures
      ≧516 kPa.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Others have shown inactivation of microbiota in raw and
      pasteurized milk with CO2 at significantly higher pressures
      (Erkman 1997 and 2000; Calvo and Bacones, 2001). Calvo and Bacones
      (2001) found a decrease in bulk raw milk microbiota of 2 log10
      cfu/ml upon treatment with 3997 kPa (or 5800 psi) CO2 at
      temperatures ≧40° C. for 30 min. Erkman (2000) demonstrated a
      reduction in aerobic microorganisms in whole milk of 6 log10
      cfu/ml after a 24 h treatment under 6044 kPa CO2 pressure at 45°
      C. Erkman (1997) also demonstrated a reduction of 8 log10 cfu/ml
      after a 5-h 14598 kPa CO2 treatment at 25° C. However, the use of
      these CO2 pressures would in our experience result in complete
      precipitation of the caseins and would require the use of
      specially designed equipment. Calvo and Bacones (2001) reported
      that pressures of 3997 kPa caused precipitation while Erkman (1997
      and 2000) made no mention of the state of the milk. These high
      pressures, over 3000 kPa, are more appropriate as substitutes for
      thermal pasteurization of liquids that do not suffer from protein
      precipitation, but due to equipment requirements are not generally
      suitable for bulk storage and transportation purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Lowering the holding temperature to 6.1° C. significantly
      reduced microbial growth compared to control milks when CO2
      pressures of 68, 172, 344, 516 and 689 kPa were applied for 4
      days. For example, the SPC of milk held at 689 kPa was 0.89 log10
      cfu/ml lower than initial counts and 3.48 log10 cfu/ml lower than
      the controls. Over the course of 9 days, storage under 689 kPa CO2
      at 4° C., the ratios of treated to untreated SPC, thermoduric,
      coliform, and E. coli counts were consistently lower than the
      ratios of control to untreated counts for the comparable groups
      (cfu/ml) as summarized below in Table 1.<br>

      The effect of 689 kPa CO2 pressure at 4° C. after 4, 6, 8 and
      9-day treatments on the SPC, thermoduric bacteria, coliforms and
      E-coli counts in untreated, treated and control raw milks.
      Experiment conducted in duplicate, n = 2 (2 milk samples
      analyzed), each sample plated in triplicate. Counts with different
      letters are significantly different (P ≦ 0.05).<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Milks treated at 68, 172, 344 and 516 kPa significantly
      increased from an initial SPC of approximately 3.30 log10 cfu/ml
      by 1.28, 1.10, 0.94 and 0.82 log10 cfu/ml, respectively, while the
      control SPC increased by 2.86, 2.85, 2.86 and 2.93 log10 cfu/ml,
      respectively. Milk held at 689 kPa treatment at 6.1° C. for 4 days
      exhibited greater inactivation than that exhibited after the 10 or
      20° C. 24 h treatments (P&lt;0.05). The pH decreased from 6.6
      before treatment to 5.5 in milks treated at 516 kPa, 5.8 at 344
      kPa and 5.9 at 68 kPa.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In addition to SPC, there were significant differences in
      gram-negative lactose fermenting and non-lactose fermenting
      bacteria and Lactobacillus spp. between CO2 treated and control
      milks as shown in FIGS. 10a-10e. In these bar charts, the first
      bar is gram-negative lactose fermenting bacteria, the second
      gram-negative non-lactose fermenting bacteria, the third
      Lactobacillus spp.; and the final bar is SPC. Thus, levels of
      gram-negative fermenters and non-fermenters were reduced at all
      pressures compared to untreated controls. Likewise, Lactobacillus
      spp. counts were approximately 1 to 2 log10 cfu/ml lower in the
      test milks compared to control milk. At 689 kPa, gram-negative
      lactose fermenting and non-lactose fermenting bacteria exhibited
      significant decreases of 0.80 and 0.64 log10 cfu/ml, respectively,
      compared to initial counts. Under 516 kPa CO2 pressure, SPC of
      treated samples were not significantly different from initial
      untreated samples while SPC of control samples increased by 2.95
      log10 cfu/ml Reductions in total microbial populations as well as
      reductions in gram-negative and Lactobacillus spp. populations
      would result in improved quality of the raw milk. Ruas-Madiedo et
      al. (1996) found that lower levels of volatile compounds (ethanol,
      2-propanone, and 2-butanone, which are microbial metabolites) were
      produced in carbonated milk during storage and that higher sensory
      scores were achieved than in untreated milks. In a later study,
      Ruas-Madiedo et al. (2000) found a direct association between
      reduced microbial growth and reduced levels of microbial
      glucosidases in raw milk stored with CO2; degradation of milk
      glucose was subsequently reduced in the treated milks. It has also
      been found that levels of fat-soluble vitamins (retinol,
      -β-carotene and a-tocopherol) in milk treated with CO2 and stored
      at 4° C. for 7 days were higher than that measured for untreated
      raw and pasteurized milks (Ruas-Madiedo et al., 1998a, b).<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In the current study, populations of Lactobacillus
      decreased after CO2 pressure treatment. Others have found that
      treatment with CO2 concentrations between 0 and 2000 mg/l had no
      impact on the lag phase of Lactobacillus sake when grown at 7° C.,
      and influences on the maximum specific growth rate was least
      affected as compared to species of Pseudomonas, Aeromonas,
      Bacillus, Brochothrix and Shewanella (Devlieghere and Debevere,
      2000). Espie and Madden (1997) reported no effect of 30 and 45 ppm
      CO2 on the growth of Lactobacillus spp. Neither of these
      investigations, however, incorporated pressures above atmospheric
      in their treatments. Reductions in populations of Lactobacillus
      plantarum of more than 6 logs was achieved after treatment with
      CO2 pressures of 13 MPa at 30° C. for 30 minutes (Hong and Pyun,
      1999). In subsequent studies, these researchers found that high
      pressure CO2 treatment of L. plantarum resulted in irreversible
      cellular membrane damage and reduced activity of some
      intracellular enzymes, physiological changes that could result in
      microbial inactivation (Hong and Pyun, 2000). Combined or enhanced
      effects of low pressures and CO2 treatments could explain the
      observed reductions in total Lactobacillus populations.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The effect of 689 kPa CO2 at 4° C. on the time to reach an
      SPC of 10&lt;5 &gt;cfu/ml was investigated. Pasteurized Milk
      Ordinance Grade A regulations specifies the SPC for raw milk
      should be less than 10&lt;5 &gt;cfu/ml prior to pasteurization. As
      shown in FIG. 11, where the columns sequentially represent total
      counts, thermoduric bacteria, total coliforms, and E. coli, the
      treated milks reached 10&lt;5 &gt;cfu/ml after 8 days of
      treatment, whereas the control milk reached this level after just
      four days. Treatment at 689 kPa and 4° C. extended the treatment
      holding time at least four days as compared to the control. At the
      end of four days treatment, treated milk SPC had decreased to 2.89
      log10 cfu/ml from 3.48 log10 cfu/ml while control milk SPC
      increased by nearly 5 log10 cfu/ml. This reduction in SPC in
      treated milk agrees with the trend observed in the four-day
      experiments conducted at 6.1° C. (FIG. 10). Milk SPC increased to
      4.64, 4.99 and 5.37 log10 cfu/ml after 6, 8 and 9 days treatment,
      respectively (FIG. 11). Neither E. coli nor total thermoduric
      bacteria counts increased in the treated milk but both
      significantly increased in the controls. The pH of the treated
      milk samples changed from an initial value of 6.6 to 5.5 at the
      end of days 4, 6, 8 and 9 of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0091] This second example was an experiment designed to confirm
      the preliminary results of the first example on a commercial or
      bulk scale.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Test System Design</b><br>
      <br>
      [0092] The apparatus pressurizing and holding raw milk samples
      consisted of a 5300 U.S. gallon (20,000 liter) food grade,
      insulated, pressure vessel shipping container of the model HO4
      type utilized by Agmark Foods, Inc. Compressed and filtered CO2
      from high pressure tank was used, including a Praxair inline 3A
      sparger. The Agmark shipping container was sanitized on Aug. 4,
      2004. The following day, the tank was pre-chilled with a spray of
      CO2 and filled with 3,291 U.S. gallons of fresh raw milk obtained
      from the Cornell University Teaching and Research Center Bovine
      Heard (T&amp;R Center; Dryden, N.Y.) on Aug. 5, 2004. The raw milk
      from the T&amp;R Center was received less than 12 hours after
      milking and was introduced from a holding tank into the pressure
      vessel at a temperature of approximately 1 to 2° C. Prior to
      filling the pressure vessel, the vessel was sealed and pressurized
      with carbon dioxide to a pressure of 25 psi (172.5 kPa). Milk was
      pumped into the tank through the discharge valve at the rear of
      the tank and CO2 was injected into the flow of the milk with an
      inline Praxair 3A sparger at a rate sufficient to infuse
      approximately 2000 parts per million at a gas flow rate of
      approximately 16 cubic feet per minute. The raw milk was pumped
      into the vessel at a flow rate of 70 to 80 gallons per minute with
      flowing CO2 under a 40 psi line pressure and 25 psi tank pressure.
      At the conclusion of loading, the temperature of the milk was at
      2.5° C. with a tank pressure of 43 psi.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Samples were taken daily from 17 consecutive days from both
      the top and bottom of the pressure vessel. A control sample of
      five gallons of untreated milk was held at approximately 2° C. for
      the duration of the study and similarly sampled. Microbiological
      methods consistent with those described in the first example were
      utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The data in Table 2 reflects bacterial growth (SPC log
      cfu/ml), thermoduric count psychrotropic count, E. coli and
      coliform count, pH, and CO2 content, while Table 3 provides

      Comment: Bottom tank sample averaged a daily increase of 0.75
      degree F. while the top tank sample averaged a daily increase of 1
      degree F.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] A microbial quality limit of 5 log cfu/ml SPC was adopted
      from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public
      Health Service and Food and Drug Administration Grade A PMO
      standards for individual producer grade “A” raw milk. As shown in
      FIG. 12a, the total microbial growth did not reach levels of the
      quality limit until day 11 for the control milk and day 12 to 13
      for the top tank milk. Bacterial levels in the bottom of the tank
      did not reach the limit during the entire 17 day study and
      actually decreased from the first day's measurement although the
      temperature had increased to approximately 9° C. (FIG. 12b) The
      low pressure CO2 storage extended the shelf life of the raw milk
      by 4 to 5 days with no added refrigeration or measurable increase
      in food safety risk. Due to the stationary nature of the test,
      milk fat separated and formed a denser layer at the top in which
      most pathogens were concentrated. A natural agitation of raw milk
      product during transit would mitigate this effect. Certain low fat
      products may actually achieve reduced microbial counts over time
      under similar CO2 pressures.<br>

      The present invention provides processes to inhibit or reduce the
      growth of bacteria and other pathogens in a liquid by adding
      carbon dioxide (CO2) to the liquid, and thermally inactivating the
      bacteria and other pathogens in the liquid, wherein the added CO2
      cooperates with the thermal inactivation process so that the
      efficacy of the thermal inactivation process is enhanced.<br>
