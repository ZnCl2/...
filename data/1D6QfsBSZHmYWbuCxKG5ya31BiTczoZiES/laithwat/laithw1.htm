        <p><i>London</i> (AP) ~ A British scientist said yesterday he is
          on the threshold of inventing an antigravity motor that could
          fly a manned spaceship to the stars using nuclear fuel the
          size of a pea. </p>
        <p>Eric Laithwaite, professor of heavy electrical engineering at
          London's Imperial College of Science and Technology, said the
          motor is based on&nbsp; the&nbsp; gyroscope, a rapidly
          spinning top that defies gravity. Gyroscopes already are used
          to guide spaceships. </p>
        <p>"The motor is not easy to explain. If it was, others would
          have tried to produce one by now," said Laithwaite, who
          described himself as an astro engineer. </p>
        <p>Laithwaite began working on the motor about six months ago
          after Edwin Rickman, who works with an electrical&nbsp;
          engineering&nbsp; firm, came to him with the idea. Rickman had
          patented it after he said it came to him in recurring dreams.
          Laithwaite incorporated&nbsp; in&nbsp; the device ideas of
          another amateur inventor, Alex Jones. </p>
        <p>Although Laithwaite is far from the production stage with his
          motor to defy gravity, the 53-year old professor demonstrated
          his principle Friday at the Royal Institution at London. </p>
        <p>Inside a box he brought before his distinguished audience
          were two electrically driven gyroscopes, each placed on a
          central pivot. Laithwaite made the gyroscopes rotate at high
          speed, and they rose into the air on the arms until they
          reached a curved rail that pushed them down again. The process
          then repeated itself. </p>
        <p>With the two gyroscopes motionless, the box weighed 20 pounds
          on an ordinary kitchen scale. With the gyroscopes spinning,
          the contraption weighed 15 pounds. </p>
        <p>Laithwaite said the loss of weight corresponded to the
          gravity loss produced by the&nbsp; spinning&nbsp; gyroscopes.
          Theoretically, the machine could produce weightlessness,
          Laithwaite said. A spaceship with his device could be blasted
          from the earth's gravitational field with conventional rocket
          fuel, Laithewaite said. Then, without friction to hamper the
          anti-gravity engine, nuclear power or solar energy could begin
          operating the gyroscopes and to drive the vehicle to other
          solar systems, he said. </p>
        <p>Laithwaite is the inventor of the electrical linear motor
          capable of propelling a device through strong magnetic
          currents. He said the antigravity motor also could be adapted
          to drive ships and land vehicles silently but added: "Man is
          not interested in traveling horizontally. He always wants to
          go up." </p>
        <p>Laithwaite said the antigravity motor is based on
          electromagnetism and vector multiplication "too complicated to
          explain." </p>
        <p>Then he tried: "Let me put it this way: You take a go-kart
          with no engine and sit in it. It is loaded with a box of lead
          balls. If you throw one ball out behind you,&nbsp; you move
          forward a little. Throw another and you move farther still and
          so on. But if these lead balls were attached to a strong
          elastic band and could be sprung back into the go-kart, you
          would have continuous propulsion. That is what a gyroscope
          does when it moves from one plane to another." </p>

        <p><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
        <p>The present invention relates to a propulsion system for a
          vehicle. It has particular utility in the propulsion and/or
          positioning of space vehicles. </p>
        <p>The majority of propulsion systems in use today rely either
          on exerting forces against the surface over which they travel
          (e.g. cars, trains, funiculars (via their supporting rope)
          etc.), accelerating material which comprises the medium
          through which they travel in a direction opposite to the
          direction in which they are being propelled (e.g. propeller
          aircraft, power driven or manually propelled boats), taking
          advantage of thermally or gravitationally derived energy
          gradients (e.g. sailing boats, gliders or surf boards) or
          ejecting material in the form of fuel carried by the vehicle,
          either in part as in the case of a jet engine or totally as in
          the case of a rocket engine. Hitherto, there has been no
          alternative but to employ the latter method in order to propel
          or position a vehicle in space. </p>
        <p>A problem associated with propulsion systems utilising the
          latter method is that the volatile fuel required to be carried
          by the vehicle represents a danger to any crew in the vehicle,
          the vehicle itself and its contents. </p>
        <p>Another problem associated with such propulsion systems is
          that the range and manoeuverability of the vehicle is limited
          by the amount of fuel carried. </p>
        <p>Yet another problem associated with such systems is that once
          the vehicle is accelerated, it can only be decelerated by
          expending further fuel. </p>
        <p>The invention may also have utility in specialised
          terrestrial applications. For example, much effort has been
          expended in attempting to quieten the propulsion systems of
          boats. By obviating the need for propellers or such like, the
          system according to the present invention may provide quieter
          propulsion than has hitherto been possible. </p>
        <p>The principles underlying the present invention will now be
          explained with reference to and as illustrated in FIGS. 1-9 of
          the accompanying drawings in which: </p>
        <p>One method of moving a space vehicle a short distance is
          illustrated in FIG. 1. A device (D) inside the vehicle is
          arranged to project or move an object (W), of significant mass
          in relation to the mass of the remainder of the vehicle from
          one end of the vehicle to a receptacle (B) at the other end.
          It is known that if the object (W) is so projected to the
          right in FIG. 1, the vehicle will move a distance to the left
          (to the position S) in FIG. 1. After that movement, the object
          (W) and the receptacle (B) are at the positions W' and B'
          respectively. The distance moved will approach the length of
          the vehicle if the mass of the object (W) is relatively large
          in comparison to the mass of the vehicle, or will approach
          zero if the mass of the object (W) is insignificant in
          comparison to the mass of the vehicle. In any case, the effect
          will be that the centre of mass of the vehicle and object will
          not move. For this reason, it is thought that such an activity
          is of little or no use in propelling a vehicle, since it is
          assumed that, in returning the object (W), the vehicle will
          necessarily undergo an equal and opposite displacement to that
          which it underwent when the mass was originally moved from one
          end of the vehicle to the other. </p>
        <p>Another method of moving a vehicle a short distance is
          schematically illustrated in FIG. 2. FIG. 2 shows a vehicle
          (1), on which is mounted a base plate (2), which in turn
          carries a pivot (O). An arm OA of length R is mounted with one
          end on pivot (O) and the opposite end carries an object (W) of
          mass M. </p>
        <p>If a force were to be applied to the object (W) with the
          intention of moving its mass M around the semi-circular arc
          ACB at speed v, it might be thought that the sum of the
          centrifugal force acting on the pivot (O) during that motion
          would have components only in the direction Y and therefore
          that the vehicle would be moved in the direction Y. However,
          this is not the case because the force needed to give the
          initial momentum Mv to the object W will always cancel the
          component of the centrifugal force. In fact, the application
          of the initial force to the object (W) will result in an equal
          and opposite force being applied to the vehicle (1) so that
          the object (W) and the vehicle (1) would rotate in opposite
          senses about the pivot (O). </p>
        <p>The rotary part of this reaction can be neutralized by
          arranging for a second identical object (W1) arranged as a
          mirror image of the first object (W) to rotate in the opposite
          direction as shown in FIG. 3. </p>
        <p>Referring to FIG. 3, if the two objects (W1, W2) are of large
          mass compared to the mass of the vehicle, then it will be seen
          that as they begin to move around their semi-circular paths
          they will exert a relatively large centrifugal force
          (initially towards the right in FIG. 3) on the vehicle (1)
          which will in turn will be accelerated to a relatively high
          velocity by this force owing to its relatively low inertia. As
          the two objects (W1, W2) approach the point B (having passed
          points C and E), they will then exert similarly large
          centrifugal forces to the left in FIG. 3 decelerating the
          vehicle until it returns to the condition it had when the
          objects (W1, W2) were launched. Hence it will be seen that the
          motion of the objects (W1, W2) will be accompanied by an
          associated movement of the vehicle a distance D1 to the right
          as shown in FIG. 4. The vehicle moves from positions A to E in
          that Figure. </p>
        <p>If, however, the objects (W1, W2) have a relatively low mass
          compared to the mass of the vehicle then they will exert a
          relatively small centrifugal force on the vehicle which will
          only be accelerated to a relatively low velocity owing to its
          relatively large inertia. When the masses then approach the
          point B (having passed points C and E), they will exert
          similarly low centrifugal forces on the vehicle in order to
          return it to its initial condition. Therefore, it will be seen
          that if the masses are relatively small (and hence the
          centrifugal force is less than in the previous paragraph), the
          vehicle will have moved a smaller distance D2 to the right.
          The motion of the vehicle in this case is illustrated in FIG.
          5. It will be seen that the reduction of centrifugal force
          results in the vehicle moving a smaller distance. The vehicle
          moves from position A to position E in that Figure. </p>
        <p>Consideration of the above two paragraphs and FIGS. 4 and 5,
          will show that the larger the relative mass of the objects
          (W1, W2) to the mass of the vehicle, the larger the
          displacement of the vehicle will be. If, for example, the
          vehicle were to be of negligible mass when compared to the sum
          of the masses of the objects (W1, W2), then the vehicle would
          move a distance 2R to the right in FIG. 3. If the vehicle were
          to have a mass equal to the sum of the masses of the objects
          (W1, W2), then the effect of the centrifugal force would be to
          move the vehicle a distance R to the right in FIG. 3. </p>
        <p>It will be seen that, in each of the above examples, the
          centre of mass of the combined vehicle and object system
          remains in the same position. </p>
        <p>As stated above, the fact that the centre of the mass of the
          combined system is not moved in each of the above examples
          means that such a method cannot be used to move a vehicle a
          distance greater than its own length. </p>
        <p>However, if the centrifugal force exerted by the masses of
          the objects (W1, W2) as they travelled from position A to
          position B were to be reduced below the level seen in the
          examples above for that mass then the vehicle would be moved
          over a smaller distance. In other words, in a supposed first
          movement (in which centrifugal force is reduced), the vehicle
          would move a first (relatively short) distance in a direction
          opposite to the direction of movement of the masses. </p>
        <p>Then, if the objects (W1, W2) were to be subsequently
          returned, in a second movement in which the centrifugal force
          was equal to that seen in the above examples, the vehicle
          would move a second (relatively long) distance in the opposite
          direction to the first movement. Clearly, after both the first
          and second movements had taken place the position of the
          objects (W1, W2) relative to the vehicle would be unchanged.
          Moreover, it will be seen that the combination of the first
          and second movements would result in a net movement of the
          vehicle and its contents in the direction opposite to said
          first movement. Hence, it will be seen how, if a way could be
          found of reducing the centrifugal force exerted by the objects
          (W1, W2) moving from one end of the vehicle to the other that
          the centre of mass of the combined system could be moved
          across space, that mass could thereby be transferred, and that
          the vehicle could be propelled through space. </p>
        <p>It is well known that when a spinning gyroscope is mounted on
          a pivoted radius arm, so that the pivot is remote from the
          centre of the wheel forming the spinning mass of the
          gyroscope, and the gyroscope is subjected to a torque at right
          angles to the spin axis of the wheel (for instance by means of
          transfer through the radius arm) then the gyroscope precesses,
          that is rotates, about a precession-axis that is at right
          angles both to the spin-axis of the wheel and the applied
          torque provided that it is free to do so. </p>
        <p>FIG. 6 shows a plan view of a spinning wheel, all of whose
          mass may be considered to be concentrated in its rim of
          negligible thickness and of radius r. The wheel is connected
          to a pivot (O) (which forms the centre of precession) by a
          light rod of length R. A torque T is applied to the wheel in
          the direction shown. </p>
        <p>The mechanism of precession may better be understood by
          considering the highest and lowest points of the rim of the
          spinning wheel as illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B. </p>
        <p>From FIGS. 7A and 7B, the application of the torque T may be
          considered as tantamount to the application of a force F1 to
          the top point of the spinning wheel and a force F2 to the
          bottom point of the spinning wheel, deflecting them and
          causing a change in the direction of their velocities from v
          to v' as shown. Thus both velocity vectors are deflected
          clockwise. It will be realized that an object whose velocity
          is constantly changing in a direction at right angles to its
          current velocity moves in a circle. </p>
        <p>By conventional two-dimensional mechanics, a non-precessing
          mass moving in a circle only does so if it is subjected to a
          constantly applied force defined as the `centripetal` force. </p>
        <p>The present inventors realised that by applying oppositely
          directed forces, (the effect of a torque,) to particles that
          are themselves, moving in opposite directions as a result of
          being part of the rim of a spinning wheel they could cause the
          spinning rim to circle about O without requiring a centripetal
          force. </p>
        <p>It is known that a convenient means (for demonstration
          purposes) of applying a constant torque to a gyroscope is to
          offset the gyroscope on a shaft, which is supported at the end
          remote from the gyroscope by a joint, that allows the shaft to
          move both laterally and up and down, and to allow the weight
          of the gyroscope, together with the reaction force at the
          joint, to be the forces that apply the torque. </p>
        <p>It is also known that when the wheel is spun up, suspended
          and released in this manner the gyroscope will precess at a
          rate .OMEGA. derived from the equation: </p>
        <center>
          <p><img src="5860f1.gif" height="66" width="113"></p>
        </center>
        Where: T--MgR--torque at right angles to shaft
        <p>M --- mass of the wheel </p>
        <p>g --- acceleration due to gravity </p>
        <p>R --- length of the shaft </p>
        <p>I --- moment of inertia of wheel </p>
        <p>.omega. --- angular spin velocity of wheel </p>
        <p>Further, it will precess about any point in the precessional
          plane so long as it is launched with initial conditions such
          that it finds itself travelling at the linear tangential
          velocity R..OMEGA. where .OMEGA. is determined from equation
          (1) inserting the value for the torque that so obtains. </p>
        <p>With reference to FIG. 8, the present inventors realised that
          if two gyroscopes of identical mass M and spinning at the same
          speed .omega., but in opposite directions to one another, were
          mounted on equal rods with their remote ends pivoted in a
          frame (0,0') of negligible weight which was itself
          unrestrained, and were launched in an arc from A to B by
          whatever means (P), be it a spring, motor, ramp or chemical
          reaction, in such a way that, at the moment they found
          themselves being acted on by gravity supplying the torque,
          their launch velocity was exactly R..OMEGA. where: </p>
        <center>
          <p><img src="5860f2.gif" height="40" width="78"></p>
        </center>
        <p>then the resulting motion (in the event of the gyroscopes
          being `perfect` (see below)), would not involve a centrifugal
          force being exerted on the frame (0,0'), that the frame would
          not therefore be deflected and that the centre of mass of the
          system would move a total distance of 2R. </p>
        <p>It will be appreciated that if the wheels were not spinning
          and were then just `dead` masses and were given the same
          treatment (as far as that is possible given that they would
          then have NO TENDENCY to move of their own volition when
          subjected to a torque and would therefore have to be projected
          with considerable velocity to achieve a similar result), then
          the frame (0,0') would, (as explained with reference to FIG.
          3), be deflected from a distance R from one side of the wheels
          to a distance R on the other side. The centre of mass of the
          system would not move. </p>
        <p>The present inventors have conducted experiments which show
          that when a gyroscope is caused to precess by a torque
          whatever additional angular momentum it acquires combines with
          the angular momentum already in the spinning mass and if the
          axis about which it is caused to precess is remote from the
          centre of the wheel, that an additional linear momentum
          proportional to the linear tangential velocity of the total
          moving mass of the gyroscope about that said axis of
          precession is the only extra dynamic requirement. The
          experiments conducted further show that, once the gyroscope
          has been launched on its path of precession about a remote
          axis as described, the forces exerted by the gyroscope at that
          axis are largely those involved with application of torque to
          the gyroscope. Such forces that pass through the axis normal
          to the tangent at any point in the precessional path of the
          gyroscope are less than those calculated from the conventional
          formulae for derivation of centrifugal force of a
          non-precessing mass. Thus it follows that, provided it is
          correctly launched, the centre of mass of a gyroscope may be
          moved around a circle of precession from the one end of a
          diameter to the other without the full corresponding net force
          at the centre of precession. </p>
        <p>The present inventors further realised that if the mass of
          the gyroscope could be transferred predominantly by a
          precession of the gyroscope without a substantial movement in
          the vehicle, (i.e. providing the first movement referred to
          above) and thereafter the mass of the gyroscope were to be
          returned to its original position in relation to the vehicle
          by means not involving precession (deriving the momentum for
          that movement from the remainder of the system) (i.e.
          providing the larger second movement referred to above), then
          the vehicle would be moved and if this cycle were to be
          repeated the vehicle would be propelled. </p>
        <p>It is arranged that in the precessional motion of FIG. 8, the
          gyroscopes derive their momentum from each other. </p>
        <p>According to a first aspect of the present invention there is
          provided a method of moving a vehicle in a first direction,
          which method comprises the steps of : connecting at least one
          gyrocope means to said vehicle; causing said gyroscope means
          to follow a path which involves at least one
          precession-dominated portion and at least one
          translation-dominated portion, </p>
        <p>wherein in the precession-dominated portion, the mass of the
          gyroscope means moves in said first direction and an
          associated first movement of the vehicle in substantially the
          opposite direction to said first direction occurs, and, in the
          translation-dominated portion, the mass of the gyroscope means
          moves with an associated second movement of the mass of the
          vehicle in substantially said first direction, wherein said
          second movement is greater than said first movement and hence
          the vehicle moves in said first direction. </p>
        <p>According to a second aspect of the present invention there
          is provided an apparatus for propelling a vehicle in a first
          direction, which apparatus comprises: </p>
        <p>at least one gyroscope means adapted for precessional motion
          about an axis remote from the centre of said gyroscope means;
          means for causing the gyroscope means to follow a path which
          involves at least one precession-dominated portion and at
          least one translation-dominated portion, </p>
        <p>wherein in the precession-dominated portion, the mass of the
          gyroscope means moves in said first direction with an
          associated first movement of the vehicle in substantially the
          opposite direction to said first direction, and, in the
          translation-dominated portion, the mass of the gyroscope means
          is moved with an associated second movement of the vehicle in
          substantially said first direction; and </p>
        <p>wherein said second movement is greater than said first
          movement and hence the vehicle moves in said first direction.
        </p>
        <p>Furthermore, the present inventors have conducted experiments
          which show that if the mass of the wheel of the gyroscope is
          not concentrated at an infinitely thin rim then an amount of
          centripetal force is developed which is required to constrain
          all parts to a circle, or precess, about the same centre 0.
          However, these experiments have verified that the centripetal
          force is still less than that predicted by the conventional
          formula for non-precessing masses. </p>
        <p>The practical situation that would thereby be obtained is
          illustrated in FIG. 9. The gyroscopes would, as a result of
          their not being `perfect`, exert some centripetal force on the
          frame (0,0'). The frame would be moved a distance to the right
          as shown in that Figure, so that by the time the frame (0,0'),
          had moved from S to T, the gyroscopes have moved to Q and Q'
          respectively. However, when the gyroscopes are subsequently
          returned to the right hand side of the frame, the frame will
          be displaced by a distance 2R to the left in FIG. 9.
          Therefore, the combined result of the precessional motion and
          the translational motion would be to move the frame from
          position S to position U, i.e. over a distance less than the
          distance 2R obtained in the perfect case of FIG. 8 but
          nevertheless with a resulting movement in the centre of mass
          of the system that would not be achieved with `dead` masses. </p>
        <p>Advantageously then, a high proportion of the mass of the
          gyroscope means lies in a plane at right angles to the spin
          axis of said gyroscope means and is located at a predetermined
          distance from said spin axis of the gyroscope. </p>
        <p>Other experiments have shown that the greater the wheel spin
          velocity .omega. is in relation to the precessional velocity
          .OMEGA., the less centripetal force is developed. .OMEGA. and
          .omega. are related to the applied torque T and the moment of
          inertia I of the wheel by equation (1). </p>
        <p>Preferably, the ratio of the angular velocity of the
          gyroscope means about its spin axis to the angular velocity of
          said precession is maximised. </p>
        <p>In the absence of a gravitational field the torque to cause
          the gyroscope to precess in the first place has to be
          provided. This may conveniently be obtained from an identical
          gyroscope spinning in the opposite direction and with the same
          angular velocity as the gyroscope against which it is to be
          reacted so that the torque being applied to one gyroscope is
          equal and opposite to the torque on the other gyroscope, the
          net torque on the vehicle is nil and the two gyroscopes then
          precess in the same direction, as a pair, about a centre. </p>
        <p>Preferably therefore, the apparatus comprises at least first
          and second gyroscope means such that the torque required for
          the precession of the first gyroscope means is provided by the
          second gyroscope means. </p>
        <p>In order for this first pair of gyroscopes to precess about a
          centre remote from the centre of the gyroscopes, they must, as
          previously stated, be given a linear momentum proportional to
          their prospective linear tangential velocity when subjected to
          the applied torque. In a preferred embodiment of the invention
          this linear momentum may conveniently be derived from an
          identical pair of gyroscopes with identical attributes
          arranged as a mirror image of the first pair. In this
          arrangement the linear momentum required to launch each pair
          of gyroscopes on their precessional paths are equal and
          opposite and cancel out so that the net momentum outside the
          system is nil. Similarly when the two pairs of gyroscopes
          reach their diametrically opposite point the linear momentum,
          delivered when the torques are removed, are again equal and
          opposite and again cancel out leaving no net momentum outside
          the system. </p>
        <p>Preferably then the apparatus comprises at least first and
          second gyroscope means such that the linear momentum required
          by said first gyroscope means in order to precess about an
          axis remote from its centre is derived from the second
          gyroscope means precessing in the opposite sense. </p>
        <p>Advantageously, the apparatus comprises at least first and
          second pairs of gyroscope means, the torques required by each
          gyroscope means being provided by the other of said pair, and
          each pair providing the linear momentumrequired by the other
          pair. </p>
        <p>Preferably, the path of the gyroscope means is such that the
          motion of the gyroscope means varies continuously between a
          substantially entirely precessional motion and a substantially
          entirely translational motion, thereby providing a smooth
          propulsion to the system. </p>
        <p>A smoother propulsion can also be obtained by providing a
          plurality of groups of gyroscope means and arranging each
          group to impart said second movement the vehicle at a
          different time. </p>
        <p>Some embodiments of the present invention utilise a gyroscope
          means which comprises a wheel which is driven by a central
          hub. A problem associated with such embodiments is that the
          degree of propulsion that can be provided by the apparatus is
          limited by the strength of the materials making up the hub
          itself. </p>
        <p>Preferably therefore, said gyroscope means comprises a
          substantially annular rim which is driven by a means in
          contact with that rim. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, the rim is preferably rotatably supported at a
          plurality of points around the rim. This has the further
          advantage that the level of propulsion that can be provided by
          the apparatus is increased in accordance with the number of
          means rotatably supporting the rim. </p>
        <p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
          gyroscope means comprises two counter-rotating annuli which
          are retained in a frame means. This has the advantage that the
          torques exerted by each rim substantially cancel one another
          and that substantially no net torque is exerted by the frame
          on the vehicle. </p>
        <p>The invention will now be described further, with reference
          to and as illustrated in FIGS. 10 to 28 of the accompanying
          drawings in which: </p>

        <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
        <p>Referring now to FIG. 10, which shows one of the four
          gyroscope units of the first embodiment of the present
          invention, each gyroscope unit comprises a horizontal base
          plate (30), a cradle means (32,34), which cradle means
          supports a translatable shaft (22) and enables the rotation of
          that shaft about a vertical axis AA which passes through the
          centre of the shaft and a horizontal axis BB which also passes
          through the centre of the shaft and intersects the axis AA.
          The shaft (22) in turn carries a gyroscope (23) which is fixed
          against movement along the shaft but is free to rotate around
          the shaft. </p>
        <p>The base plate 30 is arranged to be secured to the vehicle to
          be propelled by the system. </p>
        <p>In more detail, the cradle (32,34) comprises an outer
          U-shaped member (32) which is connected to the base plate (30)
          by a pivot (31) which enables the outer U-shaped member (32)
          to rotate about the vertical axis AA. The outer member (32) is
          formed by a substantially horizontal central section (41)
          which has an arm (42,43) depending vertically from each of its
          ends. Each of these arms (42,43) carries a pivot (35) which is
          disposed on the axis BB. </p>
        <p>The inner member (34) of the cradle is formed from a
          relatively long U shaped member (21) and a pair of side arms
          which extend perpendicularly outwardly from the long member at
          a position half way along its length. The long member consists
          of a substantially horizontal section (46) from either end of
          which an arm (47,48) extends vertically upwardly. Likewise
          each of the side arms (44) has a part extending vertically
          upwardly (50,51) from its end. Each of the arms (47,48)
          extending vertically upwardly from the ends of the long member
          (21) carries a rectangularly shaped bearing (24,25) towards
          its upper end. Each of the vertically depending arms (50,51)
          on the side arms defines a recess which is engaged by the
          respective pivot (35) on the outer cradle member (32). When
          each of the horizontal sections (41,46) of the inner and outer
          cradle members (32,34) are in a horizontal position then the
          centre of the bearings (24,25) which define the axis `CC` are
          positioned to be at the same height as the pivots (35) so that
          the axis `CC` intersects the axes `AA` and `AB`. </p>
        <p>A shaft (22) of substantially regular rectangular
          cross-section and of a length slightly greater than twice the
          distance between the bearings (24,25) is held by the two
          bearings (24,25). Each of these bearings is configured so as
          to prevent rotation of the shaft relative to the inner member
          (34) but to allow it to be linearly translated through the
          bearings. A rack (29) is cut into one side of the shaft and
          extends along the shaft by a distance substantially equal to
          the distance between the two bearings (24,25). A motorised
          bearing (27) is fixedly attached to the shaft (22) at its mid
          point which lies between the two bearings (24,25). A gyroscope
          (23) is in turn carried by this motorised bearing. </p>
        <p>Finally, the means for translating the shaft is provided by a
          motor (26) which is supported by the inner cradle member (34).
          The motor (26) drives a spur gear (28) which engages with the
          rack (29) on one side of the shaft (22). </p>
        <p>To enable the gyroscope unit to be operated outside a
          gravitational field a means is provided for exerting a torque
          about the pivot (35). This torque providing means consists of
          a solenoid actuator (36) which is attached to the upright arm
          (42) by a pivoted clamp (37). The solenoid (36) actuates a rod
          (39) which in turn acts on a connector (40) which in turn
          engages the upright member (51) of the inner part of the
          cradle (34). </p>
        <p>It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that power
          must be supplied to the torque providing means (36), the
          actuating motor (26) and the motorized bearing (27). A person
          skilled in the art will be able to envisage a number of ways
          of supplying this power to the apparatus. </p>
        <p>In order for the means (36) to exert a torque on the
          gyroscope (23) it will be necessary to supply a torque which
          prevents the vehicle (with the base plate (30) and outer
          cradle member (32)) rotating around the pivot (35). This may
          be achieved by securing an identical gyroscope unit to the
          vehicle and it to precess about the axis AA in the same
          direction as the above described first gyroscope unit but with
          the gyroscope in the second unit spinning in the opposite
          direction to the gyroscope in the first unit. For example, the
          inner cradle of the second unit may also be fixedly attached
          to the base plate (30) whereby the torques on that base plate
          owing to the precession of the two gyroscopes cancel. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, in a terrestrial application of the first
          embodiment, the required torque may be provided by the weight
          of the gyroscope, in combination with an equal and opposite
          reaction provided through the vehicle to the base plate (30).
        </p>
        <p>It will further be appreciated that it will not be possible
          to supply each of the gyroscopes of the first and second
          gyroscope units with the requisite momentum along their
          precessional path without imparting an equal and opposite
          momentum to the vehicle. The requisite momentum for the
          precession of the first gyroscope unit may be obtained from a
          third gyroscope unit identical to the first unit and in which
          the pivots (35) of that unit also lie along the axis BB. The
          gyroscope of that third unit may be set spinning in the same
          direction as the gyroscope (23) of the first unit and caused
          to precess in the opposite direction to the gyroscope of the
          first unit, whereby the net linear momentum required to launch
          the first and third gyroscopes would be zero. In order to
          provide the torque required for the precession of the third
          gyroscope unit a fourth gyroscope unit may be provided which
          precesses about the same axis as the third gyroscope unit and
          in the same direction as the third gyroscope unit but with the
          gyroscope of the fourth unit spinning in the opposite
          direction to the gyroscope of the third unit. Furthermore, the
          fourth unit supplies the requisite launch momentum for the
          second gyroscope. </p>
        <p>Since the gyroscopes of the first and third gyroscope units
          are spinning in the opposite direction to the gyroscopes of
          the second and fourth gyroscope units then it will be seen
          that the torques required to start the gyroscopes spinning are
          also cancelled in the above arrangement. Hence, no net torque
          is exerted on the vehicle. </p>
        <p>It is to be appreciated that in terrestrial applications,
          some or all of the required torque and linear momentum may be
          provided by the medium through which the vehicle is
          travelling, or the surface over which the vehicle is
          travelling. For example, the torque may be provided by
          reaction against rails along which the vehicle is travelling,
          or, in the case of a boat, by reaction between the keel and
          the water. </p>
        <p>Preferably, however, the torques and linear momenta will also
          be balanced in a propulsion apparatus for terrestrial use. For
          example, in the case of a propulsion system for a boat this
          has the further advantage that the water is less disturbed and
          quieter propulsion results. </p>
        <p>The cycle of operations of the first embodiment of this
          invention is shown in FIG. 11. For simplicity only the ends
          (47,48) of the inner cradle (34), the gyroscope (23), with the
          direction of spin of gyroscope (23) indicated by the arrow,
          and the motor (26) of the first gyroscope unit are drawn. At
          `A` a torque is applied to gyroscope (23) and the system is
          allowed to precess to `B` where the torque is removed. The
          motor (26) now operates and attempts to return the assembly to
          its previous position in space but because the gyroscope (23)
          is massive with respect to the remainder of the system the
          supports move rather than the gyroscope (23) as shown at `C`.
          The gyroscope (23) is again caused to precess to `D` as
          previously, the torque once more removed and the motor
          reversed. The supports again move further than the gyroscope
          (23) as shown at `E` and the whole system has been caused to
          translate a distance `S`. The system will be seen to be in the
          same position as at `A` and the whole cycle may be repeated. </p>
        <p>It will be realised that the operations of the other three
          gyroscope units may be carried out in synchronism with the
          operation of the first gyroscope unit such that each of the
          gyroscopes will be translated in the same direction at the
          same time. </p>
        <p>In order to reduce the step like nature of the movement of
          the vehicle being propelled a number of other groups of four
          gyroscopes may be provided. It will be understood that each of
          these may be operated serially so as to provide a steady
          succession of movement to the vehicle and thereby smooth the
          propulsion of the vehicle. </p>
        <p>Another method of smoothing the propulsion of the vehicle is
          to combine the translational and precessional part of the
          gyroscope cycle into a single compound motion so as to allow
          the proportion of translational and precessional motion to
          vary smoothly throughout that cycle. The second embodiment of
          this invention is an example of an apparatus which achieves
          this. </p>
        <p>Referring now to FIG. 12, the apparatus of the second
          embodiment consists of three principal parts. The first of
          these is a means for rotating the direction of the spin axis
          CC of a gyroscope (60) about a perpendicular axis AA which
          intersects the axis CC, the second of which is a means for
          causing the centre of the gyroscope to follow a circular path
          about an axis BB which is parallel to the axis AA and
          displaced therefrom by distance D, and the third of which is a
          means (80,81) for rotating the gyroscope (60) about its own
          spin axis CC. </p>
        <p>The means for rotating the direction of the spin axis of the
          gyroscope about the first axis AA comprises a horizontal bar
          (63) rotatably driven about the axis AA by a shaft (62) which
          is in turn connected to a motor ( not shown). The bar (63) has
          two arms (64,65) which depend vertically downwardly from each
          end of the bar (63). A horizontal shaft (61) is carried
          between the arms (64,65). The gyroscope (60) is rotatably and
          slidably supported on the shaft (61) at a point intermediate
          the two downwardly depending arms (64,65). In this way the
          direction of the spin axis CC of the gyroscope is constrained
          without dictating the position of the gyroscope along the
          shaft (61). </p>
        <p>The means for causing the centre of the gyroscope to follow a
          circular path about the parallel axis BB comprises a lower
          shaft (75) which pivotally supports a substantially horizontal
          second bar (70) which is thereby rotated about the axis BB,
          (which axis passes through a first end of the bar (70)), by a
          motor (not shown) at an angular velocity which is twice that
          of the angular velocity of the rotation of the upper bar (63).
          A vertical shaft (76) is pivotably supported at the opposite
          end of the bar (70) at a distance D from its first end and is
          fixedly attached to the base of a substantially U-shaped
          member shown generally at 71. The U-shaped member (71)
          comprises a horizontal base part which has two upwardly
          extending arms (72,73) at its ends, each of these arms having
          a bearing through which the shaft (61) passes. These bearings
          support the shaft (61) on either side of the gyroscope (60),
          sleeves (77,78) being provided around the shaft (61) to
          maintain the position of the gyroscope between the two
          upwardly extending arms (72,73). Each of these sleeves is
          preferably of an equal length, thereby positioning the centre
          of the gyroscope (60) directly above the axis of that shaft
          (76). In this way the centre of the gyroscope (60) is
          constrained to follow a circle centred on the vertical axis BB
          and of radius D, where the distance D is smaller than one
          quarter of the distance between the downwardly depending arms
          (64,65) less one half the external distance between the
          upwardly extending arms (72,73). </p>
        <p>The means for rotating the gyroscope about its own spin axis
          comprises a motorized bearing (not shown) similar to that
          described in relation to the first embodiment. Those skilled
          in the art will be able to envisage a number of ways in which
          the required power can be supplied to the motor. </p>
        <p>Each of the shaft (62) and the lower shaft (75) is arranged
          to be attached to the vehicle to be propelled. </p>
        <p>As with the first embodiment of the present invention, the
          torque developed or required in the precession of the
          gyroscopes may be obtained from another "mirror image" system
          so that the two torques cancel leaving no net torque on
          vehicle. Also, again as with the first embodiment of this
          invention, any resulting uncancelled forces may be provided by
          another gyroscope unit. In practice therefore several
          gyroscope units may be employed together as shown in FIG. 14.
        </p>
        <p>The operation of the unit of the second embodiment of the
          invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 13. The
          rotation of bar (63) about axis `AA` is at half the rate of
          rotation of the arm (70). When these two motions are combined
          the motion of the gyroscope is substantially that depicted in
          FIG. 13, which shows the sequential positions of the gyroscope
          for one half turn of the bar (63). It will be seen that the
          gyroscope moves from one end of the shaft (61) to the opposite
          end of the shaft (61) in the same period as the shaft is
          rotated by 180.degree.. The way the gyroscope is depicted in
          FIG. 12 corresponds approximately to position (H) in FIG. 13.
        </p>
        <p>Before bar (63) completes a whole turn the gyroscope has to
          make a second complete path about its locus but during the
          second turn the direction of spin of the gyroscope is opposite
          to the direction in which it was spinning on the previous
          turn. The direction of torque demanded by, or that must be
          applied to, the gyroscope has therefore to be reversed each
          time the gyroscope passes position (E) in FIG. 13. </p>
        <p>From FIG. 13 it will be seen that the motion of the gyroscope
          is essentially in two parts; first when it is undergoing
          substantially precessional motion between positions (H) and
          (B2) corresponding to position (B) but on the second
          revolution around the axis `BB` and second when it is
          undergoing substantially linear translation between positions
          (D) and (F). In both revolutions the direction of linear
          translation is in the same direction and will tend to impart a
          linear cycle of momentum to the vehicle while the motion
          between positions (H) and (B2), being substantially
          precessional, develops significantly less momentum. </p>
        <p>Combined in the manner described it is possible to provide a
          cyclic pulse of momentum in the opposite direction to the
          linear direction of translation of the gyroscope, and provide
          a smoother propulsion than is provided by an apparatus such as
          the first embodiment, in which the motion of the gyroscope may
          be divided into a purely precessional part and a purely
          translational part. </p>
        <p>Just as in an electric circuit, a voltage applied across a
          resistor causes a current to flow in that resistor, so equally
          a current of that value being passed through that same
          resistor will cause a voltage to appear across it, so a torque
          may be seen as the cause of a precession or conversely that
          precession may be seen as the cause of a torque. This is of
          especial significance with respect to the third embodiment of
          the invention. </p>
        <p>Generally, the operation of the gyroscope unit of the third
          embodiment will now be explained with reference to FIG. 15. In
          that Figure, a gyroscope (M) is precessed around a horizontal
          circle, the torque on the gyroscope being provided along a
          radius of that circle, and the axis of spin of the gyroscope
          at all times being tangential to that circle, the wheel
          subsequently being returned along a path which lies in the
          plane of the wheel. </p>
        <p>The operation of the third embodiment of the present
          invention can be understood by considering the arrangement of
          FIG. 15 in a situation of zero gravity and ignoring, for the
          present, the fact that any torque in one direction is only
          produced as the result of an equal torque in the opposite
          direction. In operation, the torque motor twists the shaft (R)
          which causes the wheel (M) to precess from A to B in a
          horizontal plane. This is a precessional stroke. At B the
          torque is removed and a second return motor, incorporated as
          part of the pivot (O), drives the shaft (R) in a downward
          semicircle, between the supporting plates (G, G'), back to A.
          This is a reaction stroke. If, instead of being precessed from
          A to B by an applied torque, the wheel were forced round the
          same path, the torque motor being removed so that the solid
          shaft were not interrupted, then the wheel would help itself
          to the amount of torque required to maintain that rate of
          precession, from the bearings at the pivot (O). </p>
        <p>The gyroscope unit of the third embodiment of the present
          invention is shown in FIG. 16. The unit has a horizontal base
          plate which rotatably supports a horizontal turntable which is
          free to rotate about a vertical axis through its centre. A
          motor is provided to rotate the turntable relative to the
          base. A pair of parallel-spaced substantially triangular
          plates extend vertically upwardly from the turntable. A
          horizontal lower bevelled gear is disposed directly above the
          centre of the turntable and is carried in between the two
          upwardly extending plates. The lower bevelled gear is fixed
          against rotation relative to the base plate. An upper vertical
          bevelled gear is pivotally mounted between the uppermost ends
          of the upwardly extending plate. The upper bevelled gear and
          lower bevelled gear are of equal size and are arranged to mesh
          with one another. A pendulum shaft is carried in plane
          parallel to the two upwardly extending plates by the upper
          bevelled gear. The free end of the pendulum shaft is provided
          with a fork which is arranged to rotatably support the
          gyroscope wheel. </p>
        <p>The bevel gears of the third embodiment enable the precession
          and reaction strokes to be geared together, such that, for
          rotation of the support plates (G, G') fixed to turntable (J)
          with respect to the baseplate (H), the shaft (R) carrying the
          wheel is rotated by the same amount, using the bevel gears (at
          O) in place of the return motor shown in FIG. 15. Hence, the
          gyroscope unit of the third embodiment of the present
          invention is driven by a single motor so that for every
          180.degree. of precession in the horizontal plane it performs
          180.degree. of reactive rotation in the vertical plane. </p>
        <p>The resultant motion may now be seen to take place entirely
          within the space ABCDEFGH of the theoretical circumscribing
          box and, as above in FIG. 16, never enters the other half of
          the box at all. </p>
        <p>Looking in plan, i.e. downward on plane ABCD, the motion of
          the wheel is seen to be as in FIG. 18. In the parts of the
          path in the lowermost half of that Figure, precession
          dominates and mass transfer is taking place, whereas, in the
          parts of the path in the uppermost half non-precession
          dominates and a reaction force is developed. </p>
        <p>FIG. 19 shows the elevation as viewed into plane ABFE for a
          full 360.degree. of rotation the turntable. The torque
          demanded at the centre point is seen to alternate between one
          half rotation and the next. </p>
        <p>FIG. 20 shows the elevation as viewed into plane ADHE. In
          addition to the alternating torque required, there are seen to
          be alternating reaction forces parallel to AE and BF which do
          not therefore contribute to propulsion of the vehicle. </p>
        <p>These forces along with the torque which has to be provided
          by the base (H) may be cancelled out by additional similar
          arrangements in mirror image. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, FIG. 19 shows that the forces parallel to
          AB and EF do not cancel but instead combine to drive the base
          in one direction. The cancellation on one axis and
          supplementation on another at right angles to it is a
          fundamental property of three dimensional space and is also
          exemplified by the use of the left and right hand rules of
          electromagnetic theory. </p>
        <p>In order to cancel the actual torque developed in driving the
          wheel on the turntable (J) round the baseplate (H) an
          identical turntable may be mounted alongside on the same
          baseplate with the second wheel occupying the space DCJIHGKL
          (allowing such additional space as might be required for
          clearance). The two wheels spin in the same direction when
          adjacent but are driven in mirror image paths by equal and
          opposite torques from the same motor resulting in no net
          torque on the vehicle. </p>
        <p>Similarly this pair of wheels develop a net torque in the
          plane DCGH against the baseplate which may be cancelled by
          another pair of identical wheels mounted immediately beneath
          the first pair, again as a mirror image of them. The four
          wheels may then be driven by a single motor so mounted that it
          is free to rotate on baseplate (H) and all its power is
          absorbed by the losses in one pair of wheels being exactly
          equal to the losses in the second pair while the sum of these
          losses is supplied by the motor(s) typically though not
          exclusively when the gyroscope units illustrated in FIG. 16
          are arranged together as in FIG. 17. </p>
        <p>In the fourth embodiment of the invention FIG. 21 shows a
          frame F on which is mounted a turntable T capable of being
          rotated with respect to F by a motor M. A motorised gyroscopic
          means G, which may be similar to that described in relation to
          FIG. 10 below, is rigidly mounted in a carrier B. This carrier
          is located by flanged wheels S in turntable T so hat it is
          free to rotate about an axis E normal to the plane of the
          turntable but will be carried round by the turntable. The axis
          E is substantially at right angles to the axis of rotation of
          the gyroscopic means G. An actuator A is fitted in such a
          manner as to be able to operate a clamp C and prevent the free
          rotation of the gyroscopic means and its carrier with respect
          to the turntable. </p>
        <p>In operation, the gyroscopic means is first supplied with
          power and allowed to reach its designed operating rotational
          speed. The motor M is energised causing the turntable to
          rotate. At .PI. the actuator is activated clamping the frame B
          to the turntable and causing the gyroscopic means thereby to
          be forcibly precessed through an arc of 180.degree.. At 2.PI.
          the actuator is released so that the frame B is free to rotate
          while the turntable continues turning a further 180.degree.
          back to .PI. without stopping. The actuator is again energised
          and the cycle repeated. </p>
        <p>During the first half of the cycle just described the force
          acting upon the gyroscopic means to maintain it in the
          prescribed arc is less than that calculated were the gyroscope
          means a simple non rotating object of the same mass. During
          the second half of the cycle the full calculated force is
          required. Thus the relative movement of the effective centre
          of mass of the whole apparatus with respect to the frame F
          takes place with a fraction of the reaction upon the frame
          during the first half cycle F compared to the reaction upon
          the frame during the second half cycle, resulting in an
          overall transfer of mass in direction P. </p>
        <p>In practice the torque developed by the gyroscopic means on
          the carrier B has to be provided by an identical inverted
          turntable complete with an identical counter rotating
          gyroscopic means, carrier, actuator and clamp, both turntables
          driven by the same motor. The net torque required to maintain
          rotation of the turntables as just described and the angular
          momentum developed when the carrier(s) B are clamped is
          supplied from an identical mirror image pair of turntables
          such as the arrangement illustrated in FIG. 22. Such an
          apparatus as illustrated in FIGS. 21 and 22 or those described
          in the following FIGS. 23 to 28 inclusive are not necessarily
          limited to one gyroscopic means per turntable and a number of
          such gyroscopic means might be attached symmetrically to each
          turntable provided that the arrangement is repeated for
          reflecting and balancing turntables. </p>
        <p>For clarity, each gyroscopic means thus far described has
          been considered to consist of a simple, single, motorised
          bearing with a massive outer rim. However, if the mass of the
          rotating part of each gyroscopic means is concentrated in a
          `thin` rim, to the extend indeed that the entire centre of the
          gyroscopic means were absent, the theoretical gyroscopic
          effectiveness of such mass would be increased. If an identical
          rim, revolving in the opposite direction, be mounted alongside
          the first rim, the torque required to cause one rim to precess
          would always balance that required by the second rim.
          Furthermore the forces required to develop this torque are
          provided at either end of a diameter where they are needed and
          not through the shafts, hubs and webs, thereby concentrating
          the highly stressed sections to two compact zones with reduced
          risk and lower weight penalty. </p>
        <p>FIG. 23 is a simple perspective sketch of such an arrangement
          where G and G' are the two rim-only gyroscopic means, M is a
          common motor driving both rims and mounted within the
          enveloping carrier B to which are fixed a series of rotating
          supports R that locate the rims. The carrier B is here shown
          with flanged wheels S to mount this unit into a turntable as
          described in the fourth embodiment and illustrated in FIG. 24.
        </p>
        <p>FIGS. 25 and 26 show two arrangements of the fifth and fourth
          embodiments so combined as to illustrate that mass transfer
          may be derived from the difference in centrifugal force
          between rapidly spinning masses being precessed and being
          swung round an arc without precession as firstly </p>
        <p>a) in FIG. 25 by arranging for the effective mass transfer P
          and P' of two identical counter rotating systems to cancel and
          combining the effective difference of resultant centrifugal
          forces C and C' or as secondly b) in FIG. 26 by summing the
          effective mass transfer P and P' and arranging for the
          effective centrifugal forces C and C' to cancel. </p>
        <p>FIGS. 27 and 28 show the fifth embodiment combined with the
          fourth embodiment turned through 90.degree.0 at the start of
          the cycle to indicate that the claim to mass transfer does not
          rely in particular to the relative angle the fifth embodiment
          may have with respect to the fourth embodiment at the
          commencement of a cycle provided that an arc of precession of
          approximately 180.degree. is followed by a further arc of
          180.degree. without precession whereby the transfer of the
          mass of the gyroscopic means is transmitted to the vehicle. </p>
        <p>In other words, the purpose of FIGS. 27 and 28 is to clarify
          the claim that mass transfer is achieved is not limited to any
          one initial attitude of the fifth embodiment with respect to
          the fourth embodiment but may apply to any attitude provided
          that the axis E is substantially normal to the plane of mass
          transfer and, by definition, is substantially parallel to the
          axis of precession. </p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the use of `single gyroscopic means` being
          described in each of the preceding three other embodiments of
          the invention, the `twin gyroscopic means` of the fourth
          embodiment may be substituted for the appropriate pairs of
          single gyroscopic means in each of the former embodiments. </p>
        <p>It will be seen how the present invention provides a
          propulsion system which does not necessitate the carriage of
          volatile fuel and which need not accelerate the vehicle in a
          conventional sense since it ceases to move the vehicle when it
          is inactive. Furthermore, it will be seen how the propulsion
          system may be powered by a renewable energy source such as
          stellar radiation or may be powered by a deliberately focused
          distant energy source such as a microwave power beam. </p>

          <b><font size="+1">"Laithwaite’s Amazing Invention"</font></b>
          <p>(Unidentified magazine, Jan. 2, 1975)</p>
        </center>
        <p>Professor Eric Laithwaite, of the Imperial College of Science
          and Technology, England, has invented an anti-gravity machine!
          Such a device has been the tool of science fiction writers and
          the dream of thinkers such as H.G. Wells and Jules Verne, but
          until now e everyone had dismissed the idea as an
          impossibility. </p>
        <p>Now Professor Laithwaite, who is already famous for inventing
          the linear induction motor, has demonstrated that his machine
          actually works. When switched on it reduces its weight! </p>
        <p>If the machine is truly functional it must be but a short
          step to building a machine that will reduce its weight so much
          that it will simply float away. </p>
        <p>The professor insists that he has discovered a principle that
          will solve the problems of interstellar flight. “With just a
          cupful of uranium we could reach the nearest star”, he says. </p>
        <p>The professor’s prototype antigravity machine was
          demonstrated to the historic Royal Institution recently. He
          placed it on a pair of kitchen scales to prove that it does
          reduce its weight when in action. </p>
        <p>Opinions vary whether or not it did are sharply divided. A
          disclaimer appeared in the prestigious New Scientist magazine
          soon after. The good professor explained patiently to us that
          the writer had no idea of what he had demonstrated and did not
          understand the principles involved. </p>
        <p>The machine itself consists of a central upright rod which is
          spun by means of an electric motor at its base. Towards the
          top of the rod two smaller rods connect laterally. On the end
          of each is a brass gyroscope. </p>
        <p>When these gyroscopes are spun with a blast of compressed air
          their movement causes the hinged rods to rise and revolve
          around the main spindle. This revolution is aided by the
          electric motor. </p>
        <p>A curved rail counteracts their tendency to rise and forces
          them down again. The reaction to this provides the thrust for
          lifting, as the cycle repeats itself again and again. </p>
        <p>The professor insists that he has no quarrel with Newtonian
          laws of motion, although many claims have been made by less
          well-informed commentators that he has. “But I do think
          Newton’s laws need modifying”, he comments. </p>
        <p>Newton, it seems, rather overlooked the problems of
          gyroscopes and their tendency to do unexpected things.
          Laithwaite contends that Newton’s laws of motion should be
          modified to account for gyroscopic precessions. </p>
        <p>The secret of his anti-gravity machine lies in the fact that
          no energy is required to return the gyroscope arms to their
          starting positions --- gyroscopes do that naturally as they
          precess. </p>
        <p>It’s a difficult problem to explain the workings of the
          machine. Only time will tell us, the general public, if the
          professor has done his homework properly. </p>
        <p>The scientist himself intends to demonstrate that he has
          indeed found a new kind of "inertial drive". "By 1976", he
          says, "I intend to lift a man off the floor of the Royal
          Institution". </p>
        <p>Finally it should be known that the professor is no
          "crackpot" inventor. He has the following degrees: BSc., MSc.,
          PhD., DSc., and has won international honors for his
          engineering achievements. </p>

        <p>The Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering at Imperial
          College London, Eric Laithwaite, highly successful inventor of
          the linear motor, has entered the sacrosanct domain of the
          mechanical engineers. And he says "they need me". Last Friday
          as the piece de resistance of his evening discourse at the
          Royal Institution he demonstrated a machine that, he claimed,
          violated gravity and produced lift without any external
          reaction. </p>
        <p>The machine is pictured here in action on a kitchen spring
          balance, just as he demonstrated it. The machine uses two
          precessing tops whose precession (slow motion of the axis of
          rotation about a vertical axis under the action of gravity) is
          assisted by the motor at the bottom. This makes the tops rise.
          The tops are restrained from rising by a track like a big
          dipper, and as the tops follow the track the whole machine
          jogs up and down. Professor Laithwaite contends that there is
          more jog up than jog down. </p>
        <p>Laithwaite began his discourse with a series of
          entertainments from his work on electromagnetic levitation,
          draing applause and laughter from his evening dressed audience
          like a good juggler, and throwing in his usual flamboyant
          claims. All this was to prove Don Quixote’s phrase&nbsp; "all
          things are possible". Then he moved into h=gyros (mmore
          exactly, tops). </p>
        <p>Tops are certainly fascinating. They fascinated the
          Victorians and the Edwardians after them, and many a Newtonian
          treatise has been written about their motion. They are used
          with great precision in gyroscopes in ships, submarines,
          aeroplanes and rockets, so there must be some understanding of
          their motion. But Laithwaite contended that the familiar
          precessing top that can be bought in the toyshop, being of a
          different design (not supported through its center of
          gravity), is not properly described by Newton’s laws of
          motion. </p>
        <p>He drew the curtain covering the blackboard to reveal a
          modification of Newton’s second law (in an inertial frame)
          that bears the same relation to the usual equation as does the
          equation for the voltage on a resistance, capacitance and
          inductance to Ohm’s law. </p>
        <p>In practical terms he had four main contentions about
          gyroscopic precession. First, he believes that the angular
          momentum of precession (about a vertical axis) is created out
          of nothing, so that angular momentum is not conserved about
          that axis in direct contradiction of Newton’s mechanics;
          second, he believes the precession is not accompanied by any
          centrifugal force (the force you feel if you swing a bucket
          around in the garden);&nbsp; third, he contended that it
          requires no force to stop the precession; and fourth that if
          the precession is speeded up, the tops (which certainly rise)
          do so without there being any consequent downward reaction. </p>
        <p>It is my opinion that none of these contentions was proved by
          the experiments Laithwaite performed at the Royal Institution
          during his discourse. Perhaps he will be able to do more
          precise experiments which will bear him out, but until he does
          so his case remains at least unproven. To take just one
          example --- and the most spectacular --- his anti-gravity
          machine weighed to within half a pound of the upper limit of
          the scales (where there was a mechanical stop). So even if the
          reaction on the scales was reduced during one part of the
          machine’s cycle (and it indeed went down 5 pounds out of its
          total 20), the reaction would not have shown on the scales if
          it had gone above 20 pounds on the least of the cycle. The
          needle in fact swung violently between its upper limit and 15
          pounds. </p>
        <p>You have probably got the impression by now that I am
          skeptical of Eric Laithwaite’s views on the gyro. You would be
          right. I believe he has got it wrong by changing fields too
          quickly and jumping to conclusions --- or else we are all
          being taken for a marvelous ride! Yet he said in his discourse
          that his "life had led up to this moment", and he appeared to
          be extremely serious about his views. </p>
        <p>If indeed he is not joking he is beginning to bear a strong
          and sad resemblance to one of his heroes, Don Quixote. A giant
          (figuratively and physically), he is gentle (he is an expert
          on butterflies) and has all Don Quixote’s lovable but arrogant
          naivity. This time he has tilted at windmills. </p>
        <p><b>Newton's Point of View</b> </p>
        <p>Newton, though long dead, can still give us his views through
          his equations of motion. The first point he might make about
          Laithwaite’s experiments is that they involved "fast" tops.
          These are tops that have far more kinetic energy in the
          gravitational field (weight times distance the center of
          gravity of the top can move). Such tops have a deceptively
          simple motion that can confuse generalization to slow tops. </p>
        <p>One example of this is the question of the "creation" of
          angular momentum about a vertical axis when the top begins to
          precess. In fact the top, when released from a stationary
          horizontal position, falls vertically until has a component of
          its own high internal angular momentum along the vertical ---
          just enough to compensate for the angular moentum of
          precession. This fall (which indetail is a damped out
          nutation) is hardly noticeable in a fast top but is obvious in
          a slow one. Hence the creation of the angular momentum of
          precession. </p>
        <p>A similar remark applies to the centrifugal force of
          precession; if a top is fast the centrifugal force is only a
          small fraction of the weight of the top, so it is hardly
          noticeable. For a slow top the force becomes more important as
          the precession speeds up, and this is one of the contributions
          to the falling over of a toy top on its support as it slows
          down. </p>
        <p>Next, according to our old friend Newton, a force is
          certainly needed to stop a precessing top, albeit a small one.
          The exact motion of the top after it has been stopped depends
          on the details of its previous motion. So in both the case of
          the centrifugal force and stopping the precession there is a
          simple test by which Newton’s and Laithwaite’s contentions can
          be distinguished. </p>
        <p>Finally there is the question of the reactionless rise of an
          assisted, precessing top. Laithwaite agrees that the exact
          amount of energy needed to lift the top must be introduced by
          twisting its vertical support, so there is no gaining
          something for nothing on that score. Newton would argue that
          no vertical reaction was necessary anyway once the top started
          upwards (just as no extra reaction is necessary on a crane
          when it is steadily lifting its load). And to test the
          contention that the machine gets lighter, Newton would ask
          Laithwaite to measure the impulse (force times time of
          action), not the force itself. Such sophistication is beyond a
          set of kitchen scales. </p>
