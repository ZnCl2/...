        <p>Mass spectrographic and isotope studies have shown that
          potassium, rubidium, and especially cesium are most
          efficiently taken up by cancer cells. This uptake was enhanced
          by Vitamins A and C as well as salts of zinc and selenium. The
          quantity of cesium taken up was sufficient to raise the cell
          to the 8 pH range. Where cell mitosis ceases and the life of
          the cell is short. Tests on mice fed cesium and rubidium
          showed marked shrinkage in the tumor masses within 2 weeks. In
          addition, the mice showed none of the side effects of cancer.
          Tests have been carried out on over 30 humans. In each case
          the tumor masses disappeared. Also all pains and effects
          associated with cancer disappeared within 12 to 36 hr; the
          more chemotherapy and morphine the patient had taken, the
          longer the withdrawal period. Studies of the food intake in
          areas where the incidences of cancer are very low showed that
          it met the requirements for the high pH therapy. </p>
        <p>Cancer therapy.....Cesium.....High
          pH.....Pain.....Potassium.....Rubidium.....Tumor.....Vitamins</p>
        <p>The High pH Therapy for cancer was arrived at from an
          extensive series of physical experiments. These involved the
          isotope effect across membranes of many types, normal plant
          and animal, embryonic, cancer, and synthetic. It also involved
          mass spectrographic analyses of membranes and cells, as well
          as fluorescence and phosphorescence decay studies of many
          types of cells and parts thereof. It is the thesis of this
          paper that the results obtained throw a direct light upon the
          mechanism of carcinogenesis, and also indicate a therapy.
          Tests on both mice and humans substantiate this theoretical
          approach [1-8]. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
        <p>The isotope effect throws a very direct light on the
          mechanism of carcinogenesis. In this study it was shown that
          the <sup>39</sup>K/41<sub>K</sub>ratio in ocean water down to
          6000 ft was 14,20000 [9-11]. </p>
        <p>In normal matured cells, both plant and animal, the ratio
          varied from 14.25 to 14.21. Embryonic and cancer cells all
          gave a ratio of 14.35. In the case of all synthetic cells
          across which there was a potential gradient, the ratio was
          14.35. From these values it will be seen that the ratio in
          normal living cells indicates that as many isotopes leave the
          cell as enter. </p>
        <p>In the case of potassium for embryonic and cancer cells as
          well as synthetic type cells with all types of membranes even
          including liquid mercury films the observed isotope ratio was
          given by equation 1. </p>
        <p>(<sup>39</sup>K/ 41<sub>K</sub>) o = (<sup>39</sup>K/41<sub>K</sub>)n
(41










          + m / 39 + m) <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> (1)</p>
        <p>where <b><i>n</i></b> refers to the normal ratio, <b><i>o</i></b>
          to the observed ratio, and <b><i>m</i></b> is the associated
          mass for the ions. </p>
        <p>All cations in solution are associated. The attached mass for
          Cs<sup>+</sup> is 3 molecules of water, for Rb<sup>+</sup> it
          is 5 molecules, for K<sup>+</sup> is 7 molecules. For cations
          below potassium in the Electromotive Series all ions are
          highly associated. This is to be expected from their position
          in the Hoffmeister Series. In the case of Ca<sup>++</sup> the
          association is 30 molecules, while Na<sup>+</sup> is 16.
          Equation (1) holds for all cations tested from H<sup>+</sup>to
          U<sup>+</sup>. The value of <i>m</i> however will vary when
          polar molecules are present in the solution. For example, K<sup>+</sup>
          can also attach glucose. In contrast, Ca<sup>++</sup> can
          attach a wide variety of molecules; it is this cation that
          transports peroxides into the cell, as well as metabolic
          products out of the cell. </p>
        <p>The results given in equation (1) are most significant in
          that they show that transport is dependent entirely upon the
          frequency with which the ions strike the membrane surface. It
          is not a matter of capillary action, but one on which the ion
          and its associated mass pass directly through the bonding
          space between molecules which comprise the membrane. That the
          associated molecules are not lost in this transport is due to
          the fact that the attraction between the molecules and the ion
          is far greater than their attraction by the material of the
          membrane. </p>
        <p>In the case of potassium an exact similarity exists between
          embryonic and cancer cells. The isotope ratio indicates that
          the K<sup>+</sup> ions are taken up by the most efficient
          process possible. The same held true for Cs<sup>+</sup> and Rb<sup>+</sup>.
        </p>
        <p>In contrast to the above, a vast difference exists for
          cations below potassium in the EMS. In the case of embryonic
          cells all cations tested obeyed equation (1). In the case of
          cancer cells cations below potassium were taken up sparingly,
          if at all. For example the amount of calcium in cancer cells
          is only about one percent of that in normal cells [18]. </p>
        <p>The above isotope effect for potassium which transports
          glucose into the cell, and for calcium which transports oxygen
          are most significant with respect to Cancer. They mean that
          glucose can readily enter cancer cells but that oxygen cannot
          enter. This accounts for the anaerobic state of cancer cells
          pointed out by Warburg as early as 1925 [26]. </p>
        <p>The mechanism responsible for the similarity in the isotope
          effect for potassium and rubidium in cancer and embryonic
          cells and for their marked difference in case of calcium was
          investigated in some detail using mass spectrographic
          analyses, and also fluorescence and phosphorescence decay
          patterns. </p>
        <p>The phosphorescence decay patterns were found to be peculiar
          to and specific for all cell types or parts thereof [12-15].
          It should be mentioned that the decay spectra is due entirely
          to the light emitted from the energized double bonds. All
          double bonds are capable of being raised to the energized
          state. While the fluorescence spectra and the phosphorescence
          decay patterns are both specific for each double bond they can
          be influenced by adjacent strong polar radicals. Again, both
          can be completely depressed by molecules absorbed over the
          surface; thus morphine, as well as attached polycyclic type
          molecules, will completely depress the excitation of the P=O
          radicals which characterize all cell membrane surfaces. </p>
        <p>It was observed that the membranes tested gave a
          phosphorescence decay pattern due almost entirely to the P=O
          radicals which are composed of phospholipids. These radicals
          are specifically oriented over each type of membrane. This is
          most significant from the point of view of membrane action,
          since the P=O radicals are moderately strong electron donors
          in the ground state and strong to powerful donors in the
          energized state. This is due to the fact that the ionization
          potentials, 1st to 5th, are appreciably higher for the 0 than
          the P atom. This means that the 4 bonding electron orbitals
          will be displaced nearer the 0 atom thus surrounding this atom
          with a pronounced negative field. The P atom is thus positive
          in nature. </p>
        <p>The above results are most important with respect to membrane
          action. They show that the strong electron acceptors Cs<sup>+</sup>,
          Rb<sup>+</sup>, and K<sup>+</sup> can be attracted into the
          membrane so that they will enter the negative potential
          gradient which exists across all living membranes. In contrast
          to these cations, the highly associated cations farther down
          in the EMS are not sufficiently strong electron acceptors to
          be drawn into this gradient except when the P=O radicals are
          in the energized state. This means that K<sup>+</sup> cations
          which transport glucose into the cell can readily enter cancer
          cells, but that Ca<sup>++</sup> ions which transport oxygen
          into the cell cannot enter. In the normal cell the glucose,
          upon entering the cell, reacts with the oxygen in the cell and
          is burned to carbon dioxide and water with the liberation of
          heat. This heat in turn is absorbed on the membrane surface
          and raises the P=O radicals to an energized state which
          permits them to attach more Ca<sup>++</sup> ions. Thus it will
          be seen that the amount of oxygen entering the cell is
          determined by oxidation within the cell, primarily that of
          glucose. This action is responsible for the pH control
          mechanism of the cell which maintains a value near 7.35. </p>
        <p>The reactivity of the double bond has been studied in some
          detail using both light absorption and electron impact. It was
          found that energy states of the order of those produced by
          metabolic processes were not reactive. In contrast, high
          energy states such as those that are induced by radioactivity.
          are very reactive. Intermediate energy states in the ultra
          violet range were not reactive. Intermediate energy states in
          the ultra violet range were not reactive by electron impact,
          but slightly with light quanta. Here however the reactivity
          increased with a high power of the energy intensity per unit
          area [16]. This suggests that the reactivity may be due to the
          multiple absorption of light quanta, thus raising the energy
          of the bond to the sum of the quanta absorbed (see Table 1). </p>

        <p>THE MECHANISM OF CARCINOGENESIS </p>
        <p>The experimental information presented in the previous
          section involving the isotope effect, mass spectrographic
          analyses, and fluorescence and phosphorescence decay, combined
          with the pH data supplied by Von Ardenne [23-25], makes it
          possible to define the mechanism involved in carcinogenesis.
          This mechanism is very different from the accepted one of
          carcinogens entering the cell and becoming attached to the
          DNA. This mechanism will not explain any of the experimental
          data outlined briefly herein. </p>
        <p>The proposed mechanism can be outlined in four steps. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 1</i></b> </p>
        <p>The attachment of carcinogenic type molecules to the membrane
          surface. This involves two factors: (a) the presence of
          carcinogenic-type molecules primarily of the polycyclic type,
          and (b) an energized state of the membrane, which may result
          from prolonged irritation. When these molecules are attached
          to the membrane glucose can still enter the cell, but oxygen
          cannot. The cell thus becomes anaerobic. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 2</i></b> </p>
        <p>In the absence of oxygen, the glucose undergoes fermentation
          to lactic acid. The cell pH then drops to 7 and finally down
          to 6.5. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 3</i></b> </p>
        <p>In the acid medium the DNA loses its positive and negative
          radical sequence. In addition, the amino acids entering the
          cell are changed. As a consequence, the RNA is changed and the
          cell completely loses its control mechanism. Chromosomal
          aberrations may occur. </p>
        <p><b><i>Step 4</i></b> </p>
        <p>In the acid medium the various cell enzymes are completely
          changed. Von Ardenne has shown that lysosomal enzymes are
          changed into very toxic compounds. These toxins kill the cells
          in the main body of the tumor mass. A tumor therefore consists
          of a thin layer of rapidly growing cells surrounding the dead
          mass [3]. The acid toxins leak out from the tumor mass and
          poison the host. They thus give rise to the pains generally
          associated with cancer. They can also act as carcinogens. </p>
        <p><b>HIGH AND LOW pH THERAPIES</b> </p>
        <p>Only two therapies will be mentioned here. Both are
          apparently effective. These are the Low pH therapy devised by
          Von Ardenne <i>et al</i>. [23-25] and the High pH therapy
          developed by the writer. </p>
        <p><b><i>The Low pH Therapy</i></b> </p>
        <p>In this therapy devised by Von Ardenne, glucose is injected
          into the blood stream. As a consequence, the cancer cell pH
          will drop eventually to the 5.5 range. The patient is then
          placed in a furnace heated to 104 degrees Fahrenheit for a
          matter of hr [23-25]. The older the patient, the fewer the
          number of hours. The patient is allowed to breathe cold air.
          Diathermy is also applied over the tumor area which, in the
          absence of a blood supply, will cause the temperature of the
          mass to rise to something over 106 degrees Fahrenheit. At
          these high temperatures and in the acid medium, the life of
          cancer cells is very short. The only drawback to the therapy
          is that a case of severe toxemia may result from the
          out-leakage of the acid toxins within the tumor masses
          [23-25]. </p>
        <p><b><i>The High pH Therapy</i></b> </p>
        <p>The ready uptake of cesium and rubidium by the cancer cells
          lead the writer to the High pH therapy. This consists of
          feeding the patient close to 6 g of CsCl or RbCl per day in
          conjunction with the administration of ascorbic and retionic
          acids, Vitamins C and A, which being weak acids, upon
          absorption by the tumor cells will enhance the negative
          potential gradient across the membrane, and also zinc and
          selenium salts which, when absorbed on the membrane surface,
          will act as broad and moderately strong electron donors. Both
          types of compounds have been shown in mice to drastically
          enhance the pickup for cesium and rubidium ions. </p>
        <p>The toxic dose for CsCl is 135 g. The administration of 6 g
          per day therefore has no toxic effects. It is sufficient
          however to give rise to the pH in the cancer cells, bringing
          them up in a few days to the 8 or above where the life of the
          cell is short. In addition, the presence of Cs and Rb salts in
          the body fluids neutralizes the acid toxins leaking out of the
          tumor mass and renders them nontoxic. <br>
          TESTS OF THE HIGH pH THERAPY ON MICE AND HUMANS <br>
          The therapy has been tested and the results will be discussed
          briefly below. </p>
        <p><b><i>Tests on Mice</i></b> </p>
        <p>The High pH therapy was first tested at American University
          in Washington, DC using mice. In these tests, 2 mm cubes of
          mammary tumors were implanted in the abdomens of mice and
          allowed to grow for 8 days. The mice were then </p>
        <p>divided into two groups. Both groups were continued on mouse
          chow, but the test group was given 1.11 g of rubidium
          carbonate by mouth per day in aqueous solution. After 13 more
          days the controls were starting to die so all mice were
          sacrificed and the tumors removed and weighed. The tumors in
          the test animals weighed only one eleventh of those in the
          controls. In addition, the test animals were showing none of
          the adverse effects of having cancer [3]. </p>
        <p>Results similar to those mentioned above were obtained at
          Platteville, WI using CsCl. More recently, Platteville has
          studied intraperitoneal injection of cesium carbonate for mice
          with abdominal tumor implants with 97% curative effect. </p>
        <p>Tests using intraperitoneal injections of CsCl were carried
          out by Messiha <i>et al</i>. [21]. The results were most
          successful and showed a drastic shrinkage in the tumor masses.
        </p>
        <p><b><i>Tests on Man</i></b> </p>
        <p>Many tests on humans have been carried out by H. Nieper in
          Hannover, Germany and by H. Sartori in Washington, DC as well
          as by a number of other physicians. On the whole, the results
          have been very satisfactory. It has been observed that all
          pains associated with cancer disappear within 12 to 24 hr,
          except in a very few cases where there was a morphine
          withdrawal problem that required a few more hours. In these
          tests 2 g doses of CsCl were administered three times per day
          after eating. In most cases 5 to 10 g of Vitamin C and 100,000
          units of Vitamin A, along with 50 to 100 mg of zinc, were also
          administered. Both Nieper and Sartori were also administering
          nitrilosides in the form of laetrile. There are good reasons
          to believe that the laetrile may be more effective than the
          vitamins in enhancing the pickup of cesium by the cells. </p>
        <p>In addition to the loss of pains, the physical results are a
          rapid shrinkage of the tumor masses. The material comprising
          the tumors is secreted as uric acid in the urine; the uric
          acid content of the urine increases many fold. About 50% of
          the patients were pronounced terminal, and were not able to
          work. Of these, a majority have gone back to work. </p>
        <p>Two side effects have been observed in some of the patients.
          These are first nausea, and the second diarrhea. Both depend
          upon the general condition of the digestive tract. Nieper
          feels that nausea can be prevented by administering the cesium
          in a solution of sorbitol. The diarrhea may, to some extent,
          be affected by the Vitamin C. </p>
        <p>Only one case history will be presented here. A woman with 2
          hard tumor masses 8 to 10 cm in diameter, one on her thyroid
          and one on her chest, was given 3 to 6 months to live. She had
          been subjected to chemotherapy, but was discontinued because
          it weakened her. She was taking laetrile on her own. She was
          given a 50 g bottle of CsCl and was told to take 4 g per day.
          She reported her case a year later. Being very frightened she
          took the entire 50 g in one week. At the end of that time the
          tumor masses were very soft, so she obtained another 50 g of
          CsCl and took it in another week. By the end of that time she
          could not find the tumors, and two years later there was no
          sign of their return. </p>
        <p><b>LOW INCIDENCE CANCER AREAS</b> </p>
        <p>There are a number of areas where the incidences of cancer
          are very low. Unfortunately, the food composition in these
          areas has never been analyzed. At the 1978 Stockholm
          Conference on Food and Cancer it was concluded that there is
          definitely a connection between the two, but since the
          relationship was not understood, no conclusions could be drawn
          [22]. The food intake has been studied by the author as far as
          possible from the high pH point of view. The results found
          will be discussed for a number of low incidence areas. </p>
        <p><b><i>The Hopi Indians of Arizona</i></b> </p>
        <p>The incidence of cancer among the Hopi Indians is 1 in 1000
          as compared to 1 in 4 for the USA as a whole. Fortunately
          their food has been analyzed from the standpoint of
          nutritional values [17]. In this study it was shown that the
          Hopi food runs higher in all the essential minerals than
          conventional foods. It is very high in potassium and
          exceptionally high in rubidium. Since the soil is volcanic it
          must also be very rich in cesium. These Indians live primarily
          on desert grown calico corn products. Instead of using baking
          soda they use the ash of chamisa leaves, a desert grown plant.
          The analyses of this ash showed it to be very rich in
          rubidium. The Indians also eat many fruits, especially
          apricots, per day. They always eat the kernels. The results
          indicate clearly that the Hopi food meets the requirements for
          the High pH therapy. </p>
        <p><b><i>The Pueblo Indians of Arizona</i></b> </p>
        <p>Some 20 years ago the incidence of cancer among the Pueblo
          Indians was the same as that for the Hopi Indians, since their
          food was essentially the same. But unlike the Hopi, these
          Indians have accrued certain items from outside their
          environment, hence supermarkets were installed in the area.
          Today the incidence of cancer among the Pueblos is 1 in 4, the
          same as the U.S. It is reported that there is a regular
          epidemic of cancer among them. It must be emphasized here that
          the high incidence of cancer is not due to what is in the
          supermarket foods, hut rather to what is not in it. It is
          essentially lacking rubidium and cesium and low in potassium.
        </p>
        <p><b><i>The Hunza of North Pakistan</i></b> </p>
        <p>Cancer is essentially unknown among the Hunza, but
          unfortunately their food has never been analyzed. Talks with
          Hunza themselves and with Hindu professors who have spent some
          time in the area, have thrown sufficient light upon the food
          intake to show that it meets the requirements of the High pH
          therapy. They are essentially vegetarians, and are great fruit
          eaters, eating ordinarily 40 apricots per day; they always eat
          the kernels, either directly or as a meal. They drink at least
          4 liters of mineral spring waters which abound in the area.
          Fortunately this water has been analyzed and found to be very
          rich in cesium. Since the soil is volcanic in nature, it must
          be concluded that it will be rich in Cs and Rb, as well as K.
        </p>
        <p><b><i>Central and South America</i></b> </p>
        <p>The Indians who live in Central America and on the highland
          of Peru and Equador have very low incidences of cancer. The
          soil in these areas is volcanic. Fruit from the areas has been
          obtained and analyzed for rubidium and cesium and found to run
          very high in both elements. Cases have been reliably reported
          where people with advance inoperable cancer have gone to live
          with these Indians, and found that all tumor masses disappear
          within a very few months. Clearly the food there meets the
          high pH requirements. </p>
        <p>In conclusion, the High pH therapy, as has been pointed out,
          was arrived at from physical experiments carried out on cancer
          and normal cells. It has been tested and found effective on
          cancers in both mice and humans. There can be no question that
          Cs and Rb salts, when present in the adjacent fluids, the pH
          of cancer cells will rise to the point where the life of the
          cell is short, and that they will also neutralize the acid
          toxins formed in the tumor mass and render them nontoxic. </p>

        <p><b><i>Cesium Dosage and Side Effects</i></b> </p>
        <p>Several problems have arisen in the therapy which require
          further study. One of these is to determine the minimal dosage
          of CsCl that will kill cancer cells. Would cesium carbonate be
          better? Related to this are the effectiveness of intravenous
          injections, and, in certain cases, intraperitoneal injections.
          Both have been found to be effective in mice, but they have
          not yet been tested on humans. </p>
        <p>The minimal dosage for curative action has not been
          determined. It has been observed by several physicians that
          the administration of 0.5 g per day of CsCl will actually
          enhance the rate of tumor growth. This is to be expected,
          since this low amount is sufficient only to raise the cell pH
          into the high mitosis range (see Chart 1). The data so far
          reveal that any quantity of 3.0 g or above will be effective.
        </p>
        <p>A side effect which occurs in some cases, especially those
          who have had stomach ulcers, is nausea. This is far smaller
          for 3.0 g per day than for 6 to 10 g. The nausea can be
          minimized by administering cesium salt in a sorbitol solution
          as mentioned earlier. Further studies are necessary. </p>
        <p>A limited number of patients have experienced diarrhea. Since
          cesium is a nerve stimulant [19], this can be expected. The
          effect is enhanced by taking large doses of Vitamin C, but it
          apparently is lowered by laetrile. </p>
        <p>A further study is being made to determine the amount of
          cesium, rubidium or possible potassium in the diet that is
          sufficient to prevent cancer. Some data is available on the
          food composition in areas of the world where cancer is very
          low, but it is difficult to quantify, since the amount eaten
          varies greatly between individuals. </p>
        <p>The effectiveness of potassium salts is yet to be determined.
          Tests to date have not been made on leukemia patients. </p>
        <p><b>CESIUM BIOLOGICAL USES</b> </p>
        <p>In addition to the cancer therapy outlined in this paper, a
          [19] U.S. Patent has been issued on the use of cesium chloride
          as a nerve stimulant. Cesium salts are very effective in
          regulating heart arrhythmia. In areas of the world where
          cesium in the food intake is high, it has been noted that
          longevity of well over 100 years is not at all uncommon. Based
          on experimental data available [21] Cs salts may be useful in
          the treatment of manic-depressives. </p>

        <div style="text-align: center;"><b>Cesium Science</b></div>
        <p>Almost 75 years ago, Otto Warburg was awarded two Nobel
          prizes for his theories that cancer is caused by impaired cell
          respiration due to a lack of oxygen at the cellular level.
          According to Warburg, damaged cell respiration causes
          fermentation, resulting in hyper-acidity at the cellular
          level. </p>
        <p>In 1984 Keith Brewer, PhD (Physics) translated Warburg's
          theories into a practical, cost efficient treatment protocol
          for cancer. Brewer successfully treated 30 patients with
          various cancers, using Cesium, nature's most alkaline mineral.
        </p>
        <p><b>The results of Brewer's work -- all 30 survived.</b> </p>
        <p>In 1996 Neal Deoul provided financing that enabled T-UP Inc.
          to become a primary distributor of Cesium and concentrated
          aloe vera. Hundreds of cancer patients experienced remarkable
          results using Cesium and T-UP aloe vera in their battles
          against cancer ... </p>
        <p>Over seventy-five years ago Dr. Otto Warburg published a
          Nobel Prize winning paper describing the environment of the
          cancer cell. A normal cell undergoes an adverse change when it
          can no longer take up oxygen to convert glucose into energy by
          oxidation. In the absence of oxygen the cell reverts to a
          primitive nutritional program to sustain itself, converting
          glucose, by fermentation. The lactic acid produced by
          fermentation lowers the cell pH (acid/alkaline balance) and
          destroys the ability of DNA and RNA to control cell division…
          the cancer cells begin to multiply unchecked. The lactic acid
          simultaneously causes intense local pain and destroys cell
          enzymes. Therefore, cancer appears as a rapidly growing outer
          cell mass with a core of dead cells. </p>
        <p>Cesium, a naturally occurring alkaline element has been shown
          to affect the cancer cell two ways. First, Cesium limits the
          cellular uptake of the nutrient glucose… starving the cancer
          cell and diminishing fermentation. Second, Cesium raises the
          cell pH to the range of 8.0 neutralizing the weak lactic acid
          and stopping pain within 12 to 24 hours. A pH range of 8.0 is
          a deadly environment for the cancer cell… the cancer cell dies
          within a few days and is absorbed and eliminated by the body.
        </p>
        <p><b>The science of High pH therapy (drastically changing the
            acid/alkaline balance of the cell):</b> </p>
        <p>By the late 1970's mass spectrographic and isotope studies
          had shown that tumor cells exhibit a preference for the uptake
          of certain alkaline minerals; Potassium, Rubidium, and
          especially Cesium. Further, specific antioxidants i.e. vitamin
          C, and Zinc were shown to enhance the uptake of these alkaline
          minerals by the cancer cell. </p>
        <p>A normal cell is surrounded by a membrane, which selectively
          allows materials to flow in and out. Oxygen and nutrients,
          such as glucose, flow in and the waste products of cellular
          chemistry flow out. The cells are protected by the immune
          system; a well functioning immune system is the best defense
          against the formation of cancer cells. When environmental
          toxins (carcinogens) overwhelm the immune system the entire
          program is compromised. The cell membrane is affected first,
          losing its ability to exchange oxygen (respiration); the cell
          then reverts to a primitive survival mechanism - fermentation.
          The newly formed (anaerobic) cancer cell cannot be repaired
          (fermentation is not reversible) the cell is now out of
          control and must be destroyed as rapidly as possible. </p>
        <p>Note that in areas of the world where there is a high Cesium
          content in the soil cancer is virtually unknown: Hopi Indians
          of Arizona, the Hunza of North Pakistan, and the Indians of
          Central and South America. This observation suggests the
          possibility of a vitamin, mineral, antioxidant formula
          containing Cesium in an amount equal to that found in the soil
          of cancer free habitats. This vitamin could be a powerful new
          tool to help slow down and even reverse the present cancer
          epidemic. </p>
        <p>Some possible side effects noted during Cesium therapy: </p>
        <p>Numbness within the triangle describing the mouth and the tip
          of the nose. <br>
          Nausea and/or flu like discomfort. </p>

        Abstract --- The invention relates to a process for recovering
        purified cesium chloride from a cesium aluminum silicate ore in
        which the ore is digested with aqueous hydrochloric acid and the
        silica solids removed to obtain an aqueous acidic digest
        solution of metal chlorides consisting principally of cesium
        chloride and aluminum chloride together with other metal
        chlorides, wherein the improvement comprises: (a) evaporating
        the water from said digest solution to obtain a solid phase
        mixture of metal chlorides, including cesium chloride and
        hydrated aluminum chloride; (b) heating said solid phase mixture
        at a temperature effective for converting the hydrated aluminum
        chloride to aluminum oxide without decomposing the cesium
        chloride; (c) extracting the resulting solids with water to
        obtain an aqueous extract of cesium chloride; and (d) separating
        the residual solids containing the aluminum oxide to produce a
        purified extract of cesium chloride.

        &nbsp;Abstract --- PURPOSE:To prevent formation and admixture of
        Rb salt without generating toxic gas at a time of reaction and
        to easily obtain high-purity CsCl by utilizing H2O2 as an
        oxidizing agent and utilizing hydrazinium salt as a reducing
        agent respectively and treating a hydrochloric acid-based soln.
        contg. Cs ions. CONSTITUTION:I2 powder equivalent to Cs is added
        to a 5-9 N hydrochloric acid-based soln. contg. Cs&lt;+&gt; such
        as Cs2CO3. Thereafter aqueous hydrogen peroxide having
        &gt;=30wt.% concn. of 1-1.7 equivalent to I2 is added. The soln.
        is agitated until I2 is extinguished while the temp. of the
        soln. is maintained at 30-40 deg.C. After CsICl2 is formed, the
        soln. is heated to rise the temp. and deposited crystal is
        dissolved. This soln. is left to cool and CsICl2 is deposited,
        separated and recovered. Then separated and recovered CsICl2 is
        mixed with the required amount of water. Hydrazinium salt is
        added while agitating the soln. until CsICl2 disappears and both
        I2 and CsCl soln. are produced. I2 is separated and the obtained
        CsCl soln. is heated and concentrated and thereafter left to
        cool. Further after adding acetone, this CsCl soln. is left to
        cool and deposited high- purity CsCl is separated and recovered.

        <p><b>Benefits of Cesium</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium is extremely Alkaline <br>
          Cesium is readily accepted into cancer cells <br>
          Cesium is toxic to cancer cells <br>
          Cesium both halts and neutralizes lactic acid <br>
          Lactic acid causes pain and is a source of energy/fuel for
          cancer <br>
          Cesium disrupts the ionic balance of cancer cells membrane <br>
          Cesium has been used for heart arrhythmia <br>
          Cesium is used as a nerve stimulant <br>
          Cesium has little adverse effect on normal cells </p>
        <p>Each bottle has 32 ounces which provides the recommended dose
          of 3 grams per day for 30 days of liquid cesium also included
          in the 32 oz bottle is the recommended dosage of potassium a
          day and DMSO </p>
        <p><i>Liquid Ionic Cesium</i> --- this form of Cesium has been
          shown to be very effective at killing cancer cells. Our Liquid
          Ionic Cesium Plus has Rubidium for the most effective tumor
          fighting compound available anywhere. </p>
        <p><b>Product Description</b> </p>
        <p>You may take the Cesium/potassium/Dmso orally or topically.
          Should you experience diahrea, take it topically until your
          digestive tract is fully normalized. Oral (by mouth) is the
          preferred method unless the tumors are near the surface of the
          skin. For tumors on or near the skin, applying the
          cesium/potassium/DMSO on the skin over the tumor would be most
          effective since it would maximize the dose directly on the
          tumor. Also, since the goal is to increase oxygen transport,
          it would be desirable to take MSM with the
          cesium/potassium/DMSO. MSM is the oxidized form of DMSO and
          dissolving it into the DMSO would increase the immediate
          transport of oxygen to the tumor. Take topically if you
          develop gastric issues such as diahrrea. </p>
        <p><i>Oral Instructions </i>--- Start with 1 to 2 ounces of
          fresh squeezed citrus juice, add 2 tablespoons of organic
          apple cider vinegar and add 1 tablespoon of the
          cesium/potassium combo. The cesium and potassium are very
          alkali and you must have the citrus juice and the apple cider
          vinegar to neutralize the Ph in the stomach. It is also
          advised that you take a supplement containing betaine
          hydrochloride. </p>
        <p><i>Topical Instructions </i>--- Rub 1 tablespoon directly
          into the top of feet, wrist and the neck are all good
          locations to apply. Rub in thoroughly. </p>
        <p>Every cell in the body is like a little battery. To
          successfully bring nourishment in, and take poisons out, it
          has to be fully charged. In a cancerous cell, the charge
          (called cell voltage) drops from 90 millivolts to less than 40
          millivolts. When the cell voltage gets to the very bottom,
          only 5 substances can pass in or out of the cell. They are
          water, sugar, potassium, cesium and rubidium. </p>
        <p>Potassium transports glucose into cells for metabolism while
          calcium transports oxygen. The amount of calcium in cancer
          cells is only about one percent of that in normal cells. This
          means that glucose can readily enter cancer cells but that
          oxygen cannot. This accounts for the anaerobic state of cancer
          cells pointed out by Warburg as early as 1925. Due to the lack
          of oxygen in a cancer cell, the only means of metabolism for
          it is the anaerobic phase of the Krebs cycle. This is very
          inefficient and calls for lots of glucose, as very little of
          the potential energy of the glucose is actually converted to
          energy (ATP), most of the glucose gets converted to lactic
          acid. Thus cancer has a voracious appetite for glucose and
          does not have enough energy to function as does a healthy cell
          which is capable of extracting nearly all of the potential
          energy from not only glucose but protein and fats as well. </p>
        <p>Every cell (normal &amp; cancer) depends on "Sodium-Potassium
          (Na-K) Pumps" embedded in the cell wall to maintain the
          required ionic balance/distribution across the cell wall as
          well as shuttle blood glucose into the cell for metabolism.
          The pumps work to get potassium ions into the cell and sodium
          ions out, creating a condition where the concentration of
          potassium is high in the cell and low outside and the reverse
          is true of sodium, which is kept low in the cell and is high
          outside. </p>
        <p>A disruption of this delicate ionic balance across the cell
          wall will kill the cell. As one example, some bacteria kill
          cells by drilling holes in the membrane and inserting a tube
          that allows free diffusion of ions in both directions. This
          disrupts the sodium-potassium concentration separation to the
          point of killing the cell. Cesium, like sodium and potassium,
          is a Group 1 element as listed in the periodic table. Because
          cesium is closely related to potassium, it too can enter into
          a cancer cell by the same mechanism as potassium does. It
          readily substitutes for potassium in the biochemical
          processes. As the cesium ions accumulate in the cell they
          cancel the potential gradient across the cell wall that is
          required to energize the sodium-glucose co-transport into the
          cell. This could happen quite quickly requiring only a modest
          concentration of cesium in the cell. This rapid arresting of
          the cancer growth is consistent with the common reports that
          once cesium treatment is initiated, the first thing that
          happens is all the pain goes away. If this is all true, it
          would seem that treatment of cancer with cesium, to quickly
          arrest growth and then gradually kill the cells, is an almost
          perfect approach. It would be consistent with some of the
          amazing reports of late stage cancer being arrested in a
          matter of days. </p>
        <p>As the cell continues to ingest both cesium and potassium,
          the effects to the cancer cell are toxic. Not only is the
          ionic balance disrupted, but the cesium will exit the cancer
          cell very slowly and it is so alkali that it is toxic to the
          cancer cell. One of the first effects of the Cesium is the
          cancer cell is very quickly starved of glucose. The cell stops
          growing and will eventually be unable to function. Since the
          cesium exits the cell only very slowly, this effect lasts long
          after the cesium treatment has ceased. In time, the starved
          cancer cells then die off. </p>
        <p>The Bohr Effect is a property of hemoglobin first described
          by the Danish physiologist Christian Bohr in 1904. Because of
          the Bohr effect, an increase in blood carbon dioxide level, a
          decrease in pH or increased temperature causes hemoglobin to
          bind to oxygen with less affinity. </p>
        <p>The Bohr effect utilizes carbon dioxide to displace oxygen.
          No carbon oxide, no oxygen displacement from the hemoglobin.
          Normal cells produce carbon dioxide but cancer cells don?t. It
          happens that lactic acid also affects the blood?s oxygen
          affinity, though not as strongly as carbon dioxide. However,
          lactic acid doesn?t vaporize as the blood passes through the
          lungs, so its effect on the lungs? ability to oxygenate the
          blood is the opposite of the easily exchangeable carbon
          dioxide?s. Besides dissociating oxygen from hemoglobin,
          lactate also displaces carbon dioxide from its (carbamino)
          binding sites on hemoglobin. </p>
        <p>In the presence of cancer then we find low to non existent
          levels of carbon dioxide but high levels of lactic acid. The
          lactic acid doesn?t just displace oxygen but carbon dioxide as
          well. The displaced carbon dioxide once dumped at the tumor
          site only servers to make the site more acidic. To make
          matters worse, when the lactic acid laden blood gets to the
          lungs it stays in the blood and the hemoglobin can?t get a
          fresh supply of oxygen. Without adequate oxygen, not only does
          the cancer have ideal conditions but the rest of the body
          suffers from hypoxia or low oxygen. Cesium raises the cancer
          cell pH enough to effectively neutralize the weak lactic acid.
        </p>
        <p>Many tests on humans have been carried out by H. Nieper in
          Hannover, Germany and by H. Sartori in Washington, DC as well
          as by a number of other physicians. On the whole, the results
          have been very satisfactory. It has been observed that all
          pains associated with cancer disappear within 12 to 24 hr,
          except in a very few cases where there was a morphine
          withdrawal problem that required a few more hours. In these
          tests 2 g doses of CsCl were administered three times per day
          after eating. In most cases 5 to 10 g of Vitamin C and 100,000
          units of Vitamin A, along with 50 to 100 mg of zinc, were also
          administered. Both Nieper and Sartori were also administering
          nitrilosides in the form of laetrile. There are good reasons
          to believe that the laetrile may be more effective than the
          vitamins in enhancing the pickup of cesium by the cells. </p>
        <p>In addition to the loss of pains, the physical results are a
          rapid shrinkage of the tumor masses. The material comprising
          the tumors is secreted as uric acid in the urine; the uric
          acid content of the urine increases many fold. About 50% of
          the patients were pronounced terminal, and were not able to
          work. Of these, a majority have gone back to work. </p>
        <p>Luckily, healthy cells are not affected by cesium because
          they use much less glucose than cancer, normal aerobic cells
          thrive in higher alkaline environments and their cell voltage
          allows them to balance themselves. </p>
        <p>In addition to the cancer therapy, a U.S. Patent has been
          issued on the use of cesium as a nerve stimulant and Cesium is
          very effective in regulating heart arrhythmia. In areas of the
          world where cesium in the food intake is high, it has been
          noted that longevity of well over 100 years is not at all
          uncommon. Based on experimental data available Cesium may also
          be useful in the treatment of manic-depressives. </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride taken for cancer will cause plasma potassium
          depletion. Therefore, it becomes necessary to supplement with
          potassium. There should be ample potassium in the
          Cesium/Potassium/DMSO Combo offered by NUTRITION 2000 when the
          cancer diet is followed. It is a good idea and recommended
          that you monitor blood levels of potassium and strive to keep
          the potassium in the upper normal range. You will not have a
          problem with excess levels of potassium if you are not
          suffering from acute kidney failure. </p>
        <p>MSM is simply the oxidized state of DMSO and the two form an
          equilibrium in the blood that shifts towards MSM in the lungs,
          a more oxidizing environment, and shifts towards DMSO in the
          body cells, a more reducing environment. In the process oxygen
          is delivered to the cells. The process is continually repeated
          providing a continuous flow of oxygen to the cells that is
          independent of hemoglobin. In order for cancer to grow, it
          must have an environment void of oxygen. Another reason for
          adding DMSO is that it will allow the topical use of cesium
          should there be any GI distress when the cesium is taken
          orally. </p>
        <p>NUTRITION 2000 offers liquid ionic cesium with potassium and
          DMSO. It is also advised to add high dose vitamin C (5,000 to
          10,000 mg?s per day), Alpha Lipoic acid, MSM, selenium and
          vitamin E (full array of tocopherols not just alpha) to the
          Cesium/Potassium/DMSO combination. Please do not take cesium
          without talking with one of our consultants. Cesium is
          powerful and must be taken under supervision. </p>
        <p><b>In Depth Review of Cesium</b> </p>
        <p><b>Cesium for Cancer</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium Chloride, a crystalline salt&nbsp; has been used
          successfully for cancer for many years now.&nbsp; Cesium
          Chloride works by raising the cancer cell's&nbsp; Ph to a
          highly alkaline state.&nbsp; Although many anti-cancer diets
          also produce an alkaline state, they simply cannot do so as
          quickly or as fully as Cesium Chloride can. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          -----------6.5---------------------7.35---------7.5--------- </p>
        <p>Cells, whether cancerous or normal can only live and
          reproduce (undergo mitosis) in a Ph range of between 6.5 and
          7.5.&nbsp; A healthy cell has a Ph of 7.35 while a cancer cell
          is more acidic.&nbsp; Cesium Chloride when taken orally will
          raise the Ph of cancer cells, but not that of normal
          cells.&nbsp; When the Ph of a cell goes above 7.5 it dies and
          if it goes above 8.0 it will die in a matter of hours. </p>
        <p><b>What can enter a cancer Cell</b> </p>
        <p>Every cell in the body is like a little battery.&nbsp; To
          successfully bring nourishment in, and take poisons out, it
          has to be fully charged.&nbsp; In a cancerous cell, the charge
          (called cell voltage) drops from 90 millivolts to less than 40
          millivolts.&nbsp; When the cell voltage gets to the very
          bottom, only 5 substances can pass in or out of the
          cell.&nbsp; They are water, sugar, potassium, cesium and
          rubidium.&nbsp; Oxygen cannot enter into a cancer cell.&nbsp;
          So you see, even if there is a lot of oxygen in the blood, it
          won't get into the cell.&nbsp; Cesium, because of its
          electrical properties can still enter the cancerous
          cell.&nbsp; When it does so, because of its extreme
          alkalinity, the cell dies.&nbsp; Luckily, healthy cells are
          not affected by cesium because their cell voltage allows them
          to balance themselves.&nbsp; The only side effect is a loss of
          potassium which can be remedies with eating a few bananas or
          potatoes. </p>
        <p>It is interesting to note that cancer is virtually unknown
          among the Hopi Indians of Arizona and the Hunza of Northern
          Pakistan, so long as they stay in the same environment.&nbsp;
          This strongly suggests that something they are consuming is
          protecting them from cancer.&nbsp; The Hopi water is rich in
          Rubidium and potassium.&nbsp; The Hunza water is rich in
          Cesium and potassium, making both of the water supplies rich
          with very caustically (alkaline) active metals. </p>
        <p>In his publication, Cesium therapy in cancer patients, Dr.
          Sartori describes the 2 week treatment of 50 last stage,
          metastasized, terminal cancer patients&nbsp; (13 comatose),
          with Cesium chloride salts.&nbsp; All were expected to die
          within weeks, with the survival rate being less than one in
          ten million.&nbsp; After 2 weeks, 13 died with autopsies
          showing no presence of cancer.&nbsp; After 12 months, 12 more
          had died, but 25, an astounding 50% survived. </p>

        <p>Certain foods contain biologically active compounds and/or
          ingredients, i.e., vitamins inorganic salts, organic
          compounds; essential fatty acids, minerals, and chelating
          agents which may either precipitate or prevent cancer
          development.&nbsp; The relationship between dietary
          consumption and cancer development is not clear and further
          investigation continues.&nbsp; Noteworthy is the report on the
          presence of high levels of cesium [Cs] and rubidium [Rb] in
          food along with availability of various supportive compounds
          as vitamins A and C, along with zinc and selenium in diet of
          populations residing in areas with low incidence of cancer
          e.g., the Hopi Indian territory in Arizona, the Hunza area in
          North Pakistan, and the volcanic regions of Brazil.&nbsp; The
          diet of these populations is similar to the nutritive
          requirements for the high Ph cancer therapy developed by
          Brewer subsequent series of physical experiments with cancer
          cells.&nbsp; In these tests the presence of Cs+ or Rb+ in the
          adjacent fluids of the tumor cell is believed to raise the Ph
          of the cancer cell where mitosis will cease resulting in
          reduction of life span of the cancer cell.&nbsp; The
          introduction of such alkaline Ph by these alkali salts may
          also neutralize the acidic and toxic material within the
          cancer cell.&nbsp; This report combines the use of CsCl with
          various supportive agents. Which have been hypothesized both
          to enhance the entry of Cs+ into the cancer cell and to
          stimulate the immune response, in the treatment of various
          cancers. </p>
        <p><b>Method</b> </p>
        <p>Treatment was performed on 50 patients during the last three
          years at Life Sciences Universal Medical Clinics in Rockville
          MD and in Washington D.C.&nbsp; All patients were terminal
          subjects with generalized metastatic disease.&nbsp;
          Forty-seven of the 50 patient?s studies had received maximal
          modalities of treatment, i.e., surgery, radiation, and various
          chemotherapy, before metabolic Cs-treatment was
          initiated.&nbsp; Three patients were comatose and 14 of the
          patients were considered terminal due to previous treatments
          outcome and cancer complications.&nbsp; The type of cancer of
          the patients studied and their number is detailed in table 1.
        </p>
        <p>The Cs-treatment was given in conjunction of other supportive
          compounds under diet control in addition to the utilization of
          specific compounds to produce adequate circulation and
          oxygenation.&nbsp; According to individual cases CsCl was
          given at daily dosages of 6 to 9 grams in 3 equally divided
          doses, with vitamin A-emulsion (100,000 to 300,000 U), vitamin
          C (4 to 30 grams), zinc (80 to 100 mg) selenium (600 to 1,200
          mcg) and amygdalin (1,500 mg) in addition to other
          supplementations according to the specific needs of the
          patient.&nbsp; The diet consisted mainly of whole grains,
          vegetables, linolenic acid rich oils (linseed, walnut, soy,
          wheat germ) and other supplemental food.&nbsp; To increase
          efficiency of the treatment and improve the circulation and
          oxygenation, the patients received the chelating agent EDTA,
          dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and also a combination of vitamins, K
          and Mg salts. </p>
        <p><b>Results</b> </p>
        <p>Table 1 summarizes the results of the Cs-treatment of 50
          cancer patients studied over 3 years.&nbsp; They had
          generalized metastatic disease, except for 3 patients.&nbsp;
          Initial death occurrences fir the initial 2 week treatment was
          in the same order and magnitude of these recorded for the 12
          month period.&nbsp;&nbsp; The percent of survival of breast,
          colon, prostate, pancreas, and lung cancer accounted to
          approximately, 50% recovery which was higher than that noted
          for liver cancer and the lymphoma patients treated.&nbsp; An
          overall 50% recovery from cancer by the Cs-therapy was
          determined in the 50 patients treated.&nbsp; Data from the
          autopsy made indicated the absence of tumors in patient dying
          within 14 days of the Cs-treatment.&nbsp; One of the most
          striking effects of the treatment was the disappearance of
          pain in all patients within 1 to 3 days after initiation of
          the Cs-therapy. </p>
        <p>These studies were performed under my direction, initiated in
          April, 1981.&nbsp; Twenty-eight patients were initially
          treated with CsCl between April, 1981 to October, 1982.&nbsp;
          They were subjected to various cancer therapies, e.g.,
          surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, and were considered
          terminal cases with metastatic disease except for 3 patients
          who were not previously treated.&nbsp; Three patients were
          comatose at the time of the Cs treatment.&nbsp; Thirteen
          patients died within less than 2 weeks of treatment.&nbsp;
          Each patient showed a reduction in tumor mass by the
          Cs-treatment.&nbsp; Of the breast cancer patients, the most
          impressive effect was seen n a female patient who was comatose
          at the beginning of the Cs-treatment and was considered a
          terminal case.&nbsp; The Cs-therapy, with other ingredients
          used, was immediately instituted by nasogastric route because
          there was no cooperation from the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
          daily CsCl dose given amounted to 30 grams, 10 grams given 3
          times daily.&nbsp; The patient was able to leave after 5 days
          of treatment.&nbsp; However the patient's fall on the floor
          resulted in complications, i.e., fracture of the neck, and
          death.&nbsp; The autopsy revealed that the cancer metastasis
          had essentially eaten away her hip bone causing this tragic
          accident.&nbsp; The autopsy performed also showed the presence
          of very little cancer tissue. </p>
        <p>The next most frequent cancer treated was of unknown
          primary.&nbsp; Treatment of 8 cases showed a death rate of 2
          within 14 days of treatment and an additional 2 deaths within
          12 months while 4 of the patients are still living.&nbsp; In
          one case, an autopsy was made in a patient after one week of
          Cs-treatment and showed a complete disappearance of the
          cancer.&nbsp; There were 7 cases of colon cancer patients who
          were treated with CsCl.&nbsp; Two of these patients died
          within 14 days, one of the patients had previous massive
          chemotherapy, and little time was available to restore her
          metabolic condition.&nbsp; The previous existing infiltration
          of the abdominal wall disappeared.&nbsp; However, no consent
          was given for an autopsy. </p>
        <p>In one lymphoma case the patient displayed an unusually large
          abdomen which was hard and he weighed approximately 250
          pounds.&nbsp; The massively enlarged abdomen began to decline
          in volume, i.e., a loss of approximately 120 pounds of body
          weight was noted after 3 months of the Cs- therapy.&nbsp; The
          spleen which was originally maximally enlarged and reaching
          into the pelvis was reduced to almost normal size.&nbsp; The
          liver position was down to about the level of the umbilicus
          and was also reduced to normal size in 3 months.&nbsp; The
          patient is still living after 3 years after his
          discharge.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no follow-p on this
          patient and he is being maintained on chemotherapy. </p>
        <p><b>Discussion</b> </p>
        <p>The results presented demonstrate the rate of efficacy of
          CsCl in cancer therapy.&nbsp; The total 50 cancer cases
          studied show an impressive 50% survival rate.&nbsp; This
          confirms the work of Messiha reported in these proceedings
          showing that the higher the dose it is, the more effective it
          seems to be.&nbsp;&nbsp; The autopsy obtained from the patient
          whose death was attributed to traumatic fracture of the neck,
          indicated that cancer had been initially further advanced
          resulting in bone destruction.&nbsp; However, the absence of
          cancer after the massive CsCl dose used in this case is
          demonstrable of the Cs-therapy.&nbsp; It appears that both
          dosages, i.e., as much as 30 grams/day and route of drug
          administration, i.e., nasogastric pathway, might have
          contributed to the patient?s rapid recovery.&nbsp; It should
          be noted, however, that CsCl dose regimens should no exceed 20
          to 40 grams due to side effects, mainly nausea, and
          diarrhea.&nbsp; The author?s personal experience with CsCl
          after an acute dose of 40 prams CsCl indicate that extensive
          nausea and parethesia around the mouth are the major side
          effects.&nbsp; This is probably due to K depletion.&nbsp; The
          usual dose used in the clinic ranges from 2 to 3 grams given
          by mouth 3 times daily.&nbsp; At a later time, at which time
          there is no indication of cancer presence, the CsCl dosage
          will be reduced to a preventative dose between .5 and 1 gram a
          day. </p>
        <p>The lymphoma case presented shows that CsCl efficiently
          reduced massive enlargements of spleen and liver as well as
          maximal ascites, causing an abdominal configuration of a
          tight, hard hemisphere, to almost normalize after 3 months of
          therapy.&nbsp; This period of time was required to eliminate
          such a massive volume resulting in the reduction of the body
          weight noted. </p>
        <p>The clinical efficacy of CsCl high pH metabolic therapy is
          best demonstrated by a recent case of primary liver cancer
          (not included in the 50 cases reported in this study).&nbsp;
          The patient was a 39 year old female teacher who was
          terminal.&nbsp; She was brought on a stretcher on April 25,
          1984 with a large liver tumor extending approximately 3 cm
          below the umbilical level.&nbsp; The treatment was then
          immediately instituted.&nbsp; This consisted of administration
          of CsCl, Beta-carotene, Vitamin C, Zn, Se, Mn, Cr, and K salts
          by the oral route in addition to concomitant massive IV doses
          of ascorbate, K, Mg, Zn, Cn, Mn, Cr salts, B complex vitamins,
          folic acid, DMSO and heparin.&nbsp; After 5 consecutive
          treatment regimens EDTA was introduced to the therapy and the
          minerals present in the solution were discontinued.&nbsp; On
          May 10, 1984, the patient was discharged, returned home
          walking without assistance and displaying a smile on her
          face.&nbsp; The liver tumor had shrunk to 5 cm above the
          umbilicus.&nbsp;&nbsp; The determination of alphafetoprotein
          (AFP), a specific marker for liver cancer, rare embronal
          cancer and teratomas, decreased from the unusually high value
          of 39,000 units, compared to normal levels of 13 units,
          measured before initiation of Cs-therapy, to 5000 units
          obtained on the last day of treatment. </p>
        <p>The mechanism of action of Cs in cancer has been little
          studied.&nbsp; Both Cs+ and Rb+ can specifically enter the
          cancer cells and embryonic cells, but not normal adult cells
          have been demonstrated by Brewer.&nbsp; The cancer cells
          contain high amounts of hydrogen ions rendering them acidic
          and they also contain high Na+ levels than found in normal
          cells.&nbsp; If Cs+ or Rb+ can enter the cancer cells then the
          pH increases from as low as 5.5 to over pH 7.0.&nbsp; At a pH
          of 7.6 the cancer cell division will stop, at a pH of 8.0 to
          8.5 the lifespan of it is considerably shortened (only
          hours).&nbsp; In one case, the author has observed the
          shrinkage of metastases of breast cancer after one hour of
          Cs-treatment.&nbsp; Two days later wrinkles of the skin
          appeared where the tumor was present.&nbsp; In another case of
          a colon cancer with massive metastasis, of massive
          infiltration of the abdominal wall, liver and other tissues,
          seemed to have been reduced within 24 hours and continuing
          rapidly until the demise of the patient on the 14th day of the
          Cs-treatment. </p>
        <p>The uric acid levels measured at the onset of treatment was
          approximately 3.5 units which were increased to over 20 units,
          suggesting massive breakdowns of DNA, which produces the uric
          acid output.&nbsp; Therefore, destruction of nuclear acids, as
          reflected by a significant rise in the uric acid, may be used
          as a predictive measurement for treatment outcome.&nbsp; The
          failure of uric acid elevation may be indicative of lack of
          destruction of cancer cells.&nbsp; This has proven to be a
          very consistent finding in our clinic. </p>
        <p>There are certain factors which may enhance the
          Cs-therapy.&nbsp; The Cs-penetration into the cancer cells can
          be increased by the following three methods:&nbsp; The first
          approach resides in broadening the electron donor capacity of
          the cancer cell membrane by the application of cyanide, an
          electron donor radical as found in nitriles (amygdalin,
          Laetrile, mandelonitrite, prunasin, ficin, cassivin), by
          selenium oxide, an electron donor radical, or by the use of
          DMSO.&nbsp; The second approach enhances the potential
          gradient across the cancer cell membrane by the utilization of
          weak acids like ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) and retinoic acid
          (Vitamin A).&nbsp; The third method attempts to improve the
          circulation to the tumor and facilitate the destruction of
          cross-linkages in the mucoid and fibrinous substances around
          the cancer cell.&nbsp; This can be achieved by chelation
          therapy, i.e., the use of EDTA as has been shown by Blumer who
          reported on the reduction of cancer incidence by 90% by
          chelating patients (an average of 15 chelations in 8 years).
          This approach also reduced cardiovascular disease by
          50%.&nbsp; Other chelating agents can also be used.&nbsp;
          Moreover, the use of beta-carotene will lead to decomposition
          of blocking mucoid proteins mediated by electrical charges;
          also, heparin, which acts through electrical charges, will
          inactivate the immune repelling and immune binding capacities
          of the blocking mucoid proteins.&nbsp; These approaches will
          hinder cancer growth and they are virtually atoxic. </p>
        <p><b>The High pH Therapy</b> </p>
        <p>The ready uptake of cesium and rubidium by the cancer cells
          lead the writer to the High pH therapy. This consists of
          feeding the patient close to 6 g of CsCl or RbCl per day in
          conjunction with the administration of ascorbic and retionic
          acids, Vitamins C and A, which being weak acids, upon
          absorption by the tumor cells will enhance the negative
          potential gradient across the membrane, and also zinc and
          selenium salts which, when absorbed on the membrane surface,
          will act as broad and moderately strong electron donors. Both
          types of compounds have been shown in mice to drastically
          enhance the pickup for cesium and rubidium ions. </p>
        <p>The toxic dose for CsCl is 135 g. The administration of 6 g
          per day therefore has no toxic effects. It is sufficient
          however to give rise to the pH in the cancer cells, bringing
          them up in a few days to the 8 or above where the life of the
          cell is short. In addition, the presence of Cs and Rb salts in
          the body fluids neutralizes the acid toxins leaking out of the
          tumor mass and renders them nontoxic. </p>
        <p>Many tests on humans have been carried out by H. Nieper in
          Hannover, Germany and by H. Sartori in Washington, DC as well
          as by a number of other physicians. On the whole, the results
          have been very satisfactory. It has been observed that all
          pains associated with cancer disappear within 12 to 24 hr,
          except in a very few cases where there was a morphine
          withdrawal problem that required a few more hours. In these
          tests 2 g doses of CsCl were administered three times per day
          after eating. In most cases 5 to 10 g of Vitamin C and 100,000
          units of Vitamin A, along with 50 to 100 mg of zinc, were also
          administered. Both Nieper and Sartori were also administering
          nitrilosides in the form of laetrile. There are good reasons
          to believe that the laetrile may be more effective than the
          vitamins in enhancing the pickup of cesium by the cells. </p>
        <p>In addition to the loss of pains, the physical results are a
          rapid shrinkage of the tumor masses. The material comprising
          the tumors is secreted as uric acid in the urine; the uric
          acid content of the urine increases many fold. About 50% of
          the patients were pronounced terminal, and were not able to
          work. Of these, a majority have gone back to work. </p>
        <p>Two side effects have been observed in some of the patients.
          These are first nausea, and the second diarrhea. Both depend
          upon the general condition of the digestive tract. Nieper
          feels that nausea can be prevented by administering the cesium
          in a solution of sorbitol. The diarrhea may, to some extent,
          be affected by the Vitamin C. </p>
        <p>Only one case history will be presented here. A woman with 2
          hard tumor masses 8 to 10 cm in diameter, one on her thyroid
          and one on her chest, was given 3 to 6 months to live. She had
          been subjected to chemotherapy, but was discontinued because
          it weakened her. She was taking laetrile on her own. She was
          given a 50 g bottle of CsCl and was told to take 4 g per day.
          She reported her case a year later. Being very frightened she
          took the entire 50 g in one week. At the end of that time the
          tumor masses were very soft, so she obtained another 50 g of
          CsCl and took it in another week. By the end of that time she
          could not find the tumors, and two years later there was no
          sign of their return. </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride and a high pH diet cause potassium depletion.
          Therefore, it becomes necessary to supplemented with
          potassium. Most potassium supplements supply 100 mg of
          potassium. One banana supplies 500 mg of potassium. </p>
        <p>Proponents of cesium chloride suggest a dosage of 1-6 g/day.
          Most patients take 3 g a day always with food. Here is the
          schedule that Neal Deoul used: </p>
        <p>Breakfast: <br>
          Cesium chloride (1 gram) <br>
          Vitamin C (1000 milligrams) <br>
          Zinc (25 - 30 milligrams) <br>
          one potassium capsule as prescribed by a physician </p>
        <p>Lunch: <br>
          Vitamin C (1000 milligrams) </p>
        <p>Dinner: <br>
          Cesium chloride (1 gram) <br>
          Vitamin C (1000 milligrams) </p>
        <p>Before bed after eating 2 slices of bread: <br>
          Cesium chloride (1 gram) <br>
          Vitamin C (1000 milligrams) </p>
        <p>The minimal dosage for curative action has not been
          determined. It has been observed by several physicians that
          the administration of .5 g per day of CsCl will actually
          enhance the rate of tumor growth. This is to be expected,
          since this low amount is sufficient only to raise the cell pH
          into the high mitosis range. The data so far reveal that any
          quantity of 3.0 g or above will be effective. </p>
        <p>People who change their eating habits greatly increase the
          effectiveness of the supplements they take. </p>
        <p><b>Side Effects</b> </p>
        <p>In a small number of people, Cesium Chloride has been linked
          with ventricular tachycardia, a rapid and irregular heartbeat
          that can lead to sudden cardiac death. </p>
        <p>A side effect which occurs in some cases, especially those
          who have had stomach ulcers, is nausea. This side effect
          occurs far less often with the 3.0 g per day dose than for 6.0
          g dose which is recommended by some of the more aggressive
          therapists. </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride and a high pH diet cause potassium depletion.
          Therefore, it becomes necessary to supplemented with
          potassium. Most potassium supplements supply 100 mg of
          potassium. One banana supplies 500 mg of potassium. We offer a
          liquid containing cesium chloride with potassium in a balanced
          formula. Cesium chloride stays in the body for a couple of
          months after discinuation of use. For that reason a person
          should continue potassium supplementation for a couple of
          months after discinuation of cesium chloride. </p>
        <p><b>The Toxin Approach:</b> </p>
        <p>The second approach employs the use of toxins that do kill
          the cancer cells by a toxic effect. There are many examples of
          this. However, in my analysis of the mechanism of ionic cesium
          (cesium chloride), combined with increased potassium
          (potassium chloride) intake, I was extremely surprised to
          discover the real mechanism by which it operates and identify
          how truly profound it is. I concluded the mechanism presented
          to date on the internet was totally wrong and serously obsured
          the true potential of this appraoch. My present conclusion is
          that it stands out from all other such toxin approaches as
          being almost the perfect solution. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;Briefly, the cesium ions are taken into the cell via
          the sodium-potassium pump, substituting for potassium, and are
          trapped there. Not only are the cesium ions trapped, but they
          also block the exit of the potassium ions by blocking the
          potassium channel proteins in the cell walls. The accumulation
          of cesium and potassium ions in the cell negates the voltage
          potential across the cell membrane. This voltage potential is
          required to energize the sodium-glucose co-transport system
          that feeds the cell. The cell thus starves. There would also
          be an accumulation of ions in the cell which will cause the
          cells to swell, due to osmotic pressure, and possibly burst. </p>
        <p>This is true for all cells. Why are cancer cells impacted far
          faster/greater than normal cells? The sodium-potassium pump,
          energized by ATP, pumps two potassium ions into the cell while
          pumping three sodium ions out. This creates a charge imbalance
          that would stop the pump unless there was another path by
          which the sodium ions reenter. That happens via the
          sodium-glucose co-transport system in the cell membrane. Thus,
          the rate that the sodium-potassium operates is dictated by the
          glucose requirement of the cell. Cancer cells, which are
          anaerobic, require 20 times more glucose than normal cells to
          obtain the same amount of energy. Therefore, their
          sodium-potassium pumps operate 20 times faster than normal
          cells. Thus, they will pump cesium into their cells 20 times
          faster than normal cells, and will experience starvation (and
          bursting) 20 times faster. </p>
        <p>Since not only are the cesium ions trapped, but also
          potassium ions, this will result in a serious lowering of
          potassium in the blood which must be compensated for, which is
          easy to do. If it isn't, the lowering of the potassium level
          in the blood could cause death. I should mention that "Salt
          Substitute" available in every grocery store is potassium
          chloride and is a good, convenient source of potassium. </p>
        <p>The trick is to establish a protocol where the cancer cells
          enter starvation and stop the treatment before the normal
          cells follow. Cesium eventually exits the cells, but very
          slowly. Thus, once the cancer cells have entered starvation,
          treatment can stop and the cancer cells will continue to
          starve for an extended period of time. </p>
        <p>An additional feature of this approach is that the cancer
          cells are abruptly deprived of glucose, abruptly arresting
          their progression, but not necessarily resulting in an abrupt
          die-off. One might expect this to be more gradual than other
          cancer treatments. Thus there is a lower risk of experiencing
          severe toxic effects due to rapid cell die-off of cells common
          to other treatment approaches. </p>
        <p>As broadly reported on the internet, cesium chloride has been
          used successfully to treat cancer. My contribution is to
          discover its correct mechanism, described above. This should
          not only enhance its scientific credibility, but help
          researchers and treatment clinics optimize its use. </p>
        <p>Otto Warburg found that all cancer cells are anaerobic, and
          both of these approaches work on the anaerobic nature of
          cancer cells. Logically, the combination of the two should be
          effective for all forms of cancer. Will it be enough? Only
          time will tell if this dream will come true. </p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Pharmacology</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium, a naturally occurring alkaline element has been shown
          to change the cancer cell in two ways: </p>
        <p>Cesium limits the cellular uptake of glucose, which starves
          the cancer cell and reduces fermentation. </p>
        <p>It raises the cell pH to approximately 8.0. This neutralizes
          the weak lactic acid and stops pain within 12 to 24 hours. A
          pH range of 8.0 is a deadly environment for the cancer cell,
          which dies within a few days and is absorbed and eliminated by
          the body. </p>
        <p><b>A Different Theory</b> </p>
        <p>Another theory regarding the operation of cesium chloride is
          that it selectively targets tumor cells because many or most
          types are anaerobic. Anaerobic cells need times more glucose
          than normal cells. In order to get more glucose into the
          cancer cells, the sodium-potassium (Na-K) pumps on the cell
          wall must run 20 times faster, pumping more sodium out and
          more potassium in. Cesium acts like potassium so the Na-K pump
          brings lots of it into the cells. However once in the cell,
          cesium cannot get out, because it blocks the potassium
          channels through which potassium usually leaves. Cesium
          buildup then kills the cell by uncertain mechanisms. From
          "Proposed Common Cause and Cure for All Forms of Cancer" by
          David Gregg Ph.D. </p>
        <p><b>Effectiveness</b> </p>
        <p>There is no information that suggests that Cesium chloride is
          less effective on one type of cancer than another. </p>
        <p><b>A Fifty patient Study with Cesium Chloride Plus Other
            Supplements</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride treatment combined with other alternative
          treatments was performed on 50 patients at Life Science
          Universal Medical Center Clinics in Rockville, MD and in
          Washington, DC. From April 1981 to February 1984, 50 cancer
          patients were treated with Cesium chloride and given a special
          diet. All of the patients were terminal with generalized
          metastatic disease. 47 of the 50 patients had received maximum
          surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy before the metabolic
          regime was started. 3 patients were comatose. 14 patients were
          unresponsive from previous treatment attempts and their cancer
          complications. </p>
        <p>The diet during treatment consisted mainly of whole grains,
          vegetables, linoleic acid rich oils (linseed, walnut, soy,
          wheat germ) and other supplemental food. According to
          individual cases Cesium chloride was given at daily dosages of
          6 to 9 g (this is now considered unnecessarily high). in three
          equally divided doses. Also given to all the patients: </p>
        <p>Vitamin A-emulsion (100,000 to 300,000 U) <br>
          Vitamin C (4 to 30g) <br>
          Zinc (80 to 100 mg) <br>
          Chelating agent EDTA <br>
          Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) </p>
        <p>Selenium (600 to 1,200 mcg) <br>
          Laetrile (1500 mg) <br>
          Vitamin K <br>
          Mg salts <br>
          Other supplements according to specific patient needs . </p>
        <p>As you can see, all these additonal treatments and
          supplements could have had just as much effect as the Cesium
          chloride making this study less than conclusive. Vitamin A and
          C are significant cancer treatments. However, it should be
          pointed out that 1500 mg of Laetrile is very little, the
          recommend theraputic does is 6,000 mg (intravenous). </p>
        <p>Each patient showed a reduction in the tumor mass even after
          only forty-eight hours. Of the 17 comatose and moribund
          patients, 12 died from complications of their cancers but
          especially the consequences of chemotherapy and radiation. One
          comatose breast cancer patient recovered so rapidly that after
          five days she attempted to leave her bed. When stepping out of
          her bed, she feel and broke a cervical vertebra which led to
          her demise within another eight days (a metastasis had
          destroyed her femur and caused her fall). </p>
        <p>Of a series of the first 50 patients with a variety of
          terminal cancers, as of July 1, 1984 the survival time of the
          25 survivors, all of them expected to die not later than 2
          weeks to 3 months after the treatment was started, is it at
          least 8 months and up to 3 years and 3 months. One of the most
          striking effects of the treatment was the disappearance of
          pain in all patients within one to three days after initiating
          Cs-therapy. The results demonstrate the rate of effectiveness
          of CsCl in cancer therapy. </p>
        <p><b>Studies</b> </p>
        <p>Besides the 50 patient study at Life Science Universal
          Medical Center described in the Effectiveness" section above,
          the following is a summary of "The high pH therapy for cancer
          tests on mice and humans." PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV 21: Suppl.
          1, 1-5. 1984, by A. K. Brewer, was found: </p>
        <p>Mass spectrographic and isotope studies have shown that
          potassium, rubidium, and especially cesium are most
          efficiently taken up by cancer cells. This uptake was enhanced
          by Vitamins A and C as well as salts of zinc and selenium. The
          quantity of cesium taken up was sufficient to raise the cell
          to the 8 pH range. Where cell mitosis ceases and the life of
          the cell is short. Tests on mice fed cesium and rubidium
          showed marked shrinkage in the tumor masses within 2 weeks. In
          addition, the mice showed none of the side effects of cancer.
        </p>
        <p><b>Conclusiveness of Papers</b> </p>
        <p>The non-peer reviewed articles make a strong case for the
          effectiveness of cesium chloride. However, when studies are
          not critically reviewed, they can be critically flawed. <br>
          Standalone Ability </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride gets a low rating for standalone ability
          because it must be taken with potassium. Also, studies that
          used cesium chloride combined it with other supplements, see
          the "Effectiveness" section. Potassium depletion is not a
          serious problem because it is easy to replace potassium.
          Actually, most cesium chloride supplements contain large
          amounts of potassium. </p>
        <p><b>Ease of Use and Dosage</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride supplements are available in pill form in a
          wide range of doses. </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride and a high pH diet causes potassium
          depletion. Therefore, it becomes necessary to supplemented
          with potassium. Most potassium supplements supply 100 mg of
          potassium. One banana supplies 500 mg of potassium... </p>
        <p>The minimal dosage for curative action has not been
          determined. It has been observed by several physicians that
          the administration of .5 g per day of CsCL will actually
          enhance the rate of tumor growth. This is to be expected,
          since this low amount is sufficient only to raise the cell pH
          into the high mitosis range. The data so far reveal that any
          quantity of 3.0 g or above will be effective. </p>
        <p>People who change their eating habits greatly increase the
          effectiveness of the supplements they take. </p>
        <p><b>Side Effects</b> </p>
        <p>In a small number of people, Cesium Chloride has been linked
          with ventricular tachycardia, a rapid and irregular heartbeat
          that can lead to sudden cardiac death. </p>
        <p>A side effect which occurs in some cases, especially those
          who have had stomach ulcers, is nausea. This side effect
          occurs far less often with the 3.0 g per day dose than for 6.0
          g dose which is recommended by some of the more aggressive
          therapists. </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride and a high pH diet causes potassium
          depletion. Therefore, it becomes necessary to supplemented
          with potassium. Most potassium supplements supply 100 mg of
          potassium. One banana supplies 500 mg of potassium.
          Essense-of-life offers a liquid containing cesium chloride
          with potassium in a ballanced formular. Cesium chloride stays
          in the body for a couple of months after discinuation of use.
          For that reason a person should contiune postassium
          supplementation for a couple of months after discintuation of
          cesium chloride. Essense-of-life (see the "Manufacturers"
          section) includes comprenseive instructions along these lines
          with each order of cesium chloride. </p>
        <p><b>From the ACS</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride is not considered toxic. However, the acute
          and chronic toxicity of this substance is not fully known.
          Consuming large amounts of cesium could result in nausea and
          diarrhea. Based on results of animal studies, women who are
          pregnant or breast-feeding should avoid taking cesium chloride
          supplements. </p>
        <p><b>Compatibility</b> </p>
        <p>There is no known conflict between cesium chloride and other
          medications or supplements. However, there are no known
          studies to determine compatibility. </p>
        <p><b>Cost per Month</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride costs $70 for a one month supply if taking 3
          grams per day. </p>
        <p><b>Testimonials and Belief</b> </p>
        <p>Testimonials can be a very powerful tool to help in the
          healing process because they can boost your belief in a
          treatment. However, reading testimonies is a poor method of
          making a treatment selection. An alternative cancer treatment
          with only a 5% success rate can still obtain many genuine and
          impressive testimonials. A selected group of positive
          testimonials cannot compare to a published study were all of
          the qualified case histories are presented, the failures as
          well as the successes. </p>
        <p>For the above reason, it is not a good idea to use
          testimonials to help you select a cancer treatment. Save
          testimonials for the role that they perform the best,
          bolstering belief after treatments have been selected. Using
          an Alternative Cancer Treatment Test kit is a much better
          method of making the treatment decision. </p>

        <p><b>USE OF CESIUM CHLORIDE TO CURE MALIGNANCIES</b> </p>
        <p><b>By Dr. James Howenstine, MD.</b> <br>
          <b>June 29, 2004</b> <br>
          <b>NewsWithViews.com</b></p>
        <p>Nobel Prize Laureate, Dr. Otto Warburg, discovered that when
          he lowered the oxygen levels of tissues by 35 % for 48 hours
          normal cells were converted into irreversible cancer cells.
          Cancer patients have low levels of oxygen in their blood
          usually around 60 compared to normal values of about 100 by
          pulse oximetry. The common therapies used to treat cancer
          (chemotherapy and radiation) both cause drastic falls in the
          body's oxygen levels. Tissues that are acidotic contain low
          levels of oxygen whereas tissues that are alkalotic have high
          levels of oxygen. </p>
        <p>In a normal cell glucose and oxygen easily enter the cell and
          waste products are promptly eliminated from the cell. The cell
          ph remains in the normal range of 7.35. When the outer lining
          membranes of the cell are chronically irritated by toxic
          substances (exposure to carcinogens) this membrane functions
          abnormally by failing to permit oxygen to enter the cell while
          glucose is still able to enter the cell. </p>
        <p>Potassium ions are responsible for the ability of glucose to
          enter the cell. Potassium enters cancer cells in a normal
          manner so glucose still enters the cancer cell. Cancer cells
          have only 1%[1] of the calcium content found in normal healthy
          cells. The calcium, magnesium and sodium ions, which are
          responsible for the intake of oxygen into the cell, can not
          enter the cancer cell but the potassium ion still enters these
          cells. Thus we have cancer cells containing glucose but no
          oxygen. </p>
        <p>When oxygen fails to enter the cell the cell's ability to
          control it's ph is lost and the cell becomes quite acidic.
          This is caused by the appearance of abnormal metabolism
          (anerobic glycolysis) in which glucose is converted
          (fermentation) into two particles of lactic acid. This
          production of lactic acid promptly lowers the ph within the
          cell to 6.5 or lower. The lactic acid damages the template for
          proper DNA formation. Messenger RNA is also changed so the
          ability of the cell to control its growth is lacking. Rapid
          and uncontrolled cancer cell growth and division occurs.
          Vitamin C and zinc are able to enhance the uptake of cesium,
          rubidium, and potassium into cancer cells. </p>
        <p><b>Why The Current Cancer Surveillance And Therapy Programs
            Have Failed</b> </p>
        <p>During our lives we all kill millions of cancer cells unless
          our immune systems become injured. When a clinician is able to
          diagnose a cancer of the lung by chest xray, breast cancer by
          mammogram, or colon cancer by colonoscopy etc. it has already
          been in the body for 6 to 8 years and has had ample time to
          spread to other parts of the body. This is the reason that the
          massive program to get annual mammograms in women is a
          complete failure. The survival rate from breast cancer is the
          same for women who have never had a mammogram as for those who
          obtain annual mammograms (large population studies from Canada
          and Denmark discovered this). </p>
        <p>Cancer treatment programs are based on the false concept that
          chemotherapy will kill more tumor cells than healthy cells and
          thus lead to recovery. The very cells (bone marrow) that
          enable a human to recover from cancer are damaged by
          chemotherapy. How could a therapy known to cause cancer
          (radiation) be able to improve long term survival for very
          many cancer victims? The statistics show that no more people
          are surviving now than 25 years ago. Both chemotherapy and
          radiation injure the immune system which is vital for
          surviving cancer. </p>
        <p>The cancer cartel has no interest in curing cancer because
          chemotherapy drugs are an enormously profitable product for
          the pharmaceutical industry. An important clue proving that
          there is no sincere interest in curing cancer is provided by
          the fact that only .5% (one half of one percent) of the
          dollars spent on cancer research is spent on research directed
          at stopping the spread[2] of cancer (metastases). When a
          cancer fails to spread the patient can live many comfortable
          years in an uneventful manner. </p>
        <p><b>Factors Influencing The Development Of Malignant Diseases</b>
        </p>
        <p>All persons are normally killing millions of cancer cells
          unless their immune system becomes injured. There are at least
          6 things that can injure the immune system: </p>
        <p><i>Nutritional Deficiencies</i> (examples) --- Inadequate
          reserves of vitamin C and E can increase the morbidity
          experienced in surgical ICUs after massive trauma. Lack of
          selenium increases the risk of developing malignancies,
          infections and heart disease. </p>
        <p><i>Infection ---</i> Serious infections can deplete
          phagocytes, cause coagulation problems, nutritional
          deficiencies, impaired circulation etc. </p>
        <p><i>Exposure to Radiation</i> --- Injury to DNA and bone
          marrow may follow radiation leading to malignant changes in
          cells and greater opportunity for infections to occur. </p>
        <p><i>Toxins</i> --- Exposure to unhealthy dietary transfats,
          heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, chemicals, fluoride etc.
          injures the immune system's ability to mobilize a prompt
          effective response. The lack of dietary essential omega 3
          fatty acids is an important cause for immune injury for 90% of
          U.S. citizens. </p>
        <p><i>Stress</i> --- When prolonged stress occurs the body
          steadily releases cortisone that causes suppression of the
          immune system, death of nerve cells, failure to kill abnormal
          cells, and risk of infection may increase... </p>
        <p><i>Aging</i> --- There is diminished ability to activate the
          immune system as we age. This contributes to the occurrence of
          malignancies and infections in the elderly. </p>
        <p><b>Have There Been Any Cures For Cancer?</b> </p>
        <p>All health care practitioners who have developed a cure for
          cancer from Dr. Coley's toxins in 1900 through Dr. Stanislaw
          Burzinsky's antineoplaston currently have been greeted with
          vicious opposition, lies in the media if the media even admits
          the product exists, inability to get information published in
          mainline journals where physicians could read it, and
          frequently there is continuing harassment from lawsuits
          threatening loss of medical licensure. There have been at
          least a dozen safe cures for cancer down through the past
          century of health care that have come and gone without the
          general public's awareness that they even existed. The cancer
          industry is so powerful that television, newspapers, and
          medical journals subsidized by revenue from pharmaceutical
          advertisements are generally unwilling to admit that these
          cures have ever existed. Often fabricated articles are
          published disparaging the safety and effectiveness of the cure
          thus frightening the general public away from some natural
          therapy that could make them well. It is quite difficult for
          lay people to realize who is giving them the truth.. </p>
        <p><b>Using Alkali Therapy To Cure Cancer</b> </p>
        <p>Parts of the world that have high levels of strong alkaline
          minerals in their water have a very low incidence of cancer.
          The Hopi Indians have water that contains rubidium and
          potassium while the Hunzas of Northern Pakistan have water
          high in cesium and potassium. The Hopis and Hunzas do not
          develop cancer unless they move away from their homeland. Of
          considerable interest both the Hopis and Hunzas eat apricot
          kernels on a regular basis (laetrile). </p>
        <p>Effective therapies that cure cancer have come and gone
          frequently since 1900. Alkali therapy for cancer was developed
          in that era. It worked quite well for cancer but was forgotten
          when only a few practitioners heard about it and were willing
          to face the opposition that the medical establishment directs
          toward anyone not using conventional methods of therapy. The
          use of strong alkali provided a permanent cure[3] for many
          patients. </p>
        <p>The most alkaline minerals (cesium, rubidium, potassium) are
          able to enter cancer cells. Their strong alkalinity,
          particularly that of cesium, causes the ph within the cell to
          rise to values of 8 or higher because they affect ph more than
          the weak acid (lactic acid) within the cancer cell. In the
          very alkaline state cancer cells can survive for only a few
          days or less depending on the degree of alkalinity present in
          the cancer cell. If many cancer cells die simultaneously the
          body's ability to process and eliminate the breakdown products
          of massive cellular death may be overwhelmed causing a
          "detoxification reaction". The primary organ involved in
          detoxification by the body is the liver. Symptoms might
          include flu like symptoms, headache, nausea, and skin rash.
          The liver can increase it's ability to eliminate toxins by the
          use of the herb milk thistle which is a good idea during
          cancer therapy. </p>
        <p>Sometimes there is so much malignant tissue dying sinus
          tracts will appear on the skin. This enables the body to get
          more of the toxic substances released from dead cells out of
          the body faster. Healthy normal cells have normal electrical
          potential in their cell membranes which allows them to keep
          cesium out of the cells. </p>
        <p>Cesium capsules can rarely be a cause for perforation of the
          stomach or small intestine if they become positioned against
          the wall of either organ. For this reason cesium must always
          be taken with food and the liquid form of cesium would appear
          to be safer than a capsule. </p>
        <p>One of the conditions observed after cesium therapy was a
          striking rise in blood uric acid levels. This is caused by
          massive release of DNA from dead cancer cells. DNA is
          metabolized into uric acid. Typically the values went from 3.5
          mg. to 20 mg. This has the potential to cause decreased kidney
          function because large amounts of uric acid appearing in
          kidney tubules can form crystals that block the tubules. If a
          large number of kidney tubules become blocked kidney function
          fails and uremia appears. This is easy to prevent by using the
          pharmaceutical drug Xyloprim (allopurinol) before and
          concomitantly with cesium so that excessively high values of
          uric acid do not develop. This might only be needed when 20 or
          more grams of cesium (high dosage) are being taken daily.
          Xyloprim lowers the blood level of uric acid by shifting the
          metabolism of proteins so that the body produces less uric
          acid, thus decreasing the blood levels of uric acid and the
          amount of uric acid the kidney needs to excrete. </p>
        <p>Cancer cells contain a fibrin meshwork 13 to 15 times thicker
          than the fibrin meshwork surrounding normal cells. This fibrin
          mesh surrounding cancer cells is believed to play a key role
          in the ability of cancer cells to escape destruction by making
          it quite difficult for the killer lymphocytes, phagocyes and
          cytokines of the immune system to contact and destroy cancer
          cells. As we age our ability to manufacture enzymes steadily
          diminishes. The key enzyme component in an effective enzyme
          preparation is chymotrypsin or serrapeptase both of which
          increase the body's ability to produce more enzymes. We like
          Vitalzyme for malignancies because of the widespread reports
          of good results using the the enzyme serrapeptase which is
          found in Vitalzyme. The dose can begin with 3 tablets three
          times daily on an empty stomach. This dose should be steadily
          raised at regular intervals if no improvement is seen.
          Enzymatic digestion of this fibrin mesh is an important part
          of cancer therapy. The processing of dead cancer cells is also
          expedited by the digestion of tissue fragments caused by
          enzyme therapy. </p>
        <p><b>Clinical Results With Cesium Therapy</b> </p>
        <p>Dr. H. E. Sartori began his cesium cancer therapy program in
          April 1981 at Life Sciences Universal Medical Clinics in
          Rockville, Md. Fifty patients with widespread metastatic tumor
          deposits were treated. Forty-seven of these 50 patients had
          already completed maximal modalities of treatment, i.e.
          surgery, radiation, multiple courses of chemotherapy before
          cesium was tried. Their condition was hopeless. </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride was given in 3 equal divided doses of 6 to 9
          grams daily. Supplemental vitamin A emulsion (100,000 to
          300,000 U), vitamin C (4 to 30 grams), zinc (80 to 100 mg.,
          selenium (600 to 1200 mg.), and amygadalin (1500 mg.) were
          given plus other supplements. The diet consisted primarily of
          whole grains, vegetables, linolenic acid rich foods (flaxseed,
          walnut, soy, wheat germ) and other supplemented food. EDTA
          (chelation, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and a combination of
          vitamins K, and magnesium salts were also given. The types of
          malignancies treated included 10 patients with breast cancer,
          9 with colon cancer, 6 with prostate cancer, 4 had pancreatic
          cancer, 5 had lung cancer, 3 had liver cancer (hepatoma), 3
          had lymphoma, 1 had Ewing's sarcoma of the pelvis, 1 had an
          adenocarcinoma and 8 had cancer from an unknown site of
          origin. </p>
        <p>Approximately 50 % of patients with breast, colon, prostate,
          pancreas and lung cancer survived. Three patients were
          comatose when the therapy was initiated. Thirteen patients
          died in the first 2 weeks of therapy. Autopsy results in each
          of these 13 disclosed reduction in tumor mass size caused by
          cesium therapy. Also pain disappeared in all patients within 1
          to 3 days after initiation of cesium therapy. This may have
          reflected decreased production of lactic acid by dying cancer
          cells. </p>
        <p>One breast cancer patient was of considerable interest. She
          was comatose when cesium therapy was initiated using a feeding
          tube. She received 10 grams of cesium chloride three times
          daily. She walked out of the hospital 5 days later.
          Unfortunately it was not appreciated that a hip had been
          completely replaced by tumor tissue which disappeared with
          therapy. Having no bony tissue to support her weight she fell
          at home fracturing her neck resulting in death. The autopsy
          revealed no hip bone and only very small amounts of cancer
          tissue. This is a spectacular therapeutic result despite the
          tragic death. </p>
        <p>In a group of 8 patients where the site of origin of the
          malignancy was unknown 2 patients died in the first 14 days
          and 2 more died in the first year. Four of the patients were
          still alive when last heard from more than a year later.
          Conventional cancer therapy has never produced any results
          like these as similar cases without a clear site of origin for
          cancer usually die rapidly. </p>
        <p>A patient with lymphoma had a huge hard abdomen. He weighed
          250 pounds. 120 pounds of weight was lost in the first 3
          months of cesium therapy. His spleen was initially in his
          pelvis. This shrank to nearly normal size. The liver was
          enlarged to the umbilicus before therapy. This returned to
          normal size in 3 months. He was alive 3 years later at which
          time he was again taking chemotherapy. </p>
        <p>Dr. Sartori believes that doses of cesium should not exceed
          20 to 40 grams daily because of side effects of nausea and
          diarrhea. He felt that these results confirmed earlier results
          by Messiha which had suggested that large doses of cesium
          seemed to be more effective than low doses. </p>
        <p>Dr. Sartori took 40 grams of cesium himself which caused only
          nausea and unusual sensations around the mouth believed to be
          related to potassium depletion. The usual dosage used in his
          clinic was 2 or 3 grams three times daily. When there is no
          remaining sign of cancer he thinks the dose can be safely
          reduced to .5 or 1 gram daily. Some patients on cesium develop
          evidence of potassium depletion so serum potassium needs to be
          monitored along with uric acid blood levels. Any alkali
          therapy changes the ph of the body toward a more alkalotic
          state. This causes movement of potassium into cells which may
          result in low serum potassium values. This movement of
          potassium into cells means that a person can become seriously
          depleted of potassium even if there is no diarrhea or
          vomiting. </p>
        <p>A case of primary liver cancer (hepatoma) was treated later.
          She was a 39 year old school teacher who was terminal on
          arrival on April 25, 1984. Her liver was enlarged 1 inch below
          the umbilicus. She walked out of the hospital on May 10, 1984.
          Her liver had shrunk to 2 inches above the umbilicus. The
          alpha fetoprotein tumor marker for hepatoma had decreased from
          39,000 units to 5000 units. </p>
        <p>On one occasion Dr. Sartori noticed the disappearance of
          metastatic tumor masses within one hour of cesium therapy. Two
          days later wrinkles appeared in the skin where the tumor
          masses had been located. </p>
        <p>Physicist A. Keith Brewer became very interested in cancer in
          the 1930s. He performed fundamental research on the membranes
          surrounding normal cells, rapidly growing cells (embryonal and
          cancerous) and dead tissue. The methods used by him included
          spectrographic, fluorescence decay patterns, and
          phosphorescence decay patterns of radioisotopes of potassium
          in nature. He felt that he was one of only a few persons who
          had actually studied ion transport across membranes. </p>
        <p>His research enabled him to devise a protocol to treat cancer
          patients using cesium. Dr. Brewer then treated 30 patients
          with various cancers using cesium with all subjects surviving.
          The patients he treated were obviously not as sick as those in
          Dr. Sartori's group but his results provide further very
          encouraging evidence about cesium's value. </p>
        <p>Rescuing 25 cancer victims from certain death is a remarkable
          accomplishment for cesium therapy. Conventional therapy for
          malignancies using chemotherapy and radiation has never been
          able to cure patients whose initial tumor has spread to
          another site i.e. liver, lung , brain, etc. The nearly
          deceased patients treated by Dr. Sartori had tumor deposits
          scattered all over their bodies. A sizeable number (50 %) of
          these patients recovered. Additionally, it is unheard of for a
          patient whose site of origin of a tumor remains unknown to
          recover. In Dr. Sartori's series 4 out of 8 such patients were
          alive one year later. </p>
        <p>I am sorry that the results of Sartori and Brewer's studies
          using cesium have not received the wide publication they
          deserve but this is not surprising. If you know a person with
          "hopeless" or any other cancer cesium seems like a promising
          direction to pursue. </p>
        <p>In my opinion an ideal therapy for malignancies needs to meet
          several criteria: </p>
        <p><i>Safety</i> --- There have been only a few serious
          complications of cesium noted (perforations, severe nausea)
          which may be avoided with liquid cesium. </p>
        <p><i>Simplicity</i> --- The therapy needs to be simple enough
          that an ordinary practitioner can manage it. The patients not
          requiring hospital care should be able to be cared for in an
          office practice where any needed lab studies can be obtained.
        </p>
        <p><i>Reasonable Expense</i> --- While not cheap at $80 to $200
          for a months supply of cesium this is a pittance compared to
          the cost of chemotherapy and the certainty of unpleasant side
          effects from chemotherapy agents. </p>
        <p><i>Easy Dissemination Of Information About Therapy</i> ---
          The public needs to become aware that the pharmaceutical
          industry and their friends in the FDA and other regulatory
          agencies will do everything they can to block the spread of
          information that could decrease the sale of chemotherapy
          drugs. Cancer has been cured at least twelve times since 1900
          but the public never hears about it. Lay people armed with a
          little understanding of how cesium works and where it can be
          purchased can save a lot of lives. </p>
        <p>There are not many medical practitioners trained in some of
          the effective sophisticated natural therapies used to treat
          malignancies. With cancer now ready to supplant heart attacks
          as the leading cause for death in the U.S. medical
          practitioners will need to become teachers and enlist lay
          people to spread good news if the cancer epidemic is to be
          defeated. Expect no assistance from government bureaucrats
          because their allegiance is clearly to the pharmaceutical
          firms who take good care of them. Of course, this does not
          mean that there are not many government employees sincerely
          interested in public health measures. Unfortunately these
          dedicated persons are not the ones making the decisions... </p>
        <p><b>Who Should Be Considered For Cesium Therapy?</b> </p>
        <p>This is an ideal therapy for anyone with terminal malignancy.
          If you know someone who has been told get your affairs in
          order you only have 3 to 6 months to live that person has a
          reasonable chance of recovery with cesium therapy. They may
          need 3 to 6 grams of cesium three times daily to recover. The
          person who is emaciated and unable to eat anything or is in a
          terminal coma she get 9 grams of cesium three times daily. </p>
        <p>Other cancer patients who have not lost their appetites and
          are eating normally might be tried on one gram of cesium three
          times daily with observation for signs of recovery (receding
          tumor masses). The dose should be raised if there is no
          obvious improvement in 4 to 6 weeks. </p>
        <p>The ability of cesium to heal metastatic cancer and cancers
          that have started and spread without their site of origin
          being known makes cesium quite important in treating
          malignancies. Cesium works in lymphomas so there is a
          possibility it could cure leukemia and polycythemia vera as
          well because the cells of origin in both are derived from bone
          marrow ( lymphocytes, white blood cells, red blood cells). </p>

        <p>Cesium, a mineral resource abundantly present in Manitoba
          with important existing and potential industrial applications
          was investigated to study its effects on biological systems.
          Several rodent models of pharmacological activities were
          utilized. The profile that emerged indicated that cesium is
          only moderately toxic and exerts salubrious effects which
          could be gainfully investigated for application in the
          treatment of certain psychological disorders and some tumors.
          Its conjunction with existing pharmacological agents for these
          two types of disorders could yield a pharmacologically active
          yet less toxic therapeutic combination. </p>

        <p>A brief overview on the relevance in dietary factors in both
          development and prevention of cancer is presented. The
          pharmacologic properties of various food ingredients are
          discussed. Establishing of a special diet for the cancer
          patient is suggested. In addition, avoidance of certain foods
          is recommended to counteract mucus production of cancer cells.
          Evaluation of the nutrient content of certain diets in regions
          with low incidence of cancer has advanced the use of certain
          alkali metals, i.e., rubidium and cesium, as chemotherapeutic
          agents. The rationale for this approach termed the "high pH"
          therapy resides in changing the acidic pH range of the cancer
          cell by cesium towards weak alkalinity in which the survival
          of the cancer cell is endangered, and the formation of acidic
          and toxic materials, normally formed in cancer cells, is
          neutralized and eliminated. </p>

        <p>The effect of CsCl on the life span of female Sprague-Dawley
          rats innoculated with Novikoff's hepatoma was studied as a
          function of both pre- and post-treatment with CsCl and as a
          function of the inoculant dose. The effect of KCl on the CsCl
          treatment was also studied. Rats treated with CsCl for 12
          consecutive days prior to or immediately after inoculation
          with 1.0 ml of viable hepatoma cell suspension showed an
          increase in mortality score from corresponding controls.
          Conversely, increases in the dose of the inoculant resulted in
          delaying the onset of toxicity in rats receiving the
          Cs-treatment after inoculation as evidenced by a decrease in
          mortality. Availability of KCl in drinking water ad lib
          further decreased total mortality when given alone but not
          when combined with CsCl. The results indicate a dose-dependent
          paradoxical effect of CsCl on Novikoff hepatoma cell toxicity
          and suggest a critical intercellular balance requirement
          between Cs+ and K+ on the effect studied. </p>

        <p>The effect of pretreatment with CsCl on mice bearing sarcoma
          I implants was studied as a function of duration of treatment
          period, life span and tissue Cs+ and K+ levels. Treatment with
          CsCl for 14 consecutive days prior to sarcoma implantation
          resulted in initial reduction of the tumor-mediated mortality
          compared to controls and to a one week pretreatment period
          with identical doses of CsCl. A large accumulation of
          endogenous K+ was noted in tumor mass compared to nonmalignant
          tissue of the same animals or to tumor-free controls receiving
          identical Cs-treatment. The entry of exogenously administered
          Cs+ into malignant tissue was less than that accumulating in
          respective controls. The accumulation of Cs+ in tumor mass was
          dose-dependent. The ratio of K+:C+ was greater in tumor tissue
          than in nonmalignant tissue. The results suggest that a
          critical balance between these alkali metals may be required
          for adequate Cs effect against the tumor studied. </p>

        <p>The effect of cesium therapy on various cancers is reported.
          A total of 50 patients were treated over a 3 year period with
          CsCl. The majority of the patients have been unresponsive to
          previous maximal modalities of cancer treatment and were
          considered terminal cases. The Cs-treatment consisted of CsCl
          in addition to some vitamins, minerals, chelating agents and
          salts of selenium, potassium and magnesium. In addition, a
          special diet was also instituted. There was an impressive 50%
          recovery of various cancers, i.e., cancer of unknown primary,
          breast, colon, prostate, pancrease, lung, liver, lymphoma,
          ewing sarcoma of the pelvis and adeno-cancer of the
          gallbladder, by the Cs-therapy employed. There was a 26% and
          24% death within the initial 2 weeks and 12 months of
          treatment, respectively. A consistent finding in these
          patients was the disappearance of pain within the initial 3
          days of Cs-treatment. The small number of autopsies made
          showed the absence of cancer cells in most cases and the
          clinical impression indicates a remarkably successful outcome
          of treatment. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;Mass spectrographic and isotope studies have shown that
          potassium, rubidium, and especially cesium are most
          efficiently taken up by cancer cells. This uptake was enhanced
          by Vitamins A and C as well as salts of zinc and selenium. The
          quantity of cesium taken up was sufficient to raise the cell
          to the 8 pH range. Where cell mitosis ceases and the life of
          the cell is short. Tests on mice fed cesium and rubidium
          showed marked shrinkage in the tumor masses within 2 weeks. In
          addition, the mice showed none of the side effects of cancer.
          Tests have been carried out on over 30 humans. In each case
          the tumor masses disappeared. Also all pains and effects
          associated with cancer disappeared within 12 to 36 hr; the
          more chemotherapy and morphine the patient had taken, the
          longer the withdrawal period. Studies of the food intake in
          areas where the incidences of cancer are very low showed that
          it met the requirements for the high pH therapy. </p>

        <p>The effect of separate and combined administration of 15%
          ethanol and 0.2% CsCl solution on life span of rats with
          Novikoff hepatoma implants was studied as a function of time
          of initiation of treatment. Pretreatment with CsCl alone or
          combined with ethanol resulted in earlier onset on morbidity
          compared to the ethanol-treatment or to controls. As high as
          87.5% of Cs-treated animals died 16 days post tumor
          implantation compared to 33% of rats receiving CsCl and
          ethanol combined. This protective action of ethanol against
          Cs-evoked toxicity in tumor-bearing rats persisted through the
          experiment. Animals subjected to drug treatment immediately
          after tumor transplantation displayed delayed onset of
          morbidity compared to drug pretreated rats. In both cases the
          Cs-treatment enhanced morbidity by approximately 2 folds from
          corresponding controls. Animals sacrificed 18 days post tumor
          inoculation showed an induction of hepatic alcohol
          dehydrogenase and an increase in Vmax without changes in the
          apparent Km by the Cs-treatment. There was an increase in
          liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase of hepatoma-bearing
          rats from tumor-free controls which was associated with an
          increase in the apparent Km value. The results indicate
          potentiation of the hepatoma toxicity by CsCl which may be
          minimized by ethanol. A role for hepatic enzymes determined in
          the pathogenesis of tumor line studied and/or their use as a
          biochemical correlate is suggested. </p>

        <p>A high pH therapy for cancer arrived at theoretically was
          tested in mice by feeding them rubidium carbonate. Tumours
          were transplanted in the abdomen of mice and allowed to grow
          for 8 days. The mice were then divided into two groups. The
          control group was continued on conventional mouse chow. The
          test group, in addition to the mouse chow, was force-fed 1.11
          mg of rubidium carbonate dissolved in distilled water. At the
          end of 13 more days the tumours in the controls had grown to a
          large size so all the mice were sacrificed. The tumours were
          then removed and weighed. The tumours in the test animals
          weighed essentially one eleventh of those in the controls. In
          addition the test animals were showing no adverse effects from
          the cancers. The probability that this marked difference in
          tumour size could have come about by chance is exceedingly
          small. </p>

        <p>The chloride salts of lithium (Li+) and cesium (Cs+) were
          evaluated for their ability to influence the growth of Sarcoma
          I implants in A/J mice. The administration of daily doses of
          either 1 or 3 mEq/kg CsCl to these mice reduced the incidence
          and size of tumor implants. This effect was not apparent in
          animals receiving a smaller dose (0.5 mEq/kg) of the same
          drug. At the time of sacrifice the serum level of Cs+ in this
          latter group was approximately half that recorded in animals
          receiving the higher doses of CsCl. No effect on tumor
          incidence or rate of growth was observed in animals receiving
          different doses of LiCl. Because of the similarities that
          existed between cesium and potassium, it was postulated that
          the effect of cesium was due to alterations in the
          intracellular composition of the tumor cells. Also, the
          possible role of cytotoxic agents in potentiating the
          inhibitory effect of cesium on tumors was discussed. </p>

        <p>Other common name(s): high pH therapy </p>
        <p>Scientific/medical name(s): CsCl </p>
        <p><b>Description</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium is a rare, naturally occurring element of alkali metal
          similar in chemical structure to lithium, sodium, and
          potassium. Cesium chloride is a salt form of this element. </p>
        <p><b>Overview</b> </p>
        <p>Radioactive cesium (cesium-137) is used in certain types of
          radiation therapy for cancer patients. However, available
          scientific evidence does not support claims that
          non-radioactive cesium chloride supplements have any effect on
          tumors. A few people have had life-threatening problems with
          heart rhythm, seizures, loss of consciousness, and electrolyte
          (blood chemistry) imbalances after taking cesium. </p>
        <p><b>How is it promoted for use?</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium can be absorbed by all cells, probably due to its
          similarity in chemical structure to potassium. Proponents
          claim the intracellular pH of tumor cells is usually very low
          (acidic) compared to normal cells, and that cesium chloride
          supplements increase the pH level of tumor cells back to a
          normal level, which is supposed to slow the cancer's growth.
          Since cesium chloride is claimed to work by raising the pH of
          the tumor cells, its use in therapy has been called "high pH
          therapy." Available scientific evidence does not support this
          theory. </p>
        <p><b>What does it involve?</b> </p>
        <p>Cesium chloride supplements are available in pill form.
          Proponents suggest a dosage of 1 to 6 grams per day, sometimes
          dissolved in juice together with vitamins and other minerals.
          Some practitioners give cesium chloride intravenously (IV). </p>
        <p><b>What is the history behind it?</b> </p>
        <p>Interest in cesium therapy began when scientists observed
          that certain regions of the world with low rates of certain
          cancers had a high concentration of alkali metals in the soil.
          As early as the 1920s, some researchers suggested cesium might
          be effective as an anti-tumor agent. However, further
          research, starting in the 1930s suggested cesium had no effect
          on cancer cell growth. The use of cesium chloride for high pH
          therapy was first advanced in the 1980s. </p>
        <p><b>What is the evidence?</b> </p>
        <p>There is no evidence that the intracellular pH of a cancer
          cell is any different than a normal cell or that malignant
          cells are more susceptible than normal cells to toxic effects
          of high pH. Thus, the underlying principle behind high pH
          therapy remains unproven. Although it was observed that
          certain areas with low rates of cancers had a high
          concentration of alkali metals in the soil, it has never been
          shown that differences in other risk factors or protective
          factors were not involved, or that cesium provides any benefit
          in the prevention or treatment of cancer. </p>
        <p>Studies conducted in several experimental tumor models in the
          1980s found that the use of cesium or cesium chloride led to
          less tumor growth and fewer deaths of certain tumor-bearing
          mice such as those with sarcoma or breast cancer. In animal
          studies, chronic ingestion of cesium caused blood and
          neuromuscular effects, and even death. Animal and laboratory
          studies may show a substance has toxic effects, but further
          studies are necessary to determine if the results apply to
          humans. More research is needed to determine the risks and
          safety of cesium. The benefit of cesium for people with
          cancer, if any, is unknown. </p>

        <p>This product is sold as a dietary supplement in the United
          States. Unlike drugs (which must be tested before being
          allowed to be sold), the companies that make supplements are
          not required to prove to the Food and Drug Administration that
          their supplements are safe or effective, as long as they don't
          claim the supplements can prevent, treat, or cure any specific
          disease. </p>
        <p>Some such products may not contain the amount of the herb or
          substance that is written on the label, and some may include
          other substances (contaminants). Actual amounts per dose may
          vary between brands or even between different batches of the
          same brand. </p>
        <p>Most such supplements have not been tested to find out if
          they interact with medicines, foods, or other herbs and
          supplements. Even though some reports of interactions and
          harmful effects may be published, full studies of interactions
          and effects are not often available. Because of these
          limitations, any information on ill effects and interactions
          below should be considered incomplete. </p>
        <p>In a case report from 1984, one person described his own
          experiences after taking cesium chloride for 36 days. He took
          3 grams of cesium chloride dissolved in fluid after his
          morning and evening meals, which consisted of an alternative
          dietary regimen. He describes an “initial general feeling of
          well-being and heightened sense perception,” as well as
          nausea, diarrhea, and tingling of his lips, hands, and feet.
          This case report is very different from a clinical trial
          involving many patients and is not helpful in deciding on a
          safe dose of cesium. Another person, who may be younger,
          older, smaller, or less healthy than this individual may not
          do well with this dose. </p>
        <p>In fact, several recent case reports have described serious
          side effect in people with cancer taking similar doses,
          including life-threatening problems with heart rhythm,
          seizures, loss of consciousness, and electrolyte (blood
          chemistry) imbalances in patients who were taking cesium. Full
          information on the acute and chronic toxicity of this
          substance is not fully known. Consuming large amounts of
          cesium could result in nausea, diarrhea, disturbed heart
          rhythm, loss of consciousness, or even death. Based on results
          of animal studies, women who are pregnant or breast-feeding
          should avoid taking cesium chloride supplements. Relying on
          this type of treatment alone, and avoiding conventional
          medical care, may also have serious health consequences. </p>
