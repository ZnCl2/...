        of radiation (electrons, photons, positrons, gamma, beta and
        alpha radiations, etc.) in a controlled power generating system;

      </p>
      <p><b>Description ~</b> </p>
      <p>This invention is directed to a source of energy such as an
        engine wherein the energy is derived from rearrangements within
        an atom or atoms. Since such rearrangements are reversible, the
        utilization of suitably charged elements or atoms which are
        capable of rearrangement permits the conversion of potential
        energy into kinetic energy over very long prolonged periods of
        time with a single charge of atoms or elements of suitable
        composition. The invention is postulated upon the premise that
        when a substance is exposed to conditions under which the
        absorption of energy is possible (as by the use of suitable
        electric charge or discharge), the electrons which are in their
        lowest energy or ground state take up the energy and pass into
        the states of higher energy or excited state. The return of
        electrons to the lower state liberates energy. By the use of
        atoms of suitable electronic configuration and by the periodic
        subjection of such atoms to an electric charge or discharge, the
        electrons may be caused to rapidly move from one arrangement
        into another thereby permitting the utilization of the energy
        liberated by the movement of the electrons from one orbit or
        energy level to another. </p>
      <p>Under the conditions here described, the quantum yield is
        maintained high and by maintaining the radiation above the level
        at which the molecules stay intact, the electronic energy is
        utilized as heat. This is attained, in part at least, by the use
        of substances capable of emitting gamma and beta rays and
        electrons, and the generation of visible light and fluorescence
        whereby large numbers of photons are made available. These
        substances and conditions, together with cyclic changes in
        magnetic field, polarity, and potential supplied to activating
        cells to stimulate radiation, and cyclic generation and
        condensation of vapors in a trapped volume of noble and other
        gases capable of existing in higher energy states, produce
        expansion and contraction or condensation of such trapped gases
        in a controlled cyclic manner, the energy thus produced being
        capable of use in generating power which can be converted into
        rotative or linear forces. </p>
      <p>Since theorists in quantum mechanics may come to conflicting
        opinions and explanations of the same observed results,
        applicant will state facts and observations and describe an
        operative and tested embodiment without excessive discussion of
        theory, applicant being willing to adopt that explanation of
        some aspects of operation which will stand the test of time. </p>
      <p>Among the objects of this invention, I list: </p>
      <p>1. To provide a virtually sealed telescoping chamber of
        variable volume provided with a precharged energy supply having
        a long life, and composed essentially of noble gases and
        substances capable of emitting beta and gamma rays and
        electrons, said chamber being capable of forcibly expanding and
        contracting in volume under the influence of electrical timing
        to thereby be used as a source of controlled energy and power. </p>
      <p>2. To provide a two-cycle reciprocating engine which does not
        use fuel intake valves or exhaust valves, does not require an
        air supply and does not emit exhaust gases. </p>
      <p>3. To provide a precharged engine of the character stated in
        item 2 capable of generating power for a period of from 2000 to
        over 10,000 hours continuously or until mechanical breakdown
        without the addition of fuel, injection of air, or discharge of
        gases. </p>
      <p>4. To provide a low temperature system of converting potential
        energy into kinetic energy. </p>
      <p>5. To provide a system or method of generating power by the use
        of mixtures of gases and substances (referred to in item 1)
        wherein the reactions are cyclic and under control. </p>
      <p>6. To disclose and provide the constructions, elements, and
        components, molecular and atomic fuel compositions and method of
        preparation and operation which exemplify the teachings of this
        invention. </p>
      <p>The invention may be utilized in many fields of endeavor for
        many industrial, scientific and military purposes, both
        terrestrial, in space and under water. For purposes of
        illustration and to facilitate understanding, an exemplary
        reciprocating engine will be described by reference to the
        following drawings in which: </p>
      <p>Fig. 1 is a top or plan view of a single cylinder (of an
        in-line assembly) of an engine embodying aspects of this
        invention. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate a motor block 1 provided with or
        mounted upon a crankcase housing 2; the crankshaft, transmission
        and other conventional elements are not illustrated. The block 1
        is provided with a plurality of parallel bores such as 3, each
        being adapted to receive a cylinder providing a variable volume
        chamber 5. Each cylinder 4 comprises a stationary upper, hollow
        head portion 6 firmly attached by its enlarged head end to the
        upper surface of the block 1, and a movable portion 7 in
        telescopic relation to the skirt 6’ of the head portion 6. The
        lower end of the movable portion 7 is closed and is shown
        provided with an inwardly extending domed surface 7’; this
        movable portion of the hollow cylinder which forms to enclosed
        chamber 5 is shown attached to a lower extension 8 which carries
        the wristpin 9 to which the piston rod 9’ is connected. It is to
        be understood that the parts 7 and 8 may be made integral
        although a removable threaded connection facilitates assembly.
        In Fig. 2, the chamber is shown in its substantially expanded
        position; in actual practice, the chamber is precharged with a
        mixture of gases and an aqueous component and such gases are
        caused to forcibly expand and contract in a repetitive and
        controlled manner as hereafter described. </p>
      <p>The chamber 5 should be substantially gas-tight; in order to
        facilitate the attainment of a gas-tight seal, the lower portion
        7 is shown provided with a steel liner 11 preferably having a
        highly polished or burnished, reflecting internal surface. The
        exterior of the lower end of skirt 6’ of the stationary portion
        6 is shown provided with a series of grooves carrying o-rings of
        suitable material adapted to produce a hermetic seal as at 12.
        The exterior of lower portion 7 is provided with a plurality of
        oil grooves 12’ for distribution of lubricating oil. </p>
      <p>In the form of construction illustrated, the head end of
        cylinder portion 6 is shown connected to the upper end of the
        movable portion 7 by means of a gas retaining bellows 14 which
        may be made of any non-oxidizing, flexible and resilient sheet
        metal, the upper and lower ends of such bellows being suitably
        attached to the head and to the upper end of movable cylinder
        portion 7 as by means of threaded internal rings indicated at
        14’ and 14". A split expansion ring 7’ carried by the upper edge
        of movable portion 7 may be used to prevent separation of the
        chamber portions during installation. The skirt wall 6’ of the
        upper portion is preferably provided with a plurality of check
        valves such as 15 at different distances from the head for
        preventing internal pressure in chamber 5 (or within the
        bellows) from rupturing the bellows. </p>
      <p>The head of the stationary portion 6 is shown provided with
        internally threaded ports adapted to receive and hold in
        gas-tight relation the upper terminal portions of an anode 20, a
        cathode 21, terminals 23 and 23’ of an electrode generally
        indicated at 22, and a centrally located gas inlet fitting
        indicated at 24. Since the polarity and potential of current
        supplied to 20 and 21 is cyclically varied to control the
        expansion and contraction of the trapped charge within chamber
        5, the devices 20 and 21 will be generally referred to as
        activating cells, the current supplied thereto affecting the
        direction and velocity of electrons and rays emanating from the
        cells. </p>
      <p>It has been found that under the conditions hereinafter
        disclosed, many of the noble gases and elements found in the
        periodic table, and particularly their isotopes from periods 2,
        3, 4 and 5 of the periodic table, are capable of being utilized
        as the trapped charge in chamber 5 for operation of the present
        invention. The noble gases are preferred. They do not contain or
        produce acid containing materials; although they can be caused
        to create heat, they will not burn; they are sensitive to and
        respond to radiations, whereupon they radiate themselves. They
        are capable of picking up mutated electrons and their electron
        distances permit electron connections. The noble gases found to
        be most effective are those of neon, argon, krypton and xenon
        and their isotopes. Some of the isotopes are capable of internal
        electron conversion very readily and xenon may be cited as a
        typical example. 11-Xe is an isotope which is particularly
        effective in that it is readily capable of internal conversion.
        Similarly, other gases such as chlorine are unstable in that
        chlorine contains 8 electrons in the 2nd level and only 7
        (instead of 18) in the 3rd level. </p>
      <p>Phosphorus and rubidium and its isotopes are examples of
        elements adapted for use in the activating cells 20 and 21;
        phosphorus contains 8 in the second group and only 5 in the 3rd
        level; rubidium contains 18 I the 3rd level but only 8 in the
        4th level and 1 in the 5th. Mesothorium I or radium D can be
        used in the activating cells to good advantage, although they
        have a shorter half-life than rubidium. Elements useful in the
        activating cells are preferably those capable of emitting
        electrons, alpha rays, beta rays, gamma rays and x-rays,
        negative beta rays being particularly useful since they are
        directed to exert their force (as hereafter described) in the
        direction of the movement of the end wall of the expanding
        chamber. </p>
      <p>Differently considered, it may be stated that the present
        invention utilizes those elements and isotopes which can be
        readily caused to emit alpha rays, beta rays, gamma radiations
        and electrons. In general it may be stated that substances which
        decay by the emission of negative beta particles and which are
        also subject to rearrangement within the atom or decay by
        orbital electron capture, are effective sources of energy in the
        fuel and system of the present invention. </p>
      <p>Similarly, atoms which exhibit alpha particle emission (which
        generally involves strong interaction between nucleons), are
        capable of being utilized. Although alpha decay is normally slow
        and have half-lives which are longer due to electrostatic
        barriers that make it difficult for alpha particles to escape,
        the present invention utilizes periodic discharges of electrical
        energy which speed up the escape of alpha particles and permit
        the reactions to be utilized effectively in the method of the
        present invention. </p>
      <p>For purposes of illustration (and without limitation thereto),
        the following examples of charges, activating cells or ampoules
        and operating conditions are given. The hollow anode and cathode
        cells may be made of stainless steel, aluminum alloys such as
        duraluminum, aluminum alloys containing zinc, antimony and
        cesium. Effective cells were made from an aluminum alloy
        containing antimony and cesium, said cells containing two grams
        of red phosphorus 99.5% pure in argon periodically approaching
        15-20 atmospheres pressure. Anodes were stainless steel vessels
        each containing one gram of rubidium, the vessels being filled
        with 20-30% refined mineral oil and 70-80% argon periodically
        approaching 20 atmospheres pressure. The variable volume
        chambers may contain a precharge composed of between 10% and 25%
        of de-oxygenated water by volume, the remaining volume in the
        chamber being composed of between 35% and 50% of argon, 8% and
        18% of neon, and from about 15% to 25% of xenon and from about
        15% to 25% of chlorine. </p>
      <p>A method of precharging each of the variable volume power
        generating chambers may be carried out in a simple and effective
        manner, as follows: the variable volume chamber comprising the
        portions 6 and 7, together with the activating cells 20 and 21
        in position, may be first filled with de-oxygenated water
        through the fitting 24 while the chamber is in its fully
        expanded position. A mixture of say, 60% neon and 40% chlorine
        is now injected into the cylindrical cavity until about 10% of
        the water is expelled. The contents of the cylinder are then
        cycled, agitated or otherwise mixed to cause some of the
        chlorine to become absorbed by the water. </p>
      <p>A mixture of 60-70% xenon with, say, 30-40% chlorine, is then
        injected into the cylinder until an additional 40% of the
        original volume of decomposed water is expelled by this second
        gas injection. The contents should again be cycled or thoroughly
        agitated. </p>
      <p>With the chamber now containing approximately 50% decomposed
        water by volume, a mixture composed of about 65% argon, 25%
        xenon and 10% neon is injected within the cylinder or chamber in
        a collapsed position until a sufficient amount of water is
        displaced so as to leave within the cylinder between 10% and 25%
        of the water. Thereafter, the cylinder is expanded to maximum
        volume position and the last named gas mixture is injected so as
        to create a pressure within the chamber of between 1 and 3
        atmospheres. The injection fitting 24 is now securely closed and
        the gases therein are ionized by charging with 110 to 440 volt
        current for a period of about 6 hours; a longer time is required
        when the volumes are larger and lower potentials are used on the
        charging current. Ionization of the charge is conveniently
        accomplished by supplying the current through the terminals 20
        and 23 of an actuating cell and adjacent electrode. </p>
      <p>At this point, it may be noted that the terminal posts 23 and
        23’ extend as electrodes 30 and 30’ into the chamber and
        terminate in a pair of opposed platinum spark gap points 31 and
        31’ adapted to produce a glow field under stated conditions of
        operation. The gap between the electrodes may be from 1/16 to ¼
        inch depending upon the construction and size of the chamber.
        The two copper electrodes 30 and 30’ carry between them a
        collector plate 32 which may be made of a copper alloy
        containing magnesium, manganese and aluminum alloy containing
        some zinc sulfide or preferably from an alloy containing
        appreciable quantities of antimony and cesium. As shown in Fig.
        3, the collector plate 32 is suspended from the electrodes by
        means of relatively thin insulators 33 capable of breaking down
        in the event the voltage across the collector 32 and its
        terminals 30, 30’ exceeds about 12 to 24 volts DC. </p>
      <p>Above the collector plate 32, there is mounted a glow coil 34
        (preferably made of wolfram) which may be protected by a
        perforated shroud 35. One end of the coil is connected to
        electrode 30’ and contact with electrode 30 is by way of a
        thermosensitive, bimetallic element 34’ which disconnects the
        glow coil after the initial heating of the environmental gases
        has been accomplished. </p>
      <p>The collector plate 32lies in a plane between the two
        activating cells 20 and 21 as shown in Fig. 2. The preferred
        distance between the two activating cells may vary from ¼ inch
        to ¾ inch. It is important however that the spark gap 31 of the
        electrode assembly extend slightly below the bottom of the two
        activating cells so that when the cylinder or chamber is in its
        collapsed or minimum volume position, the spark gap extends into
        the aqueous medium of de-oxygenated water in the bottom of the
        chamber. Similarly, it is desirable that the extreme lower ends
        of the activating cells contact or are in very close proximity
        to the water in the bottom of the chamber when the chamber is in
        its collapsed position. </p>
      <p>Many virtually instantaneous radiations, reactions, changes in
        energy levels, changes in direction of radiations due to
        electron charges absorbed by the collector plate and
        electromagnetic field effects, luminescence and fluorescence,
        photon electronic absorption and emission, endothermic
        resultants caused by the release of chlorine from the water,
        exothermic results caused by discharges between the points of
        the gap, etc., take place in the chamber. The reversible
        reactions are controlled by the selection of the atomic
        constituents of the charge and activating cells and a unique
        supply of electrical energy. One form of such control system,
        adapted for use with any multiple of two variable volume
        chambers herein before described, is shown in Fig. 4. </p>
      <p>Two variable volume chambers of an engine are illustrated at A
        and B; A is shown at the beginning of an upstroke ad B is show
        at the beginning of a downstroke toward expansion. Activating
        cells are indicated diagrammatically at 20 and 21 and the
        electrodes are indicated at 23 and 23’ with the collector plate
        32 therebetween. During operation of the system, it is desirable
        to supply alternating current as well as direct current and for
        this reason the diagram illustrates an AC generator at 38 and a
        DC generator at 39. The two generators would normally be
        initiated and the entire motor started by means of a starting
        motor and a storage battery. Such conventional starting system
        is illustrated in the lower right hand corner. </p>
      <p>A distributor 40 is diagrammatically illustrated, such
        distributor having an external distribution ring split into two
        sections 41 and 42, each covering slightly less than 180
        degrees. Two diametrically opposed contact brushes or
        spring-urged contact points rotate within the distributor, one
        of the arms 43 being shown beginning its contact with split ring
        section 41, whereas the other arm 52 is shown beginning a
        downstroke in contact with ring 42. It will be noticed that arm
        44 is constantly supplied with alternating current from the
        generator 38 whereas arm 43 is grounded and connected to the
        negative side of DC generator 39. Distributor segment 41 is
        associated with expansion chamber A whereas segment 42 of the
        distributor is associated with the variable volume chamber B.
        Rotation of the contact arms in the distributor is in timed
        relation with the cycles of expansion and contraction of the
        variable volume chambers; since the power sources are of two
        cycle character, one complete rotation of the distributor
        contact arms corresponds to a full cycle of a chamber. </p>
      <p>In the position shown in Fig. 4, it will be noticed that the
        contact arm 43 is now supplying negative (ground) to segment
        41which is connected by line 44 through a condenser 45 to the
        cell 21 and one of the electrodes 23’ of chamber A which is at
        the beginning stage of the upstroke. Simultaneously however,
        contact arm 52 is being supplied from the positive output of the
        generator 38 with alternating current through segment 42 which
        is now transmitted by line 54 through a condenser 55 to the
        corresponding cell 21 and electrode 23’ of variable chamber B
        which is at the beginning of its down or expansion stroke.
        Simultaneously, branch line 54’ (also connected to distributor
        ring 42 and fed with alternating current), passes through a
        voltage regulator and actuates an electromagnetic coil 56 of a
        double pole, single throw, relay switch indicated at 57, whereby
        switch bar portion 58 assumes the full line position, switch bar
        portion 58 assumes the full line position, switch bar 58 being
        connected at its inner end by line 59 to the negative side of
        the AC generator and making contact at terminal 60, connects
        such negative side by line 61 to the opposite electrode 23 and
        cell 20 of expansion chamber B. </p>
      <p>Simultaneously, while the double pole, single throw relay
        switch is in full line position, line 68 is supplying positive
        direct current to the inner end of arm 58’ of the switch which
        is in contact with terminal 72, the opposite end of this
        conductor being connected as at 70 to line 71 which conveys this
        direct positive current to actuating cell 20 and terminal 23
        within variable volume chamber A. </p>
      <p>At this point it is to be noted that during the expansion
        stroke in chamber B, actuating cell 21 is supplied with positive
        alternating current while the opposing activating cell 20 is
        connected to ground or negative terminal. Similarly, the two
        electrodes 23 and 23’ in variable chamber B are supplied with
        negative and positive alternating current. However, during the
        upstroke or contraction of chamber A, which occurs concurrently,
        the system provides positive DC to actuating cell 20 and
        terminal 23 of the electrode whereas negative DC is supplied to
        the opposing activating cell 21 and the opposite terminal of the
        electrode 23’. </p>
      <p>When DC arm 43 completes its sweep of segment 41 and contacts
        segment 42, chamber B starts its upward or contraction stroke.
        Simultaneously arm 52 starts its sweep of segment 41 and chamber
        A starts its expansion stroke. During these strokes, the switch
        57 is in dotted line position (coil 56’ energized through line
        44’). In chamber A actuating cell 20 will be supplied with
        negative alternating current or ground, whereas the opposite
        actuating cell 21 will be supplied with ungrounded alternating
        current. In chamber B (now contracting) cell 20 will be supplied
        with positive DC and cell 21 with negative DC. </p>
      <p>The two cells in a given chamber are therefore sequentially
        supplied with electrical current differing in potential and
        polarity, only one cell of a pair being supplied with positive
        current at a given instant. Supply of electrical current (from
        an external source) to the two electrodes in a given chamber
        conforms to the same rule. Such sequential supply controls
        expansion and contraction of the gaseous environment in the
        chambers. </p>
      <p>The alternating current supply may vary from between about 28
        to 500 volts depending upon the volume of each of the chambers;
        a direct current supply at from approximately 24 to 100 volts is
        adequate. The presence of capacitors 45 and 55 in lines 44 and
        54 is required and will allow the passage of direct current
        since these currents are in effect of a pulsating type. </p>
      <p>Attention is called to the fact that the glow coil 34 is
        located near the top extremities of the collector plate between
        the electrodes. The function of the glow coil is to initially
        preheat the gas mixture of the chamber and the water therein
        during start-up. Although it is connected to the electrodes,
        from the bottom of the stroke to the top of the stroke during
        each cycle, it cannot glow during operation because of the
        bimetallic relay or switch 34’ referred to hereinabove;
        therefore the coil will merely short the electrodes without
        benefit of glow in subsequent phases and will complete the
        circuit between the condenser electrodes, permitting the
        collector plate 32 between the electrodes to receive its charge.
      </p>
      <p>During the up or contraction stroke, the electrodes are
        operating with DC and the collector plate 32 is building up its
        charge potential. The charging of the collector ceases at the
        beginning of the expansion stroke. During the downstroke, the
        electrodes receive AC and, due to this change in the type of
        electrical impulse and variation in voltage, the collector plate
        will short out with high voltage both through the insulators and
        between the electrodes. This discharge is given impetus by the
        moist steam which results during the cooling phase of the
        superheated dry steam from the initiation to the completion of
        the up or contraction stroke. When the chamber is in its
        contracted phase, the charge on the condenser is negative and
        the condenser has excess electrons at the moment of electric
        discharge. The negative charge condenser attracts of absorbs the
        positive molecules. These positive charges are moving toward the
        collector plate and the negative charges will be repelled while
        the positive atoms, which are deficient in electrons, will reach
        the collector plate and pick up the needed electrons form the
        plate. Moreover, the collector plate, because of its charge,
        creates an electric barrier; the charge on the collector plate
        is negative and has excess electrons at the moment of electrical
        discharge in the gap between terminals 31 of the electrodes and
        while the chamber is in its contracted phase. This negative
        charge on the collector attracts or absorbs positive molecules
        which are moving toward the collector, while the negative
        molecules are repelled. The positive atoms which are deficient
        in electrons will reach the collector plate and will pick up the
        needed electrons from the plate. During the expansion of the
        chamber, the positive and negative ions which are created by the
        gamma ray of the cathode will increase in mass instantaneously
        by the assimilation of the electrons supplied by the generator,
        whereby the gross pressure resultant within the chamber is
        increased directly and proportionately. The collision of gas
        atoms and electrons and molecules results in a high heat
        coefficient with resultant gas expansion. The amount of heat
        depends on the charge of the anode and cathode and the charge of
        the collector plate. The rays from the cathode (phosphorus may
        be the element) generally travel in a straight vector but can be
        deflected by an electromagnetic field. Within the chamber, these
        cathode ray particles will be directed downward toward the
        bottom of the cylinder during the expansion stroke from the time
        that the collector plate discharges its static potential
        previously acquired and from the discharge between the points of
        the electrodes which are positioned close to the bottom of the
        cylinder and complete the electric circuit. Owing to the
        presence of ionized gases and water vapor, the electromagnetic
        field which is created this way between the electrodes will be
        the force phenomenon which will attract the otherwise
        directional migrations of the cathode ray particles toward the
        bottom of the chamber. Simultaneously the collector plates
        create an electric barrier above such discharge and field,
        facilitating the downward deflection of the rays in the
        direction of movement of the bottom wall of the chamber. </p>
      <p>In general there are two forces working in the cylinder, one
        force is the resultant of the anode, cathode and collector plate
        short-circuiting and changing the moist steam to a superheated
        dry steam. The second force is a resultant due to the high
        temperature/pressure coefficient of the gases and the
        directional electrons emanating from the rubidium and phosphorus
        for example, whose velocity is increased by the electrical
        impulses to which they are subjected. These free electrons are
        absorbed by the gases which are capable of assimilating these
        electrons due to their special nature. The collector plate
        located between the two cells also attracts some free electrons
        and adds them to its charge. When rubidium is in one of the
        cells, it radiates gamma rays which have no negative or positive
        charge and will not be absorbed by the gases nor the electric
        components of the cylinder but will cause structural changes in
        the molecules of the argon which has been subjected to the
        radiation from the other cell containing phosphorus, and which
        has been subjected to the supplied AC and DC. The working
        capacity and the life expectancy of the environment is dependent
        upon the percentage of the various gases in the mixture, the
        percentage of water and the quantity and character of the
        elements in the two activating cells. The causes of the energy
        produced in this environment are eclectic and are a function of
        the molecular structures and atomic substructures connected with
        and altered by the electrons migrating and the molecules of
        hydrogen and oxygen which are sequentially bound and released
        due to the interplay of the elements and electrical forces
        interacting upon the system. </p>
      <p>During operation, a certain amount of fluorescence and
        luminosity is highly desirable within the chambers and in order
        to stimulate such fluorescence and the emanations from the
        activating cells, these cells are sequentially supplied with
        current as previously stated. Electron emissions are therefore
        stimulated or induced and the electrons from one cell are
        attracted toward the other cell, the flow of these electrons
        resulting in electric current. The strength or potential of this
        current can be increased by the presence of the noble gases in
        the chamber as well as their quantity and pressure within the
        chamber. The presence of these gases aids the flow of the
        current EMF) because the flow of electrons from the cathode will
        be accelerated sufficiently so that collision of the electrons
        with the gas molecules and atoms occurs, causing fission of the
        neutral gas atoms and particles permitting them to carry a
        greater electrical charge (this may be called collision
        ionization). The cathode also emits beta rays and gamma rays.
        The gamma rays will induce certain materials to radiate
        fluorescent light and this has a special function at the
        expanded position of the chamber and aid by cooling the walls of
        the cylinders. Heat is removed from the cylinder walls because
        elementary particles are retrieved from the walls, such
        particles having previously emanated from the cathode rays. </p>
      <p>Within the confines of the chamber, the gas molecules collide
        with the walls and other gas molecules and change direction;
        oppositely moving positive and negative molecules attract each
        other but the neutral molecules will not be able to participate
        in this current. To increase the number of charged particles
        which are responsible for the state which causes electrical
        power, we increase the speed so as to reduce the number of
        recombinations which tends to result in neutral equilibrium. If
        the molecular velocity is sufficient, it will tend to inhibit
        reassociation of gas atoms to reduce the electric ionic charges
        available to support an electric current and if we sustain
        sufficient atomic velocity of the gases, we tend to increase the
        electric the electric current potential. By further increasing
        the power source of motion, the charged molecules will speed up
        so fast that collisions with neutral molecules will explode them
        to nascent particles which are capable of taking charges and the
        forces acting upon them will begin to move the charged particles
        in positive and negative directions and into further collisions
        where they create new charge-carrying particles. X-rays created
        by the cathode knock out or dislodge atoms from the xenon in the
        chamber and atoms that have lost one or more of their electrons
        will suffer an electron deficiency. By reason of this, the atom
        which has lost its electron will have a positive electric charge
        and the free electrons will be picked up by the argon, neon and
        krypton isotopes. The gas which accepts the free electrons will
        have a negative charge. The xenon will replace its lost
        electrons form electrons assimilated from the collector plate
        surplus. The charge on the collector is negative as previously
        stated. </p>
      <p>The element in one of the cells should be capable of emanating
        alpha ray particles so as to produce a fluorescence or
        luminescence which encourages beta and gamma propagation.
        Phosphorus, mesothorium, or radium can be so employed, the
        latter elements permitting the utilization of additional
        charges. The alpha ray particles collide with the zinc sulfide
        crystals on the collection plate. Moreover, the aforesaid
        elements also create ultraviolet rays which also force electrons
        to emanate from the zinc, aluminum, or other metals employed for
        the housings of the cells. The photons thus obtained by the
        luminescence are of value in that their removal from the metal
        walls assists in cooling. </p>
      <p>During the upstroke or contraction, AC is withdrawn and DC is
        supplied to the cells and electrodes from the distributor. </p>
      <p>The "Neutral Electrons" which are forced to explode, loose
        their charges and will again become "Neutral Electrons" since
        the collector will retrieve their charges (The theory of
        "Neutral Electrons" evolving suggests that electrons with a
        given mass when carrying a charge of electricity are in negative
        phase but may be stripped of their charge and revert to a
        positive condition devoid of the electrical charge normally
        attributed to them). The xenon is in need of charges and will
        reassimilate its lost electrons from the argon and neon. The
        huge electron surplus originally admitted via the cathode will
        migrate through the closed circuit of the flow coil shunt or
        relay and will drain excess electrons to the generator which is
        extraneous to the internal electron system. A collector plate or
        electron sink between the electrodes and the distributor
        modulates the exodus of electron surpluses. The quantity of
        electrons which are returned by the distributor at the top of
        the stroke, combined with the low EMF current from the generator
        results in a very powerful charge to the previously charged
        collector plate inside the cylinder, resulting in a high
        magnitude explosive discharge at the top of the stroke. The
        radiation of the phosphorus (or alternates) placed in the
        cathode will be reduced, almost stopped (with the exception of
        the gamma ray) because the current of electrons will now have
        opposite direction (polarity) which will result in opposite
        charge, owing to the change of polarity mentioned above. The
        same thing will happen with the rubidium in the anode, and even
        its radiating capacity will be intensified to a certain degree,
        with the aid of the charge-laden electron current. The
        charge-laden electron stream entering the anode from the
        generator will have a negative charge and will pick up the
        particle and electrons which were eliminated by the gases and
        will circulate them from the anode to the cathode. The same will
        happen with the electrons and particles which will be released
        from the cylinder wall and which will result with the aid of
        water vapor in a diminution or loss of sensible heat. The
        cylinder wall will cool and it will cool the hot gases and the
        high-pressure dry water steam. Small amounts of water vapor will
        even condense on the cylinder wall. Total and complete
        condensation of the water and cooling cannot occur because
        within a fraction of a second, the heating cycle will commence.
        The rubidium rays will be (alpha and gamma) intensified during
        the reversed polarity upstroke cycle. At the moment of the next
        discharge between gap points of the electrode, 80 to 85% of the
        water will become moist steam and 15 to 20% will condense to
        liquid water. The resultant residue will settle on the cylinder
        wall and will be chemically harmless, because it consists only
        of the atrophied electrons of the electricity. </p>
      <p>A complete 4-cylinder engine made in accordance with this
        invention wherein the movable wall portions of the four variable
        volume chambers were connected to a crank shaft of an engine so
        as to convert the linear reciprocation of such wall portions
        into rotary motion was constructed and successfully operated and
        demonstrated. Each of the cylinders had a gross volume of 8-1/2
        cubic inches and a net displacement of 5.5 cubic inches. The
        activating cells in each cylinder contained 1 gram of rubidium
        and 2 grams of phosphorus respectively, and were made in
        accordance with the specific example given hereinbefore. The
        environment within each chamber had the composition given
        hereinbefore consisting of de-oxygenated water, xenon, neon,
        argon and chlorine. The precharging method hereinbefore
        disclosed was employed. The electrical energy sources utilized
        were direct current at 27 volts and alternating current at 42
        volts. </p>
      <p>Starting of the engine occurred after 4 to 6 revolutions of the
        engine by a conventional starting motor. The timing of the
        distributor during the operation of the engine was advanced to
        initiate changes in type of current supplied to the activating
        cells a few degrees in advance of top dead center. The engine
        accelerated rapidly (to about 1500 rpm in less than one second)
        and then at a somewhat slower rate to between 2500 and 3000 rpm
        (attained in less than 2 seconds from start). Although electron
        reactions involving temperatures on the order of 2000-3000
        degrees occur at the peak in the expansion portion of the cycle,
        the walls of the engine showed a temperature of 75-80 degrees at
        the end of protracted runs. No cooling water was employed; a
        circulating oil system injected some oil through the wall of the
        block into the outer grooves of the movable wall portion of each
        chamber cylinder. Momentary pressures of between 700 and 800 psi
        appear to have been developed within the chambers. The engine
        was quiet during operation. A power output of about 70 hp was
        apparently produced at 2500 rpm </p>
      <p>Rectilinear motion of the movable wall portion of the variable
        volume chamber or chambers (which is obtained in accordance with
        the ode of operation described hereinabove) may be changed or
        translated into rotary motion, intermittent motion or
        rectilinear motion or practically uniform velocity by the use of
        many different types of mechanisms which are within the skill of
        mechanical engineers and designers. The shafts, arms, rods,
        linkages or other force transfer means energized by the power
        source of the present invention may be used for the
        manipulation, adjustment, positioning, lifting, etc. of any
        desired device or element. The regenerative two-cycle character
        of the example given herein, its compactness, ability to provide
        high energy output at relatively low rpm (1500-3600), the simple
        construction (no valves or valve actuating mechanisms, cooling
        systems, air supply or superchargers, no exhaust or muffler) and
        light weight, as well as the ability of the system to operate
        for thousands of hours without refueling or recharging, provides
        solutions to present and future problems involving the
        generation and utilization of power in isolated locations and
        under exotic conditions. </p>

      <p>An inert gas fuel consisting essentially of a precise,
        homogeneous mixture of helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon.
        Apparatus for preparing the fuel includes a mixing chamber,
        tubing to allow movement of each inert gas into and through the
        various stages of the apparatus, a plurality of electric coils
        for producing magnetic fields, an ion gauge, ionizers, cathode
        ray tubes, filters, a polarizer and a high frequency generator.
        An engine for extracting useful work from the fuel has at least
        two closed cylinders for fuel, each cylinder being defined by a
        head and a piston. A plurality of electrodes extend into each
        chamber, some containing low level radioactive material. The
        head has a generally concave depression facing a generally
        semi-toroidal depression in the surface of the piston. The
        piston is axially movable with respect to the head from a first
        position to a second position and back, which linear motion is
        converted to rotary motion by a crankshaft. The engine's
        electrical system includes coils and condensers which circle
        each cylinder, an electric generator, and circuitry for
        controlling the flow of current within the system. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>Background of the Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to closed reciprocating engines, i.e.,
        ones which do not require an air supply and do not emit exhaust
        gases, and more particularly to such engines which use inert
        gases as fuel. It also concerns such inert gas fuels and
        apparatus for preparing same. </p>
      <p>Currently available internal combustion engines suffer from
        several disadvantages. They are inefficient in their utilization
        of the energy present in their fuels. The fuel itself is
        generally a petroleum derivative with an ever-increasing price
        and sometimes limited availability. And the burning of such fuel
        normally results in pollutants which are emitted into the
        atmosphere. These engines require oxygen and, therefore, are
        particularly unsuitable in environments, such as underwater or
        outer space, in which gaseous oxygen is relatively unavailable.
        Present internal combustion engines are, furthermore, relatively
        complex with a great number of moving parts. Larger units, such
        as fossil-fuel electric power plants, escape some of the
        disadvantages of the present internal combustion engine, but
        not, inter alia, those of pollution, price of fuel and
        availability of fuel. </p>
      <p>Several alternative energy sources have been proposed, such as
        the sun (through direct solar power devices), nuclear fission
        and nuclear fusion. But because of lack of public acceptance,
        cost, other pollutants, technical problems, and/or lack of
        development, these sources have not wholly solved the problem. </p>
      <p>Moreover, the preparation of fuel for nuclear fission and
        nuclear fusion reactors has heretofore been a complicated
        process requiring expensive apparatus. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of the Invnetion ~</b> </p>
      <p>Among the several objects of the present invention may be noted
        the provision of an engine which is efficient; the provision of
        an engine which does not require frequent refueling; the
        provision of an engine which develops no pollutants in
        operation; the provision of an engine which is particularly
        suited for use in environments devoid of free oxygen; the
        provision of an engine which requires no oxygen in operation;
        the provision of an engine having a relatively small number of
        moving parts; the provision of an engine of a relatively simple
        construction; the provision of an engine which can be used in
        light and heavy-duty applications; the provision of an engine
        which is relatively inexpensive to make and operate; the
        provision of a fuel which uses widely available components; the
        provision of a fuel which is relatively inexpensive; the
        provision of a fuel which is not a petroleum derivative; the
        provision of relatively simple and inexpensive apparatus for
        preparing inert gases for use as a fuel; the provision of such
        apparatus which mixes inert gases in precise, predetermined
        ratios; and the provision of such apparatus which eliminates
        contaminants from the inert gas mixture. Other objects and
        features will be in part apparent and in part pointed out
        hereinafter. </p>
      <p>Briefly, in one aspect the engine of the present invention
        includes a head having a generally concave depression therein,
        the head defining one end of a chamber, a piston having a
        generally semitoroidal depression in its upper surface, the
        piston defining the other end of the chamber, and a plurality of
        electrodes extending into the chamber for exciting and igniting
        the working fluid. The piston is axially movable with respect to
        the head from a first position to a second position and back,
        the volume of the chamber being determined by the position of
        the piston relative to the head. </p>
      <p>In another aspect, the engine of the present invention includes
        a head which defines one end of the chamber, a piston which
        defines the other end of the chamber, a plurality of magnetic
        coils wound around the chamber for generating magnetic fields
        inside the chamber, and at least four electrodes extending into
        the chamber for exciting and igniting the working fluid. The
        piston is axially movable with respect to the head from a first
        position to a second position and back, the volume of the
        chamber being determined by the position of the piston relative
        to the head. The magnetic coils are generally coaxial with the
        chamber. The electrodes are generally equidistantly spaced from
        the axis of the chamber and are each disposed generally
        90.degree. from the adjacent electrodes. Lines between opposed
        pairs of electrodes intersect generally on the axis of the
        chamber to define a focal point. </p>
      <p>In a further aspect, the engine of the present invention
        includes a head which defines one end of a chamber, a piston
        which defines the other end of the chamber, at least two
        electric coils wound around the chamber for generating magnetic
        fields inside the chamber, and a plurality of electrodes
        extending into the chamber for exciting and igniting the working
        fluid. The piston is axially movable with respect to the head
        from a first position to a second position and back, the volume
        of the chamber being determined by the position of the piston
        relative to the head. The electric coils are generally coaxial
        with the chamber. And the working fluid includes a mixture of
        inert gases. </p>
      <p>The apparatus of the present invention for preparing a mixture
        of inert gases for use as a fuel includes a chamber, electric
        coils for generating predetermined magnetic fields inside the
        chamber, tubing adapted to be connected to sources of
        preselected inert gases for flow of the gases from the sources
        to the chamber, and ionizers for ionizing the gases. </p>
      <p>The fuel of the present invention includes a mixture of inert
        gases including approximately 36% helium, approximately 26%
        neon, approximately 17% argon, approximately 13% krypton, and
        approximately 8% xenon by volume . </p>

      <p><b>Description of a Preferred Embodiment ~</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings, there is shown in FIG. 1 a
        two-cylinder engine 11 comprising a block 13 preferably of a
        nonmagnetic material such as aluminum, a nonmagnetic head 15,
        and a pair of cylinder heads 17A and 17B of a magnetizable
        material such as 0.1-0.3% carbon steel. Also shown in FIG. 1 is
        a flywheel 19 attached to a crankshaft 21, a generator 23, a
        high-voltage coil 25, a distributor 27 attached by a gear
        arrangement shown in part at 29 to the crankshaft, and an
        electrical cable 31 which is connected to the distributor and to
        both cylinders. Cable 31 (see FIG. 2) is also electrically
        connected to a switching unit 33 which preferably comprises a
        plurality of silicon controlled rectifiers (SCRs) or
        transistors. Also shown in FIG. 2 is a second electrical
        connection of the cable to the cylinders, which connection is
        indicated generally at 35. Turning to FIG. 3, there is shown a
        starter motor 37 as well as a clearer view of the connections 35
        to each cylinder. </p>
      <p>A cross section of the engine is shown in FIG. 4. The cylinder
        heads have associated therewith pistons, designated 39A and 39B,
        respectively, the heads and pistons defining opposite ends of a
        pair of chambers or cylinders 41A and 41B respectively. The
        pistons are made of a magnetizable material. Although only two
        chambers are shown, the engine can include any number. It is
        preferred, however, for reasons set forth below, that there be
        an even number of cylinders. Pistons 39A and 39B move axially
        with respect to their correspoding heads from a first position
        (the position of piston 39A in FIG. 4) to a second position (the
        position of piston 39B) and back, each piston being suitably
        connected to crankshaft 21. As shown in FIG. 4, this suitable
        connection can include a connecting rod CR, a wrist pin WP, and
        a lower piston portion or power piston LP. The connecting rods
        and/or power pistons must be of non-magnetizable material. When
        a split piston is used, pistons 39A and 39B are suitably
        connected to lower piston portions LP by bolting, spring-loaded
        press fitting, or the like. Pistons 39A and 39B are attached
        180.degree. apart from each other with respect to the crankshaft
        so that when one piston is at top dead center (TDC) the other
        will be at bottom dead center (BDC) and vice versa. Additional
        pairs of cylinders may be added as desired but the pistons of
        each pair should be attached to the crankshaft 180.degree. from
        each other. Of course, the relative position of each piston with
        respect to its respective head determines the volume of its
        chamber. </p>
      <p>Integral with the piston bodies are walls 43 which form the
        walls of the chambers. Preferably, a set of air-tight bellows
        45, of similar construction to that sold under the designation
        ME 197-0009-001 by the Belfab Company of Daytona Beach, Fla.,
        are suitably secured between walls 43 and cylinder heads 17A and
        17B respectively to form an airtight seal between each piston
        and its cylinder head. While walls 43 and piston 39 can be made
        of one magnetizable piece, a preferable and more efficient
        construction has walls 43 separate from piston 39 and made of a
        non-magnetizable material. The length of time that a given
        engine will run is a function of the efficacy of its sealing
        system. Means, such as bellows 45, for hermetically sealing the
        cylinders will optimize said length of time. Such a hermetic
        seal should be secured between walls 43 and cylinder heads 17 to
        form an airtight seal therebetween. This seal could be the
        airtight bellows system shown or some other sealing system such
        as an oil sealing system. </p>
      <p>Cylinder bodies 47 (see FIG. 4), made of nonmagnetic material
        such as stainless steel, extend from the point of attachment of
        each bellows to its cylinder head to the base of the
        corresponding pistons, forming sleeves for each piston in which
        each piston moves. Three sets of electric coils 49A, 49B, 51A,
        51B, and 53A, 53B, are wound around sleeves 47, and hence around
        chambers 41A and 41B, respectively, for generating magnetic
        fields in the chambers, said coils being generally coaxial with
        their respective chambers. Each of these coils has an inductance
        of approximately 100 mH. It is preferred that 14-19 gauge wire
        be used to wind these coils and that the coils be coated with a
        suitable coating, such as #9615 hardener from Furane Plastics,
        Inc., of Los Angeles, Calif. or the coating sold by the
        Epoxylite Corp. of South El Monte, Calif. under the trade
        designation Epoxylite 8683. Each chamber is also surrounded by a
        pair of capacitors, C1A, C1B and C2A, C2B wound therearound,
        capacitors C1A, C1B having a capacitance of approximately 1.3
        micro-F and capacitors C2A, C2B having a capacitance of
        approximately 2.2 micro-F. The coils and capacitors are potted
        in hardened epoxy of fiberglass material 55. The epoxy resin and
        hardener sold under the designations EPI Bond 121 and #9615
        hardener by Furane Plastics, supra, are satisfactory, but other
        epoxy material which will remain stable at temperatures up to
        200.degree. F. would probably also be acceptable. It is
        preferred that a small amount of graphite such as that sold
        under the trade designation Asbury 225 by Asbury Graphite, Inc.
        of Rodeo, Calif., be included in the epoxy potting to prevent
        nucelar particles formed in the chamber from escaping from the
        apparatus. Ten to 15% graphite to epoxy by weight is more than
        enough. </p>
      <p>A typical cylinder is shown in section in FIG. 5, showing the
        piston in its fully extended position with respect to the head
        and showing many details on a somewhat larger scale than that of
        FIG. 4. A set of seals 57, made of a material such as that sold
        under the trade designation Teflon by the DuPont Company of
        Delaware, is disposed between the cylinder head and wall 43 to
        prevent escape of the working fluid from chamber 41. A filler
        tube 59 with a ball valve at its lower end is used in filling
        the chamber with the working fluid but is closed during
        operation of the engine. </p>
      <p>The cylinder head has a generally concave depression therein,
        indicated at 61, which defines the top end of the chamber. A
        plurality of electrodes for exciting and igniting the working
        fluid extend through the cylinder head into the chamber. Two of
        those electrodes, shown in section in FIG. 5 and labelled 63 and
        65, have tungsten points 75 (see infra), while the other two,
        labelled 67 and 69 (see FIG. 6 for electrode 69) are containers
        called, respectively, the anode and the cathode. The electrodes
        are generally equidistantly spaced from the axes of their
        chambers and are generally coplanar to each other, their mutual
        plane being perpendicular to the axes of their chambers. Each
        electrode is disposed 90.degree. from adjacent electrodes in
        this embodiment and are generally disposed such that a line from
        the anode to the cathode and a line between the other two
        electrodes intersect at a focal point generally on the axis of
        the respective chamber. The radial distance of each electrode
        from the focal point is fixed for a reason discussed below. The
        general construction of electrodes 63 and 65 is shown in FIGS.
        6-9. These electrodes include a conductive rod 71 (see FIG. 7)
        preferably of brass or copper; a conductive, generally
        rectangular plate 73 (see FIGS. 6, 8 and 9); and tungsten point
        75 mounted in a conductive base 77 generally at right angles to
        the plate (see FIGS. 8 and 9). </p>
      <p>The construction of the anode and cathode is shown in FIG. 10.
        Each includes a conductive rod 79 and a container 81. The
        cathode container is substantially pure aluminum. If desired,
        aluminum alloys with, e.g., less than 5% copper, 1% manganese
        and 2% magnesium may be used. In one embodiment, the cathode
        container contains approximately four grams of thorium-232 and
        is filled with argon. In this same embodiment the anode
        container is copper or brass and contains approximately two
        grams of rubidium-37 and approximately three grams of
        phosphorus-15 hermetically sealed in mineral oil. In a second
        embodiment, the cathode is still aluminum, but it contains at
        least two grams of rubidium-37 in addition to the approximately
        four grams of thorium-232 in either argon or mineral oil. In
        this second embodiment, the anode is also aluminum and contains
        at least 4 grams of phosphorus-15 and at least 2 grams of
        thorium-232 in argon or mineral oil. Alternatively, mesothorium
        may be used for the thorium, strontium-38 may be used for the
        rubidium, and sulfur-16 may be used for the phosphorus. Rods 71
        and 79 respectively extend through cylinder head 17 to the
        exterior thereof where electrical connections are made to the
        electrodes. Each rod is surrounded by one of four insulating
        sleeves 83, the lower portion of each of which being flared
        outwardly to firmly seat in the cylinder head. </p>
      <p>The piston has a generally semitoroidal depression in its upper
        surface (see FIGS. 4, 5 and 11) and carries a conductive
        discharge point 85 of copper, brass or bronze generally along
        the axis of the chamber. When the piston is generally extended,
        the discharge point is a substantial distance from the
        electrodes. But when the piston is in its upper position (see
        FIG. 11), the discharge point is disposed generally intermediate
        all four electrodes and in close proximity thereto, there being
        gaps between said electrodes and the discharge point. When the
        piston is in this upper position, the electrodes extend somewhat
        into the semitoroidal depression in the piston's upper surface
        and the chamber is generally toroidal in shape. The volume of
        the chamber shown in FIG. 11 can be from approximately 6.0 cubic
        inches (100 cm.sup.3) or larger. Given the present state of the
        art, 1500 cubic inches (25,000 cm.sup.3) appears to be the upper
        limit. A plurality of ports 87 and one-way valves 89 return
        working fluid which escapes from the chamber back thereto, so
        long as a sealing system such as bellows 45 is used. </p>
      <p>An alternative cylinder head/piston arrangement is shown in
        FIG. 12. The main difference between this arrangement and that
        of FIG. 5 is that the chamber walls, here labelled 43' are
        integrally formed with the head. As a result seals 57 are
        carried by the piston rather than by the head, the attachment of
        bellows 45 is somewhat different, and the fluid-returning valves
        and ports are part of the piston rather than of the head.
        Otherwise these arrangements are substantially the same.
        Preferably, the cylinders of both arrangements are hermetically
        sealed. </p>
      <p>An additional embodiment of a cylinder head/piston arrangement
        used in the present invention is shown in FIG. 12A. In this
        arrangement, a tapered sleeve 17C is disposed in mating relation
        between cylinder head 17 and piston 39, a plurality of seals 57
        are provided, and electrodes 67 and 69 have a somewhat different
        shape. Moreover, in this embodiment a chamber 90 is provided in
        cylinder head 17 for storing additional working fluid, i.e., the
        purpose of chamber 90 is to extend the operating time between
        refueling by circulating the working fluid, viz. the mixture of
        inert gases described infra, between cylinder 41 and chamber 90
        as needed so that the reactions in cylinder 41 are not adversely
        affected. To accomplish this, this embodiment further includes a
        two-way circulation valve 90B, a relief valve 90C, and duct or
        passageway 90D for evacuating and filling chamber 90, a duct or
        passageway 90E for evacuating and filling cylinder 41, a
        passageway 90F between chamber 90 and cylinder 41 in which
        two-way valve 90B is disposed, a sensor 90G and a plurality of
        small pressure relief holes 90H. Relief holes 90H serve to
        relieve the pressure on bellows 45 as the piston moves from BDC
        to TDC. In larger engines holes 90H should be replaced with one
        way valves. Two-way valve 90B is either controlled by sensor 90G
        or is manually operable, as desired, to allow the circulation of
        gases between chamber 90 and cylinder 41. The sensor itself
        detects a condition requiring the opening or closing of valve
        90B and signals that condition to the valve. For example, sensor
        90G can measure pressure in cylinder 41 while the piston is at
        top dead center. A predetermined cylinder pressure can cause a
        spring to compress, causing the valve to open or close as
        appropriate. A subsequent change in the cylinder pressure would
        then cause another change in the valve. Another sensor (not
        shown) could measure the physical location of the piston by a
        physical trip switch or an electric eye, or it could measure
        angular distance from top dead center on the distributor or the
        crankshaft. The sensor must keep the gas pressure in chamber 90
        at one atmosphere .+-.5% and, at top dead center, cylinder 41
        should also be at that pressure. If gas is lost from the system,
        it is more important to maintain the proper pressure in cylinder
        41. Alternatively, a small passage between cylinder 41 and
        chamber 90 could function in a passive manner to satisfactorily
        accomplish the same result. From the above, it can be seen that
        this embodiment utilizes the hollowed out center of the cylinder
        head for storing additional working fluid, which fluid is
        circulated between chamber 90 and cylinder 41 through a valving
        system comprising valve 90B and sensor 90G with the moving
        piston causing the gases to circulate. </p>
      <p>The electrical circuitry for engine 11 includes (see FIG. 13A)
        a 24 V battery B1, an ignition switch SW1, a starter swich SW2,
        starter motor 37, a main circuit switch SW4, a step-down
        transformer 93 (e.g., a 24 V to 3.5 V transformer), a switch SW6
        for supplying power to ignition coil 25 (shown in FIGS. 13A and
        13B as two separate ignition coils 25A and 25B), and various
        decoupling diodes. </p>
      <p>The circuitry of FIG. 13A also includes a high frequency
        voltage source or oscillator 95 for supplying rapidly varying
        voltage through two electronic current regulators 97A, 97B (see
        FIG. 13B for regulator 97B) to the anode and cathode electrodes
        of each cylinder, and a high voltage distributor 99 for
        distributing 40,000 volt pulses to the cylinders. Distributor 99
        has two wipers 99A and 99B and supplies three pulses to each
        cylinder per cycle. Wipers 99A and 99B are 180.degree. out of
        phase with each other and each operates to supply pulses to its
        respective cylinder from TDC to 120.degree. thereafter. More
        pulses are desirable and therefore a better distributor
        arrangement (shown in FIG. 14) may be used. The arrangement
        shown in FIG. 14 includes two ignition coils 101, 103, a simple
        distributor 105 and a pair of magnetic ignition circuits 107,
        109, described below. Of course many other ignition systems
        could also be developed. For example, a single circuit might be
        used in place of circuits 107, 109, additional induction coils
        might be added to the ignition coils to assist in starting or a
        resistor could be added to the ignition coils to ensure a
        constant 40,000 volt output regardless of engine rpm. Moreover,
        a solid-state distributor could be used instead of the
        mechanical distributor labelled 99. </p>
      <p>Referring back to FIG. 13A, for engines of more than 1000 hp a
        high frequency source 95 could be used to control engine RPM.
        The output frequency is controlled by a foot pedal similar to an
        accelerator pedal in a conventional automobile. The output
        frequency varies through a range of from approximately 2.057 MHz
        to approximately 27.120 MHz with an output current of
        approximately 8.4 amps. The speed of engine 11 is controlled by
        the output frequency of source 95. The high frequency current,
        as described infra, is directed to each cylinder in turn by
        circuitry described infra. For engines producing from 300 to
        1000 hp (not shown), a high frequency source having a constant
        output of 27.120 MHz with a constant current of 3.4 amps which
        is continually supplied to all cylinders could be used. In this
        case an autotransformer, such as that sold under the trade
        designation Variac by the General Radio Company, controlled by a
        foot pedal varies the voltage to each cylinder from 5 to 24
        volts d.c. at 4.5 amps, using power from the batteries or the
        alternator. The d.c. current from the Variac is switched from
        cylinder to cylinder by two small electronic switching units
        which in turn are controlled by larger electronic switching
        units. For the smallest engines (not shown), a high frequency
        generator could supply a constant output of 27.120 MHz with a
        constant current of 4.2 amps to the cylinders during starting
        only. Speed control would be achieved by a Variac as described
        above which controls the d.c. voltage supplied to the cylinders
        in turn within a range of from 5 to 24 volts at a current of 5.2
        amps. In this case, once the engine is running, the full voltage
        needed to ignite the (smaller) quantity of gases is obtained
        from the electrodes in the other cylinder of the pair. </p>
      <p>The circuitry of FIG. 13A also includes the generator, a
        voltage regulator and relay 111, five electronic switching units
        113, 115, 117, 119 and 121, electrodes 63 and 65 associated with
        chamber 41A (hereinafter chamber 41A is sometimes referred to as
        the "A" cylinder and chamber 41B is sometimes referred to as the
        "B" cylinder), anode 67, cathode 69, magnetic coils 49A, 51A and
        53A, capacitors C1A and C2A, and various decoupling diodes. The
        electronic switching units can take a variety of forms. For
        example, one simple form (see FIG. 15) includes a pair of SCRs
        123 and 125. The switching unit is connected at terminal IN to
        the corresponding line on the input side and at terminal OUT to
        the corresponding line on the output side. When a voltage of 3.5
        volts is supplied from the battery through a distributor, for
        example, to the ON terminal, SCR 125 conducts, thereby
        completing a circuit through the switching unit. Conversely,
        when 3.5 volts is applied to the OFF terminal, SCR 123 conducts
        and the circuit is broken. Likewise, the circuit for regulators
        97A and 97B (see FIG. 16) includes two SCRs 127 and 129 and a
        PNP transistor 131. In this circuit when SCR 127 is gated on, it
        forces transistor 131 into conduction, thereby completing the
        circuit through the regulator. When SCR 129 is gated on, the
        circuit through transistor 131 is broken. A number of other
        configurations may be used in place of those of FIGS. 15 and 16
        and not all would use SCRs. For example, one triode could be
        used to replace two main SCRs, or transistors could be used
        instead of SCRs. </p>
      <p>A pair of low-voltage distributors 135 and 137 are also shown
        in FIG. 13A. Distributors 135 and 137 provide gating pulses for
        the electronic switching units of FIGS. 13A and 13B. Of course,
        solid-state distributors could also replace mechanical
        distributors 135 and 137. </p>
      <p>In addition, the engine circuitry includes (see FIG. 13B) five
        electronic switching units 143, 145, 147, 149 and 151
        corresponding to units 113, 115, 117, 119 and 121 of FIG. 13A,
        electrodes 63 and 65 of the "B" cylinder, anode 67, cathode 69,
        electric coils 49B, 51B and 53B, capacitors C1B and C2B, and
        various decoupling diodes. The circuitry of FIG. 13B is
        generally the same as the corresponding portions of FIG. 13A, so
        the description of one for the most part applies to both. Of
        course, if more than two cylinders are used, each would have
        associated therewith circuitry such as that shown in FIGS. 13A
        and 13B. The circuitry of FIG. 13A is connected to that of FIG.
        13B by a plurality of line L1-L17. </p>
      <p>The working fluid and the fuel for the engine are one and the
        same and consist of a mixture of inert gases, which mixture
        consists essentially of helium, neon, argon, krypton and xenon.
        It is preferred that the mixture contain 35.6% helium, 26.3%
        neon, 16.9% argon, 12.7% krypton, and 8.5% xenon by volume, it
        having been calculated that this particular mixture gives the
        maximum operation time without refueling. Generally, the initial
        mixture may contain, by volume, approximately 36% helium,
        approximately 26% neon, approximately 17% argon, approximately
        13% krypton, and approximately 8% xenon. This mixture results
        from a calculation that equalizes the total charge for each of
        the gases used after compensating for the fact that one inert
        gas, viz. randon, is not used. The foregoing is confirmed by a
        spectroscopic flashing, described infra, that occurs during the
        mixing process. If one of the gases in the mixture has less than
        the prescribed percentage, it will become over-excited.
        Similarly, if one of the gases has more than the prescribed
        percentage, that gas will be under-excited. These percentages do
        not vary with the size of the cylinder. </p>
      <p>Operation of the engine is as follows: At room temperature,
        each cylinder is filled with a one atmosphere charge of the fuel
        mixture of approximately 6 cubic inches (100 cm.sup.3)/cylinder
        (in the case of the smallest engine) by means of filler tube 59.
        The filler tubes are then plugged and the cylinders are
        installed in the engine as shown in FIG. 4, one piston being in
        the fully extended position and the other being in the fully
        retracted position. To start the engine, the ignition and
        starter switches are closed, as is switch SW6. This causes the
        starter motor to crank the engine, which in turn causes the
        wiper arms of the distributors to rotate. The starting process
        begins, for example, when the pistons are in the positions shown
        in FIG. 4. Ignition coil 25 and distributor 99 (see FIG. 13A)
        generate a 40,000 volt pulse which is supplied to electrode 65
        of chamber 41A. Therefore, a momentary high potential exists
        between electrodes 63 and 65 and the plates on each. The
        discharge point on piston 39A is adjacent these electrodes at
        this time and sparks occur between one or more of the electrodes
        and the discharge point to partially excite, e.g. ionize, the
        gaseous fuel mixture. </p>
      <p>The gaseous fuel mixture in cylinder 41A is further excited by
        magnetic fields set up in the chamber by coil 49A. This coil is
        connected to the output side of electronic switching unit 121
        and, through switching unit 113, to the battery and the
        generator. At this time, i.e., between approximately 5.degree.
        before TDC and TDC, distributor 135 is supplying a gating signal
        to unit 121. Any current present on the input side of unit 121,
        therefore, passes through unit 121 to energize coil 49A.
        Moreover, high frequency current from oscillator 95 is supplied
        via regulator 97A to coil 49A. This current passes through
        regulator and relay 97A because the gating signal supplied from
        distributor 135 to unit 121 is also supplied to relay 97A. The
        current from switching unit 121 and from oscillator 95 also is
        supplied to the anode and the cathode. It is calculated that
        this causes radioactive rays (x-rays) to flow between the anode
        and the cathode, thereby further exciting the gaseous mixture. </p>
      <p>As the starter motor continues cranking, piston 39A begins
        moving downward, piston 39B begins moving upward, and the wiper
        arms of the distributors rotate. (Needless to say, a solid-state
        distributor would not rotate. The distributor could utilize
        photo cells, either light or reflected light, rather than
        contact points.) After 45.degree. of rotation, distributor 135
        supplies a gating pulse to electronic switching unit 119,
        thereby completing a circuit through unit 119. The input to unit
        119 is connected to the same lines that supply current to coil
        49A. The completion of the circuit through unit 119, therefore,
        causes coil 51A to be energized in the same manner as coil 49A.
        After an additional 45.degree. of rotation, distributor 135
        gates on electronic switching unit 117 which completes a circuit
        to the same lines. The output terminal of unit 117 is connected
        to coil 53A, and so this coil is energized when unit 117 is
        gated on. All three coils of the "A" cylinder remain energized
        and, therefore, generating magnetic fields in chamber 41A until
        piston 39A reaches BDC. </p>
      <p>As piston 39A moves from TDC to BDC, two additional 40,000 volt
        pulses (for a total of three) are supplied from distributor 99
        to the "A" cylinder. These pulses are spaced approximately
        60.degree. apart. If more pulses are desired, the apparatus
        shown in FIG. 14 may be used. In that case, the solenoids
        indicated generally at 107A, 107B and 109A, 109B are energized
        to create a number of rapid, high-voltage pulses which are
        supplied as indicated in FIG. 14 to the cylinders, distributor
        105 operating to supply pulses to only one of the pair of
        cylinders at a time. </p>
      <p>As piston 39A reaches BDC, distributor 135 sends a pulse to the
        OFF terminals of electronic switching units 121, 117 and 119,
        respectively, causing all three coils 49A, 51A and 53A to be
        deenergized. At about the same time, i.e., between approximately
        5.degree. prior to TDC and TDC for piston 39B, distributor 137
        supplies a gating pulse to the ON terminals of electronic
        switching units 113 and 115. The power inputs to units 113 and
        115 come from the generator through regulator 111 and from the
        battery, and the outputs are directly connected to coils 49A and
        53A. Therefore, when units 113 and 115 are gated on, coils 49A
        and 53A are reenergized. But in this part of the cycle, the
        coils are energized with the opposite polarity, causing a
        reversal in the magnetic field in chamber 41A. Note that coil
        51A is not energized at all during this portion of the cycle.
        Capacitors C1A and C2A are also charged during the BDC to TDC
        portion of the cycle. (During the TDC to BDC portion of the
        cycle, these capacitors are charged and/or discharged by the
        same currents as are supplied to the anode and cathode since
        they are directly connected thereto.) </p>
      <p>As piston 39A moves upward, electrodes 63 and 65 serve as
        pick-up points in order to conduct some of the current out of
        chamber 41A, this current being generated by the excited gases
        in the chamber. Said current is transferred via line L7 to
        electronic switching unit 151. The same gating pulse which gated
        on units 113 and 115 was also supplied from distributor 137 via
        line L12 to gate on switching unit 151, so the current from the
        electrodes of chamber 41A passes through unit 151 to the anode,
        cathode and capacitors of chamber 41B, as well as through
        switching units 147 and 149 to coils 49B, 51B and 53B. Thus it
        can be seen that electricity generated in one cylinder during a
        portion of the cycle is transferred to the other cylinder to
        assist in the excitation of the gaseous mixture in the latter.
        Note that this electricity is regulated to maintain a constant
        in-engine current. It should be noted that twenty four volts
        from the generator is always present on electrodes 63 and 65
        during operation to provide for pre-excitement of the gases. </p>
      <p>From the above it can be seen that distributors 135 and 137 in
        conjunction with electronic switching units 113, 115, 117, 119,
        121, 143, 145, 147, 149 and 151 constitute means for
        individually energizing coils 49A, 49B, 51A, 51B, 53A and 53B.
        More particularly they constitute means operable to energize all
        the coils of a given cylinder from the other cylinder when the
        first cylinder's piston is moving from TDC to BDC and operable
        to energize only two (i.e., less than all) of the coils from the
        alternator when that piston is moving from BDC to TDC.
        Additionally, these components constitute means for energizing
        the coils with a given polarity when the piston of that cylinder
        is moving from TDC to BDC and for energizing the first and third
        coils with the opposite polarity when that piston is moving from
        BDC to TDC. </p>
      <p>As can also be seen, switching units 121 and 151 together with
        distributors 135 and 137 constitute means for closing a circuit
        for flow of current from chamber 41A to chamber 41B during the
        BDC to TDC portion of the cycle of chamber 41A and for closing a
        circuit for flow of current from chamber 41B to chamber 41A
        during the TDC to BDC portion of the cycle of chamber 41A.
        Oscillator 95 constitutes means for supplying a time varying
        electrical voltage to the electrodes of each cylinder, and
        oscillator 95, distributors 135 and 137, and regulators 97A and
        97B together constitute means for supplying the time varying
        voltage during a predetermined portion of the cycle of each
        piston. Moreover, distributor 99 together with ignition coils
        25A and 25B constitute means for supplying high voltage pulses
        to the cylinders at predetermined times during the cycle of each
        piston. </p>
      <p>The cycle of piston 39B is exactly the same as that of piston
        39A except for the 180.degree. phase difference. For each
        cylinder, it is calculated that the excitation as described
        above causes the gases to separate into layers, the lowest
        atomic weight gas in the mixture, namely helium, being disposed
        generally in the center of each chamber, neon forming the next
        layer, and so on until we reach xenon which is in physical
        contact with the chamber walls. The input current (power) to do
        this is the calculated potential of the gas mixture. Since
        helium is located in the center of the chamber, the focal point
        of the electrode discharges and the discharges between the anode
        and cathode is in the helium layer when the piston is near TDC.
        As the piston moves slightly below TDC, the electrons from
        electrodes 63 and 65 will no longer strike the tip of the
        piston, but rather will intersect in the center of the cylinder
        (this is called "focal point electron and particle collision")
        as will the alpha, beta and gamma rays from the anode and
        cathode. Of course, the helium is in this exact spot and is
        heavily ionized at that time. Thus the electrodes together with
        the source of electrical power connected thereto constitute
        means for ionizing the inert gas. It is calculated that as a
        result of all the aforementioned interactions, an ignition
        discharge occurs in which the helium splits into hydrogen in a
        volume not larger than 2 or 3 times 10.sup.-6 cubic millimeters
        at a temperature of approximately 100,000,000.degree. F. Of
        course this temperature is confined to a very small space and
        the layering of the gases insulates the cylinder walls
        therefrom. Such heat excites adjacent helium such that a plasma
        occurs. Consequently, there is a minute fusion reaction in the
        helium consisting of the energy conversion of a single helium
        atom, which releases sufficient energy to drive the piston in
        that chamber toward BDC with a force similar in magnitude to
        that generated in a cylinder of a conventional internal
        combustion engine. Electrodes 63 and 65 extend into the argon
        layer while each piston is in its BDC to TDC stroke so as to
        pick up some of the current flowing in that layer. It may take a
        cycle or two for the gases in the cylinders to become
        sufficiently excited for ignition to occur. </p>
      <p>Once ignition does occur, the electrical operation of the
        engine continues as before, less the operation of the starter
        motor. Distributor 99 supplies three pulses per cycle (or more
        if the magnetic ignition system of FIG. 14 is used) to each
        cylinder; and distributors 135 and 137 continue to supply "on"
        and "off" gating pulses to the electronic switching units. The
        rpm of the engine is, as explained above, governed by the
        frequency of the current from oscillator 95 (or in the case of
        smaller horsepower units, by the dc voltage supplied to the
        cylinders from the aforementioned Variac). </p>
      <p>Because of the minute amount of fuel consumed in each cycle, it
        is calculated that a cylinder can run at 1200 rpm approximately
        1000 hours, if not more, on a single charge of gas. Note that
        even at 1200 rpm, there will be intense heat occurring only
        0.002% of the time. This means that input power need be applied
        only sporadically. And this power can be supplied to a cylinder
        from the other cylinder of its pair by means of electronic
        switching units which, in the case of SCRs, are themselves
        triggered by low voltage (e.g. 3.5 V) current. Thus, since
        electrical power generated in one cylinder is used to excite the
        gases in the other cylinder of a pair, it is practical that the
        cylinders be paired as discussed above. Condensers are, of
        course, used to store such energy for use during the proper
        portion of the cycle of each cylinder. </p>
      <p>From the above, it should be appreciated that the engine of
        this invention has several advantages over presently proposed
        fusion reactors, such as smaller size, lower energy
        requirements, etc. But what are the bases of these advantages?
        For one, presently proposed fusion reactors use hydrogen and its
        isotopes as a fuel instead of inert gases. Presumably this is
        because hydrogen requires less excitement power. While this is
        true, the input power that is required in order to make hydrogen
        reactors operate makes the excitation power almost
        insignificant. For example, to keep a hydrogen reactor from
        short circuiting, the hydrogen gas has to be separated from the
        reactor walls while it is in the plasma state. This separation
        is accomplished by the maintenance of a near vacuum in the
        reactor and by the concentration of the gas in the center of the
        reactor (typically a toroid) by a continuous, intense magnetic
        field. Accordingly, separation requires a large amount of input
        energy. </p>
      <p>In the present invention, on the other hand, the greater
        excitation energy of the fuel is more than compensated for by
        the fact that the input energy for operation can be minimized by
        manipulation of the unique characteristics of the inert gases.
        First, helium is the inert gas used for fusion in the present
        invention. The helium is primarily isolated from the walls of
        the container by the layering of the other inert gases, which
        layering is caused by the different excitation potential
        (because of the different atomic weights) of the different inert
        gases, said excitation being caused by the action of the
        electrodes, anode and cathode in a magnetic field. This
        excitation causes the gases each to be excited in inverse
        proportion to their atomic numbers, the lighter gases being
        excited correspondingly more. Helium, therefore, forms the
        central core with the other four gases forming layers, in order,
        around the helium. The helium is secondarily isolated from the
        walls of the container by a modest vacuum (in comparison to the
        vacuum in hydrogen reactors) which is caused partially by the
        "choking" effect of the coils and partially by the enlargement
        of the combustion chamber as the piston moves from TDC to BDC.
        (Unexcited, the gases are at one atmosphere at TDC.) Second,
        argon, the middle gas of the five, is a good electrical
        conductor and becomes an excellent conductor when (as explained
        infra) it is polarized during the mixing process. By placing the
        electrodes such that they are in the argon layer, electrical
        energy can be tapped from one cylinder for use in the other.
        During a piston's movement from BDC to TDC, the gases are caused
        to circulate in the cylinder by the change in the polarity of
        the coils, which occurs at BDC. During such circulation, the
        gases remain layered, causing the argon atoms to be relatively
        close to each other, thereby optimizing the conductivity of the
        argon. This conductivity optimization is further enhanced by a
        mild choking effect that is due to the magnetic fields. The
        circulation of the highly conductive argon results in a
        continuous cutting of the magnetic lines of force so that the
        current flows through the electrodes. This production of
        electricity is similar to the rotating copper wire cutting the
        magnetic lines of force in a conventional generator except that
        the rotating copper wire is replaced by the rotating, highly
        conductive argon. The amount of electricity that can be produced
        in this manner is a function of how many magnetic field lines
        are available to be cut. If one of the coils, or all three of
        the coils or two adjacent coils were energized, there would be
        only one field with electricity produced at each end. By
        energizing the top and the bottom coil, two separate fields are
        produced, with electricity produced at four points. A five coil
        system, if there were sufficient space, would produce three
        fields with the top, bottom and middle coils energized. Six
        points for electricity production would result. The number of
        coils that can be installed on a given cylinder is a function of
        space limitations. The recombination of gas atoms during the BDC
        to TDC phase causes the radiation of electrical energy which
        also provides a minor portion of the electricity that the
        electrode picks up. Additional non-grounded electrodes in each
        cylinder would result in more electricity being tapped off. It
        should be noted that during the BDC to TDC phase, the anode and
        the cathode are also in the argon layer and, like the
        electrodes, they pick up electricity, which charges the
        capacitors around the cylinder. Third, inert gases remain a
        mixture and do not combine because of the completeness of the
        electron shells. They are therefore well suited to a cycle
        whereby they are continually organized and reorganized. Fourth,
        as the helium atoms are consumed, the other gases have the
        capacity to absorb the charge of the consumed gas so that the
        total charge of the mixture remains the same. </p>
      <p>The second basis of these advantages of the present engine over
        proposed fusion reactors concerns the fact that hydrogen
        reactors develop heat which generates steam to turn turbines in
        order to generate electrical power. This requires tremendous
        input energy on a continuous basis. The present invention
        operates on a closed cycle, utilizing pistons and a crankshaft
        which does not require a continuous plasma but rather an
        infrequent, short duration (10.sup.-6 second) plasma that
        therefore requires much less input energy. In the present
        invention, a plasma lasting longer than 10.sup.-6 second is not
        necessary because sufficient pressure is generated in that time
        to turn the engine. A plasma of longer duration could damage the
        engine if the heat were sufficiently intense to be transmitted
        through the inert gas layers to the cylinder walls. A similar
        heat buildup in the engine can occur if the repetition rate is
        increased. Such an increase can be used to increase the
        horsepower per engine size but at the cost of adding a cooling
        system, using more expensive engine components, and increasing
        fuel consumption. Note that even though layers of inert gases
        insulate the cylinder walls, there might be some slight increase
        in the temperature of the gas layers after a number of cycles,
        i.e., after a number of ignitions. </p>
      <p>Whereas hydrogen fusion reactors cannot directly produce power
        by driving a piston (because of the required vacuum), the
        present invention uses the layered inert gases to transmit the
        power from the plasma to each gas in turn until the power is
        applied to a piston, which can easily be translated into rotary
        motion. The layered gases also cushion the piston from the full
        force of the ignition. Moreover, the fields inside the cylinder
        undergoing expansion cause the gases to shrink, thereby taking
        up some of the pressure generated by the explosion and
        preventing rupturing of the cylinder walls. </p>
      <p>Turning now to FIGS. 17A-17D, there is shown apparatus 201 for
        preparing the fuel mixture for engine 11. For convenience
        apparatus 201 is called a mixer although it should be understood
        that the apparatus not only mixes the gases which form the fuel
        but also performs many other vital functions as well. The five
        constituent inert gases are introduced in precise, predetermined
        proportions. The mixer extracts, filters and neutralizes the
        non-inert gases and other contaminants which may be found in the
        gas mixture. It also increases the potential capacity of gas
        atoms, discharges the krypton and xenon gases, polarizes the
        argon gases, ionizes the gases in a manner such that the
        ionization is maintained until the gas has been utilized and
        otherwise prepares them for use as a fuel in engine 11. In
        particular, the mixer makes the gases easier to excite during
        operation of the engine. Mixing does not mean an atomic or
        molecular combination or unification of gases because inert
        gases cannot chemically combine, in general, due to the
        completeness of the outer shell of electrons. During mixing, the
        various gases form a homogeneous mixture. The mixing of the five
        inert gases in apparatus 201 is somewhat analogous to preparing
        a five part liquid chemical mixture by titration. In such a
        mixture, the proportions of the different chemicals are
        accurately determined by visually observing the end point of
        each reaction during titration. In apparatus 201, a visible,
        spectroscopic flash of light accompanies the desired end point
        of the introduction of each new gas as it reaches its proper,
        precalculated proportion. (Each gas has its own distinctive,
        characteristic, spectroscopic display.) The ends points are
        theoretically calculated and are determined by pre-set voltages
        on each of a group of ionizing heads, described infra, in the
        apparatus. </p>
      <p>Mixer 201 includes (see FIG. 17A) an intake port, indicated
        generally at 203, which during operation is connected to a
        source 205 of helium gas, a gauge 206, glass tubing 207
        comprising a plurality of branches B10-B25 for flow of the gases
        through the mixer, a plurality of valves V1-V11 in the branches,
        which valves may be opened or closed as necessary, three gas
        reservoirs 209, 211 and 213 for storing small quantities of
        helium, argon and neon gas respectively, an ionizing and
        filtering unit 215 for filtering undesired non-inert gases and
        contaminants out of the fuel mixture, for regulating the gas
        atom electron charge and to absorb the free flowing electrons, a
        gas flow circulation pump 217, two ionizing heads 219 and 221,
        and three quality control and exhaust valves V12-V14. The mixer
        also comprises (see FIG. 17B) a high frequency discharge tube
        225, a non-directed cathode ray tube 227, two more ionizing
        heads 229 and 231, two additional gas reservoirs 233 and 235 for
        storing small quantities of xenon and krypton, a quadruple
        magnetic coil 237, a plurality of valves V15-V24, valves V23 and
        V24 being quality control and exhaust valves, and a plurality of
        additional glass tubing branches B26-B32. </p>
      <p>Turning to FIG. 17C, mixer 201 also includes additional
        ionizing heads 239, 240 and 241, additional valves V25-V46, V39A
        and V40A, valves V29 and V32 being quality control and exhaust
        valves and valve V39A being a check valve, a vacuum and pressure
        gauge 242 between valves V35 and V36, tubing branches B34-B49
        (branch B39 consisting of two parts B39A and B39B), a pair of
        intake ports 243 and 245 which during operation are connected to
        sources 247 and 249 of argon and neon gas respectively, gauges
        250A and 250B, a spark chamber 251, a hydrogen and oxygen
        retention chamber 253 containing No. 650 steel dust in a silk
        filter, an ion gauge 255 (which can be an RG 75K type Ion Gauge
        from Glass Instruments, Inc. of Pasadena, Calif.) for removing
        excess inert gases from the mixture, inner and outer coils of
        glass tubing 257 and 259 surrounding a mixing chamber 261, a
        focused x-ray tube 263 for subjecting the mixture flowing
        therethrough to 15-20 millirem alpha radiation and 120-125
        millirem beta radiation, a directed cathode ray tube 265, two
        twin parallel magnetic coils 266 and 267, and a focusing
        magnetic coil 269. It is important that coils 266 and 267 be
        immediately adjacent mixing chamber 261. And (see FIG. 17D) the
        mixer also comprises three more ionizing heads 271, 273 and 275,
        two entry ports 277 and 279 which during operation are connected
        to sources 281 and 283 of krypton and xenon respectively, gauges
        284A and 284B, a high frequency discharge tube 285, a twin
        parallel magnetic coil 287 surrounding a polarizer 289 for
        polarizing the argon, said polarizer containing fine steel
        particles which are polarized by coils 287 and which in turn
        polarize argon, a second hydrogen retention chamber 291, a pair
        of tubing branches B50 and B51, two filters 293 and 295 and a
        plurality of valves V47-V59, valves V57 and V59 being quality
        control and exhaust valves. </p>
      <p>Inner and outer glass tubing coils 257 and 259 and mixing
        chamber 261 are shown in cross section in FIG. 18. Intermediate
        glass coils 257 and 259 are two magnetic coils 297 and 299
        having an inductance of approximately 130 mH. A yoke coil 301 is
        semicircularly disposed around mixing chamber 261. Inside mixing
        chamber 261 are located a pair of screens 303 and 305,
        insulators 307 and 309, and a pair of spark gaps indicated
        generally at 311 and 313. A high frequency amplitude modulated
        source provides 120 V ac., 60 Hz, 8.4 amp, 560 watt, 27,120 to
        40,000 MHz.+-.160 KHz current via heavily insulated wires 315
        and 317 to the chamber. These wires are about twelve gauge, like
        those used as spark plug wires on internal combustion engines.
        Additionally 95 V direct current is supplied thereto via a
        smaller (e.g. sixteen to eighteen gauge) insulated wire 319. As
        described below, the gases to be mixed and prepared flow through
        chamber 261 and are suitably treated therein by the action of
        the various fields present in the chamber. </p>
      <p>The magnetic coils, ionization heads, and pump 217, along with
        the required electrical interconnections, are schematically
        shown in FIGS. 19A-19E. More particularly, heads 239 and 241 are
        shown in FIG. 19A, as is pump 217. Each ionizing head has two
        electrodes with a gap therebetween to cause ionization of gases
        flowing through said head, the electrodes being connected to a
        source of electrical power. Pump 217 is directly connected to a
        source of power (either a.c. or d.c. as required by the
        particular pump being used). The connections between the
        circuitry on FIG. 19A and that on FIG. 19B are shown as a plug
        321, it being understood that this plug represents a suitable
        one-to-one connection between the lines of FIG. 19A and those of
        FIG. 19B. </p>
      <p>The remaining ionizing heads and all the magnetic coils are
        shown in FIG. 19B. For clarity, the coils are shown in an
        unconventional form. Quadruple coil 237 (shown at the top of
        FIG. 19B) has one side of each winding connected in common but
        the other sides are connected to different lines. Coil 223
        consists of two windings in parallel. Coils 297 and 299, the
        ones around the mixing chamber, are shown overlapping, it being
        understood that coil 297 is actually interior of coil 299. Yoke
        coil 301, as shown, extends half-way from the bottom to the top
        of coils 297 and 299. Twin parallel magnetic coils 267 are
        connected in parallel with each other, both sides of focusing
        coil 269 being connected to one node of coils 267. Likewise
        coils 287 are connected in parallel. The connections between the
        lines of FIGS. 19B and those of FIGS. 19C and 19D are shown as
        plugs 323 and 325, although other suitable one-to-one
        connections could certainly be made. FIG. 19C shows the
        interconnecting lines between FIGS. 19B and 19E. A plug 327 or
        other suitable one-to-one connections connects the lines of
        FIGS. 19C and 19E. </p>
      <p>A plurality of power sources, like the above-mentioned Variacs,
        of suitable voltages and currents as well as a plurality of
        relays 329, and plugs 331 are shown on FIGS. 19D and 19E. The
        connections between these two Figs. is shown as a plug 333. It
        should be appreciated that the Variacs can be adjusted by the
        operator as necessary to supply the desired voltages to the
        aforementioned coils and ionizing heads. It should also be
        realized that the desired relays can be closed or opened as
        needed by connecting or disconnecting the two parts of the
        corresponding plug 331. That is, by use of plugs 331, the
        operator can control the energizing of the ionizing heads and
        magnetic coils as desired. Plugs 331 are also an aid in checking
        to ensure that each component is in operating condition just
        prior to its use. Of course, the manipulation of the power
        sources and the relays need not be performed manually; it could
        be automated. </p>
      <p>The remaining circuitry for the mixer is shown on FIGS.
        20A-20F. For convenience, plugs 335, 337, 339, 341, 343, 345 and
        347 are shown as connecting the circuitry shown in the various
        Figs., although other suitable one-to-one connections may be
        used. The chassis of the apparatus is shown on these Figs. in
        phantom and is grounded. The power supply for the apparatus is
        shown in part on FIGS. 20A and 20D and includes an input 349
        (see FIG. 20D) which is connected to 120 V, 60 Hz power during
        operation and an input 351 which is connected to the
        aforementioned high frequency generator or some other suitable
        source of approximately 27,120 MHz current. The power supply
        includes a pair of tuners 353, numerous RLC circuits, a triode
        355, a pentode 357 with a ZnS screen, a variable transformer
        359, an input control 361, a second variable transformer 363
        (see FIG. 20A) which together with a filter 365 forms a 2.0
        volts (peak-to-peak) power supply 367, a pentode 369, a variable
        transformer 371, and a resistor network indicated generally at
        373. Exemplary voltages in the power supply during operation are
        as follows: The anode of triode 355 is at 145 V, the control
        grid at 135 V and the cathode at -25 V. The voltage at the top
        of the right-hand winding of transformer 359 is -5 V. The anode
        of pentode 357 is at 143 V, the top grid is grounded (as is the
        ZnS screen), the bottom grid is connected to transformer 359,
        and the control electrode is at 143 V. The input to supply 367
        is 143 volts ac while its output, as stated above, is 2 V
        (peak-to-peak). The anode of pentode 369 is at 60 V, the grids
        at -1.5 V, the control electrode at 130 V, and the cathode is
        substantially at ground. And the output of resistor network 373,
        labelled 375, is at 45 V. </p>
      <p>Also shown on FIG. 20D is spark chamber 251. Spark chamber 251
        includes a small amount of thorium, indicated at 377, and a
        plurality of parallel brass plates 379. When the gases in the
        mixer reach the proper ionization, the alpha particles emitted
        by the thorium shown up as flashes of light in the spark
        chamber. </p>
      <p>Turning now to FIG. 20B, ionizing and filtering unit 215
        includes a pair of conductive supports 381 for a plurality of
        conductors 383, said supports and conductors being connected to
        a voltage source, an insulative support 385 for additional
        conductors 387, and a ZnS screen 388 which emits light when
        impurities are removed from the gaseous fuel mixture. Unit 215
        also includes a second set of interleaved conductors indicated
        generally at 389, a cold-cathode tube 391, and an x-ray tube
        indicated generally at 393. Also shown on FIG. 20B is an RLC
        network 395 which has an output on a line 397 which is at 35 V,
        this voltage being supplied to the x-ray tube. </p>
      <p>High frequency discharge tube 255 (see FIG. 20C) has a
        conductive electrode 399 at one end to which high frequency
        current is applied to excite the gases in the mixer, and an
        electrode/heater arrangement 401 at the other, a voltage of 45 V
        being applied to an input 402 of said tube. It is desirable that
        a small quantity of mercury, indicated at 403, be included in
        tube 225 to promote discharge of the helium gas. Magnetic coils
        237 have disposed therein a pair of generally parallel
        conductors 405 to which a high frequency signal is applied. When
        gas flows through coils 237 and between parallel conductors 405,
        therefore, it is subjected to the combination of a DC magnetic
        field from the coil and high frequency waves from the
        conductors, which conductors act as transmitting antennas. The
        resulting high frequency magnetic field causes the atoms to
        become unstable, which allows the engine to change a given
        atom's quantum level with much less input power than would
        normally be required. The volume of each gas atom will also be
        smaller. Also shown on FIG. 20C is non-directed cathode ray tube
        227. The grids of tube 227 are at 145 V, the control electrode
        is at ground, while the anode is at 35 V to 80 V (peak-to-peak).
        The purpose of non-directed cathode ray tube 227 is to add
        photons to the gas mixture. To generate these photons, tube 227
        has a two layer ZnS coating indicated generally at 407. Chamber
        261, described above, is also shown schematically on FIG. 20C,
        along with an RLC network 409. </p>
      <p>The power supply for the mixer (see the lower halves of FIGS.
        20E and 20F) also includes two pentodes 411 and 413, a
        transformer 415, and a diode tube 417. The control electrode of
        pentode 411 is at 5 V to 40 V (peak-to-peak), the grids are at
        145 V, the anode is at 100 V, and the cathode is at 8 V to 30 V
        (peak-to-peak). The control electrode of pentode 413 is at 115
        V, while its grids and cathode are at -33 V. The anode of tube
        413 is connected to transformer 415. Also shown on FIG. 20E are
        a relay 419 associated with ion gauge 255, and focused x-ray
        tube 263 associated with ionization head 240. The upper input to
        tube 263 is at 45 V to 80 V (peak-to-peak). </p>
      <p>Turning to FIG. 20F, there is shown tubes 265 and 285. Directed
        cathode ray tube 265 is a pentode connected like tube 227. High
        frequency discharge tube 285 includes a phosphor screen and is
        connected to a high frequency source. Also shown on FIG. 20F is
        a triode 421 with its anode at 30 V, its cathode at ground, and
        its control grid at -60 V; a pentode 423 with its anode at 135 V
        to 1000 V peak to peak, its cathode at ground, its control
        electrode at 143 V, its grids at 20 V; and a transformer 425. It
        should be understood that various arrangements of electrical
        components other than those described above could be designed to
        perform the same functions. </p>
      <p>The operation of the mixer is best understood with reference to
        FIGS. 17A-17D and is as follows: Before and during operation,
        the mixer, and particularly chamber 261 is kept hermetically
        sealed and evacuated. To begin the mixing process, helium is
        admitted into the mixer via intake port 203. Then a vacuum is
        again drawn, by a vacuum pump (not shown) connected to valve
        V38, to flush the chamber. This flushing is repeated several
        times to completely cleanse the tubing branches of the mixer.
        The mixer is now ready. The ionization heads next to mixing
        chamber 261 are connected to a voltage corresponding to
        approximately 36% of the calculated total ionizing voltage, dc
        current is allowed to flow through magnetic coils 297 and 299
        around chamber 261, and high frequency current is allowed to
        pass through the mixing chamber. Helium is then slowly admitted,
        via port 203, into the mixer. From port 203, the helium passes
        through ionization head 219 into glass tubing coil 259. This
        glass coil, being outside magnetic coils 297 and 299, is in the
        diverging portion of a magnetic field. The helium slowly flowing
        through glass coil 259 is gently excited. From coil 259, the
        helium flows through branch B45 to ionization head 275 and from
        there, via branch B28, to ionization head 229 (see FIG. 17B).
        From head 229, the gas flows through non-directed cathode ray
        tube 227 to high-frequency discharger 225. The high frequency
        discharger 225, with heating element, discharges, separates or
        completely neutralizes the charge of any radioactive and/or
        cosmic particles that are in the helium atom in addition to the
        protons, neutrons and electrons. The gas exits discharger 225
        via branch B26 and passes to high-frequency discharger 285. The
        high frequency discharger 285, without heating element, disturbs
        the frequency of oscillation which binds the gas atoms together.
        This prepares the helium atoms so that the electrons can more
        easily be split from the nucleus during the excitation and
        ignition process in the engine. Discharger 285 includes a
        phosphorus screen or deposit (similar to the coating on a
        cathode ray tube) which makes discharges in the tube visible.
        From discharger 285, the helium passes through directed cathode
        ray tube 265 and focused x-ray tube 263. Directed cathode ray
        tube 265 produces cathode rays which oscillate back and forth
        longitudinally underneath and along the gas carrying tube.
        Thereafter the helium passes successively through branch B21,
        ionization head 221, branch B23, twin parallel magnetic coil
        266, and branch B25 into mixing chamber 261. Helium flows slowly
        into and through apparatus 201. The helium atoms become ionized
        as a result of excitation by magnetic force, high frequency
        vibrations and charge acquired from the ionization heads. When
        sufficient helium has entered the apparatus, the ionization
        energy (which is approximately 36% of the total) is totally
        absorbed. A spectroscopic flash of light in the mixing chamber
        signals that the precise, proper quantity of helium has been
        allowed to enter. The entry of helium is then immediately halted
        by the closing of valve V3. </p>
      <p>The next step in preparing the fuel is to add neon to the
        mixture. The potential on the relevant ionization heads,
        particularly head 241 (see FIG. 17C), is raised by the addition
        of approximately 26% which results in a total of approximately
        62% of the total calculated potential and valve V31 is opened,
        thereby allowing neon to slowly enter the mixer via port 245.
        This gas passes through branch B36, ionization head 241, and
        branch B35 directly into the mixing chamber. Since the
        previously admitted helium is fully charged, the neon absorbs
        all of the increased ionization potential. As soon as the neon
        acquires the additional charge, a spectroscopic flash of light
        occurs and the operator closes valve V31. </p>
      <p>In the same manner, the potential on the ionization heads is
        increased by the addition of approximately 17% for a total of
        approximately 79% of the total calculated potential and then
        valve V30 is opened to admit argon into the mixer via port 243.
        This gas passes through branch B34, ionization head 239, and
        branch B33 into mixing chamber 261. Again, when the proper
        amount of argon has been admitted, it emits a spectroscopic
        flash of light and the operator closes valve V30. Next, the
        potential on the ionization heads is increased by the addition
        of approximately 13% to result in a total of approximately 92%
        of the total calculated potential and valve V58 (see FIG. 17D)
        is opened to admit krypton into the system. The krypton gas
        passes through branch B51, ionization head 271 and branch B48
        into chamber 261. Upon the emission of a spectroscopic flash of
        light by the gas, the operator closes valve V58. Finally, the
        potential on the ionization heads is increased by the addition
        of approximately 8% which brings the ionization potential to the
        full 100% of the calculated ionization voltage and valve V56 is
        opened to admit xenon into the mixer via port 279. This gas
        passes through branch B50, ionization head 273 and branch B47 to
        the mixing chamber. When the proper amount of gas has been
        admitted, a spectroscopic flash of light occurs signalling the
        operator to close valve V56. Note that there are two
        filter/absorber units, labelled 253 and 291. Unit 253 is
        connected to the neon and argon inlet branches B33 and B35 while
        unit 291 is connected to the krypton and xenon inlet branches
        B47 and B48. These two units absorb hydrogen residue and
        immobilize the water vapor created when the pump circulates the
        gases and generates vacuum states. </p>
      <p>After all the gases are admitted in the desired proportions,
        all the valves are closed. (The mixture in the mixing chamber
        and in the adjacent tubing is at one atmosphere pressure at this
        time.) Once this is done, the interval valves of the system are
        all opened (but the inlet and outlet valves remain closed) to
        allow the mixture to circulate throughout the tubing as follows:
        branch B44, magnetic coils 267 and 269, ionization head 240,
        branch B29, ionization head 231, branch B24, ionization head
        219, pump 217, branches B15 and B39A, ionization gauge 255,
        branches B38 and B42, ionization head 275, branch B28,
        ionization head 229, non-directed cathode ray tube 227,
        quadruple magnetic coil 272, ionization head 221, branch B23,
        twin parallel magnetic coil 266, branch B25 and mixing chamber
        261. When this circuit is initially opened, the pressure of the
        mixture drops 40-50% because some of the tubing had previously
        been under vacuum. Pump 217 is then started to cause the gases
        to be slowly and evenly mixed. </p>
      <p>Because of dead space in the tubing and the reaction time of
        the operator, it may occur that the proportions of the gases are
        not exactly those set forth above. This is remedied during the
        circulation step. As the gas flows through ionization gauge 255,
        excess gas is removed from the mixture so that the correct
        proportions are obtained. To do this the grid of gauge 255 is
        subjected to 100% ionization energy and is heated to
        approximately 165.degree. F. This temperature, 165.degree. F. is
        related to xenon's boiling point of -165.degree. F. in magnitude
        but is opposite in sign. Xenon is the heaviest of the five inert
        gases in the mixture. As the gas mixture flows through
        ionization gauge 255, the gas atoms that are in excess of their
        prescribed percentages are burned out of the mixture and their
        charge is acquired by the remaining gas atoms from the grid of
        the ionization gauge. Because the gases are under a partial
        vacuum, the ionization gauge is able to adjust the gas
        percentages very precisely. (Note: The steps described in the
        last two paragraphs are repeated if the finished gases are
        rejected in the final quality control step described infra.) </p>
      <p>The next step involves purifying the mixture so that only the
        five inert gases remain, absorbing any free electrons and
        regulating the electrical charge in the mixture. To do this, the
        circuit consisting of the following components is opened: Branch
        B44, magnetic coil 267, magnetic coil 269, ionization head 240,
        branch B29, ionization head 231, branch B24, ionization head
        219, pump 217, branches B15 and B39, magnetic coil 287 (see FIG.
        17D) polarizer 289, branch B17, ionizing and filtering unit 215,
        branches B16, B42, and B41, x-ray tube 263, branch B21,
        ionization head 221, branch B23, magnetic coil 266, branch B25,
        and mixing chamber 261. The gases should complete this circuit
        at least three times. </p>
      <p>The last step required to prepare the mixture for bottling is
        polarization of the argon. The circuit required to do this
        consists of the following components: mixing chamber 261, branch
        B44, magnetic coil 267, magnetic coil 269, ionization head 240,
        cathode ray tube 265, branch B40, tubing coil 257, branches B49
        and B30, ionization head 231, branch B24, ionization head 219,
        pump 217, branches B15 and B39, twin parallel magnetic coil 287
        (see FIG. 17D), polarizer 289, branch B17, ionizing and
        filtering unit 215, branches B16, B42 and B20, ionization head
        229, cathode ray tube 227, magnetic coil 237, ionization head
        221, branch B23 and magnetic coil 266. This too is repeated at
        least three times. The key to the polarization of argon is
        polarizer 289 and twin parallel magnetic coil 287 that encircles
        it. Polarizer 289 is a glass bottle which is filled with finely
        powdered soft iron which can be easily magnetized. The filled
        bottle is, in effect, the iron core of the coils. The iron
        particles align themselves with the magnetic lines of force,
        which lines radiate from the center toward the north and south
        poles. The ionized gas mixture is forced through the magnetized
        iron powder by means of pump pressure and vacuum, thereby
        polarizing the argon gas. Filters 293 and 295 are disposed as
        shown in order to filter metallic particles out of the gas. </p>
      <p>The mixture is now double-checked by means of spark chamber 251
        at atmospheric pressure since the fusion reaction in the engine
        is started at one atmosphere. Because the gases in mixing
        apparatus 201 are at a partial vacuum, sufficient gases must be
        pumped into spark chamber 251 to attain atmospheric pressure. To
        do this valves V33, V36 and V40A are closed and circulating pump
        217 pumps the gases in the mixing apparatus via branches B15 and
        B39A, through check valve V39A into spark chamber 251 until the
        vacuum and pressure gauge 242 indicates that the gases within
        spark chamber 251 are at atmospheric pressure. Valve V34 is then
        closed. The spark chamber is similar to a cloud chamber. Six or
        more high capacity brass capacitor plates are spaced 1/8" to
        1/4" apart in the chamber. A small plastic container holds the
        thorium 232. One side of the chamber is equipped with a thick
        glass window through which sparks in the chamber may be
        observed. A potential is placed on the brass plates in the
        chamber and the current flowing between the plates is measured.
        If this current exactly corresponds to the ionization current,
        the mixture is acceptable. A difference of greater than 5% is
        not acceptable. A lesser difference can be corrected by
        recirculating the gas in the mixer and particularly through
        ionization gauge 255 as previously described in the circulation
        step. A second test is then given the gases that pass the first
        test. A calculated high frequency current is gradually imposed
        on the spark chamber capacitor plates. This excitation causes
        neutrons to be emitted from the thorium 232 which, if the
        mixture is satisfactory, can be easily seen as a thin thread of
        light in the chamber. If the mixture is not satisfactory, light
        discharges cannot be seen and the high frequency circuit will
        short out and turn off before the desired frequency is reached.
      </p>
      <p>To bottle the mixture, valve V33 is opened and valves V36 and
        V40 are closed. During bottling polarizer 289, twin parallel
        magnetic coil 287, ionization unit 215 and ion gauge 255 are
        electrically energized (all electrical circuits are previously
        deenergized) to improve the stability of the mixture. The
        prepared gases are withdrawn from the mixing apparatus via
        branches B24 and B16, ionization unit 215, branch B17, filters
        293 and 295, polarizer 289, twin parallel magnetic coil 287,
        branch B39, ion gauge 255, check valve V39A, branch B38 and
        spark chamber 251. If desired, after bottling the mixer may be
        exhausted by opening valves V12, V13, V14, V23, V24, V29, V32,
        V57 and V59. Of course, one can also automate the fuel
        preparation process to be continuous so that it would never be
        necessary to exhaust the gas. </p>
      <p>In operation of mixing apparatus 201, certain operational
        factors must be considered. For one, no electrical devices can
        be on without the pump being in operation because an electrical
        device that is on can damage adjacent gas that is not
        circulating. For another, it should be noted that directed
        cathode ray tube 265, non-directed cathode ray tube 227 and
        focused x-ray tube 263 serve different functions at different
        points in the mixing process. In one mode, they provide hot
        cathode radiation, which can occur only in a vacuum. When gases
        are flowing through these devices, they provide a cold cathode
        discharge. For example, during argon polarization and the
        circulation step, focused x-ray tube 263 is under vacuum and
        affects the gases flowing through ionization head 240 by way of
        hot cathode radiation. During the introduction of the different
        gases into mixing apparatus 201 and during the recirculation
        step, the gases are flowing through focused x-ray tube 263,
        which affects the gases by way of a cold cathode discharge. </p>
      <p>It is preferred that each switchable electrical component in
        mixing apparatus 201 be wired into a separate circuit despite
        the fact that one of the poles of each could be commonly wired.
        In a common ground circuit if one device is turned on, all of
        the other units may also turn on because the gases in the device
        are conductive. In addition, if one unit on a common circuit
        were energized with high frequency current, the others would
        also be affected. In the same vein, the high frequency current
        cannot be used when the cathode ray tubes, the x-ray tubes or
        the dischargers are heated and under vacuum because the heater
        filaments will burn out. </p>
      <p>Finally, the current source, the variable rectifiers and the
        electrical measuring instruments must be located more than ten
        feet from mixing apparatus 201 because the high frequency
        current is harmful to the rectifiers, causing them to burn out
        or short out. </p>
      <p>It is hoped that a brief summary of the concepts used by the
        inventor in developing the above invention will be helpful to
        the reader, it being understood that this summary is in no way
        intended to limit the claims which follow or to affect their
        validity. The first concept is that of using an inert gas
        mixture at approximately one atmosphere at TDC (at ignition) as
        a fuel in a thermonuclear energy production process. The second
        concept is the layering of the various inert gases, which
        layering is designed to confine the input energy in the
        innermost layers during pre-excitement and ignition, to provide
        thermal insulation for the container walls during and after
        ignition, to transmit power resulting from the ignition through
        the layers in turn to the piston, to absorb the pressure
        generated during ignition to protect the cylinder walls, and to
        provide an orderly, predictable positioning of the argon layer
        during the BDC to TDC portion of the engine cycle. The third
        concept of this invention involves utilizing electric current
        produced in one cylinder of a pair to perform functions in the
        other cylinder of that pair. This concept includes the
        sub-concepts of generating electric current by atomic
        recombination and of electric generation in place resulting from
        the rotation of layered inert gases within each cylinder because
        of the changed polarity of the encircling coils at BDC, from
        judicious placement of coils which produce magnetic field lines
        which are cut by a near perfect conductor (polarized argon), and
        from movement of said near perfect conductor through the
        magnetic field. </p>
      <p>The fourth and fifth concepts of this invention are the
        transformation of rapid, intense, but short duration
        thermonuclear reactions into pressure that is transmitted from
        inert gas to inert gas until it creates linear kinetic energy at
        the piston, which energy is converted into rotary kinetic energy
        by a crankshaft, and the use of a shaft-driven generator to
        provide power to spaced field coils during the BDC to TDC
        portion of the cycle of each cylinder. </p>
      <p>The sixth concept concerns adequate pre-excitement of the inert
        gas fuel and more particularly involves the sub-concepts of
        pre-exciting the fuel in the mixing process, of manipulation of
        the currents in the coils surrounding each cylinder, of
        discharging the capacitors surrounding each cylinder at
        predetermined times in the cycles, of causing a stream of
        electrical particles to flow between electrodes and a conductive
        discharge point on the piston, of emitting alpha, beta and gamma
        rays from an anode and a cathode containing low level
        radioactive material to the piston's discharge point, of
        accelerating the alpha, beta and gamma rays by the application
        of a high voltage field, and of situating capacitor plates 90
        degrees from the anode and cathode to slow and reflect neutrons
        generated during ignition. The seventh concept involves the
        provision of a minute, pellet-type fission ignition, the heat
        from which causes a minute fusion as the result of the ignition
        chamber shape and arrangement, as a result of the collision of
        the alpha, beta and gamma rays and the electrical particles at a
        focal point in conjunction with the discharge of the capacitors
        that surround the cylinder through the electrodes, and as a
        result of increasing the magnetic field in the direction of the
        movement of each piston. </p>
      <p>In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects
        of the invention are achieved and other advantageous results
        attained. </p>
      <p>As various changes could be made in the above methods,
        constructions and products without departing from the scope of
        the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the
        above description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be
        interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </p>
