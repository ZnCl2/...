      <p><b>3.25. EXPERIMENTS OF TSZYAN KANCHGEN</b> </p>
      <p>Tszyan Kanchgen has lead a series of experiments, which have
        shown an opportunity of direct transfer of the information from
        one biological object to another by radio waves [45]. Tszyan
        Kanchgen has created installation [46], including hollow correct
        of polyhedron and hollow cones located on its sides. The
        biological object which is carrying out influence is located in
        a cavity of polyhedron, its the radiations amplify and are
        transferred to other alive object by microwaves. </p>
      <p>In experiments with cereal cultures Tszyan Kanchgen placed in
        the installation green weight of wheat and influenced by radio
        waves on germinate sabadillas of corn. The "processed" corn had
        set of lateral stalks. On the place of panicle the original ears
        with grains similar and on corn, and on wheaten (fig. 26) were
        formed. The acquired new qualities were steadily transferred to
        the subsequent generations. </p>
      <p>Fig. 26. Results of experiments of Tszyan Kanchgen [45]. </p>
      <p>Using a similar technique Tszyan Kanchgen carried out
        experiences above animals. He placed in installation a duck and
        irradiated 500 chicken eggs. 480 chickens were hatched, at which
        on the clutches have appeared the membranes (fig. 26?), have
        changed arrangement of the eyes and there was flat duck&nbsp;
        form of the head [45]. </p>
      <p>Tszyan Kanchgen considers, that at influence of young organisms
        on old it is possible to rehabilitate the DNA of last and thus
        to rejuvenate them. The experiences on old mice were carried
        out. Them influenced by radiation of young sprouts of plants and
        germs of animals. In result at mice the reactions, mobility,
        appetite were improved. At some the sexual functions and ability
        to duplication were restored. At the most part of experimental
        group the life expectancy has grown for 1,5 years in comparison
        with control [45].<br>

      ...The fifth type of torsion generator employs a combination of
      the principles described above. For instance, a combination of
      high-frequency electromagnetic oscillations and topological effect
      (shape effect) is used in the generators developed by Yu.V.Tszyan
      Kanchzhen. (The operation of his devices was interpreted as
      "high-frequency bio-communication".) Fig.5 shows the diagram of
      Tszyan Kanchzhen's torsion generator. The object 6 (e.g. a hen) is
      placed into the receiver-enclosure 5. Another object 4 (e.g. a
      duck) is placed into the transmitter-enclosure. The
      transmitter-enclosure is a three-dimensional shape consisting of
      pentagon 1. Cones 2 are placed on the sides of these pentagons.
      The object 4 is subjected to the influence of a generator of
      high-frequency (~ 11 GHz) electromagnetic oscillations 3. The
      torsion component of these EM ocsillations excites the torsion
      field of object 4. This torsion field is also intensified by the
      topological effect of 1,2. The excited torsion field is
      concentrated at the tops of the cones 2 and then is directed to
      the receiver-enclosure 5. As a rule, a several-day stay of objects
      4 and 6 in them resulted in following. If a hen is placed in the
      receiver-enclosure and a duck is placed in the
      transmitter-enclosure, then a hen gradually starts to look like a
      duck. (For instance, a hen gained duck webs and etc.)<br>

      I waited Jiang Kanchzhena in the lobby, where he stayed span from
      Khabarovsk to Simferopol. Recognized him at once. Not only because
      of the specific appearance. But also because in the 15 years that
      we have not seen Kanchzhen almost unchanged. Well, older, of
      course. Five years at the most. Son identified: "Dad, look you in
      the same age." And, perhaps, made me compliment our guest thinner
      portly me, and gray hair on his head is smaller. And he was
      exactly 20 years of age or older. That's what a regular
      rejuvenation!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Kozlokrol and pshekuruza</b><br>
      <br>
      15 years ago, when we met with Jiang at the first All-Union
      conference on parapsychology, scientists have argued about it,
      rustling newspapers and magazines. Someone thought he was a
      prophet of a new era, someone — a charlatan. Photographs obtained
      by non-genetic hybrids they went from hand to hand, to the delight
      and disbelief.<br>
      <br>
      Well, in fact, as you can relate to the chicken flat duck's beak
      and webbed, like waterfowl, between the claws on the feet, if it
      is known that the chicken does not cover the duck, and a rooster
      with a duck tricks never before seen? At the same time, Jiang is
      not a geneticist, a virtuoso who could spend the most delicate
      operation of permutation of units in the DNA molecule. He achieved
      this miracle of nature differently: irradiated chicken eggs
      biovolnami ducks.<br>
      <br>
      No less a sensation at the Academy selhoznauk produced bushy
      stalks of corn cobs with multiple radiating from a single "spike"
      as the wheat grain.<br>
      <br>
      And all this circus performers in the arena of science was not
      enough! Here cucumbers grown from seeds irradiated melon:
      yellowish fruit, egg-shaped, with a taste and aroma of melon.<br>
      <br>
      Pregnant rabbit 'bombarded' wave beam, taken from the goats — and
      rabbits on the upper jaw grew crooked teeth-shaped goat horns.<br>
      <br>
      Capital academia is kept on these experiments proud silence. Only
      the distance from Moscow boldest scientists decided to test and
      approve experiments Jiang: Novosibirsk academic-physician
      V.Kaznacheev gathered advanced workshop involving 130 scientists
      from five different institutions. Their approving the conclusion
      of Jiang and today is in the folder as a safe-conduct, fear of
      accusations of witchcraft, and in connection with the evil spirit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Student Head of Lab</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      In high school Kanchzhen as many utopian in the 50's, interested
      in robots and space technology itself was a decent radio
      technician. Leafed through the mountain of scientific and
      technical journals. In one of them had read about the experiences
      of rejuvenation with soda baths, which followed Lepeshinskaya then
      fascinated almost all Soviet intelligentsia. Competent Jiang did
      not believe in the soda bath, or in yogurt Mechnikov, but the very
      idea of rejuvenating the body on fire seriously. So much so that,
      having thrown your favorite radio technician entered the Shenyang
      Institute of Medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Only, unlike his fellow students, physics is not abandoned, but
      continued to study it. In those years, addicted to the idea of
      constructing an artificial brain. Jiang realized that at the
      intersection of neuroscience and cybernetics can find an approach
      to the mystery of life.<br>
      <br>
      He then read that a living cell fission emits ultraviolet light.
      But this part of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation. If
      around any cybernetic system always is the electromagnetic field,
      it must be operated around the brain.<br>
      <br>
      By high rates of medical school Jiang convinced: bioelectric field
      of a living organism operates in the microwave range. Inquisitive
      student teachers began to pull, let us measure the radiation of
      the brain. Came with their ideas to the rector. He took them
      seriously — he sent his work to check the Institute of Atomic
      Physics. From there she was sent to the Office of Science of the
      Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the highest in
      the era scientific body.<br>
      <br>
      Jiang was summoned to Beijing, where for a week with him the
      award-winning scientists. He was given the latest book on the
      theory of DNA, only recently established by that time. The idea of
      the relationship of the student bioelectromagnetic field to the
      information in the fine structures of the body, is so pleased with
      the commanders of Chinese science, that they took an unprecedented
      decision to create at Shenyang Medical College laboratory to test
      the hypothesis Jiang.<br>
      <br>
      After graduation, remaining as an assistant at the Department of
      Pathophysiology, continued to investigate the genetic effects of
      biofield. And in 1961, a young scientist built the first in the
      history of Biotron — a device for transmitting bioizlucheny from
      one organism to another. It was then, under the wing of Mao
      Zedong, one of the pillars of the global Marxism, there was a
      disgusting bourgeois chimera — chicken chicken with duck webbed
      paws.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Yuri, double con red empires</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      In the first half of the 60th China Red Guards were gaining
      momentum. Jiang was reminded that his grandfather was a wealthy,
      while his father and older brother did not sympathized with the
      revolution. When it was decided to classify the study Jiang's
      leadership, he realized that it was just a cover for an upcoming
      deal with it, the lab will inevitably be closed. Settle in another
      place renegade from Marxism, of course, will not allow.<br>
      <br>
      Then Kanchzhen decided to escape from China, which has already
      blazed a ruthless fire "cultural revolution." But where to go?
      Free Japan and South Korea are separated seas, India — snow peaks.
      There remained only the Soviet Union.<br>
      <br>
      In June 1966, began the first massacre committed by the Red
      Guards. And in September, taking advantage of holidays, Kanchzhen
      moved north. He entered unnoticed into the border zone to parting
      with nelaskovoy home had only four hours away. But he was
      detained.<br>
      <br>
      For attempting to cross the border Jiang was given four years of
      hard labor.<br>
      <br>
      After his release, looked into the university laboratory is not,
      the installation was broken. On the scientific work is not out of
      the question. Jiang got to take care of the pigs, and then cleaned
      the toilets.<br>
      His second attempt to cross the border in the 71 th year this time
      was successful. Kanchzhen knew that the risk is greater than the
      first time: the time has come steeper, and if caught with a repeat
      offender will not stand on ceremony.<br>
      <br>
      But fate was kind: the Soviet border guards handed emaciated, had
      spent a week without eating Chinese in Khabarovsk, where he
      identified only two years of work in the timber industry
      enterprise.<br>
      To learn more or less explained in Russian, Jiang took his Russian
      name and patronymic — now his name is Yuri. Probably kept going
      naive Chinese, namesake of the all-powerful head of the Lubyanka
      will get not so active.<br>
      <br>
      Upon the motion of the Moscow Institute of Oncology, where Jiang's
      work know, it was a laboratory assistant in the Khabarovsk Medical
      Institute (a medical degree was in China — about the work of the
      profession had nothing to dream.)<br>
      <br>
      <b>Silent genes talking?</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Only in 1986 a fugitive in China rehabilitated, allowing relatives
      to request a duplicate diploma and send it to Jiang. In
      Khabarovsk, he proved that he has mastered the technique of
      acupuncture, a doctor and enrolled in the railway hospital.<br>
      <br>
      By the time he re-established the Biotron at home and experimented
      with plants and animals.<br>
      <br>
      Jiang made in practice: in the microwave range is transmitted
      hereditary information. In the DNA chain is known to be active
      genes — from 1 to 5 percent. The remaining 95-99% — the so-called
      silent genes. Why do they even need not known. Jiang implies: they
      are included only in the fetal period. So, experiments on biotron
      allowed Jiang to believe that microwaves excite silent, timeless
      genes that are awakened to an active life. And already they
      synthesize young squirrels.<br>
      <br>
      By irradiating a first biotron mice, then himself, then many
      patients, Jiang received the effect that he calls rejuvenation:
      after a month of regular exposures sprouted wheat germ, peas,
      corn, barley, sorghum — in short, diverse edible crops — the
      physiological age of the patient is reduced an average of five and
      a half years. This eliminates many chronic diseases, increases
      immunity, sexual function returns.<br>
      <br>
      In 1992, a Russian citizen Yuri Tszyankanchzhen (do not laugh — it
      is written in an official document) has received a patent for a
      way to change the hereditary characteristics of the biological
      object and device for directional transmission of biological
      information. Four years later — another patent, where it is
      written: "The process of rejuvenation." A year later — the third
      patent for a device called "Biotron Jiang."<br>
      <br>
      <b>How to chew apples of youth?</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Of the 600 men, regenerate in 15 years biotron the direct
      participation of Jiang's, I had a talk with one. Eugene P.
      Ishchenko — Professor of Law Academy, the man, as they say, quite
      sane.<br>
      - I met with Jiang in 1990, and in 1992, when together with his
      friend on a business trip to Khabarovsk, underwent rejuvenation. I
      was only 46 years old, a year before I came out of a kidney stone,
      sand, and remained small stones, after working on his doctoral
      dissertation weakened eyesight, prescribed glasses. In Khabarovsk,
      I spent thirty nights under irradiation. At first, my friend and I
      were treated to experiment with skepticism. But already during the
      course of his chest noticeably blackened gray hair. I'm at the end
      of the course the ultrasound showed absence of sand and stones in
      the kidney, no glasses needed a few more years. According to my
      subjective assessment, five years in Khabarovsk I just left. For a
      month, conducted in the laboratory Jiang, we have seen children
      with cerebral palsy who are after the course of treatment at the
      Biotron, began to run, to dance, to laugh, a girl with scabs on
      the skin due to neurodermatitis completely cleared the skin.
      Regional prosecutor's office at the behest of the then head of the
      region, which is called the land of the snout — only to find a
      basis for initiating a criminal case against Jiang. But did not
      find any patient who would after treatment, Jiang became worse.<br>
      But still, is it Rejuvenation? Or simply a beneficial effect on
      the body? Are we to say about the turn back the subjective time of
      the organism? These are the questions I asked a world-famous
      explorer of psychic phenomena, Doctor of Biological and Medical
      Sciences Alexander Petrovich Dubrov, a quarter-century familiar
      with Jiang Kanchzhenom.<br>
      <br>
      - Jiang — MD, a talented scientist and inventor. I am convinced
      that Biotron should be widely promoted as a panacea for the
      rehabilitation of patients after an illness. But what are the
      mechanisms to achieve a positive effect on the impact of biotron
      living objects — a multi-faceted issue of the scientific research
      that Jiang, in my opinion, for various reasons, can not hold their
      own. Need a reliable medical statistics, need deep physics
      research that Jiang calls bioelectric field, we need
      collaborations with eminent Russian scientists who study the wave
      nature of the genetic effects. Only after all of these studies, we
      can once again raise the question of the possibility of
      rejuvenation.<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      [Purpose] Observation on the biological effect of
      Bioelectromagnetic (BEM) field carrying the vital information in
      microwave band radiated from organism<br>
      <br>
      [Method] The field guide Biotron was used, which was designed and
      made by Jiang kan-zheng according to the principles of microwave
      reflective and focusing, transmission of wave guide tube, and
      tuning with resonant cavity and tune bolt. The donor organism
      placed in the receive cabin of the Biotron and the donee organism
      placed in the treatment cabin, so the donor's BEM through the
      Biotron act on the donee. No tangible contact existed between the
      donor and the donee except the contact of the BEM field between
      them, and this process was called as "field guide". After
      remaining in field guide for a certain period, the biological
      effect of donee organism was detected.<br>
      <br>
      [Result] hi the biological effect: receiving the field guide of
      wheat, corn acquired the characteristics of wheat; receiving the
      field guide of muskmelon, cucumber acquired the characteristics of
      muskmelon; receiving the field guide of young plants or animal
      embryos, the activities of the cell DNA of various organs of the
      mice were invigorated, sexual function enhanced and survival time
      prolonged; when human body received the field guide of young
      plants, the results were that the velocity of nervous reflection
      was accelerated, hematopoietic activity invigorated, immune
      (unction strengthened and sexual function enhanced with the effect
      of anti-aging.<br>

      <b>1. Introduction</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      In 1957, Jiang Kanzheng put forward the Theory of "Held guide" in
      China Medical University in Shenyang, and pointed out that
      biological organism could transmit bioelectromagnetic (BEM) wave
      internally and externally in the processes of its vital activities
      and accompanying with the biochemical changes within the organism.
      The BEM wave carried genetic information, which controlled the
      organism and could also act on another biological organism to
      influence its genetic gene. Jiang designated the phenomenon as
      "Field guide". Theoretically, BEM wave should exist in microwave
      band. In 1981, according to the known transformation low of
      physi-... ???<br>
      <br>
      When the germinating seeds were used, suits the temperature, humid
      and fresh air were kept inside and outside me Biotron to make the
      seeds germinating continuously.<br>
      <br>
      In the 5* 2weeks: 90 hatching eggs were taken out from incubator
      and put in the Biotron, 2 hours later were sent back to the
      incubator, then another batch of hatching eggs were taken out from
      the incubator and put in the Biotron and were also changed in such
      2 way after 2 hours. The eggs in the Biotron were also kept in
      best preservation.<br>
      <br>
      In the 6th 2weeks: 10 rabbit pregnant for one week were used.<br>
      <br>
      The done, experiment group dividing 3 batches, every batch have
      100 mice. Each batch were put in the Biotron and stayed for 8
      hours.<br>
      <br>
      The indexes of observation: Periodically counting of the survival
      number of mice, number of the pregnant and number of the birth in
      order to judge the result of anti-aging and life prolongation of
      the tested mice.<br>
      <br>

      The birth number 57 564<br>
      <br>
      Brief conclusion: The number of mice surviving after 1.5 years of
      the experiment group is significantly larger than that of the
      control group. The number of pregnant mice and average number of
      birth of the experiment group are also larger than those of the
      control group. It is shown diat the life of animals of the
      experiment group was prolonged and their sexual function
      invigorated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. 2. 1.2 Experiment 2</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The experiment was conducted in khabarovsk laboratory of Russia in
      1992. the purpose was to study analytically the anti-aging effect
      of aged mice with the method of autohistoradiography.<br>
      The donors of BEM field were seedlings of wheat and corn of 6m2
      each. The seedlings, 5-25cm above die soil, were grown by close
      planting in pots. 44femalemice aged 12 months were selected as the
      donees, the tested animals, and divided randomly into experiment
      group and control group, with 22 in each group. The experimental
      environment and raising conditions were the same for both of them.
      The animals of the two groups were put in the Biotron alternately.
      When the animals of the control group were put in the Biotron,
      donors were not put in. they were in it once for 24 hours and 10
      times for each group. They were observed for 20 days.<br>
      <br>
      10 mice were taken out randomly at the end of the field guide.
      Firstly, vaginal smears were made to observe the sexual cycle.
      Then 3H-Thymine (1570kBq/mol) was injected intraperitoneally
      (22.2kBq/lg of body weight), and 3 times of the dose of 3H-Thymine
      (i.e. 0.2ml) was dripped into the right eye because of no blood
      supply in the cornea. After 3H-Thmine had already distributed over
      the organs, two eyes, thyroid gland, thymus, adrenal gland,
      spleen, stomach, ovary were taken out, the right side organs were
      to make slices for autohistoradiography. The cell nucleus with
      more than 5 radio-loci was regarded as labeled nucleus. The Ratio
      of the amount of labeled nuclei to the total nuclei observed was
      the index of labeled nucleus. The labeled intensity was calculated
      according to the number of silver grains on 30 labeled nuclei.
      Pathological mitoses were calculated with the serial sections of
      comea of the right eye. For the rest 12 mice in each group, body
      weight was measured before and after the experiment; besides,
      ovary, adrenal gland, brain, heart, liver, spleen, lungs and
      kidneys, were taken out, weighed and made into slices for light
      microscopy.<br>
      <br>
      Results: There were no obvious differences between me experiment
      group and the control group in the relative weight and cellular
      structure under the light microscope of all the organs except
      ovary. However, the increase of body weight of the mice in the
      experiment group was obviously lower than that in the control
      group (p&lt;0.05). The test results of the method of
      autohistoradiography image showed obvious differences between the
      two groups. (Table 2)<br>

      In the above table, indexes of labeled nucleus and labeled density
      are the indexes reflecting the active intensity of cell DNA. The
      more obvious changes occurring in the experiment group than in the
      control group showed that the BEM field of plant seedlings made
      the activities of cell DNA of the organs of the aged mice
      strengthened and the activities of sexual organs become vigorous
      ,and pamological nuclear divisions weakened.<br>
      <br>
      Brief conclusion: After the mice of the experiment group receive
      the action of the field guide of BEM wave, the activities of cell
      DNA of every organ are invigorated, the renewal of physiological
      cells strengthened and the pathological cellular division
      weakened. This may be the physiological basis for the function of
      reproduction system to become vigorous and for the anti-aging
      phenomenon to occur.<br>

      <b>2.3 Experiment of Anti-aging of Human Body</b><br>
      <br>
      In 1998, according to Jiang kan-zheng's technique, field guide
      Biotron was mad in Yiyang City of Hunan Province of China to
      observe with post-test the action of BEM wave transmitted from
      plant seedlings to improve human health and fight against
      senility.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.3.1 Material and Method</b><br>
      <br>
      Donor The four kinds of edible plant seedlings of wheat, corn, pea
      and sorghum were closely planted in plastic pots of 30x20cm.
      respectively under room temperature. Each time 30 pots were put in
      the Biotron according to the proportion of 50%wheat, 20%corn,
      20%pea and 10% sorghum. The donors were used specially for one man
      only. The seedlings were changed once for 4 hours, and were
      abandoned and renewed at height of above 25cm.<br>
      <br>
      Donee The human bodies for observation were from 35 volunteers. Of
      them 26 were males, aged 9-74 and 9 female, aged 22-72. Every one
      stayed 4 hours in the field guide Biotron. There were ventilation
      and light installation and bedding in it to keep comfort. In it
      one could sit, lie down, take diet, read, talk, sleep, without
      taking medicine and touching the plant seedlings and could go out
      freely. 10 days were a treatment course, after 10 days, there was
      an interval of 10 days for rest; after the interval the second
      treatment course of another 10 days began; then after another
      interval of 10 days, the third treatment course began. In 50 days,
      120 hours of field guide were received in all.<br>
      <br>
      In the observation of human body, besides the general physical
      examination, emphasis was put on the examination of nervous
      system, immune system, endocrine system, sexual function,
      hemopoietic function, etc. which was carried out before and after
      receiving field guide so as to make same body contrast Results:

      It was observed from the indexes of the above table that after
      receiving the field guide: (1) the velocity of nervous conduction
      accelerated and the nervous function enhanced, (2) muscular
      strength was increased, (3) equilibrium function was improved, (4)
      fiagilocytes were reduced and hematopietie function become
      vigorous, (5) concentration of serum thyroid hormone was higher
      and metabolism was invigorated, (6) concentration of sexual
      hormone was higher, sexual function was enhanced and one become
      younger, (7) immunocytes in blood increased and immune function
      was enhanced, (8) the ratio of body fat showed that the
      constitution become strong in the weak and lean, obesity was
      reduced in the obese and no change occurred in those of moderate
      health, (9) concentration of serum glucocorticoid did not increase
      but tended to decrease, which showed that the processes of field
      guide had not aroused press reaction of the body and was no
      harmful to human body, and (10) relative vital capacity increased
      remarkably. With reference to the calculation of The Contrast
      table of between Relative Vital Capacity and biological Ages"
      published by Professor Wang yong-yan of Shanghai Medical
      University [8], the biological ages of the 35 persons observed in
      the group become younger by 5.6 years averagely. For the observed
      persons who with different kinds of chronic diseases, a great of
      their symptoms were improved remarkably [9].<br>

      Brief conclusion: The BEM field of plant has the effect of making
      human constitution younger and

      <b>3. Discussion and Conclusion of the Experiment Result of
        Biological Field Guide</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      3.1. Microwave equipment was used in the experiment of biological
      field guide. The result showed that the influence of the
      biological organism (donee) in the treatment cabin received the
      influence of the biological organism (donor) in the receiving
      cabin. And the influential factor must be received by the
      microwave receiving antenna, transmitted though wave guide tube,
      tuned with tuner and tuning bolt and transmitted by transmitting
      antenna to act on the donee. Between the donor and the donee there
      is no other way of contact except that through microwave because
      the microwave device can receive, tune and transmit microwave
      only.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion: In the processes of vital activities, organism can
      transmit BEM wave (biomicrowave) of microwave band. Field guide
      experiment for various kinds of biological organisms confirms that
      the organism can transmit microwave, and the biomicrowave
      transmitted by the donor can act on the donee and influence the
      processes of vital activities of it<br>
      <br>
      3.2. The BEM waves transmitted from biological organism act on the
      donee to promote them to vary their genetic features in the
      direction of the characteristic of the transmissive source, the
      organisms (donors). The fact that the variation acquired can pass
      on from generation to generation can support the judgment It is
      then shown that BEM wave carries genetic information (BEM wave
      genetic information).<br>
      <br>
      3.3. No morphologic change and result of increase in production
      have been observed from the experiment of putting wheat of low
      production under the field guide of wheat of high production. It
      can also be observed 11 comparison with other experiments that BEM
      microwave transmitted from heterogeneous organism can cause the
      genetic features of donee to be varied but BEM microwave
      transmitted from the organism of the same species can not.<br>
      <br>
      3.4. Genetics has made known that active gene (coding protein
      structure gene) accounts for 1-5% of all genes in the gene group.
      The rest 95%-98% genes are called inactive gene (potential genes)
      by the authors. The active gene is to pass on the genetic
      information to RNA according to the central principle of DNA
      duplex splitting, andRNA conlrols thecombination of amino acids
      though information andfinally protein is synthesized. Inactive
      gene (potential gene) does not take part in the control of protein
      synthesis. The results of biological field guide experiment show
      that there are new active genes in the donee in field guide, which
      are similar in nature to the active genes of the field guide
      sources (for instance. Duck web grown on chicken's claws conform
      to that controlled by active genes of duck, side stems on the corn
      stalk and corn ears with wheat seeds conform to those controlled
      by active genes of wheat, cucumber tike round ball and containing
      more sugar and protem conforms to that controlled by active genes
      of muskmelon, etc.), It is shown that the biological wave
      transmitted from heterogeneous organism has genetic information of
      the active gene of the organism, which activated the inactive gene
      (potential gene) of the donee in the field guide to synthesize
      relevant protein and, as a result, variations with relevant
      genetic characteristics of the organism, the field guide source,
      occur. The variation is the directional genetic variation so that
      a new species of good nature and high production is obtained
      speedily and can not be degenerated easily.<br>
      <br>
      3.5. Receiving the field guide of biomicrowave transmitted from
      heterogeneous organism, the aged mice may recover their youthful
      vigor; i.e. the information of active gene carried by biological
      microwave of heterogeneous young organism activates the inactive
      gene of the mice to synthesize relevant anti-aging protein, and
      the effect of recovering youthful vigor results. That is to say,
      the inactive gene (potential gene) is the anti-aging gene. The
      cells of organism contain 95%-98%potential genes.<br>
      <br>
      The activity information of active gene carries by biological
      microwave of heterogeneous young organism can activate the
      anti-aging potential gene of the donee (including the old of 70-80
      years old),and synthesize protein of the nature of youthful
      organism to make the aged younger.<br>
      <br>
      3.6. m recent 10 years, field guide Biotron was used for many
      people, who received biological microwave transmitted from various
      plant seedlings for recovery of youthful vigor and health
      convalescence. Their nervous reilective function was improved,
      endocrine function regulated, and sexual function recovered.
      Beside their chronic diseases were relieved or eliminated without
      any adverse reaction.<br>
      <br>
      3.7. The action of biological microwave and its field guide can be
      used in agriculture. The application of it in directional breeding
      of plants and animals may save much time and labour. In medicine,
      it can be used to regulate physiological function, improve
      constitution, enhance physical strength and take effect of
      anti-aging, disease resistance and health protection. In addition,
      it can also be used for reducing obesity and cosmetics. Rich
      experience have been collected in the experimental study of
      several decades the biological microwave and the field guide
      effect and the information brought about by BEM field are, after
      all, new things, which still need more deepened researches. Once
      it is applied widely in either agriculture or medicine tremendous
      economic benefit and social influence can be produced (The end)<br>

      The invention relates to biology and in particular to gerontology
      and may be used for rejuvenation of organisms.<br>
      <br>
      It is known to use a systematic point of cauterization of
      longevity to achieve longevity, but not proven link between
      longevity and rejuvenation of the human body, and the relationship
      of these factors with the cautery point of longevity.<br>
      <br>
      There is a method of rejuvenation with the use of
      xenotransplantation gonads animals to humans.<br>
      <br>
      Founder of Immunology II Mechnikov believed that aging occurs due
      to the formation of toxins in the intestines and autointoxication
      them.<br>
      <br>
      In order to combat this phenomenon, he suggested that lactic acid
      food products.<br>
      <br>
      Academician of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR OV
      Lepeshinskaia offered its own method of dealing with aging: soda
      baths.<br>
      <br>
      However, this method is achieved by only a slight improvement in
      the skin.<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the invention is to improve the process efficiency due
      to the normalization of physiological processes.<br>
      <br>
      This goal is achieved by that in the known method comprises
      subjecting the organism, exposure is performed donor biological
      field, which is used as sprouted seeds and embryos of birds and
      animals, exposure to donor and recipient areas placed at the
      focus, and exposure is carried out for three months for 7-9 hours
      per day according to the scheme.<br>
      <br>
      The drawing shows an apparatus for carrying out the method.<br>
      <br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      One of the focuses of the scope of the objects placed donor and
      the other anti-aging focus to the recipient.<br>
      <br>
      The impact on the recipient is carried out in the three months to
      7-9 hours a day.<br>
      <br>
      Used as the donor germinated seeds and embryos of animals and
      birds, and the seeds are used as a donor for two months, two weeks
      change the form of seeds, and every day replace fresh.<br>
      <br>
      Animal or bird embryos were used as donor in the last month.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE </b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b><b>Example 1.</b><br>
      <br>
      For the experiment, took a two-year 300 white mice, the control
      group was also 300 animals. 100 animals were placed in a focus
      sphere diameter of 1 m<br>
      <br>
      As donors have used the first two weeks germinated within three
      days of pea seeds, replacing them every day, in the next two
      weeks, three-day germinated seeds of wheat, in the next two weeks,
      three-day germinated seeds of soybean, in the fourth three-day
      germinated seeds of beans.<br>
      <br>
      The mass of each portion of the donor 2 kg (up to germination).<br>
      <br>
      Within the scope for germination of seeds to create the necessary
      conditions for life: moisture, temperature, flow of fresh air.<br>
      <br>
      As a donor to the fifth couple of weeks used hatching eggs of
      chickens (90 pcs.).<br>
      <br>
      Eggs are changed every two hours, maintaining their temperature.<br>
      <br>
      In the last couple of weeks, the donor rabbit was pregnant
      (pregnancy 1 week).<br>
      <br>
      Sessions lasted for three months to 7-9 hours a day.<br>
      <br>
      The test results are shown in Table.<br>
      <br>
      The experiments carried out confirmed the rejuvenation of the
      recipient, but for the offspring of the recipient is not harmless.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore rejuvenation is recommended only after the end of their
      childbearing years.<br>
      <br>
      Example Example 2.<br>
      <br>
      The experiment was conducted on the author of the scheme outlined
      in Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      We obtained the following results.<br>
      <br>
      There was a subjective improvement in general condition, increase
      mental performance and efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Others showed improvement in appearance, fewer wrinkles, receding
      hairline covered with hair.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the proposed method leads to rejuvenation of the human and
      the animal.<br>

      transmitting information natural food in the home.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the device can be used to transmit information of natural
      food not only humans but also biosamples another species.<br>
      <br>
      For example, can be placed in the focus area antenna impact
      germinated seeds and vegetable crops, fruit, fodder grasses and
      medicinal plants, flowers, seeds, trees and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      As a source of bio-field thus chosen so that the characteristics
      of the object that you wish to influence.<br>
      <br>
      For example, it is planned to grow corn with multiple stems and
      high yield, and grain with high protein content.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, used as a source of bio culture of wheat.<br>
      <br>
      A result: yield 30 to 100% higher than the control group, a high
      specific protein content.<br>
      <br>
      Or, for example, is scheduled to grow cucumbers with unique aroma
      and taste.<br>
      <br>
      To do this as a source of bio-field, being placed in the device 10
      on a stand, use a lot of green melon (stem, leaf) or the fruit of
      pineapple, apple, tangerine and so on.<br>
      <br>

      The invention relates to immunology, in particular to the
      regulation of the body's immunological after various pathological
      states.<br>
      <br>
      There are known methods of non-specific active immunotherapy,
      including the use of vaccines and microbial agents.<br>
      <br>
      Also known method of regulation of specific immunity, in which
      drugs are injected into the body (immunoglobulin G and M) from the
      blood of patients with leukemia.<br>
      <br>
      However, these methods are not effective in controlling the immune
      status accompanying pathological processes, such as tumors,
      allergies, transplant.<br>
      <br>
      The aim of the invention is to improve the effectiveness of
      regulation of immunological activity of the body pathologies.<br>
      <br>
      This goal is achieved by that in the known method comprises
      subjecting the organism pathological material grafted donor
      animal, whereupon the animal donor and the recipient is placed in
      a device for the transmission of biological information.<br>
      <br>
      The method is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      In immunologically attenuated organism, e.g. in mouse tumor, the
      tumor material is collected and its grafted mice and rabbits.<br>
      <br>
      Thus mice also developed tumors and decreased immune status of the
      organism, while the rabbit is not observed the formation of
      tumors.<br>
      <br>
      After that, the mice exposed to bio rabbit, resulting in an
      appreciable increase in immune status of mice.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Example</b>.<br>
      <br>
      In an experiment using 300 female white mice, aged 0.5 years, the
      same number of mice was the control. 15 rabbits were used.<br>
      <br>
      0.2 ml of the ascitic fluid from an animal with a transplantable
      tumor Ermeha mice injected once, and 2 ml of rabbits three times
      at intervals of one week.<br>
      <br>
      The animals were then placed in an apparatus for directional
      transmission of biological information, or sphere, or a microwave
      lens, wherein in use as the recipient mouse, and as a donor
      rabbit.<br>
      <br>
      Mice were constantly on the device, and the rabbits were divided
      into two groups and took turns alternately.<br>
      <br>
      All the control mice die within 7-10 days in the test group during
      7-10 days 25% of the animals die, but within 30 months in 40% of
      animals% normalization occurred cells (tumors are benign), the
      remaining <br>
      <br>
      30% of animals tumor disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the proposed method can improve the immunological status in
      70% of animals with cancer.<br>

          <b>Field of the invention </b><br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to the field that ensures the
          maintaining of vitality of a biological object or possible
          change of its features, namely, to a device for transmitting a
          natural information supply to a biological object. This device
          allows to transmit to the object a genetical information which
          is stored in deoxynucleic acicl (DNA) of the source that is
          located at a distance from t:he object by means of the
          influence of a bioelectromagnetic field to the object's
          molecules. Background of the invention A method of
          transmitting genetical material to the cells of Actinomyces is
          known in the art. Also- known is generation of new species of
          animals by means of separation of a gene coding a specific
          hormone homologous to that available at the ovum. (EP,
          Application # 0061253, Cl. 12N 15/00, 1982). However, in these
          cases it is necessary to interfe- re into the cell's structure
          which involves some technical difficulties; there is a
          necessity of observance of the steritlity of the experiment,
          and the use of precision equipment. (PCT, Application WO
          088(08026, Cl. C12]~ 15/00, 1988). Besides, these methods do
          not ensure the possibilities of rejuvenescent and curing
          effects on the biolo- gical object, especially a human being.
          To continue vital activity a live body constantly receives
          from 30 its environment an energy supply coming from air and
          foods which contain proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vi- tam.ns,
          mineral substances, and water. They contribute to its growth
          and metabolism. However, they can not slow down the process of
          aging. In the process of its vital activity the body's atoms
          and molecules are interconnected by bioelectromagnetic<br>
          <br>
          [0003]<br>
          &nbsp;fields that are unitary material carriers of biological
          information and energy. Replenishment of the biofield of the
          object or its individual organs can be effected by
          transmitting a natural information supply received from
          another live object. There is known device for transmitting a
          natural information supply to a biological object comprising a
          source of biofield and a means for housing the source and the
          object (SU Inventor's Certificate # 1593670 Cl. A61N 5/06
          1989). As a source of biofield can be used the hands of the
          operator who is carrying out specific movements of his hands
          near the body of the object. Simultaneously with this the
          biological object is influenced by an 15 alternating electric
          field and infrared radiation. The operator is a source of
          superhigh frequency radiation. And due to the fact t:hat any
          live cell is a small radiator of electromagnetic waves of a
          superhigh frequency band the operator transmits to the
          object/receiver 20 a biological information replenishes the
          biofield of the object/receiver and energizes it. In doing so,
          the curing effect takes place. However in this case is sued a
          source of information supply of the same species as the
          biological object/ 25 receiver. In doing so the source is used
          many times for working with various objects. But it is known
          that biofield exerts mutual influence. That is why the source
          receives from the object a pernicious influence that can be
          transmitted to other objects during his 30 inte]course with
          them. Besides the influence of the biofield is not so
          efficient because it takes place directly between two
          biological objects and is not amplified by any instruments.<br>
          <br>
          <b>[0004] Summary of the Invention</b><br>
          <br>
          This invention is aimed at the solution of a technical task of
          elimination of a possible pernicious influence on a biological
          object of a source's biofield that has been harmfully affected
          during its intercourse with another object, the invention is
          also aimed at the raising of efficiency of the beneficial
          influence on -the object and its consumption of a natural
          information supply. The raised task of the invention is
          attained due to 1:he fact that the device for transmitting a
          natural information supply to a biological object includes a
          source of biofield and means for housing the source and the
          object and comprises a chamber assembly having a housing, two
          antenna systems each of which having a reflector and a
          microwave lens mounted coaxially with the respective
          reflector, the first antenna system being secured to one side
          of the housing in such a manner as t:o form a compartment for
          reception of an information supply from the source of biofield
          while the second antenna system is secured to the opposite
          side of the housing to form a compartment for influencing a
          biological object, means for placing a source of biofield and
          the biological object being located in the zone of focus 25 of
          the respective antenna systems while near the latter mean.s
          from the side opposite to the antenna system is mounted a
          group of microwave lenses. Implementation of the said device
          in the form of a chamber assembly, comprising a housing and
          two antenna systems as well as availability of an additional
          system of lenses and its location at a focus distance from a
          biological object, ensures the possibility of a more complete
          taking away of an information supply and its focused
          transmittance to the object. Implementation of said antenna
          systems in the form of a reflector and location of a microwave
          lens mounted coaxially with it<br>
          <br>
          [0005] (or secured to it) ensures the increase of the
          amplification coefficient and the directional action of the
          systems. Said housing may have a cylindrical form with antenna
          systems being secured to its end sides. Implementation of said
          housing in this form ensures easiness of use of the device
          which is manifested in the possibility of easy replacement of
          the source of biofield and, as a result, in shortening of time
          needed for carrying out this operation. Said housing may have
          such a design that together with said antenna systems secured
          to its opposite sides there is formed a chamber in the form of
          a sphere or a chamber the section of which has the form of an
          ellipse. Such a form of the chamber ensures high mechanical
          rigidity and high percentage of a natural information supply
          received by the object. It is recommended to separate said
          compartments by partition secured inside said housing and made
          of such a material that the bioelectromagnetic radiation can
          penetrate through it. This creates more comfortable conditions
          in the compartment for a bioobject due to elimination of the
          possibility for the smell and noise from the source of a
          biofield to penetrate into it. In case of the necessity to
          transmit a natural information supply to a small object, for
          example, embryos, cells, it is necessary to supplement the
          second&nbsp; antenna system with a convex metal mirror located
          in the zone of the focus of the reflector and lens and facing
          with its convex side the reflector thus ensuring concentration
          of electromagnetic radiation of the biofield into a narrow
          beam for its direction onto a small object. In this case the
          total resulting focus of said antenna system will shift closer
          to said reflector. A small biological object placed into that
          zone will receive an electromagnetic flow of higher density <br>
          <br>
          [0007] resulting in the increase of its effect. It is
          recommended to use as a source of biofield some young plants
          with the period of vegetation of 1 to 2 weeks from the
          beginning of vegetation or some large or small animals at the
          age up to the first half of their growth. At such a stage of
          growth cells are in an active state of division and, as a
          result, have more active biofields due to which the effect on
          the biological object/receiver is greater. Such a design of
          said device allows to eliminate a pernicious effect of one
          biological object-receiver ) on the other which may take place
          when the influence on objects/receivers is exerted only by one
          operator used as a source of biofield. With the present device
          in each case is used an individual, young, healthy, and strong
          source of biofield which has not yet interacted with another
          biological object. Besides, during the course of treatment the
          source of biofield may be easily changed to a new one
          several~times. This results in the raising of the degree of
          transmittance of a full-fledged natural information supply
          and, consequently, a fuller replenishment of the biofield of
          the object which gives positive results in treatment,
          rejuvenation of human being or change of features of an animal
          or a plant. Brief Description of the Drawings This invention

          lens 7 mounted coaxially with it. The second antenna system
          comprises reflector 8 and microwave lens g mounted coaxially
          with it. Housing 1 may have a cylindrical form (FIG.l). Said
          antenna systems should be secured to its end sides. In doing
          so, it is recommended to use reflectors 6,8 hav:ing a
          parabolic form. Housing 1 may have such a design that together
          with said antenna systems, secured to its opposite sides, it
          forms a spherical chamber (Fig .6). Housing 1 may have such a
          design that together with said antenna systems secured to its
          opposite sides it forms an elliptic chamber (FIG.7).<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Each reflector 6,8 is secured by its end side to
          mounting frame 10 (FIG.4, 5) by means of eyes 11. Said frame
          has a support system comprising plate 12, mounted on a
          foundation, and inclined columns 13. Each reflector 6, 8 at
          its edges has flanges to which are secured rods 14 which
          encompass cylindrical housing 1 to ensure its rigidity.
          Housing 1 has a support made in the form of bed 15. In housing
          1 for compartments 2 and 4 are provided doors 16, 17 (FIG.2,
          3) being a part of the surface of housing 1 and having for the
          cylindrical design of ) housing 1 a form of an arc. In
          spherical or elliptic designs of said chambers doors 16, 17
          have the forms of a part of a sphere and a part of an
          ellipsoid respectively. Doors 16 and 17 are secured to columns
          18, 19 by means of hinged joints (FIG. 2, 3). In compartment 2
          in the zone of focus of the first antenna system is provided
          means for placing source 3 of biofield; such means may be
          designed in the form of movable shelf 20 (FIG.1, 2, 6, 7)
          having wheels 21.&nbsp; Shelf 20 is mounted on support
          platform 22 located opposite door 16. Platform 22 is secured
          on columns 23 passing through slots in housing 1 and is
          supported on said foundation. Platform 22 has side guides 24
          (FIG.1, 2) for wheels 21 of shelf 20. Behind this assembly is
          installed a limiter of shelf movement (not illustrated,l. In
          compartment 4 in the zone of focus of the second antenna
          system is provided a means for placing of one or more
          biological objects 5; said means is made in the form of
          multiplier or single-tier bed 25 (FIG.1,6,7) supporting
          elements of which through said slots in housing 1 are mounted
          on said foundation. Housing 1 has floor 26 for people to move
          around. Supports 27 for said floor are located in such a way<br>
          <br>
          [0010] that they through cylindrical housing 1 are supported
          on bed 15. Compartments 2 and 4 may be separated by means of
          partition 28 (FIG.l) secured in housing 1 and made of the
          material that. can be-penetrated by the bioelectromagnetic
          field, for example, of polyethylene (or coloured polyethylene)
          or foam plastic. Housing 1 has several apertures 29 (FIG.1)
          covered with a small mesh brass lattice (mesh size: up to 1
          mm) for communication with the environment. Near said means
          for placing a biological object ) at the side opposite to the
          second antenna system is mounted a group of microwave lenses
          30 (FIG.l, 6, 7) the number of which corresponds to the number
          of tiers of bed 25 used for placing bioobjects. Support 31 of
          lens system 30 is located on floor 26. It is possible to
          provide a regulated movement of said lenses horizontally and
          vertically. Total area of all said lenses must not exceed 10%
          of the cross-sectional area of housing 1. In housing 1 are
          installed conventional lamps 32 and quartz lamps 33. The
          second antenna system may be supplemented additionally with
          convex metal mirror 34 (FIG.8) located in the zone of
          reflector 8 and lens 9 and facing by its convex side said
          reflector to ensure the concentra- tion of the electromagnetic
          radiation of biofield into a narrow beam. It is recommended to
          use it in case of influence on a small biological object. The
          operation of said device for transmitting a natural
          information supply to a biological object shall be performed
          in the following way. Through door 17 biological objects, for
          example, several people, enter compartment 4 and are placed on
          tiers of bed 25 while through door 16 to compartment 2 is
          delivered movable shelf 20 on the shelves of which are placed
          sources 3 of biofields. In the capacity of<br>
          <br>
          [0011] such sources may be used young plants with the period
          of 1 to 2 weeks from the beginning of vegetation, for example,
          wheat, corn, peas, soy beans, cabbage, flowers grown in flower
          pots and their crops without thorns. Seeding of gxains shall
          be done so densely that adjacent grains must contact each
          other. During the course of treatment the pots with-the plants
          must be replaced every 2 hours. As a source of biofield may
          also be used animals at the age of half the period of their
          growth (for example, mice, hares, rabbits, dogs, deer, bears,
          etc). They shall be put into cages made of non-metallic
          material. The duration of a course of treatment must be from 2
          to 4 hours daily for replenishment of the biofield and 8 hours
          daily for rejuvenation. It is recommended to proceed 10
          courses of treatment. The use of biofields of animals is
          allowed only for those persons who do not plan to have
          children further on. The first antenna system accepts the
          bioelectromagnetic radiation from that side of source 3 of
          biofield that faces that system, forms and opens a flat phase
          front and directs it to second antenna system 4. Then, from
          that system said bioelectromagnetic radiation is ) focused
          into the focus zone of that system where is located biological
          object 5 (or several objects 5). In that zone is formed a
          structure of said bioelectromagnetic field similar to that of
          the source. That biofield exerts influence on object 5
          ensuring transmittance to it of a natural information supply.
          The bioelectromagnetic radiation from the side of source 3 of
          biofield that does not face the first antenna system is
          received by first microwave lens group 30, is focused and
          transmitted by those lenses to specific&nbsp; areas of
          biological object 5 that especially are in need of reception
          of a natural information supply. The device can also be used
          for transmitting a<br>
          <br>
          [0012]&nbsp;&nbsp; natural information supply not only to a
          human being but also to bio-objects of other species. For
          example, one can place into compartment 4 in the zone of focus
          of the second antenna system germinated seeds of vegetable and
          grain crops, fruits, fodder grass, medicinal plants, flowers,
          tree seeds, etc. As source 3 of biofield shall be selected
          such species the features of which is necessary to transmit to
          the object/recipient. For example, if the objective is to grow
          corn with multiple stems, high yield and grains containing
          higher amounts cf roteiL.s. In this case s source 3 field must
          be used wheat crop. The result achieved: crop yield is from 30
          to 100% higher than in the reference group, with a higher
          average content of protein. If, for example, it is planned to
          grow cucumbers having a specific scent and taste. For that
          purpose as source 3 of biofield must be used green mass of
          melon (stem, leaves) or fruits of pineapple, apples,
          mandarins, etc. The resulting cucumbers have a taste of melon,
          pine-apple, etc., i.e. the taste of the biofield source. The
          duration of the treatment course is 3 to 4 days without
          interruption but source 3 shall be changed to a new one
          approximately every 4 hours. Germinated seeds during the
          course of treatment shall be maintained moistened, and are
          washed 2 or 3 times a day with pure water.After the treatment
          seeding in the field may be implemented. It is also possible
          to exert such influence on embryos, cells, and tissues of
          animals. In doing so, it is expedient to use the device
          (FIG.8) in which the second antenna system is provided with
          convex metal mirror 34 located in the zone of focus of
          reflector 8 and lens 9. Biological object 5 is located in the
          zone of focus of the whole antenna system with that focus
          being shifted closer to reflector 8. The bioelectromagnetic
          radiation directed from the first antenna system<br>
          <br>
          [0013] comes to reflector 8 and lens 9 and from them - to
          convex mirror 34. From that point the electromagnetic flow is
          reflected and in the form of a more dense beam is directed to
          the zone of focus of the second antenna S system where
          biological object 5 is located. Thanks to :higher
          concentration the degree of influence during transmitting to
          an object a natural information supply is increased.<br>
          <b><br>
          </b><b>Industrial Applicability </b><br>
          <br>
          The device is easy to manufacture and use, it is recommended
          to use it for maintaining vitality of bodies by way of
          transmitting to them a natural information supply from live
          sources.<br>
