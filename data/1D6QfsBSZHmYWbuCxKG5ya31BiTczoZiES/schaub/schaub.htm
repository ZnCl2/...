        <p><b><font size="+1">Construction for Creating Wild Brooks
              &amp; Flow Regulation</font></b> </p>
        <p>by <br>
          <b>Viktor Schauberger</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The invention corresponds to a construction for creating wild
        brooks and flow-regulation through the speed of water that is
        dammed, so that with oriented stones no destruction may come
        along the course of the waterpath through the damming
        constructs, and to place the central line of the watercourse in
        the middle of the stream. </p>
      <p>The invention is illustrated in the drawings; <b>Figure 1</b>
        is an example of water-conduction and damming in the shape of
        transversely-placed dams. </p>
      <p>The dams (1) are hollow and made of concrete placed and
        anchored to the ground with suitable anchors (2), so that they
        cannot be displaced by the streaming water. The striations are
        placed against the direction of the waterflow, upon which the
        water runs and along which it will sluice; through this coursing
        the water loses the greatest portion of its energy and does not
        strike too hard against the placed dams, forcing them out of
        place. </p>
      <p>The dams can be placed at far or close distances from each
        other in the course of the constructed brook. In order to lay
        the theoretical middle of the stream in the midst of the flow in
        far-off places and also to prevent the destruction of the river
        shore through erosion, we will place constructions by the sides
        of the flow that will act as dams as seen in <b>Figure 2</b>.
        In this figure the dams are indicated by (3), while the stones
        are placed at (4) in opposite places. The middle line of the
        waterflow (5) runs through them as illustrated. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> shows in greater detail one of such constructs
        and Figure 4 a transverse cut through one of them. </p>
      <p>The constructions (3) are essentially triangular-shaped, and
        are jammed into the soil against the shore so as to elevate and
        make the water flow towards a middle point. </p>
      <p>The effect made by these constructions is further illustrated
        in <b>Figure 4</b>, where the dashed line (6)-(6) in the
        transversal cut of the ground before the construction, which
        obliges the ground to place itself along the dashed line because
        of the disturbed waterflow. </p>
      <p>The oriented stones are placed between the constructions (3)
        and this builds a zone of still water close to them, next to the
        shore, and also serves the purpose of directing the waterflow
        and to protect the shores from erosion through water (<b>Figure
          3</b>). The full line (5) indicates the middle of the stream
        in the corresponding construction, while dashed line (5)
        indicates the middle line in the brook under the influence of
        the constructs. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Artificial Channel for Transporting Logs</font></b>
        </p>
        <p>by <b>Viktor Schauberger</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The transportation of logs and other varied loads through water
        channels and other artificial channels, though its low cost
        makes it competitive against other transportation means, suffers
        under the condition that when moving along the water flow some
        logs, especially in curves, tend to remain stuck and in this way
        sop the following logs, diminishing the general speed of the
        transport. This is especially true for hard and dense woods that
        remain at the bottom of the channel and move forward very badly.
      </p>
      <p>It is known that the speed displayed by logs in water channels
        is greater than that of the waterspeed; at those places the
        speed of the logs greatly surpasses that of the transporting
        medium and it is seen from <b>Figure 1</b> that the floating
        log creates a frontal wave (0) as it moves. </p>
      <p>While lighter wood (<b>Figure 2</b>) floats without problems,
        heavier wood sits at the bottom of the channel (<b>Figure 3</b>)
        and remains stuck; therefore the water impulse in channels is
        not enough to produce the usual motion through sliding without
        external water spillage. </p>
      <p>The invention pertains to a discovery that corrects these
        evils, namely the elimination of water spillage through the
        implanting of wedges made of wood and the transportation of hard
        and dense woods through sliding in the channels. </p>
      <p>The speed of the water depends overall also on its sliding over
        the channel walls; in the usual slanted channels, this important
        factor is eliminated because of their construction. </p>
      <p>The channels cross-section is not semi-circular or straight,
        but rather, as seen in <b>Figures 2, 3 </b>and<b> 4</b>,
        semicircular (B) with an added semicircular bottom (U) which
        radius is half that of the upper portion (B), so that along the
        line (E)-(F) in <b>Figures 2</b> and <b>3</b>, a resting
        portion (L) can be included; the internal wall at the upper
        semicircular portion is of striated material (unretouched
        cement, directionally nailed wood, etc.), and the underlying
        portion (U) of a sliding material (flattened cement, polished
        wood, etc.), so that the water speed in the lower region (U) is
        much greater than in the upper part (B). </p>
      <p>This causes at once the sinking of water in the middle of the
        stream (<b>Figure 4</b>); in practice, when a weight falls a
        certain distance, the water striking against the striated
        channel walls moves further, maintaining the mass (H) in the
        midst of the flowing medium by means of the polished underzone
        (U) that displaces the water faster. </p>
      <p>When transporting floating light woods (<b>Figure 2</b>), this
        will not cause any disorder in the flow of water, for the
        underzone (U) will run faster than the upper zone (B); in this
        manner it will not be necessary to build dams outside the
        channel to contain the spilled water. </p>
      <p>From light woods we expect little problem, but with hard and
        dense wood we must expect it to sink deeper and to advance with
        difficulty, so that this kind of wood will sink itself into the
        faster-running underzone (U), and advance in this fashion as if
        advanced by a transporting band. </p>
      <p>When transporting hard and dense woods (<b>Figure 3</b>),
        different laws come into play; the wholly submerged log (H) is
        entirely in the faster-running water, so that the pressure upon
        (E) and (F) of the submerged sliding skids (L) makes them enter
        into action, for this time the usual impulse of water is not
        enough to make the log (H) advance. If these means are not added
        the logs must remain stuck in the bottom of the channel. </p>
      <p>In opposition to the present (1931) transportation of hard wood
        through channels built with hardened materials, the dense and
        hard wood will be transported by doubly-concave channels with
        wall built with lighter materials, for they are not obliged to
        withstand such heavy loads. In curves, where the moving wood is
        obliged to follow them we can, through the proper construction (<b>Figure








          5</b>) of the channel, with only a one-sided channel wall,
        make the log move towards the outside where it will be held by
        the running water along the curve; if need be, we can add
        sliding skids (L) as seen, which can be improved by the addition
        of wheels. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Conduction of Water in Tubes &amp;
              Channels</font></b> </p>
        <p>by <b>Viktor Schauberger</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to the concentration of flowing water
        within polished conduits (pipes), channels and tubes, so as to
        increase the amount of flowing medium passing through them. </p>
      <p>The inventor has discovered that when a certain kind of
        turbulence happens in flowing water, then a temperature
        difference takes place within it, producing also a difference in
        the water speed, and that this happens especially in Waltz-like
        flows. </p>
      <p>It is known that to hinder sedimentation, water channels and
        tubes are built of circular cross-section, so that the flowing
        medium may drag with itself any sediments left; this is to
        provoke a screw-like movement of water so that it may attract
        all particles in its path. </p>
      <p>This invention pertains to a further development of this
        principle, to drag sedimented masses with moving water. </p>
      <p>The main idea of this invention is seen in <b>Figure 2</b>,
        where the usual path of flowing water (4) is detoured by a
        wedge-shaped device into a different way (5). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 5</b> shows an improvement of this idea by adding
        striations (6) to the wedge placed on the inner wall of a
        channel or tube. </p>
      <p>In <b>Figure 1</b>, we see the wedges grouped (2)-(2)-(2") in
        groupings of three, and producing as a result the screw-like
        flow (3)-(3)-(3") through the internal portion of the conduit
        (1). </p>
      <p>This makes the waterflow concentrate at the center of the tube,
        with a concentrical motion, dragging along any particles left
        upon the walls. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> also shows, in a lateral view, how the normal
        water path (4) is changed to a concentrical one (5), to generate
        a concentrical flow in the flowing medium. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4</b> shows how open semi-circular channels can also
        be adapted to the same purpose. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Installation &amp; Correction of Flow in
              Draining Channels by a Contention &amp; Stabilization of
              Dammed Water</font></b> </p>
        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Viktor Schauberger</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention pertains to an installation related to the
        conduction and regulation of flwo in water channels by
        contention and stabilization in higher levels by means of dams
        integrated into them that depend on the outer temperature of
        flowing water and mixing at will of light and hard water
        conducted out of the basin by its own means, with which it is
        convenient to direct the outer-flowing hard water for cooling
        the layers of lateral walls of the dam of the basin, as will be
        shown herein. </p>
      <p>It is known that for the management of water channels in all
        channel-building techniques that a weighty argument, such as
        water temperature in earth vessels and air temperature as the
        temperature difference between still and running water, is
        always left out; and it is also known that the temperature
        differences between two or more watercourse modifies their speed
        when they mix. </p>
      <p>So far, only through artificial constructs in dams, the
        naturally-built water channels running underground or only
        through ramparts (where only hard water with a temperature close
        to +4 degrees C. comes out), or by means of aquaducts placed
        atop dams (through which channels of only light water of high
        temperature flows), find obstacles in their coursing through the
        channel and cause erosion in their shores. </p>
      <p>However, through a channel can also flow those waters with the
        corresponding right temperature, so that they can be directed to
        damming the water masses and to diminish their forward-going
        impulse or to increase their speed and their forward-going
        impulse in the willed direction. We can also affect works of
        shore-correction just by correct regulation of water temperature
        and also through the emplacement of dams which capacity of
        endurance is directly proportional to the amount of water dammed
        and also to achieve an obstacle-free flow of water. The widening
        of the channel through the emplacement of stones or elimination
        of same (ballast banks) and the elevation of the shore,
        especially in curves, can be made by the corresponding
        directing, but usually provokes a counterflow that erodes the
        whole work. Through several devices that will be explained here,
        it is possible to steer both light and hard waters,
        corresponding to the temperatures of each and also to the
        related fall of temperature, so that by means herein explained
        each water will run along its own level. </p>
      <p>At the same time with the regulation of the waterflow, it is
        necessary to install in the construction of the closing dam of
        the basin, pipes that will effect the cooling of the dams pores
        through the sides of the dam by means of small watercourses
        directed through the materials. </p>
      <p>Then as temperature diminishes, the water within the dams pres
        loses its attraction for dissolving salt and other stuffs, until
        it reaches its balance point at +4 degrees C, at which its
        capacity for dissolving is the least and the filtration in the
        dams wall is the strongest. So far, it is then when the light
        water infiltrated in the wall for cooling will go inside the
        materials through the pores; in this moment, the channel walls
        close to the dam are filled with hard water at a temperature of
        +4 degrees C, which lose their salts into the neighboring ground
        as they move, creating in a few weeks of impregnation a further
        barrier against erosion, and if frost comes, it will also
        contribute to the strengthening of the walls </p>
      <p>In the drawings we find a further explanation of a device for
        this kind of installation; it is seen in transverse cut in <b>Figure








          1</b> and in upper view in <b>Figure 2</b>; at <b>Figure 3</b>
        we see an internal cutaway view of the apparatus for steering
        water. </p>
      <p>For the sake of regulating the flow of cold hard water and warm
        light water, ground nozzles (O) are placed in the dam chamber
        (K) of basin (B) on both sides of the dam, which doors are
        activated through a floating device (G) that moves because of
        temperature differences. The pipes (W) of the nozzle (O) lead up
        to the upper-placed potion (K1) where the flow conduits
        (U1)-(U2)-(U3), which are closed through gravity-activated
        valves (V1)-(V2), branch in different heights from the
        upper-going pipe (W), and that lead further into the lateral
        wall of the basin, spreading out there into the corresponding
        casts. At the foot of the dams internal wall will be
        conveniently placed the outstanding portion (K2) to produce a
        whirling and better mixing of the water masses flowing over the
        wall. The door (T) in the nozzle (O) cleaves the soil of the
        water channel, sinking itself into it, and is connected
        vertically by means of a shaft (F), coursing inside the dams
        wall (H), with the floating device (G) that is built as a
        submersible bell. In the illustrated wall (H), we find at
        different heights over the ground-nozzle (O) tube-shaped outlets
        (A) that communicate with the tube leading upwards to the bell
        (G) and allow the automatic emptying of the water basin. </p>
      <p>When the pipe (W) is allowed to fill through the opening of
        door (T), it will allow a communication between the pipe and the
        basin that will release pressure from door (T) unilaterally, and
        in this fashion allow its free motion upwards. The door (T)
        should be built of wood to allow the free motion of the bell (G)
        when the right water level is attained. The floating bell (G),
        which connecting shaft (F) goes downward, can in this fashion,
        and because of the only motion it is allowed to make, float
        upwards; the bell (G) in Figure 3 has an air valve (P) through
        which opening can be introduced pressurized air within, so that
        the door (T) will be activated at once. Through both an open end
        and with the outstanding tube (R), we can create a flow of water
        through the floating up or down of the bell. </p>
      <p>When the diving bell is fully sunk, without any air margin, it
        acts to totally close the valve; and when we inject air within
        it, then raises to allow the opening of door (T). </p>
      <p>In normal work, the atmosphere imprisoned within the bell (G)
        is equal to the usual atmospheric pressure and thus the outer
        temperature of the environment acts as a control; depending on
        the imprisoned air volume within (G), the outer temperature will
        make it raise or descend, allowing the steering of door (T)
        upwards, so that the mass of hard water that will be conducted
        through the nozzle (O), the pipe (W) and the flow tubes
        (U1)-(U2)-(U3), will depend on the changes of outer temperature;
        the light water flows over its own flowing plate placed atop the
        dams crown in the basin. </p>
      <p>The interpenetration of light and hard waters can be improved
        through the construct (K2) placed at the foot of the dams inner
        wall, and also because of the fact that hard water falls
        vertically while light water does so spirally through flow tubes
        (U1)-(U2)-(U3), so that during their fall they will combine. </p>
      <p>Through heating from the suns rays, the diving bell (G) will
        further raise the door (T), and through the channel a greater
        percentage of hard water will be eliminated with respect to the
        light water that flows over the dams top, and instead with
        cooler external temperatures the door (T) will remain either
        totally or almost totally closed and the channel will only
        conduct warm overflowing liquid. </p>
      <p>For a better mixing of light and hard water flowing over the
        dams top, I have placed the flow tube (U2) in the lower part of
        the dams wall (K), so that it or (T) will prevent the water
        from overflowing the basins level. </p>
      <p>The water flowing within the dams lateral walls contributes to
        further cooling them and also to leave deposited salts and other
        stuffs that it loses when reaching a temperature of +4 degrees
        C. </p>
      <p>By opening the flow tube (U3) atop the dams wall, the upper
        portion of the dam can be affected as indicated in the former
        paragraph; the welfare of the dams wall (in all its portions)
        needs this process of impregnation so that its pores are closed
        and no filtration may happen. </p>
      <p>The upper plate (M) serves to allow the overflowing of light
        water and to separate the hard water flowing through the conduit
        (U3), thus helping to further its endurance. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Construction for Fabricating Tap Water

        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Viktor Schauberger</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>It is known that, to fabricate mineral water through devices,
        without any unhygienic condition in the pipes or through the
        mixing of salts and compressed gases under pressure of at least
        2-3 atmospheres, this is usually made under an even higher
        pressure. </p>
      <p>It is also known that to generate soda water the water will be
        mechanically made to flow through carbonic acid under a pressure
        of 12 atmospheres, so that the corresponding enrichment in the
        forementioned cells make the water "active". In other
        procedures, this is done through "cracking". </p>
      <p>The creation of artificial mineral water will also include
        carbonic acid under more or less great pressure of at least 1
        atmosphere, so that the salts will mix evenly, as is done in
        several kinds of mineral water; and in other kinds of waters
        there is a slight dissolution of carbonates (for example, sodium
        bicarbonate) that also include carbonic acid, obtaining from
        this a prickling taste. In the forementioned procedures it is
        necessary, for producing a good mineral water, that the
        ingredients not be in free form but in combination and in
        relation so that the final product be as similar as possible to
        natural spring water. </p>
      <p>As shown in the <b>Figure 1</b>, sterilized water flows
        through cold mercury light in tube (M) and mixes with the
        diluted salts coming from (1). In container (C) the mentioned
        salts are diluted in water and well mixed by revolving fan (G).
        The mixture and kinds of salts direct themselves naturally
        through the sterile water outlet, and do so with different and
        permanent degrees of hardness. </p>
      <p>On the other side, so that the concentration is not too high,
        the artificially generated mineral waters hardness must not
        exceed factor 12 so that industry may not be hindered by it;
        anyway, outgoing water needs for every 10 liters output 1 liter
        of diluted salts in the following constituency and proportions:
      </p>
      <p>Sodium Chloride (NaCl), 0.02 gr <br>
        Magnesium Sulphate (MgSO4), 0.02 gr <br>
        Sodium Biphosphate (NaPh2), 0.02 gr <br>
        Potassium Nitrate (KNO3), 0.008 gr <br>
        Calcium Oxide (CaO), 0.2 gr </p>
      <p>The kind and proportion of these salts are the results of
        several hundreds of experiments. While the calcium oxide
        dissolves itself in water, on the other hand the calcium hydrate
        is very sensitive to the oxygen in the carbonic acid, and thus
        is affected by it and the mercury light. </p>
      <p>For the sake of regulating the liquid flowing out of the
        container (C), this is inside at a constant pressure of 0.1
        atmosphere = 1 meter of acid water; the concentrated diluted
        salts will fall dropping along the pipe (1) and when mixed with
        the contents from (A) will flow into the apparatus (D) which
        turns them into droplets, where they will jump from the outflow
        holes of pipe (N) towards the walls of the apparatus (D); during
        the process the water already processed through carbonic acid
        will flow outside through the tube (K). </p>
      <p>The droplets of both mixed liquids fall downwards and mix in
        the way as happens in nature, where the droplets of rain first
        lose their salts and diluted gases when hitting the ground. This
        mixed water flows within and through the tulip-glass device (E),
        where it always goes up in the outer tulip glasses and down in
        the inner ones, so that it will pass into the other following
        tulip-glass vessel after it has climbed into the innermost one
        of the former stage and thus continues its flow. The water makes
        a meandering motion to carry on the following indicated goal. </p>
      <p>The gas, especially carbonic acid, collects itself in the upper
        portion of the tulips and will then, through the corresponding
        growing pressure, flow through pneumatic tube (R), in which fine
        nozzles is also injected water for flowing, so that the carbonic
        acid that is not already combined with the water will be later.
        On the axis of this devices stages are placed alternately gold
        and silver foils, isolated form each other; between both metals
        there is an electric potential that creates a reduced ionization
        in the flowing liquid. </p>
      <p>In its further motion, water penetrates into the main mixer
        (F), which is insulated against heat and silvered within, and
        within which is located an upwardly spiraling path which
        direction of winding goes against that of the snail and is made
        out of wire mesh. </p>
      <p>On the spirals surface are orderly placed cooling spirals that
        take the temperature of water from 17 degrees C to 4 degrees C.
        The goal of this temperature fall is to properly combine the
        chemical elements. The absorption of the gases in water will be
        increased by the cooling, and otherwise makes possible the
        combination and enrichment of free carbonic acid of the
        resulting masses without the use of pressure. </p>
      <p>The Ca(HCO3)2 presents a weak exterior combination that the
        enrichment with the forementioned carbonic acid had worked out,
        but the enrichment of Ca(HCO3)2 with carbonic acid is possible
        only through cooling in water and the maintenance of an even
        temperature. </p>
      <p>The temperature of outflowing water must not be over 20 degrees
        C and its final temperature (once it was processed) should not
        be over 4 degrees C; it must also be taken into consideration
        that the speed of flow must not be too fast to allow the proper
        mixing of liquids; after leaving the container (F), the liquid
        is made to flow through gold and silver foils until it reaches
        vessel (I), which is divided into chambers (G) and (H). </p>
      <p>First, the water that overflows from (G) falls into chamber
        (H), and so on out of the device (Z). </p>
      <p>By the treatment of water as indicated, many reactions are
        produced; first of all, the water is made wholly drinkable. It
        is also necessary to eliminate any possible exposure to light
        during the process, for light falling on the treated liquids
        produces a loss of quality in the final results. </p>

      <p>It resulted from numerous experiments that a better plowing of
        the soil can be achieved with copper-covered plows instead of
        using plows made of iron or steel. This difference becomes
        stronger when one notices that the speed of plowing becomes
        faster and that the friction between the ground and the
        corresponding portion of the plow is greater. </p>
      <p>This effect of greater speed produces the slow disintegration
        of the copper cover, and the minute copper particles deposited
        in the soil produces a catalytic effect that in turn generates
        better water retention in the ground and also a further increase
        in the quality of plowing. </p>
      <p>These findings were made when passing a plow which body was
        either covered or entirely made of copper. </p>
      <p>But as the building in whole of the plow with copper is
        disadvantageous, it will be convenient to cover those portions
        with copper layers in hardened condition, which can be made
        through several different methods. The deposit of copper
        particles under the ground does not break the magnetic
        permeability of the soil, as does iron or steel. </p>
      <p>Two embodiments are shown in the illustrations. <b>Figures 1</b>
        and <b>2</b> show a lateral view and <b>Figures 3</b> and <b>5</b>
        show a&nbsp; transverse cut, a longitudinal cut, and one plowing
        protrusion. </p>
      <p>In <b>Figures 1</b> and <b>2</b> is illustrated a plow with
        point (1) made of steel as usual, but it can also be covered
        with the corresponding copper cover; this portion cuts through
        the ground, generating friction in the process; another is in
        the smaller portion (2), upon which upper portion there is
        usually a small heap of sol because of pressure when the plow
        moves forward. It will be furnished with an endtail (3), also
        made of copper, that will create a "screwing" motion in the soil
        by means of sunk "screw" (4) located at portion (2). In order to
        make the whole of this latter portion hard enough, it must be
        hammered during construction. </p>
      <p>The plowing protrusion (5), corresponding to <b>Figure 3</b>
        to <b>5</b>, is made with a backward open sheet (6) of copper;
        to fasten upon the protrusion the usual arrow, we use lock (7)
        of protrusion (5) placed at a high location and which is
        furnished with the corresponding key; here it is also convenient
        to place the copper cover by hammering upon the protrusion. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Tubing for Flowing &amp; Gaseous Media</font></b>
        </p>
        <p>by </p>
        <p><b>Viktor Schauberger</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Already there are many propositions for the conduction of fluid
        or gaseous media so as to eliminate losses in pressure or speed
        of motion. Thus it is to prevent the formation of air vesicles
        that it is suggested an increase in resistance to flow as in
        British Patent #409,528, wherein is described a tubing that has
        spirals engraved within and which area in transverse section
        will be limited by two segments of circle arcs. </p>
      <p>From the British Patent #28,543 (1913) comes a tube which
        transverse section is egg-shaped, which is furnished with
        guiding means to prevent the formation of water whirls. In the
        US Patent #1,655,197, as in the Swiss Patent #126,637, are
        indicated either conical or cylindrical tubes for the sake of
        limiting the sedimentation where the tube serves as axis for the
        dragging of sediments; this is further explained in Austrian
        Patent #28,099 exhibiting indented piping. </p>
      <p>This invention pertains to a tube for flowing and gaseous media
        to prevent the formation of incrustations and to hinder the loss
        of flow speed, which cross-section is made out of several circle
        arcs, being the tube wound helically and having its
        cross-section an egg-shape with an indentation (<b>Figure 1</b>),








        and helically wound (<b>Figures 2-4</b>) around different forms.
      </p>
      <p>With the aid of such tubing, the reduction in friction losses
        and the hindrance of incrustations within the pipe will follow;
        for the sake of increasing the former properties it is
        convenient to wrap the tubing and its cover around circular
        conduits. This axis of winding will also serve as axis for
        dragging along sedimentary materials, and will also contribute
        to reduce in scale the cross-section of the tube for winding. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> shows the cross-section of the proposed tubing,
        and <b>Figures 2-4</b> the different ways of winding the
        conduit. </p>
      <p>In <b>Figure 1</b> is shown the employed egg-shape with an
        indentation close to the (---) line; the winding of the conduit
        can be made as shown in <b>Figures 2-4</b> around an imaginary
        solid or in the form of a circular spiral, or in any other
        convenient way. </p>
      <p>In the winding or in its cover, in <b>Figures 3</b> and <b>4</b>,
        we can scale the shape of the winding to make it turn around
        those imaginary bodies or in a straight line. One can also
        arrange the tubing, in relation to the fluids conducted, to make
        the axis of winding equal to the one of dragging sedimentary
        materials to reduce incrustations and losses in flow speed. </p>

      <p>The object of the invention is a hydro-electric device, which
        exploits the kinetic energy of a water jet for the purposes of
        generating electricity. </p>
      <p>The invention is characterised by a cone-shaped rotor, whose
        apex points towards the outlet opening, and rotates about an
        axis common to both rotor and water jet. The outer face of the
        cone is formed of upward-facing, concave, corkscrew-like blades.
        In this way the water-jet is split up and deflected from its
        path and imparts its full force to the rotor, so that, with the
        appropriate proportions between the height of the cone and the
        width of its base, and a suitable pitch of the blades, the size
        of which is dependent on the velocity of the impacting
        water-jet, the water flows from the machine quietly without
        creating spray. </p>
      <p>An example of the arrangement of the invention is schematically
        depicted in the diagram. </p>
      <p>The rotor, whose axle 1 is parallel and common to the axis of
        the jet exiting from the jet-pipe 2, is formed of corkscrew-like
        blades 3. The ends 4 of the blades 3 are curved upwards slightly
        towards the impacting water-jet so as to deflect the jet and to
        effect the greatest possible transfer of its kinetic energy to
        the rotor. In the jet-pipe 2 screw-like ribs 5 are incorporated,
        which, according to observations, increase the velocity of the
        exiting water-jet and the efficiency of the device. </p>
      <p><b>Claims:</b> </p>
      <p>1. The jet-turbine is characterised by a cone-shaped rotor
        positioned in the axis of the water-jet, by means of which the
        water-jet is split up. Corkscrew-like blades <br>
        (5) are incorporated around the cone's periphery (7). </p>
      <p>2. In accordance with Claim 1, the jetturbine is further
        characterised by a jetpipe (2) incorporating rifling ribs (5),
        which impart a spin to the rotor in the direction of its
        rotation. </p>

      <p>This invention relates to a process for the conveyance of media
        in a liquid, vaporous, gaseous or aeriform state and which can
        be described, for example, as emulsions or suspensions, etc.
        Moreover, it also relates to the equipment required to carry out
        such processes. The invention also concerns processes for
        controlling molecular separation or reduction, transformation
        and synthesis with or in the media moved in accordance with the
        invention. It further relates to the procedures for achieving
        increases in mechanical efficiency and output as well as
        equipment for the carrying out of such processes. </p>
      <p>Pursuant to the invention itself, it is essential that the
        media to be conveyed are imparted a movement which conducts them
        inward towards the centre, in the course of which the media are
        conveyed through grooves, pipes, etc. By means of such laminar,
        inwinding, and especially a multiple inwinding motion,
        significant advantages can be achieved in comparison with the
        methods of conveying such media in use today. This occurs
        through the transport of the media in channels, grooves,
        fluting, pipes or vessels with a cross-section in the form of an
        egg, or more accurately part of an egg, having a curved
        indentation, which is twisted like a screw in the direction of
        flow. If pipes are used, then these should take the form of the
        longitudinal cross-section of an egg, but with a curved
        indentation incorporated on one side at the more pointed end and
        which encompasses a quarter or less of the total circumference.
        In open conduits, the cross-section corresponds to a portion of
        such an indented egg-section. Under the term 'egg-shape' is to
        be <br>
        understood the classical egg-shape or an approximative
        egg-shape. The imparting of an inwinding motion can also be
        induced through conduction along appropriately shaped surfaces.
      </p>
      <p>The conduits, pipes and vessels as well as the guiding surfaces
        can have a straight axis, although a meandering or screw-form
        axis is preferable. Through the combined orbital and rotational
        motion thus imparted, the conveyance of the media is facilitated
        and improved, and in this way a series&nbsp; of specific effects
        are achieved. Thus it was, that Professor Dr. Ing. habil. Franz
        Popel of the Institute of Hygiene at Stuttgart Technical
        University was able to establish through comparative
        experiments, that in an indented or fluted, egg-shaped profile,
        wherein the indentation is twisted like a screw in the direction
        of flow, the level of friction did not increase with increased
        volume and velocity of flow. On the contrary, at certain
        velocities the friction diminished and overall it was
        significantly less than in conventional pipes of circular
        profile. </p>
      <p>In liquids conveyed by this invention, the frictional
        resistance of the liquids on the inner wall-surfaces of the
        conducting pipe is reduced to a remarkable degree. It has also
        become evident that any variety of copper enhances or
        facilitates the inwinding motion catalytically. Instead of being
        wholly made out of copper, copper facings can also be used,
        which are affixed to the inside of the pipe. The desired results
        are achieved simply because the liquid comes in contact with the
        copper from time to time, the more frequently the better. Alloys
        of copper can also be used to equal advantage. Instead of
        copper, other metals belonging to the same electromotive series
        can be used, such as silver or gold. </p>
      <p>The best effect corresponding to the intent of the invention,
        is achieved with the use of doubly twisted pipes. These are
        pipes in which the indented, eggshaped, <br>
        cross-section is first twisted along the length of the pipe and
        the whole then wound into a coil. </p>
      <p>Apart from this, the desired effect can also be intensified by
        the application of magnets. These are either laid continuously
        or spaced at certain intervals along the length of the pipe. </p>
      <p>To date it has not been known that it is possible to move
        liquid, gaseous or aeriform media in such a way that molecular
        activity can be controlled at will. With today's conventional
        systems of movement, e.g. in straight-drawn, smooth pipes, the
        through-flowing media will indeed be transported. However, a
        reactive, structure-loosening tendency evolves as a secondary
        effect, which provokes further molecular disintegration. This
        cannot be controlled. These disintegrative events increase quite
        considerably with an increase in velocity caused by increased
        pressure, additional warming or mechanical centrifugating, etc.
      </p>
      <p>If the molecular structure of a moving liquid, gaseous or
        aeriform medium is to be maintained or a process of molecular
        synthesis actually inaugurated, then the aforesaid
        structure-loosening tendency must be prevented as a first
        priority. </p>
      <p>The aim of the invention includes processes and appliances,
        which not only prevent unwanted molecular disintegration and the
        de-energising of the moving liquid and gaseous media, but also
        enable the achievement of molecular synthesis and a build-up of
        energy. These also lead to increases in mechanical efficiency
        and output. </p>
      <p>In certain cases these molecular processes have to take place
        in a certain, special, rhythmical interplay of forces, in which
        expansion and contraction alternate with each other. By
        preventing molecular disintegration or separation, a condition
        can be achieved in which encrustations and sedimentation in the
        moving water or other liquid can be eliminated. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the invention, the desired effect is
        achieved through a particular process, as a result of which the
        medium is primarily imparted a definite laminar,
        multiple-inwinding motion. It is the special construction of
        these pipes, conduits or vessels that makes this form of motion
        possible. The molecular synthesis, recombination and
        transformation, energetic upgrading, bio-catalytic reduction,
        etc. is achieved with the processes associated with this
        invention: </p>
      <p>(a) through the laminar, multiple inwinding of the media to be
        moved in these involution enhancing forms, fabricated with
        certain materials, and if necessary, </p>
      <p>(b) through the addition of substances of diverse molecular and
        atomic structure or if need be, of trace-elements, active
        substances and the like, and </p>
      <p>(c) through the energetic bonding (coupling) of the media and
        the added material by means of catalysts. This can also be
        effected by directly or indirectly incident rays of light of
        different frequencies, e.g. blue, ultraviolet light, etc. The
        stimulation of pulsation or vibration by means of ultra-sound is
        also possible. Excessive structure-loosening influences of light
        of certain frequency bands must be reduced to the minimum value
        prescribed for each medium. </p>
      <p>By way of example, the design of a conduit producing a
        multiple-inwinding flow-motion, which at least maintains the
        molecular structure of media to be moved, is to be provided with
        an 'open profile' and must exhibit the following features: </p>
      <p>(a) it must have a variable cross-sectional profile, which is
        envisaged as having been derived from the pointed end of an
        egg-shaped form, whereby in one of its longitudinal halves the
        near-identical profile is incorporated as a concavity. (Fig. 1)
      </p>
      <p>(b) It must have a longitudinal profile that is so shaped as to
        take the form of a wave, or meander, as shown in Figure 2a. </p>
      <p>The form of the conduit itself must be so constructed that
        along the length of the meandering longitudinal profile the
        convex portion of the 1/2 egg-shaped profile migrates from the
        right-hand of Section A-A1, via the neutral point of Section
        B-B1, rising to its extreme value again on the left-hand side of
        Section C-C1. In this process of migration the size of the
        indentation gradually reduces and displaces laterally. </p>
      <p>In natural channels (streams, rivers, etc.) the previously
        described channel shape is the prerequisite for inwinding
        motion. Natural channels are therefore the prerequisite for the
        regeneration of the watercourse and for the maintenance of the
        biological laws of bio-hydraulics. </p>
      <p>If the previously described, partial egg-profile containing the
        convex indentation is supplemented by fully rounded,
        longitudinal portion on the opposite side, then the
        cross-sectional form of the 'closed profile' is produced (Figure
        3 ). </p>
      <p>In Figure 4, by way of example, an arrangement is depicted in
        which a pipe with a closed profile is wound around the outer
        face of an imaginary cylinder. This design can be usefully
        applied, for example, to drinking water pipelines, the
        reticulation of industrial water and for pipelines of all kinds.
      </p>
      <p>If in addition an acceleration of the flow is desired, i.e. for
        purposes of reducing the cross-sectional area and the resultant
        savings in costs of the pipes themselves, then these specially
        profiled, closed pipes, either singly or severally, can be wound
        around and attached to a cylindrical core (Figure 4), which is
        then made to rotate. The volume conveyed and the increase in
        mechanical efficiency and output can be regulated by varying the
        rate of rotation. This arrangement is particularly suited to the
        conveyance of liquid, gaseous and aeriform media. </p>
      <p>A further example of the design, which serves for certain
        syntheses (transformative, recombinant and upgrading processes),
        is depicted in Figure 5a, 5b, In these configurations the closed
        profile shown in Figure 3 can also be used. In this design a
        pipe possessing the said profile is wound around a conical,
        rotating core. </p>
      <p>Depending on the desired purpose, the cross-sectional profile
        either reduces in size towards the point of the cone (Figure
        5b), for example, for the conveyance and transformation of
        seawater into freshwater, or towards the base of the cone-shaped
        core (Figure 5a), for example, for the separation of mixtures.
        For particular applications, several such pipes can be connected
        top to top, or bottom to bottom (for example, in the stimulation
        of pulsations for processes of synthesis). </p>
      <p>Likewise several such twisted pipes can be grouped about a
        common axis. Open, slotted, perforated or partially open and
        closed pipes and pipe systems of the above type can also be
        used, for example, to achieve diffusive or filtering effects. </p>
      <p>With the possibility of regulating the rotational velocity of
        such pipes or pipelines, not only can the discharge velocity of
        the media be increased and with it an increase in mechanical
        efficiency and output, but also the speed of the molecular
        transformation can be controlled. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, with a non-rotating pipe configuration of
        similar nature, the process of molecular transformation takes
        place over a correspondingly longer pathway. </p>
      <p>Experiments have shown that a particularly useful shape of
        vessel can be developed from the egg-shape and is especially
        suited to the mixing, stirring, etc., of media, or the carrying
        out of biochemical processes and fermentation processes. This
        shape can also be developed from rotating egg-shaped or ovoid
        bodies or if necessary from paraboloid or hyperboloid, rotating
        bodies and the like, whereby these vessels can likewise be set
        in regulable rotation as the case demands. </p>
      <p>The driving mechanism for all these rotating bodies can also be
        designed in such a way, that these bodies are imparted a
        rhythmically alternating direction of rotation. Drives of this
        nature require no further elaboration here, since they are
        already well-known to technology. </p>
      <p>The inclusion of additives can take place in any desired
        fashion and relates to substances in a solid, liquid, gaseous or
        aeriform state, and is ordered according to the nature of the
        desired molecular synthesis or organisation. The intrinsic
        qualities of the material required to upgrade the water must be
        introduced in doses in accordance with the findings of the
        analyses of the said drinking, medicinal and /or mineral water.
      </p>
      <p>The energetic coupling, the actual bonding of these additives
        to the media, is achieved through the interaction between the
        aforesaid types of motion. The bonding takes place by way of
        bio-catalysts inter alia through the appropriate choice of
        materials from which the previously described pipes, channels or
        vessels are made. In such applications, copper, silver and gold
        and their alloys have proved to be particularly suitable.
        However, synthetic resins (plastics) with or without mineral or
        metallic inclusions or crystals, or natural stone, woods such as
        larch, fir, etc. and combinations of such materials can also be
        used. </p>
      <p>For example, in a vessel made with an appropriate copper alloy,
        water with a corresponding valency (healing property) can be
        produced. </p>
      <p>... [Missing text ] have a specific, energetic proportional
        relation, which in any event is sufficiently well understood in
        the field of catalysts and their application. </p>
      <p>In addition, the energetic coupling (bonding) can take place
        through direct irradiation by light of various frequencies
        (blue, ultra-violet, etc.) or through the mechanical stimulation
        of vibration, as has already been stated. </p>
      <p>The distinctive, multiple-inwinding motion, characterised above
        by the orbital and rotational, inwinding tendency of the moving
        medium (water, earth, air, etc.) leads to a drop in temperature
        towards the anomaly point of +4°C (39.2°F) and its specific
        densation, which is the case with water in particular. </p>
      <p>These effects are integral to the possibility of controlling
        the induced molecular processes and to the achievement of a
        substantially higher output and performance. They can be applied
        to drive turbines, propel ships, locomotive devices, aircraft,
        the conveyance of all kinds of media, to the raising of the
        carrying capacity and tractive force of the water in small,
        artificial channels, conduits or flumes, etc. </p>
      <p>The increase in performance itself is to be attributed inter
        alia to the substantial elimination of the centrifugally-acting,
        reactive wall-pressures. In all systems of motion of this
        nature, the speed of motion is increased. The process of
        molecular syntheses is strengthened through the increase in
        specific density. In the case of rotating pipes, pipes systems
        and vessels, a regulable reversed flow and/or counter-rotation
        occurs between the rotating forms and the media moving through
        them, which accelerates and augments the aforesaid processes as
        well as the mechanical increase in output and efficiency.
        Accordingly, the areas of application of the invention are
        manifold and of extremely wide scope. The implementation of this
        process and the associated appliances has proved to be
        particularly effective in the prevention of encrustation in
        pipes, sedimentation in channels, the transformation of seawater
        into freshwater with a range of properties, the biological
        purification of polluted drinking water and general purpose
        water, and in high-grade molecular syntheses. It is equally
        suited to processes of energetic concentration and
        transformation, for example, in the transformation of molecular
        structures of liquid nature into gaseous, etheral or volatile
        states and vice versa. It demonstrates the nature of the
        build-up of blood, and sap in the world of plants. </p>
      <p>It should also be mentioned that, as a result of this
        invention, new designs for turbines, propulsion systems for
        ships and aircraft, and differently designed water reticulation
        and transfer installations can be developed. With more specific
        reference to the invention itself, it should also be noted with
        reference to Figure 6, that the movement mentioned above (which
        can equally take place in the opposite direction), and multiple
        inwinding movement in particular, should be conceived as the
        tendencies represented in Figure 6. In this figure, which
        depicts a closed profile, D is the direction in which the
        profile itself rotates and E is the direction of the tendency to
        inwind. As inwinding forms, apart from the inwinding motion
        described above, equal consideration should be given to the
        coiling of the profile shown in Figure 6 about various other
        forms depicted schematically in Figures 4, 5c &amp; 5d. These
        other forms can also include an extended egg-shape (tear-drop
        shape) or a contracted (extreme) egg-shape. </p>
      <p>Amongst the base core-forms mentioned above, inwinding tubes or
        systems of inwinding tubes of a special design can be
        incorporated (as in Figure 7). Curved or inwinding tubes of a
        special shape can likewise be attached to the external envelope
        or the internal periphery of the bodies of the rotating conical
        shapes or the others described above, whose spiral
        configurations rotate in opposite directions, for example, a
        left-hand external spiral and a right-hand internal spiral
        configuration, or vice versa. </p>
      <p><b>Patent Claims</b> </p>
      <p>The invention is characterised notably by the following
        features and possible permutations and combinations: </p>
      <p>1. Procedures for the control of processes of molecular
        decomposition, transformation or composition taking place in the
        moving media, liquid, gaseous or aeriform through which an
        increase in mechanical performance and output can be achieved;
        Procedures characterised by endowing the media with a particular
        laminar movement, which then inwinds upon itself several times
        in the above conduits, tubes or receptacles of a certain shape
        and material conducive to such form of movement. </p>
      <p>2. Given that different media have different molecular and
        atomic structures, these are transformed into molecular
        organisations of different nature through the interactions
        occurring during such laminar multipleinwinding movement by
        means of energetic coupling. </p>
      <p>3. Elements existing as trace-elements, active substances and
        such like are incorporated into the said processes in order to
        contribute or participate in the energetic interactions. </p>
      <p>4. The energetic interaction (coupling) between the media or
        substances is produced, for example, by way of catalysts, which
        amongst other things, desirably correspond to the base material
        of the artefact, or through the direct or indirect production of
        oscillations (for example, light of different frequency regions
        or ultra-sound), the said interaction being additionally
        assisted by the production of mechanical oscillations. <br>

      <p>It is known that impellers can be caused to rotate by moving
        air. It is equally known that an air current can be generated
        through evacuation. The present invention, however, makes use of
        mechanical and physical forces. </p>
      <p>In the accompanying diagram (see fig. 19), the object of the
        invention is portrayed in Sections A-A and B-B. A
        snailshell-shaped housing a in which the impeller b is mounted
        is connected to a double-spiral pipe c by means of a hollow
        shaft d. The double-spiral pipe c is joined to an egg-shaped,
        hollow body e at f, which is divided into two spaces by means of
        a wire mesh g. In the inner chamber of e gas-burners or electric
        arc-throwers are incorporated that combust the inflowing gas at
        about 2,000°C (3,632°F). The inner chamber is connected to an
        exhauster via a heatable double-spiral pipe h. To this
        exhauster, streamlined, egg-shaped nozzles i are attached and
        the whole arrangement is activated by an external force. </p>
      <p>The impeller incorporated inside the snailshell housing is
        constructed in such a way that fresh air can only enter the
        hollow shaft d when the impeller blade k passes over the slot j
        incorporated in the hollow shaft. The flywheel l, whose
        cross-sections are egg-shaped and which is mounted on the hollow
        shaft d, is installed in an externally airtight housing m. The
        air present in the hollow space n is sucked out through a
        connecting passage o, so that in the highly rarefied space n the
        flywheel is offered very little resistance to rotation. To
        maintain the combustion process, a combustible gas is introduced
        at p. The double-spiral pipe c mentioned at the beginning has
        been granted an Austrian patent, No. 138296. This pipe consists
        of an external pipe made of wooden staves and an asbestos
        sleeve. Within the latter there is a metal sleeve, which has
        wood-shaving-like metal elements bent out from the periphery,
        whose axis is inclined towards the pipe-axis at an angle of 30°
        to 45°. [3] [3: consult patent 138296] These metal elements are
        aligned along several spiral pathways. The peripheral air-masses
        will thus be forced to describe a path corresponding to a spiral
        within a spiral. </p>
      <p>The inner metal sleeve is heated electrically. In addition, the
        heat arising from friction on the outer walls leads to the
        warming of the outer air-masses, through which in particular all
        the oxygen contained in the air expands, concentrates itself at
        the pipe-walls, becoming even warmer on its multi-spiral path
        along the pipe-walls. The remaining gases contained in the air
        pass down the centre of the pipe and rise through the agency of
        the gas introduced at p. Because the warmer and therefore more
        aggressive oxygen brushes along the outer pipe-walls and the
        colder residual components of the air flow through the inner
        region of the pipe, inner tensions arise between the materials
        due to the temperature differences obtaining, which become more
        pronounced the longer the distance travelled, until interactions
        ultimately occur. These interactions proceed in the form of
        small explosions and assist the reaction that takes place
        through the combustion of the highly energised gases within the
        egg-shaped safety mesh g. </p>
      <p>In the egg-shaped body e a sieve (safety mesh) g is
        incorporated, outside of which the separated oxygen mentioned
        earlier accumulates, passes through the sieve into the centre,
        wherein, with the aid of the electric or gas arcs, it
        contributes to the almost complete combustion of the centrally
        conducted combustible gases. As a result a much greater vacuum
        evolves than has hitherto been achieved using currently known
        methods. At the same time the exhaust gases are reduced to a
        minimum and extracted mechanically via h and i. Through the
        creation of the vacuum in e, the air will be sucked in with even
        greater force, setting the impeller in motion in the process. </p>
      <p><b>Claims</b> </p>
      <p>1. The air-turbine is characterised by the fact that the
        air-masses in a doublespiral pipe can be so strongly moved, that
        due to frictional heat and externally supplied heat between the
        peripheral air-masses and those streaming down the pipe-axis,
        differences in temperature arise, which lead to cold
        interactions in the air flowing through the double-spiral pipe,
        whose end-product is an almost total vacuum. </p>
      <p>2. In accordance with Claim 1 the air-turbine is further
        characterised by the complete combustion that takes place in a
        partitioned chamber by means of a safety mesh having a
        pipe-shaped extension towards its base. </p>
      <p>3. In accordance with Claims 1 &amp; 2, the air-turbine is
        characterised by the fact that the attached flywheel is caused
        to rotate in a rarefied space. </p>
      <p>4. In accordance with Claims 1-3, the air-turbine is
        characterised by the fact that the supply of air takes place
        pulsatingly through a slot in the hollow shaft. </p>
      <p>5. In accordance with Claims 1-3, the air-turbine is
        characterised by the fact that the discharge of exhaust gases
        takes place by means of a heated pipe in which a temperature
        higher than that of the exhaust gases prevails. </p>

      <p><font color="#000000">This invention relates to methods and
          apparatus for agitating a body of fluids, in particular for
          the purpose of making a mixture, solution, emulsion,
          suspension and the like, from a plurality of fluids or from a
          quantity of material and one or more fluids, or for the
          purpose of incorporating air into the body of fluid.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;In some industrial and chemical
          processes it is often necessary to mix a fluid and another
          material to form a solution, emulsion, suspension or the like.
          Such mixing operations are required for example in the
          preparation of mineral drinks, fluid mixtures containing a
          small amount of a particular substance, mixtures of carbon
          dioxide with a fluid, and also in the purification of bodies
          of water.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">On the latter connection, it has been
          found that the self-purifying capacity of still or relatively
          slowly flowing water is less than that of more rapidly flowing
          water, for example, flowing at 20 centimeters per second. The
          greater self-purifying capacity of rapidly flowing water is
          due to the fact that, owing to turbulence produced in the
          water, oxygen has a greater analysis to be incorporated into
          the water and decompose the organic substances before they
          settle. The relatively rapid flow causes the oxygen consumed
          in the decomposition process to be quickly replaced. In still
          or relatively slowly flowing water, such as lakes or
          reservoirs, however, settling of the organic substances not
          only results in the lower regions of the water becoming
          saturated wit such substances, but in addition, causes an
          oxygen deficit in the upper layers of the water, for the
          reason that oxygen consumed in the decomposition of the
          settling substances is not replaced, owing to the slower flow
          or complete stagnation not producing turbulence to cause
          oxygen from the atmosphere to be incorporated into the water.
          As a result, the organic substances are not consumed by oxygen
          and the water becomes impure or polluted. It is possible to
          overcome such pollution by agitating the water to reduce the
          settlement of organic substances and in particular, to
          increase the amount of oxygen absorbed into the water at its
          surface from the adjacent atmosphere,, so that a greater
          amount of oxygen is available to decompose the organic
          substances and thereby purify the water.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">According to the present invention, there
          is provided apparatus for agitating air into the fluid,
          comprising a vessel to contain the fluid and having an
          upwardly facing opening, and a rotatable shaft extending
          upwardly into the vessel from the bottom thereof and carrying
          at least one stirring blade, the configuration of the vessel
          being such that in a portion adjacent the shaft, the walls of
          the vessel diverge upwardly in a continuous curve from the
          location of the shaft, in the form of an end portion of an

          fifth embodiment of the apparatus, showing a vessel within a
          larger body of fluid.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Referring firstly to Figure 1, the
          embodiment shown comprises a vertically arranged closed
          egg-shaped vessel 1 containing a fluid F to be mixed. The
          larger end of the vessel 1 is disposed upwardly, while the
          configuration of a substantial portion of the body of the
          vessel 1 lying between the larger and smaller ends thereof is
          defined by an exponential function which is represented in
          polar coordinates by the general equations r = a0 and r = a0 +
          b, and in a specific case by the equation r = e0 + b, where r
          is the radius vector, a and b designate any constant, and e is
          the base of the natural logarithm. [phi]</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">At the larger end of the vessel 1, an
          opening 2 is provided on the axis of symmetry of the vessel 1
          for introducing materials M into the body of fluid F. The
          materials to be mixed with the fluid may include air or other
          matter in solid, liquid or gaseous form, Depending on the
          nature of the material to be mixed with the fluid F,
          pressurized injection into the vessel may be required,
          particularly of the material is in the form of a powder or
          small particles.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Located at the lower end of the vessel 1
          and also on its axis of symmetry is a rotatable shaft 3
          carrying at its upper end a single bladed stirring element 4
          for stirring the fluid F and imparting to it a whirling or
          vertical motion, as shown by the arrows of Figure 1. Thus the
          flow of the whirling body of fluid in the vessel 1 comprises
          an upwardly flowing spiral at the outer periphery of the
          whirling body, extending substantially to the surface of fluid
          F. Inside the upwardly flowing spiral there is also a
          vertically upward flow to the surface, which then turns
          inwardly, also mixing with the downward flow resulting from
          the upward spiral. The vortex or whirling action created by
          the stirring element 4 and the walls of the vessel 1 is
          similar to the eddy or whirlpool phenomena occurring in a
          flowing stream of water. The vortex in the fluid F creates a
          lower pressure region along the axis of the vortex, while has
          a suction effect so drawing fluid downwardly at the center and
          also drawing in air from the region adjacent the surface of
          the fluid F. In Figures 1 and 1a, the path followed by an
          individual fluid particle p is shown as it passes in an
          upwardly flowing spiral within the body of Fluid F. Any
          materials introduced into the vessel 1 through the opening 2
          are pulled or sucked into the body of fluid F by its vortex
          action, which also provides a mixing effect.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Referring now to Figure 2, the apparatus
          comprises a vessel 5 of the same general configuration as the
          vessel 1 shown in Figure 1, but which is in an inverted
          position, that is, with its larger end downwards. Located at
          the lower end of the vessel 5 is a rotatable shaft 3 having a
          double-bladed stirring element 4 at its upper end. The
          vessel5 contains a fluid F, the level of which is such as to
          leave a space as shown between the fluid F and the upper end
          of the vessel 5. An inlet pipe 6 opens into the vessels 5 by
          way of an inlet opening 6 such that material is injected
          tangentially into, and below the surface of, the whirling
          volume of fluid F.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Axially arranged in the upper end of the
          vessel 5 is a short tubular member 7 containing a lens or
          filter 8. Aligned above the filter 8 is an irradiation source
          9 for directing radiation, such as ultraviolet rays,
          downwardly through the filter 8 into the fluid F. The
          direction of the rays from the source 9 is along the axis of
          the vortex created in the body o fluid F by the stirring
          element 4.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The shape of the vessel 5 is, as shown,
          similar to that of the vessel in Figure 1, the configuration
          of a substantial portion between the ends of the vessel 1
          being defined by the equations set forth hereinbefore with
          reference to figure 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In both vessels 1 and 5, the stirring
          elements 4, 4 combine with the vessel walls to create a
          vortex in the body of fluid F. I Figure 2, materials to be
          mixed are injected tangentially into the vessel 5 and are
          picked up by the upwardly flowing spiral at the vessel wall,
          which then carries them into the center of the vessel 5 and
          downwardly, so that they become intimately mixed by the vortex
          action. The rays from the source 9, which pass through the
          filter 8, are absorbed into the whirling body of the fluid F
          and, due to the continuous mixing effect, irradiate the fluid
          F and any additional matter it contains.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Figure 3 shows a vessel 10 similar to
          that shown in Figure 2 except that its upper end is open,
          giving it a goblet-like shape. Carried at its lower end, the
          vessel 10 has a rotatable shaft 3 with single-bladed stirring
          element 4 at its upper end for whirling the fluid F. As the
          upper end of the vessel 10 is open, it can be used in various
          processes for the treating and mixing of fluids. Materials to
          be mixed are introduced through the opening in the upper end
          of the vessel 10, while the vessel 10 could be used by itself
          or within a larger tank for mixing a fluid.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Where a vessel is to be positioned within
          a larger tank of fluid to be mixed, or within a natural body
          of water, into which oxygen is to be absorbed to decompose any
          organic matter therein and thereby purify the water, the
          embodiments shown in Figure 4 and 5 are preferred.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In Figure 4, the fluid F is contained
          within a large tank or container 25. Extending upwardly from
          the base of the tank are support members 21 which carry a
          dome-shaped vessel 20 which is of a configuration similar to
          the lower portion of the vessels 5 and 10 shown in Figures 2
          and 3, thus forming an open bowl-type container. Extending
          through the lower end of the vessel 20 is a rotatable shaft 23
          carrying a its upper end a single-bladed stirring element 24
          located in the bottom of the vessel 20. Disposed below the
          vessel 20 is a motor 22 for driving the shaft 23 and is
          stirring element 24. In operation, the stirring element 24
          creates a whirling action within a body of fluid f shown in
          dash-dotted lines in Figure 4. The container 25 may be a
          collecting tank, settling tank, water reservoir or similar
          fluid-holding device in which a mixing action is to be
          produced.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The other embodiment of a mixing vessel
          positioned within a body of fluid F, shown in Figure 5,
          comprises a vessel 30 of a cup-shaped configuration which is
          similar to the lower portion of the vessel 1 shown in Figure
          1. Mounted at the lower end of the vessel 30 is a hollow
          rotatable shaft 33 with a single-bladed stirring element 34
          located at its upper end. Fluid, or any material S, below the
          vessel 30 may also be drawn into the vessel through the hollow
          shaft 33 so that such fluid may be incorporated upwardly into
          the whirling volume of fluid f. Additionally, it should be
          noted that the irradiation source 9 shown in Figure 2 could be
          used in either of the embodiments shown in Figures 4 or 5 to
          provide radiation treatment of the fluid.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In Figures 4 and 5, a vortex or whirling
          movement is produced in the fluid F to be mixed, whether it
          is a natural body of water, such as the water of a lake, or a
          large container holding some other fluid, by the stirring
          elements 24, 34 disposed in the lower portion of vessels, 20,
          30 respectively. The general outline of the body of fluid f to
          which the whirling movement is imparted is shown by the
          dash-dotted line in Figures 4 and 5. Additionally, in Figure
          4, the flow pattern within the body of fluid f is shown by a
          number of solid lines bearing directional arrows. The flow
          pattern is the same as previously described for Figure 1, the
          outer layer of the body of fluid f moving in an upwardly
          flowing spiral to the surface of the fluid. Similarly,
          inwardly of the upwardly spiraling layer is an upwardly
          flowing layer which reverse direction in the upper region of
          the whirling body of fluid f moving in an upward flowing
          spiral to the surface of the fluid. Similarly, inwardly of the
          upwardly spiraling layer is an upwardly flowing layer which
          reverses direction in the upper region of the whirling body of
          fluid f, then passing inwardly and downwardly at S along the
          axis of the vortex. The suction effect developed by the vortex
          produced in the body of fluid f tends to suck in any materials
          to be mixed with the fluid; this suction effect may be used in
          the case of water to draw oxygen into the water to provide a
          biochemical purification action. In both the embodiments shown
          in Figures 4 and 5, as the vessel 20, 30 extends only a short
          distance above the stirring element 24, 34, it does not
          interfere with any mixing at the interface of the main body of
          fluid F and the fluid f in the whirling volume.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In the mixing operation, whether in the
          closed vessels shown in Figures 1 and 2 or in the open vessels
          of Figures 3m 4, and 5, a relatively small amount of energy is
          needed to rotate the stirring elements and create the vortex
          in the fluid. Moreover, where an open vessel is used, as in
          Figures 4 and 5, not only is it possible to produce
          circulation of fluid within the boundaries of the whirling
          body of fluid f, but the fluid F is also drawn into hat
          whirling body so that a complete mixing action can be
          achieved. Additionally, when either the open or closed vessels
          are used, the whirling body of fluid will show resonance
          phenomenon when a relatively high speed stirring element is
          employed; under such conditions the intensity of fluid
          circulation produced by the stirring element can be increased
          by increasing the speed of the elements, with only a
          relatively small additional energy consumption.</font> </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Method and Apparatus for Sorting Timber</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><img src="us1775.jpg" height="398" width="509"></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to an improved method of and arrangement
        for sorting and discharging separated different kinds of timber,
        such as long-tailed timber, log timber, billet wood, etc. </p>
      <p>The simultaneous floating of different kinds of timber,
        presents difficulties, because each kind moves with different
        speed and the slow moving short wood is overtaken by the faster
        floating log-timber, particularly at the curves, and therefore a
        sorting of the timber is carried out at the outlet of the
        retaining basin. </p>
      <p>The method of separating the different kinds of timber is based
        on the fact, that the pieces of wood of different thicknesses
        are submerged in the water to different depth and therefore by
        draining off the topmost water-layer only, at first the smaller
        billet-woods, floating on the surface, are set into motion,
        while the log-timber and long-tailed timber which float deeper
        in the water can float off only in case the overflow is made to
        a greater depth. Thus by a suitable adjustment of an overflow
        door the different kinds of timber are sucked into a short
        channel which preferably is arranged in communication with a
        retaining or collecting basin. Timber, floating at a greater
        depth, is prevented from floating off by occasionally lifting
        the overflow-door, whereby a retaining action arises, which
        stops the start of the undesirable movement. After the discharge
        from the said short channel, a further separation of the
        different kinds of timber is carried out by reason of the fact
        that the small pieces of wood float on the top and in case the
        overflow-door is lowered very slightly only, these small pieces
        are discharged into a wet-chute which lies at a proper depth
        opposite the floor of the channel, while after a further
        lowering of the overflow-door the log-timber is discharged into
        a higher timber cute by reason of the greater speed of the
        water. The short channel is provided with longitudinal ribs, in
        order to prevent a rotation or eddying of the water in this
        part. The outflowing water passes into a discharge pit, which is
        provided with a grate for catching the billet-wood and for
        guiding the latter into the chute. In this manner the
        billet-wood and log-timber pass in a wet condition into the dry
        chute. Whereby the sliding capacity of the wood is increased by
        about 8% and consequently the slope of the chutes can be
        decreased considerably. The dropping water may be employed for
        driving mechanical means as will be described hereinafter.
        However, as a rule the valuable long-tailed timber cannot be
        conveyed on the chutes constructed for log-timber in consequence
        of their curvatures. And therefore it is of advantage to
        separate the long-tailed timber and convey it in another manner.
        According to the present invention this is accomplished in the
        following manner: --- </p>
      <p>A supporting device, for instance a wire-rope or rail, which
        follows the direction of the flow of the water, is arranged in a
        suitable height (about 7 feet) over the upper water-level above
        the short channel. Overhead cranes provided with chains or
        gripers, are arranged on this supporting device. After the
        long-tailed timber has been sucked into the short channel
        similar to the log timber, the overflow-door is raised, whereby
        the oncoming wood is stopped immediately and the long-tailed
        timber is disposed exactly underneath the supporting device. If
        the water rises further, the long-tailed timber is disposed
        exactly underneath the supporting device. If the water rises
        further, the long-tailed timber is also raised until it can be
        readily attached to the supporting device by means of chains or
        grippers. If the overflow-door is again lowered the water flows
        off faster in consequence of the gradient thus formed, the
        timber hanging on the supporting device is taken along and now
        freely floats, also at a slight gradient, with the speed
        imparted by the water, until it is deposited either at the place
        of destination or at a place, from which it is conveyed by
        vehicles or a waterway, adapted for long-tailed timber. </p>
      <p>A sorting device arranged at a retaining basin is illustrated
        in cross section by way of example on the accompanying drawings.
      </p>
      <p>A slightly inclined channel 42 (about 0.5:1000) is in
        communication with the retaining basin 41 for receiving the
        different kinds of timber, which come down from the different
        sides or are supplied upon chutes. A working stand 43 is
        arranged alongside the channel 42. An overflow door 44, which is
        vertically slidable in a slot 45, serves for closing the end of
        the channel 42 and is raised by the buoyancy of the water, in
        order to close the channel 42. An overflow door 44, which is
        vertically slidable in a slot 45, serves for closing the end of
        the channel 42 and is raised by the buoyancy of the water, in
        order to close the channel 42. Also upwardly acting weights,
        springs and the like (not illustrated) may be provided in order
        to promote the buoyancy and effect an automatic closing of the
        door. Rollers 46 are arranged on the door 44 and passes over
        pulleys 48 and 49. By means of a lever 50, attached to the
        pulley 49, the door 44 may be readily and comfortable operated
        from the working stand 43. The graduations I, II, and III of a
        dial correspond to the discharge parabolas I, II, and III. A
        water-discharge channel 51, located in front of the door 44 or
        slot 45, is sufficiently wide to allow the water to flow off
        even in case the door 44 is fully opened. </p>
      <p>The chute 52 for the long-timber is connected to the channel 51
        slightly below the floor of the channel 42. The chute 53 for the
        billet-wood lies below the chute 52. the wood passing over an
        inclined grating 54, which traverses the channel 51. A
        supporting rope 55 is arranged above the channel 42 and carries
        cable grippers 56, which are provided with chains 57 for
        securing the timber. </p>
      <p>The workman standing on the platform 43 controls the level of
        the water in the channel 42 according to the thickness of the
        timber passing through the latter at the time by raising or
        lowering the door 44 by means of the lever 50. If a log-timber
        enters the channel 42, the workman lowers the door 44 by means
        of the lever 50. If a log-timber enters the channel 42, the
        workman lowers the door 44 in such a way, that the log-timber is
        discharged onto the chute 52. In the case of billet-wood the
        door 44 is lowered to such an extent, that the same is
        discharged onto the chute 53, while the small pieces of wood are
        discharged through the channel 51 by operating the door in such
        a way, that the said wood follows the way of the discharge
        parabola I. </p>
