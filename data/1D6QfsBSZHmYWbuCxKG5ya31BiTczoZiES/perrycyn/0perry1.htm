      <p>A chemical commonly used in swimming pools could eliminate a
        major component of smog from the exhaust of vehicles and
        industrial power plants, a Livermore researcher said yesterday.
      </p>
      <p>The chemical is cyanuric acid, which is used to stabilize
        chlorine in swimming pools. When heated, the solid chemical
        produces a gas -- isocyanic acid -- which can be combined with
        the exhaust of an internal-combustion engine to neutralize the
        oxides of nitrogen produced by the burning of the fuel. </p>
      <p>The result is water vapor, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and certain
        other relatively benign gases. </p>
      <p>The discovery, being published today in the British journal
        Nature, was revealed by Robert A. Perry, a 33-year old chemist
        at the Combustion Research Facility operated by Sandia National
        Laboratories in Livermore. Sandia is a privately operated, but
        government financed, facility across the street from the
        Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. </p>
      <p>Perry and his colleagues said that isocyanuric acid introduced
        into the exhaust of a small diesel engine in their laboratory
        cleaned essentially all oxides of nitrogen from the exhaust of
        the engine. </p>
      <p>As advance word of the discovery began to circulate, officials
        at agencies charged with regulating air pollution showed intense
        but cautious interest. "A laboratory experiment is one thing",
        said one official. "Making it work in the real world is
        something else." </p>
      <p>Oxides of nitrogen, usually identified by the shorthand term
        Nox, pour into the air over the US at a rate of 27 million tons
        per year. Scientists blame Nox emissions for most of the
        eye-smarting ozone and the brownish air discoloration that is
        characteristic of smog. </p>
      <p>The oxides also are a significant source of nitric acid in acid
        rain, although most acid rain is blamed on sulfur compounds not
        affected by the process revealed yesterday. </p>
      <p>Perry’s report appears to mark a major success for the 5-year
        old combustion research lab, established specifically to find
        ways to increase efficiency and to reduce pollution from engines
        and industrial combustion. </p>
      <p>Yesterday’s disclosure marked the end of several years of
        experimental work for Perry and his colleagues, who were testing
        a number of compounds for neutralizing exhaust when they
        discovered that isocyanuric acid worked in 1985. </p>
      <p>Isocyanuric acid is released when cyanuric acid, is heated
        above about 625 degrees F. That is well below the exhaust
        temperatures typical of gasoline and diesel engines and the
        types of stationary power plants fueled by fossil fuels. </p>
      <p>If the cyanuric acid is introduced as it leaves the engine, the
        heat of the exhaust vaporizes the powder into isocyanuric acid.
        The isocyanuric acid then neutralizes the oxides of nitrogen
        that are an ordinary byproduct of combustion. </p>
      <p>"The reaction takes just a few milliseconds", Perry said. </p>
      <p>Perry bought the cyanuric acid first used in his lab at a
        swimming-pool supply house in Dublin, not far from his home. In
        swimming pools, it stabilizes the activity of chlorine compounds
        that disinfect and clarify the water. </p>
      <p>It is ideal for massive use in air pollution control, he said,
        because it is nontoxic and fairly cheap -- about $1 per pound.
        If used in an automobile, that amount should be enough to clean
        up about 500 miles worth of exhaust, he said. </p>
      <p>However, the main use for the process is not expected to be in
        privately owned autos, from which more than 90 per cent of NOx
        is already removed by catalytic converters, but rather in
        trucks’ diesel engines or at large stationary power plants. </p>
      <p>Because Sandia does not conduct applied research, the Dept. of
        Energy has awarded Perry exclusive rights to the patent on the
        process in exchange for retaining the right to use it without
        paying license fees. He now plans to quit Sandia and form a
        commercial company, called Technor, to market it. </p>
      <p>Perry’s discovery comes at a time when increasingly stringent
        air pollution regulations are&nbsp; being adopted by the US EPA,
        the California Air Resources Board and local pollution-control
        districts. </p>
      <p>The most urgent need for NOx control in California is in the LA
        basin, although severe problems also exist elsewhere. In Kern
        County, for instance, oilfield equipment is a major source of
        oxides of nitrogen. </p>
      <p>In the&nbsp; Bay Area, "Our priority really is not on the NOx",
        said Lew Robinson, director of planning at the Bay Area Air
        Quality Control Management District. "We are mainly worried
        about hydrocarbons, but I can see that this could be
        tremendously valuable in other parts of the country." </p>

      <p><b><i>Description ~ </i></b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a new method and device for removing
        NO.sub.x from gaseous material, e.g., from exhaust gas streams.
      </p>
      <p>The recent emphasis on ecological and environmental concerns,
        especially air pollution, acid rain, photochemical smog, etc.,
        has engendered a wide variety of proposed methods for removing
        NO.sub.x especially NO from gas streams. </p>
      <p>Certain proposed techniques involve a great deal of capital
        outlay and require major consumption of additives, scrubbers,
        etc. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,894,141 proposes a reaction
        with a liquid hydrocarbon; U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,587 proposes very
        high temperature burning with a hydrocarbon; U.S. Pat. No.
        4,448,899 proposes reaction with an iron chelate; and U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,262,751 reacts NO with a conjugated diolefin. Other
        methods utilize reactions with nitriles (U.S. Pat. No.
        4,080,425), organic N-compounds (e.g., amines or amides) (DE No.
        33 24 668) or pyridine (J57190638). Application of these
        reactions imposes organic pollutant disposal problems along with
        the attendant problems of toxicity and malodorous environments.
        In addition, they require the presence of oxygen and are
        relatively expensive. </p>
      <p>Other systems are based on urea reactions. For example, U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,119,702 uses a combination of urea and an oxidizing
        agent which decomposes it, e.g., ozone, nitric acid, inter alia;
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,924 utilizes urea in a high temperature
        reducing atmosphere; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,554 (the
        thermodenox system) utilizes a combination of ammonia and oxygen
        to react with nitric oxide. All of these methods must deal with
        the problem of the odor of ammonia and its disposal. All require
        oxygen or other oxidizing agents. These methods also suffer from
        the drawback of requiring controlled environments which make
        them difficult to use in mobile vehicles or smaller stationary
        devices. </p>
      <p>Japanese Publication No. J55051-420 does not relate to the
        removal of nitric oxide from gaseous systems, at least as
        reported in Derwent Abstract No. 38871C/22. It utilizes
        halocyanuric acid to remove malodorous fumes, e.g., mercaptans,
        sulfides, disulfides, ammonia or amines from gases by contact
        therewith followed by contact with activated carbon.
        Temperatures are reported as less than 80.degree. C.; classical
        acid/base interactions appear to be involved (not pyrolysis
        decomposition products of the halocyanuric acid). </p>
      <p>Back et al, Can. J. Chem. 46, 531 (1968), discusses the effect
        of NO on the photolysis of HNCO, the decomposition product of
        cyanuric acid. An increase of nitrogen concentration in the
        presence of large amounts of nitric oxide (torr levels) was
        observed utilizing a medium pressure mercury lamp for photolysis
        of HNCO. High temperature reactions were neither addressed nor
        involved; similarly, the effect, if any, of HNCO under any
        conditions on low amounts of NO (e.g., in the &lt; torr to ppm
        range) was also not addressed. In fact, the increased
        concentration of nitrogen was associated by the authors with
        high NO levels. Their theorized reactions explaining the results
        would be important only at high NO levels. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, use of cyanuric acid as a source of isocyanic acid
        (HNCO) for purposes of studying various properties of the latter
        or its subsequent degradation products is also known. See, e.g.,
        Okabe, J. Chem. Phys., 53, 3507 (1970) and Perry, J. Chem.
        Phys., 82, 5485 (1985). However, heretofore it was never
        suggested that cyanuric acid could be useful in the removal of
        NO from gas streams. </p>
      <p>As a result, there continues to be a need for a simple,
        relatively inexpensive, non-polluting, non-toxic, non-malodorous
        and regenerable system, method and device for removing nitric
        oxide from gas streams. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide such
        a system, method and device. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide such a
        method, system and device which is applicable to small
        stationary devices, mobile vehicles, as well as to larger
        applications, including smokestacks from plants, furnaces,
        manufacturing factories, kilns, vehicles, and essentially any
        other source of exhaust gas containing NO, particularly
        industrial gases. </p>
      <p>Upon further study of the specification and appended claims,
        further objects and advantages of this invention will become
        apparent to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>These objects have been attained by this invention by providing
        a method of reducing the NO content of a gas stream comprising
        contacting the gas stream with HNCO at a temperature effective
        for heat induced decomposition of HNCO and for resultant
        lowering of the NO content of the gas stream. It is preferred
        that the HNCO be generated by sublimation of cyanuric acid. </p>
      <p>In another aspect, these objects have been achieved by
        providing a device useful for reducing the NO content of a gas
        stream comprising: </p>
      <p>means for storing a compound which upon sublimation generates
        HNCO; </p>
      <p>means for subliming said compound in operation; </p>
      <p>means for contacting said NO-containing gas stream with said
        generated HNCO; and </p>
      <p>means for raising the temperature of said gas contacted with
        HNCO to a level effective for heat induced decomposition of HNCO
        and resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas stream. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect, these objects have been achieved by
        providing in a conduit means for an effluent gas stream
        containing NO, the improvement wherein the conduit means further
        comprises device means for lowering the NO content of said gas,
        said device means comprising: </p>
      <p>compartment means for storing a compound which upon sublimation
        generates HNCO; </p>
      <p>means for heating said compound to a temperature at which it
        sublimes; </p>
      <p>means for contacting said NO-containing gas stream with said
        generated HNCO; and </p>
      <p>means for raising the temperature of said HNCO-contacted gas
        stream to a level effective for heat induced decomposition of
        HNCO and resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas stream.
      </p>

      <p>Various other objects, features and attendant advantages of the
        present invention will be more fully appreciated as the same

      <p><b>DETAILED DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention provides many significant advantages over other
        theoretical and/or commercially available NO reducers. It is
        generically applicable to all industrial gas effluent streams,
        e.g., those mentioned in the references discussed above. It is
        very simple, inexpensive and portable. It does not require the
        use of catalysts and/or co-agents. In addition, when the
        preferred source of HNCO (cyanuric acid) is spent during
        operation, it can be simply and inexpensively replaced. It
        provides heretofore unachievable convenience and efficiency in
        reducing NO. Its non-toxicity is another major advantage as its
        ready availability and low cost. </p>
      <p>As opposed to many of the other systems now available, that of
        this invention imposes minimal changes in otherwise preferred
        operating conditions for the engine, plant, factory, etc., which
        generates the effluent gas stream being purified. For example,
        as opposed to presently utilized catalytic converters, this
        invention does not impose a requirement that a vehicular engine
        be run rich with resultant undesirable lower compression ratios.
        In addition, the requirement for use of unleaded gas in order to
        avoid catalyst poisoning also does not apply. Overall, the
        efficacy of the system of this invention in lowering NO contents
        is extremely high. </p>
      <p>Within the broadest scope of this invention, any source and/or
        means of generating HNCO and admixing it with the effluent
        stream can be used. For a variety of reasons including those
        discussed above, in the preferred embodiment, sublimation of
        cyanuric acid will be utilized: ##STR1## </p>
      <p>Isocyanuric acid is a tautomer of cyanuric acid. For purposes
        of this invention, the two are equivalent. The sublimation of
        cyanuric acid in accordance with the following equation,
        ##STR2## can be conducted at any temperature effective to cause
        a volatilization of sufficient HNCO for the desired purpose. In
        general, temperatures greater than 300.degree. C. will be
        utilized since sublimation rates at lower temperatures are
        generally too low. Preferably, temperatures greater than
        320.degree. C. will be used, especially greater than 350.degree.
        C. There is no preferred upper limit on temperature; but
        generally a temperature less than about 800.degree. C. will be
        employed. The precise temperature for a given application can be
        routinely selected, perhaps with a few orientation experiments,
        in conjunction with considerations of the volume to be filled,
        the flow rate of the gas, the resultant residence time of the
        admixture of HNCO and NO in the effluent gas stream, the surface
        area of the HNCO source which is being sublimed and the
        sublimation rate which ensues in a given system upon selection
        of the given temperature. For example, for 50 g of a cyanuric
        acid sample having a surface area of about 20 cm.sup.2, the
        sublimation rate achieved at a temperature of 450.degree. C. is
        sufficient to reduce the NO level from a 50 l/m gas stream from
        1000 ppm to essentially 0 ppm. </p>
      <p>While cyanuric acid itself is the preferred source of HNCO,
        other sublimable solids can also be used for its generation.
        These include other compounds which are typical impurities in
        samples of cyanuric acid, including ammelide and ammeline
        ##STR3## In general, cyanuric acid wherein the OH groups are
        replaced by 1-3 NH.sub.2, alkyl, NH-alkyl or N-alkyl.sub.2
        groups, are utilizable. Such alkyl groups typically will have
        1-4 carbon atoms. </p>
      <p>Also utilizable are oligomers of HNCO which are linear rather
        than cyclic as in cyanuric acid. For example, cyamelide is
        particularly noteworthy. Also utilizable are the known
        halocyanuric acids such as the mono-, di- or tri-chloro, bromo,
        fluoro or iodo acids or other various mixed-halo substituted
        acids. </p>
      <p>Any means or technique which results in admixture of HNCO with
        the NO-containing gas is included within the scope of this
        invention. For example, if the effluent gas stream itself is at
        a sufficiently elevated temperature, it can be directly passed
        over a solid sample of the HNCO source to effect sublimation and
        instantaneous admixture. It is also possible to incorporate the
        solid HNCO source into a solvent therefor, most preferably hot
        water, and conventionally spray or inject the solution into the
        effluent gas stream. Of course, it is also possible to use
        conventional heating means (e.g., conductive, inductive, etc.)
        to heat the sublimable source of HNCO and then to conventionally
        conduct the resultant HNCO gas into admixture with the effluent
        stream. Steam injection preceded by passage of the steam over,
        through, etc., the HNCO source such as cyanuric acid can, of
        course, also be utilized. </p>
      <p>It is also possible to indirectly admix the HNCO with the
        effluent gas stream. For example, if the HNCO is injected into
        the combustion chamber which produces the effluent gas stream or
        if the sublimable source such as cyanuric acid is so injected,
        the HNCO will be incorporated into the effluent gas stream at
        its point of generation. As long as the necessary reaction
        conditions are maintained for subsequent interaction of the HNCO
        with the NO in the gas stream, the NO reduction method of this
        invention will be accomplished. The latter option pertains to
        any system which generates an NO-containing stream, including
        vehicular engines (wherein the injection of cyanuric acid or
        HNCO can be accomplished via the conventional valves), furnaces,
        plants, etc. Alternatively, the admixture can be effected
        directly either downstream from the point of generation of the
        effluent gas or directly near or at this point, e.g., right at
        the head of the vehicular engine where the heat generated by the
        latter can be utilized, not only for sublimation of the solid
        source of HNCO, but also for effecting the NO reducing reactions
        based on the presence of HNCO. </p>
      <p>The NO content of the effluent streams into which the HNCO has
        been admixed will be lowered as long as the temperature of the
        effluent stream is raised to a level at which HNCO thermally
        decomposes into products which result in lowering of the NO
        content. The precise elevated temperature reached is not
        critical and will be routinely selected, perhaps in conjunction
        with preliminary orientation experiments, in dependence on the
        relative amounts of NO and HNCO and especially the residence
        time produced by the volumes and flow rates involved. Generally,
        temperatures on the order of about 400.degree. C. will suffice
        where residence times are greater than or equal to about one
        second. Higher temperatures can also be utilized, e.g., about
        400.degree. to 800.degree. C.; however, there will be an upper
        limit where the nature of the dominant reactions will change. In
        the regime of 450.degree.-700.degree. C. free radical reactions
        produce NO in the presence of oxygen. At elevated temperatures
        i.e., greater than 1200.degree. C., the presence of oxygen will
        make the production of nitric oxide unacceptable. </p>
      <p>Pressure is typically not a critical variable under all
        realistic applications. Thus, pressures in the range from about
        0.1-10 atmospheres as well as lower or higher values are
        employable. </p>
      <p>The relative amounts of NO and HNCO are not critical.
        Typically, the system will be designed so that stoichiometric
        amounts are employed. Of course, excesses of either ingredient
        can be designed where desirable. In many applications, it will
        be desired to utilize very slight, environmentally acceptable
        excesses of NO in order to avoid excesses of HNCO. The latter is
        an acid which might recyclize to cyanuric acid at the low
        temperatures ensuing after the reaction has run its course.
        Thus, since the excess of NO can be chosen to be benignly low in
        view of the great efficacy of this invention in reducing NO
        contents, and since the products of the overall NO-reduction
        reactions are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and carbon
        monoxide (with a minor component of CO), the resultant system
        containing benign amounts of NO will cause no environmental
        concerns. Of course, where otherwise desirable, the system can
        also be run with slight excesses of HNCO. Where excesses are
        employed of either ingredient, these can, e.g., be in the range
        of about 1.01 to about 1.1 or more on a stoichiometric basis. </p>
      <p>In a preferred mode of operation of this invention, the NO
        reduction reactions will be conducted in the presence of
        surfaces which act as a catalyst for the free radical reactions
        which effect the NO reduction. The nature of the surface is not
        critical as long as it is catalytically effective, metallic or
        otherwise. All those surfaces well known to catalyze related
        free radical reactions will be employable, e.g., metallic
        surfaces, oxides, etc. For metallic systems, preferably, the
        metal component will be iron which will typically be provided by
        the steel, stainless steel, or other iron-based surfaces
        utilized in plants, vehicles, factories, etc., and especially
        utilized in the conduits containing effluent gas streams, e.g.,
        mufflers, smokestacks, etc. Other typical metals include the
        usual transition metals, e.g., the noble metals, including
        platinum, palladium, rhodium, silver, gold, etc. as well as
        nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, vanadium, titanium, etc. In
        a further preferred embodiment, the reaction will be conducted
        in a chamber containing particles of such catalytic surfaces,
        e.g., pellets, beads, granules, etc. The particle sizes and
        distributions are not critical. As usual, the greater the
        surface area, the more efficient this effect will be. Where
        catalytic surfaces are utilized, residence times can be shorter
        and temperatures can be lower under otherwise identical
        conditions. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is felt
        that the catalytic effect is primarily exerted in initiating the
        generation of free radicals triggering chain reactions necessary
        for the NO reduction. </p>
      <p>Other components may also be present in the NO-containing
        stream without adversely impacting this invention. For example,
        where NO.sub.2 is involved, it also will be removed by this
        invention. However, under the normal conditions where NO is a
        problem, NO.sub.2 often is not a problem. The amount of NO in
        the effluent gas stream also is not critical. Typically, the
        amounts will be 1 ppm or more, e.g., 1-10,000 ppm or 10-5,000
        ppm, typically 100-1,000 ppm, etc. By routine, judicious
        selection of reaction conditions as described above, the amount
        of NO after admixture with HNCO can be reduced to any desired
        low level, including 0 ppm within limits of detection. Greater
        reductions in NO contents in a given system can be achieved by
        utilizing longer residence times and higher temperatures. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a system of this
        invention. The overall "device" 1 simply comprises means such as
        chamber 2 for holding the sublimable compound; means for heating
        the latter to its sublimation temperature, e.g., in FIG. 1 the
        means simply being the input gas stream 3 which is at an
        elevated temperature; means for contacting the resultant HNCO
        with the input stream, which here simply comprises the adjoining
        conduits whereby the input stream heats the cyanuric acid and
        the resultant HNCO is instantaneously mixed with the input
        stream; and means for conducting the reaction, here illustrated
        by furnace 4. Many other equivalents will be very clear to
        skilled workers. For example, one or both of the storage chamber
        and the furnace can be inductively, conductively, radiatively,
        etc., heated using external sources other than the input stream
        itself. One or both of storage chamber and furnace region can be
        located anywhere along the path of the effluent stream, e.g.,
        they can be located right at the head of an engine or the
        exhaust outlet of a furnace or plant. As discussed above, it is
        even possible for the storage means to be located upstream of
        the chamber which produces the effluent stream where this is
        practical. Conventional heat exchange means can also be
        incorporated into the system wherever desirable. In FIG. 1, the
        heat exchange means is the input gas itself. </p>
      <p>Without wishing to be bound by theory, the following is a
        proposed mechanism for the NO reduction system: ##STR4## </p>
      <p>As can be seen, free radicals are generated which cause chain
        reactions to ensue. This explains both the speed and high
        efficiency of the system in removing NO from the gas stream. The
        reaction mechanism is highly surprising since the weakest bond
        in the HNCO molecule has a strength of about 60 kcal whereupon
        it would have been expected that a much higher temperature than
        those in the range of 400.degree.-800.degree. C. would be
        necessary for a significant effect based on decomposition of
        HNCO. </p>
      <p>This mode of action also serves to further clarify the
        distinction between this invention and the more conventional
        chemistry known for HNCO, e.g., that is described in Back et
        al., supra. In the latter, no elevated temperatures were used;
        only a purely photolytic decomposition of HNCO was effected. In
        addition, the lower of NO content mentioned in this reference
        related only to relatively high pressures of NO in the several
        torr range. </p>
      <p>Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in
        the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the
        present invention to its fullest extent. The following preferred
        specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely
        illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the
        disclosure in any way whatsoever. </p>
      <p>In the preceding text and the following examples, all
        temperatures are set forth uncorrected in degrees Celsius and
        all parts and percentages are by weight; unless otherwise
        indicated. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>A 7.2 horsepower Onan diesel engine was utilized for the
        experiment. Its exhaust had a flow-rate of 100 l/m. A 2 l/m
        sample was introduced into a cyanuric acid sublimation chamber.
        The latter contained 50 g of cyanuric acid and the sublimation
        occurred at 350.degree. C. Thereafter, the mixture of HNCO and
        exhaust gas was passed through a furnace region packed with a
        bed of steel ball bearings. The temperature in the furnace
        region was maintained at a temperature equal to or greater than
        450.degree. C. utilizing a conventional heater. The effluent
        from the furnace region was passed into a NO.sub.x analyzer. The
        residence time in the furnace was about 1 second. </p>
      <p>The exhaust gas from the diesel engine included the usual soot,
        water, oxygen and CO.sub.2. Its 500 ppm NO content was reduced
        to less than 1 ppm (i.e., to the sensitivity level of the
        NO.sub.x analyzer). The load on the engine varied from 0.23 to
        0.8 with no effect observed on the process. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>Under the conditions of Example 1, 5 pounds of cyanuric acid
        (2.27 kg) is loaded into the holding chamber. This provides
        enough active ingredient (53 moles of HNCO) to remove
        approximately 50 moles of NO. At a typical NO concentration in a
        vehicle exhaust of 500 ppm, 2.5.times.10.sup.7 liters of gas can
        be scrubbed. This is sufficient to remove NO from the exhaust
        gas of automobiles for a driving range of approximately 1,500
        miles. </p>
      <p>The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by
        substituting the generically or specifically described reactants
        and/or operating conditions of this invention for those used in
        the preceding examples. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can
        easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this
        invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope
        thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the
        invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>An arrangement for reducing the NO content
        of a gas stream comprises contacting the gas stream with HNCO at
        a temperature effective for heat induced decomposition of HNCO
        and for resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas stream.
        Preferably, the HNCO is generated by sublimation of cyanuric
        acid. </p>
      <p><b>Description ~ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a new device for removing NO.sub.x
        from gaseous material, e.g., from exhaust gas streams. </p>
      <p>The recent emphasis on ecological and environmental concerns,
        especially air pollution, acid rain, photochemical smog, etc.,
        has engendered a wide variety of proposed methods for removing
        especially NO from gas streams. </p>
      <p>Certain proposed techniques involve a great deal of capital
        outlay and require major consumption of additives, scrubbers,
        etc. For example, USP 3,894,141 proposes a reaction with a
        liquid hydrocarbon; USP 4,405,587 proposes very high temperature
        burning with a hydrocarbon; USP 4,448,899 proposes reaction with
        an iron chelate; and USP 3,262,751 reacts NO with a conjugated
        diolefin. Other methods utilize reactions with nitriles (USP
        4,080,425), organic N-compounds (e.g., amines or amides) (DE 33
        24 668) or pyridine (J57190638). Application of these reactions
        imposes organic pollutant disposal problems along with the
        attendant problems of toxicity and malodorous environments. In
        addition, they require the presence of oxygen and are relatively
        expensive. </p>
      <p>Other systems are based on urea reactions. For example, USP
        4,119,702 uses a combination of urea and an oxidizing agent
        which decomposes it, e.g., ozone, nitric acid, inter alia; USP
        4,325,924 utilizes urea in a high temperature reducing
        atmosphere; and USP 3,900,554 (the thermodenox system) utilizes
        a combination of ammonia and oxygen to react with nitric oxide.
        All of these methods must deal with the problem of the odor of
        ammonia and its disposal. All require oxygen or other oxidizing
        agents. These methods also suffer from the drawback of requiring
        controlled environments which make them difficult to use in
        mobile vehicles or smaller stationary devices. </p>
      <p>Japanese Publication J55-51-420 does not relate to the removal
        of nitric oxide from gaseous systems, at least as reported in
        Derwent Abstract 38871C/22. It utilizes halocyanuric acid to
        remove malodorous fumes, e.g., mercaptans, sulfides, disulfides,
        ammonia or amines from gases by contact therewith followed by
        contact with activated carbon. Temperatures are reported as less
        than 80.degree. C.; classical acid/base interactions appear to
        be involved (not pyrolysis decomposition products of the
        halocyanuric acid). </p>
      <p>Back et al. Can. J. Chem. 46, 531 (1968), discusses the effect
        of NO on the photolysis of HNCO, the decomposition product of
        cyanuric acid. An increase of nitrogen concentration in the
        presence of large amounts of nitric oxide (torr levels) was
        observed utilizing a medium pressure mercury lamp for photolysis
        of HNCO. High temperature reactions were neither addressed nor
        involved; similarly, the effect, if any, of HNCO under any
        conditions on low amounts of NO (e.g., in the&lt;torr to ppm
        range) was also not addressed. In fact, the increased
        concentration of nitrogen was associated by the authors with
        high NO levels. Their theorized reactions explaining the results
        would be important only at high NO levels. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, use of cyanuric acid as a source of isocyanic acid
        (HNCO) for purposes of studying various properties of the latter
        or its subsequent degradation products is also known. See, e.g.,
        Okabe, J. Chem. Phys., 53, 3507 (1970) and Perry, J. Chem.
        Phys., 82, 5485 (1985). However, heretofore it was never
        suggested that cyanuric acid could be useful in the removal of
        NO from gas streams. </p>
      <p>As a result, there continues to be a need for a simple,
        relatively inexpensive, non-polluting, non-toxic non-malodorous
        and regenerable system, and device for removing nitric oxide
        from gas streams. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide such
        a system, and device. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide such a system
        and device which is applicable to small stationary devices,
        mobile vehicles, as well as to larger applications, including
        smokestacks from plants, furnaces, manufacturing factories,
        kilns, vehicles, and essentially any other source of exhaust gas
        containing NO, particularly industrial gases. </p>
      <p>Upon further study of the specification and appended claims,
        further objects and advantages of this invention will become
        apparent to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>These objects have been attained by this invention by providing
        a system of reducing the NO content of a gas stream comprising
        contacting the gas stream with HNCO at a temperature effective
        for heat induced decomposition of HNCO and for resultant
        lowering of the NO content of the gas stream. It is preferred
        that the HNCO be generated by sublimation of cyanuric acid. </p>
      <p>In another aspect, these objects have been achieved by
        providing a device useful for reducing the NO content of a gas
        stream comprising: </p>
      <p>means for storing a compound which upon sublimation generates
        HNCO; </p>
      <p>means for subliming said compound in operation; </p>
      <p>means for contacting said NO-containing gas stream with said
        generated HNCO; and </p>
      <p>means for raising the temperature of said gas contacted with
        HNCO to a level effective for heat induced decomposition of HNCO
        and resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas stream. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect, these objects have been achieved by
        providing in a conduit means for an effluent gas stream
        containing NO, the improvement wherein the conduit means further
        comprises device means for lowering the NO content of said gas,
        said device means comprising: </p>
      <p>compartment means for storing a compound which upon sublimation
        generates HNCO; </p>
      <p>means for heating said compound to a temperature at which it
        sublimes; </p>
      <p>means for contacting said NO-containing gas stream with said
        generated HNCO; and </p>
      <p>means for raising the temperature of said HNCO-contacted gas
        stream to a level effective for heat induced decomposition of
        HNCO and resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas stream.
      </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>Various other objects, features and attendant advantages of the
        present invention will be more fully appreciated as the same
        becomes better understood when considered in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters
        designate the same or similar parts throughout the several
        views, and wherein: </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 schematically illustrates one possible configuration for
        carrying out the method of this invention and for configuring
        the device and/or improved conduit of this invention. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention provides many significant advantages over other
        theoretical and/or commercially available NO reducers. It is
        generically applicable to all industrial gas effluent streams,
        e.g., those mentioned in the references discussed above. It is
        very simple, inexpensive and portable. It does not require the
        use of catalysts and/or co-agents. In addition, when the
        preferred source of HNCO (cyanuric acid) is spend during
        operation, it can be simply and inexpensively replaced. It
        provides heretofore unachievable convenience and efficiency in
        reducing NO. Its non-toxicity is another major advantage as its
        ready availability and low cost. </p>
      <p>As opposed to many of the other systems now available, that of
        this invention imposes minimal changes in otherwise preferred
        operating conditions for the engine, plant, factory, etc., which
        generates the effluent gas stream being purified. For example,
        as opposed to presently utilized catalytic converters, this
        invention does not impose a requirement that a vehicular engine
        be run rich with resultant undesirable lower compression ratios.
        In addition, the requirement for use of unleaded gas in order to
        avoid catalyst poisoning also does not apply. Overall, the
        efficacy of the system of this invention in lowering NO contents
        is extremely high. </p>
      <p>Within the broadest scope of this invention, any source and/or
        means of generating HNCO and admixing it with the effluent
        stream can be used. For a variety of reasons including those
        discussed above, in the preferred embodiment, sublimation of
        cyanuric acid will be utilized: ##STR1## </p>
      <p>Isocyanuric acid is a tautomer of cyanuric acid. For purposes
        of this invention, the two are equivalent. The sublimation of
        cyanuric acid in accordance with the following equation,
        ##STR2## can be conducted at any temperature effective to cause
        a volatilization of sufficient HNCO for the desired purpose. In
        general, temperatures greater than 300.degree. C. will be
        utilized since sublimation rates at lower temperatures are
        generally too low. Preferably, temperatures greater than
        320.degree. C. will be used, especially greater than 250.degree.
        C. There is no preferred upper limit on temperature; but
        generally a temperature less than about 800.degree. C. will be
        employed. The precise temperature for a given application can be
        routinely selected, perhaps with a few orientation experiments,
        in conjunction with considerations of the volume to be filled,
        the flow rate of the gas, the resultant residence time of the
        admixture of HNCO and NO in the effluent gas stream, the surface
        area of the HNCO source which is being sublimed and the
        sublimation rate which ensues in a given system upon selection
        of the given temperature. For example, for 50 g of a cyanuric
        acid sample having a surface area of about 20 cm.sup. 2, the
        sublimation rate achieved at a temperature of 450.degree. C. is
        sufficient to r3educe the NO level from a 50 l/m gas stream from
        1000 ppm to essentially 0 ppm. </p>
      <p>While cyanuric acid itself is the preferred source of HNCO,
        other sublimable solids can also be used for its generation.
        These include other compounds which are typical impurities in
        samples of cyanuric acid, including ammelide and ammeline
        ##STR3## In general, cyanuric acid wherein the OH groups are
        replaced by 1-3 NH.sub.2 , alkyl, NH-alkyl or N-alkyl.sub.2
        groups, are utilizable. Such alkyl groups typically will have
        1-4 carbon atoms. </p>
      <p>Also utilizable are oligomers of HNCO which are linear rather
        than cyclic as in cyanuric acid. For example, cyamelide is
        particularly noteworthy. Also utilizable are the known
        halocyanuric acids such as the mono-, di- or tri-chloro, bromo,
        fluoro or iodo acids or other various mixed-halo substituted
        acids. </p>
      <p>Any means or technique which results in admixture of HNCO with
        the NO-contianing gas is included within the scope of this
        invention. For example, if the effluent gas stream itself is at
        a sufficiently elevated temperature, it can be directly passed
        over a solid sample of the HNCO source to effect sublimation and
        instantaneous admixture. It is also possible to incorporate the
        solid HNCO source into a solvent therefor, most preferably hot
        water, and conventionally spray or inject the solution into the
        effluent gas stream. Of course, it is also possible to use
        conventional heating means (e.g., conductive, inductive, etc.)
        to heat the sublimable source of HNCO and then to conventionally
        conduct the resultant HNCO gas into admixture with the effluent
        stream. Steam injection preceded by passage of the steam over,
        through, etc., the HNCO source such as cyanuric acid can, of
        course, also be utilized. </p>
      <p>It is also possible to indirectly admix the HNCO with the
        effluent gas stream. For example, if the HNCO is injected into
        the combustion chamber which produces the effluent gas stream or
        if the sublimable source such as cyanuric acid is so injected,
        the HNCO will be incorporated into the effluent gas stream at
        its point of generation. As long as the necessary reaction
        conditions are maintained for subsequent interaction of the HNCO
        with the NO in the gas stream, the NO reduction method of this
        invention will be accomplished. The latter option pertains to
        any system which generates an NO-containing stream, including
        vehicular engines (wherein the injection of cyanuric acid or
        HNCO can be accomplished via the conventional valves), furnaces,
        plants, etc. Alternatively, the admixture can be effected
        directly either downstream from the point of generation of the
        effluent gas or directly near or at this point, e.g., right at
        the head of the vehicular engine where the heat generated by the
        latter can be utilized, not only for sublimation of the solid
        source of HNCO, but also for effecting the NO reducing reactions
        based on the presence of HNCO. </p>
      <p>The NO content of the effluent streams into which the HNCO has
        been admixed will be lowered as long as the temperature of the
        effluent stream is raised to a level at which HNCO thermally
        decomposes into products which result in lowering of the NO
        content. The precise elevated temperature reached is not
        critical and will be routinely selected, perhaps in conjunction
        with preliminary orientation experiments, in dependence on the
        relative amounts of NO and HNCO and especially the residence
        time produced by the volumes and flow rates involved. Generally,
        temperatures on the order of about 400.degree. C. will suffice
        where residence times are greater than or equal to about one
        second. Higher temperatures can also be utilized, e.g., about
        400 to 800.degree. C.; however, there will be an upper limit
        where the nature of the dominant reactions will change. In the
        regime of 450.degree.-700.degree. C. free radical reactions
        produce NO in the presence of oxygen. This effect can be
        controlled by the addition of oxygen scavengers or increased
        concentrations of HNCO to consume the nitric oxide produced. At
        elevated temperatures, however, i.e., greater than 1200.degree.
        C., the presence of oxygen will make the production of nitric
        oxide unacceptable. </p>
      <p>Pressure is typically not a critical variable under all
        realistic applications. Thus, pressures in the range from abou
        0.1-10 atmospheres as well as lower or higher values are
        employable. </p>
      <p>The relative amounts of NO and HNCO are not critical.
        Typically, the system will be designed so that stoichiometric
        amounts are employed. Of course, excesses of either ingredient
        can be designed where desirable. In many applications, it will
        be desired to utilize very slight, environmentally acceptable
        excesses of NO in order to avoid excesses of HNCO. The latter is
        an acid which might recyclize to cyanuric acid at the low
        temperatures ensuing after the reaction has run its course.
        Thus, since the excess of NO can be chosen to be benignly low in
        view of the great efficacy of this invention in reducing NO
        contents, and since the products of the overall NO-reduction
        reactions are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and carbon
        monoxide (with a minor component of CO), the resultant system
        containing benign amounts of NO will cause no environmental
        concerns. Of course, where otherwise desirable, the system can
        also be run with slight excesses of HNCO. Where excesses are
        employed of either ingredient, these can, e.g., be in the range
        of about 1.01 to abou 1.1 or more on a stoichiometric basis. </p>
      <p>In a preferred mode of operation of this invention, the NO
        reduction reactions will be conducted in the presence of
        surfaces which act as a catalyst for the free radical reactions
        which effect the NO reduction. The nature of the surface is not
        critical as long as it is catalytically effective, metallic or
        otherwise. All those surfaces well known to catalyze related
        free radical reactions will be employable, e.g., metallic
        surfaces, oxides, etc. For metallic systems, preferably, the
        metal component will be iron which will typically be provided by
        the steel, stainless steel, or other iron-based surfaces
        utilized in plants, vehicles, factories, etc., and especially
        utilized in the conduits containing effluent gas streams, e.g.,
        mufflers, smokestacks, etc. Other typical metals include the
        usual transition metals, e.g., the nobel metals, including
        platinum, palladium, rhodium, silver, gold, etc. as well as
        nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, vanadium, titanium, etc. In
        a further preferred embodiment, the reaction will be conducted
        in a chamber containing particles of such catalytic surfaces,
        e.g., pellets, beads, granules, etc. The particle sizes and
        distributions are not critical. As usual, the greater the
        surface area, the more efficient this effect will be. Where
        catalytic surfaces are utilized, residence times can be shorter
        and temperatures can be lower under otherwise identical
        conditions. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is felt
        that the catalytic effect is primarily exerted in initiating the
        generation of free radicals triggering chain reactions necessary
        for the NO reduction. </p>
      <p>Other components may also be present in the NO-containing
        stream without adversely impacting this invention. For example,
        where NO.sub.2 is involved, it also will be removed by this
        invention. However, under the normal conditions where NO is a
        problem, NO.sub.2 often is not a problem. The amount of NO in
        the effluent gas stream also is not critical. Typically, the
        amounts will be 1 ppm or more, e.g., 1-10,000 ppm or 10-5,000
        ppm, typically 100-1,000 ppm, etc. By routine, judicious
        selection of reaction conditions as described above, the amount
        of NO after admixture with HNCO can be reduced to any desired
        low level, including 0 ppm within limits of detection. Greater
        reductions in NO contents in a given system can be achieved by
        utilizing longer residence times and higher temperatures. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a system of this
        invention. The overall "device" 1 simply comprises means such as
        chamber 2 for holding the sublimable compound; means for heating
        the latter to its sublimation temperature, e.g., in FIG. 1 the
        means simply being the input gas stream 3 which is at an
        elevated temperature; means for contacting the resultant HNCO
        with the input stream, which here simply comprises the adjoining
        conduits whereby the input stream heats the cyanuric acid and
        the resultant HNCO is instantaneously mixed with the input
        stream; and means for conducting the reaction, here illustrated
        by furnace 4. Many other equivalents will be very clear to
        skilled workers. For example, one or both of the storage chamber
        and the furnace can be inductively, conductively, radiatively,
        etc., heated using external sources other than the input stream
        itself. One or both of storage chamber and furnace region can be
        located anywhere along the path of the effluent stream, e.g.,
        they can be located right at the head of an engine or the
        exhaust outlet of a furnace or plant. As discussed above, it is
        even possible for the storage means to be located upstream of
        the chamber which produces the effluent stream where this is
        practical. Conventional heat exchange means can also be
        incorporated into the system wherever desirable. In FIG. 1, the
        heat exchange means is the input gas itself. </p>
      <p>Without wishging to be bound by theory, the following is a
        proposed mechanism for the NO reduction system: ##STR4## </p>
      <p>As can be seen, free radicals are generated which cause chain
        reactions to ensue. This explains both the speed and high
        efficiency of the system in removing NO from the gas stream. The
        reaction mechanism is highly surprising since the weakest bond
        in the HNCO molecule has a strength of about 60 kcal whereupon
        it would have been expected that a much higher temperature than
        those in the range of 400.degree.-800.degree. C. would be
        necessary for a significant effect based on decomposition of
        HNCO. </p>
      <p>This mode of action also serves to further clarify the
        distinction between this invention and the more conventional
        chemistry known for HNCO, e.g., that is described in Back et
        al., supra. In the latter, no elevated temperatures were used;
        only a purely photolytic decomposition of HNCO was effected. In
        addition, the lowering of NO content mentioned in this reference
        related only to relatively high pressures of NO in the several
        torr range. </p>
      <p>This reaction mechanism also explains an observed interfering
        effect of oxygen on the system of this invention. The hydrogen
        atoms produced during the course of this invention will react
        with oxygen to produce OH and O. In turn, these species will
        result in production of NO and H: </p>
      <p>H+O.sub.2 .fwdarw.OH+O </p>
      <p>O+HNCO.fwdarw.HNO+CO </p>
      <p>HNO.fwdarw.NO+H </p>
      <p>This reaction mechanism will be significant at temperatures on
        the order of 450.degree. C. or higher. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, any of the known scavengers of O can be included
        in the reaction system when oxygen is present in order to
        eliminate or very significantly ameliorate the oxygen effect.
        The preferred scavenger is water which exerts its effect in
        accordance with the following equations: </p>
      <p>O+H.sub.2 O.revreaction.2OH </p>
      <p>OH+CO.fwdarw.CO.sub.2 +H </p>
      <p>As a result, H atoms are regenerated without coproduction of
        NO. This permits the reaction: </p>
      <p>H+HNCO.fwdarw.NH.sub.2 +CO </p>
      <p>to dominate with overall loss of NO. </p>
      <p>Generally the molar ratio of H.sub.2 O ot O.sub.2 can be in the
        range of 2-5 to 1. </p>
      <p>Under typical operating conditions of vehicular engines now in
        use, the above potential interfering effect of O.sub.2 will
        inherently be avoided because of the inherent presence of
        H.sub.2 O in the effluent gas streams emanating from such
        engines. However, where oxygen is present and the necessary O
        scavenger is not inherently provided, any conventional means for
        introducing a scavenger such as water can be utilized. Many
        other scavengers can also be employed, e.g., typical components
        of fuels utilized in engines, furnaces, plants, etc., including
        alkenes, other unsaturated hydrocarbons, and many other well
        known organic compounds. As an alternative to use of suitable
        scavengers, increased concentrations of HNCO can be used to
        reduce nitric oxide that is produced by the presence of oxygen.
      </p>
      <p>Under operating conditions usually encountered, there should be
        not other significant interferants for the system of this
        invention, i.e, no other species which will react fast with H
        alone. In general, conditions under which high concentrations of
        such species are generated will be conditions wherein not much
        NO is generated anyway. Where NO is a problem, it is unlikely
        that species other than O.sub.2 will be interferring. Where
        species which are slow reacting with H atoms are present in high
        concentration, they will pose much more significant pollution
        problems than NO itself. </p>
      <p>Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in
        the art can, using the preceding description, utilize the
        present invention to its fullest extent. The following preferred
        specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely
        illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the
        disclosure in any way whatsoever. </p>
      <p>In the preceding text and the following examples, all
        temperatures are set forth uncorrected in degrees Celsius and
        all parts and percentages are by weight; unless otherwise
        indicated. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>A 7.2 horsepower Onan diesel engine was utilized for the
        experiment. Its exhaust had a flow-rate of 100 l/m. A 2 l/m
        sample was introduced into a cyanuric acid sublimation chamber.
        The latter contained 50 g of cyanuric acid and the sublimation
        occurred at 350.degree. C. Thereafter, the mixture of HNCO and
        exhaust gas was passed through a furnace region packed with a
        bed of steel ball bearings. The temperature in the furnace
        region was maintained at a temperature equal to or greater than
        450.degree. C. utilizing a conventional heater. The effluent
        from the furnace region was passed into a NO.sub.x analyzer. The
        residence time in the furnace was about 1 second. </p>
      <p>The exhaust gas from the diesel engine included the usual soot,
        water, oxygen and CO.sub.2. Its 500 ppm NO content was reduced
        to less than 1 ppm (i.e., to the sensitivity level of the
        NO.sub.x analyzer). The load on the engine varied from 0.23 to
        0.8 with no effect observed on the process. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>Under the conditions of Example 1, 5 pounds of cyanuric acid
        (2.27 kg) is loaded into the holding chamber. This provides
        enough active ingredient (53 moles of HNCO) to remove
        approximately 50 moles of NO. At a typical NO concentration in a
        vehicle exhaust of 500 ppm, 2.5.times.10.sup.7 liters of gas can
        be scrubbed. This is sufficient to remove NO from the exhaust
        gas of automobiles for a driving range of approximately 1,500
        miles. </p>
      <p>The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by
        substituting the generically or specifically described reactants
        and/or operating conditions of this invention for those used in
        the preceding examples. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can
        easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this
        invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope
        thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the
        invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~&nbsp; </b>An arrangement for reducing the NO
        content of a gas stream comprises contacting the gas stream with
        HNCO at a temperature effective for heat induced decomposition
        of HNCO and for resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas
        stream. Preferably, the HNCO is generated by sublimation of
        cyanuric acid and CO or other H-atom generating species is also
        present or added to the gas stream. </p>
      <p><b><i>Description ~ </i></b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a new method and device for removing
        NO.sub.x from gaseous material, e.g., from exhaust gas streams.
      </p>
      <p>The recent emphasis on ecological and environmental concerns,
        especially air pollution, acid rain, photochemical smog, etc.,
        has engendered a wide variety of proposed methods for removing
        NO.sub.x, especially NO, from gas streams. </p>
      <p>Certain proposed techniques involve a great deal of capital
        outlay and require major consumption of additives, scrubbers,
        etc. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,894,141 proposes a reaction
        with a liquid hydrocarbon; U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,587 proposes very
        high temperature burning with a hydrocarbon; U.S.P. 4,448,899
        proposes reaction with an iron chelate; and U.S. Pat. No.
        3,262,751 reacts NO with a conjugated diolefin. Other methods
        utilize reactions with nitriles (U.S. Pat. No. 4,080,425),
        organic N-compounds (e.g., amines or amides) (DE No. 33 24 668)
        or pyridine (No. J57190638). Application of these reactions
        imposes organic pollutant disposal problems along with the
        attendant problems of toxicity and malodorous environments. In
        addition, they require the presence of oxygen and are relatively
        expensive. </p>
      <p>Other systems are based on urea reactions. For example, U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,119,702 uses a combination of urea and an oxidizing
        agent which decomposes it, e.g., ozone, nitric acid, inter alia;
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,924 utilizes urea in a high temperature
        reducing atmosphere; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,554 (the
        thermodenox system) utilizes a combination of ammonia and oxygen
        to react with nitric oxide. All of these methods must deal with
        the problem of the odor of ammonia and its disposal. All require
        oxygen or other oxidizing agents. These methods also suffer from
        the drawback of requiring controlled environments which make
        them difficult to use in mobile vehicles or smaller stationary
        devices. </p>
      <p>Japanese Publication No. J55051-420 does not relate to the
        removal of nitric oxide from gaseous systems, at least as
        reported in Derwent Abstract 38871C/22. It utilizes halocyanuric
        acid to remove malodorous fumes, e.g., mercaptans, sulfides,
        disulfides, ammonia or amines from gases by contact therewith
        followed by contact with activated carbon. Temperatures are
        reported as less than 80.degree. C.; classical acid/base
        interactions appear to be involved (not pyrolysis decomposition
        products of the halocyanuric acid). </p>
      <p>Back et al, Can. J. Chem. 46, 531 (1968), discusses the effect
        of NO on the photolysis of HNCO, the decomposition product of
        cyanuric acid. An increase of nitrogen concentration in the
        presence of large amounts of nitric oxide (torr levels) was
        observed utilizing a medium pressure mercury lamp for photolysis
        of HNCO. High temperature reactions were neither addressed nor
        involved; similarly, the effect, if any, of HNCO under any
        conditions on low amounts of NO (e.g., in the &lt;torr to ppm
        range) was also not addressed. In fact, the increased
        concentration of nitrogen was associated by the authors with
        high NO levels. Their theorized reactions explaining the results
        would be important only at high NO levels. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, use of cyanuric acid as a source of isocyanic acid
        (HNCO) for purposes of studying various properties of the latter
        or its subsequent degradation products is also known. See, e.g.,
        Okabe, J. Chem. Phys., 53, 3507 (1970) and Perry, J. Chem.
        Phys., 82, 5485 (1985). </p>
      <p>J.P. No. 54-28771 discloses the addition of relatively large
        particles (0.1-10 mm, preferably 0.5-5.0 mm) of cyanuric acid at
        temperatures generically disclosed as 600.degree.-1500.degree.
        C., but preferably at high temperatures of
        1200.degree.-1300.degree. C., for removal of NO.sub.x from
        exhaust gas. The theory of operation disclosed in this
        publication appears to involve a reaction occurring on the
        surface of the particle which leads to the requirements of the
        high particle size and high temperature. It is explicitly stated
        in the publication that, "If the diameter of the granule is too
        small, the efficiency goes down." There is no suggestion in this
        publication that the active species effecting the treatment of
        the exhaust gas is itself gaseous and certainly no suggestion
        that the gaseous species is HNCO. As a result, the conditions
        disclosed in this reference lead away from those which are most
        applicable to a reaction of NO.sub.x with gaseous HNCO.
        Consequently, the process of this reference is believed not to
        have been used on a technical scale. </p>
      <p>As a result, there continues to be a need for a simple,
        relatively inexpensive, non-polluting, non-toxic, non-malodorous
        and regenerable system, method and device for removing nitric
        oxide from gas streams. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide such
        a system, method and device. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide such a
        method, system and device which is applicable to small
        stationary devices, mobile vehicles, as well as to larger
        applications, including smokestacks from plants, furnaces,

      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>Various other objects, features and attendant advantages of the
        present invention will be more fully appreciated as the same
        becomes better understood when considered in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters
        designate the same or similar parts throughout the several
        views, and wherein: </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 schematically illustrates one possible configuration for
        carrying out the method of this invention and for configuring
        the device and/or improved conduit of this invention. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention provides many significant advantages over other
        theoretical and/or commercially available NO reducers. It is
        generically applicable to all industrial gas effluent streams,
        e.g., those mentioned in the references discussed above. It is
        very simple, inexpensive and portable. It does not require the
        use of catalysts and/or co-agents. In addition, when the
        preferred source of HNCO (cyanuric acid) is spent during
        operation, it can be simply and inexpensively replaced. It
        provides heretofore unachievable convenience and efficiency in
        reducing NO. Its non-toxicity is another major advantage as is
        its ready availability and cost. </p>
      <p>As opposed to many of the other systems now available, that of
        this invention imposes minimal changes in otherwise preferred
        operating conditions for the engine, plant, factory, etc., which
        generates the effluent gas stream being purified. For example,
        as opposed to presently utilized catalytic converters, this
        invention does not impose a requirement that a vehicular engine
        be run rich with resultant undesirable lower compression ratios.
        In addition, the requirement for use of unleaded gas in order to
        avoid catalyst poisoning also does not apply. Overall, the
        efficacy of the system of this invention in lowering NO contents
        is extremely high. </p>
      <p>Within the broadest scope of this invention, any source and/or
        means of generating HNCO and admixing it with the effluent
        stream can be used. For a variety of reasons including those
        discussed above, in the preferred embodiment, sublimation of
        cyanuric acid will be utilized: ##STR1## </p>
      <p>Isocyanuric acid is a tautomer of cyanuric acid. For purposes
        of this invention, the two are equivalent. The sublimation of
        cyanuric acid in accordance with the following equation,
        ##STR2## can be conducted at any temperature effective to cause
        a volatilization of sufficient HNCO for the desired purpose. In
        general, temperatures greater than 300.degree. C. will be
        utilized since sublimation rates at lower temperatures are
        generally too low. Preferably, temperatures greater than
        320.degree. C. will be used, especially greater than 350.degree.
        C. There is no preferred upper limit on temperature; but
        generally a temperature less than about 800.degree. C. will be
        employed. The precise temperature for a given application can be
        routinely selected, perhaps with a few orientation experiments,
        in conjunction with considerations of the volume to be filled,
        the flow rate of the gas, the resultant residence time of the
        admixture of HNCO and NO in the effluent gas stream, the surface
        area of the HNCO source which is being sublimed the sublimation
        rate which ensues in a given system upon selection of the given
        temperature. For example, for 50 g of a cyanuric acid sample
        having a surface area of about 20 cm.sup.2, the sublimation rate
        achieved at a temperature of 450.degree. C. is sufficient to
        reduce the NO level from a 50 l/m gas stream from 1000 ppm to
        essentially 0 ppm. </p>
      <p>While cyanuric acid itself is the preferred source of HNCO,
        other sublimable solids can also be used for its generation.
        These include other compounds which are typical impurities in
        samples of cyanuric acid, including ammelide and ammeline
        ##STR3## In general, cyanuric acid wherein the OH groups are
        replaced by 1-3 NH.sub.2, alkyl, NH-alkyl or N-alkyl.sub.2
        groups, are utilizable. Such alkyl groups typically will have
        1-4 carbon atoms. </p>
      <p>Also utilizable are oligomers of HNCO which are linear rather
        than cyclic as in cyanuric acid. For example, cyamelide is
        particularly noteworthy. Also utilizable are the known
        halocyanuric acids such as the mono-, di- or tri-chloro, bromo,
        fluoro or iodo acids or other various mixed-halo substituted
        acids. </p>
      <p>Any means or technique which results in admixture of HNCO with
        the NO-containing gas is included within the scope of this
        invention. For example, if the effluent gas stream itself is at
        a sufficiently elevated temperature, it can be directly passed
        over a solid sample of the HNCO source to effect sublimation and
        instantaneous admixture. It is also possible to incorporate the
        solid HNCO source into a solvent therefor, most preferably hot
        water, and conventionally spray or inject the solution into the
        effluent gas stream. Of course, it is also possible to use
        conventional heating means (e.g., conductive, inductive, etc.)
        to heat the sublimable source of HNCO and then to conventionally
        conduct the resultant HNCO gas into admixture with the effluent
        stream. Steam injection preceded by passage of the steam over,
        through, etc., the HNCO source such as cyanuric acid can, of
        course, also be utilized. </p>
      <p>It is also possible to indirectly admix the HNCO with the
        effluent gas stream. For example, if the HNCO is injected into
        the combustion chamber which produces the effluent gas stream or
        if the sublimable source such as cyanuric acid is so injected,
        the HNCO will be incorporated into the effluent gas stream at
        its point of generation. As long as the necessary reaction
        conditions are maintained for subsequent interaction of the HNCO
        with the NO in the gas stream, the NO reduction method of this
        invention will be accomplished. The latter option pertains to
        any system which generates an NO-containing stream, including
        vehicular engines (wherein the injection of cyanuric acid or
        HNCO can be accomplished via the conventional valves), furnaces,
        plants, etc. Alternatively, the admixture can be effected
        directly either downstream from the point of generation of the
        effluent gas or directly near or at this point, e.g., right at
        the head of the vehicular engine where the heat generated by the
        latter can be utilized, not only for sublimation of the solid
        source of HNCO, but also for effecting the NO reducing reactions
        based on the presence of HNCO. </p>
      <p>The NO content of the effluent streams into which the HNCO has
        been admixed will be lowered as long as the temperature of the
        effluent stream is raised to a level at which HNCO thermally
        decomposes into products which result in lowering of the NO
        content. The precise elevated temperature reached is not
        critical and will be routinely selected, perhaps in conjunction
        with preliminary orientation experiments, in dependence on the
        relative amounts of NO and HNCO and especially the residence
        time produced by the volumes and flow rates involved. Generally,
        temperatures on the order of about 400.degree. C. will suffice
        where residence times are greater than or equal to about one
        second. Higher temperatures can also be utilized, e.g., about
        400.degree. to 800.degree. C.; however, there will be an upper
        limit where the nature of the dominant reactions will change. In
        the regime of 450.degree.-700.degree. C. free radical reactions
        can theoretically produce NO in the presence of oxygen. This
        effect can be controlled if it were necessary by the addition of
        oxygen scavengers or increased concentrations of HNCO to consume
        the nitric oxide produced. At elevated temperatures, i.e.,
        greater than 1200.degree. C., the presence of oxygen will make
        the production of nitric oxide unacceptable. </p>
      <p>Pressure is typically not a critical variable under all
        realistic applications. Thus, pressures in the range from about
        0.1-10 atmospheres as well as lower or higher values are
        employable. </p>
      <p>The relative amounts of NO and HNCO are not critical.
        Typically, the system will be designed so that stoichiometric
        amounts are employed. Of course, excesses of either ingredient
        can be designed where desirable. In many applications, it will
        be desired to utilize very slight, environmentally acceptable
        excesses of NO in order to avoid excesses of HNCO. The latter is
        an acid which might recyclize to cyanuric acid at the low
        temperatures ensuing after the reaction has run its course.
        Thus, since the excess of NO can be chosen to be benignly low in
        view of the great efficacy of this invention in reducing NO
        contents, and since the products of the overall NO-reduction
        reactions are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and carbon
        monoxide (with a minor component of CO), the resultant system
        containing benign amounts of NO will cause no environmental
        concerns. Of course, where otherwise desirable, the system can
        also be run with slight excesses of HNCO. Where excesses are
        employed of either ingredient, these can, e.g., be in the range
        of about 1.01 to about 1.1 or more on a stoichiometric basis. </p>
      <p>In a preferred mode of operation of this invention, the NO
        reduction reactions will be conducted in the presence of
        surfaces which act as a catalyst for the free radical reactions
        which effect the NO reduction. The nature of the surface is not
        critical as long as it is catalytically effective, metallic or
        otherwise. All those surfaces well known to catalyze related
        free radical reactions will be employable, e.g., metallic
        surfaces, oxides, etc. For metallic systems, preferably, the
        metal component will be iron which will typically be provided by
        the steel, stainless steel, or other iron-based surfaces
        utilized in plants, vehicles, factories, etc., and especially
        utilized in the conduits containing effluent gas streams, e.g.,
        mufflers, smokestacks, etc. Other typical metals include the
        usual transition metals, e.g., the noble metals, including
        platinum, palladium, rhodium, silver, gold, etc. as well as
        nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, vanadium, titanium, etc. In
        a further preferred embodiment, the reaction will be conducted
        in a chamber containing particles of such catalytic surfaces,
        e.g., pellets, beads, granules, etc. The particle sizes and
        distributions are not critical. As usual, the greater the
        surface area, the more efficient this effect will be. Where
        catalytic surfaces are utilized, residence times can be shorter
        and temperatures can be lower under otherwise identical
        conditions. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is felt
        that the catalytic effect is primarily exerted in initiating the
        generation of free radicals triggering chain reactions necessary
        for the NO reduction. </p>
      <p>Other components may also be present in the NO-containing
        stream without adversely impacting this invention. For example,
        where NO.sub.2 is involved, it also will be removed by this
        invention. However, under the normal conditions where NO is a
        problem, NO.sub.2 often is not a problem. The amount of NO in
        the effluent gas stream also is not critical. Typically, the
        amounts will be 1 ppm or more, e.g., 1-10,000 ppm or 10-5,000
        ppm, typically 100-1,000 ppm, etc. By routine, judicious
        selection of reaction conditions as described above, the amount
        of NO after admixture with HNCO can be reduced to any desired
        low level, including 0 ppm within limits of detection. Greater
        reductions in NO contents in a given system can be achieved by
        utilizing longer residence times and higher temperatures. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a system of this
        invention. The overall "device" 1 simply comprises means such as
        chamber 2 for holding the sublimable compound; means for heating
        the latter to its sublimation temperature, e.g., in FIG. 1 the
        means simply being the input gas stream 3 which is at an
        elevated temperature; means for contacting the resultant HNCO
        with the input stream, which here simply comprises the adjoining
        conduits whereby the input stream heats the cyanuric acid and
        the resultant HNCO is instantaneously mixed with the input
        stream; and means for conducting the reaction, here illustrated
        by furnace 4. Many other equivalents will be very clear to
        skilled workers. For example, one or both of the storage chamber
        and the furnace can be inductively, conductively, radiatively,
        etc., heated using external sources other than the input stream
        itself. One or both of storage chamber and furnace region can be
        located anywhere along the path of the effluent stream, e.g.,
        they can be located right at the head of an engine or the
        exhaust outlet of a furnace or plant. As discussed above, it is
        even possible for the storage means to be located upstream of
        the chamber which produces the effluent stream where this is
        practical. Conventional heat exchange means can also be
        incorporated into the system wherever desirable. In FIG. 1, the
        heat exchange means is the input gas itself. </p>
      <p>Without wishing to be bound by theory, the following is a
        proposed mechanism for the NO reduction system: ##STR4## </p>
      <p>As can be seen, free radicals are generated which cause chain
        reactions to ensue. This explains both the speed and high
        efficiency of the system in removing NO from the gas stream. The
        reaction mechanism is highly surprising since the weakest bond
        in the HNCO molecule has a strength of about 60 kcal whereupon
        it would have been expected that a much higher temperature than
        those in the range of 400.degree.-800.degree. C. would be
        necessary for a significant effect based on decomposition of
        HNCO. </p>
      <p>This mode of action also serves to further clarify the
        distinction between this invention and the more conventional
        chemistry known for HNCO, e.g., that is described in Back et
        al., supra. In the latter, no elevated temperatures were used;
        only a purely photolytic decomposition of HNCO was effected In
        addition, the lowering of NO content mentioned in this reference
        related only to relatively high pressures of NO in the several
        torr range. </p>
      <p>This reaction mechanism also involves a possible interfering
        effect of oxygen on the system of this invention. The hydrogen
        atoms produced during the course of this invention will react
        with oxygen to produce OH and O. In turn, these species will
        result in production of NO and H: ##STR5## This mechanism of
        producing NO, however, is generally not important at
        temperatures of about 1100.degree.-1200.degree. C. or lower.
        Another NO-producing, H-atom mechanism is ##STR6## This is
        significant at low temperatures; its adverse influence can be
        significantly ameliorated by the H atom producing or
        regenerating species (e g., CO, etc.) mentioned herein. </p>
      <p>Any of the known scavengers of O can be included in the
        reaction system when oxygen is present in order to eliminate or
        very significantly ameliorate the oxygen effect were it a
        problem. The preferred scavenger is water which exerts its
        effect in accordance with the following equation: ##STR7## As a
        result, H atoms are regenerated without coproduction of NO. This
        permits the reaction: ##STR8## to dominate with overall loss of
        NO. </p>
      <p>Generally the molar ratio of H.sub.2 O to O.sub.2 can be in the
        range of 2-5 to 1. </p>
      <p>Under typical operating conditions of vehicular engines now in
        use, the above potential interfering effect of O.sub.2 will
        inherently be avoided also because of the inherent presence of
        H.sub.2 O in the effluent gas streams emanating from such
        engines. However, where oxygen is present and were it a problem
        and the necessary O scavenger is not inherently provided, any
        conventional means for introducing a scavenger such as water can
        be utilized. Many other scavengers can also be employed, e.g.,
        typical components of fuels utilized in engines, furnaces,
        plants, etc., including alkenes, other unsaturated hydrocarbons,
        and many other well known organic compounds. As an alternative
        to use of suitable scavengers, increased concentrations of HNCO
        can be used to reduce nitric oxide that is produced by the
        presence of oxygen were it a problem. </p>
      <p>Under operating conditions usually encountered, there should be
        no other significant interferants for the system of this
        invention, i.e., no other species which will react fast with H
        alone. In general, conditions under which high concentrations of
        such species are generated will be conditions wherein not much
        NO is generated anyway. Where NO is a problem, it is unlikely
        that species other than O.sub.2 will be interfering. Where
        species which are slow reacting with H atoms are present in high
        concentration, they will pose much more significant pollution
        problems than NO itself. </p>
      <p>As is clear from the foregoing, the method of this invention
        will be enhanced by addition to the gas stream of species which
        enhance the production and/or regeneration of H. In addition to
        the mentioned unsaturated hydrocarbons, a most preferred
        embodiment of this aspect of the invention is that shown above
        in the equation ##STR9## which as is self-evident, generates H
        free radicals. </p>
      <p>The carbon monoxide utilized in this reaction can have
        exogenous or endogenous origin. In the former case, a source of
        carbon monoxide can be added to the exhaust stream before,
        during at or after the time and/or physical location of HNCO
        addition. Any source of CO which is available will be
        applicable, especially those which are most convenient, e.g., CO
        contents of the same gas stream being treated or other gas
        streams. Of course, a commercially available CO can also be
        added where cost effective. </p>
      <p>It is also possible to modify the apparatus which is the source
        of the exhaust gas stream to operate in a manner which
        inherently provides the desirable increased amounts of CO where
        applicable. For example, an engine can be re- or de-tuned on one
        or more cylinders in such a manner that the desired level of
        increased CO production ensues. Alternatively, a secondary small
        flame or other combustion can be effected, e.g., by flaming of a
        small side stream under rich conditions, thereby producing an
        exhaust gas having increased amounts of CO which can be mixed
        with the primary effluent. The latter is especially applicable
        to systems combusting diesel and other oil-based energy sources.
        Such a secondary flame based on methane, for example, would also
        have the advantage of producing not only CO but also H.sub.2
        which further produces H atoms in the system of this invention.
        Typically, such a secondary flame running 20% rich will produce
        an exhaust stream containing on the order of 5% CO. Heat
        generated in such a secondary combustion can, of course, be
        conventionally recycled. </p>
      <p>In yet another technique, a catalyst can be placed upstream of
        the location of this invention under conditions which produce a
        reaction generating CO from the exhaust stream components. It is
        even possible to run a side stream of HNCO itself through an
        appropriate catalyst to cause generation of CO. Suitable
        catalysts, of course, are very well known and include those
        widely used in automobile anti-pollution devices. </p>
      <p>As can be seen, essentially any method of admixing CO into the
        reaction regime where the reactions of this invention are
        ongoing will be satisfactory and is included within the scope of
        this invention. Generally, it will be preferred to employ in the
        gas being treated in accordance with this invention an amount of
        CO on the order of 1500-4500 ppm, typically 2000-4000 ppm.
        However, much higher and much lower amounts of carbon monoxide
        can be utilized as well. A primary advantage of carbon monoxide
        addition is a lowering of the temperature needed for generation
        of sufficient H atoms to result in the desired NO reduction.
        Typically, for an addition of 2000-4000 ppm, there will be a
        lowering of this minimum temperature by about 250.degree. C. Of
        course, the precise correlation between the temperature lowering
        and the amount of CO added will be a function of the particular
        conditions and system involved. Where amounts of CO greater than
        4000 ppm are utilized, the temperature will be lowered to a
        greater degree; where amounts less than the preferred minimum of
        2000 ppm are utilized, the temperature lowering will be lower
        than mentioned. This temperature lowering effect of carbon
        monoxide or other hydrogen generating species (as discussed
        above and below) is a major advantage since it significantly
        lowers the minimum temperature requirements. In many systems it
        would otherwise be necessary to heat up the entire exhaust gas
        for the most efficient operation of this invention. Typically,
        by incorporating CO in accordance with this invention, the
        method can operate very well in most systems at temperatures in
        the range of 700.degree.-800.degree. C. In this sense, CO
        addition causes an effect similar to that caused by the
        catalytic surfaces mentioned above. </p>
      <p>Other hydrogen atom generating species can also be employed
        analogously to the details given above for CO. Examples include
        those mentioned above, e.g., unsaturated hydrocarbons such as
        the olefins (ethylene, propylene,. butylene, etc.) and the
        alkenes (e.g., acetylene, propyne, butyne, etc.). Saturated
        hydrocarbons are much less preferred because H atom generation
        is much less efficient and significant side product production
        ensues. Generally, where hydrocarbons are involved, the weaker
        the CH bond provided by the species the better. Weaker bonds
        provide more significant temperature lowering, i.e., require
        lower temperatures for H atom extraction by a species such as
        OH, O, etc. Thus, branched, unsaturated hydrocarbons are also
        preferred. </p>
      <p>Thus, as can be seen, the amount of CO or other H-atom
        generating means desired in a given application will
        straightforwardly vary with the desired operating temperatures.
        Where it is desired to lower the operating temperature to a
        greater degree, larger amounts of CO or other H atom generating
        species will be added and vice-versa. The same relationship also
        exists versus other reaction parameters such as residence time;
        in essence, the less necessary it is to minimize the energy
        needed for efficient NO reduction, the less necessary it will be
        to add larger amounts of CO. </p>
      <p>In essence, the amount of CO or other H-atom generating species
        can be chosen at will within the above guidelines as long as the
        amount added is not present in such large excess that it creates
        an environmental concern itself or causes such a rapid
        generation of free radicals and rapid temperature increase that
        the overall reaction becomes out of control. Of course, these
        effects can be readily avoided by routine considerations by
        skilled workers, perhaps with a few routine optimization tests
        where desired. </p>

      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>A 7.2 horsepower Onan diesel engine was utilized for the
        experiment. Its exhaust had a flow-rate of 100 l/m. A 2 l/m
        sample was introduced into a cyanuric acid sublimation chamber.
        The latter contained 50 g of cyanuric acid and the sublimation
        occurred at 350.degree. C. Thereafter, the mixture of HNCO and
        exhaust gas was passed through a furnace region packed with a
        bed of steel ball bearings. The temperature in the furnace
        region was maintained at a temperature equal to or greater than
        450.degree. C. utilizing a conventional heater. The effluent
        from the furnace region was passed into a NO.sub.x analyzer. The
        residence time in the furnace was about 1 second. </p>
      <p>The exhaust gas from the diesel engine included the usual soot,
        water, oxygen and CO.sub.2. Its 500 ppm NO content was reduced
        to less than 1 ppm (i.e., to the sensitivity level of the
        NO.sub.x analyzer). The load on the engine varied from 0.23 to
        0.8 with no effect observed on the process. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>Under the conditions of Example 1, 5 pounds of cyanuric acid
        (2.27 kg) is loaded into the holding chamber. This provides
        enough active ingredient (53 moles of HNCO) to remove
        approximately 50 moles of NO. At a typical NO concentration in a
        vehicle exhaust of 500 ppm, 2.5.times.10.sup.7 liters of gas can
        be scrubbed. This is sufficient to remove NO from the exhaust
        gas of automobiles for a driving range of approximately 1,500
        miles. </p>
      <p>The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by
        substituting the generically or specifically described reactants
        and/or operating conditions of this invention for those used in
        the preceding examples. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can
        easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this
        invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope
        thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the
        invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>An arrangement for reducing the NO content
        of a gas stream comprises contacting the gas stream with NHCO
        into a temperature effective for heat induced decomposition of
        HNCO and for resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas
        stream. Preferably, the HNCO is generated by sublimation of
        cyanuric acid. </p>
      <p><b>Description ~&nbsp; BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a new method and device for removing
        NO.sub.x from gaseous material, e.g., from exhaust gas streams.
      </p>
      <p>The recent emphasis on ecological and environmental concerns,
        especially air pollution, acid rain, photochemical smog, etc.,
        has engendered a wide variety of proposed methods for removing
        NO.sub.x, especially NO from gas streams. </p>
      <p>Certain proposed techniques involve a great deal of capital
        outlay and require major consumption of additives, scrubbers,
        etc. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,894,141 proposes a reaction
        with a liquid hydrocarbon; U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,587 proposes very
        high temperature burning with a hydrocarbon; U.S. Pat. No.
        4,448,899 proposes reaction with an iron chelate; and U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,262,751 reacts NO with a conjugated diolefin. Other
        methods utilize reactions with nitriles (U.S. Pat. No.
        4,080,425), organic N-compounds (e.g., amines or amides) (DE 33
        24 668) or pyridine (J57190638). Application of these reactions
        imposes organic pollutant disposal problems along with the
        attendant problems of toxicity and malodorous environments. In
        addition, they require the presence of oxygen and are relatively
        expensive. </p>
      <p>Other systems are based on urea reactions. For example, U.S.
        Pat. No. 4,119,702 uses a combination of urea and an oxidizing
        agent which decomposes it, e.g., ozone, nitric acid, inter alia;
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,325,924 utilizes urea in a high temperature
        reducing atmosphere; and U.S. Pat. No. 3,900,554 (the
        thermodenox system) utilizes a combination of ammonia and oxygen
        to react with nitric oxide. All of these methods must deal with
        the problem of the odor of ammonia and its disposal. All require
        oxygen or other oxidizing agents. These methods also suffer from
        the drawback of requiring controlled environments which make
        them difficult to use in mobile vehicles or smaller stationary
        devices. </p>
      <p>Japanese Publication J55051-420 does not relate to the removal
        of nitric oxide from gaseous systems, at least as reported in
        Derwent Abstract 38871C/22. It utilizes halocyanuric acid to
        remove malodorous fumes, e.g., mercaptans, sulfides, disulfides,
        ammonia or amines from gases by contact therewith followed by
        contact with activated carbon. Temperatures are reported as less
        than 80.degree. C.; classical acid/base interactions appear to
        be involved (not pyrolysis decomposition products of the
        halocyanuric acid). </p>
      <p>Back et al. Can. J. Chem. 46, 531 (1968), discusses the effect
        of NO on the photolysis of HNCO, the decomposition product of
        cyanuric acid. An increase of nitrogen concentration in the
        presence of large amounts of nitric oxide (torr levels) was
        observed utilizing a medium pressure mercury lamp for photolysis
        of HNCO. High temperature reactions were neither addressed nor
        involved; similarly, the effect, if any, of HNCO under any
        conditions on low amounts of NO (e.g., in the &lt;torr to ppm
        range) was also not addressed. In fact, the increased
        concentration of nitrogen was associated by the authors with
        high NO levels. Their theorized reactions explaining the results
        would be important only at high NO levels. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, use of cyanuric acid as a source of isocyanic acid
        (HNCO) for purposes of studying various properties of the latter
        or its subsequent degradation products is also known. See, e.g.,
        Okabe, J. Chem. Phys., 53, 3507 (1970) and Perry, J. Chem.
        Phys., 82, 5485 (1985). J.P. 53-28771 discloses the addition of
        relatively large particles (0.1-10 mm, preferably 0.5-5.0 mm) of
        cyanuric acid at temperatures generically disclosed as
        600.degree.-1500.degree. C., but preferably at high temperatures
        of 1200.degree.-1300.degree. C., for removal of NO.sub.x from
        exhaust gas. The theory of operation disclosed in this
        publication appears to involve a reaction occurring on the
        surface of the particle which leads to the requirements of the
        high particle size and high temperature. It is explicitly stated
        in the publication that, "If the diameter of the granule is too
        small, the efficiency goes down." There is no suggestion in this
        publication that the active species effecting the treatment of
        the exhaust gas is itself gaseous and certainly no suggestion
        that the gaseous species is HNCO. As a result, the conditions
        disclosed in this reference lead away from those which are most
        applicable to a reaction of NO.sub.x with gaseous HNCO.
        Consequentially, the process of this reference is believed not
        to have been used on a technical scale. </p>
      <p>As a result, there continues to be a need for a simple,
        relatively inexpensive, non-polluting, non-toxic non-malodorous
        and regenerable system, method and device for removing nitric
        oxide from gas streams. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide such
        a system, method and device. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide such a
        method, system and device which is applicable to small
        stationary devices, mobile vehicles, as well as to larger
        applications, including smokestacks from plants, furnaces,
        manufacturing factories, kilns, vehicles, and essentially any
        other source of exhaust gas containing NO, particularly
        industrial gases. </p>
      <p>Upon further study of the specification and appended claims,
        further objects and advantages of this invention will become
        apparent to those skilled in the art. </p>
      <p>These objects have been attained by this invention by providing
        a method of reducing the NO content of a gas stream comprising
        contacting the gas stream with HNCO at a temperature effective
        for heat induced decomposition of HNCO and for resultant
        lowering of the NO content of the gas stream. It is preferred
        that the HNCO be generated by sublimation of cyanuric acid. </p>
      <p>In another aspect, these objects have been achieved by
        providing a device useful for reducing the NO content of a gas
        stream comprising: </p>
      <p>means for storing a compound which upon sublimation generates
        HNCO; </p>
      <p>means for subliming said compound in operation; </p>
      <p>means for contacting said NO-containing gas stream with said
        generated HNCO; and </p>
      <p>means for raising the temperature of said gas contacted with
        HNCO to a level effective for heat induced decomposition of HNCO
        and resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas stream. </p>
      <p>In yet another aspect, these objects have been achieved by
        providing in a conduit means for an effluent gas stream
        containing NO, the improvement wherein the conduit means further
        comprises device means for lowering the NO content of said gas,
        said device means comprising: </p>
      <p>compartment means for storing a compound which upon sublimation
        generates HNCO; </p>
      <p>means for heating said compound to a temperature at which it
        sublimes; </p>
      <p>means for contacting said NO-containing gas stream with said
        generated HNCO; and </p>
      <p>means for raising the temperature of said HNCO-contacted gas
        stream to a level effective for heat induced decomposition of
        HNCO and resultant lowering of the NO content of the gas stream.
      </p>
      <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
      <p>Various other objects, features and attendant advantages of the
        present invention will be more fully appreciated as the same
        comes better understood when considered in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, in which like reference characters
        designate the same or similar parts throughout the several
        views, and wherein: </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 schematically illustrates one possible configuration for
        carrying out the method of this invention and for configuring
        the device and/or improved conduit of this invention. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DISCUSSION</b> </p>
      <p>This invention provides many significant advantages over other
        theoretical and/or commercially available NO reducers. It is
        generically applicable to all industrial gas effluent streams,
        e.g., those mentioned in the references discussed above. It is
        very simple, inexpensive and portable. It does not require the
        use of catalysts and/or co-agents. In addition, when the
        preferred source of HNCO (cyanuric acid) is spent during
        operation, it can be simply and inexpensively replaced. It
        provides heretofore unachievable convenience and efficiency in
        reducing NO. Its non-toxicity is another major advantage as its
        ready availability and low cost. </p>
      <p>As opposed to many of the other systems now available, that of
        this invention imposes minimal changes in otherwise preferred
        operating conditions for the engine, plant, factory, etc., which
        generates the effluent gas stream being purified. For example,
        as opposed to presently utilized catalytic converters, this
        invention does not impose a requirement that a vehicular engine
        be run rich with resultant undesirable lower compression ratios.
        In addition, the requirement for use of unleaded gas in order to
        avoid catalyst poisoning also does not apply. Overall, the
        efficacy of the system of this invention in lowering NO contents
        is extremely high. </p>
      <p>Within the broadest scope of this invention, any source and/or
        means of generating HNCO and admixing it with the effluent
        stream can be used. For a variety of reasons including those
        discussed above, in the preferred embodiment, sublimation of
        cyanuric acid will be utilized: ##STR1## </p>
      <p>Isocyanuric acid is a tautomer of cyanuric acid. For purposes
        of this invention, the two are equivalent. The sublimation of
        cyanuric acid in accordance with the following equation,
        ##STR2## can be conducted at any temperature effective to cause
        a volatilization of sufficient HNCO for the desired purpose. In
        general, temperatures greater than 300.degree. C. will be
        utilized since sublimation rates at lower temperatures are
        generally too low. Preferably, temperatures greater than
        320.degree. C. will be used, especially greater than 350.degree.
        C. There is no preferred upper limit on temperature; but
        generally a temperature less than about 1200 C. will be
        employed. The precise temperature for a given application can be
        routinely selected, perhaps with a few orientation experiments,
        in conjunction with considerations of the volume to be filled,
        the flow rate of the gas, the resultant residence time of the
        admixture of HNCO and NO is the effluent gas stream, the surface
        area of the HNCO source which is being sublimed and the
        sublimation rate which ensues in a given system upon selection
        of the given temperature. For example, for 50 g of a cyanuric
        acid sample having a surface area of about 20 cm.sup.2, the
        sublimation rate achieved at a temperature of 450.degree. C. is
        sufficient to reduce the NO level from a 50 l/m gas stream from
        1000 ppm to essentially 0 ppm. </p>
      <p>While cyanuric acid itself is the preferred source of HNCO,
        other sublimable solids can also be used for its generation.
        These include other compounds which are typical impurities in
        samples of cyanuric acid, including ammelide and ammeline
        ##STR3## In general, cyanuric acid wherein the OH groups are
        replaced by 1-3 NH.sub.2, alkyl, NH-alkyl or N-alkyl.sub.2
        groups, are utilizable. Such alkyl groups typically will have
        1-4 carbon atoms. </p>
      <p>Also utilizable are oligomers of HNCO which are linear rather
        than cyclic as in cyanuric acid. For example, cyamelide is
        particularly noteworthy. Also utilizable are the known
        halocyanuric acids such as the mono-, di- or tri-chloro, bromo,
        fluoro or iodo acids or other various mixed-halo substituted
        acids. </p>
      <p>Any means or technique which results in admixture of HNCO with
        the NO-containing gas is included within the scope of this
        invention. For example, if the effluent gas stream itself is at
        a sufficiently elevated temperature, it can be directly passed
        over a solid sample of the HNCO source to effect sublimation and
        instantaneous admixture. It is also possible to incorporate the
        solid HNCO source into a solvent therefor, most preferably hot
        water, and conventionally spray or inject the solution into the
        effluent gas stream. Of course, it is also possible to use
        conventional heating means (e.g., conductive, inductive, etc.)
        to heat the sublimable source of HNCO and then to conventionally
        conduct the resultant HNCO gas into admixture with the effluent
        stream. Steam injection preceded by passage of the steam over,
        through, etc., the HNCO source such as cyanuric acid can, of
        course, also be utilized. </p>
      <p>It is also possible to indirectly admix the HNCO with the
        effluent gas stream. For example, if the HNCO is injected into
        the combustion chamber which produces the effluent gas stream or
        if the sublimable source such as cyanuric acid is so injected,
        the HNCO will be incorporated into the effluent gas stream at
        its point of generation. As long as the necessary reaction
        conditions are maintained for subsequent interaction of the HNCO
        with the NO in the gas stream, the NO reduction method of this
        invention will be accomplished. The latter option pertains to
        any system which generates an NO-containing stream, including
        vehicular engines (wherein the injection of cyanuric acid or
        HNCO can be accomplished via the conventional valves), furnaces,
        plants, etc. Alternatively, the admixture can be effected
        directly either downstream from the point of generation of the
        effluent gas or directly near or at this point, e.g., right at
        the head of the vehicular engine where the heat generated by the
        latter can be utilized, not only for sublimation of the solid
        source of HNCO, but also for effecting the NO reducing reactions
        based on the presence of HNCO. </p>
      <p>The NO content of the effluent streams into which the HNCO has
        been admixed will be lowered as long as the temperature of the
        effluent stream is raised to a level at which HNCO thermally
        decomposes into products which result in lowering of the NO
        content. However, there will be an upper limit beyond which the
        nature of the predominant reactions ensuing from the
        decomposition of HNCO will change in such a fashion that the
        desired reduction in NO.sub.x will not occur. At elevated
        temperatures, greater than 1200.degree. C., the presence of
        oxygen will make the production of nitric oxide un-acceptable.
        Thus, the temperature at which the decrease in the effectiveness
        of this invention will occur is on the order of 1200.degree. C.
        and higher. </p>
      <p>More generally, the preferred upper limit on the temperature
        will be less than 1200.degree. C. (e.g., less than 1190) in
        dependence on the usual factors, including diameter of the
        effluent stream, its velocity, the particle size of the added
        HNCO-generating agent where applicable, the gas or particle
        injection technique and configuration, the residence time of the
        reaction, e.g., the length available for the reaction, the
        involved concentrations and amounts of NO.sub.x and agent of
        this invention, etc. Thus, in dependence on such factors, the
        upper limit can encompass a wide variety of values on the order
        of the mentioned "less than 1200.degree. C.", e.g., less than
        values such as 1195, 1190, 1175, 1150, 1125, 1100, 1075, 1050,
        1025, 1000, 975, 950, etc. Typically, the upper limit will fall
        in the range of 1100.degree.-1200.degree. C. or higher. This
        relatively lower temperature regime is one aspect of the present
        invention which clearly distinguishes it from the treatment of
        JP 54-28771. </p>
      <p>The preferred temperature of operation for a given system will
        again vary with the usual considerations such as those mentioned
        above. Typically, the higher available temperatures will be
        preferred because of the more favorable reaction kinetics
        associated therewith. Thus, reactions will often preferably be
        conducted in the range of 700.degree.-1100.degree. C., more
        preferably 900.degree.-1050.degree. C., especially
        850.degree.-1000.degree. C. One of the major advantages of this
        invention is that the reaction, once initiated, will continue to
        occur to a substantial degree at significantly lower
        temperatures, i.e., from the sublimation point of the solid
        agent such as cyanuric acid up to these preferred temperatures.
        Thus, the reaction will ensue substantively at temperatures such
        as about 350.degree.-700.degree. C. or even lower, e.g., at
        temperatures of 400.degree.-700.degree. C. or
        450.degree.-600.degree. C. or temperatures less than 600.degree.
        C. For example, temperatures on the order of about 400.degree.
        C. will often suffice where residence times are greater than or
        equal to about one second. For prior art systems, including the
        prior art system of JP 54-28771, by implication, substantial
        reduction of NO.sub.x at temperatures lower than the high
        temperatures typically required (e.g., less than about
        900.degree. C. for ammonia injection) does not occur. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, for this invention, even when an exhaust gas
        stream reaches a low temperature, e.g., less than 600.degree.
        C., substantial reduction of NO.sub.x in accordance with this
        invention will continue to occur. This represents a major
        advantage since exhaust gas streams inevitably cool during their
        passage from the point of generation. Thus, in those common
        situations where not all of the NO.sub.x is removed during the
        time that the exhaust gas stream is at the requisite high
        temperature of the prior art, this invention will continue to
        provide NO.sub.x reduction. This invention represents a very
        efficient technique both at temperatures greater than
        600.degree. C., e.g., 601.degree. C. to the upper limit
        discussed above and also at temperatures less than 600.degree.
        C., e.g., at temperatures from the lower limit discussed above
        up to 599.degree. C. </p>
      <p>Thus, in one unique aspect of this invention, there is provided
        a method for at least partially decreasing the concentration of
        NO.sub.x in an exhaust gas stream at a temperature less than
        600.degree. C., e.g., at a temperature less than or equal to
        590.degree. C., 570.degree. C., 550.degree. C., 500.degree. C.,
        450.degree. C., 400.degree. C., etc. </p>
      <p>The amount of NO.sub.x reduction which might occur at such
        heretofore inoperable, low temperatures will be a function of
        the usual parameters (see above) including the highest available
        temperature upstream, the residence time upstream, the NO.sub.x
        initial concentration, etc. </p>
      <p>The temperature at which the HNCO or HNCO-generating solid is
        added to the exhaust gas stream will also be a function of the
        usual parameters including those mentioned above. Typically, it
        will be desired to achieve the HNCO presence at as high a
        temperature as possible within the constraints mentioned above
        and the availability of suitable energy. Since a free radical
        mechanism is involved, a suitably high initiation temperature
        will more quickly achieve a sufficiently high concentration of
        radicals to cause rapid achievement of an adequately high
        concentration of the active species to correspondingly quickly
        commence NO.sub.x reduction. Once free radical initiation
        ensues, the preference for high reaction tempertures will be
        lowered in accordance with the foregoing. </p>
      <p>Another consequence of the discovery of this invention that
        HNCO is the active species, i.e., that the active species is
        itself gaseous in nature under the relevant conditions, is that
        certain particle size ranges will be preferred when the HNCO is
        not added directly to the gas stream as a gas, i.e., is added in
        the form of a solid which produces HNCO, e.g., a sublimable
        solid such as cyanuric acid. The basic principle is to produce
        the active gaseous species as quickly and efficiently as
        possible. Typically, the smaller the particle size the better,
        taking into account the usual engineering considerations.
        Preferably, the average particle size will be less than 100
        microns, e.g., less than or equal to about 95, or 90, or 80, or
        70, or 60, or 50, or 40, or 30, or 20, or 10, etc. Typically,
        the preferred particle sizes will be in the range of 1 to less
        than 100 microns, most preferably in the range of from 10 to
        less than 100 microns. The precise particle size range preferred
        for a given application will be a function of the usual
        considerations including system temperature, exhaust stream
        diameter, available residence times, the efficiency and
        configuration of the injection system, etc. </p>
      <p>As is well known, for smaller diameter streams, e.g., those
        typically encountered in vehicular systems, direct admixture of
        gaseous HNCO to the exhaust gas stream is typically preferred;
        for larger cross-section systems such as those encountered in
        typical smokestack exhausts, it is difficult to achieve adequate
        gas-gas mixing in the available times whereupon injection or
        other addition of particles is the preferred mode. It is also
        possible to inject a combination of particles and gaseous HNCO,
        e.g., by employing an injection configuration which provides the
        possibility for preheating the particles to be injected in a
        chamber whereupon both gaseous HNCO and solid material are
        introduced directly into the exhaust gas system. This also
        enhances the initiation of the reaction for the reasons
        discussed above. In a related embodiment, it is also preferred
        to include in the injection material (particles, gas or a
        mixture thereof), HNCO generating substances which have a
        particularly favorable decomposition profile such as ammeline. </p>
      <p>Except as indicated otherwise herein, details of the mixing of
        the exhaust gas stream with solid particles or directly with
        gaseous HNCO will be in accordance with the usual conventional
        considerations as discussed thoroughly in the literature, e.g,
        in Combustion and Mass Transfer, D. Bryan Spalding, Pergammon
        Press 1979. </p>
      <p>As discussed above, the preferred technique is addition of
        gaseous HNCO directly to the exhaust gas stream or addition of
        particles having diameters as discussed above. In other
        preferred aspects, the solid material can be added in the form
        of a solution in a solvent preferably hot water or as a slurry
        in an appropriate liquid, also preferably water, i.e., at a
        temperature where the solid agent is not fully dissolved. Other
        suitable solvents or dispersing fluids, e.g., liquid CO.sub.2,
        N.sub.2, etc., of course can also be used. These aspects provide
        ease of handling via conventional pumps. </p>
      <p>Thus, for example, cyanuric acid can be dissolved in high
        temperature, high pressure water, especially in power plant
        environments where saturated water/steam is readily available,
        e.g., typically at 180.degree. C. (150 psi). Solid or slurry
        injection can, for example, be accomplished by the use of a lead
        screw connecting the exhaust stream with the powder or slurry
        reservoir of the solid agent such as cyanuric acid. Steam
        injection is also preferred. Particle size considerations in
        such slurries will be in accordance with the foregoing. Where
        direct injection of gaseous HNCO is employed, it will be
        preferred to use a heated pre-chamber to avoid occasional
        plugging of metering devices where this may be a problem, e.g.,
        due to polymerization of HNCO on cold surfaces. </p>
      <p>As can be seen from the foregoing, this invention involves the
        discovery that HNCO can be used to very efficiently remove
        NO.sub.x from exhaust gas streams under conditions where the
        reaction with NO.sub.x occurs substantially solely in the gas
        phase with HNCO and not on the surfaces of particles of
        substances which can optionally be used to generate the HNCO.
        Accordingly, contrary to the disclosure of JP 54-28771, the
        conditions are to be chosen in order to facilitate the
        sublimation or other conversion of substantially all of such
        solid particles into gaseous HNCO before and/or during the
        reaction(s) which is effective to lower the NO.sub.x
        concentration. </p>
      <p>In a further feature of this invention, it has been discovered
        that the underlying process is relatively insensitive to prior
        art interferants including particulates such as fly ash and
        oxygen. Because of its unique features, it is especially
        advantageously applicable to systems which heretofore have
        presented a relatively severe NO.sub.x problem such as systems
        based on diesel or coal combustion, e.g., boilers, smokestack
        exhausts, etc. </p>
      <p>Pressure is typically not a critical variable under all
        realistic applications. Thus, pressures in the range from about
        0.1-10 atmospheres as well as lower or higher values are
        employable. </p>
      <p>The relative amounts of NO or HNCO are not critical. Typically,
        the system will be designed so that approximately stoichiometric
        amounts are employed. Of course, excesses of either ingredient
        can be designed where desirable. In many applications, it will
        be desired to utilize very slight, environmentally acceptable
        excesses of NO in order to avoid excesses of HNCO. The latter is
        an acid which might recyclize to cyanuric acid at the low
        temperatures ensuing after the reaction has run its course.
        Thus, since the excess of NO can be chosen to be benignly low in
        view of the great efficacy of this invention in reducing NO
        contents, and since the products of the overall NO-reduction
        reactions are nitrogen, carbon dioxide, water and carbon
        monoxide (with a minor component of CO), the resultant system
        containing benign amounts of NO will cause no environmental
        concerns. Of course, where otherwise desirable, the system can
        also be run with slight excesses of HNCO. Where excesses are
        employed of either ingredient, these can, e.g., be in the range
        of about 1.01 to about 1.1 or more on a stoichiometric basis.
        However, it also will often be desirable to use larger excesses
        of HNCO to ensure the optimum NO.sub.x removed, e.g., molar
        equivalent excesses in the range of 1.1-10/1, typically less
        than 5/1, 4/1, 3/1, 2/1, etc., or generally in the range of 1/1
        to 5/1, etc. </p>
      <p>In a preferred mode of operation of this invention, the NO
        reduction reactions will be conducted in the presence of
        surfaces which act as a catalyst for the free radical reactions
        which effect the NO reduction. The nature of the surface is not
        critical as long as it is catalytically effective, metallic or
        otherwise. All those surfaces well known to catalyze related
        free radical reactions will be employable, e.g., metallic
        surfaces, oxides, etc. For metallic systems, preferably, the
        metal component will be iron which will typically be provided by
        the steel, stainless steel, or other iron-based surfaces
        utilized in plants, vehicles, factories, etc., and especially
        utilized in the conduits containing effluent gas streams, e.g.,
        mufflers, smokestacks, etc. Other typical metals include the
        usual transition metals, e.g., the noble metals, including
        platinum, palladium, rhodium, silver, gold, etc. as well as
        nickel, cobalt, chromium, manganese, vanadium, titanium, etc. In
        a further preferred embodiment, the reaction will be conducted
        in a chamber containing particles of such catalytic surfaces,
        e.g., pellets, beads, granules, etc. The particle sizes and
        distributions are not critical. As usual, the greater the
        surface area, the more efficient this effect will be. Where
        catalytic surfaces are utilized, residence times can be shorter
        and temperatures can be lower under otherwise identical
        conditions. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is felt
        that the catalytic effect is primarily exerted in initiating the
        generation of free radicals triggering chain reactions necessary
        for the NO reduction. </p>
      <p>Other components may also be present in the NO-containing
        stream without adversely impacting this invention. For example,
        where NO.sub.2 is involved, it also will be removed by this
        invention. However, under the normal conditions where NO is a
        problem, NO.sub.2 often is not a problem. The amount of NO in
        the effluent gas stream also is not critical. Typically, the
        amounts will be 1 ppm or more, e.g., 1-10,000 ppm or 10-5,000
        ppm, typically 100-1,000 ppm, etc. By routine, judicious
        selection of reaction conditions as described above, the amount
        of NO after admixture with HNCO can be reduced to any desired
        low level, including 0 ppm within limits of detection. Greater
        reductions in NO contents in a given system can be achieved by
        utilizing longer residence times and higher temperatures. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a system of this
        invention. The overall "device" 1 simply comprises means such as
        chamber 2 for holding the sublimable compound; means for heating
        the latter to its sublimation temperature, e.g., in FIG. 1 the
        means simply being the input gas stream 3 which is at an
        elevated temperature; means for contacting the resultant HNCO
        with the input stream, which here simply comprises the adjoining
        conduits whereby the input stream heats the cyanuric acid and
        the resultant HNCO is instantaneously mixed with the input
        stream; and means for conducting the reaction, here illustrated
        by furnace 4. Many other equivalents will be very clear to
        skilled workers. For example, one or both of the storage chamber
        and the furnace can be inductively, conductively, radiatively,
        etc., heated using external sources other than the input stream
        itself. One or both of storage chamber and furnace region can be
        located anywhere along the path of the effluent stream, e.g.,
        they can be located right at the head of an engine or the
        exhaust outlet of a furnace or plant. As discussed above, it is
        even possible for the storage means to be located upstream of
        the chamber which produces the effluent stream where this is
        practical. Conventional heat exchange means can also be
        incorporated into the system wherever desirable. In FIG. 1, the
        heat exchange means is the input gas itself. </p>
      <p>Without wishing to be bound by theory, the following is a
        proposed mechanism for the NO reduction system: ##STR4## </p>
      <p>As can be seen, free radicals are generated which cause chain
        reactions to ensue. This explains both the speed and high
        efficiency of the system in removing NO from the gas stream. The
        reaction mechanism is highly surprising since the weakest bond
        in the HNCO molecule has a strength of about 85 kcal whereupon
        it would have been expected that a much higher temperature than
        those in the range of 400.degree.-800.degree. C. would be
        necessary for a significant effect based on decomposition of
        HNCO. </p>
      <p>This mode of action also serves to further clarify the
        distinction between this invention and the more conventional
        chemistry known for HNCO, e.g., that is described in Back et
        al., supra. In the latter, no elevated temperatures were used;
        only a purely photolytic decomposition of HNCO was effected. In
        addition, the lowering of NO content mentioned in this reference
        related only to relatively high pressures of NO in the several
        torr range. </p>
      <p>Without further elaboration, it is believed that one skilled in
        the art can, using the preceding description; utilize the
        present invention to its fullest extent. The following preferred
        specific embodiments are, therefore, to be construed as merely
        illustrative, and not limitative of the remainder of the
        disclosure in any way whatsoever. </p>
      <p>In the foregoing and in the following example, all temperatures
        are set forth uncorrected in degrees Celsius and unless
        otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by volume. </p>
      <p>The entire text of all applications, patents and publications,
        if any, cited above and below are hereby incorporated by
        reference. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>A 7.2 horsepower Onan diesel engine was utilized for the
        experiment. Its exhaust had a flow-rate of 100 l/m. A 2 l/m
        sample was introduced into a cyanuric acid sublimation chamber.
        The latter contained 50 g of cyanuric acid and the sublimation
        occurred at 350.degree. C. Thereafter, the mixture of HNCO and
        exhaust gas was passed through a furnace region packed with a
        bed of steel ball bearings. The temperature in the furnace
        region was maintained at a temperature equal to or greater than
        450.degree. C. utilizing a conventional heater. The effluent
        from the furnace region was passed into a NO.sub.x analyzer. The
        residence time in the furnace was about 1 second. </p>
      <p>The exhaust gas from the diesel engine included the usual soot,
        water, oxygen and CO.sub.2. Its 500 ppm NO content was reduced
        to less than 1 ppm (i.e., to the sensitivity level of the
        NO.sub.x analyzer). The load on the engine varied from 0.23 to
        0.8 with no effect observed on the process. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>Under the conditions of Example 1, 5 pounds of cyanuric acid
        (2.27 kg) is loaded into the holding chamber. This provides
        enough active ingredient (53 moles of HNCO) to remove
        approximately 50 moles of NO. At a typical NO concentration in a
        vehicle exhaust of 500 ppm, 2.5.times.10.sup.7 liters of gas can
        be scrubbed. This is sufficient to remove NO from the exhaust
        gas of automobiles for a driving range of approximately 1,500
        miles. </p>
      <p>The preceding examples can be repeated with similar success by
        substituting the generically or specifically described reactants
        and/or operating conditions of this invention for those used in
        the preceding examples. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can
        easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this
        invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope
        thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the
        invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. </p>
