      <br>
      ZURICH - 22 Apr 2013: Today on Earth Day, scientists have
      announced a collaboration to develop an affordable photovoltaic
      system capable of concentrating solar radiation 2,000 times and
      converting 80 percent of the incoming radiation into useful
      energy. The system can also provide desalinated water and cool air
      in sunny, remote locations where they are often in short supply.<br>
      <br>
      A three-year, $2.4 million (2.25 million CHF) grant from the Swiss
      Commission for Technology and Innovation has been awarded to
      scientists at IBM Research (NYSE: IBM); Airlight Energy, a
      supplier of solar power technology; ETH Zurich (Professorship of
      Renewable Energy Carriers) and Interstate University of Applied
      Sciences Buchs NTB (Institute for Micro- and Nanotechnology MNT)
      to research and develop an economical High Concentration
      PhotoVoltaic Thermal (HCPVT) system. <br>
      <br>
      Based on a study by the European Solar Thermal Electricity
      Association and Greenpeace International, technically, it would
      only take two percent of the solar energy from the Sahara Desert
      to supply the world's electricity needs*. Unfortunately, current
      solar technologies on the market today are too expensive and slow
      to produce, require rare Earth minerals and lack the efficiency to
      make such massive installations practical. <br>
      <br>
      The prototype HCPVT system uses a large parabolic dish, made from
      a multitude of mirror facets, which are attached to a sun tracking
      system. The tracking system positions the dish at the best angle
      to capture the sun's rays, which then reflect off the mirrors onto
      several microchannel-liquid cooled receivers with triple junction
      photovoltaic chips -- each 1x1 centimeter chip can convert 50
      watts, on average, over a typical eight hour day in a sunny
      region. <br>
      <br>
      The entire receiver combines hundreds of chips and provides 25
      kilowatts of electrical power. The photovoltaic chips are mounted
      on micro-structured layers that pipe liquid coolants within a few
      tens of micrometers off the chip to absorb the heat and draw it
      away 10 times more effectively than with passive air cooling. <br>
      <br>
      The coolant maintains the chips almost at the same temperature for
      a solar concentration of 2,000 times and can keep them at safe
      temperatures up to a solar concentration of 5,000 times. <br>
      <br>
      The direct cooling solution with very small pumping power is
      inspired by the hierarchical branched blood supply system of the
      human body and has been already tested by IBM scientists in high
      performance computers, including Aquasar. An initial demonstrator
      of the multi-chip receiver was developed in a previous
      collaboration between IBM and the Egypt Nanotechnology Research
      Center. <br>
      <br>
      "We plan to use triple-junction photovoltaic cells on a
      micro-channel cooled module which can directly convert more than
      30 percent of collected solar radiation into electrical energy and
      allow for the efficient recovery of an additional 50 percent waste
      heat," said Bruno Michel, manager, advanced thermal packaging at
      IBM Research. "We believe that we can achieve this with a very
      practical design that is made of lightweight and high strength
      concrete, which is used in bridges, and primary optics composed of
      inexpensive pneumatic mirrors -- it's frugal innovation, but
      builds on decades of experience in microtechnology. <br>
      <br>
      "The design of the system is elegantly simple," said Andrea
      Pedretti, chief technology officer at Airlight Energy. "We replace
      expensive steel and glass with low cost concrete and simple
      pressurized metalized foils. The small high-tech components, in
      particular the microchannel coolers and the molds, can be
      manufactured in Switzerland with the remaining construction and
      assembly done in the region of the installation. This leads to a
      win-win situation where the system is cost competitive and jobs
      are created in both regions." <br>
      <br>
      The solar concentrating optics will be developed by ETH Zurich.
      "Advanced ray-tracing numerical techniques will be applied to
      optimize the design of the optical configuration and reach uniform
      solar fluxes exceeding 2,000 suns at the surface of the
      photovoltaic cell," said Aldo Steinfeld, Professor at ETH Zurich.
      <br>
      <br>
      With such a high concentration and a radically low cost design
      scientists believe they can achieve a cost per aperture area below
      $250 per square meter, which is three times lower than comparable
      systems. The levelized cost of energy will be less than 10 cents
      per kilowatt hour (KWh). For comparison, feed in tariffs for
      electrical energy in Germany are currently still larger than 25
      cents per KWh and production cost at coal power stations are
      around 5-10 cents per KWh.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water Desalination and Cool Air</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Current concentration photovoltaic systems only collect electrical
      energy and dissipate the thermal energy to the atmosphere. With
      the HCPVT packaging approach scientists can both eliminate the
      overheating problems of solar chips while also repurposing the
      energy for thermal water desalination and adsorption cooling. <br>
      <br>
      To capture the medium grade heat IBM scientists and engineers are
      utilizing an advanced technology they developed for water-cooled
      high performance computers, including Aquasar and SuperMUC. With
      both computers water is used to absorb heat from the processor
      chips, which is then used to provide space heating for the
      facilities. <br>
      <br>
      "Microtechnology as known from computer chip manufacturing is
      crucial to enable such an efficient thermal transfer from the
      photovoltaic chip over to the cooling liquid," said Andre Bernard,
      head of the MNT Institute at NTB Buchs. "And by using innovative
      ways to fabricate these heat transfer devices we aim at a
      cost-efficient production." <br>
      <br>
      In the HCPVT system, instead of heating a building, the 90 degree
      Celsius water will be used to heat salty water that then passes
      through a porous membrane distillation system where it is
      vaporized and desalinated. Such a system could provide 30-40
      liters of drinkable water per square meter of receiver area per
      day, while still generating electricity with a more than 25
      percent yield or two kilowatt hours per day -- a little less than
      half the amount of water the average person needs per day
      according to the United Nations**, but a large installation could
      provide enough water for a town. <br>
      <br>
      Remarkably, the HCPVT system can also provide air conditioning by
      means of a thermal driven adsorption chiller. An adsorption
      chiller is a device that converts heat into cooling via a thermal
      cycle applied to an absorber made from silica gel, for example.
      Adsorption chillers, with water as working fluid, can replace
      compression chillers, which stress electrical grids in hot
      climates and contain working fluids that are harmful to the ozone
      layer. <br>
      <br>
      Scientists envision the HCPVT system providing sustainable energy
      and potable water to locations around the world including southern
      Europe, Africa, Arabic peninsula, the southwestern part of the
      United States, South America, and Australia. Remote tourism
      locations are also an interesting market, particularly resorts on
      small islands, such as the Maldives, Seychelles and Mauritius,
      since conventional systems require separate units, with consequent
      loss in efficiency and increased cost. <br>
      <br>
      A prototype of the HCPVT system is currently being tested at IBM
      Research - Zurich. Additional prototypes will be built in Biasca
      and Rueschlikon, Switzerland as part of the collaboration. <br>

      energy from the sun. His hope is that this technique will prove to

      A method is disclosed for operating a photovoltaic thermal hybrid
      system having a hybrid solar receiver with a photovoltaic module,
      operatively coupled to the system to deliver an electrical output
      power for a power user, a thermal collector distinct from the

      mechanism to move the photovoltaic module and/or the thermal
      collector to change a ratio of an intensity of radiation received
      at the photovoltaic module to an intensity of radiation received
      at the thermal collector.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention generally relates to photovoltaic
      thermal hybrid solar systems and methods of operation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Definitions of certain terms discussed herein are as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Photovoltaics (PV) generate electrical power by converting
      solar radiation into direct current electricity through
      semiconductors exhibiting the photovoltaic effect;<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A photovoltaic cell (or PV cell, also "solar cell" or
      "photoelectric cell") is a solid state device that converts energy
      of light directly into electricity by virtue if the photovoltaic
      effect;<br>
      <br>
      [0006] A photovoltaic module (also "solar module", "solar panel"
      or "photovoltaic panel") is an assembly of connected photovoltaic
      cells;<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of
      photovoltaic modules, an inverter and interconnection wiring;<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A thermal collector (also "solar thermal collector")
      collects heat by absorbing radiations, such as sunlight;<br>
      <br>
      [0009] A heat exchanger is a device/piece of equipment to
      efficiently transfer heat from one medium to another;<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In electronic systems, a heat sink is a component to cool a
      device by dissipating heat into a surrounding medium;<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Solar thermal energy (STE) concerns technologies for
      harnessing solar energy for thermal energy (heat). STE differs
      from and is acknowledged to be much more efficient than
      photovoltaics, which converts solar energy directly into
      electricity;<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Concentrated solar power (also "concentrating solar power"
      or CSP) systems use mirrors or lenses that concentrate a large
      area of solar thermal energy onto a small area, such that
      electrical power (also "power") can be produced when concentrated
      light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (e.g., a
      steam turbine) connected to a power generator. Common forms of
      concentration are: parabolic trough, dish Stirlings, concentrating
      linear Fresnel reflector and solar power tower.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) systems use optics (e.g.,
      lenses) to concentrate a large amount of sunlight onto a small
      area of solar photovoltaic materials to generate electricity.
      Concentration allows for production of smaller areas of solar
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] CPV should not to be confused with CSP: in CSP concentrated
      sunlight is converted to heat, and then heat is converted to
      electricity, whereas in CPV concentrated sunlight is converted
      directly to electricity using the photovoltaic effect;<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors (also "hybrid
      PV/T systems" or PVT) are systems converting solar radiation into
      thermal and electrical energy. Such systems combine a photovoltaic
      cell, which converts photons into electricity, with a solar
      thermal collector, which captures the remaining energy and removes
      waste heat from the PV module. Two categories of PVT collectors
      are generally known:<br>
      <br>
      [0016] PV/T fluid collector (air or liquid). In liquid collectors,
      a typical water-cooled design uses conductive-metal piping or
      plates attached to the back of a PV module. The working fluid is
      typically water or glycol. The heat from the PV cells are
      conducted through the metal and absorbed by the working fluid,
      which assumes that the working fluid is cooler than the operating
      temperature of the cells. In closed-loop systems this heat is
      either exhausted (to cool it) or transferred at a heat exchanger,
      where it flows to its application. In open-loop systems, this heat
      is used, or exhausted before the fluid returns to the PV cells;<br>
      <br>
      [0017] PV/T concentrator (CPVT), wherein a concentrating system is
      provided to reduce the amount of solar cells needed. CPVT can
      reach very good solar thermal performance compared to flat PV/T
      collectors. However, main obstacles to CPVT are to provide good
      cooling of the solar cells and a durable tracking system.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A disadvantage of PV systems compared to other energy
      sources is the unpredictable nature of the direct solar radiation.
      This leads to intermittent power delivery, which has much less
      value than on demand power and leads to grid instabilities.
      Storage of electrical energy in e.g. batteries is prohibitively
      expensive so that the cost for a storage unit for a full day
      production costs much more than the solar power station.
      Concentrated solar power systems (CSP) that can store the
      collected heat can produce electricity on demand until the stored
      heat is dissipated. Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) power plants
      have higher conversion efficiencies than PV and CSP but still
      suffer from intermittent power production. Concentrated
      photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) systems have a higher system
      efficiency because of the improved cooling but reject the heat to
      the ambient or produce low grade heat with limited utility.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] According to a first aspect, a method of operating a
      photovoltaic thermal hybrid system is disclosed, the latter
      comprising a hybrid solar receiver, having a photovoltaic module,
      operatively coupled to the system to deliver an electrical output
      power for a power user; and a thermal collector distinct from the
      photovoltaic module, wherein the photovoltaic module and/or the
      thermal collector are movably mounted in the system; and a
      collector thermal storage thermally connected to the thermal
      collector to store heat collected at the thermal collector; and
      positioning mechanism adapted to move the photovoltaic module
      and/or the thermal collector. The method includes: instructing the
      positioning mechanism to move the photovoltaic module and/or the
      thermal collector to change a ratio of an intensity of radiation
      received at the photovoltaic module to an intensity of radiation
      received at the thermal collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the
      following features: the method further includes receiving data
      indicative of an electrical power demand; and instructing the
      positioning mechanism is carried out based on a comparison of the
      output power with the power demand; instructing the positioning
      mechanism includes instructing the positioning mechanism to move
      the photovoltaic module and/or the thermal collector to decrease
      the ratio if the comparison indicates that the output power is
      larger than the power demand; the method further includes
      instructing to deliver an output power generated by the
      photovoltaic module to a power user, to meet the power demand if
      the output power matches the power demand. The system further
      includes a heat engine, thermally connected to the collector
      thermal storage, the method further comprising instructing the
      heat engine to start a process of thermal-to-electrical conversion
      of heat stored in the collector thermal storage if an output power
      generated by the photovoltaic device is lower than the power
      demand. The method further includes: instructing to trigger a
      desalination process and/or an adsorption cooling process, in
      order to dissipate heat from the collector thermal storage. The
      system further includes: a first heat circuit connecting the
      photovoltaic module to a photovoltaic thermal storage distinct
      from the collector thermal storage, to cool the photovoltaic
      module; and a second heat circuit, distinct from the first heat
      circuit, and connecting the collector thermal storage to the
      thermal collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The system further includes a heat exchanger, thermally
      connected to the photovoltaic thermal storage, and the method
      further includes instructing to provide heat stored in the
      photovoltaic thermal storage to a thermal user via the heat
      exchanger; in the system, the heat exchanger is further thermally
      connected to the collector thermal storage, the method further
      comprising instructing to provide additional heat stored in the
      collector thermal storage to the heat exchanger while providing
      heat stored in the photovoltaic thermal storage to the thermal
      user via the heat exchanger. The system further includes an
      additional heat exchanger thermally connected to the heat engine
      and a given thermal user, the given thermal user being further
      thermally connected to the photovoltaic thermal storage or to both
      the photovoltaic thermal storage and the collector thermal
      storage, via the heat exchanger, and the method further includes
      instructing the heat engine to start a process of
      thermal-to-electrical conversion of heat stored in the collector
      thermal storage using the given thermal user as a low temperature
      pool. In the system, a temperature in the collector thermal
      storage is substantially larger than a temperature in the
      photovoltaic thermal storage, preferably by more than 30[deg.] C.,
      more preferably by more than 50[deg.] C.; in the system, the
      photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar receiver is movably mounted in
      the system, such that the positioning mechanism can move the
      photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar receiver as a whole;<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In the system, the thermal collector extends in a first
      plane and includes an aperture; and the photovoltaic module
      includes a photo-active area within an area of the photovoltaic
      module that extends in a second plane, at a distance of the
      aperture, the photo-active area being vis-à-vis the aperture, a
      projection of the aperture perpendicularly to the second plane
      essentially corresponding to the photo-active area, and the
      thermal collector further preferably includes one of or both the
      following components: one or more minor elements provided in an
      intermediate section between the first plane and the second plane,
      the mirror elements preferably thermally connected to the
      collector thermal storage, by a same heat circuit that connects
      the thermal collector to the collector thermal storage; and a band
      pass filter arranged at the level of the aperture;<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The system further includes a concentrator, arranged to
      concentrate radiation towards an optical focus thereof, and the
      positioning mechanism is adapted to move the photovoltaic module
      in or out of the optical focus.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] According to another aspect, the invention is embodied as a
      photovoltaic thermal hybrid system, comprising: (i) an hybrid
      solar receiver, having a photovoltaic module designed for
      electrical output power delivery and a thermal collector distinct
      from the photovoltaic module, wherein the photovoltaic module
      and/or the thermal collector are movably mounted in the system;
      (ii) a collector thermal storage thermally connected to the
      thermal collector to store heat collected at the thermal
      collector; and (iii) positioning mechanism adapted to move the
      photovoltaic module and/or the thermal collector; and further
      comprising (iv) a control unit configured to instruct the
      positioning mechanism to move the photovoltaic module and/or the
      collector to change a ratio of an intensity of radiation received
      at the photovoltaic module to an intensity of radiation received
      at the thermal collector, e.g., based on a comparison of the
      output power with a power demand as received at the control unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Devices, systems, methods of operating such devices and
      systems, as well as computer program functions partly implementing
      embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way
      of non-limiting examples, and in reference to the accompanying
      drawings.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The present invention forms part of comprehensive CPVT
      solutions. Such solutions revolve around novel photovoltaic
      thermal hybrid receivers. Aspects of these solutions concern such
      receivers, cooling devices for such receivers, photovoltaic
      thermal hybrid systems and operation methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The present invention proposes novel systems and methods
      for operating a photovoltaic thermal hybrid system. Such systems
      and methods rely on a hybrid solar receiver, equipped with a
      photovoltaic (or PV) module capable of delivering an electrical
      output power, and a thermal collector distinct from the PV module.
      The PV module and/or the thermal collector are movably mounted in
      the system. Furthermore, a collector thermal storage is
      (thermally) connected to the thermal collector, in order to store
      heat collected at the latter. In addition, positioning mechanism
      are provided, which are adapted to move the PV module and/or the
      thermal collector. Then, instructing the positioning mechanism to
      move the PV module and/or the thermal collector results in
      changing the ratio of the intensity of radiation received at the
      PV module to the intensity received at the thermal collector.
      Thus, excess radiation received at the PV module (i.e., larger
      than necessary to meet a power demand) can advantageously be used
      to heat up the thermal circuit and store heat at the thermal
      storage.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The accompanying drawings are organized as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Cooling devices 25 such as depicted FIG. 1-4 can
      advantageously be used to cool PV receivers, as shown in FIGS. 4
      and 5. PV receivers 21 can advantageously be complemented by
      thermal collectors 22 such as depicted in FIGS. 6, 7. This results
      in hybrid receivers such as depicted in FIGS. 8, 9. The hybrid
      receivers can in turn be used in systems 10 such as depicted in
      FIGS. 10, 12-15.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The systems 10 can be complemented to enable short-term
      weather prediction, FIG. 19. The above systems 10 can be operated
      according to a method such as captured in the flowchart of FIG.
      11. A control system to implement such a method is depicted in
      FIG. 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In FIGS. 1-5, the following notations are used:<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Ll denotes the ithlevel out of L total levels;<br>
      <br>
      [0053] At level 1: Oih denotes the hthorifice of the inlet circuit
      (Ooh is its counterpart for the outlet circuit);<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Similarly, CPih represents the hthchannel portion of the
      inlet circuit, (CPoh pertains to the outlet circuit). For example,
      CPi1 denotes the first channel portion of the inlet circuit, at
      level 1;<br>
      <br>
      [0055] At level 2: Ohihk represents the kthorifice arising from
      CPih; CPohk denotes the corresponding channel portion;<br>
      <br>
      [0056] At level 3: Oihkl represents the lthorifice arising from
      CPihk, CPihkl denotes the corresponding channel portion, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The number of indices hkl . . . used to tag a particular
      orifice or channel portion corresponds to the level that the
      orifice or channel belongs to. For example, Oihk belongs to level
      2, while Oihkl belongs to level 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Referring to FIGS. 1-5 in general and more particularly to
      FIGS. 1 and 3, a chip module cooling device (or cooler) 25 as
      involved in embodiments includes two fluid circuits: an inlet
      fluid circuit i and an outlet fluid circuit o. Each circuit
      includes an arrangement of orifices Oi, Oo and channel portions
      CPi, CPo. The orifices are also referred to as nozzles in some
      places below: they can indeed be given various appropriate shapes
      such as injection nozzles. This arrangement can be regarded as
      forming (or reflecting) a tree structure. An example of such a
      tree structure is depicted in FIG. 3, wherein: branches represent
      the orifices Oi, Oo and nodes represent the channel portions CPi,
      CPo.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] As generally known in tree structures, a branch links a
      node to one child node only; nodes sharing a same parent node are
      called siblings, or sibling nodes. Thus, channel portions
      corresponding to sibling nodes may be called sibling channel
      portions.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Each fluid circuit extends through L levels (i.e., L1 to L3
      in FIG. 1) of the tree structure. The concept underlying the
      present cooling devices requires at least L&gt;3 levels. L can be
      larger, see e.g., FIG. 3. In FIG. 1, level L4 could be regarded as
      an additional level of the tree structure. However, L4 includes a
      modified orifice structure; it further includes channel portions
      of a heat exchanger, which shall be described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The circuits connect to each other at (or after) a final
      level (i.e., a lowest level of the tree structure), via channel
      portions corresponding to leaf nodes of the tree structure. The
      connection of the fluid circuits can be realized directly via the
      final "leaf" channel portions, or not. The connection may for
      instance involve additional orifices or any sort of connecting
      structure (channels, slits, etc.) "after" the leaf channel
      portions in the tree structure. Examples are given below. The
      additional mechanism need not be reflected in the above tree
      structure. Fluid communication from the inlet to the outlet fluid
      circuit is nonetheless enabled via a lowest level of the tree.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Now, for each of the two fluid circuits, the channel
      portions corresponding to sibling nodes have to fulfill two
      conditions:<br>
      <br>
      [0063] First, they are parallel to each other, i.e., the principal
      directions (or lines) of extension of sibling channel portions are
      parallel to each other. Parallel is here to be understood
      according to Euclid's definition of parallelism, i.e., it means
      strictly parallel and refers to two parallel distinct channel
      portions. In the example of FIG. 1, it can be seen that sibling
      channel portions are parallel; this for example is the case:<br>
      <br>
      [0064] At level 2 (L2): for channel portions CPi11, CPi12, and
      CPi13 for inlet circuit i. The same occurs for the corresponding
      outlet channel portions CPo11, CPo12, and CPo13; or<br>
      <br>
      [0065] At level 3 (L3) : for channel portions CPo131, CPo132,
      etc.;<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Note that at level 1 (L1), there is only one channel
      portion (CPi1 or CPo1) per circuit (i or o), forming only one
      channel.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Second, channel portions corresponding to sibling nodes
      extend along respective directions, none of which is parallel to
      the direction of extension of the channel portion corresponding to
      the parent node (compare e.g., L3-channel portions to L2-channel
      portions or L2-channel portions to L1-channel portions).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Provided that the directions do not intersect either (which
      shall improve compactness in fine), it follows that, each of the
      channel portions corresponding to sibling nodes extends along a
      direction which, together with a direction of extension of their
      parent node, form a pair of skew lines. This condition could be
      fulfilled at a given level, preferably more, of the tree structure
      and for each of the two fluid circuits. Siblings may span a plane
      parallel to the parent node of the sibling nodes. A sibling can
      thus be described as being "rotated", preferably by 90[deg.] (as
      is the case in FIG. 1 or 3), with respect to their parent channel
      portion. The extent of the rotation depends on the pattern drawn
      by the orifices, as to be explained in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Channel portions may advantageously fulfill the additional
      conditions below:<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Third, the channel portions corresponding to sibling nodes
      are preferably strictly parallel to channel portions corresponding
      to a grandparent node of the sibling nodes, if any. This is
      notably the case in FIG. 1 for all L3-channel portions (CPo131,
      CPo132, etc.) that are parallel to CPo1 or CPi1 of level 1. It can
      be realized that this third condition allows for improved
      compactness, simplifies the design and thus eases the manufacture
      of the device, all the more if L&gt;3. However, this is not a
      strict condition (especially if L=3). For example, L3-channel
      portions could extend not parallel to their L1-grand-parent
      channel portions, without critically impacting essential
      properties of the device. This could for instance be the case if
      other constraints (components, manufacture) oblige to shift
      grand-parent channel portions from their ideal direction of
      extension.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Fourth, channel portions corresponding to sibling nodes
      preferably span a plane parallel to channel portions corresponding
      to a parent node. Again, this may improve compactness and/or
      simplify the design and manufacture. This fourth condition is
      however not strict as the parent channel portions could extend in
      a same plane as the sibling channel portions (though rotated with
      respect to the latter). In particular, in FIG. 1, it can be seen
      that:<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Channel portions CP,i11, CPi12, and CPi13 are open on an
      upper plane of component 211, which upper plane is (strictly)
      parallel to the main direction of extension of channel portion
      CPi1 (the parent node of CPi11, CPi12, and CPi13).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] However, the main direction of extension of CPi1 is close
      to or can even be included in the average plane spanned by the
      main directions of extension of CPi11, CPi12, and CPi13. Because
      there are only one inlet channel and one outlet channel at level
      1, the latter can nonetheless be easily integrated in a same
      device block 251 as their child channel portions. Yet, because of
      the layer structure adopted in the example of FIG. 1, channel
      portions of level 3 do not belong to the same layer as the channel
      portions of level 2. Channel portions corresponding to sibling
      nodes of level 3 now span a plane strictly parallel to channel
      portions corresponding to a parent node. Thus, one understands
      that sibling channel portions may advantageously span a plane
      parallel to their parent, subject to other constraints.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Finally, channel portions of the inlet circuit (for example
      CPi11, CPi12, and CPi13) are parallel to and interdigitated with
      channel portions of the outlet circuit (for example CPo11, CPo12,
      and CPo13). Interdigitation means an interlinking, evoking fingers
      of two hands locked together, as illustrated in FIG. 1 or FIG. 3.
      Owing to the conditions that the device already fulfills,
      Interdigitation involves channel portions corresponding to a same
      level of the tree structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A similar arrangement is shown in FIG. 3. What FIG. 3
      actually depicts is a 3D tree structure, i.e., a tree abstraction,
      representing an arrangement of orifices and channel portions.
      However, it should be realized that a cooling device may be
      embodied with a geometry of channels as depicted in FIG. 3. In
      FIG. 3, for each of the inlet/outlet fluid circuits (i, o),
      channel portions corresponding to sibling nodes fulfill the same
      conditions as described earlier. Namely:<br>
      <br>
      [0076] First, siblings are parallel to each other, as for example
      is the case for: Channel portions CPi11 and siblings; the same
      occurs for their outlet counterparts (channel portions are not all
      referenced, for clarity); or Channel portions CPi111 and parallel
      siblings; and again, at level 1, there is only one channel portion
      CPi1 for the inlet circuit (and similarly for the outlet circuit).
      Second, they are not parallel to channel portions corresponding to
      a parent node of the sibling nodes (compare e.g., CPi111 to
      CPi11); they are instead rotated by 90[deg.]. Third, siblings are
      further parallel to channel portions corresponding to a
      grandparent node of the sibling nodes. This is notably the case
      for all channel portions of level 3 (CPi111 and siblings, inlet
      circuit) that are parallel to their unique grand-parent channel
      (CPi1, level 1, inlet circuit). Fourth, channel portions
      corresponding to sibling nodes (e.g., CPi11 and siblings, inlet
      circuit) span a plane, which, in the embodiment of FIG. 3, is
      strictly parallel to channel portions corresponding to a parent
      node (e.g., CPi1, inlet circuit).<br>
      <br>
      [0077] A structure such as described above allows for achieving a
      dense and homogeneous arrangement of channels at the heat exchange
      level, i.e., "after" the leaf level. In some cases at least, the
      third condition above further improves final compactness. The
      fourth condition may be omitted, depending on the number of
      grand-parents. Interdigitation results in a homogeneous
      distribution of channels and allows for minimizing fluid
      trajectory. The fractal-like pattern that results from channel
      subdivisions and rotations makes it possible, notably, to optimize
      heat exchange. In addition, particular implementations allow for
      minimizing the required pumping power for the coolant flow.
      Detailed examples are given below.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In addition, such a structure and its building principle
      are easily scalable, which is advantageous for e.g., multichip
      photovoltaic cells as the dimensions of the latter can
      substantially exceed typical integrated circuit (IC) chips.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Tests performed by the present inventors have shown that
      usual chip cooling devices (wherein fluid circuits can be seen as
      subdividing into a single level of multiple nozzles/channels) can
      be successfully used to cool down classical IC chips, without
      unreasonable pumping effort. Scalability is therefore not an issue
      for cooling classical IC chips. Now, classical IC chip cooling
      devices are not suitably dimensioned for multichip photovoltaic
      cells. Should one nonetheless want to use classical cooling
      devices for (larger) multichip photovoltaic devices, one may first
      be tempted to parallelize such classical cooling devices, owing to
      the dimensions of multichip photovoltaic devices compared to usual
      IC chips. However, experiments have shown that this is
      inappropriate, because some regions of the multichip photovoltaic
      devices shall not be satisfactorily cooled, due to the
      inhomogeneous cooling obtained by the parallel cooling devices.
      Next, should one want to scale a classical IC chip cooling device
      to typical multichip photovoltaic device's dimensions (wherein
      dimensions are likely multiplied by a factor &gt;5 compared to a
      typical IC chip), another issue arises. In that case, present
      inventors have realized that scaled cooling devices require a
      (too) large pumping effort.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] On the contrary, a cooling device comprising a multilevel
      and interdigitated arrangement of orifices/channel portions as
      described earlier is scalable, by construction. Such a building
      principle further allows for reaching a dense arrangement of
      channel portions at the leaf level, owing to the successive
      rotations of channel portions. Dimensions of cross-sections of
      both the channels and nozzles shall likely decrease from one level
      to the other, as the number of channel portions and nozzles
      increases from one level to the other. It can be realized that the
      height of the channels is not that critical: for instance, in
      embodiments, the height of the channels extends perpendicularly to
      the thickness of a layer wherein the channel is provided. However,
      the width of the channel portions (in the cross-section,
      perpendicular to the in-channel flow direction) shall typically
      decrease. In other words, if the density of the channels is
      maximal at level n, the channel sections shall likely be larger at
      level n-1 than at level n. A structure as described above allows
      for reducing the flow path to and within the heat transfer
      structure; it further allows for scalability while keeping a
      moderate pumping effort.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Typically, each of the two fluid circuits includes, at each
      level Ll (1&lt;=l&lt;=L-1):<br>
      <br>
      Nl orifices (or nozzles), each leading to a respective channel
      portion. An orifice typically branches in the middle of the
      respective channel portion, except at edges of the device. Other
      branching geometry can be contemplated, which however are expected
      to be less efficient; and<br>
      Nl parallel channel portions. In turn, each of the Nl channel
      portions shall enable fluid distribution to Bl+1 orifices of the
      next level Ll+1, where Bl+1 is a branching factor, defined by
      Bl+1=Nl+1/Nl. Successive subdivisions of the channel circuits
      require B2&gt;=2 and B3&gt;2; B1 can be assumed to be equal to 1.
      For example, in FIG. 3:<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Oi1 leads to CPi1 (level 1, B1=1);<br>
      <br>
      [0085] CPi1 subdivides via Oi11, Oi12 and Oi13 into respective
      channel portions (CPi11 and siblings, level 2, B2=3);<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Each of the L2-channel portions (CPi11 and siblings) leads
      to four channel portions. For example, CPi11 leads to CPi111 (via
      Oi111), as well as to three other parallel channel portions
      (siblings) via respective orifices; CP112 leads to CPi121 as well
      as to three other parallel channel portions (siblings), etc. Thus,
      at level 2: each channel portion of the inlet circuit enables
      fluid distribution to B3=4 inlet orifices (e.g., Oi11k, k=1, 2, 3,
      4) of the next level L3. The same holds for channel portions of
      the outlet fluid circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In other words, the tree structure underlying each fluid
      circuit is typically balanced, as i1lustrated in FIG. 3, i.e., the
      branching factor Bm+1 is preferably the same for each channel
      portion at a given level Lm, whereby both the design and the
      manufacture of the device are made easier.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Next, the arrangement of orifices/channel portions can be
      designed such that each circuit has exactly the same geometry,
      which simplifies the manufacture and assembly of the device.
      Meanwhile, the arrangement can be designed to optimize the fluid
      distribution at a leaf level, i.e., in the vicinity of the heat
      exchanger. One possibility is to have, at a given level Lm
      (2&lt;=m&lt;=L), the positions of orifices of one fluid circuit
      correspond to a first set of discrete points of a first finite
      array. In analogy with 2D crystallography, this first array may be
      regarded as generated by a set of discrete translations R, i.e.,
      defined by R=n1a1+n2 a2, where n1 and n2 are integers and a1 and
      a2 are linearly independent vectors (as defined in linear
      algebra). Channel portions at level Lm-1 extend along or parallel
      to a1 and channel portions at levels Lm extend along or parallel
      to a2. Finally, the positions of orifices of the other fluid
      circuit may correspond to second set of discrete points of a
      second finite array, translated from the first array by a
      translation r defined by r=x1a1+x2a2, with 0&lt;x1&lt;1 and
      0x2&lt;1. Preferably, on chooses x1=x2=1/2, which optimizes the
      homogeneity of the fluid distribution at the level of the heat
      exchange. Choosing x1or x2&lt;&gt;1/2 would instead induce
      heterogeneity in the set of trajectories throughout the fluid
      structure and therewith would cause heterogeneous fluid
      distribution within the heat exchanger, resulting in heterogeneous
      cooling. Note that for m&lt;=L-1, we have 0&lt;x1&lt;1 and
      0&lt;x2&lt;1, while for m=L, we have 0&lt;=x1&lt;1 and
      0&lt;x2&lt;1 or 0&lt;=x1&lt;1 and 0&lt;=x2&lt;1. Also, as a
      consequence of the above arrangement, the N1 channel portions at
      level L1 are rotated with respect to channel portions of the
      next/previous level, typically by an angle [alpha]=[pi]/2 for a
      square lattice, as illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Should the basis unit of the lattice differ (e.g., oblique
      lattice), then channel portions corresponding to child nodes of a
      given parent node would be rotated by an angle [alpha] with
      respect to the parent channel portion and grand-child channel
      portions would preferably be rotated by an angle [pi]-[alpha], to
      be in phase with the parent.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] For example, in FIG. 3, at level L3, the positions of {,
      Oi111, Oi121, Oi112, . . . } map onto a first array, generated by
      translations R=n1a1+n2a2. Channel portions at level L2 (e.g.,
      CPi11 and siblings) extend along or parallel to a1 and channel
      portions at levels L3 extend along or parallel to a2. Finally, the
      positions of orifices of the other fluid circuit (not referenced
      for clarity) correspond to a second set of discrete points of a
      second array, at any level. L1 to L3 outlet orifices are
      translated from the first array by r=(a1+a2)/2. Next, in order to
      take account of edge effects, L3-channel portions are modified:
      the leftmost inlet channel portions are reduced (compare CPi111 to
      CPi121) and the corresponding orifices branch at one end thereof;
      the outlet structure is simply rotated with respect to the inlet
      circuit ([pi]-rotation around Oi1) and is still shifted. As a
      result, L4 outlet orifices are translated from the first array by
      r=a1/2 only, consistently with the fact that for m=L, the
      condition for x1 and x2 becomes 0&lt;=x1&lt;1 and 0&lt;x2&lt;1 or
      0&lt;x1&lt;1 and 0&lt;=x2&lt;1, as noted above. Such an
      arrangement has several advantages: (i) it makes it possible for
      the inlet and outlet circuits to have exactly the same structure
      (outlet circuit is simply rotated with respect to inlet circuit);
      (ii) it furthermore equalizes the fluid trajectories from one
      circuit to the other at level 4 (the fluid path length between one
      inlet orifice to the closest outlet orifice is ¦a1¦/2; and (iii)
      the two circuits have the same footprint (square lattice).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Next, depending on the orifice arrangement, subsets of
      channel portions may rejoin to draw channel lines, at a given
      level (e.g., CPi111, CPi121 and CPi131 form one such subset at
      level 3 in FIG. 3), or at several levels. Typically, two adjoining
      channel portions in any such subset are cousins (e.g., CPi111 and
      CPi121). Accordingly, it can be concluded that, in this example,
      any two channel portions at any level are either strictly parallel
      (like CPi111 and CPi112 siblings) or extend along a same line
      (like CPi111 and CPi121 cousins). In that respect, since a line
      can be defined by a point and a direction vector and two lines can
      be defined as parallel if their direction vectors are, two
      identical lines are parallel according to this definition, even if
      they are not according to Euclid's definition (where two parallel
      distinct lines are called strictly parallel). Thus, any two
      channel portions at any level are at least non-strictly parallel.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Note that a design option such as discussed in the previous
      paragraph might be implied by the positions of the orifices, in
      particular if the latter map onto an array as discussed above. In
      all cases, this design option substantially simplifies the
      geometry and manufacture of the cooling device, as subsets of
      channel portions extend along a same direction. A given channel
      line shall include channel portions arranged in-line, wherein
      fluid communication is possibly enabled from one channel portion
      to another. Whether to do so shall actually depend on various
      parameters, flow rates, channel sections, etc. For example, each
      of the fluid circuits i, o may include (at least in one level L1
      thereof): N1 channel portions forming Nci strictly parallel
      channel lines Ci, Co, wherein each of the Nci channel lines
      includes channel portions arranged in-line. In fact, at a given
      level, sibling channel portions are strictly parallel (e.g., FIG.
      3, CPi111 and CPi112, level 3), but some of the channel portions
      that have different parents (e.g., CPi111, CPi121 and CPi131) may
      be arranged in-line, resulting in Nci parallel channels (Nc3=4 at
      level 3 in the example of FIG. 3). The channel portions arranged
      in-line are not necessarily in fluid connection: one may for
      example have walls between the channel portions arranged in-line
      or the channel portions. Note that one necessarily has
      Bl&lt;=Ncl&lt;=Nl, from the above definitions.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] A particularly simple design is obtained by setting Ncl=B1,
      whereby Ncl parallel channel lines correspond to Ncl parallel
      lines of orifices, as i1lustrated in FIG. 3, level 3. Accordingly,
      each of the fluid circuits may include Nl channel portions forming
      Bl strictly parallel channel lines. In that case, each channel
      line includes Bl-1 channel portions arranged in-line (and this,
      possibly at each level Ll). Again, channel portions in a given
      channel line may be connected to enable fluid communication from
      one channel portion to another. Now, one channel line may include
      a unique channel portion. For example, at level 1, one has
      Ci1=CPi1, assuming Bo=1 in that case; at level 2, one has
      Ci11=CPi11, etc., since B1=1. However, at level 3, there are
      Nc3=B3=4 parallel channel lines (for each fluid circuit), which
      lines correspond to respective parallel lines of orifices and
      include, each, 3 orifices and 3 respective channel portions
      (B2=3).<br>
      <br>
      [0094] In addition, it is desirable to further improve the
      compactness of the arrangement, to minimize the fluid
      trajectories. To that aim, Ncl strictly parallel channel lines Ci
      of the inlet fluid circuit may advantageously be interdigitated
      with No strictly parallel channel lines Co of the outlet fluid
      circuit, at a given level Lm (1&lt;=m&lt;=L). Accordingly, each
      channel line of the inlet fluid circuit results to be parallel to
      each channel line of the outlet fluid circuit at that level Lm.
      Interdigitation of channel lines can actually be provided at
      several levels, and more preferably at each level where channel
      portions can form channel lines), to increase compactness. In that
      respect, it should be borne in mind that FIGS. 1 and 3 depict
      simple examples, but additional levels (and layers) of channel
      portions may actually be contemplated.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Next, a specific pattern of channel portions shall be
      discussed in reference to FIG. 1 (enlarged "B" area) and FIG. 2
      (focusing on the specific pattern shown in the enlarged "B" area,
      designed for sublayer sL32 of the device of FIG. 1). Namely, at a
      given level Lm and for each of the fluid circuits, at least some
      of the Nm channel portions may be designed to have a non-constant
      cross-section. As seen in FIG. 2, inlet and outlet channel
      portions can be suitably shifted (i.e., interdigitated) to
      maintain a compact arrangement (compare e.g., CPi124 to CPo124).
      More specifically, the channel portions may, each, include an
      enlarged area vis-à-vis a respective one of the Nm orifices, to
      improve fluid distribution from/to orifices of the respective
      channel portions (at a given level Lm).<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Additional design options can be contemplated, which take
      account of edge effects. For example, at a given level Lm (e.g.,
      L3 in FIG. 1) two sets of orifices (e.g., Oi11k and Oo13k, k=1, 2,
      . . . ), each comprising Bm orifices, are arranged in
      correspondence with respective outermost channels (e.g., CPi11 and
      CPo13) of a previous level Lm-1. Then, each of the Bm orifices of
      the two sets and/or each of their respective channel portions may
      have reduced dimensions along a particular direction of extension
      of the channels at level Lm (i.e., direction x in FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The cooling device may further include a heat transfer
      structure 24, in addition to a manifold system, to supply and
      drain liquid to and from the heat transfer structure, as
      i1lustrated in FIG. 1 and FIG. 4. In variants, the heat transfer
      structure 24 could be first integrated to a photovoltaic module,
      and later be connected to the cooling device. In all cases, the
      heat transfer structure 24 can be configured to connect one of the
      fluid circuits to the other. The heat transfer structure
      preferably includes silicon, and is more preferably entirely made
      of silicon, for reasons that will be discussed later.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The heat transfer structure may for instance include heat
      transfer channel portions (e.g., CPt1311, CPt1312 in FIG. 1,
      enlarged area "D"). Each of the transfer channel portions connects
      at least one channel portion (e.g., CPi131 in FIG. 1)
      corresponding to a leaf node of the inlet fluid circuit to one
      channel portion (e.g., CPo131 in FIG. 1) corresponding to a leaf
      node of the outlet fluid circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Preferably, each heat transfer channel portion extends
      along a direction rotated with respect to a direction of extension
      of the channel portions that it connects, following the same
      principle as already discussed in respect of the tree-structured
      channel portions of the cooling device.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Similarly, heat transfer channel portions may connect the
      lowest-level channel portions via slits (e.g., Si131 and So131 in
      FIG. 1), following the same principle as for orifices nozzles
      discussed thus far, except that the dimensions typically involved
      at the level of the heat transfer structure make it preferable to
      have a slit instead of a dense in-line arrangement of orifices,
      for manufacturability reasons. Yet, a slit can be seen as the
      asymptotic limit of such an arrangement. In that sense, the heat
      transfer structure can be regarded as forming or completing an
      additional level of the tree structure underlying each fluid
      circuit, e.g., level 4 in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] Next, the cumulated width of all orifices (in
      cross-sectional areas) of one of the levels is preferably kept
      substantially equal (e.g., to +-15%) to the cumulated width in
      cross-sectional area of all orifices of another, e.g., a
      contiguous level (and preferably of all of the other levels), in
      order to limit the pumping effort.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In an example, at a given level Lm:<br>
      <br>
      [0103] the length of a channel portion (not at an edge) is
      Lm=(L1-Wmin)/Bm-1; and<br>
      <br>
      [0104] the width of a channel portion is Wm=Lm-1/Bm/2-Wmin,<br>
      <br>
      [0105] wherein Wm is a width of the channel portions at level m
      and Wmin is a minimal wall thickness. The above dimensions are
      valid if Wm is the same for inlet and outlet channel portions and
      if it is constant for each portion, subject to edge effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The height of the channels may for instance be independent
      from one level to each other. Assuming that all levels should have
      the same footprint, the relationship between the lateral
      dimensions of the channels from one level to the next shall
      notably depend on the branching factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] In terms of manufacturability, it may be advantageous to
      have one or more levels embodied, each, as superimposed sub-layers
      (e.g., sL31 and sL32 for level 3 in FIG. 1). In FIG. 1: a first
      sub-layer sL31 includes orifices, whereas the second sub-layer
      sL32 includes channel portions. Both the orifices and channel
      portions can be machined as through holes in their respective
      sub-layers, which makes the manufacture process easier.
      Superimposed layers may be made of different materials, if
      necessary, since the different dimensions and shapes of the
      channel portions vs. orifices may more easily be processed using
      different materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] A cooling device such as described above is advantageously
      used together with a photovoltaic receiver 20, such as depicted in
      FIG. 8 or 9. This receiver may include a photovoltaic module 21,
      such as depicted in FIG. 4 or 5. The receiver shall further
      include a heat circuit portion 71a (FIG. 8, 9), connected to the
      photovoltaic module and the cooling device 25, the latter forming
      part of the heat circuit portion 71a.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Preferably, the above cooling device is used together with
      a photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar receiver 20, such as
      i1lustrated in FIG. 8 or 9. The latter further includes thermal
      collector 22, distinct from the photovoltaic module 21 of the
      receiver. In that case, the heat circuit portion 71a is a first
      heat circuit portion 71a, distinct from a second heat circuit
      portion 72a, that connects to the thermal collector. Such a
      photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar receiver 20 shall be described
      in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0110] Cooling Devices: Specific Implementation Details</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0111] The cooling device is preferably designed to allow for
      cooling the cell package with elevated temperatures of the coolant
      while keeping the cell at a moderate temperature (&lt;100[deg.]
      C.). This way the collected thermal energy is of high value due to
      its elevated temperature level.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] For this purpose the cooling device is preferably designed
      to have minimal thermal resistance between the PV cells and the
      cooling fluid. A cooling device such as described above may
      provide thermal resistance of less 0.11 cm&lt;2&gt;K/W. Assuming
      the PV cell is connected to the cooling device by a solder
      interface the total thermal resistance from the PV cell surface to
      the liquid coolant is around 0.17 cm&lt;2&gt;K/W. This allows
      cooling for heat flux densities of more than 400 W/cm&lt;2
      &gt;while keeping the cell at less than 100[deg.] C. (assuming the
      fluid inlet temperature is 30[deg.] C.).<br>
      <br>
      [0113] The cooler can be optimized to operate at low pumping
      powers, thereby reducing the energy needed to operate the system.
      The above solutions allow a homogenous cooling performance over an
      extended area ([Delta]T&lt;+-0.2 K) that can be easily scaled.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Reliability of the package may also be considered. A
      solution using silicon as substrate material allows a good thermal
      coefficient of expansion match between the PV cells (typically
      germanium) and the cooler, which reduces stress on the cells. Use
      of silicon further allows for using MEMS processes to structure
      cooler surface and implement sensing elements in the cooler
      (temperature, radiation, pressure . . . ).<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Minimizing pumping power while maximizing temperature
      homogeneity across the cooler surface can be both achieved with an
      efficient manifold such as described above, i.e., a hierarchical
      fluid distribution/collection system with two main paths (fluid
      inlet and outlet).<br>
      <br>
      [0116] A layer-wise implementation of distribution channels
      (manifold) and injection orifices (nozzles) allows for: using
      different materials and fabrication methods to cover the broad
      range of structure dimensions (e.g., from 20 [mu]m to 20 mm or
      more); using different materials, which in turn allows for
      achieving low thermo-mechanical stress in the cooling layer,
      increasing the lifetime of the package, and scalability.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The cooler package is preferably fabricated using MEMS
      technology, taking advantage of definition and processing of
      microstructures, batch processing, bonding techniques, integration
      of sensing elements, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] In reference to FIG. 1, 4 or 5, this package typically
      includes a layer 21, on top, comprising PV cells 211, forming a
      multichip module 212, the PV cells connected by electrical
      interconnects (see below); bypass electrodes 213; and an
      electrical layer (214), to connect the bottom electrodes of the PV
      cells. Layer 21 may further contain: a sensor layer with a network
      of resistive temperature devices to map the temperature over the
      entire package right at the bottom of the PV cell (not shown); an
      insulation layer, to insulate the sensor layer to electrical layer
      (not shown). These layers are typically processed using thin film
      deposition techniques as well as galvanic processes. Solders can
      be applied by a galvanic process too or any conventional process
      like screen printing.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] In the cooling sub-layers, micro channels can be fabricated
      by DRIE to enhance heat removal. These channels can be also
      fabricated using multiple dicing saws. In an orifice sub-layer
      (e.g., sL31 in FIG. 1): orifices can be fabricated by DRIE. Die
      casting and other mass production processes can also be used to
      fabricate such a sub-layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] A multichip module package including a cooling device as
      described above may include high efficiency triple junction solar
      cells (or "3JPV", commercially available) soldered onto a
      substrate with a minimal distance between each other; a cooler
      package (or heat sink) having a micro machined silicon wafer 24,
      i.e., a heat exchanger and carrier of electrical network, with a
      micro machined heat transfer structure on the bottom side,
      comprising channels (such as CPt1311 in FIG. 1 or 4); integrated
      temperature sensors; an electrical network consisting of
      electrically conductive pads (214) which connect to the bottom
      electrode of a PV cell; a manifold system, for fluid distribution
      and collection, with one substrate combining orifice sub-layer
      sL41 and manifold sub-layer sL32 and one substrate with orifice
      sub-layer sL31. With such a (specific) design, two sub-layers can
      be combined in a single substrate to take advantage of the
      specific process of double side DRIE. Doing so the number of
      components and interfaces can be reduced. In general layers should
      be combined if the process and the design allow, in order to
      reduce fabrication costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Electrical interconnects (including conductive pad 214,
      connection 216, etc.) which connect a top electrode of one cell to
      a top electrode of another cell in case of a parallel connection
      or which connect a top electrode of one cell to a electrically
      conductive pad 214 which is again connected to the bottom
      electrode of another cell in case of a serial connection (see
      below, 300 [mu]m wire bond, soldered or welded Cu ribbon or lead
      frame). A carrier 251 for mechanical support and interface to
      larger system includes a manifold layer (embodying both levels L1
      and L2), made of polymer, metal, composite materials, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] In reference to FIG. 5, a multichip module receiver package
      shall typically include, in addition to components described
      earlier, a shield 215 to protect components not meant to be
      exposed to radiation. In addition, the shield encapsulates the PV
      cell package to protect against dust, humidity, etc. The shield
      further includes a cover window 215a that can be used to filter
      radiation, if needed, see section 2.2. Shield walls 215b can be
      used as secondary reflectors to homogenize incoming radiation. The
      shield has a heat recovery system that can be coupled to the
      cooling loop, in series, or to a separate heat circuit, as
      described in detail below<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0123] Photovoltaic Thermal Hybrid Solar Receivers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0124] In reference to FIGS. 6-10, novel photovoltaic thermal
      hybrid solar receivers 20 are now described. In each case, the
      hybrid receivers first include a thermal collector 22. The latter
      extends in a first plane 220, which plane typically is a main
      plane of extension of the thermal collector, i.e., the plane onto
      which radiation can be received and collected. The location of the
      first plane is preferably taken at the level of the average plane
      of the thermal collection panel of the collector, as depicted in
      FIG. 8 or 9. This thermal plane can therefore also be referred to
      as a 'shield', as done in some places below. In addition, the
      thermal collector includes an aperture 68.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The receivers 20 further include a photovoltaic module 21.
      Such a module is designed for delivering an electrical output
      power Po, in operation, as known per se. The module notably
      includes a photo-active area 212 that extends in a second plane
      210. The latter typically is a main plane of extension of the area
      212, e.g., the average plane of the photo-active pane of the
      module. It is furthermore preferably parallel to the first plane,
      for both simplicity and efficiency reasons, though parallelism is
      not a requirement at all. In all cases the second plane 210 is
      located at a distance 232 (see FIG. 8 or 9) of the first plane 220
      and the area 212 is located vis-à-vis the aperture 68. The
      projection of the aperture, i.e., perpendicularly to the second
      plane 210, corresponds to the photo-active area (or essentially
      corresponds to it). Here, 'essentially' means that the
      photo-active area may represent 80 to 100% of the projected area
      of the aperture.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] The above design, wherein plane 210 is distant from the
      plane 220 and area 212 is set vis-à-vis aperture 68, allows for
      easily varying a ratio of radiation exposure of the photovoltaic
      module 21 to the thermal collector 22, e.g., by simply translating
      the device perpendicularly to plane 210, with respect to a
      radiation focus point or plane. This device accordingly makes it
      possible to rapidly "switch" from PV power delivery to thermal
      power storage.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] Another advantage is that: when the light beam is
      defocused, the PV electrical output becomes smaller but the
      thermal output on the front target is larger. A benefit can
      therefore follows even with a misalignment. Thus, a less accurate
      tracker and a higher maximal optical concentration with a lower
      cost mirror can be reached.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In addition, the thermal collector and the photovoltaic
      module may be configured to protect peripheral regions of the
      photovoltaic module from radiation hitting the thermal collector.
      Namely, the thermal collector may be designed to protect
      peripheral regions of the main plane of the photovoltaic module
      and at least partly shields radiation received from a light source
      at the photovoltaic module, e.g., to protect passive diodes or
      passive components in the photovoltaic module.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Preferably, a hybrid receiver further includes a first heat
      circuit portion (ref. 71a in FIG. 8 or 9), thermally connected to
      the photovoltaic module (at the back thereof), and a second heat
      circuit portion (72a) thermally connected to the thermal
      collector. The circuit portions can be connected to respective
      heat circuit portions, typically closed-loop, as to be discussed
      below. The circuit portions 71a and 72b can be thermally insulated
      from each other, if necessary. Portion 71a or 72a, or both
      portions 71a and 72a could for instance be embodied as a cooling
      device such as described earlier, in section 2.1, see e.g., ref.
      25 in FIG. 1 or 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Typically, the first circuit portion 71a is inserted in a
      first heat circuit 71, configured to cool the PV receiver, and the
      second circuit portion 72a is inserted in a second circuit 72,
      independent from the first circuit, and connecting in turn to a
      thermal storage, to serve a purpose described in the next section.
      In variants, the first portion 71a and the second portion 72a may
      be thermally connected, in series, in a same heat circuit, subject
      to additional constraints to be discussed later. For completeness,
      FIGS. 8, 9 show inlet/outlet circuit sections 71i, 71o, 72i, 72o,
      of respective circuits 71, 72.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] The distance 232, as well as the distance 231 between the
      area 212 and a lower end 68a of aperture 68 both depend on a
      number of design and system options, which are discussed later in
      details (desired insulation, circuitry dimensions, presence of a
      homogenizer, a filter, a concentrator and characteristics thereof,
      translational speed and desired reactivity of the system, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0132] For instance, the end 68a of the aperture 68 that is the
      closest to the photo-active area 212 is preferably kept at a
      (small) distance from this area 212, as i1lustrated in FIG. 8, to
      ensure thermal insulation. Typically, this end of the aperture 68
      is located at a distance larger than or equal to 0.2 mm, which may
      already suffice to insulate the thermal collector from the PV
      receiver, as tests have demonstrated (air can be used as
      insulating medium). However, depending on the PV module size and
      cooling circuit temperature used, this distance may need to be
      larger than or equal to 0.5 mm, and/or other insulating material
      may be used. On the other hand, this distance is preferably
      smaller than or equal to 3.0 mm. Indeed, it can be realized that
      this gap needs to be small enough so that light cannot "escape".
      Namely, light exiting the aperture has a defined angle, the above
      distance is therefore designed small enough so that outcoming rays
      shall not hit the periphery of the active area. Depending on other
      device specifications, this distance may more preferably be
      smaller than or equal to 2.0 mm, and even more preferably 1.0 mm.
      The accompanying figures are obviously not to scale, at least not
      in respect of every feature shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] Now, it can be realized that, since (i) minimal thermal
      circuit sections typically have a diameter of 5 mm, and (ii) the
      end 68a is located at a distance larger than 0.2 mm, then the
      minimal distance 232 need be larger than 2.7 mm. Instead, using a
      6 mm circuit diameter would bring this value to 3.2 mm. This
      minimal distance is increased if, in addition, an intermediate
      homogenizer is used (e.g., at least 10 mm, optimally 60 mm long
      for an aperture of approximately 35*35 mm and an light incidence
      angle of 53[deg.], the rim angle of the parabolic dish). More
      generally, if no homogenizer is provided, the minimal distance
      232, FIG. 8, is determined by the dimensions of the thermal
      collector (that includes thermal circuit 72a, panels, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Note that, at variance to FIG. 8 or 9, the thermal
      collector 22 may include a tapered aperture section, i.e., with a
      non-constant cross section. In that case, the end 68a of the
      aperture 68 would correspond to a smallest cross sectional area of
      the non-constant cross section.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] As evoked earlier, the thermal collector may further
      include one or more minor elements 74 (see FIG. 6, 7 or 9), for
      example a light homogenizer or, more generally, optics, i.e.,
      secondary optics (beyond a concentrator), in an intermediate
      section 75 between the first plane 220 and the second plane 210.
      Such mirror elements can be configured to specifically reflect
      incoming light 90a-c and distribute reflected light 90b-c onto the
      photo-active area 212, as i1lustrated in FIG. 9. For example,
      minor elements may be configured to homogenize and/or further
      concentrate reflected radiation 90b-c onto area 212. To that aim,
      simple possibilities consist of having at least three or four
      mirror elements 74, forming a closed hollow section 75, as
      depicted in FIG. 6, 7, or 9. Yet, a single tubular minor could be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Advantageously, the one or more minor elements 74 are
      thermally connected to the second heat circuit portion 72a, such
      as to benefit to a corresponding heat circuit. In that case,
      optimal results shall be obtained if a part, at least, of the
      circuit portion 72a is coiled around the minor elements, as shown
      in FIG. 9 or 10. The needed circuitry can for instance be suitably
      molded or arranged in an insulating body, as better seen in FIG.
      7, wherein sections 72a1-7 of the second heat circuit portion are
      visible.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] Interestingly, the thermal collector may further include a
      bandpass filter 76 (see FIG. 7 or 9), e.g., at the level of an
      upper end of the aperture 68 and fit within the aperture, to
      specifically select a bandwidth where conversion efficiency of the
      PV cells is optimal. A passband which is optimal for purposes
      described later is 350-1500 nm, i.e., it corresponds to the
      spectrum where preferred PV cells have a conversion efficiency
      larger than 80%. Preferred PV cells are typically multi junction
      solar cells, e.g., from Boing Spectrolab, Emcore, Azur Space
      amongst others.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Advantageously, the filter can further be designed to
      thermally absorb radiation wavelengths outside the passband, i.e.,
      to benefit again to a heat circuit, preferably the second heat
      circuit 72, in form of higher grade thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] In that respect, the filter may include a hollow cavity
      filled with a cooling fluid 77 (see FIG. 7), in fluid
      communication with a heat circuit, e.g., circuit 72. Other options
      are discussed later.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] Next, hybrid receivers 20 such as described above can
      advantageous be used in an apparatus 10 such as depicted in FIG.
      10 (or more schematically in FIG. 12 or 13). Such an apparatus
      shall further include a concentrator 27. The latter is designed
      and configurable to concentrate radiation towards an optical focus
      80, as known per se. The optical focus 80 is a region of maximal
      intensity of concentrated light, e.g., essentially located to
      small volume or confined close to a plane, e.g., plane 80,
      depending on actual implementations.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The apparatus (or the concentrator device itself) further
      includes positioning mechanism 27a, 27b, 30, which can have
      various purposes. In that respect, the receiver and/or the
      concentrator can be movably mounted in the apparatus via the
      positioning mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] For example, the positioning mechanism may be configured to
      change a ratio of intensity of radiation 90b,c received at the
      photovoltaic module to intensity of radiation 90a received at the
      thermal collector. Because of their relative dimensions, it shall
      likely be simpler to make the hybrid receiver movably mounted in
      the apparatus 10 via positioning mechanism 30 rather than the
      concentrator. The receiver can further be movable with respect to
      the optical focus 80. Accordingly, the receiver and/or the
      concentrator are movable (e.g., along bi-directional axis 84) by
      the positioning mechanism from a position where the photovoltaic
      module 21 is in the optical focus 80 to a position where the
      thermal collector 22 is in the optical focus.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] Changing the ratio of intensity evoked just above is
      accordingly very easily obtained, e.g., via a simple translation
      of the receiver and/or the concentrator. In this regard, the
      positioning mechanism may simply be embodied as one of: a linear
      actuator, such as a rack and pinion; or a vehicle, such as a
      wheeled vehicle, a tracked vehicle, or a railed vehicle, for
      example comprising a trolley, a bogie, etc. more generally, the
      positioning mechanism 30 preferably enables bidirectional motion
      along an axis 84 perpendicular to second plane 210. The mechanism
      30 is preferably specifically dedicated to the task of changing
      the above ratio, and possibly to that task only. Usual tracking
      systems do not enable suitable bidirectional motion along axis 84,
      in operation. Indeed, in prior systems, the receiver's position is
      refined during setup but it is then fixed (definitively) for the
      life of the system for standard systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Now, the concentrator 27 or one or more elements 271
      thereof may further be movably mounted in the apparatus via other
      positioning mechanism 27a, 27b, as schematically depicted in FIGS.
      10, 12, and 13.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] FIGS. 12-13, which are simplified representations of two
      hybrid systems, illustrate the variation of the spot geometry at
      the receiver. In each case, the upper drawing represents a
      configuration for which the spot is focused at the receiver plane,
      while the spot is defocused in the lower drawing. In addition, in
      FIG. 12, a classical parabolic concentrator (minor) 27 is used,
      while in FIG. 13, the concentrator includes a plurality of mirrors
      271, which can be actuated by respective positioning mechanism
      27b, to change the spot geometry at a receiver plane (210 or 220,
      in FIG. 8-9).<br>
      <br>
      [0146] As schematically i1lustrated, the spot geometry at a
      receiver plane can be changed by:<br>
      <br>
      [0147] FIG. 12: displacement of the receiver along the optical
      axis 84, e.g., in a rotational symmetric parabolic concentrator,
      should a homogenizer be involved or not; and/or<br>
      <br>
      [0148] FIG. 13: changing the shape of the primary concentrator,
      for example by tilting of one or more (flat) elements 271 of a
      faceted minor.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] In addition, one may defocus the spot by changing the
      curvature of the main mirror or the one of secondary optics in a
      folded beam arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] As touched above, to move the receiver module 20 out of
      focus, the receiver can be mounted on a movable stage. The stage
      can be actuated by a shaft and a stepper motor that are themselves
      mounted in a fix position in reference to the focal plane of the
      concentrator system. This adjustable receiver positioning unit
      represents a control element 30, symbolically represented by
      reference 30 in FIG. 10. Alternatively the stage with the receiver
      can be moved using a hydraulic or pneumatic actuated piston, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] FIG. 16 shows typical cross sections of the intensity
      distribution (normalized intensity) at the PV receiver module
      plane (ref. 220 in FIG. 8-9), when using a rotational symmetric
      parabolic primary concentrator, for a receiver module displaced
      along the optical axis of the system. The x-axis represents a
      distance r (mm) along a section passing through the aperture,
      where r=0 corresponds to a center of the aperture (typically a
      symmetry center). The darker gray box corresponds to the aperture,
      while the lighter gray boxes denotes the shield, i.e., the thermal
      panel of the collector 22 extending parallel 220 to the receiver
      PV module plane 220. As indicated by the various curves
      represented in FIG. 16, a light beam can be focused such that the
      radiation intensity distributes mostly or essentially within a
      zone corresponding to the aperture (this intensity shall
      accordingly be converted to electrical power thanks to the PV
      cells).<br>
      <br>
      [0152] Defocusing the spot (or altering the mirror shape/elements)
      results in widening the intensity profile, such that radiation
      becomes essentially collected at the shield.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] In that respect, the shield 22a (FIGS. 6-9) is preferably
      made substantially larger than the aperture 68. Typically, the
      aperture's dimensions (e.g., between 10*10 and 30*30 mm) reflect
      that of the PV-MCM, while the overall shield dimension can reach
      200*200 mm or more (e.g., 500*500 mm is possible).<br>
      <br>
      [0154] FIG. 17 shows the total irradiance (normalized power)
      captured by the thermal collector (dotted curve) and the PV
      receiver (full line) while displacing the element along the
      optical axis (distance d (mm) in abscissa) towards the primary
      concentrator. Typically, ~30% of the solar radiation reaching the
      PVT receiver can be converted to electrical energy while the
      remaining 70% can be captured as heat, which together with the
      irradiance captured by the thermal collector contributes to a
      storage system. The design point of the system is preferably set
      to be between 90-20% of the load on the PVT receiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] A number of conceptual variants can be contemplated. For
      instance, the thermal collector may have a conical shape. The
      thermal collector and the homogenizer could be one and a same
      element, provided with a suited shape to both collect solar
      radiation and distribute/concentrate reflected light as
      appropriate onto the PV receiver. When using a flat facetted
      mirror concentrator (as in FIG. 13), some of the facets could be
      fixed, others could be moved. Facets of the primary mirror can be
      tilted to redirect light on the periphery of the receiver 20,
      where the thermal receiver panel is placed.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] Additional variants may include light cones mounted
      directly on the PV chips with cooling (high temperature) that
      eliminate inactive surfaces on 3JPV chip array. Such cones are
      arranged such as to redirect that light that would otherwise hit
      contact pads of the solar cells and the gap between them. Light is
      redirected to the photoactive area, thereby increasing the
      electrical efficiency of the system. A front electrode grid with
      reflective surfaces may prevent shading of sensitive PV surface.
      Antireflection surfaces using, e.g., moth eye patterns may be
      combined with front electrode grating that contributes to the
      wavelength filtering function by reflecting UV/blue light back to
      the homogenizer, to serve the more general functions of adsorption
      enhancement and filtering, as described earlier. Switchable
      absorbers, depending on humidity (large humidity and early
      morning/late evening may increase red shift and underload blue
      diode. Additional red absorbers may also be included.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] The various features recited above, in respect of hybrid
      receivers, can be advantageously combined, in several manners. For
      example, exergetic recovery can be optimized by having a separate
      cooling loop 71 for the multichip receiver cooling 25 and for the
      homogenizer and shield cooling 72. As explained, electrical output
      can be controlled by moving the assembly along the optical axis
      closer to the minor and away from the focal plane. Exergy
      optimization can further use a wavelength selective reflective
      filter to avoid exposure of the PV chips, e.g., a multichip module
      (or MCM) triple junction chips with light they cannot convert (UV,
      and far IR). The inactive area between the chips is advantageously
      reduced by having triangular reflectors placed on the front
      electrodes and the connection mesh (not shown for clarity).<br>
      <br>
      [0158] A dispatched delivery scenario of electrical power by a
      CPVT system as contemplated herein can for example be briefly
      described, in reference to FIG. 18. FIG. 18 shows three curves,
      representing:<br>
      <br>
      [0159] Full line: the morning power demand peak and the evening
      demand peak;<br>
      <br>
      [0160] Dotted (gauss-like curve): a typical PV 2 hour design
      power, having a maximum around 13:00;<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Short-dashed: a typical CPV 6 hours design power; and<br>
      <br>
      [0162] Dash: an 8-9 hour design power, as can be achieved thanks
      to embodiments of the invention. An 8-9 hour design power can
      indeed be achieved, i.e., output power can now be maintained over
      8-9 hours instead of just 2 hours like for flat PV. In particular,
      the hybrid receiver can be moved out of the focal plane to reduce
      optical intensity, as explained earlier. A feedback loop can move
      the receiver back to the focal plane to compensate for temporary
      irradiation loss (e.g., light clouds) or to meet higher power
      output demand, as to be explained in more details in the next
      section. The excess energy is harvested as heat, thanks to the
      thermal collector and associated circuit and used to bridge the
      morning and evening peak demands, e.g., using a Rankin engine with
      stored hot (and pressurized) water (e.g., 150[deg.] C.). Depending
      on the actual size of the thermal collector, this temperature
      cannot be too large, otherwise this would lead to radiative losses
      from the large area thermal collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] More details as to operation methods and system description
      shall be given in the next section.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0164] Photovoltaic Thermal Hybrid Systems and Methods of
        Operation Thereof</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0165] The present section focuses on methods to operate
      photovoltaic thermal hybrid systems. An example of hybrid system
      10 is shown in FIG. 10. Some components of or variants to this
      system are depicted in FIGS. 1-9, 12-15, and 19-20.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] Referring to FIGS. 1-20 in general and in particular to
      FIG. 11, the methods generally rely on a system 10 comprising: a
      hybrid solar receiver 20 such as described in section 2.2, i.e.,
      wherein the receiver includes a photovoltaic module 21,
      operatively coupled to the system 10 to deliver an electrical
      output power PO, e.g., for a power user; and a thermal collector
      22 such as described in section 2.2 too. Importantly, for the
      purpose of implementing methods as described herein, the collector
      must be distinct (e.g., thermally insulated) from the photovoltaic
      module. In addition, the photovoltaic module and/or the thermal
      collector are/is movably mounted in the system (e.g., on a stage).<br>
      <br>
      [0167] The system further includes a collector thermal storage 42.
      As discussed earlier too, the latter is thermally connected to the
      thermal collector 22, typically via a closed-loop heat circuit 72,
      such that heat collected at the thermal collector can be stored in
      the storage 42. In this application, two components "thermally
      connected" means the same as two components "thermally coupled",
      i.e., heat can be exchanged from one component to the other.
      Finally, system 10 includes positioning mechanism 30, which are
      adapted to move the photovoltaic module and/or the thermal
      collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] Next, the operation methods include a step of instructing
      (FIG. 11, step S30) the positioning mechanism 30 to move the
      photovoltaic module 21 and/or the thermal collector 22 to change a
      radiation intensity ratio. The ratio compares intensity of
      radiation received (FIG. 11, step S10) at PV module 21 to
      intensity received (S10) at the collector 22. One understands that
      such methods can take advantage of devices such as described
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] Whether to instruct the positioning mechanism 30 to move
      the photovoltaic module 21 and/or the thermal collector 22 is
      typically decided at a control system/unit 100 such as depicted in
      FIG. 20. This control system/unit shall be described in detail in
      the next section. Note that decision S30 can be based on a power
      demand as calculated, predicted, etc. but could also be based on
      thermal demand (at least partly). A power demand is the power
      needed from the grid at a particular time, e.g. noon peak or
      evening peak.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] For instance, referring in particular to FIG. 11, data
      indicative of an electrical power demand PD may be received at a
      step S80. Decision S30 may then be carried out based on a
      comparison (steps S20, S22) of the PV output power PO (e.g., as
      delivered by the PV module) with the power demand.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] Note that in typical applications, power demand is AC
      whereas the output power is DC. Thus, the system 10 shall
      typically include an inverter 28, see FIG. 10, through which power
      is processed before delivery to power user. In case, indirect
      comparison might be needed (AC to DC), depending on the system's
      logic 100. In general, PD is always AC power. Since a DC/AC
      conversion ratio or calibration curve is usually known, it can
      easily be integrated in the feedback loop. Conversion may change
      with loading (e.g., 98% at 100% load and 96% at 50% load) but an
      exact calibration curve is usually available.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] In particular, decision S30 may be made to suitably move
      the PV module and/or collector to decrease the radiation intensity
      ratio if comparison S20 indicates that the output power PO is
      larger than the power demand PD. Indeed, if PO is larger than PD,
      it can be realized that leaving the configuration of the PV module
      vs. collector unchanged is sub-optimal. On the contrary, with a
      receiver 20 such as described above, the configuration of the
      receiver 20 can be altered to favor thermal collection instead of
      electrical power conversion.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] Now, it can be instructed (step S24) to deliver the output
      power PO generated by the PV module 21 to a power user, to meet
      the power demand PD if PO matches the power demand PD, based on
      the comparison carried out at steps S20, S22. In FIG. 11, Pd
      denotes the actually dispatched power (step S24, S57 or S52).
      Complete description of FIG. 11 shall be given later.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] Typically, such comparisons S20, S22 are subject to a
      tolerance, which depends on the system capacity, reactivity, etc.
      This tolerance can be adjusted empirically, e.g., based on
      trial-and-error process. Also, here again, consistent power values
      are compared (e.g., AC to AC).<br>
      <br>
      [0175] Additional components may be provided in the system 10 to
      further optimize it. For instance, system 10 may further include a
      heat engine 62, as depicted in FIGS. 14-15. The heat engine 62 is
      thermally connected to the collector thermal storage 42.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] In that case, present methods may further include steps of
      instructing (FIG. 11, steps S50, S56) the heat engine 62 to start
      a process of thermal-to-electrical conversion, to convert heat
      stored in the collector thermal storage 42. Whether to do so is
      typically decided based on comparisons S20, S22, i.e., if it turns
      out that PO is lower than the power demand PD.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] Note that the heat engine 62 can be any kind of
      thermal-to-electrical converter suited for the present purposes,
      e.g., to run a Rankine cycle, preferably an organic Rankine cycle
      (ORC), which uses an organic fluid such as n-pentane or toluene in
      place of water and steam. This allows for using lower-temperature
      heat sources, which typically operate at around 70-90[deg.] C.,
      but works still better at higher temperatures such as
      120-150[deg.] C. as presently contemplated. Suitable fluids can be
      chosen among Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC), Chlorofluorocarbons
      (CFC), Perfluorocarbons (PFC), Siloxanes, Alcohols, Aldehydes,
      Ethers, Hydrofluoroethers (HFE), Amines, Fluids mixtures
      (zeotropic and azeotropic), Inorganic fluids. Examples are:
      R245fa, R123, n-butane, n-pentane and R1234yf, Solkatherm, R134a,
      R600, carbon dioxide, R152a, R600a, R290, etc. A comparison of the
      critical temperatures of the fluids vs. optimal operation
      conditions of systems as contemplated herein allows for refining
      the choice. In particular, experiments conducted in the context of
      the present invention have shown that fluids R134a, followed by
      R152a, R600, R600a and R290 are most suitable fluids for
      low-temperature applications driven by heat source temperature
      below 90[deg.] C. In variants, a thermoelectric generator is
      relied upon, which converts heat to electrical power without
      working fluid and moving parts. Yet, thermoelectric generators
      currently have lower conversion efficiency for kW to MW sized
      converters.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] A control system (FIG. 20, ref. 100) with feedback loop is
      used to adapt the electrical power output to the actual demand
      required, e.g., by a grid control station. FIG. 11 shows an
      example of a main control process for a dispachable power mode. In
      this example, the generated electrical power is the main control
      variable and is adapted to the demand using the receiver
      positioning system. The positioning response is in the range of
      seconds, while the start of a Rankine cycle can be predicted and
      therefore kept with the same response time.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] Even more valuable than dispatched power is the function of
      grid services. A photovoltaic unit with motorized receivers can
      take this function when a feedback loop is closed between the
      phase angle [phi] in the grid (indicating the load situation) and
      the position of the receiver.<br>
      <br>
      [0180] The smaller the angle [phi] the more is the receiver moved
      away from the focus; the larger the angle [phi] the closer the
      receiver is moved to the receiver. Most valuable are grid services
      that can react very fast i.e. within seconds, a thing that can be
      achieved thanks to embodiments of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] In this respect, an inverter can switch off an input
      current in a matter of milliseconds, e.g., in a situation where
      the grid fails (lightning or physical damage). In this situation
      the receivers 20 can be moved to the minimum power position within
      a few seconds; power can thus be dissipated in open circuit
      voltage mode. The generated charges flow back in the PV diodes,
      adding thermal load to the microchannel cooler. Accordingly, no
      damage to the system is induced.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] Next, additional optimization to the system 10 can be
      achieved if the methods and systems integrate additional client
      processes. For instance, the method may further include steps of
      instructing (FIG. 11, step S42, S60) to trigger additional
      processes to dissipate heat from the collector thermal storage.
      This is preferably decided at step S42, if a heat storage
      threshold of the collector thermal storage 42 is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The additional processes are preferably a desalination
      process and/or an adsorption cooling process. More generally, a
      variety of client processes can be integrated, e.g., a free
      cooling process or a process to deliver heat for a chemical
      application and/or process, etc. However, it can be realized that
      combining present systems/methods with a desalination process or
      an adsorption (e.g., water adsorption) cooling process has more
      value in context such as contemplated in present embodiments,
      i.e., the higher the solar radiation levels, the more valued is
      the output of a desalination or a cooling process.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] Moreover, as depicted in FIG. 10, the system 10 may further
      include a first heat circuit 71 (typically closed-loop),
      connecting the PV module to a PV thermal storage 41, wherein the
      latter is distinct from the collector thermal storage 42. The PV
      thermal storage 41 and circuit 71 are used to cool the PV module
      (use can for instance be made of a cooling device 25 such as
      described in section 2.1). A second heat circuit 72 (typically
      closed-loop too) is also provided, distinct from the first heat
      circuit 71, which connects the collector thermal storage 42 to the
      thermal collector 22. Components 41, 42 also appear in FIGS. 14
      and 15.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] Note that in variants, the system may include a heat
      circuit connecting both the PV module and the thermal collector to
      a thermal storage, in series, such that fluid in a single heat
      circuit first reaches the photovoltaic module to cool it down and
      then reaches the thermal collector.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] Any of the heat circuits contemplated herein (a single heat
      circuit when using only one circuit or one of or both the two
      circuits when using distinct heat circuits) could additionally be
      used to cool any component in the system. Accordingly, part or all
      of the components that dissipate heat can be included in the loop,
      such as to contribute to the energy conversion efficiency of the
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0187] Next, the system may further include a heat exchanger 61,
      as shown in FIG. 14. The exchanger 61 is thermally connected to
      the PV storage 41. Accordingly, it can be instructed to provide
      heat stored in PV storage 41 to a thermal user 64, via the heat
      exchanger 61.<br>
      <br>
      [0188] Advantageously, heat exchanger 61 is further thermally
      connected to the collector thermal storage 42. In that case, it
      can be instructed to provide additional heat stored in the thermal
      collector storage 42 to the heat exchanger 61, while providing
      heat stored in the PV storage 41 to the thermal user 64, via
      exchanger 61.<br>
      <br>
      [0189] Heat exchanger 61 may actually include two heat exchangers
      in series: a first one lifts up temperature and a second one
      transfers heat to the user. The second heat exchanger can be an
      integral part of the thermal user 64.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] As i1lustrated in FIG. 14, the system 10 may further
      include an additional heat exchanger 63, thermally connected to
      heat engine 62 and thermal user 64.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] Advantageously, a thermal user 64 (desalination, adsorption
      heat pump) is furthermore thermally connected to the PV thermal
      storage 41. It can furthermore be connected to collector thermal
      storage 42, via heat exchanger 61. Then the method may
      additionally include a step of instructing (FIG. 11, S60) the heat
      engine to start a process of thermal-to-electrical conversion of
      heat stored in the collector thermal storage 42, using heat
      exchanger 63 as a low temperature pool.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] The additional heat exchanger 63 may be connected to the
      heat engine 62 and the thermal user 64 to provide the low
      temperature pool for the Rankine cycle. For example: a saline feed
      can be directly inputted to user 64 (step S64, FIG. 14), in which
      case the Rankine cycle may use air as a low temperature pool; or
      the saline feed may pass through heat exchanger 63 (preferred
      option, step S63, FIG. 14) and thus serves as the low temperature
      pool to increase a difference of temperature for the Rankine
      cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] At present, a complete description of the method of FIG. 11
      is given. FIG. 11 corresponds to a particular embodiment,
      combining many aspects of the methods discussed above:<br>
      <br>
      [0194] Step S10: solar radiation is received on the thermal
      collector and/or the PV module;<br>
      <br>
      [0195] Step S10: the actual PO is compared to the power demand PD,
      thanks to data relating to the a power demand as received at step
      S80 (e.g., power demand may vary rapidly; a corresponding data
      flow may be received and processed at unit 100, FIG. 20). In
      particular, if it appears that PO&gt;PD, the process goes to S30.
      As stated, this comparison is preferably subject to ad-hoc
      tolerance and possibly a timer, to avoid too frequent actuations.
      If this condition is not fulfilled (PO is not larger than PD), the
      process goes to S22;<br>
      <br>
      [0196] Step S30: as PO&gt;PD, positioning mechanism are instructed
      to move the photovoltaic module and/or the thermal collector, to
      decrease the radiation intensity ratio and thereby favor radiation
      collected at the thermal collector;<br>
      <br>
      [0197] Step S22: unit 100 tests whether PO PD, in which case PO
      can be dispatched, step S24, to meet the current power demand
      (PO=Pd). If not, the process goes to S50;<br>
      <br>
      [0198] Step S50: unit 100 checks whether heat stored in storage 42
      is sufficient to start a thermal-to-electrical conversion and
      thereby meet the power demand PD;<br>
      <br>
      [0199] Step S56: if yes, the thermal-to-electrical conversion
      process is started; electrical power accordingly produced can then
      be dispatched, step S57, to meet the current power demand. If
      necessary, the electrical power obtained by thermal-to-electrical
      conversion may be "added" to the PV power available PO to meet the
      demand. Yet, the "size" of the thermoelectrical converter shall
      typically be 10-20% of the maximal power that the CPVT system can
      deliver. This, in practice, is enough to satisfy demand overnight
      but not during day.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] Step S52: If not (i.e., if the heat stored in storage 42 is
      not sufficient to start a thermal-to-electrical conversion), then
      the process shall fail to meet the demand. Yet, the available PV
      power can nonetheless be delivered;<br>
      <br>
      [0201] Step S40: since at step S30, positioning mechanism may have
      moved the photovoltaic module and/or the thermal collector to
      favor radiation collected at the thermal collector, heat can
      conveniently be stored (step S40). The current level of heat as
      stored at S40 is used as input for S50;<br>
      <br>
      [0202] Step S42: on the other hand, if the storage capacity
      appears to be achieved (as monitored at S42), unit 100 may
      instruct to start an additional, client process (e.g., free
      cooling, desalination, adsorption cooling, etc.): the process goes
      to S60. Now, if the storage capacity is not achieved yet,
      additional heat can be stored, step S40.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] Following this principle, a particular efficient scenario
      is now described, referring notably to FIG. 14. Heat is collected
      from the microchannel cooler (FIG. 1-5, ref. 25) into a low grade
      heat tank 41 (FIG. 14), by way of heat circuit 71 (71i, 71o). Heat
      is further collected from the homogenizer 74 (FIG. 9) and thermal
      collector 22 (FIG. 9) into a high-grade heat tank 42 (FIG. 14),
      thanks to circuit 72 (72i, 72o). The low grade heat tank directly
      feeds power user, namely a desalination system (membrane
      distillation) 64. Additional heat exchanger 61 can lift the
      temperature using heat from the high grade tank when the low-grade
      heat tank is partially or fully depleted. The high grade heat tank
      feeds a Rankine process 62 to convert heat into electrical power
      with an efficiency of 20-30%. The low temperature pool is derived
      from the incoming salt water S63 or from an air cooler S64 (FIG.
      14).<br>
      <br>
      [0204] FIG. 15 shows another possible configuration for the system
      10, whose underlying scheme allows for managing both electrical
      power and water delivery on demand. FIG. 15 shows:<br>
      <br>
      [0205] The same components 20, 41, 42, 62 and 64 as in FIG. 14,
      except that the desalination system includes 64, 64a and 65.
      Reference 64 now corresponds to the desalination process, 64a is
      the corresponding feed of the process 64, and 65 refers to a
      desalination water storage. The desalination water storage 65 is
      connected to the desalination process 64 to provide water 66 on
      demand;<br>
      <br>
      [0206] A heat exchanger 63a, which is connected to feed 64a of the
      desalination system and to the Rankine process 62, itself
      connected to both storages 41 and 42 as before. Note that heat
      exchanger 63a in FIG. 15 plays a similar role as heat exchanger 63
      in FIG. 14;<br>
      <br>
      [0207] The first heat circuit 71 connects to the first storage 41
      as before. The circuit now branches to the desalination process 64
      (via circuit portion 71b), which is otherwise aided by the storage
      41 (via circuit portion 71c). Circuit portion 71c may include a
      heat exchanger, if needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] The above system allows for providing both electrical power
      10a and water delivery 66 on demand, making optimal use of high
      and low grade heat tanks.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] Methods as described hereinbefore are all the more
      efficient if the temperature in the collector thermal storage 42
      is substantially larger than the temperature in the PV thermal
      storage 41, i.e., more than 20[deg.] C. However, a temperature
      difference of more than 30[deg.] C. substantially improve
      performances of the systems. Ideally, temperatures differ by more
      than 50[deg.] C., a thing that can be achieved in embodiments as
      described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] The hybrid receiver 20 is preferably movably mounted in the
      system 10, such that positioning mechanism 30 can move the
      receiver 20 as a whole (e.g., the photovoltaic module and the
      thermal collector are not movable independently from each other by
      the positioning mechanism), by simple translation along the
      optical axis, as described in section 2.2. This substantially
      simplifies the design of the system. In addition, this allows for
      integrated solutions that efficiently capture heat dissipated by
      the various components of the receiver 20, e.g., via circuit 72.
      In turn, the temperature difference between the two circuits 71,
      72 can be optimized.<br>
      <br>
      [0211] In variants, only the thermal collector panel 22a could be
      moved (the PV module 21 is fixed). For instance: the thermal
      collector panel may consists of essentially a 2D arrangement of
      thermal circuits intermingled with an array of lenses, which
      collector can be moved more or less close to the fixed PV module.
      In addition, assuming a homogenous distribution of the radiation
      on the photovoltaic receiver, this latter can be moved relatively
      to the thermal receiver (or vice versa), in transverse direction
      to incoming radiation, to cover a section of the photovoltaic
      receiver and accordingly vary the energy captured in the thermal
      circuit vs. the PV circuit. Accordingly, there are various
      possible ways of embodying a photovoltaic module and/or a thermal
      collector movably mounted in the system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0212] Weather Predictions, Predicted Electricity and Water on
        Demand</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0213] The objective of some of the methods described herein is to
      provide electricity on demand and at the same time fulfill other
      core demands in a sunny location based on medium/high grade heat
      delivered by the solar CPVT receiver: e.g., desalinated water and
      cooling. Desalination and/or cooling can be operated directly or
      from stored heat. A sufficient temperature level for desalination
      and cooling can be reached thanks to the above methods. Hot water
      can be stored during high irradiance, i.e., exceeding the need for
      electricity. The coolant from the PV cooling unit is stored in the
      warm water tank 41 for later use at power users 64 (desalination
      and cooling). When more electrical energy is needed than available
      from the PV receiver, a low-pressure organic Rankine process 62 is
      activated. A microchannel heat exchanger 25 driven by the stored
      heat creates vapor that drives a turbine and produces electrical
      power.<br>
      <br>
      [0214] Electrical demand curves in most locations show a peak
      during noon and two smaller peaks in the morning and in the
      evening. The demand during the night is typically 10 times
      smaller. With an organic Rankine facility that is 10 times smaller
      than the peak photovoltaic output the night time demand, and
      together with the partial solar power the morning and evening
      peaks can be covered.<br>
      <br>
      [0215] In order to bridge the night about 30% of the daily thermal
      input is collected at a high temperature level and converted to
      electrical power by a high efficiency low temperature organic
      Rankine cycle. Heat is stored in a hot water tank during day,
      together with the lower ambient temperature at night the Rankine
      cycle can convert the heat into electrical power with a fairly
      good efficiency. The efficiency of the thermal-electrical
      conversion will be improved by use of the solar concentrators to
      radiate thermal energy to space at low or negative Centigrade
      temperatures. Since thermal desalination provides a relative value
      that is more than 30% of the electrical output, it can be realized
      that it is the ideal candidate for a controlled output power
      station. Thermal desalination processes can be easily regulated by
      a factor of four and delivery of desalinated water can be
      on-demand when a large output water storage tank is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0216] To allow a concentrated photovoltaic thermal system to
      store a week worth of energy for desalination and electrical
      energy generation at reasonable prices two separate storage tanks
      are needed: (i) a ~5000 m&lt;3 &gt;per MW warm water atmospheric
      pressure storage pool and a ~1000 m&lt;3 &gt;pressurized hot water
      storage tank. The warm water pool stores the 90[deg.] C. heated
      coolant from the PV microchannel coolers whereas the hot water
      tank stores the 150[deg.] C. coolant from the thermal collector
      (panel+homogenizer). In variants, a single low pressure tank with
      a volume of ~5000 m&lt;3 &gt;is needed for a sequential cooling
      system (circuits 71 and 72 in series) that operates at ~120[deg.]
      C. and 2 bars. The hot water storage can be used to drive a
      low-pressure organic Rankine engine whereas the warm water storage
      tank is used to drive the membrane desalination or adsorption
      cooling processes (FIG. 14). A heat exchanger is devised to extend
      the capacity of the warm water tank and the desalination capacity
      by a factor of two in case electrical demand is low. Both tanks
      use a layered storage approach to prevent temperature drops in
      partially filled tanks.<br>
      <br>
      [0217] More problematic are periods of bad (rainy) weather where
      the direct solar radiation is very small. Fortunately, the demand
      for desalinated water or cooling during these periods is
      negligible. This means the whole thermal storage can be converted
      to electricity using the organic Rankine facility. With improved
      computer modeling weather prediction has become accurate over a
      period of five days, i.e., a period for which thermal storage can
      be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0218] The efficiency of the thermal-electrical conversion will be
      improved by use of solar concentrators to radiate thermal energy
      to space at low or negative Centigrade temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0219] Referring to FIGS. 19 and 20: for areas with multiple solar
      power stations the stations that face the wind direction can serve
      as radiation predictors for the subsequent power stations. This
      allows a more accurate short term dispatching of the electrical
      power. For situations with upcoming larger clouds the desalination
      production is reduced in favor of thermal storage to have enough
      capacity for Rankine power generation. The control facility 100 to
      perform such functions can be automated. Movement speed and
      direction of clouds can be measured by detecting the covering
      speed and direction on the different receivers for an upcoming
      cloud. The measurement is performed by e.g., the quadrant detector
      that is already part of the two axis trackers. Such inputs are
      then fed into the control system 100 to determine the trajectory
      of the cloud and determine whether and when a neighboring power
      station will be affected. This monitoring can be performed
      continuously. Outside of the main production zone 300 scattered
      "metrology" receiver arrays 301-303 are placed that may supply
      single houses or small villages but mainly serve as "early
      warning" stations for the appropriate dispatching strategy of the
      main power stations. These arrays have to be large enough to be
      able to detect cloud speed and direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0220] Next, the control system 100 can be designed to tune the
      buffered energy corresponding to weather predictions. The
      capability planning of the power-station is now coupled with
      weather forecast. Before a predicted rainfall, desalination can be
      reduced to accumulate heat for production of electricity, in order
      to bridge the absence of direct solar radiation during the
      rainfall period. This is easily compensated due to the lower
      demand for water during rainy periods. Accumulation of heat and
      expansion of thermal storage is accomplished by running the
      coolant hotter through the CPVT to sacrifice electrical yield.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0221] Specific Implementation Details</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0222] Many optional features can be contemplated, some of which
      have already been evoked above. To start with, the thermal
      collector 22 and PV module 21 may be embodied such as described in
      section 2.2. Similarly, the receiver may further include minor
      elements 74, such as depicted in FIGS. 6-7. The latter are
      provided in an intermediate section 75 (FIG. 9) and preferably
      thermally connected to the collector thermal storage 42, by a same
      circuit 72 that connects the thermal collector 22 to the collector
      thermal storage 42. The receiver may also include: a band pass
      filter 76 as described in section 2.2; a concentrator (FIG. 10,
      27, 27a, 27b, 271) having any of the features described in section
      2.2.<br>
      <br>
      [0223] Concerning operation methods: the feedback algorithm could
      also be based on thermal demand, to produce water, refrigeration
      or feed another thermal process, and not only on the power demand.
      In addition, a Rankine engine can run forward and backward, to
      help to "pump" up the stored heat. Reversible Rankine engine can
      contribute to grid services, which allows for using the investment
      in the Rankine engine longer and with better value.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0224] Additional Technical Implementation Details</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0225] Finally, FIG. 20 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a
      computerized unit suitable for implementing aspects of the present
      invention. It will be appreciated that the methods described
      herein are largely non-interactive and automated. In exemplary
      embodiments, the methods described herein can be implemented
      either in an interactive, partly-interactive or non-interactive
      system. The methods described above can be partly implemented in
      software (e.g., firmware), hardware, or a combination thereof. In
      exemplary embodiments, the methods described herein are
      implemented in software, as an executable program, and is executed
      by a special or general-purpose digital computer, such as a
      personal computer, workstation, minicomputer, or mainframe
      computer. The system 100 therefore includes general-purpose
      computer 101.<br>
      <br>
      [0226] In exemplary embodiments, in terms of hardware
      architecture, as shown in FIG. 20, the computer 101 includes a
      processor 105, memory 110 coupled to a memory controller 115, and
      one or more input and/or output (I/O) devices 140, 145 (or
      peripherals) that are communicatively coupled via a local
      input/output controller 135. The input/output controller 135 can
      be, but is not limited to, one or more buses or other wired or
      wireless connections, as is known in the art. The input/output
      controller 135 may have additional elements, which are omitted for
      simplicity, such as controllers, buffers (caches), drivers,
      repeaters, and receivers, to enable communications. Further, the
      local interface may include address, control, and/or data
      connections to enable appropriate communications among the
      aforementioned components. As described herein the I/O devices
      140, 145 can be any generalized cryptographic card or smart card
      known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0227] The processor 105 is a hardware device for executing
      software, particularly that stored in memory 110. The processor
      105 can be any custom made or commercially available processor, a
      central processing unit (CPU), an auxiliary processor among
      several processors associated with the computer 101, a
      semiconductor based microprocessor (in the form of a microchip or
      chip set), a macroprocessor, or generally any device for executing
      software instructions.<br>
      <br>
      [0228] The memory 110 can include any one or combination of
      volatile memory elements (e.g., random access memory, RAM, such as
      DRAM, SRAM, SDRAM, etc.) and nonvolatile memory elements (e.g.,
      ROM, erasable programmable read only memory (EPROM),
      electronically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM),
      programmable read only memory (PROM), tape, compact disc read only
      memory (CD-ROM), disk, diskette, cartridge, cassette or the like,
      etc.). Moreover, the memory 110 may incorporate electronic,
      magnetic, optical, and/or other types of storage media. Note that
      the memory 110 can have a distributed architecture, where various
      components are situated remote from one another, but can be
      accessed by the processor 105.<br>
      <br>
      [0229] The software in memory 110 may include one or more separate
      programs, each of which includes an ordered listing of executable
      instructions for implementing logical functions. In the example of
      FIG. 20, the software in the memory 110 includes methods described
      herein in accordance with exemplary embodiments and a suitable
      operating system (OS) 111. The OS 111 essentially controls the
      execution of other computer programs, such as the methods as
      described herein, and provides scheduling, input-output control,
      file and data management, memory management, and communication
      control and related services.<br>
      <br>
      [0230] The methods described herein may be in the form of a source
      program, executable program (object code), script, or any other
      entity comprising a set of instructions to be performed. When in a
      source program form, then the program needs to be translated via a
      compiler, assembler, interpreter, or the like, which may or may
      not be included within the memory 110, so as to operate properly
      in connection with the OS 111. Furthermore, the methods can be
      written as an object oriented programming language, which has
      classes of data and methods, or a procedure programming language,
      which has routines, subroutines, and/or functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0231] In exemplary embodiments, a conventional keyboard 150 and
      mouse 155 can be coupled to the input/output controller 135. Other
      output devices such as the I/O devices 140, 145 may include input
      devices, for example but not limited to a printer, a scanner,
      microphone, and the like. Finally, the I/O devices 140, 145 may
      further include devices that communicate both inputs and outputs,
      for instance but not limited to, a network interface card (NIC) or
      modulator/demodulator (for accessing other files, devices,
      systems, or a network), a radio frequency (RF) or other
      transceiver, a telephonic interface, a bridge, a router, and the
      like. As described herein the I/O devices 140, 145 can be any
      generalized cryptographic card or smart card known in the art. The
      system 100 can further include a display controller 125 coupled to
      a display 130. In exemplary embodiments, the system 100 can
      further include a network interface 160 for coupling to a network
      165. The network 165 can be an IP-based network for communication
      between the computer 101 and external servers or clients and the
      like via a broadband connection. The network 165 transmits and
      receives data between the computer 101 and external systems 300,
      301, 302, 303. In exemplary embodiments, network 165 can be a
      managed IP network administered by a service provider. The network
      165 may be implemented in a wireless fashion, e.g., using wireless
      protocols and technologies, such as WiFi, WiMax, etc. The network
      165 can also be a packet-switched network such as a local area
      network, wide area network, Internet network, or other type of
      network environment. The network 165 may be a fixed wireless
      network, a wireless local area network (LAN), a wireless wide area
      network (WAN) a personal area network (PAN), a virtual private
      network (VPN), intranet or other suitable network system and
      includes equipment for receiving and transmitting signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0232] If the computer 101 is a PC, workstation, intelligent
      device or the like, the software in the memory 110 may further
      include a basic input output system (BIOS) (omitted for
      simplicity). The BIOS is stored in ROM so that the BIOS can be
      executed when the computer 101 is activated.<br>
      <br>
      [0233] When the computer 101 is in operation, the processor 105 is
      configured to execute software stored within the memory 110, to
      communicate data to and from the memory 110, and to generally
      control operations of the computer 101 pursuant to the software.
      The methods described herein and the OS 111, in whole or in part
      are read by the processor 105, perhaps buffered within the
      processor 105, and then executed.<br>
      <br>
      [0234] When aspects of the systems and methods described herein
      are implemented in software, as is shown in FIG. 11, the methods
      can be stored on any computer readable medium, such as storage
      120, for use by or in connection with any computer related system
      or method.<br>
      <br>
      [0235] As will be appreciated by one skilled in the art, aspects
      of the present invention may be embodied as a system, method or
      computer program product. Accordingly, the aspects may take the
      form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software
      embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code,
      etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects
      that may all generally be referred to herein as a "circuit,"
      "module" or "system." Furthermore, aspects of the present
      invention may take the form of a computer program product embodied
      in one or more computer readable medium(s) having computer
      readable program code embodied thereon.<br>
      <br>
      [0236] Any combination of one or more computer readable medium(s)
      may be utilized. The computer readable medium may be a computer
      readable signal medium or a computer readable storage medium. A
      computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but not
      limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic,
      infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, or device, or any
      suitable combination of the foregoing. More specific examples (a
      non-exhaustive list) of the computer readable storage medium would
      include the following: an electrical connection having one or more
      wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access
      memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable
      read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a
      portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical
      storage device, a magnetic storage device, or any suitable
      combination of the foregoing. In the context of this document, a
      computer readable storage medium may be any tangible medium that
      can contain, or store a program for use by or in connection with
      an instruction execution system, apparatus, or device.<br>
      <br>
      [0237] A computer readable signal medium may include a propagated
      data signal with computer readable program code embodied therein,
      for example, in baseband or as part of a carrier wave. Such a
      propagated signal may take any of a variety of forms, including,
      but not limited to, electro-magnetic, optical, or any suitable
      combination thereof. A computer readable signal medium may be any
      computer readable medium that is not a computer readable storage
      medium and that can communicate, propagate, or transport a program
      for use by or in connection with an instruction execution system,
      apparatus, or device.<br>
      <br>
      [0238] Program code embodied on a computer readable medium may be
      transmitted using any appropriate medium, including but not
      limited to wireless, wireline, optical fiber cable, RF, etc., or
      any suitable combination of the foregoing.<br>
      <br>
      [0239] Computer program code for carrying out operations for
      aspects of the present invention may be written in any combination
      of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented
      programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like and
      conventional procedural programming languages, such as the "C"
      programming language or similar programming languages. The program
      code may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the
      user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the
      user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the
      remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote
      computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type
      of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area
      network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external
      computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet
      Service Provider).<br>
      <br>
      [0240] Aspects of the present invention are described above with
      reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of
      methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products
      according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood
      that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block
      diagrams can be implemented by computer program instructions.
      These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor
      of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other
      programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such
      that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the
      computer or other programmable data processing apparatus,
      implement the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or
      block diagram block or blocks.<br>
      <br>
      [0241] The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a
      computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other
      devices to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on
      the computer, other programmable apparatus or other devices to
      produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions
      which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus
      provide processes for implementing the functions/acts specified in
      the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.<br>
      <br>
      [0242] The flowchart/block diagrams in FIGS. 11, 14 and 15
      illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of
      possible implementations of systems, involving methods and
      computer program products according to embodiments. In this
      regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may
      represent a module, segment, or portion of code, which includes
      one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified
      logical function(s). It should also be noted that, in some
      alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may
      occur out of the order noted in the figures. For example, two
      blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially
      concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the
      reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will
      also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or
      flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block
      diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by
      special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified
      functions or acts, or combinations of special purpose hardware and
      computer instructions.<br>
      <br>
      [0243] While the present invention has been described with
      reference to certain embodiments, it will be understood by those
      skilled in the art that various changes may be made and
      equivalents may be substituted without departing from the scope of
      the present invention. In addition, many modifications may be made
      to adapt a particular situation to the teachings of the present
      invention without departing from its scope. Therefore, it is
      intended that the present invention not be limited to the
      particular embodiment disclosed, but that the present invention
      will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the
      appended claims. For example: various other manifold layer
      designs/dimensions/materials could be relied upon for the cooling
      devices; various other shapes/dimensions can be contemplated for
      the thermal panels of the thermal collectors;<br>

      [0244] Additional components (beyond components mentioned in the
      present specification) may be inserted in the systems of FIGS. 10,

      A photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar receiver includes a thermal
      collector, extending in a first plane and comprising an aperture;
      and a photovoltaic module, configured for electrical output power
      delivery, comprising a photo-active area that extends in a second
      plane at a distance from the first plane, the photo-active area
      being vis-à-vis the aperture, a projection of the aperture
      perpendicularly to the second plane corresponding to the
      photo-active area.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention generally relates to photovoltaic
      thermal hybrid solar receivers and apparatuses.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Definitions of certain terms discussed herein are as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Photovoltaics (PV) generate electrical power by converting
      solar radiation into direct current electricity through
      semiconductors exhibiting the photovoltaic effect;<br>
      <br>
      [0005] A photovoltaic cell (or PV cell, also "solar cell" or
      "photoelectric cell") is a solid state device that converts energy
      of light directly into electricity by virtue if the photovoltaic
      effect;<br>
      <br>
      [0006] A photovoltaic module (also "solar module", "solar panel"
      or "photovoltaic panel") is an assembly of connected photovoltaic
      cells;<br>
      <br>
      [0007] A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of
      photovoltaic modules, an inverter and interconnection wiring;<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A thermal collector (also "solar thermal collector")
      collects heat by absorbing radiations, such as sunlight;<br>
      <br>
      [0009] A heat exchanger is a device/piece of equipment to
      efficiently transfer heat from one medium to another;<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In electronic systems, a heat sink is a component to cool a
      device by dissipating heat into a surrounding medium;<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Solar thermal energy (STE) concerns technologies for
      harnessing solar energy for thermal energy (heat). STE differs
      from and is acknowledged to be much more efficient than
      photovoltaics, which converts solar energy directly into
      electricity;<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Concentrated solar power (also "concentrating solar power"
      or CSP) systems use mirrors or lenses that concentrate a large
      area of solar thermal energy onto a small area, such that
      electrical power (also "power") can be produced when concentrated
      light is converted to heat, which drives a heat engine (e.g., a
      steam turbine) connected to a power generator. Common forms of
      concentration are: parabolic trough, dish Stirlings, concentrating
      linear Fresnel reflector and solar power tower.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) systems use optics (e.g.,
      lenses) to concentrate a large amount of sunlight onto a small
      area of solar photovoltaic materials to generate electricity.
      Concentration allows for production of smaller areas of solar
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] CPV should not to be confused with CSP: in CSP concentrated
      sunlight is converted to heat, and then heat is converted to
      electricity, whereas in CPV concentrated sunlight is converted
      directly to electricity using the photovoltaic effect;<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Photovoltaic thermal hybrid solar collectors (also "hybrid
      PV/T systems" or PVT) are systems converting solar radiation into
      thermal and electrical energy. Such systems combine a photovoltaic
      cell, which converts photons into electricity, with a solar
      thermal collector, which captures the remaining energy and removes
      waste heat from the PV module. Two categories of PVT collectors
      are generally known:<br>
      <br>
      [0016] PV/T fluid collector (air or liquid). In liquid collectors,
      a typical water-cooled design uses conductive-metal piping or
      plates attached to the back of a PV module. The working fluid is
      typically water or glycol. The heat from the PV cells are
      conducted through the metal and absorbed by the working fluid,
      which assumes that the working fluid is cooler than the operating
      temperature of the cells. In closed-loop systems this heat is
      either exhausted (to cool it) or transferred at a heat exchanger,
      where it flows to its application. In open-loop systems, this heat
      is used, or exhausted before the fluid returns to the PV cells;<br>
      <br>
      [0017] PV/T concentrator (CPVT), wherein a concentrating system is
      provided to reduce the amount of solar cells needed. CPVT can
      reach very good solar thermal performance compared to flat PV/T
      collectors. However, main obstacles to CPVT are to provide good
      cooling of the solar cells and a durable tracking system.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A disadvantage of PV systems compared to other energy
      sources is the unpredictable nature of the direct solar radiation.
      This leads to intermittent power delivery, which has much less
      value than on demand power and leads to grid instabilities.
      Storage of electrical energy in e.g. batteries is prohibitively
      expensive so that the cost for a storage unit for a full day
      production costs much more than the solar power station.
      Concentrated solar power systems (CSP) that can store the
      collected heat can produce electricity on demand until the stored
      heat is dissipated. Concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) power plants
      have higher conversion efficiencies than PV and CSP but still
      suffer from intermittent power production. Concentrated
      photovoltaic thermal (CPVT) systems have a higher system
      efficiency because of the improved cooling but reject the heat to
      the ambient or produce low grade heat with limited utility.<br>

      The invention is notably directed to an integrated circuit package
      (10c). Said package has a layer structure with ICs and electrodes
      (17) arranged in electrical connection with a layer (16) of the
      layer structure. The package further comprises one or more fluid
      circuit sections (19), each meant to receive a respective
      electrolyte solution (or two distinct solutions, see the dual flow
      redox mode described below). Each solution involved has soluble
      electroactive species. A fluid section is designed to receive and
      allow an electrolyte solution to contact corresponding electrodes,
      such as to supply power to the ICs, in operation. As electrodes
      are integrated to the package, electrical power can be supplied
      close to the ICs, thereby improving efficiency of the power
      supply. Finally, as a liquid is involved in-situ, suitable heat
      removal can be contemplated, it being noted that electrical power
      delivery and heat removal needs are congruent.<br>
