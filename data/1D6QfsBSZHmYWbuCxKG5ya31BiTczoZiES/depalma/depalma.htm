          </center>
          <p><b>Bruce Eldridge De Palma</b> (1935-1997), son of noted
            orthopaedic surgeon Anthony DePalma and elder brother of
            film director Brian De Palma, was a well known figure in the
            Free energy suppression community. He claimed that his
            N-machine Homopolar generator, a device based on the Faraday
            disc, could produce five times the energy required to run
            it. According to mainstream physics, no such device is
            physically possible. </p>
          <p>De Palma studied electrical engineering at Harvard (1958)
            and taught physics at MIT for 15 years, working under Harold
            Eugene Edgerton. He was also employed by Edwin H. Land of
            Polaroid fame. </p>
          <p>Bruce De Palma's development of the <b>N-machine</b>
            concept in 1977, among his other anomalous devices (at least
            one of which, De Palma claimed, displayed anti-gravity
            characteristics) and the claims surrounding them, set him on
            a collision course with his more mainstream peers. His
            claims of 'free energy' were vigorously refuted over the
            course of twenty years, by conventional scientists and some
            members of the alternative energy community alike. </p>
          <p>His search for financial backing for the construction of a
            marketable N-machine saw him relocate from Santa Barbara,
            California to Australia c. 1994, and then New Zealand in
            1996. </p>
          <p>Probably his greatest ally in his conviction that the
            N-machine could solve the world's energy and environmental
            crisis was Paramahamsa Tewari, a Project Director with the
            Indian Nuclear Power Corporation, with whom he corresponded
            regularly over many years. Tewari's Space Power Generator,
            claimed to be 200% efficient, is based on the same
            theoretical foundations as the N-machine. </p>
          <p>De Palma's death in New Zealand in October 1997 put an end
            to his most ambitious free energy project, and occurred only
            weeks prior to the official testing of a device constructed
            over the course of 6 months in an Auckland workshop. The
            test was attended by, among others, the project's financial
            backer, Bruce Bornholdt, a prominent Wellington barrister,
            as well as the pioneering developer of the Adams Motor,
            Robert Adams, who observed the operation of, and measured
            electrical output from, the N-machine. This single test
            failed to demonstrate the over-unity potential of the
            N-machine, most of the output energy being lost as heat, and
            the project was immediately dissolved.</p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The extraction of energy
          directly from space has been suggested as a viable process for
          the solution of the energy problems of society. The
          accessibility of this energy has been limited by the necessity
          for the formulation of new energy paradigms. In the past,
          energy in space has been suggested by thoughts such as Orgone,
          Od, Prana, Bio-cosmic, Neutrino energy sea and so on, but the
          useful extraction of such energies has always awaited more
          explicit formulations of these ideas which could suggest the
          construction of simple practical energy extraction machinery.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Variable Inertial Mass</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experiments performed by
          this author have suggested a picture of space which is
          perfused with a "fine substance". This concept is one which
          lies between the ineffability of a space-time construct such
          as Einstein and the tangibility of gross matter. The important
          part about this "fine substance" is that it is shown that this
          substance confers inertia on physical objects. The substance
          of inertia can also be shown to have the property of
          polarization.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Normally the inertial mass
          of an object is anisotropic --- that is to say, an inertial
          measurement performed by applying a force vector to the object
          and measuring the resulting acceleration; the inertial mass
          obtained in this measurement would be a constant independent
          of the direction of the applied force vector. The important
          discovery is that the inertial mass of a rotating object
          becomes polarized and anisotropic --- in terms of the real
          behavior of a rotating object the inertial mass is found to
          increase for measurements performed in the direction of the
          axis of rotation, and perforce the inertial mass is found to
          decrease for measurements made in the direction of the plane
          of rotation. Complete inertial polarization of the rotating
          object takes place when the inertial mass taken in the
          direction of the plane of rotation of the test object
          decreases to zero with increasing rotational speed.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The "N" Effect</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The interesting combination
          would be to combine the effects of inertial and magnetic
          polarization for the extraction of electrical energy directly
          from space.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With reference to the two
          diagrams, Figure A and Figure B, the "N" effect is
          demonstrated quite simply. A cylindrical bar magnet of alnico
          or other magnetized electrical conductor as shown is rotated
          around an axis passing through the two magnetic poles and
          perpendicular to the polished pole faces as shown. What is
          found is a cylindrically symmetrical electric field is
          established within the magnet through rotation. Electrical
          current is simply extracted by placing the probes or sliding
          contacts of the appropriate ammeters and voltmeters, one on
          the axis of rotation and the other on the outer surface of the
          rotating magnetized conductor.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The "N" Machine</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to make full use of
          the current capabilities of an N generator and to accommodate
          the use of non-conducting "ferrite" permanent magnets or
          electromagnets, an N-machine is constructed as in Figure B.
          The N-machine utilizes a copper or bronze conducting shaft and
          disc and ferrite ring magnets cemented together as shown. A
          typical machine constructed with ordinary loudspeaker ring
          magnets of dimensions o.d. 2-7/8", i.d. 1-1/3" and ½"
          thickness, two of each epoxy-cemented on either side of a
          conducting disc 1/8" thick, delivers 30 millivolts at 3450
          rpm. The field strength of the magnets as supplied is about
          1000 gauss. The current obtainable from the machine is limited
          only by the resistance of the leads and sliding contacts.
          Since the aforementioned 30 mv can be developed across a heavy
          copper wire shunt of resistance less than .001 ohm, a current
          in excess of 30 amperes is developed by this simple toy.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electrical energy developed
          out of centrifugal extraction of the electrical positive and
          negative poles from the free energy field of space is supplied
          in useful and controllable form from N generators which are
          scaled in order to supply requirements. Experiments show the
          voltage polarity depends on the sense of rotation. Output
          voltage goes directly as speed and magnetic field strength.
          Geometrically the output voltage increases as the square of
          the machine radius, r<sup>2</sup>.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Discussion</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was in the 1830s that
          Michael Faraday working in the basement of what is now the
          Royal technical College in London, discovered that a
          conducting disc held between the poles of a magnet with the
          lines of force perpendicular to the surface, would generate
          current if rotated and the current extracted between the
          center and the edge of the rotating conducting disc.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conversely, if a voltage
          were applied between the center and the edge of such a disc it
          would rotate as a motor. These effects are presently known as
          the Faraday unipolar dynamo and Faraday motor respectively.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If Faraday had rotated the
          whole combination, magnets and disc together, he would have
          discovered as this author did in 1977 that the voltage output
          remained constant regardless of whether the disc was rotating
          independently of the magnets or not. Of course, if Maxwell or
          Faraday had known of the "N" effect, things would have been
          different. But it is probably true that such a discovery had
          to wait until the availability of strong, lightweight
          permanent magnets, a development that didn’t take place until
          the 1930s.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What is important about the
          N machine is that unlike a conventional generator which
          exhibits a rotational drag when current is drawn, an N
          generator exhibits no such drag.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All of the currently used
          electrical generation rotating machinery has the property of
          being both motors and generators simultaneously. That is to
          say, an electrical machine which is used as a generator will
          operate as a motor when excited with the appropriate voltages
          and currents. With the foregoing in mind, we interpret the
          situation as follows.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the conventional
          electrical power generation system we have an electrical
          generator coupled to an engine of some kind which supplies
          mechanical power which is interpreted in accord with present
          understanding to be converted from mechanical to electrical
          energy with a conversion efficiency not to exceed 100%. If we
          were to suppose however that that the energy obtained was
          extracted from some heretofore unsuspected property of
          magnetism; then it is simply apparent that the slowing down of
          the drive engine is due to the “generator” having the aspect
          of a motor also, and that is the slowing of the drive engine
          with electrical load is simply the effect of the motor aspect
          of the generator energized by the load current. The generator
          being a motor also elicits a torque output in opposition to
          the drive engine torque. This is why an engine-generator
          combination slows down when an electrical load is thrown on
          the generator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An N generator is only a
          generator and does not possess the dual aspects of presently
          used machines. Electrical loading of an N generator produces
          an internal torque between the conducting electrical disc and
          the attached ring magnets. However, since they are firmly
          cemented together, this torque cannot escape from the machine
          and load the drive motor or engine. Thus the N machine is a
          non-reciprocal machine, which, if a voltage were applied to it
          in the fashion of motor excitation between the center and the
          edge of the conducting disc, no motor action could result
          since the generated torque is constrained within the body of
          the machine.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Directions for Future
            Work</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The discovery of a new
          physical phenomenon, the N effect, which relates phenomena of
          magnetism, inertia, and rotation together in a new machine for
          the liberation of electrical energy directly from space is a
          pregnant development of a new age in science which will
          energize the civilization of the 21st century. Although many
          ideas may have suggested themselves in the minds of the
          readers of this information, I would like to suggest a few
          possibilities which have occurred to this author in the time
          that he has been working and experimenting with N generators
          of various kinds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1.&nbsp; <i>Control of Very
            High Currents at Low Voltage</i>: Simple calculations will
          show the N generator to be characterized as a very high
          current, low voltage electrical generation machine. For the
          sizes and rotational speeds normally associated with
          conventional automotive or electrical traction purposes it is
          easy to show that voltages of up to 100 or so vdc can be
          generated at currents limited only by the brush technology and
          the machine internal resistance. Standard texts detail methods
          whereby high currents have been conducted through liquid
          conducting metal electrodes. In this fashion, currents of
          50,000 amperes have been conducted from Faraday unipolar
          generators for the excitation of ultra-high field strength
          magnets for physical experiments (Francis Bitter Magnet
          Laboratory Publication, MIT, Cambridge, MA).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The important fact about the
          N generator is that once the appropriate brush technology has
          been adopted for the ultra-high currents, the control of the
          voltage becomes very simple. The N generator is constructed as
          an N machine with the permanent magnets replaced by a pair of
          electromagnets on either side of the conducting disc.
          Excitation of the electromagnets can vary the N generator
          output from zero to full in either polarity. Thus a current of
          thousands of amperes can be controlled in voltage and polarity
          by a few amperes or less of excitation current necessary to
          saturate the electromagnets in the chosen direction of
          magnetization.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is easy to see that ac
          operation is possible if the electromagnets age built o
          laminations stacked in a cylindrical build with the direction
          of easy magnetization parallel to the axis of rotation of the
          machine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2. <i>Self-Contained Power
            Generation Systems</i>: Since the N generator can generate
          many times the power needed to overcome bearing friction,
          windage losses and frictional losses in sliding contacts, the
          N generator can be combined with an electrical drive motor
          forming a self-sustaining combination. Reflection will show
          the appropriate motor for such a purpose is a Faraday motor; a
          simple copper disc rotor between the poles of strong field
          magnets. The ultra-low voltage, high current characteristics
          of this machine combine perfectly with the low voltage, high
          current output of the N generator. Such a combination, an N
          generator on a common shaft with a Faraday motor, with the
          motor excited with a fraction of the generator output
          regulated through an appropriate series resistor (to prevent
          machine speed runaway) forms a power generation system. The
          basic power generation system then consists of a
          self-sustaining combination of N generator and Faraday motor
          which provides a mechanical and an electrical output.</font> </p>

        <p><img src="dp3.gif" height="370" width="471"></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An interesting line of
          development begins here since once the basic power generation
          system is constructed the mechanical output can be used to
          drive conventional generators -- which may be to some
          advantage since these machines are presently articles of
          commerce and can deliver higher output voltages than the basic
          dc generator. The point of all this is that once the free
          energy is liberated from space and converted into rotational
          form by a combination N generator-Faraday motor, the resultant
          energy is directly applicable economically, and with known
          conventional technology and machines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3. <i>Inertial Guidance</i>:
          The N generator concept of the direct centrifugal extraction
          of the electrical poles from the spatial energy field has
          direct application to the field of inertial guidance. It is
          not necessary to have sliding contacts if the N generator is
          to be used to sense do/dt. Wires can be soldered to the ends
          of a diameter of an N generator disc and a voltage obtained
          between the two diametrical ends connected together and at the
          center. The polarity of this voltage will reflect the sense of
          rotation and its magnitude will be proportional to do/dt.
          Appropriate integrators on the output of a 3-axis combination
          will provide all the information necessary for an inertial
          guidance system replacing cumbersome mechanical gyroscopes
          spinning at fantastic speeds together with excessively
          sophisticated and expensive ancillary mechanical and
          electrical instrumentation.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusion</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The powerful physical
          principle resulting from the interaction of rotation, inertia,
          and magnetism, for the liberation of unlimited controlled
          energy directly from the energy medium of space, the N effect,
          opens the door to the continued social development of a
          society freed from the limitation of the present energy
          conservation paradigm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Freedom from the limitations
          imposed by the present formulations, the so-called Laws of
          Physics, is important since it allows the upward spiraling of
          free thought which eventually expresses itself in new forms of
          machinery. In terms of 1979 science, it is an unexpected
          pleasure to be reminded that the present closed system of
          equations of electricity, Maxwells’ equations, do not
          represent all there is to know about electricity and
          magnetism.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Laws of Thermodynamics
          and the so-called conservation of energy relationships are 150
          years old. Of course, the discovery of the inertial anisotropy
          of rotating objects taken together with new information this
          author has elicited regarding the elastic collisions of
          rotating objects impacting on identical non-rotating controls
          -- free energy is liberated in the collision of a rotating
          object with a non-rotating one [sic]. New information such as
          this imposes new degrees of freedom in the thermodynamic
          interactions of colliding atoms and will help explain much of
          the anomalous new information which is being accumulated in
          the present search for more "efficient" ways of liberating or
          extracting energy from Nature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A thorough intelligent
          analysis of the N generator will show that to produce any
          voltage whatsoever, such a combination of magnets and a
          conducting disc in rotation as shown, invalidates the physical
          interpretations of Newton and Einstein, special relativity and
          general relativity. The loss of these ideas I do not regard as
          a terribly great tragedy since in their overcoming we shall
          eventually perfect the anti-gravity spacedrive and will send
          humans to the stars. In this short paper I can only suggest
          some of these ideas.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Closer to what is at hand, I
          would like to suggest that the presently conceived ideas
          regarding the operation of the magnetron radio frequency
          transmitting tube can be re-examined in the light of the N
          effect. In such a tube a rotating disc electronic cloud
          excites a series of resonant chambers around its periphery at
          microwave frequencies. The very high power microwave impulses
          obtained in this way form the basis of radar transmitters in
          current use.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Interpreting the magnetron
          operation as a higher order property of the Faraday unipolar
          dynamo, we can suspect that we might be able to obtain ac
          excitation of a series resonant LC circuit connected between
          any two separate points on the periphery of a rotating N
          generator conducting disc. For most of us who have spent our
          lives in the conventional applications of electricity and
          electrical rotating machinery, it may be enlightening to
          obtain alternating current in this way. What is important is,
          anyone can say that a certain formulation or set of ideas in
          invalid, i.e., the Einstein geometrical interpretation of
          space. The important thing is what we have to offer in terms
          of new machinery, i.e., free energy or anti-gravity to
          substantiate new ideas.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experiments performed by
          this author have obtained 2-3 millivolts ac (p-p) generated in
          this way employing a 1 microfarad capacitor in series with the
          appropriate inductance to obtain a resonance between 100 and
          600 cps. In consideration of the utilization of this effect
          for the generation of megawatt power levels at powerline
          frequencies (60 cps) the size of the components becomes
          important since a resonant circuit must be employed in
          conjunction with the N generator. The L and C elements would
          have to be fabricated to reach the megawatt power levels with
          suitably low internal impedance. Such limitations do not
          appear to assert themselves at the magnetron operating
          frequencies, so the possibility of the liberation of megawatt
          power levels of microwave power radiation from an N machine in
          a UHF cavity suggests itself.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Without becoming prolix it
          is interesting to consider all the ramifications of the
          electricity which originally was known in the Galvanic wet
          cell or the lightning arrestor. Now pictures are sent through
          the "air" (television), and sound is recorded (magnetism).
          Many other things are done. We live in an age where the
          conceptualization of such a development has taken place in
          many fields. Thus there is some basis for understanding of the
          possiblilities which can result from the evolution of a new
          basis of understanding. With this in main, I have tried to
          indicate what some of the thoughts I have had have led me to
          in consideration of the newly discovered inertial anisotropy
          of rotating objects and the interaction of magnetism and
          rotation, the N effect.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The spinning ball experiment
          consists of the observation of the interaction of
          gravitational and inertia forces on a rotating material
          object.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the interaction of
          material force on a rotating physical object, four experiments
          are possible:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) Inertial forces acting on
          non-rotating material objects in field-free space;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) Inertial forces acting on
          rotating material objects in field-free space;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3) Inertial forces acting on
          non-rotating material objects in a gravitational field;</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">4) Inertial forces acting on
          rotating material objects in a gravitational field.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Discussion of the
            Experiments</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In experiments (1) and (2),
          we would expect the normal inertial forces summarized by
          Newton’s Laws of mechanical motion. In experiment (3), there
          is reason to believe there will be (supported by experimental
          evidence), a slight enhancement of inertia by the
          gravitational field. The cases of experiments (2) and (4) have
          not been adequately treated in the literature.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Behavior of Rotating
            Material Objects</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Certain theoretical
          considerations justified the belief by the author that the
          mechanical properties of objects would be altered by rotation
          and that this would be the basis of the gravitational
          interaction. A series of experiments has been carried out
          supporting this basis of action. The report of some of these
          experiments has been appended to this theoretical
          dissertation. The results will be presented here.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) Experimental evidence
          supports the fact that a rapidly rotating material object will
          gain in inertia.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) The form of the
          gravitational interaction is that the additional inertia
          property, od, of rapidly rotating real material objects,
          represents an additional repository for the extraction and
          supplying of work from or to a gravitational field. This means
          a rotating mass will fall more rapidly (with greater
          acceleration) than a corresponding no-rotating object under
          the influence of a gravitational field.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Form of the Gravitational
            Interaction</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The complete description of
          physical phenomena depends on the result of many experiments.
          Together with the behavior of the spinning ball experiments,
          there is another series&nbsp; -- force machine pendulum
          experiments -- which have been reported elsewhere. Basically
          the phenomena reported here are summarized by these results:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) A force machine pendulum,
          i.e., a pendulum composed of two identical flywheels
          contra-rotating, for the cancellation of gyroscopic forces,
          swings with a period slightly increased over that of the
          non-energized force machine. This indicates a net increase in
          the inertia of the rotating system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) The swinging of the
          energized pendulum is non-sinusoidal, with a foreshortening
          (flattening) of the peaks of the swings.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">3) Mechanical energy of
          motion, stored in the created inertial property, od, appears
          as an inertial field. This inertial field has the property of
          conferring inertia on surrounding material objects -- and a
          reduction in the frequency of oscillating electrical circuits
          placed in the vicinity of the energized machine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When we examine the behavior
          of the spinning ball in relation to the above phenomena we can
          extract the following behavior.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the spinning ball is
          thrown upwards it leaves the cup wit some vertical velocity v,
          In order to attain this velocity the spinning ball had been
          accelerated vertically prior to the time of leaving the cup.
          Acceleration of a rotating material object requires greater
          energy than a corresponding non-rotating one since some energy
          is supplied to the od field. When the spinning object leaves
          the cup, the kinetic energy of motion is divided between the
          1/2mv2 of the "real" mass of the object, and the energy stored
          in the created inertial property, od. The sum of these two
          energies allows to attainment of a greater height reached, in
          the doing of work against the gravitational field, in
          comparison to a non-spinning object moving with the same
          initial vertical velocity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When we examine the behavior
          of the falling non-spinning object versus the spinning object,
          we notice the spinning object falling faster (with greater
          acceleration).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We infer that the behavior
          of the falling non-spinning object, falling in accord with
          Newton’s Laws, is a special case of the motion of objects in
          general. The more general case, involving rotation, is
          obscured by the gravitational interaction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We would expect, if we could
          increase the inertia of an object (through rotation of by some
          other means), that the object would fall more slowly in a
          gravitational field. Let us consider however that while a
          conferred inertial property, od, would reduce the acceleration
          of a given body acted on by a given force in outer space, in
          the presence of a gravitational field, the conferred inertial
          property would be an additional mechanical "dimension" for the
          extraction of energy from the gravitational field in falling.
          Conversely, enough energy could be delivered from this
          "dimension" to cancel, or overcome, the mechanical energy
          extracted from an object raised in a gravitational field.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On this basis we may write:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the spinning
          ball:&nbsp;&nbsp; mgh = ½ mov2 + Kodv</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the spinning ball
          falling:&nbsp;&nbsp; ½ mov2 = ½ mov2 + Kodv</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a strict sense, the
          precise application of Newton’s Laws would have to be
          restricted to non-rotating mechanical objects in field-free
          space. In a gravitational field, the possibility of extraction
          of greater energy by a new mechanical dimension opens the
          possibility of an anti-gravitational interaction. In a
          rotating force machine, od energy can be supplied:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Driven force
          machine:&nbsp;&nbsp; mgh = ½ mov2 + Kodw2</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where, w is the angular
          velocity of the force machine drive axis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Here is the possibility of
          the conversion of rotational energy to work done against the
          gravitational field. What is not determined at this point is
          the necessary increment of energy required to neutralize the
          weight of a given object, viz., it might take 1.1 foot pounds
          of work to lift a one pound object one foot. The incremental
          field necessary to establish neutral weight, or the hovering
          condition, represents the inefficiency or lack of perfection
          of a real force machine. The important fact is the
          establishment of the od field as the mechanism for a
          mechanical interaction with the gravitational field, in
          addition to the mechanical interaction expressed as Newton’s
          Laws of the falling non-spinning mechanical body.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Interpretation of
            Physical Laws</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fact that Newton’s Laws
          do not distinguish between the spinning and the non-rotating
          object represents the state of mechanical knowledge at the
          time. But because Newton did not distinguish between rotation
          and non-rotation, Einstein did not distinguish between the
          so-called inert and "gravitational mass". The fact that
          rotation affects the mechanical properties of objects paces
          Newton’s Laws as a special case and invalidates a geometrical
          interpretation of space.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many questions have been
          asked about the nature of the gravitational-rotational
          interaction and its theoretical prediction. Basically the
          theory can be looked at in the following way. If we consider a
          force, such as that engendered by the action of the
          gravitational field on a non-rotating real object, we find we
          can make a measurement of that force on what we know as a
          scale. If we examine the reading on that scale, say one pound,
          we can conduct our examinations to that degree of accuracy
          where we can reach uncertainty, i.e., 1.000000000??? It is not
          clear at that point whether the uncertainties in the
          measurement are due to properties of the experiment, or that
          which is being experimented upon. The level of causes and
          effects, uncertainty.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we consider the results
          of any experiment we find this phenomenon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If a real material object is
          rotated, it is found that within the body of the object are
          manifested the centripetal forces of rotation. If we consider
          a measurement of these forces we could find the same defect,
          that is, the measurement could be made precise enough to reach
          the noise level, i.e., causes and effects, and it would not be
          discernable whether the fluctuations were being caused by the
          experimenter or that which is being experimented upon. This
          level is the level of defect of forces and represents the
          connection between rotation and gravitation. Once there is
          established a connection, the transfer of energy follows a
          controllable orientation, viz: the spinning balls falls more
          rapidly because such an object can extract more energy from a
          gravitational interaction than can a normal one, and as well,
          the storage of energy in a force machine as an od field
          results in direct application of this energy to do work
          against the gravitational field and provide lifting force.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The concept of defect (of a
          field or force) was originally elicited epistemologically,
          forming the basis of the author’s theory of Simularity, a
          theory of Reality based on the properties of measurement.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What is considered is the
          real properties of the level of causes and effects. What this
          represents physically as a form of inertia and a connection
          between rotation and gravitation. The "connectivity" of defect
          and the other real properties of inertia fields is better left
          to discussions to begin with the data presented herein. The
          theory s more properly left to the serious students of these
          ideas. As apprehension of the theory of Simularity necessarily
          entails the dropping of certain restrictions on the mind of
          the experimenter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What can be said is this:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the further refinement of
          the art of physical conceptions, there are certain points
          reached, wherein it is in the proper ordering of things to
          drop certain concepts when they have reached the end of the
          usefulness. In the search for the gravitational interaction,
          we have long been hampered by the erroneous equation of inert
          and gravitational masses. We could better say: force is an
          element in the performance of two separate experiments -- the
          force of gravitational attraction of a test mass, and, the
          force necessary to cause a test mass to accelerate at the same
          rate at which it falls.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now that we have
          distinguished between the inert and gravitational mass by
          means of rotation, there are two principles involved:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">1) The connection between
          all experiments through the mechanism of defect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">2) The resolution or
          distinction of experiments, one from another, on the basis of
          differing procedures. There is no basis to believe that two
          experiments involving a common element (ingredient) have any
          basis to be comparable in their results, viz., the particle
          and wave hypothesis of light. It is also reasonable to suggest
          that we not apply mundane concepts of "size", "weight",
          "mass", "spin, "sign", etc., without precise explicit
          reference to the experiment being performed. Since many of the
          ideas we have about "matter" are conditioned by the models we
          construct, we may have reached a point of development where
          the "model" as a concept may have to be discarded.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is not inconceivable to
          this author, to regard physics as a collection of experiments,
          some of which may involve one or more common elements. No one
          experiment ever gives the results of another separate and
          distinct experiment. Thusly stated:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A different experiment gives
          a different result.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We can see that to take the
          common element of two distinct experiments, that is to take
          force, and then take the results of the experiments and then
          equate -- having found them "equivalent" -- such a dilemma can
          only resolve itself in a curvature of geometrical
          representation of space. In final analysis, the invariance of
          physical laws is replaced as a concept by defect, a real
          property elicited by the spinning ball experiments, and which
          now replaces the invariance of physical laws as the unifying
          concept of all experiments.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The beginning of this
          author’s work with rotating objects began with moment of
          inertia measurements of constrained gyroscopes undergoing
          forced precession. The increased moments of inertia discovered
          for precessional motion were translated into a series of
          measurements on pendulums with rotating bobs. Although the
          discovery of the inertial effects associated with precession
          and pendulum oscillations were highly suggestive, this author
          greatly resisted attempts to force him to drop a rotating
          object for two reasons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Firstly, he had no reason to
          be able to predict the motion of a freely falling object on
          the basis of the inertial alterations he had measured which
          had concerned themselves with constrained situations of
          rotating objects. Second, there was no reason to expect
          inertial alteration to affect the rate of fall of a released
          object, and there was no available theory which could in any
          way be applied to the situation of a falling object in a
          gravitational field. This is a situation known in religious
          terms as a "leap into the dark".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the author and his
          assistants are experts ion the application of stroboscopic
          lighting techniques to the study of high speed motions, the
          first experimental cut at the situation was to photograph the
          trajectories of a steel ball bearing rotating at high speed
          together with an identical control object moving at similar
          initial velocity. The result of the experiment was so
          startling and anomalous as to have taken me 5 years to
          understand.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The original results of our
          experiments were circulated as a report in 1974 (Ref. 1). Two
          years later, the experiment was published in an appendix to a
          book of Christian exegesis (Ref. 2). In 1977, one of my former
          students performed a high precision verification of the
          dropping of a rotating object: "The Gyro Drop Experiment"
          (Ref. 3). Actually, the experiment has two parts, the spinning
          ball going up, and the spinning ball falling. Since I would
          rather be thought a fool than misrepresent results of
          experiments, I only attempted to analyze the portion of the
          experiment I thought I understood. Basically, the spinning
          object going higher than the identical non-rotating control
          with the same initial velocity, and then falling faster than
          the identical non-rotating control, presents a dilemma which
          can only be resolved or understood on the basis of radically
          new concepts in physics -- concepts so radical that only the
          heretofore un-understood results of other experiments (the
          elastic collision of a rotating and an identical non-rotating
          object, et al.) and new conceptions of physics growing out of
          the many discussions and correspondence pertaining to
          rotation, inertia, gravity, and motion in general. We should
          remember the pioneers in this field: Wolfe, Cox, Dean,
          Laithwaite, Rendle, Searl, Kummel, DePalma and Delvers, to
          name but a few.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the beginning, I
          developed the concept of variable inertia to explain the
          behavior of rotating material objects, but variable inertia in
          itself contravenes the laws of physics in the sense of
          contravention of the laws of conservation of mass and energy.
          Of course, the destruction of one thing is interesting, but of
          course this is in itself not a creative act and does not take
          us any closer to the truth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because man is so interested
          in the universe, and the motions of the universe depend so
          much on gravity, the study of gravity takes us to the deepest
          foundations of human thought. I think it is a mind-bending
          experience to see every stone fall at the exact same rate as
          any other stone. And when you spin an object, why does it fall
          faster? And most mind-boggling of all, why does it go higher
          than the identical non-rotating control released to go upward
          at the same initial velocity? Of course, the experiment could
          be wrong, but also perhaps we could develop a hypothesis which
          would fit all experiments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We know that when we can
          alter the properties of mechanical objects, i.e., change their
          inertia, we have contravened the conservation of energy
          because we have associated the properties of an object with
          the space which contains the object. The space which contains
          the object also contains energy and we can go at the project
          in two ways: we can attempt to extract the energy without
          worrying where it came from, or we can attempt to understand
          physics, ourselves, and the universe by a new formulation of
          reality.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Par of the difficulty of
          accepting free energy is the feeling that we’re getting
          something for free, and that automatically makes it suspect.
          On the other hand, however, we can accept what we know as
          "energy" as something which is a natural part of our
          environment and can be reached if we have the key.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Most of the difficulties in
          the location of this energy lie in the comprehension of where
          it’s coming from. If this can be comprehended, then the
          understanding of the free energy experiment can be believed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When reality came into
          existence, the time energy of the Universe was concentrated
          into a single form, the exactitude with which a single atom
          gave off a beat of frequency when excited as a spectral line.
          We have come to regard this as the only way of measuring time.
          The true way of measuring time is in the inertia of objects.
          Thus, a tuning fork watch or oscillator is a more natural way
          of measuring which can only exist and not be measured. In the
          case of Time, we can know the existence of it, but for
          whatever measurement we take to be indicating it, we make our
          own determinations as to whether this measurement is more
          suitable or "accurate" for our purposes (we might prefer a
          crystal clock to a tuning fork, but for what purposes or
          measuring is this "time" being used?). If, for instance, we
          were interested in inertial processes, i.e., the motion and
          the orbits of the planets, and we knew these were sensitive to
          inertial influences, we might consider a "time" which was also
          sensitive to these inertial influences to be more "accurate"
          than a time derived from another experiment which might have
          no relationship to the phenomena of importance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Time is a manifestation of a
          much deeper and basic force that we have a concern for here.
          The point of connection I want to make is: the inertia of
          objects relates to the time energy flowing through them.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rotational quanta drawn
          to a rotating body induce in that body a feeling of inertial
          anisotropy as well as increased inertial mass. Could this
          "mass" be thus somehow translated into energy for mass
          consumption? The first indications of that came when we
          dropped our spinning ball experiment, but we were unwilling to
          interpret the increase in energy of a spinning to a
          non-spinning object dropped to fall over a controlled distance
          to some kind of energy principle we did not understand.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We also had a second series
          of experiments, elastic collisions of rotating and
          non-rotating identical controls which we could not interpret.
          It took a paper, "The Cause of Gravitation", by Bernard Rendle
          (Ref. 4) to jar my mind into comprehension of the facts as I
          saw them. We can only conceive of the inertia of objects, or
          inertial mass to be exact, to be representative of the time
          energy created when the Universe was created. Naturally the
          question of how old is the Universe becomes invalid then
          because a possible interpretation is that the Universe existed
          forever because inertial mass exists at all. Measurements of
          the age of the Universe are also invalid. All the time in the
          world is summed up in the inertial mass of an object.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How this relates to the
          spinning ball experiment is that the spinning of an object
          draws to it the quanta of inertial motion of rotation which
          are accumulated in the body of the flywheel and account for
          the altered inertial properties of the rotating object. These
          inertial quanta, Ro, draw the time energy to themselves in
          proportion to the number of them present in the flywheel at a
          given time. If a rotating object is collided with an identical
          non-rotating one, the non-rotating object is rebounded a
          greater distance than it would have traveled if it had been
          struck with the same identical object non-rotating. A rotating
          object struck by an identical non-rotating object rebounds
          less than it would had it not been rotating (Ref. 5).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This explains why the
          spinning ball went higher than the identical non-rotating
          control (moving at the same initial velocity), and also
          explains why the spinning object falls faster than the
          non-rotating control. The momentous fact is that there is no
          special interaction between rotation and gravity. The behavior
          of rotating objects is explained simply by the addition of
          free energy to whatever motion the rotating object is making.
          The spinning object goes higher and falls faster than the
          identical non-rotating control.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I like the understanding of
          inertia growing out of the statement of Rendle: "The
          immaterial medium of space itself is in motion" If we dispose
          of any special connection between rotation and gravity, the
          constancy of "G" then becomes the inertia of objects. The fact
          that all objects fall at the same rate (earth normal
          acceleration) means that the substrate space is moving all
          objects along at the same rate. This we can define as Earth
          normal standard inertia, a unity factor to which all other
          conditions are compared. Thus rotating an object does not
          change its inertia (under the new standard) since the
          mechanical alterations in behavior of rotating object do not
          affect their inertia but are the result of the additional
          (free) time energy flowing through the rotating object by
          virtue of its accumulation of rotational quanta, Ro.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The question to be answered:
          is there any gravitational effect from rotation, or is
          gravitation a special interaction of mass with its
          environment? I would tend to believe gravitation is a special
          interaction of real mass with its environment. This is not to
          say that artificial gravitation fields cannot be created, but
          they would always be distinguishable from the real thing
          through some physical test. An artificial gravitational field
          would be non-isotropic and anisotropic.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In terms of the dropping of
          the spinning ball, the understanding of the experiment
          involves the results of many other experiments as well as the
          resolution of a mind picture of the Universe which is our best
          approximation to understanding at the present time. What makes
          it difficult for other experimenters to understand the
          experiment is that it is not simply the results which are
          important. Without a theoretical foundation of understanding
          to make the experiment comprehensible -- to fit the results
          into a context of rational understanding and harmony with the
          facts of other experiments -- the data become trivial and
          worthless and, worst of all, subject to misinterpretation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The availability of free
          energy from as simple an experiment as colliding in a rotating
          object with a no-rotating one opens up the development of
          other machines for energy extraction and propulsion which may
          be more convenient to handle than the extraction of energy
          from the collision of a rotating object with a non-rotating
          one.</font> </p>
