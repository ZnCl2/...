      Dear Jerry Decker,<br>
      <br>
      Depalma was a true researcher who was very honest with his
      N-Generator invention.<br>
      <br>
      He wrote to me first in Nov. 1978 giving details of his
      experiment. I was stunned to note that when a small&nbsp;
      conducting&nbsp; disc magnet is rotated around its axis it did
      produce EMF between the axis and the magnet periphery, just as
      Depalma had claimed. Also, more astonishing was some reduction in
      reaction on the driving motor due to radial flow of the current
      from the axis to the periphery and its interaction with the
      magnetic field in the magnet. For instance if W watts are drawn
      from this device by connecting the static brushes at the periphery
      and the axis, the increase in the motor input was less than W. It
      could be 10 to 15 % less.<br>
      <br>
      I had been formulating a new theory (Space Vortex Theory ) on
      electron vortex structure (spare time research) that led me to a
      new behavior of electric current, that is, a colinear elements of
      electric current are attractive, not repulsive as wrongly
      believed. [Late Dr. Marinov too had reached to this conclusion.]
      Analyzing with this concept I wrote to Depalma that power from
      such devices will not be fully free, and yet incremental
      efficiency could be around 130 %. It is to be noted that if at
      some speed&nbsp; a generator shows 130%&nbsp; incremental
      efficiency, when taken to higher speed the output will exceed
      100%.<br>
      <br>
      Depalma and myself (and on one occasion Trombly too) had prolonged
      discussions through letters and personal meetings in International
      Conferences (USA, Italy ). I had pointed out to him&nbsp; that my
      system of N Generator ( later I changed to Space Power Generator,
      because electron structure is a space vortex in SVT) was to attack
      armature reaction ( due to lenz's law). In this circuit all
      experiments done by me (since1985 and continuing )&nbsp; on DC and
      later on AC generator have stator as well as roto , far different
      from the Trombly and&nbsp; DePalma&nbsp; systems.<br>
      <br>
      Depalma took a patent and, as he told me, was based on one of my
      articles published in Borderland Journal . An engineer who
      independently analyzed results from Depalma's experiment based on
      this patent sent me his result that showed 140% incremental
      efficiency. I fully agreed to that.<br>
      <br>
      Depalma was a genius who envisioned tapping power from space and
      did point clearly a system towards this possibility. Though the
      system he tried was yet to be developed, after 28 years of my own
      active research (first as spare time and later full time) I
      believe we are not far away from success. But who initiated this
      research in a new field?&nbsp; It was my true and loving friend ,
      Bruce Depalma. May his soul rest in peace!<br>
      <br>
      Best wishes,<br>
      <br>

        <b>A HOMOPOLAR GENERATOR</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Inventor: DEPALMA BRUCE [NZ] &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Applicant: HIGHVIEW DEV LTD [AU] // DEPALMA BRUCE [NZ]
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      A single piece homopolar generator (1) for use alone or in
      combination with a like or known generators comprising: current
      collectors co-operating with a rotor body (2) wherein the rotor
      body (2) comprises: at least one electrically conductive member
      (3), a central zone (14) between the zones (18, 19), at least two
      actually aligned magnets (12, 13), arranged so that the poles (20,
      21) of the magnets (12, 13) oppose to produce flux lines which
      pass through and exit the central zone (14) of said rotor body (2)
      in a direction radial to the axis of rotation; wherein the magnets
      (12, 13) in polar opposition rotate with the conductive member or
      members and wherein the north/south polar alignment of each magnet
      (12, 13) is axial; and electrical contacts proximate each end zone
      and an electrical path or paths proximate the radial extremities
      of the rotor between each contact (32, 33) formed by said
      electrically conductive member (3) or members.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an electric generator. The
      generator described herein is referred to as a quadrapole
      generator because of the four distinct magnetic poles involved in
      the machine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRIOR ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1831 Michael Faraday performed the initial experiments which
      resulted in the discovery of the dynamo. In one of his experiments
      a copper disc was secured to a cylindrical magnet with paper
      intervening the two. The poles of the magnet were aligned along
      the axis of the copper disc. Wires of a galvanometer brushed the
      centre and circumference of the copper disc respectively. It was
      discovered that upon rotation of the copper disc and magnet, an
      electrical potential was created between the terminals of the
      galvanometer. This simple construction is known as a homopolar
      generator. Importantly, this experiment revealed that a potential
      difference was created across the copper disc when it was rotated
      through a magnetic field, irrespective of whether the magnet was
      rotated with the copper disc or remained stationary.<br>
      <br>
      Another early generator was the two piece design by Faraday where
      a conducting disc is revolved adjacent to the poles of fixed
      magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Homopolar generators produce low voltages at high currents. In the
      later 1800's these unipolar generators were used in metal
      reduction and plating applications where high currents are
      required. In the early 1900's however, the development of
      commutated DC and AC generators which could develop higher
      voltages at lower operating speeds led to the decline in use of
      homopolar generators, except for specialised applications.<br>
      <br>
      Another prior art generator involves the combination of two one
      piece homopolar generators similar to that designed by Michael
      Faraday in 1831 and mounted in common on a central supporting
      conducting shaft. This generator was constructed with magnet poles
      aligned in opposition so that they were voltage additive between
      two current collector rings encircling the centers of the tandem
      rotating magnets. The current generated by this generator flows
      radially inward in a conducting disc located centrally within and
      co-axially disposed within one magnet through the connecting axle
      and then radially outward in a disc co-axially disposed within the
      second magnet. The mechanism of voltage generation in this
      generator was similar to that in the previously described one
      piece Faraday homopolar generator wherein the magnetic flux lines
      within the magnets are perpendicular to the conducting disc
      co-rotating with and centrally disposed within each permanent
      magnet assembly.<br>
      <br>
      One disadvantage of this generator is that the current output is
      limited by the diameter of the supporting axle. If the axle is
      larger, it is necessary to have larger holes in the magnets
      through which reverse flux may pass. The necessity for the hole
      through the magnets and the reverse flux problem reduces magnet
      strength and voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The copper discs of this generator were subdivided into two
      spirals to produce a self magnetising effect with current
      withdrawal which counteracted partially the high internal
      resistance of the long current path through the two copper spirals
      and the axle. The 50mm diameter shaft limited current output to
      four kilo amperes. Above this current level excessive heating
      would occur.<br>
      <br>
      Another disadvantage of this prior art generator is that the
      dumb-bell shaped rotor lacks rigidity compared with the rotor of
      the present invention to be described below. This affects ease of
      balancing the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to the present invention there is provided a single
      piece homopolar generator which has one moving part, the rotor and
      in which the desired electrical potential is produced without the
      mutual interaction of a second member (stator). This generator
      includes an electrically conductive member such as a cylindrical
      tube having two magnets therein which, when the generator is in
      operation, rotate with the tube. The cylindrical version of this
      generator, known as a Quadrapole, is not an immediately apparent
      development of the original Faraday 'one-piece' axially rotated
      magnet experiment since the vector directions of the (radial)
      magnetic flux lines and axially flowing electrical current are
      interchanged in their respective directions in comparison to the
      previously described Faraday Disc experiment.<br>
      <br>
      The one-piece, rotor only version of what is presently known as a
      cylindrical homopolar generator has not hitherto previously been
      known.<br>
      <br>
      Throughout the specification the term 'homopolar' can be taken to
      mean the repulsion of like magnetic fields, i.e. N-N or S-S which
      can alter the direction of magnetic flux lines and produce a
      radial pattern in the central zone of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      Within the last ten years certain materials such as rare earth,
      Neodymium-Iron-Boron (Nd2 Fe14 B), and Samarium-Cobalt (SaCo)
      permanent magnets, and Niobium-Tin or Niobium-Titanium
      superconductive magnet wire have become available. With these
      materials it becomes practical to fabricate magnetic structures
      impossible to realise with iron and copper wire. The configuration
      of the present invention exploits the advantages that modern
      magnetic materials provide.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved
      generator or to at least provide the public with a useful choice.<br>
      <br>
      In one broad form of the invention there is provided an electric
      generator comprising: a single piece homopolar generator for use
      alone or in combination with like or known generators comprising:
      current collectors co-operating with a rotor body wherein the
      rotor body comprises; at least one electrically conductive member,
      a central zone between end zones, at least two axially aligned
      magnets, arranged so that like poles of the magnets oppose to
      produce flux lines which pass through and exit the central zone of
      said rotor body in a direction radial to the axis of rotation;
      wherein the magnets in polar opposition rotate with the conductive
      member or members and wherein the north/south polar alignment of
      each magnet is axial; and electrical contacts proximate each end
      zone and an electrical path or paths proximate the radial
      extremities of the rotor and between each contact formed by said
      electrically conductive member or members.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably there is one electrically conductive member comprising
      a cylindrical tube and the magnets are permanent magnets which are
      permanently fixed with respect to the tube. The poles of the
      magnets are preferably orientated co-axially with the axis of the
      tube and the tube is preferably rotated at high speed.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the performance characteristics of the generator
      may be achieved by use of alternative structural arrangements
      which receive and retain the magnets and other rotor components.
      For example, it would be possible to use an array of radially
      disposed conductors such as rods providing electrical paths
      connecting electrical contacts on the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the generator may comprise concentric cylinders or
      a nest of cylindrical tubes whose axes are parallel.<br>
      <br>
      According to another embodiment there is provided an electric
      generator as hereinbefore described including an electrically
      conductive compensation tube provided about said central zone and
      spaced apart therefrom, an end of said compensation tube being
      electrically connected to the contact adjacent thereto, the other
      end of said compensation tube being electrically connected to a
      generator output terminal.<br>
      <br>
      The advantages of the homopolar generator according to the present
      invention include the following: a solid magnet across the full
      internal diameter of the tube providing higher and uniform
      magnetic field and the elimination of current flow through the
      magnet and an increased current carrying capacity now only limited
      by the size of the current collectors.<br>
      <br>
      In another broad form the present invention comprises; a rotor for
      use with a generator as hereinbefore described, the rotor
      comprising; a rotor body comprising; at least one electrically
      conductive member, a central zone between end zones, at least two
      axially aligned magnets arranged so that like poles of the magnets
      oppose to produce flux lines which when the.rotor is in use pass
      through and exit the central zone of said rotor body in a
      direction radial to the axis of rotation; wherein the magnets in
      polar opposition rotate with the conductive member or members and
      wherein the north/south polar in alignment of each magnet is
      axial; and electrical contacts proximate each end zone and an
      electrical path or paths proximate the radial extremities of the
      rotor between each contact formed by said electrically conductive
      member or members.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative form, the invention comprises; a current
      collector for use with a generator as hereinbefore described, the
      current collector comprising;<br>
      <br>
      a two part body one of which parts is detachably attached to the
      other part, wherein when the two parts are attached, a central
      bore is formed which receives a rotor, means located at least
      partially within said bore for creating a seal between the rotor
      and the outside of the bore, wherein said means forms a
      circumferential recess within the bore in which an electrically
      conductive material is located and which is in electrical contact
      with electrical contacts on a rotor in the generator, wherein, the
      space between the base of the recess and the electrical contacts
      of rotor is filled with liquid metal or eutectics providing an
      electrical path between the rotor and the current collector.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the electrical contacts are machined into the rotor and
      comprise a circumferential ring on each end zone, providing an
      electrical connection between the surface of the cylindrical tube
      and the conductive liquid metal or eutectics.<br>
      <br>
      In a further form according to the system aspect the present
      invention comprises: a system for generating electricity using a
      single piece homopolar generator; the system comprising; the
      single piece generator, having one moving part, the rotor, and in
      which the desired electrical potential is produced without mutual
      interaction of a stator, a power source to drive the generator, a
      field of energy influence within which the generator is situated
      and with which the generator interacts, wherein the interaction
      between the generator and the field influences the output of the
      generator by supplementing energy input to the generator from said
      power source.<br>
      <br>
      A rotor may be constructed of multiple concentric conducting
      cylinders. In the zone of zero or low magnetic flux pertaining to
      the region encircling the centers of rare-earth magnets or
      super-conducting solenoids, multiple sliding liquid metal contacts
      may be established thus enabling a series connection of the
      portions of the concentric conducting cylinders in the voltage
      generating region between the opposing poles of the rotating
      magnets contained within the nested cylinders. Voltage addition by
      connecting a series of concentric conducting cylinders in a
      one-piece cylindrical homopolar generator has not previously been
      known.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the existence of a region of zero radial magnetic field
      in a zone encircling the center of a cylindrical permanent magnet,
      i.e. the neutral zone, current extraction from the rotating member
      is taken at this point. Current extraction by means of a liquid
      metal sliding contact in this zone eliminates any electro-magnetic
      forces which might act to disturb the liquid metal contact during
      current extraction. A zone of zero magnetic flux also eliminates
      electrical currents circulating transversely through the
      conductive body of a current collector because of inhomogeneities
      in voltage across the width of the liquid metal sliding contact.<br>
      <br>
      With the Quadrapole, the magnets are arranged NSSN or SNNS and the
      fact that the magnetic flux lines emerge radially from the center
      of the conducting cylinder is because of the mutual repulsion of
      opposing directions of like (homopolar) force.<br>
      <br>
      In the conventional two-piece cylindrical homopolar machine,
      magnetic flux lines are caused to emerge radially from the central
      voltage generation segment of the cylindrical rotating member by
      fixed iron pole pieces which encircle the rotating cylinder and
      form part of a stator structure which closes the magnetic flux
      paths in fixed external loops back to each axle of the machine.
      The two piece closed path construction makes no use of the
      mutually repulsive effect of homopolar magnetic fields because in
      the closed path construction the magnetic field internal to the
      cylinder is directed to flow radially outward by low magnetic
      reluctance external pole pieces.<br>
      <br>
      Without the provision of external pole pieces and a closed
      magnetic flux path, the attainable magnetic field strength within
      such a machine would be so low as to render the machine not
      suitable for commercial application. Rare earth high strength
      permanent magnets make it possible to obtain high strength and
      useful radially directed magnetic flux lines without closed
      magnetic flux paths. The radially directed flux arises from mutual
      repulsion of homopolar flux fields.<br>
      <br>
      The key requirements of the cylindrical one-piece homopolar
      generator as herein described are that all parts of the rotor
      including the magnets must rotate together and there is no closure
      of the magnetic flux paths by fixed ferromagnetic yokes, -
      stators.<br>
      <br>
      If the permanent rare-earth magnets are replaced with
      super-conducting electrical solenoidal coils, the coils must
      rotate with the cylinder. The magnetic fields produced when they
      are cooled and energised must be poled NSSN or SNNS and the
      spacing of the coils adjusted to produce radial flux lines
      perpendicular to the central voltage producing segment, (of the
      rotating conductive cylinder enclosing and supporting the magnet
      solenoids). The mutual repulsion of homopolar flux fields is
      employed to create radially diverging flux lines in the central
      zone.<br>
      <br>

      Referring now to figure 1 there is shown a sectional view of a
      rotor 2 for use with a generator 1 (see figure 2) according to a
      preferred embodiment of the invention. Rotor 2 comprises an
      electrically conductive cylindrical tube 3 which may include end
      plates 4 and 5.<br>
      <br>
      End plates 4 and 5 each preferably comprise an aluminium disc.
      Fixed to the ends of cylindrical tube 3 and covering plates 4 and
      5 respectively are non magnetic stainless steel end caps 6 and 7.
      End caps 6 and 7 terminate in shaft ends 8a and 8b respectively.
      End caps 6 and 7 are preferably affixed to the cylindrical tube 3
      by means of screw threads 6a and 7a located on end caps 6 and 7
      respectively. Alternatively, end caps 6 and 7 may be fixed via an
      internal thread (not shown) on inner surface 3 a of cylindrical
      housing 3 or fixed with a glue or friction fitted. The
      electrically conductive tube 3 of rotor 2 may comprise as an
      alternative hollow members such as but not limited to a sphere or
      cube. Shaft ends 8a and 8b may be integral with or are detachably
      connected to end caps 6 and 7 and are co-axial with cylindrical
      tube 3. Rotor shaft ends 8a and 8b are, when in situ, surrounded
      by bearing assemblies 9a and 9b (see figure 2) respectively
      allowing free rotation of the cylindrical tube 3 upon rotation of
      rotor shaft 8. Once bearings 9a and 9b (see figure 2) are fitted
      to the rotor shaft ends 8a and 8b, the bearings are contained
      within stationary supports 10 and 11 (see figure 2). Cylindrical
      tube 3 rotates freely about its axis when driven via shaft ends 8a
      or 8b. Fixed to cylindrical tube 3 are permanent magnets 12 and 13
      which rotate with the cylindrical tube 3 when the generator
      operates.<br>
      <br>
      The magnets are oriented so that their like poles oppose (in this
      case the north poles) resulting in magnetic flux lines being
      directed radially outwardly from central zone 14 of cylindrical
      tube 3. Throughout the specification the term 'central zone' can
      be taken to mean that region in the centre of the rotor wherein
      the output voltage is generated when the rotor is rotated. A
      cavity 15 is formed between two shaped cast iron pole pieces 20
      and 21 between magnets 12 and 13.<br>
      <br>
      As well as having a central zone 14, cylindrical tube 3 includes
      end zones 18 and 19 wherein the central zone 14 is disposed
      between the end zones.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to figure 2 there is shown an exploded view of the
      generator of figure 1 including the rotor 2 of figure 1, current
      collectors 22 and 23 and their interrelationship with the
      cylindrical tube 3.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 also shows connected to electrically conductive
      cylindrical tube 3 end caps 6 and 7 terminating in rotor shaft
      ends 8a and 8b respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Current collectors 22 and 23 both of which are identical are
      located at contacts 32 and 33 in end zones 18 and 19 respectively
      of cylindrical tube 3. Each collector is located along cylindrical
      tube 3 in a neutral region of each end zone in a flux field where
      the concentration of flux is low. As current collectors 22 and 23
      are identical, only current collector 22 will be described in
      detail and with reference to figure 3 below to avoid duplication.<br>
      <br>
      As the rotor of the generator 1 is rotated, a voltage potential
      develops between contacts 32 and 33. Power output is drawn from
      the generator via the two current collectors 22 and 23.<br>
      <br>
      The mercury provides the electrical contact between the
      cylindrical tube 3 and current collectors 22 and 23 which are in
      electrical contact with output terminals 24 and 25 (see figure 8).
      It has been found that using the pole configuration shown in
      figure 1 that 3 to 4 times the voltage output of a standard
      homopolar generator may be obtained using magnets having the same
      field strength.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to figure 3 there is shown an exploded isometric
      view of a typical current collector. Figure 3 shows an enlargement
      of the current collector 22 of figure 2 comprising two parts 27
      and 28 which preferably are symmetrical about their plane of
      separation and which together form a contact body housing 26 (see
      figure 4). Body parts 27 and 28 are preferably manufactured from a
      high conductivity material eg. copper. To form current collector
      22 each of parts 27 and 28 which include semi circular bores 29a
      and 29b respectively receive substantially semi circular and
      preferably plastic sealing elements 30a, 30b, 3 0c and 3 0d which
      when in situ and mated together form circular recess 31 (see
      figure 4). In use, recess 31 receives liquid mercury which
      provides the electrical contact with contact 32 on cylindrical
      tube 3. Contact 32 rotates in circular recess 31. Body parts 27
      and 28 are mated together by means of bolts or locking screws 34
      and 35.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 shows the current collector 22 of figure 3 assembled.
      When body parts 27 and 28 are mated together a seal is created by
      plastic seal 30 formed by sealing elements 30a, 30b, 30c and 30d
      thereby preventing the escape of liquid mercury during operation
      of the generator. It will be appreciated that plastic seal 30 can
      be an integral member as an alternative to formation by separate
      elements. There is a small clearance between sealing elements 30a,
      30b, 30c, 30d and the rotor 2. Screw threads are machined on the
      sealing lands 58, 59, 60, 61 (see figure 1) ofthe cylindrical tube
      3, so that any leakage of mercury is returned when the rotor is
      rotating to recess 31 - the electrical contact zone.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative to use of liquid metal contacts, electrical
      brushes which are widely used in electrical machinery may be used.
      However, the generator, according to the present invention
      produces low voltage at very high currents which is generally
      unsuitable for solid sliding contacts. The preferred contacts are
      conducting liquid metals such as mercury or eutectics such as
      sodium-potassium or gallium-indium. The use of liquid metal
      electrical contacts gives the advantage of lower electrical
      resistance, lower mechanical friction and low wear.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical contacts 32 and 33 are machined into the cylindrical
      tube 3. Preferably a number of annular ridges 32a and 33a may be
      formed on contacts 32 and 33 respectively. Contacts 32 and 33 are
      when surrounded by current collectors 22 and 23 separated by a
      very small clearance between the conductive surface of recess 31
      (in the case of contact housing body 26). There is a corresponding
      arrangement in contact assembly 23. Preferably that clearance for
      each contact is 0.5mm or less.<br>
      <br>
      Each of current collectors 22 and 23 include capillary lines. As
      the capillary line arrangements for current collectors 22 and 23
      are the same, the following description will relate to the
      capillary line for current collector 22 shown assembled in figure
      4. Referring to figure 3 it can be seen that body part 28 of
      current collector 22 includes mercury reservoir 44 which feeds
      into capillary line 42 with flow of liquid metal into recess 31
      being controlled by means of valve 46. In use, rotor 2 is rotated
      and then liquid metal is introduced from reservoir 44 via the
      capillary line 42 to the space between the circumferential contact
      32 (see figure 1) and recess 31 of current collector 22 (see
      figure 3).<br>
      <br>
      Centrifugal forces and viscous drag cause liquid metal to be taken
      up on the contacts 32 and 33 of cylindrical tube 3 to form a
      circumferential ring of liquid metal bead encircling those
      contacts. Thus, for current collector 22 mercury is in contact
      with the surfaces within recess 31 of contact body housing 26.
      Similarly for contact assembly 23. Because the liquid metal bead
      is held in place by a combination of centrifugal and viscous
      forces the clearance between contact 32 and recess 31 can be quite
      large (for instance, 2mm). Once the cylindrical tube is rotating
      and the liquid metal has been introduced, the apparatus will
      operate equally well either horizontally or vertically. For
      satisfactory operation the liquid metal should wet the inner
      surfaces of recess 31. In the case of mercury, to a achieve proper
      amalgamation it is preferred that a process is employed to remove
      oxide from the surface of the body parts 27 and 28 prior to
      introduction of the mercury.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to figure 5 there is shown the rotor 2 of figure 1
      seated in part of current collectors 22 and 23. It can be seen
      that contacts 32 and 33 locate in recesses 31 and 37 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Recess 31 is formed by plastic seal elements 30a, 30b and recess
      37 is formed by seal elements 38a and 38b. Seal elements 30a, 30b,
      38a and 38b engage respectively sealing lands 58, 59, 60 and 61
      which have helical threads which urge any mercury that escapes
      recesses 31 and 37 back into those recesses when the rotor
      rotates.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to figure 6 there is shown a long section view of
      the rotor 2 of figure 1 showing the disposition of the flux lines
      relative to the cylindrical tube 3. Cylindrical tube 3 is shown
      including permanent magnets 12 and 13. Magnets 12 and 13 are
      preferably permanent magnets and may either be conventional
      magnets, rare earth metal magnets or super conducting magnets. The
      magnets 12 and 13 may each be formed from a plurality of magnetic
      elements or other magnetic material. As cylindrical tube 3 is
      preferably formed of a high strength, high electrical conductivity
      copper alloy the cylindrical tube can be rotated at very high
      speeds. The polar oppositition configuration of magnets 12 and 13
      produce flux lines which pass through and exit the central zone of
      cylindrical tube 3 in a direction that is perpendicular to the
      axis of the cylindrical tube 3 in central zone 14. From figure 6
      it can be seen that there is a concentration of radial flux in
      central region 14 as depicted by flux lines 39. Flux lines 40a, b,
      c and d are concentrated in end zones 18 and 19 as shown.<br>
      <br>
      Rotation of the conductive cylindrical tube 3 with the magnetic
      flux generates a potential difference between contacts 32 and 33
      (refer figure 1). The electric potential between terminals 32 and
      33 is given by the relationship<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="formula.jpg" height="117"
          width="288"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      where: E is the potential difference between the contacts 32 and
      33 in volts, <br>
      <br>
      Bn is the flux density (in Gauss) normal to the surface of
      cylindrical tube 3, i.e. acting radially to the axis of rotation
      of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      1 is the distance in cm between contacts 32 and 33; and<br>
      <br>
      v is the tangential velocity of the surface of cylindrical tube 3
      in cm/second.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, 1 will effectively be the length of cylindrical tube
      3 adjacent poles 16 and 17.<br>
      <br>
      As the potential difference is proportional to the tangential
      velocity of the cylinder it is preferable that the cylindrical
      tube 3 be built as large as possible to achieve optimal output
      voltage, and be rotated as fast as possible, for example, up to
      100,000 rpm or beyond if physical limits permit.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the high currents generated by the generator, super
      conducting materials are particularly suitable to be incorporated
      in or used with cylindrical tube 3.<br>
      <br>
      A generator of the type hereinbefore described can produce very
      high output currents (multiples of kiloamperes) at low voltages.
      The withdrawal of high electrical currents from the generator
      results in a magnetic field consisting of circular flux lines
      enclosing the central zone 14 of the cylindrical tube 3. A method
      of cancelling or at least minimising these effects will now be
      described with reference to figure 7 of the drawings.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to figure 7 there is shown a schematic representation of
      a generator similar to that depicted in figure 1 including
      magnetic compensation means. In the embodiment shown a conductive
      compensation tube 48 is positioned about and spaced apart from,
      the central zone 14 of cylindrical tube 3. One end 49 of
      compensation tube 48 is electrically connected to contact 50 by
      conductor 51. The opposite end 52 of compensation tube 48 is
      connected to outward terminal 53 of the generator by conductive
      connection 54. Compensation tube 48 remains stationary while
      cylindrical body 3 rotates relative thereto. Compensation tube 48
      produces compensatory circular magnetic flux which cancels the
      field generated by withdrawal of current. This works in the same
      manner as a coaxial cable; whereby equal currents flow in opposite
      directions thus the magnetic fields thereby produced cancel each
      other. The cancellation of the magnetic fields due to the high
      currents in the generator is important, since the field distortion
      (armature reaction) produced by these currents when uncompensated
      can limit the power output of the machine by altering the
      perpendicularity of the flux lines to the rotating cylindrical
      tube 3.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to figure 8 there is shown an isometric view of a
      fully assembled generator including output terminals 24 and 25 in
      communication with current collectors 22 and 23 with spacing block
      56 therebetween. Outside current collectors 22 and 23 are bearing
      supports 10 and 11 which receive bearings 9a and 9b (see figure
      2). Outside bearing support 11 is drive wheel 57.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 9 shows the assembled generator of figure 8 with an
      electric motor 62 connected thereto via drive belt 63 which
      engages drive wheel 57.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus seen that the present invention provides a generator
      having improved performance over known homopolar generators.
      Particularly, in this invention the arrangement of the magnets in
      polar opposition provides increased flux concentrations,
      increasing the output voltage of the generator for the same
      strength of magnet employed. The magnetic compensation method of
      the invention allows the generator to operate at high power
      outputs without substantial effect on the perpendicularity of the
      flux lines. Finally, contacts using liquid metal reduce the
      electrical and frictional losses of the generator.<br>
      <br>
      Where in the foregoing description reference has been made to
      integers or components having known equivalents then such
      equivalents are herein incorporated as if individually set forth.<br>
      <br>
      For example, it is to be appreciated that cylindrical tube 3 need
      not by cylindrical, although a cylindrical tube is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      The magnets which are the source of flux must rotate integrally
      with the cylindrical tube 3 in polar opposition with flux lines
      parallel to the axis of rotation even though the output voltag<br>
      <br>
      Although this invention has been described by way of example it is
      to be appreciated that improvements and/or modifications may be
      made thereto without departing from the scope or spirit ofthe
      invention, such as but not limited to: use of low friction
      bearings, for example air bearings; operating the device in a
      vacuum sealed environment to reduce windage drag; modifications to
      the magnetic field to enhance the performance, utility and
      regulation of the generator.<br>
