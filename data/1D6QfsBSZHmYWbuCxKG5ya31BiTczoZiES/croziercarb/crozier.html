      “Actor Scott D. Roberts and his filmmaking partner, Jeremy Wagener
      are the unlikely men behind the new documentary GasHole. Narrated
      by The O.C. and American Beauty actor Peter Gallagher, the film
      chronicles the history of oil prices and alternative fuels. It
      will screen for one night only at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the Village 8
      Theater in Louisville.<br>
      <br>
      This is its second stop in Louisville; a screening on July 14 sold
      out. The idea started 21/2 years ago when gas prices were at a
      then-high of $2.20 and a letter to the editor in The Modesto Bee
      newspaper sparked Roberts’ interest. The letter writer told of a
      Buick Roadmaster he saw come to the Crows Landing Naval Airfield
      in the 1940s that its inventor claimed was water-injected and
      could get 100 miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor said he became a millionaire by selling the patent to
      Shell Oil Co., but one of the conditions was he could not make any
      more. “His story was jaw-dropping,” Roberts said. So Roberts
      called his friend Wagener, an L.A.-based writer-director, and said
      he might have a great idea for a movie.<br>
      <br>
      The two began researching it and tracked down Kunde, who tells his
      story in the film. From there, the filmmakers went in search of
      the elusive patent sold to Shell. They found one from 1946
      registered to a man who lived 20 miles outside Modesto; they
      thought it could be the invention in question. They brought the
      design to an engineer, who agreed that it might be able to improve
      fuel economy. From there, the documentary took off.<br>
      <br>
      Kunde’s story led them to find other documented cases of
      fuel-saving inventions that never have seen the light of day. They
      include Texas inventor Tom Ogle’s 100-mpg vapor fuel system and
      Shell’s own internal 1977 publication “Fuel Economy of the
      Gasoline Engine,” which shows that Shell engineers were able to
      achieve 149.95 mpg on a 1947 Studebaker. www.gasholemovie.com<br>

      <br>
      Jan. 4, 1949. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Our invention relates to a water carburetor and has for its
      principal object, to provide simple, inexpensive and highly
      efficient means, whereby a regulated and controlled amount of
      water is inducted into air horn of a gasoline carburetor to mix
      with the air stream passing to said carburetor and from the
      latter, into the combustion chambers of an internal combustion
      engine. Particularly the invention relates to an improved device
      for introducing water into the carburetor intake air stream at
      rates in accordance with the quantities or rates of the air flow,
      for the several purposes of increasing the volumetric efliciency
      of the engine; suppressing detonation, decreasing fuel
      consumption, and increasing the power output and general
      performance efficiency of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Our major object is to accomplish these purposes by a novel
      assembly comprising a tubular or ring-like member insertible
      between the carburetor and air filter and containing a water
      induction nozzle of Venturi characteristics, and a directly
      connected body containing a float controlled water supply chamber
      from which water is delivered to the nozzle in accordance with the
      rate of air flow to the carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      Particularly contemplated is the provision of means whereby air is
      mixed with water passing to the nozzle, and specifically in a
      manner whereby the induction of air by the nozzle-created suction
      elevates the water from a normal level below the nozzle position.
      i<br>
      <br>
      A further object of our invention is, to provide a simple,
      practical and highly efficient high speed bleeder, which acts
      positively and automatically to produce a water-air mixture which,
      when combined with the main fuel and air mixture forms an ideal
      fuel for internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      Our present application is an improvement on our copending
      application on Anti-knock or detonation dampening device, filed
      March 20, 1944,-Ser. No. 527,252, now Patent No. 2,407,478.<br>
      <br>
      With the foregoing and other objects in view, our invention
      consists in certain novel features of construction and arrangement
      of parts which will be hereinafter more fully described and
      claimed and illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
      <br>
      <b>Fig. 1 is a plan view of our improved water carburetor.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Fig. 2 is a vertical section taken on the line 2-2 of Fig.
        1 and showing parts of the air cleaner and carburetor with which
        our device is combined.</b><b><br>

          width="707"><br>
        <img alt="" src="US2458256a.jpg" height="928" width="658"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Referring by numerals to the accompanying drawings which
      illustrate a preferred embodiment of our invention, Hi designates
      a ring having a lower portion suitably clamped on the inlet end of
      a conventional carburetor horn C and with its upper portion
      disposed within the lower end portion of the air cleaner outlet A.<br>
      <br>
      Formed integral with the upper portion of ring ill, on the inner
      face thereof is a lug or internal projection ll, arcuate in length
      to conform to the wall of said ring and which lug functions as a
      nozzle for the induction of water into the carburetor air intake
      stream and in accordance with its rate of flow.<br>
      <br>
      From the upper rear edge of this lug, its upper or exposed face
      curves inwardly toward the center of the ring and downwardly to a
      horizontal plane a short distance above the bottom of said lug,
      thus forming a short vertically disposed duct or channel l2 that
      is arcuate in horizontal section and convex in vertical section to
      present an air-contacted surface having in cross-section as viewed
      in Fig. 2, a Venturi section shape.<br>
      <br>
      From the horizontally disposed lower edge of this duct, the front
      face of the lug is undercut to form a horizontally arcuate
      vertically inclined face I3.<br>
      <br>
      Formed in one end of the curved face l2 of nozzle l I, at the top
      thereof, is a shallow depression H.<br>
      <br>
      Formed integral with ring I0 directly opposite the nozzle II is an
      external projection or lug 15, in which is formed a centrally
      disposed horizontal duct l6 closed at its outer end by a plug l1
      and its inner end, which is slightly smaller than its outer
      portion, terminates in a jet aperture. It on the lower portion of
      undercut face 13 just below the lower end of the channel I 2.<br>
      <br>
      Formed in lug l5, parallel with duct I6 is a duct 15, the rear end
      of which is closed by a plug 20 and the forward portion of this
      duct extends upwardly in nozzle H and terminates in an air inlet
      aperture 2| in the center of the depression H.<br>
      <br>
      A substantially rectangular housing 22 having a removable cover
      23, provides a water supply chamber and integral with one side of
      said housing is a vertically disposed housing 24 having a water
      well 25, the upper end thereof communicating through an aperture
      28, with the rear portion of duct to.<br>
      <br>
      Formed in the upper portion of one of side walls of housing 22 is
      a breather aperture 22a. Formed integral with the upper end of
      housing 24 is a flange 21, upon which-rests lug i5, and the parts
      being secured to each other by screws or bolts 28.<br>
      <br>
      Screw seated in lug i along side duct I6, is a screw plug as
      having a diametrically disposed aperture 29a, that registers with
      duct i9, and depending from said screw plug is a small tube 3|
      that depends into well 25 and its lower end being closed by a plug
      22.<br>
      <br>
      The upper end portion of tube 3| fits snugly in an aperture 38
      formed in lug I5 below plug 29 and formed through the wall of said
      tube throughout its length are several small air Jet apertures 34.<br>
      <br>
      The upper one of these apertures is disposed below the normal
      water level prevailing in the chamber within housing 22, which
      water level is indicated by dotted line WL in Figs. 2, 3 and 4 and
      ring it and housing 22 are relatively disv a, 7 in the airhorn of
      the gasoline carburetor above the butterfly thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Under normal conditions with float elevated, finger 48 bears
      against the outer end of plunger 44 and holds needle 45 against
      its seat 42 and when water is withdrawn from the float chamber,
      and the float lowers, the pressure of finger 48 against plunger 44
      is relieved and hook 44a in groove 49 acts on plunger to withdraw
      the needle valve 45 from its seat, thus permitting water to enter
      the float chamber from duct 43.<br>
      <br>
      Screw 35 is adjusted so as to control and regulate a metered flow
      of water from the float chamber into wall 25. Suction produced as
      a result of acceleration of motor speeds and increased rates of
      air flow along the nozzle surfaces l2 and I3 draws water through
      duct l6 from the top of well 25, which water discharges from the
      jet aperture to be picked up and mixed with the air posed so that
      ducts l6 and 19 are above said normal water level. Perforated tube
      31 in operation, provides a high speed bleeder for automatically
      delivering water spray to the air stream as it passes from the air
      filter to the carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      Means for controlling a metered flow of water from the chamber
      within housing 22 into the lower portion of well 25, comprises a
      screw 35 seated in the lower portion of housing 22 and provided
      with a tapered end portion 36, which enters a port 31,
      communicating with the lower end of well and arranged between the
      head of said screw and the wall in which the screw is seated is an
      expansive coil spring 38.<br>
      <br>
      The outer end of the chamber 39 occupied by screw as, is closed by
      a screw plug 40, thus preventing leakage of any water that might
      seep from the chamber in housing 22, past the threaded portion of
      said screw.<br>
      <br>
      Located in one end of housing'22 is a tubular fitting 4! having a
      seat 42 for a needle valve and connected to the outer end of said
      fitting is a water supply duct 43 which may lead from the radiator
      hose or from a small tank conveniently located beneath the engine
      hood. I<br>
      <br>
      Arranged for sliding movement in fitting 4|, is a plunger 44,
      non-circular in cross section, and the outer end of said plunger
      terminates in a needle valve 45, which cooperates with seat 42 in
      controlling the flow of water from duct 43 into the chamber within
      housing 22.<br>
      <br>
      A conventional float 46 is pivoted at 41 beneath fitting 4i, and
      extending upward from said pivot is a narrow finger 48 that bears
      against the outer end of plunger 44 and the upper end of this
      finger is bent downward to form a hook 48:; that engages in a
      groove 49 formed in the rear portion of plunger 44 (see Fig. 3-).<br>
      <br>
      Projecting upward from the bottom of housing 22, is a web 50,
      which serves as a stop to limit the downward movement of float 46.<br>
      <br>
      When the motor, with which our water carburetor is associated, is
      at idle speed no water is taken into the air stream and likewise
      while going down grades in gear, no water is taken in.<br>
      <br>
      The device injects water only when the motor picks up the load
      under partial and full throttle, a Vacuum tending within said
      passage from one side only passing to the gasoline carburetor.<br>
      <br>
      With particular reference to the displacement of water from the
      well 25 into passage i8, it will be noted, see Fig. 5, that the
      normal water level in the well and tube 3| is above the uppermost
      aperture 34, and consequently that no air flow through the
      aperture into the well occurs until the suction communicated from
      passage l8 lowers the water in the tube to the aperture depth.
      Thereupon the air stream entering the well beneath the water level
      agitates and entrains the water to a degree causing it to be
      carried by the air stream into passage It for admixture with the
      air taken into the carburetor.- And of course, lowering pressures
      communicated from passage I6 produces increasing air flow into the
      well and increasing displacement of water therefrom. As water is
      so displaced from the well and the water level therein drops,
      openings 34 progressively admit air into the well, but
      individually with decreasing air passage since each upper opening
      34 uncovered by a drop of the outside water level acts as an air
      bleeder with relation to the apertures below.<br>
      <br>
      Thus the air taken into the gasoline carburetor is heavily laden
      with moisture and the resultant vaporized mixture of air, water
      and gasoline provides an ideal gaseous fuel for the development of
      increased power, cooler engine temperatures, elimination of
      preignition and detonation, also, the superheated steam action in
      the dissolving of the carbon holding gums resulting from use of
      hydrocarbon fuels in engines.<br>
      <br>
      Among the particularly novel and advantageous features of our
      invention are, the nozzle II and the high speed bleeder 3|, which
      are arranged and constructed so as to act automatically in
      response to engine speeds and loads to provide an air water
      mixture and deliver same directly into the air stream from the air
      filter to the gasoline carburetor.<br>

      <b>Description</b><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Our invention relates generally to internal combustion engines and
      more particularly to simple and efficient means for counteracting
      and dampening detonation or engine knock and the principal object
      of our invention is to provide simple and efficient automatic
      means for introducing steam vapor to the carburetor to mix with
      the combustible gaseous mixture drawn into the cylinders.<br>
      <br>
      The steam vapor when entering the combustion chamber acts as a
      coolant during the explosion cycle and its expansion through the
      differential in temperature will act as a cushion or dampener
      respectively producing a gas of its own to further assist
      combustion, so that detonation, more familiarly known as an engine
      knock is thus eliminated.<br>
      <br>
      It may readily be seen that with a device of this kind, higher
      compression ratios can be utilized materializing more power and
      fuel economy and lower grade fuels.<br>
      <br>
      Further objects of our invention are, to provide a device of the
      character referred to, having a simple and effective steam
      generator, constructed so as to` be conveniently mounted on the
      exhaust manifold of the engine and thus be heated by the exhaust
      gases passing through said manifold and further, to provide means
      for utilizing the velocity of the air entering the carburetor for
      regulating the amount of steam to correct proportions for all
      engine speeds and throttle positions.<br>
      <br>
      With the foregoing and other objects in view, our invention
      consists in certain novel features of construction and arrangement
      of parts which will be hereinafter more fully described and
      claimed and illustrated in the accompanying drawing in which:<br>
      <b><br>

      Referring by numerals to the accompanying drawing which
      illustrates a preferred embodiment of our invention, I6 designates
      the upper portion of a conventional carburetor, I I the air filter
      associated therewith, I2 the exhaust manifold and I3 with `a
      spiral duct in its upper portion, said duct being closed by a
      cover screws 22 pass through cars on the cover plate into
      receptacle 23 a source of water supply which may be the water
      jacket of the engine or the radiator.<br>
      <br>
      Connecting the carburetor with the air filter is a collar I4 in
      the center of which is a short vertically disposed tube I5 having
      a Venturi passageway I6, said tube being connected to the wall of
      collar by a narrow web I1 through which is formed a duct I8 the
      inner end of which communicates with the center of the Venturi I6.<br>
      <br>
      The steam generator includes a metal disc I9 plate 2I. Bolts or
      the manifold, thereby securing the generator thereto.<br>
      <br>
      Thus with the cover secured on the disc, the duct 20 provides an
      elongated steam generating chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Secured to cover plate 2I and leading from the inner end of duct
      20 to the cuter end of duct I8 is a conduit 22. As a result of
      this arrangement the steam or moist vapor from the generator
      enters the carburetor at a point in advance of its main nozzle. A
      small tank. or container 23 is located below the source of water
      supply I3, and located in the bottom of said tank is a valve
      housing 24 provided in its upper end with an inlet 25 which is
      normally closed by a downwardly opening check valve 26. A stem 21
      connects valve 26 to a float 28 within tank 23.<br>
      <br>
      Leading from the source of water supply I3 to the lower portion of
      valve housing 24 is a conduit 29 in which is located a valve 30.<br>
      <br>
      Leading from the lower portion of tank 23 to the outer end of duct
      20 in the steam generator is a conduit 3|, the flow of water
      through which is controlled by a valve 32 actuated by a
      conventional thermostat 33 located on exhaust manifold I2 adjacent
      the steam generator.<br>
      <br>
      Through the action of oat actuated valve 26, a constant supply of
      water is maintained in reand under a predetermined degree of heat
      from the exhaust products of combustion passing through manifold
      I2, thermostat 33 will open valve 32, thereby permitting water to
      flow through conduit 3I into duct 20 in disc I9, which latter is
      also heated by the products of combustion passing through the
      exhaust manifold. Thus, the Water owing through the elongated duct
      in the disc I9 will be heated and nally converted into steam which
      is drawn through conduit 22, and thence through duct I8 to unite
      and mix with the air drawn through the venturi and such air enters
      the carburetor to unite with the liquid hydrocarbon to form an
      exceptionally effective and powerful gaseous fuel for the engine.<br>
      <br>
      The addition of moisture in vapor form, to the gaseous fuel drawn
      into the combustion chambers of the engine, materially increases
      the power output counteracts the formation of carbon in the
      combustion chambers and assures smooth running of said engine- The
      steam generator comprising disc I9 and cover 20 is directly
      attached to the exhaust manifold and has a relatively large
      heating area with a small water space thus insuring the rapid and
      effective generation of steam while the device is in operation.<br>
      <br>
      Float actuated valve insures a constant supply of water in
      receptacle 23, valve 32 regulates the flow of generator and
      passageway I6 regulates the amount of steam to correct proportions
      in relation to engine speeds and throttle position.<br>
      <br>
      Thus it will be seen that we have provided an anti-knock or
      detonation dampening device which is simple in structure,
      inexpensive of manufacture, exceptionally economical in point of
      fuel consumption, capable of being readily used in connection with
      practically all internal combustion engines, and said device being
      very effective in performing the function for which it is
      intended.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that minor changes in the size, form and
      construction of the various parts of our anti-knock or detonation
      dampening device may be made and substituted for those while
      thermostatic water to the steam duct.<br>
