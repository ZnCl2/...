      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      We identified a set of sound-responsive genes in plants using a
      sound-treated subtractive library and demonstrated sound
      regulation through mRNA expression analyses. Under both light and
      dark conditions, sound up-regulated expression of rbcS and ald.
      These are also light-responsive genes and these results suggest
      that sound could represent an alternative to light as a gene
      regulator. Ald mRNA expression increased significantly with
      treatment at 125 and 250Hz, whereas levels decreased significantly
      with treatment at 50Hz, indicating a frequency-specific response.
      To investigate whether the ald promoter responds to sound, we
      generated transgenic rice plants harboring a chimeric gene
      comprising a fusion of the ald promoter and GUS reporter. In three
      independent transgenic lines treated with 50 or 250Hz for 4h, GUS
      mRNA expression was up-regulated at 250Hz, but down-regulated at
      50Hz. Thus, the sound-responsive mRNA expression pattern observed
      for the ald promoter correlated closely with that of ald,
      suggesting that the 1,506bp ald promoter is sound-responsive.
      Therefore, we propose that in transgenic plants, specific
      frequencies of sound treatment could be used to regulate the
      expression of any gene fused to the ald promoter.<br>

      The present invention relates to a control method of gray mold,
      more particularly, the growth of the control method and the gray
      mold pathogen of gray mold comprising the step of treating the
      single sound wave selected from a frequency of 500 Hz 250 Hz to
      the target crop It relates to a suppression method. Gray mold
      pathogen (Botrytis cinerea) is strawberries, lettuce, cucumber,
      eggplant, etc. vegetable crops from Lilium, Gladiolus, such as
      host range to fungal infections that can cause gray mold on many
      crops ranging from flowering crops is very large, the conidia and
      by scattering it can be continued spread, it is the damage on the
      harvesting of crops by fungal pathogens that cause the bottle in a
      bar without plant pathogens overwinter in the form of host crops
      are grown year-round as today. In the case of plant pathogens, to
      play a big role in the invasion of toxins and enzymes are plants
      that pathogens are produced, intrusion mechanism of gray mold
      germs that decompose the cuticle layer of the first gateway to
      pathogen invasion with such black byeolmunui bottle of cucumber
      better cuticle enzyme to generate the decomposition by the
      cuticles are known to invade the plant. And the gray mold disease
      is endemic ripe fruit or fruit faucets, leaves, etc. petiole,
      because so rot turned the fruit into dark brown also are falling
      cause commodity as value and becomes diseased fruits of the
      harvest is discarded as a gray mold in a commercial farm due to
      yield losses it should also pass 50% of the yield. Also, because
      they cause damage during transport during or sell their damages
      are thought to be much more than the estimate. Therefore, many
      pesticides for controlling the gray mold are now being marketed.
      However, the pesticide in the greenhouse during the winter, rather
      than the infection can result in more in some cases when a certain
      period of time to promote gwaseup the greenhouse environment,
      leading to many problems such as environmental pollution. In
      addition, hot and humid as described above and the amount of light
      is insufficient House My condition is grayish fungal pathogen and
      the glass on the growth of such pathogenic bacteria, cucumbers and
      strawberries, etc. are mainly difficult pesticide in sensitive
      consumers' response to drug control because the germ the situation
      then developed the environmentally friendly control methods are
      required in addition to drug control.<br>
      <br>
      Wateuna There is also an attempt to control using antagonistic
      microbes as one of the environmentally friendly control methods, a
      step that requires a lot of effort to put into practice. On the
      other hand, promote the growth and vitality of the plants, using
      sound waves and party research has been attempted since 1860
      claimed the theory of evolution, Charles Darwin, studies on how to
      use sound waves to suppress the pest occurs in plant also tried
      recently to being. And applying the sound wave to the known
      techniques in plants is a method for promoting the growth of
      plants by applying a sound wave during the processing of plants in
      Republic of Korea Patent Publication No. 89-109 in gibberellin
      solution is disclosed, the Republic of Korea Patent No. 131 133
      discloses a frequency Growth promotion of plant by way of music is
      disclosed below 2000Hz. In addition, a method of Republic of Korea
      Patent No. 0,325,311 discloses a story-telling sound waves of a
      frequency of 2 to 20 kHz eumyeokdae the target crop pests suppress
      generation is disclosed. Method of inhibiting pest generated by
      using the sound waves as disclosed in the Republic of Korea Patent
      No. 0,325,311 but is compared with a method using a medicament has
      the advantage not to induce problems such as environmental
      pollution and water pollution, destruction of the natural ecology,
      such as , because the situation is very wide eumyeokdae of the
      cycle once heard a sonic pest as well as ikchung, and can cause
      damage to various biological systems in nature scattered around
      can not be an effective pest control method is difficult to put
      into practice. How also using experiments wateuna been done a long
      time effective eumyeokdae and processing time and proper
      conditions are difficult with the waves to investigate the same
      for controlling plant pathogens using sound waves to suppress
      certain microorganisms specifically has not been tried have. Just
      report parsley and cucumber by targeting such results were
      obtained are treated with sound waves resulting growth promotion
      has already known. The present inventors are the treatment of
      using a sound wave studying the method for inhibiting the growth
      of certain microorganisms, in particular gray mold pathogen
      (Botrytis. Cinerea), a single sound wave of a particular frequency
      on crop growth of a specific bacteria is inhibited to identify the
      occurrence of gray mold is suppressed and completed the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide a method of
      controlling gray mold disease and Growth Suppression of gray mold
      pathogen (Botrytis. Cinerea) comprising the step of treating the
      particular single sound wave to the target crop.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve the above object, the present invention
      provides a method of inhibiting mycelial growth and spore gray
      mold pathogen (Botrytiscinerea) comprising the step of treating
      the particular single sound wave. Further to another aspect of the
      invention, the invention provides a method of controlling gray
      mold comprising the step of treating the particular single sound
      wave to the target crop. Hereinafter will be described in more
      detail the contents of the present invention. The particular
      single sound wave in the present invention are selected from a
      single sound wave frequencies 250 to 500 Hz. The single sound wave
      treatment in the present invention utilizes the acoustic wave
      generating device. The sound wave generating unit include, but are
      not necessarily limited to, a computer software program called a
      sound generator (Sound generator) (Korea Advanced Institute of
      Science and Technology production) means the computer is built,
      the single sound processing steps are specifically sound wave
      generating unit and the growth phase by connecting the speaker
      installed therein refers to processing the sound waves in single
      hyphae of fungi or crops. The computer software program of the
      program is designed to have separated from the granular eumyeokdae
      unit can process by selecting one of the desired sound waves
      eumyeokdae. The noise itself extremely off growth phase in order
      to remove the influence of other sound wave of the sound wave
      other than those to be processed while the sound wave is treated
      specially manufactured was was named growth phase noise. The
      target crops in the present invention are gray mold pathogen
      (Botrytis cinerea) to gray mold refers to all crops that may be
      infected with a disease specifically strawberries, lettuce,
      cucumber, eggplant, vegetable crops such as peppers, etc. Sahib,
      gladiolus, rose by says the same floriculture crops. The present
      inventors, using sound waves to investigate the condition for
      inhibiting the growth of a particular microorganism E. coli
      (Escherichia cloi) to the frequency 50 Hz to process the result of
      a specific single sound wave selected from 5 kHz, a different
      result depending on the kind of the processed sound wave It
      showed. That could be observed that the number of colonies of
      bacteria decreases considerably compared to the untreated group in
      the case of one showed the results to reduce the number of
      colonies, even when treated with 50 or 500 Hz, to process a single
      sound wave of 125 Hz and 250 Hz .<br>
      <br>
      (See Fig. 1). Frequency of a single sound wave to inhibit the
      growth of certain microorganisms from the result learned that
      there is a suitable range. The present invention in one
      embodiment, gray mold result the bacteria processes the particular
      single sound wave selected from 5 kHz to 50 Hz frequency, a
      frequency 250 Hz and 500 Hz when the processing of a single sound
      wave Growth and sporulation of mycelial rate on the basis of the
      results of the to obtain a result that is significantly reduced in
      comparison with the untreated group. However, 50 Hz, When process
      125 Hz or 1 KHz acoustic wave, 250 Hz or 500 Hz delayed by not
      represent a significantly different than when processing the sound
      wave is different particular single sound wave affects the growth,
      depending on the type of the target microorganisms are the It
      could be seen. And transferred to a single sound wave of a
      frequency of inhibiting the growth derived from the 500 Hz single
      sound wave is treated hyphae to investigate the effects on
      sporulation of the next generation microflora of the gray mold
      pathogen (Botrytis cinerea) on fresh medium of the secondary the
      result, sound waves processed in the previous generation culture
      without acoustic treatment to affect the spore formation of the
      next generation could be observed that the spore formation
      markedly inhibited (see Fig. 8). Accordingly, the present
      invention provides a method for inhibiting the growth of gray mold
      pathogen to undergo a single sound wave from the sound wave of
      selected frequency 250 Hz to 500 Hz on the target crop. In another
      embodiment of the present invention to process a single 500 Hz
      sound wave of the inoculated spores of the gray mold pathogen
      cucumber leaf it was investigated whether or not the single sound
      wave suppressing cucumber gray mold disease. As a result, it was
      confirmed that the preventive effect of 44% to 85% (see Table 1).
      Accordingly, the present invention is to process a single sound
      wave from the sound wave of selected frequency 250 Hz to 500 Hz on
      the target crops provides a method of controlling gray mold. Via
      the below, embodiments of the present invention will now be
      described in further detail. These examples are intended for the
      scope of the invention is only to explain the invention in more
      detail but not limited to these examples.<br>
      <br>

      Escherichia coli number of colonies (colony) of E. coli
      (Escherichiacloi) specific single sound wave selected from a
      frequency 50 Hz to 5 kHz to determine the condition for inhibiting
      the growth of certain microorganisms It was processed. Sonic
      treatment was treated in a special custom-made noise-free plant
      growth sangnae order to accurately measure the particular single
      sound wave treatment effect. This is a self-generated noise about
      35-40dB growth phase in the growth environment is designed to be
      nearly maintenance noiseless conditions are useful to measure the
      effectiveness of specific sound waves. The suspension of the
      bacteria in the noise-free growth phase speaker is installed
      (1x108cfu / mL) is smeared LB solid medium (Luria Bertani:
      bacto-tryptone 10 g, bacto-yeast extract 5 g, NaCl 10 g and agar
      to 15 g / L 950 Place the dissolved in distilled water ml to
      adjust the pH to 7 the addition of 5 N NaOH in about 200 μl, and

      medium solidified by dispensing a chalet after), a sound generator
      (sound generator, Korea by using the Advanced Institute of Science
      and Technology), the frequency (50 Hz, 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1
      kHz) after processing the single sound wave for 2 hours and then
      transferred to 24 hours incubation in the growth of 37 ° C the
      solid medium observe the number of colonies of bacteria compared
      to the number of colonies on the medium are not processed by the
      sound waves is shown in Figure 1 the results. 1, the sound wave is
      obtained for the treatment medium, in particular the frequency 125
      and the number of colonies resulting from the culture medium
      significantly reduced the processing of a single sound wave 250 Hz
      compared to the control group (Fig. 1). &lt;Example 2&gt; gray
      mold pathogen bar processing conditions of the sound wave to
      inhibit the growth in accordance with the effect types of the
      target microbe in the sound waves on the (Botrytiscinerea) is
      estimated to be different, one to inhibit the growth of gray mold
      pathogen (Botrytiscinerea) to explore the frequency of a sound
      wave, 50 Hz to 5 kHz selected spore-forming bacteria by handling
      the change of gray mold in one particular sound waves, observed
      the morphological changes and changes in the next generation of
      spore-forming pathogens hyphae.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;1-1&gt; Flora, using the 6 mm bore Cork (Cork bore, diameter
      6mm) of gray mold pathogen within the growing noise of the sound
      effect of the speakers are installed on a gray mold spore forming
      bacteria potato extract medium (Potato Dextrose Agar , inoculated
      on PDA), and by using the sound generator (sound generator, Korea
      Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), the frequency (50
      Hz, 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz) processes the single sound wave
      for 2 hours and then 25 ° C incubated for two days moved on, and
      then compared the growth of mycelial growth and sporulation rate
      of the gray mold pathogen. As a result, when processing the sound
      waves to obtain a result that is significantly reduced in
      comparison with the untreated group, especially a frequency 250 Hz
      and 500 Hz sound wave single treatment of growth and sporulation
      rate of hyphae (Fig. 2). Therefore, the most effective single
      sound wave to inhibit the growth of gray mold pathogen was found
      to be of a single sound wave selected from a frequency of the
      frequency 250 Hz to 500 Hz. In addition, the inhibition of spore
      formation by the single sound wave repeatability, spore formation

      independent of the sporulation effectively suppressed in all of
      the processing time, the most effective treatment time of which
      was found to be 2 hours (Fig. 5). In conclusion, it was found that
      a single treatment of the sound waves to be repeated, continues to
      inhibit the formation of gray mold spores, germs be an effective
      method of controlling gray mold.<br>

      to the abnormal form can be observed that the ratio between the
      diaphragm and the diaphragm or or melting phenomenon. By the
      result of the above, processing of a single sound wave of the
      present invention was found to be also able to suppress not the
      mycelium of gray mold pathogen development properly and ensure
      that abnormal deformation in the mycelial growth and sporulation
      of the next generation. &lt;1-3&gt; single sound wave of the next

      the effect on the sporulation of the next generation, 500 the Hz
      of the sound waves over time (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 hours), processed
      and incubated for 5 days the colony 6 mm derived from the sound
      wave of the the colony and untreated derived from mycelia treated
      hyphae corkscrew bores ( Cork bore, shown in diameter 6mm) new

      additional incubator of 25 ° C without sonic treatment using
      (after 3 ilgan cultured in incubator) a sporulation rate in the
      results are 8 compares each It was. As shown in Figure 8, in the
      case of a single colony derived from the mycelial sound wave
      treatment of the present invention it could be seen that the spore
      formation is significantly suppressed in the next generation.
      However, the effect was clearly visible by sonic treatment time.<br>
      <br>
      From the above results, the processing of a single sound wave of
      the present invention could, as well as spore formation of gray
      mold pathogen suppresses also sporulation of the next generation
      to prevent secondary infection caused by spores scattering seen

      cucumber to 2 days and the untreated group to identify an
      appropriate sonic treatment time comparison is shown in Fig. 10
      and 11 by. The resulting sound wave is treated cucumber leaves was
      significantly inhibited the incidence of gray mold, there were no
      significant processing time in accordance with the sound waves. In
      addition, observation of the fungus 4 days leaf that after
      inoculation to ensure that the maintenance, the present invention
      of a continuous gray mold control effect by a single sound wave
      treatment, onset could see that a significant progress, the same
      as the results of 2 days aspects as compared to the untreated
      group was observed that the onset is significantly inhibited (see
      Fig. 12 and 13). Lesion with respect to the case of processing the
      same way as when processing the sound waves of 500 Hz to cucumber

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      Regulation of tomato fruit ripening may help extend fruit shelf
      life and prevent losses due to spoilage. Here, tomato fruit were
      investigated whether sound treatment could delay their ripening.
      Harvested fruit were treated with low-frequency sound waves (1.
      kHz) for 6. h, and then monitored various characteristics of the
      fruit over 14-days at 23. ±. 1. °C. Seven days after the
      treatment, 85% of the treated fruit were green, versus fewer than
      50% of the non-treated fruit. Most of the tomato fruit had
      transitioned to the red ripening stage by 14 days after treatment.
      Ethylene production and respiration rate were lower in the
      sound-treated than non-treated tomatoes. Furthermore, changes in
      surface color and flesh firmness were delayed in the treated
      fruit. To investigate how sound wave treatment effects on fruit
      ripening, the expression of ethylene-related genes was analyzed by
      quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. The expression level of
      several ethylene biosynthetic (ACS2, ACS4, ACO1, E4 and E8) and
      ripening-regulated (. RIN, TAGL1, HB-1, NOR, CNR) genes was
      influenced by sound wave treatment. These results indicated that
      sound wave treatment delays tomato fruit ripening by altering the
      expression of important genes in the ethylene biosynthesis and
      ethylene signaling pathways.<br>

      “Measuring Effects of Music, Noise, and Healing Energy Using a
      Seed Germination Bioassay. “ The objective of this 2004 study was
      to measure biologic effects of music, noise, and healing energy
      without human preferences or placebo effects using seed
      germination as an objective biomarker. A series of five
      experiments were performed utilizing okra and zucchini seeds
      germinated in acoustically shielded, thermally insulated, dark,
      humid growth chambers. Conditions compared were an untreated
      control, musical sound, pink noise, and healing energy. Healing
      energy was administered for 15-20 minutes every 12 hours with the
      intention that the treated seeds would germinate faster than the
      untreated seeds. The objective marker was the number of seeds
      sprouted out of groups of 25 seeds counted at 12-hour intervals
      over a 72-hour growing period. Temperature and relative humidity
      were monitored every 15 minutes inside the seed germination
      containers. A total of 14 trials were run testing a total of 4600
      seeds.<br>
      <br>
      Results: Musical sound had a highly statistically significant
      effect on the number of seeds sprouted compared to the untreated
      control over all five experiments for the main condition and over
      time. This effect was independent of temperature, seed type,
      position in room, specific petri dish, and person doing the
      scoring. Musical sound had a significant effect compared to noise
      and an untreated control as a function of time while there was no
      significant difference between seeds exposed to noise and an
      untreated control. Healing energy also had a significant effect
      compared to an untreated control and over time with a magnitude of
      effect comparable to that of musical sound. Conclusion: This study
      suggests that sound vibrations (music and noise) as well as
      biofields (bioelectromagnetic and healing intention) both directly
      affect living biologic systems, and that a seed germination
      bioassay has the sensitivity to enable detection of effects caused
      by various applied energetic conditions.67<br>

      <br>
      The method of stimulating a plant substance is disclosed. The
      method has the steps of activating a pressure pulse or an acoustic
      shock wave generator or source to emit pressure pulse or acoustic
      shock waves; and subjecting the plant substance to the pressure
      pulse or acoustic shock waves stimulating said plant substance
      wherein the substance is positioned within a path of the emitted
      shock waves. In one embodiment the emitted pressure pulse or shock
      waves are divergent or near planar. In another embodiment the
      emitted shock waves are convergent having a geometric focal volume
      of point at a distance of at least X from the source, the method
      further comprising positioning the substance at a distance less
      than the distance X from the source. The substance is a plant
      tissue having cells. The tissue can be a seed, zygotic embryo or
      somatic embryogenic culture of somatic embryos of plants.; The
      plant may be a vegetable, tree, shrub or tuber. The tissue may be
      a part of the root system, a part of the stem system or a part of
      the leaf system. The method of stimulating includes activating the
      cells within the treated tissue thereby releasing growth factor

      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a method for stimulating
      plant growth generally and more particularly to a method to
      accelerate embryonic stimulation and germination of seeds or
      somatic embryogenesis formation of plant clones.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Plants are cellular tissue laden organisms having a genetic
      code for each plant within each species and plant variety. Within
      these genetic codes are variations or alterations which affect
      growth rates, yield and disease resistance.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Plants provide a large source of food, clothing, building
      supplies, paper products and medicines not to mention landscaping
      and beauty.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Rainforests contain no less than 60% of all higher plant
      species known on earth and they provide all that is needed for
      human survival, including remedies for disease. Their highly
      complex molecular structures often surpass the imagination of the
      chemical scientist and cannot easily be reproduced in the
      laboratory. More than 25% of all prescription drugs in
      Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
      countries (contrasted with 60% in Eastern Europe) prove to consist
      of unmodified or slightly altered higher plant products. Natural
      drugs and medicinal plants, along with other non-timber forest
      products, already yield an important economic value. These few
      examples should make one realize how much modern drug delivery
      depends on sustainability and how vulnerable it is to the
      exhaustion of natural resources.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Plants are the source of many of our most important
      pharmaceuticals. Despite this, we know little about optimizing the
      production of these valuable secondary products in whole plants or
      cell and tissue cultures. Cultural practices to optimize
      pharmaceutical production in field or greenhouse grown plants have
      not been rigorously determined or have been of little benefit in
      increasing levels of the desired compounds. Considerable effort
      has been made to generate plant-derived pharmaceuticals
      economically in plant cell or tissue culture, with relatively few
      successes. As a result there is an apparent need to naturally
      stimulate growth and reproduction of these valuable plant species.
      The secret or key to continuing growth of such genetically complex
      plants will most likely occur by stimulation of growth factors
      within the plant's own tissues.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Commercially plants and plant products generate many
      hundreds of billions of dollars of commercial activity per year.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] World demand for plant products is increasing very rapidly.
      The world demand for paper in 1997 was expected to increase by 50%
      by the year 2010. This places a huge demand on the timber industry
      which is concurrently seeing a surge in world demand for lumber
      products.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Trees like all of our plant products are renewable and in
      order to keep pace with increasing demands, faster growing and
      maturing trees are needed to avoid rapid deforestation on a
      worldwide basis.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Plants generally are taken somewhat for granted
      particularly in their role of influencing climate changes.
      Singularly no other species has a more positive role in affecting
      the global environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] US patent publication 2005/0125161 A1 entitled
      "Differentially-Expressed Conifer cDNAS, and Their Use In
      Improving Somatic Embryogenesis" assigned to Institute of Paper
      Science and Technology provides a useful insight into current
      trends in coniferous trees and discloses a relational database of
      cDNA molecules, including those corresponding to Loblolly Pine
      Major Intrinsic Protein (MIP), which are differentially expressed
      during plant embryogenesis. The invention further related to the
      use of DNA arrays for evaluating gene expression in somatic and
      zygotic embryos. The invention encompassed related nucleic acids,
      proteins, antigens, and antibodies derived from these cDNAs as
      well as the use of such molecules for the staging,
      characterization, and manipulation of plant embryogenesis, in
      particular conifer embryogenesis. The cDNAs and related nucleic
      acids, proteins, antigens, and antibodies derived from these cDNAs
      are useful in the design, selection, and cultivation of improved
      crops, specifically including coniferous trees, which provide raw
      materials for paper and wood products.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Similarly, in US 2003/0074697 A1 entitled "Cotton Plants
      with Improved Cotton Fiber Characteristics and Methods for
      Producing Cotton Fibers From These Cotton Plants", the inventors
      extensively studied the mechanisms of fiber elongation and
      formation in cotton plants from the viewpoints of molecular
      biology to improve the characteristics of cotton fibers. As a
      result, they found that this purpose can be attained by
      introducing a gene coding for endoxyloglucan transferase, which is
      deeply associated with the cell elongation and greatly expressed
      in the cotton fibers and ovule tissues at the cotton fiber
      elongation stage, or a gene coding for catalase or peroxidase,
      which is a hydrogen peroxide eliminating enzyme, into cotton
      plants and over-expressing these genes in the cotton fiber cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The result is a finer cotton fiber with a resultant higher
      yield. In this patent these benefits are achieved in an early
      stage by detection of a positive hybridization signal only from
      cDNA probe prepared from the ovules on the fifth day of flowering.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In US 2005/0044592 entitled "Plant Growth Modulation"
      teaches the use of one or more genes, encoding a protein of the
      elongator complex to modulate plant growth wherein there results
      an over expression of the DRL-1 gene to stimulate growth of leaves
      and roots, the subject matter of this publication being
      incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] As in the other patents, stimulation occurs at the
      embryonic or early stage of plant development while the resultant
      growth modulation can occur throughout the life of the plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] To better understand the fundamental aspects of the present
      invention the complexities of plants generally should be
      appreciated. In the background of US 2005/0044592 a summary of
      plant development is recited which reports findings of a variety
      of plant scientists which is repeated below.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Plants develop mainly post-germination from an embryo with
      a rudimentary body plan. The embryonic apical-basal axis is
      delineated by apical meristems that determine the future growth
      direction of the organism. The embryonic radial axis determines
      the identity and arrangement of tissues in concentric layers.
      During development pattern formation, growth and differentiation
      are overlapping rather than consecutive events. These processes
      are reiterated throughout the life cycle upon formation of every
      new organ. Axis formation is the basis for pattern formation
      within the whole plant body, an organ or even a tissue.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In Arabidopsis, leaves initiate post-germination at
      specific positions at the periphery of the shoot apical meristem
      according to a radial pattern imposed by the plant hormone auxin
      (Reinhardt et al., 2000). The repression of the homeobox gene
      SHOOT MERISTEMLESS and the activation of the myb gene ASYMMETRIC
      (AS) are crucial for leaf initiation (Long et al., 1996; Byrne et
      al., 2000). AS imposes a dorsi-ventral asymmetry upon the radial
      symmetry of the leaf primordium (Byrne et al., 2000). Dorsal
      identity in the leaf blade is promoted by the PHABULOSA and
      PHAVOLUTA transcription factors (TF) (McConnell et al., 2001) and
      ventral identity by the YABBY and KANADI TFs (Siegfried et al.,
      1999; Sawa et al., 1999; Kerstetter et al., 2001). Four tissues
      are specified along the dorsi-ventral axis: the upper epidermis
      and palissade parenchyma with dorsal identity, the spongy
      parenchyma and the lower epidermis with ventral identity.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In the primary root the radial axis of the radicle
      (embryonic root) is reinforced by positional information that
      originates from the top to the bottom, i.e. from mature cells to
      initial cells (van den Berg et al., 1995) and polar auxin
      transport (Sabatini et al., 1999). Tissues are arranged in
      concentric layers: the epidermis, the cortex, the endodermis, the
      pericycle and the vascular bundle. SCARECROW and SHORT ROOT are
      important genes for cortex specification (Scheres et al., 1995; Di
      Laurenzio et al., 1996), TORNADO 1 &amp; 2 are important for
      epidermis specification (Cnops et al., 2000). Pattern formation in
      the primary root epidermal cell layer results in root hair cell
      files alternating with non-hair cell files which are formed at the
      anticlinal wall of two underlying cortex cells (Dolan et al.,
      1993, 1994). The gaseous hormone ethylene and auxin positively
      regulate root hair cell identity (Masucci et al., 1996).
      TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA1 and CAPRICE are positive regulators of
      root hair cell identity; GLABRA2 is a negative regulator
      (Di-Cristina et al., 1996; Wada et al., 1997; Walker et al.,
      1999).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The shoot apical meristem is essential for the formation of
      the vegetative plant body. Regulated cell division activity and
      changes in the orientation of cell plates precede the initiation
      of leaf primordia. Growth of leaf primordia occurs mainly along
      the length (proximo-distal axis) and width (centro-lateral axis)
      direction and is restricted along the thickness (dorsi-ventral
      axis) direction because of pattern formation in tissue layers.
      Early growth processes in leaves occur mainly by anticlinal cell
      divisions leading to the sheet-like structure of the blade. These
      growth processes are coupled with dorsi-ventral pattern formation
      (Siegried et al., 1999; McConnell et al., 2001; Eshed et al.,
      2001). Late growth occurs by cell expansion processes (Tsuge et
      al., 1996; Kim et al., 1998). Pattern formation in lateral growth
      results in the distinction between lamina and petiole (van der
      Graaff et al., 2000). Restriction of growth determines the final
      shape and size of the leaf organ. At flower induction, the SAM
      changes identity to an inflorescence meristem of which the
      structure and activity resembles that of the SAM except it
      produces floral meristems as lateral organs instead of leaf
      primordia. The onset of cell division in plants and animals is
      controlled at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle by the
      retinoblastoma protein that in a hypo-phosphorylated state binds
      and inactivates the general transcription factors E2F. Upon a
      mitogenic signal, such sucrose or cytokinin activated cyclin D/CDK
      complexes hyper-phosphorylate retinoblastoma and derepress E2F. By
      preventing cell cycle entry into S-phase, retinoblastoma plays a
      role in cell differentiation as well (de Jager and Murray, 1999).
      The cross-talk between cell cycle progression and developmental
      programs is a new and exciting area of research and the first
      reports have been published (Gaudin et al., 2000; De Veylder et
      al., 2001). Regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional
      level is an important and universal mechanism of controlling
      developmental programs. Classes of specific TFs recognize upstream
      promoter boxes in specific sets of genes. Through direct or
      indirect interaction with the general TFs the RNA polymerase II
      (RNAPII) transcription initiation complex is either activated or
      repressed. The specific TFs are activated by environmental or
      developmental stimuli that are transduced from the cell plasma
      membrane into the nucleus. Evidence in yeast and humans is
      accumulating that the control of expression of sets of genes is
      also mediated by the process of transcription elongation. The
      RNAPII transcription elongation complex forms the unfolded
      structure of transcribing nucleosomes (Walia et al., 1998). The
      elongation reaction is stimulated by a large variety of factors of
      which some prevent pausing or stalling of the RNAPII complex and
      others model the chromatin for transcription. The degree of
      chromatin condensation is modulated by histone acetyltransferases
      and deacetylases (Walia et al., 1998; Wittschieben et al., 1999).
      Elongating RNAPII holoenzyme co-purified with a multisubunit
      complex, Elongator, whose stable interaction is dependent on the
      hyperphosphorylated state of the RNAPII carboxy-terminal domain
      (Otero et al., 1999). The elongator complex consists of two
      subcomplexes: one consists of ELP1 (Otero et al., 1999), ELP2, a
      WD40 repeat protein (Fellows et al., 2000) and ELP3, a histone
      acetyltransferase (Wittschieben et al., 1999), the other one of
      ELP4, ELP5, and ELP6 (Krogan and Greenblatt, 2001; Winkler et al.,
      2001). Most components of Elongator are well conserved from yeast
      to man (Hawkes et al., 2001). Phenotypes of elpA mutants in yeast
      were slow growth adaptation, slow gene activation and temperature
      sensitivity and demonstrated that the ELP genes play a role in the
      activation of inducible genes in the adaptation to new growth
      conditions (Wittschieben et al., 1999; Otero et al., 1999; Fellows
      et al., 2000; Krogan and Greenblatt, 2001; Winkler et al., 2001).
      Mutations in man in one of the Elongator components cause familial
      dysautonomia, a well-known disorder (Hawkes et al., 2001). We
      identified the DEFORMED ROOT AND LEAF1 (DRL1) gene, a homolog of
      the yeast TOT4/KT112 gene (Butler et al., 1994; Frohloff et al.,
      2001). TOT genes were identified in search of mutants resistant to
      the Kluyveromyces lactis toxin zymocin. TOT1, TOT2, and TOT3 are
      isoallelic to ELP1, ELP2 and ELP3 and hence TOT equals elongator.
      TOT4/KT112 encodes a protein that associated with the elongator
      complex (Frohloff et al., 2001). The tot4 mutant displays similar
      phenotypes as deficient elongator mutants, in addition to slow
      growth, G1 cell cycle delay and hypersensitivity to Calcofluor
      White and caffeine. The inventors in US 2005/0044592 demonstrated
      that in higher plants DRL1 is important for pattern formation and
      growth processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The above related findings demonstrate that plants undergo
      a systemic response via a form of cross talk or cellular
      communication. This finding is consistent with a similar cellular
      communication found in mammals. In each organism be it a plant or
      mammal, cellular stimulation can result in a release of proteins
      and other chemical compositions relating to growth factors.<br>

      <br>
      [0024] The present invention also has the object of stimulating
      plant growth and accelerating seed germination which is summarized
      as follows.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] The method of stimulating a plant substance is disclosed.
      The method has the steps of activating a pressure pulse or an
      acoustic shock wave generator or source to emit pressure pulse or
      acoustic shock waves; and subjecting the plant substance to the
      pressure pulse or acoustic shock waves stimulating said plant
      substance wherein the substance is positioned within a path of the
      emitted shock waves. In one embodiment the emitted pressure pulse
      or shock waves are divergent or near planar. In another embodiment
      the emitted shock waves are convergent having a geometric focal
      volume of point at a distance of at least X from the source, the
      method further comprising positioning the substance at a distance
      less than the distance X from the source. The substance is a plant
      tissue having cells. The tissue can be a seed, zygotic embryo or
      somatic embryogenic culture of somatic embryos of plants. The
      plant may be a vegetable, tree, shrub or tuber. The tissue may be
      a part of the root system, a part of the stem system or a part of
      the leaf system. The method of stimulating includes activating the
      cells within the treated tissue thereby releasing growth factor
      proteins or other chemical compositions promoting growth and
      accelerating germination or plant growth. Definitions<br>
      <br>
      [0026] "Altered expression of a gene" means that in the
      genetically modified plant an amount of messenger RNA is produced
      that is significantly different from an untransformed control
      plant, grown under the same conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] "Coding sequence" is a nucleotide sequence, which is
      transcribed into mRNA and/or translated into a polypeptide when
      placed under the control of appropriate regulatory sequences. The
      boundaries of the coding sequence are determined by a translation
      start codon at the 5'-terminus and a translation stop codon at the
      3'-terminus. A coding sequence can include, but is not limited to
      mRNA, cDNA, recombinant nucleotide sequences or genomic DNA, while
      introns may be present as well under certain circumstances.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] A "curved emitter" is an emitter having a curved reflecting
      (or focusing) or emitting surface and includes, but is not limited
      to, emitters having ellipsoidal, parabolic, quasi parabolic
      (general paraboloid) or spherical reflector/reflecting or emitting
      elements. Curved emitters having a curved reflecting or focusing
      element generally produce waves having focused wave fronts, while
      curved emitters having a curved emitting surfaces generally
      produce wave having divergent wave fronts.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] "Divergent waves" in the context of the present invention
      are all waves which are not focused and are not plane or nearly
      plane. Divergent waves also include waves which only seem to have
      a focus or source from which the waves are transmitted. The wave
      fronts of divergent waves have divergent characteristics.
      Divergent waves can be created in many different ways, for
      example: A focused wave will become divergent once it has passed
      through the focal point. Spherical waves are also included in this
      definition of divergent waves and have wave fronts with divergent
      characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] "Embryo" a discrete mass of cells with a well defined
      structure that is capable of growing into a whole plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] "Extracorpreal" occurring or based outside the living body
      or plant structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] "Functional fragment of a gene" refers to a fragment of a
      gene that can be used in a functional way. Typical functional
      fragments are the promoter region and the coding sequence.
      However, the term refers also to parts of the coding sequence that
      encode for a functional fragment of the protein, i.e. a domain of
      the protein that is functional on its own.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] "Functional fragment of the protein," as used herein,
      refers to a fragment of the protein that, on its own or as part of
      a fusion protein still retains the possibility to modulate plant
      growth. Typical functional fragments are fragments essential for
      the protein-protein interaction in the elongator complex.
      Specifically for DRL1, functional fragments are the conserved
      domains from AA 56 to 94, from AA 138 to 159 (including a GTPase
      G4 consensus motif) and from AA245 to 265, the ATP/GTP binding
      domain from AA 8 to 15, and the Calmodulin-binding domain,
      comprising AA 258 to 272, preferentially comprising AA 249 to 276,
      more preferentially comprising the C-terminal 100 AA. A preferred
      embodiment is a functional fragment comprising SEQ ID NO:16,
      preferably consisting essentially of SEQ ID NO:16, even more
      preferably consisting of SEQ ID NO:16.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] "Gene," as used herein, refers both to the promoter region
      of the gene as well as the coding sequence. It refers both to the
      genomic sequence (including possible introns) as well as to the
      cDNA derived from the spliced messenger operably linked to a
      promoter sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] A "generalized paraboloid" according to the present
      invention is also a three-dimensional bowl. In two dimensions (in
      Cartesian coordinates, x and y) the formula y&lt;n&gt; =2px [with
      n being &lt;&gt;2, but being greater than about 1.2 and smaller
      than 2, or greater than 2 but smaller than about 2.8]. In a
      generalized paraboloid, the characteristics of the wave fronts
      created by electrodes located within the generalized paraboloid
      may be corrected by the selection of (p(-z,+z)), with z being a
      measure for the burn down of an electrode, and n, so that
      phenomena including, but not limited to, burn down of the tip of
      an electrode (-z,+z) and/or disturbances caused by diffraction at
      the aperture of the paraboloid are compensated for.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] "Expression of a gene," as used herein, refers to the
      transcription of the gene into messenger RNA.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] "Operably linked" refers to a juxtaposition wherein the
      components so described are in a relationship permitting them to
      function in their intended manner. A promoter sequence "operably
      linked" to a coding sequence is ligated in such a way that
      expression of the coding sequence is achieved under conditions
      compatible with the promoter sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] "Overexpression of a gene" means that more messenger RNA is
      produced in the genetically modified plant than in an
      untransformed control plant, grown under the same condition.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] "Ovule" The body which, after fertilization, becomes the
      seed.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A "paraboloid" according to the present invention is a
      three-dimensional reflecting bowl. In two dimensions (in Cartesian
      coordinates, x and y) the formula y&lt;2&gt; =2px, wherein p/2 is
      the distance of the focal point of the paraboloid from its apex,
      defines the paraboloid. Rotation of the two-dimensional figure
      defined by this formula around its longitudinal axis generates a
      defacto paraboloid.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] "Plane waves" are sometimes also called flat or even waves.
      Their wave fronts have plane characteristics (also called even or
      parallel characteristics). The amplitude in a wave front is
      constant and the "curvature" is flat (that is why these waves are
      sometimes called flat waves). Plane waves do not have a focus to
      which their fronts move (focused) or from which the fronts are
      emitted (divergent). "Nearly plane waves" also do not have a focus
      to which their fronts move (focused) or from which the fronts are
      emitted (divergent). The amplitude of their wave fronts (having
      "nearly plane" characteristics) is approximating the constancy of
      plain waves. "Nearly plane" waves can be emitted by generators
      having pressure pulse/shock wave generating elements with flat
      emitters or curved emitters. Curved emitters may comprise a
      generalized paraboloid that allows waves having nearly plane
      characteristics to be emitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A "pressure pulse" according to the present invention is an
      acoustic pulse which includes several cycles of positive and
      negative pressure. The amplitude of the positive part of such a
      cycle should be above about 0.1 MPa and its time duration is from
      below a microsecond to about a second. Rise times of the positive
      part of the first pressure cycle may be in the range of
      nano-seconds (ns) up to some milli-seconds (ms). Very fast
      pressure pulses are called shock waves. Shock waves used in
      medical applications do have amplitudes above 0.1 MPa and rise
      times of the amplitude are below 100 ns. The duration of a shock
      wave is typically below 1-3 micro-seconds ([mu]s) for the positive
      part of a cycle and typically above some micro-seconds for the
      negative part of a cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] "Promoter of a gene" as used herein, refers to a functional
      DNA sequence unit that, when operably linked to a coding sequence
      and possibly placed in the appropriate inducing conditions, is
      sufficient to promote transcription of the coding sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] "A protein of the elongator complex," as used herein, means
      that the protein belongs to the multisubunit complex Elongator, as
      known to the person skilled in the art or to a protein associating
      with the complex. Preferentially, the protein has structural
      and/or functional homology with one of the proteins ELP1, ELP2,
      ELP3, ELP4, ELP5, ELP6 or TOT4/KT112 as described in Saccharomyces
      cerevisiae.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] "seed" The ripened ovule, consisting of the embryo and its
      proper coats.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] "Somatic Embryogenesis" a type of plant tissue culture
      where a piece of a donor plant is excised, cultured ad induced to
      form multiple embryos.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Waves/wave fronts described as being "focused" or "having
      focusing characteristics" means in the context of the present
      invention that the respective waves or wave fronts are traveling
      and increase their amplitude in direction of the focal point. Per
      definition the energy of the wave will be at a maximum in the
      focal point or, if there is a focal shift in this point, the
      energy is at a maximum near the geometrical focal point. Both the
      maximum energy and the maximal pressure amplitude may be used to
      define the focal point.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] "Zygotic Embryogenesis" is a sexual or asexual reproductive
      process that forms new plants. The process of embryogenesis may
      occur naturally in the plant as a result of sexual fertilization
      or asexual processes, these embryos are called zygotic embryos and
      develop into seeds, which germinate giving rise to seedlings.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>

      [0070] The present invention relates to the use of various
      pressure pulse wave patterns or acoustic shock wave patterns as
      illustrated in FIGS. 1-12 for stimulating plant growth. Each
      illustrated wave pattern will be discussed later in the
      description; however, the use of each has particularly interesting
      beneficial features that are a remarkably valuable new tool in the
      effort to accelerate plant growth and production.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The present invention employs the use of pressure pulses or
      shock waves to stimulate a cellular response stimulating a tissue
      growth process that activates the tissue to initiate a systemic
      growth process.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In the pressure pulse or shock wave method of treating a
      plant tissue, a zygotic embryo or seed or somatic embryos of the
      plant or cultures of such embryos are positioned in a convenient
      orientation to permit the source of the emitted waves to most
      directly send the waves to the target site to initiate pressure
      pulse or shock wave stimulation of the target area or zone with
      minimal, preferably with little or no obstructing features in the
      path of the emitting source or lens. Assuming the treatment region
      is accessible through an open access region then the shock wave
      head 43 can be inserted and placed directly on or adjacent to the
      treatment region 200. Assuming the target area or site is within a
      projected area of the wave transmission, a single transmission
      dosage of wave energy may be used. The transmission dosage can be
      from a few seconds to 20 minutes or more dependent on the
      condition. Preferably the waves are generated from an unfocused or
      focused source. The unfocused waves can be divergent, planar or
      near planar and having a low pressure amplitude and density in the
      range of 0.00001 mJ/mm&lt;2 &gt; to 1.0 mJ/mm&lt;2 &gt; or less,
      most typically below 0.2 mJ/mm&lt;2&gt; . The focused source
      preferably can use a diffusing lens or have a far-sight focus to
      minimize if not eliminate having the localized focus point within
      the tissue. Preferably the focused shock waves are used at a
      similarly effective low energy transmission or alternatively can
      be at higher energy but wherein the tissue target site is disposed
      pre-convergence inward of the geometric focal point of the emitted
      wave transmission. In treating some hard to penetrate regions, the
      pressure pulse more preferably is a high energy target focused
      wave pattern which can effectively penetrate through outer
      structures prior to being dampened while still exposing the plant
      to activating pressure pulses or shock waves. This emitted energy
      preferably stimulates the plant cells without rupturing cellular
      membranes. The surrounding healthy cells in the region treated are
      activated initiating a growth mechanism response stimulating new
      growth. In the case of embryonic tissues, the cells are activated
      stimulating accelerated germination when planted in a nutrient
      rich environment such as soil.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] These shock wave energy transmissions are effective in
      stimulating a cellular response and can be accomplished without
      creating the cavitation bubbles in the tissue of the target site
      when employed in other than site targeted high energy focused
      transmissions. This effectively insures the tissue or plant does
      not have to experience the sensation of cellular membrane
      rupturing so common in the higher energy focused wave forms having
      a focal point at or within the targeted treatment site.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] This method permits the lens or cover of the emitting shock
      wave source to impinge on the plant or tissue directly or through
      a transmission enhancing gel, water or fluid medium during the
      pressure pulse or shock wave treatment. The treated area can
      withstand a far greater number of shock waves based on the
      selected energy level being emitted. For example at very low
      energy levels the stimulation exposure can be provided over
      prolonged periods as much as 20 minutes if so desired. At higher
      energy levels the treatment duration can be shortened to less than
      a minute, less than a second if so desired. The limiting factor in
      the selected treatment dosage is avoidance or minimization of
      surrounding cell rupturing and other kinds of damage to the
      surrounding cells or tissue while still providing a stimulating
      cell activation or a cellular release or activation of proteins or
      functional fragments of the protein or other chemical composition
      that modulates growth factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The underlying principle of these pressure pulse or shock
      wave therapy methods is to enrich the treatment area directly and
      to stimulate the plant's own natural growth capability. This is
      accomplished by deploying shock waves to stimulate cells in the
      surrounding tissue to activate a variety of responses. The
      acoustic shock waves transmit or trigger what appears to be a
      cellular communication throughout the entire anatomical structure,
      this activates a generalized cellular response at the treatment
      site, in particular, but more interestingly a systemic response in
      areas more removed from the wave form pattern. This is believed to
      be one of the reasons molecular stimulation can be conducted at
      threshold energies heretofore believed to be well below those
      commonly accepted as required. Accordingly not only can the energy
      intensity be reduced in some cases, but also the number of applied
      shock wave impulses can be lowered from several thousand to as few
      as one or more pulses and still yield a beneficial stimulating
      response. The key is to provide at least a sufficient amount of
      energy to activate growth reactions. The treatment is particularly
      beneficial in early stages of plant growth, but also can be
      employed with appropriate transmission medias to treat infected or
      damaged mature plants such as infected trees which when subjected
      to shock waves activates a cellular defense response to an
      intrusion of for example parasitic diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Ideally the present invention is best suited for large
      scale farming and nursery operations where seedlings are harvested
      in large quantities.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] As shown in FIG. 13 the treated plant tissue can be seeds,
      zygotic embryos, or somatic embryogenesis cells placed in a
      nutrient rich environment or culture medium which easily allows
      the transmitted waves to pass through each seed or cluster of
      embryogenic cells to trigger the growth protein modulation.
      Thereafter the treated plant tissues can be planted in soil or
      nutrient medium to initiate root generation and full germination.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In practice treated bean seeds were planted along with
      untreated control seeds. The treated seeds sprouted on average two
      days before the control seeds. This finding is consistent with the
      findings of a Canadian patent 2,376,695 which used an array of
      magnets to produce a magnetic field in proximity to the planted
      seeds. The distinction and benefit of the present invention is the
      treatment is applied one time to a mass quantity of seeds prior to
      planting. The cellular stimulation having been triggered no
      further stimulation was required. The vegetative foliage of the
      treated bean plants was superior in growth and appearance as well
      evidencing a pronounced long-term benefit.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Additional shelf life testing needs to be conducted to see
      if the effect of shock waves is transitory. That is how long
      treated seeds, embryos or seedlings can be held in storage until
      planting and still see the beneficial accelerated germination and
      improved quality of plant structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] As further shown in FIG. 13 the pressure pulse or shock
      wave head 43 can be immersed in a nutrient rich fluid medium or
      culture 120 of zygotic embryos, seeds or somatic embryos or
      embryonic tissues 100. The treated tissue 100 can be one or more
      such embryo or seeds 100, preferably many more. As shown a large
      container or vat 110 is shown holding many thousands of such plant
      tissues 100. The shock wave head 43 is connected via cabling 42
      base to a wave generator or source (not illustrated). After
      treating the plant tissue or seeds 100 the treated embryonic
      plants can be potted or planted to initiate the germination
      process. As can be appreciated such a process is also ideally
      suited for hydroponic planting processes as well. The treated
      plant tissues can form trees, bushes, tubers, cotton, or
      vegetables like soybean, corn, peanuts, beans, melons, citrus
      fruit trees, avocados or any other plants including grasses. The
      plants may be of flowering varieties or seed producing varieties
      such as walnut, pecan and other tree born nut producing plants.
      The resultant treated plant tissue may be of a plant variety which
      is used in manufacture of medicines or other pharmaceutical drugs.
      The treatment may be directed to the root system and stimulation
      thereof or the leaf system or stem. The treated tissue may be at a
      graft site or may be plant tissue of one or more zygotic embryos
      or one or more somatic embryos which is micro-propagated from
      somatic embryo in vitro from minute pieces of tissue or individual
      cells such as in cloning.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Assuming the treated seeds need not be potted or planted
      immediately then the above method could have an important role in
      large scale seed production. Otherwise the beneficial attributes
      may be better suited for nurseries and large scale planting
      operations wherein improved plant growth rates are financially
      rewarding.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Nevertheless the use of such pressure pulses and acoustic
      shock waves can be very beneficial to plant production in terms of
      accelerated growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] FIG. 1a is a simplified depiction of the a pressure
      pulse/shock wave (PP/SW) generator, such as a shock wave head,
      showing focusing characteristics of transmitted acoustic pressure
      pulses. Numeral 1 indicates the position of a generalized pressure
      pulse generator, which generates the pressure pulse and, via a
      focusing element, focuses it outside the housing to treat plants
      or embryos of plants. The affected plant tissue is generally
      located in or near the focal point which is located in or near
      position 6. At position 17 a water cushion or any other kind of
      exit window for the acoustical energy is located.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] FIG. 1b is a simplified depiction of a pressure pulse/shock
      wave generator, such as a shock wave head, with plane wave
      characteristics. Numeral 1 indicates the position of a pressure
      pulse generator according to the present invention, which
      generates a pressure pulse which is leaving the housing at the
      position 17, which may be a water cushion or any other kind of
      exit window. Somewhat even (also referred to herein as
      "disturbed") wave characteristics can be generated, in case a
      paraboloid is used as a reflecting element, with a point source
      (e.g. electrode) that is located in the focal point of the
      paraboloid. The waves will be transmitted into the plant tissue
      via a coupling media such as, e.g., ultrasound gel or oil or a
      nutrient rich fluid and their amplitudes will be attenuated with
      increasing distance from the exit window 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] FIG. 1c is a simplified depiction of a pressure pulse shock
      wave generator (shock wave head) with divergent wave
      characteristics. The divergent wave fronts may be leaving the exit
      window 17 at point 11 where the amplitude of the wave front is
      very high. This point 17 could be regarded as the source point for
      the pressure pulses. In FIG. 1c the pressure pulse source may be a
      point source, that is, the pressure pulse may be generated by an
      electrical discharge of an electrode under water between electrode
      tips. However, the pressure pulse may also be generated, for
      example, by an explosion, referred to as a ballistic pressure
      pulse. The divergent characteristics of the wave front may be a
      consequence of the mechanical setup shown in FIG. 2b.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] FIG. 2a is a simplified depiction of a pressure pulse/shock
      wave generator (shock wave head) according to the present
      invention having an adjustable or exchangeable (collectively
      referred to herein as "movable") housing around the pressure wave
      path. The apparatus is shown in a focusing position. FIG. 2a is
      similar to FIG. 1a but depicts an outer housing (16) in which the
      acoustical pathway (pressure wave path) is located. In a preferred
      embodiment, this pathway is defined by especially treated water
      (for example, temperature controlled, conductivity and gas content
      adjusted water) and is within a water cushion or within a housing
      having a permeable membrane, which is acoustically favorable for
      the transmission of the acoustical pulses. In certain embodiments,
      a complete outer housing (16) around the pressure pulse/shock wave
      generator (1) may be adjusted by moving this housing (16) in
      relation to, e.g., the focusing element in the generator. However,
      as the person skilled in the art will appreciate, this is only one
      of many embodiments of the present invention. While the figure
      shows that the exit window (17) may be adjusted by a movement of
      the complete housing (16) relative to the focusing element, it is
      clear that a similar, if not the same, effect can be achieved by
      only moving the exit window, or, in the case of a water cushion,
      by filling more water in the volume between the focusing element
      and the cushion. FIG. 2a shows the situation in which the
      arrangement transmits focused pressure pulses.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] FIG. 2b is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having an adjustable
      or exchangeable housing around the pressure wave path with the
      exit window 17 being in the highest energy divergent position. The
      configuration shown in FIG. 2b can, for example, be generated by
      moving the housing (16) including the exit window (17), or only
      the exit window (17) of a water cushion, towards the right (as
      shown in the Figure) to the second focus f2 (20) of the acoustic
      waves. In a preferred embodiment, the energy at the exit window
      will be maximal. Behind the focal point, the waves may be moving
      with divergent characteristics (21).<br>
      <br>
      [0088] FIG. 2c is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having an adjustable
      or exchangeable housing around the pressure wave path in a low
      energy divergent position. The adjustable housing or water cushion
      is moved or expanded much beyond f2 position (20) so that highly
      divergent wave fronts with low energy density values are leaving
      the exit window (17) and may be coupled to a plant tissue. Thus,
      an appropriate adjustment can change the energy density of a wave
      front without changing its characteristic.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] This apparatus may, in certain embodiments, be
      adjusted/modified/or the complete shock wave head or part of it
      may be exchanged so that the desired and/or optimal acoustic
      profile such as one having wave fronts with focused, planar,
      nearly plane, convergent or divergent characteristics can be
      chosen.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] A change of the wave front characteristics may, for
      example, be achieved by changing the distance of the exit acoustic
      window relative to the reflector, by changing the reflector
      geometry, by introducing certain lenses or by removing elements
      such as lenses that modify the waves produced by a pressure
      pulse/shock wave generating element. Exemplary pressure
      pulse/shock wave sources that can, for example, be exchanged for
      each other to allow an apparatus to generate waves having
      different wave front characteristics are described in detail
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In certain embodiments, the change of the distance of the
      exit acoustic window can be accomplished by a sliding movement.
      However, in other embodiments of the present invention, in
      particular, if mechanical complex arrangements, the movement can
      be an exchange of mechanical elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In one embodiment, mechanical elements that are exchanged
      to achieve a change in wave front characteristics include the
      primary pressure pulse generating element, the focusing element,
      the reflecting element, the housing and the membrane. In another
      embodiment, the mechanical elements further include a closed fluid
      volume within the housing in which the pressure pulse is formed
      and transmitted through the exit window.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In one embodiment, the apparatus of the present invention
      is used in combination therapy. Here, the characteristics of waves
      emitted by the apparatus are switched from, for example, focused
      to divergent or from divergent with lower energy density to
      divergent with higher energy density. Thus, effects of a pressure
      pulse treatment can be optimized by using waves having different
      characteristics and/or energy densities, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] While the above described universal toolbox of the present
      invention provides versatility, the person skilled in the art will
      appreciate that apparatuses that only produce waves having, for
      example, nearly plane characteristics, are less mechanically
      demanding and fulfill the requirements of many users.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] As the person skilled in the art will also appreciate that
      embodiments shown in the drawings are independent of the
      generation principle and thus are valid for not only
      electro-hydraulic shock wave generation but also for, but not
      limited to, PP/SW generation based on electromagnetic,
      piezoceramic and ballistic principles. The pressure pulse
      generators may, in certain embodiments, be equipped with a water
      cushion that houses water which defines the path of pressure pulse
      waves that is, through which those waves are transmitted. In a
      preferred embodiment, a plant tissue is coupled via a nutrient
      rich fluid, ultrasound gel or oil to the acoustic exit window
      (17), which can, for example, be an acoustic transparent membrane,
      a water cushion, a plastic plate or a metal plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] FIG. 3 is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave apparatus having no focusing reflector or other
      focusing element. The generated waves emanate from the apparatus
      without coming into contact with any focusing elements. FIG. 3
      shows, as an example, an electrode as a pressure pulse generating
      element producing divergent waves (28) behind the ignition point
      defined by a spark between the tips of the electrode (23, 24).<br>
      <br>
      [0097] FIG. 4a is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having as focusing
      element an ellipsoid (30). Thus, the generated waves are focused
      at (6).<br>
      <br>
      [0098] FIG. 4b is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having as a focusing
      element an paraboloid (y&lt;2&gt; =2px). Thus, the characteristics
      of the wave fronts generated behind the exit window (33, 34, 35,
      and 36) are disturbed plane ("parallel"), the disturbance
      resulting from phenomena ranging from electrode burn down, spark
      ignition spatial variation to diffraction effects. However, other
      phenomena might contribute to the disturbance.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] FIG. 4c is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having as a focusing
      element a generalized paraboloid (y&lt;n&gt; =2px, with
      1.2&lt;n&lt;2.8 and n&lt;&gt;2). Thus, the characteristics of the
      wave fronts generated behind the exit window (37, 38, 39, and 40)
      are, compared to the wave fronts generated by a paraboloid
      (y&lt;2&gt; =2px), less disturbed, that is, nearly plane (or
      nearly parallel or nearly even (37, 38, 39, 40)). Thus,
      conformational adjustments of a regular paraboloid (y&lt;2&gt;
      =2px) to produce a generalized paraboloid can compensate for
      disturbances from, e.g., electrode burn down. Thus, in a
      generalized paraboloid, the characteristics of the wave front may
      be nearly plane due to its ability to compensate for phenomena
      including, but not limited to, burn down of the tips of the
      electrode and/or for disturbances caused by diffraction at the
      aperture of the paraboloid. For example, in a regular paraboloid
      (y&lt;2&gt; =2px) with p=1.25, introduction of a new electrode may
      result in p being about 1.05. If an electrode is used that adjusts
      itself to maintain the distance between the electrode tips
      ("adjustable electrode") and assuming that the electrodes burn
      down is 4 mm (z=4 mm), p will increase to about 1.45. To
      compensate for this burn down, and here the change of p, and to
      generate nearly plane wave fronts over the life span of an
      electrode, a generalized paraboloid having, for example n=1.66 or
      n=2.5 may be used. An adjustable electrode is, for example,
      disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,531.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] FIG. 4d shows sectional views of a number of paraboloids.
      Numeral 62 indicates a paraboloid of the shape y&lt;2&gt; =2px
      with p=0.9 as indicated by numeral 64 at the x axis which
      specifies the p/2 value (focal point of the paraboloid). Two
      electrode tips of a new electrode 66 (inner tip) and 67 (outer
      tip) are also shown in the Figure. If the electrodes are fired and
      the tips are burning down the position of the tips change, for
      example, to position 68 and 69 when using an electrode which
      adjusts its position to compensate for the tip burn down. In order
      to generate pressure pulse/shock waves having nearly plane
      characteristics, the paraboloid has to be corrected in its p
      value. The p value for the burned down electrode is indicate by 65
      as p/2=1. This value, which constitutes a slight exaggeration, was
      chosen to allow for an easier interpretation of the Figure. The
      corresponding paraboloid has the shape indicated by 61, which is
      wider than paraboloid 62 because the value of p is increased. An
      average paraboloid is indicated by numeral 60 in which p=1.25 cm.
      A generalized paraboloid is indicated by dashed line 63 and
      constitutes a paraboloid having a shape between paraboloids 61 and
      62. This particular generalized paraboloid was generated by
      choosing a value of n&lt;&gt;2 and a p value of about 1.55 cm. The
      generalized paraboloid compensates for different p values that
      result from the electrode burn down and/or adjustment of the
      electrode tips.<br>

      [0101] FIG. 5 is a simplified depiction of a set-up of the
      pressure pulse/shock wave generator (43) (shock wave head) and a
      control and power supply unit (41) for the shock wave head (43)
      connected via electrical cables (42) which may also include water
      hoses that can be used in the context of the present invention.
      However, as the person skilled in the art will appreciate, other
      set-ups are possible and within the scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] FIG. 6 is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having an
      electromagnetic flat coil 50 as the generating element. Because of
      the plane surface of the accelerated metal membrane of this
      pressure pulse/shock wave generating element, it emits nearly
      plane waves which are indicated by lines 51. In shock wave heads,
      an acoustic lens 52 is generally used to focus these waves. The
      shape of the lens might vary according to the sound velocity of
      the material it is made of. At the exit window 17 the focused
      waves emanate from the housing and converge towards focal point 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] FIG. 7 is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having an
      electromagnetic flat coil 50 as the generating element. Because of
      the plane surface of the accelerated metal membrane of this
      generating element, it emits nearly plane waves which are
      indicated by lines 51. No focusing lens or reflecting lens is used
      to modify the characteristics of the wave fronts of these waves,
      thus nearly plane waves having nearly plane characteristics are
      leaving the housing at exit window 17.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] FIG. 8 is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) having an
      piezoceramic flat surface with piezo crystals 55 as the generating
      element. Because of the plane surface of this generating element,
      it emits nearly plane waves which are indicated by lines 51. No
      focusing lens or reflecting lens is used to modify the
      characteristics of the wave fronts of these waves, thus nearly
      plane waves are leaving the housing at exit window 17. Emitting
      surfaces having other shapes might be used, in particular curved
      emitting surfaces such as those shown in FIGS. 4a to 4c as well as
      spherical surfaces. To generate waves having nearly plane or
      divergent characteristics, additional reflecting elements or
      lenses might be used. The crystals might, alternatively, be
      stimulated via an electronic control circuit at different times,
      so that waves having plane or divergent wave characteristics can
      be formed even without additional reflecting elements or lenses.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] FIG. 9 is a simplified depiction of the pressure
      pulse/shock wave generator (shock wave head) comprising a
      cylindrical electromagnet as a generating element 53 and a first
      reflector having a triangular shape to generate nearly plane waves
      54 and 51. Other shapes of the reflector or additional lenses
      might be used to generate divergent waves as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] With reference to FIGS. 10, 11 and 12 a schematic view of a
      shock wave generator or source 1 is shown emitting a shock wave
      front 200 from an exit window 17. The shock wave front 200 has
      converging waves 202 extending to a focal point or focal geometric
      volume 20 at a location spaced a distance X from the generator or
      source 1. Thereafter the wave front 200 passes from the focal
      point or geometric volume 20 in a diverging wave pattern as has
      been discussed in the various other FIGS. 1-9 generally.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] With particular reference to FIG. 10 a plant tissue 100 is
      shown generally centered on the focal point or volume 20 at a
      location X0 within the tissue 100. In this orientation the emitted
      waves are focused and thus are emitting a high intensity acoustic
      energy at the location X0. This location X0 can be anywhere within
      or on the tissue 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] With reference to FIG. 11, the plant tissue 100 is shifted
      a distance X toward the generator or source 1. The tissue 100 at
      location X0 being positioned a distance X-X1 from the source 1.
      This insures the tissue 100 is impinged by converging waves 202
      but removed from the focal point 20. When the tissue 100 is
      impacted, this bombardment of converging waves 202 stimulates the
      cells activating the desired response as previously discussed.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] With reference to FIG. 12, the tissue 100 is shown shifted
      or located in the diverging wave portion 204 of the wave front
      200. As shown X0 is now at a distance X2 from the focal point or
      geometric volume 20 located at a distance X from the source 1.
      Accordingly X0 is located a distance X+X2 from the source 1. As in
      FIG. 10 this region of diverging waves 204 can be used to
      stimulate the tissue 100 which when the tissue is a cellular
      tissue stimulates the cells to produce the desired growth effect
      or response.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] As shown in FIGS. 1-12 the use of these various acoustic
      shock wave forms can be used separately or in combination to
      achieve the desired effect of stimulating growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Furthermore such acoustic shock wave forms can be used in
      combination with chemical treatments, gene therapy or cloning or
      plant grafting or cross pollination methods and when so combined
      the stimulated cells will more rapidly grow increasing
      productivity and potentially improving yields.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] The present invention provides an apparatus for an
      effective treatment of plant tissues, which benefit from high or
      low energy pressure pulse/shock waves having focused or unfocused,
      nearly plane, convergent or even divergent characteristics. With
      an unfocused wave having nearly plane, plane, convergent wave
      characteristic or even divergent wave characteristics, the energy
      density of the wave may be or may be adjusted to be so low that
      side effects including cellular membrane damage do not exist at
      all.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] In certain embodiments, the apparatus of the present
      invention is able to produce waves having energy density values
      that are below 0.1 mJ/mm2 or even as low as 0.000 001 mJ/mm2. In a
      preferred embodiment, those low end values range between 0.1-0.001
      mJ/mm2. With these low energy densities, side effects are reduced
      and the dose application is much more uniform. Additionally, the
      possibility of harming surface tissue is reduced when using an
      apparatus of the present invention that generates unfocused waves
      having planar, nearly plane, convergent or divergent
      characteristics and larger transmission areas compared to
      apparatuses using a focused shock wave source that need to be
      moved around to cover the treated area. The apparatus of the
      present invention also may allow the user to make more precise
      energy density adjustments than an apparatus generating only
      focused shock waves, which is generally limited in terms of
      lowering the energy output.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] The treatment of the above mentioned plant tissue or body
      of a plant is believed to be a first time use of acoustic shock
      wave therapy. None of the work done to date has treated the above
      mentioned plant treatments with convergent, divergent, planar or
      near-planar acoustic unfocused shock waves of low energy or high
      energy focused shock waves in a transmission path from the
      emitting source lens or cover to the target site.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] It will be appreciated that the apparatuses and processes
      of the present invention can have a variety of embodiments, only a
      few of which are disclosed herein. It will be apparent to the
      artisan that other embodiments exist and do not depart from the
      spirit of the invention. Thus, the described embodiments are
      illustrative and should not be construed as restrictive.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] The use of acoustic shock waves to plant tissue stimulates
      a cellular response of the treated tissues as well as a cellular
      response in any surrounding tissue. This response activates
      otherwise dormant cells to increase the plant's growth mechanisms,
      allowing the cells to rapidly replicate to initiate the growth
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] A further benefit of the use of acoustic shock waves is
      there are no known adverse indications when combined with the use
      of other nutrients. In fact the activation of the cells exposed to
      shock wave treatments only enhances cellular absorption of such
      nutrients making them faster acting than when compared to non
      stimulated cells. As a result, it is envisioned that the use of
      one or more nutrients prior to, during or after subjecting the
      plant tissue to acoustic shock waves will be complimentary to the
      treatment or pre-conditioning treatment. It is further appreciated
      that certain uses of pesticides can be altered or modified to
      lower risk or adverse side effects when combined with a treatment
      involving acoustic shock waves as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Another aspect of the present invention is the use of
      acoustic shock waves can be combined with organic food farming.
      The treatment does not require genetic alteration or manipulation
      to accelerate the otherwise natural growth of plant tissue as such
      the use of acoustic shock waves is compatible with organic farming
      practices as well as the new fields of genetic engineering.<br>

      <br>
      <b>FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] These teachings involve equipment and methods for
      horticultural and agricultural productivity enhancement.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The field of cultivating plants has spurred technological
      advances from the plow, to artificial irrigation, to hybridization
      and now to advances in the application of DNA research. In the
      area of subtle influences that alter a plants environment, some
      have experimented with “talking to their plants” and playing
      Mozart for them. While neither of those techniques has found
      widespread use, there is a growing body of serious research
      regarding the effects of sound and vibrations on plant growth.
      Like all living organisms, plants have highly complex sensory
      networks for monitoring their surroundings, and are known to
      modify their growth and development to suit their environment. For
      example, plants exposed to a variety of mechanical perturbations,
      such as wind or touch, undergo physiological and developmental
      changes that enhance resistance to subsequent mechanical stress.
      Developmental changes in response to mechano-stimulation are
      collectively known as thigmomorphogenesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The short paper “Biochemical and physiological changes in
      plants as a result of different sonic exposures” by Yu-Chuan Qin,
      Won-Chu Lee, Young-Cheol Choi and Tae-Wan Kim that was published
      in Elsevier's Ultrasonics journal (41 (2003) 407-41) investigates
      the biochemical mechanisms that might be involved in some of these
      phenomena. Chinese cabbage and cucumbers at two growth stages were
      the researchers' subjects. For each plant type three groups were
      constituted. Besides a control group that was not subject to any
      artificial acoustic treatment, one group was exposed to steady
      ultrasonic (US) waves of 20 k Hz, while the other was exposed to
      so-called “green music” (GM) consisting of a combination of
      classical music and natural sounds including bird songs. Both O2
      intake and polyamines content were measured. In brief, they found
      Chinese cabbage reacting more positively to the GM and the
      cucumbers to the US. However, for each quantity measured, either
      one or the other or both of the sonically exposed plants had
      greater readings than those of the control plants. That paper's
      charts of the polyamines content measurements are reproduced as
      FIGS. 1A and 1B. The caption of the Chinese cabbage growth graph
      in that paper is:<br>
      <br>
      “Polyamine content (nmol/gFW) of Chinese cabbage seedlings: (A) 15
      d and (B) mature plant (70 d) as a result of different acoustic
      exposures. Error bars represent the standard deviations of the
      means of polyamine contents.” And the caption in that paper of the
      cucumber data is: “Polyamine content (nmol/gFW) of cucumber
      seedlings: (A) 15 d and (B) mature plant (70 d) as a result of
      different acoustic treatments. Error bars represent the standard
      deviations of the means of polyamine contents.”<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Studies have also focused on specific frequencies' effects,
      for example “Plant gene responses to frequency-specific sound
      signals”, Mi-Jeong Jeong, Chang-Ki Shim, Jin-Ohk Lee, Hawk-Bin
      Kwon, Yang-Han Kim, Seong-Kon Lee, Myeong-Ok Byun and Soo-Chul
      Park. (Mol Breeding (2008) 21:217-226) published Springer's
      Molecular Breeding journal. They demonstrated sound affecting
      plant growth through mRNA expression analyses.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Others have looked at the issue of the effect of vibration
      on plant growth. One relevant article is: “Growth Promotion by
      Vibration at 50 Hz in Rice and Cucumber Seedlings”, Hideyuki
      Takahashi, Hiroshi Suge and Tadashi Kato. (Plant CellPhysiol.
      32(5): 729-732 (1991)). They looked at the effect of 50 Hz
      vibration and mention that a motivation of their study was the
      issue that motors and other mechanical apparatus in a green house
      might produce sounds with unintended and unexpected effects on
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] FIG. 3 shows a reproduction of that paper's “FIG. 1.” Its
      caption is:<br>
      <br>
      “Germination of rice and cucumber seeds as affected by vibration
      at 50 Hz Data is shown as the percentage of germinated seeds in a
      time-course study. Top (A), rice seeds under submerged conditions;
      middle (B), rice seeds on filter paper; bottom C), cucumber seeds
      on filter paper. Open (O) and closed circles indicate the control
      and the vibrated seeds, respectively. One hundred seeds were used
      for each treatment.”<br>
      <br>
      [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 7,600,343 dated Oct. 13, 2009 by Reiner
      Schultheiss, et al, discusses the effect of shock waves on plant
      growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] However, previous attempts to improve plant growth along
      the lines of the research above have not made it into routine,
      large-scale, commercial use. Systems and methods are needed which
      can improve plant growth in ways compatible with our current
      environmental imperatives that are also inexpensive to deploy and
      maintain. Preferably, solutions would avoid chemical fertilizers
      and chemical pesticides and be simple to deploy in both the
      developed world and the developing world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0012] System and methods consistent with these teachings involve
      two counter-rotating geometric space frame structures that may be
      thought of as concentric. When energized and operated proximate to
      growing plants, the growth rate of those plants can be enhanced.
      Experimental results have shown its operation to be associated
      with effective increase in plant growth.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>[0028] Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      [0029] The global population is estimated to reach 9 billion
      people by 2050. There is an increasing loss of arable land caused
      by desertification and decreasing water supplies caused by melting
      glaciers and erratic precipitation patterns. It may be difficult
      to feed the world's population in the future. Equipment and
      methods to enhance plant growth are therefore of high global
      importance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0030] Structure</b><br>
      <br>
      [0031] In a first example embodiment seen in FIG. 4, a machine
      includes a platform 100 supporting a vertical axle 101. Rotatably
      coupled to the axle are an inner armature 102 and an outer
      armature 103. Each of these armatures is supported by respective
      bearings 104 104 and are arranged to separately, freely rotate
      about the axle. A source of motive force in this example, are two
      DC motors 105 and are mechanically connected by belt drives 106 to
      each armature to provide for their respective rotation in opposite
      directions. In this first example device, the outer armature 103
      revolves clock-wise with the inner armature 102 going
      counter-clockwise. The relative rotation of the armatures is not
      set to a fixed relationship by mutual gearing, for example. The
      motors are capable of being adjusted to cause each armature to
      rotate in a range of 400 to 500 rotations per minute. In this
      example the upper surface of the top supports a solar cell panel
      402 that provides the energy to operate the motors. Those skilled
      in the art will be familiar with the specific current requirements
      of various motors that may be used and the energy storage than may
      be required. In this example the electricity from the solar panels
      is used to charge batteries. The motors, under the control of a
      timer and speed controllers, is then driven from the batteries.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0032] Armatures</b><br>
      <br>
      [0033] The inner and outer armatures of this version are each a
      geometric frame constructed from stainless steel rods. Aluminum
      rods may also be used. The armatures are of the same geometric
      configuration with the difference being that the outer armature
      103 is a scaled up instance of the configuration of the inner
      armature 102. Therefore the inner armature will be initially
      described in isolation. This also allows for clearer drawings than
      those showing the entire machine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0034] Inner Armature</b><br>
      <br>
      [0035] Its height is the dimension that would be from its top to
      its bottom when configured on the axle on the platform in a usage
      configuration. In this first version the inner armature's 102
      overall height, is about 28.5 inches. The upper-most and
      lower-most elements are rods of a diameter of about 3⁄8″, centered
      within the armature body that fits over the axle. The armature can
      be thought of as a space frame with its top and bottom portions
      being symmetrically arranged rectangular, right pyramid space
      frames. To allow this description to be more meaningful, the
      lengths of the space frame rods will be expressed in relation to
      the length (L) of the rods that make up the upper and lower
      pyramids. For this inner pyramid L is 9″. As seen in FIG. 5, the
      upper, inner pyramid 121 has a base 122 that is formed by four
      rods of length L 128 arranged to represent the sides of a square.
      From each corner 223 224 225 226 of that base is a rod 129
      representing a vertex of the pyramid. The rods' other ends all
      meet near an apex 126. In this case the vertices rods' are also of
      length L. These identical lengths of base and vertex segments
      result in a shape with faces that are at about 52 degrees to the
      plane of the base.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The upper pyramid, 121 as mentioned, is complimented by an
      identical lower pyramid 130 that is of an identical space frame
      configuration. However, in constituting the armature, the lower
      pyramid has its apex 136 pointing downward. Its position is
      symmetric relative to the upper pyramid with the exception of
      being rotated by 45 degrees about a line connecting the two apex
      points 126 136. This rotational offset is better seen in FIG. 6
      that shows a top plan view of the pyramids of FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As seen in FIG. 7 as well as other figures, the two
      pyramids are spaced apart by connecting rods 131 that interconnect
      the corners of the upper pyramid's base 122 with corners of the
      lower pyramid's base 133. Each corner is connected to the two
      nearest corners of the opposing pyramid's base. For example, a
      particular corner of the upper pyramid 224 has one attached
      connecting rod 131 whose other end is attached to corner 235 of
      the lower pyramid 130. A second connecting rod is attached to the
      same upper pyramid corner 224 and its other end is attached to the
      lower pyramid at a second corner 234. The six remaining connecting
      rods are similarly attached to the pyramids creating the symmetric
      geometric shape of the inner armature. Since the pyramids are
      rotationally offset, these eight equal length rods take a form of
      the letter “V”. In this example, the length of those rods are all
      of length 1.8*L. The consequence to these relative rod dimensions
      is that the height of the pyramids is 0.707*L while the distance
      between bases is 0.95*L. The total length from apex to apex is
      therefore (2*1.8+0.95)*L or 3.1*L. As mentioned, the pyramids'
      respective vertices meet near the apex. In fact, they terminate at
      the upper and lower support tubes 127 137 respectively. These
      support tubes are centered on the armature's apex-to-apex
      centerline.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] FIG. 8 shows an inner armature surrounded by an outer
      armature, both on a common axle through their support tubes. In
      this version, the outer armature has rods making up its pyramids
      that are length 11 inches. Bearings support the armatures for
      rotating on the axle. They provide for independent driving of each
      armature in their respective rotations. The total height of the
      dual armature assembly is about 36 inches from apex to apex.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0039] Assembly Method</b><br>
      <br>
      [0040] The various rods and pipes that make up most parts of the
      armatures are welded together in this first example. Since one is
      completely inside of the other, the outer armature is welded
      together after being assembled around the inner armature. FIG. 9
      shows a partially assembled unit. The outer upper and lower
      pyramids are in place surrounding the inner armature. The next
      step would be to weld the outer armature's connecting rods to the
      appropriate corner locations on the two large pyramids.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0041] Variations</b><br>
      <br>
      [0042] While a solar powered unit may be ideal for field use,
      motors running on AC mains power might be more suitable for use in
      a green house or in an indoor hydroponic application. Rather than
      having a motor for each armature, it is known to those skilled in
      the art to use a single motor with gearing or other mechanical
      coupling to have one motive source turn the armatures in opposite
      directions. The entire unit may be scaled up or scaled down,
      keeping the proportions constant.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Second Example Embodiment</b><br>
      <br>
      [0043] A similar geometric shape to the first example unit is
      present in the second example embodiment. However, the second
      embodiment is intended for indoor use. The armatures rods are each
      one half the total length of the corresponding structure in the
      first example. This version is shown in FIG. 10. Rather than a
      platform and pipes to support it, this unit is in a self-contained
      cabinet.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0044] Operation</b><br>
      <br>
      [0045] For outdoor operation the embodiment of example one can be
      supported from the ground by 2-inch galvanized pipes approximately
      one foot into the ground that support the platform near its four
      corners. The unit is placed in a field in proximity to the crops
      to be effected. The solar panel is connected to a battery that, in
      turn, is connected to a timer and to speed controllers for the two
      motors. The timers are recommended to be set to operate the
      apparatus three to five times during daylight hours at equally
      spaced intervals for equal durations. An example operation is
      operating for five minutes, three times a day, at intervals that
      split the daylight hours into four segments. Since the sunlight
      available is variable, those skilled in the art will recognize the
      function of the battery in providing a steady source of energy to
      rotate the armatures at a predetermined rate for a predetermined
      duration. The rate for each armature respectively can be between
      400 and 500 revolutions per minute.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0046] Alternate Modes of Operation</b><br>
      <br>
      [0047] A smaller, indoor unit is bolted to the floor the plants
      are resting upon. Alternatively it is bolted to a wall that is, in
      turn, abutting and secured to that floor. An indoor unit would
      most likely be powered from AC, as mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] AC could also power an outdoor unit. Other modes of
      powering could be a wind turbine substituting for the solar
      panels. Another could involve deriving power from the flow of
      water in an irrigation system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0049] Experiments to-Date</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0050] Outdoors Experiment</b><br>
      <br>
      [0051] Two primary experiments have been performed. A large-scale
      outdoor trial was performed at Eclipse Farms in the City of
      Oxnard, Calif. The crop grown there is Roma tomatoes. A unit 600
      constructed as the first example embodiment was installed and
      operated as discussed in the operation section above in a 35-acre
      rectangular field 500. Within the field a square of 10 acres 700
      (660 feet per side) had a unit placed at its center. Plant
      locations were marked off along lines due North, East, South and
      West from the center location to the perimeter of the square. The
      unit was activated on Jul. 20, 2009 and controlled by the inventor
      during the testing.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In FIG. 12 the location of five plants per line were marked
      as plants to be measured in the experiment. Starting from the unit
      (in each respective compass point direction) the distances from
      the center were 50 feet, 100 feet, 175 feet, 225 and 330 feet. In
      addition there were four other plants marked for testing. These
      four plants were along the same four lines at the four points at
      which respective line intersects the acre plot perimeter. In FIG.
      11 these points are designated A, B, C and D. The 20 plant
      locations within the square are designated in FIG. 12. The five
      “West” plant locations are designated W1, W2, W3, W4 and W5. The
      “East” plant locations are designated E1, E2, E3, E4, and E5 and
      so on for the North and the South.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The twenty-four marked test plants were measured for over
      fourteen weeks. Those measurements included counting the tomatoes
      each week. In addition, in the first few weeks, both the number of
      flowers and the number of tomatoes were counted twice a week.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0054] Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0055] The number of tomatoes in the twenty locations on the E-W
      and N-S lines within the 10 acres is shown in FIG. 13 as a line
      graph. That figure shows the N 301, S 302, E 303 and W 304 tomato
      counts as a function of feet from the unit. Also seen is a curve
      representing the average 305. This graph demonstrates a fall off
      of the effect of the unit with distance which is consistent with
      many physical phenomena. The same data is displayed in a
      three-dimensional format in FIG. 14. The X and Y positions
      represent the plants' location relative to the unit. The Z heights
      represent the number of tomatoes on the plant at that location
      when counted at the end of the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] It can be seen that in all directions there is a general
      falling off of tomato count as distance from the unit increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The other four tomatoes were not at constant distances from
      the unit since the overall field is rectangular. A and C are at
      460 feet, B is at 270 feet, D is at 20 feet. Those data points are
      also included in the graph of FIG. 13.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0058] Indoors Experiment</b><br>
      <br>
      [0059] A second set of experiments were performed indoors. In fact
      it was on a balcony of an apartment in Marina Del Rey, Calif.
      These experiments were performed during 2008. The tests used
      different plants including Celosia, Tomatoes, and Pepper plants.
      The plants were sourced in twos from a nearby Home Depot. Plants
      of similar height and girth were chosen. If one was arguable
      slightly larger than the other, that one was made the control
      plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The procedure was that the potted plants were placed a few
      inches apart on a table on the balcony. Lab calibrated beakers
      were obtained and used to measure water and nutrients that were
      applied equally to both plants. Every week the plants positions
      were changed to account for any difference in sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Each day the test plant was taken to another room inside
      where a Biowave unit was bolted to the wall. The motors of this
      machine were set a yard away from the machine itself (to be
      further from the plant) so that any magnetic field from the motors
      would not impact on the plants. Also the motors were screened with
      expanded metal and grounded to further reduce any EM radiation.
      This was measured with a magnetometer.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The test plant was placed beside the machine for 15 minutes
      a day and then returned to the balcony. In one test run the test
      plant had 15 blossoms, while the control plant had 7 blossoms.
      This experiment was repeated at least 18 times during 2008 with
      both with of the other plants. All of the tests showed the test
      plants with greater growth than the control plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Four of the 18 tests were with organic tomatoes. In all
      these cases the test plant to control plant tomato-count ratio
      ranged from 4 times to 2. The results of one particular test run
      are shown in FIG. 15. The more densely hatched columns represent
      the number of tomatoes on the test plant. The other columns
      represent the control plant. Both are plotted at one week
      intervals over seven weeks. Additionally, in at least one
      documented test run, the test plant also had significantly less
      insect damage than the control plant.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] A tomato from one of the experiment's test plants was
      analyzed for its Brix content by Silliker Labs of Cypress Calif.
      The USDA average Brix rating for an organic tomato is 4.9%. The
      tests performed by this independent lab showed the test tomatoes
      to have a Brix rating of 10.5%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0065] Theory of Operation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0066] No particular theory of operation is presented or known.
      Various known mechanisms may be involved including acoustic waves
      transmitted through the air or vibrations transmitted through the
      ground. Gravity is another possible communication medium. The
      papers mentioned in the background section, “Biochemical and
      physiological changes in plants as a result of different sonic
      exposures” by Yu-Chuan Qin, Won-Chu Lee, Young-Cheol Choi and
      Tae-Wan Kim and “Growth Promotion by Vibration at 50 Hz in Rice
      and Cucumber Seedlings”, by Hideyuki Takahashi, Hiroshi Suge and
      Tadashi Kato. (Plant CellPhysiol. 32(5): 729-732 (1991)). These
      and other publications evidence serious researchers studying
      possibly not-yet-understood factors that can affect plant health
      and growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Publications that teach subtle influences on plant growth
      include, “Plant gene responses to frequency-specific sound
      signals” Mi-Jeong Jeong, Chang-Ki Shim, Jin-Ohk Lee, Hawk-Bin
      Kwon, Yang-Han Kim, Seong-Kon Lee, Myeong-Ok Byun and Soo-Chul
      Park., “Growth of the Cellular Slime Mold, Dictyostelium
      discoideum, Is Gravity Dependent” Yukishige Kawasaki*, Takeshi
      Kiryul, Kenji Usui1, and Hiroshi Mizutani, Mitsubishi-Kasei
      Institute of Life Sciences, 11 Minamiooya, Machida, Tokyo 194,
      Japan. Another paper showing an effect of music and even less
      tangible inputs causing differences in plant growth is “Measuring
      Effects of Music, Noise, and Healing Energy Using a Seed
      Germination Bioassay” From the journal of alternative and
      complementary medicine Volume 10, number 1, 2004, pp. 113-122
      Katherine Creath, Ph.D. (Optical Science), Ph.D. (Music), 1-3 And
      Gary E. Schwartz, Ph.D.1, 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Still other scholarly papers that may be relevant are from
      Plant and Cell Physiology, 2002, Vol. 43, No. 6 647-651. “Effects
      of Mechanical Vibration on Seed Germination of Arabidopsis
      thaliana” (L.) Heynh. Ayuho Uchida1, 3 and Kotaro T. Yamamoto1, 2,
      4. and 1. J Gravit Physiol. 1996 April; 3(1):69-74. Also, “Gravity
      related features of plant growth behavior studied with rotating
      machines”. Brown A H. Collaborators: Brown A H. University of
      Pennsylvania (Philadelphia), USA.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Those skilled in the art will recognize that these and
      other teachings suggest that occurrences proximate to plants may
      have effects on their growth even though the mechanisms may not be
      understood. They represent serious researcher's efforts to
      understand subtle influences on plant germination and growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] These seven papers mentioned above are hereby incorporated
      by reference in their entirety. In particular, FIGS. 2A and 2B are
      reproductions of charts appearing in the paper “Biochemical and
      physiological changes in plants as a result of different sonic
      exposures” mentioned above. FIG. 2A shows polyamine content
      (nmol/gFW) of cucumber seedlings. FIG. 2B shows a mature plant
      with a different acoustic treatment. Error bars represent the
      standard deviations of the means of polyamine contents. It can be
      seen from these figures that the polyamine uptake is greatest in
      the plants exposed to ultrasound.<br>
