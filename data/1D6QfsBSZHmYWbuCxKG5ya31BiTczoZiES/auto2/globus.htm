      <p>DETROIT- When Alfred Globus discovered a new way to clean up
        offshore oil spills in the mid-1960s, that was something. </p>
      <p>Globus, president of United International Research Inc., was in
        Detroit this week to talk about "HydroFuel," a mixture
        consisting of 87 per cent low-octane gasoline, 10 per cent water
        and-here's the key-three per cent Hydrelate. </p>
      <p>Globus refused to be specific about what Hydrelate is or how it
        works. He would say only that it is a non-petroleum-based
        chemical that not only acts as a catalyst in the blending of
        gasoline and water, but raises octane levels as well. </p>
      <p>Fuel economy for the mixture was "virtually the same" as the
        14.3 miles per gallon the vehicle gets using regular gas, he
        said. Ac-cording to Globus, about five gallons of regular
        gasoline were saved using the mixture, while total fuel costs
        fell about five per cent. Globus said he starts with 72-octane
        unleaded fuel, and that the edition of Hydrelate and water
        boosts the octane level to about 91 roughly the same as today's
        low-lead fuels. </p>
      <p>In two years of laboratory and field testing, there has been no
        evidence that engines are harmed by HydroFuel, Globus said. </p>

      <p><b>Dr Alfred R. Globus</b> - working for United International
        Research developed a Hydro-fuel mixture around the

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A stabilized composition of matter
        comprising a fuel oil, such as gasoline, ethanol, small amounts
        of water and a stabilizing amount of an additive which is
        substantially insoluble in water, but which is soluble in ethyl
        alcohol and gasoline and is effective to prevent the separation
        of the gasoline-ethyl alcohol solution into two distinct phases;
        said additive being n-hexylalcohol, hereinafter, n-hexanol. The
        invention also includes a method for stabilizing gasoline, that
        is, for preventing or retarding the phase separation of
        gasoline-ethanol mixtures in the presence of small amounts of
        water, and this being the case when the temperature of the
        gasoline-ethanol mixture has been reduced to below 20 DEG F. </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the stabilization of gasoline which
        has been diluted with ethanol, i.e. stretched with ethanol
        containing 3-4% water and which solutions are subject to
        separation. </p>
      <p>In view of the relative shortage and high cost of gasoline, it
        is desirable to provide some method and means which will
        stabilize gasoline-ethyl alcohol mixtures, thereby allowing the
        gasoline-ethyl alcohol mixtures to function at their fullest
        efficiency, i.e., to exist as a single phase and this even when
        the ambient temperatures fall below 20.degree. F. </p>
      <p>In particular, it would be desirable to provide some method and
        means which will stabilize gasoline-ethyl alcohol mixtures,
        wherein the alcohol is ethyl alcohol containing small amounts of
        water, for instance 3-4%, and is present in an amount of 10% or
        more and preferably above 20%, so that the phase separation
        which would normally occur is avoided and the mixture maintained
        as a single phase. </p>
      <p>The use of ethyl alcohol as an extender for gasoline has been
        proposed. However the successful use of ethyl alcohol has been
        limited to those instances where the alcohol has been
        substantially anhydrous. In the presence of even small amounts
        of water, the ethyl alcohol is no longer miscible with gasoline,
        bringing about a separation into two phases, especially when
        there is a drop in ambient temperature. When this occurs, i.e.,
        when the separation into two phases takes place, the bottom
        phase which consists of water and alcohol is corrosive to the
        steel brought into contact therewith and in particular the gas
        tank, pumps, holding tank, etc. </p>
      <p>This invention contemplates the use of ethanol which is not
        anhydrous, but which instead contains 3-4% water. Such alcohol
        is made by simple distillation methods, instead of the expensive
        azeotropic distillation procedures which require more energy and
        the use of costly materials. In addition, the presence of the
        water introduced with the gasoline-ethanol mixture when used for
        example in the conventional engine gives rise to an increased
        octane rating. </p>
      <p>The use of an alcohol to hold ethanol and small amounts of
        water in gasoline solution has already been proposed. Thus it
        has been suggested to use alcohols such as i-propanol and
        i-butanol because they are miscible both with water and
        gasoline. </p>
      <p>The applicant has now found that the use of an alcohol such as
        n-hexanol, which is substantially insoluble in water but which
        is instead soluble in both gasoline and ethanol has numerous
        advantages in forming a stable liquid and preventing separation
        of the gasoline and alcohol. The hexanol is 1-hexanol i.e., the
        straight chain alcohol, since it has been found that branching
        materially reduces the effectiveness of this alcohol as a
        stabilizer, the reduction in effectiveness bearing a direct
        relationship to the amount of branching present. </p>
      <p>It is an object of this invention to provide compositions
        comprising a fuel oil, i.e., gasoline and ethanol which
        compositions are stable against separation into more than one
        phase and that in the presence of small amounts of water and
        that particularly in the event of a drop in ambient temperature.
      </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide a method for
        preventing or retarding the separation into more than one phase
        of gasoline-ethanol solutions in the presence of small amounts
        of water. </p>
      <p>It is still another object of this invention to provide
        compositions of matter comprising a high grade fuel oil i.e.
        gasoline, ethanol and a stabilizing agent therefore. </p>
      <p>It is a further object of this invention to provide an additive
        especially adapted for stabilizing gasoline, particularly
        mixtures of gasoline and ethanol in the presence of small
        amounts of water comprising n-hexanol per se or in the form of
        its solution in the gasoline and/or ethanol. The n-hexanol
        serves to "couple" the ethanol to the gasoline, forming a stable
        liquid and preventing separation even in the presence of small
        amounts of water. </p>
      <p>These and other objects and advantages will become more
        apparent as the description thereof proceeds. </p>
      <p>In accordance with this invention, the above objects and
        advantages are accomplished by the addition to a fuel oil i.e.
        gasoline-ethanol solution containing small amounts of water of a
        stabilizing amount of an additive which is both alcohol and
        gasoline miscible and/or soluble and is effective to prevent the
        separation of the gasoline-ethanol solution into two distinct
        phases and namely by using as additive n-hexanol. It is possible
        in accordance with the invention to employ a mixture of
        n-hexanol with its isomers such as methyl pentanol, ethyl
        butanol or the like, but as noted above such mixtures have not
        been found to be as effective as n-hexanol. Therefore, if
        n-hexanol is not readily available for the purposes of the
        invention, it has been found satisfactory to employ n-hexanol
        and the mixed isomers thereof, as for example produced in the
        oxo-process. The n-hexanol and/or isomers thereof act to couple
        the alcohol to the gasoline effectively stabilizing the mixture
        so that the phase separation which would normally occur when
        even trace amounts of water are present is avoided. </p>
      <p>The stabilizing additive in accordance with the invention, in
        addition to being miscible with both the ethanol and gasoline
        phases is also relatively volatile and boils and evaporates in
        approximately the same range as gasoline, i.e., the stabilizing
        additive has a flash point below about 145.degree. F. </p>
      <p>The additive in accordance with the invention, as noted above
        is preferably n-hexanol or a mixture thereof with its isomers.
        However it has been found that the efficiency of this
        stabilizing additive can be increased if there is included
        therein a dispersing agent which is itself sufficiently volatile
        to meet the requirements of a combustion engine. Such a
        dispersant is 3,5-dimethl-1-hexyn-3-ol. </p>
      <p>3.5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-3-ol is a clear colorless volatile liquid
        having a boiling point of 150.degree.-151.degree. C. Other
        surfactants similar to the 3,5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-3-ol can be
        employed, as for instance the Surfynol products (manufactured by
        Air Products). Such products must be unsaturated and must
        constitute volatile surface active agents that eventually
        evaporate from the system containing them, so as to leave no
        residue to clog the engine or otherwise interfere with its
        functioning. </p>
      <p>The quantity of surfactant utilized amounts to 3-7% preferably
        3-5% referred to the stabilizer. </p>
      <p>In accordance with another aspect of the invention, in order to
        reduce any tendency of the water present in the gasoline-ethanol
        mixture, to bring about corrosion of the steel, it has been
        found expedient to add a volatile amine and more specifically an
        alcohol amine, most preferably a glycol amine which is volatile
        under the conditions of use. One example of a preferred amine
        for use herein is diglycol amine. Another particularly effective
        amine is n-butyl amine. If n-butyl amine is employed, then the
        effectiveness thereof can be further increased by the addition
        of a small amount of 2-pentanone (methylpropylketone). The
        pentanone serves to prevent the separation of n-butyl amine from
        the hexanol. (This is to a great extent due to their overlapping
        boiling points.) The selection of the amine is in part
        determined by its flash point which must be sufficiently high
        that it does not increase the flash point of the
        gasoline-ethanol-stabilizer-surfactant mixture. Preferably a
        boiling point of about 135-145.degree. F. is to be strived for.
        All of the components of the composition as noted are volatile
        and in use leave no residue in the engine. </p>
      <p>According to this invention, stabilizing of the mixture of
        gasoline and ethanol containing small amounts of water is
        achieved by the addition of small quantities of the stabilizing
        additive n-hexanol or its mixture with one or more of its
        isomers per se or together with the non-ionic surfactant and/or
        alcohol amine. The additive employed to effect the stabilization
        may be added to the gasoline-ethanol mixture or to the gasoline
        or the ethanol prior to forming the mixture. It is preferred
        however to add the stabilizing additive to the
        gasoline-ethanol-water mixture. </p>
      <p>Thus in accordance with the invention it has now been found
        that if about 1-20% of the stabilizing additive is introduced
        into the mixture of gasoline and ethanol containing small
        amounts of water, the mixture exists as a solution or as one
        phase. </p>
      <p>The stabilizer, as pointed out here and above may be added to
        the ethanol or to the gasoline prior to forming the mixture
        thereof or it may be added directly to the gasoline-ethanol
        mixture. The stabilizer is added in amounts on the order of from
        about 1-20% and preferably 3-10% based on the mixture of
        gasoline and ethanol, which amounts have been found to effect a
        substantially complete stabilizing of the gasoline-ethanol
        mixtures with which the invention is concerned. Preferred ranges
        of the stabilizer to be added to the gasoline-ethanol-water
        mixture range from about 3% to about 12%. </p>
      <p>The surfactant and the amine are added directly to the
        stabilizer, the surfactant in an amount of 3-7% referred to the
        stabilizer and the amine in approximately like amounts. </p>
      <p>The resultant mixture burns clearly without free carbon (soot)
        and ignites easily in combustion engines. </p>
      <p>Using 194 proof ethanol and gasoline (10:90), separation takes
        place at 30-32.degree. F. If n-hexanol is added in an amount of
        one part per hundred parts of mixture, no separation takes place
        until the temperature has fallen to below -25.degree. F. If the
        mixture includes the surfactant, separation does not take place
        until the temperature has fallen to below -40.degree. F. </p>
      <p>Using 190 proof ethanol and gasoline (10:90) and 21/2% either
        of hexanol, tertiary butanol or isobutyl alcohol, the
        anticipated separation takes place as follows: </p>
      <p>tertiary butyl alcohol: +55.degree. F. <br>
        isobutyl alcohol: +24.degree. F. <br>
        hexanol: -2.degree. F. </p>
      <p>The following examples are set forth for purposes of
        illustration and are not to be construed as limitations of the
        present invention except as set forth in the appended claims. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 1</b> </p>
      <p>9 parts of 194 proof ethanol and 90 parts of gasoline (regular
        unleaded) were mixed together. T this mixture there was added 1
        part of a stabilizer having the following composition: </p>
      <p>90%: n-hexanol <br>
        7%: surfynol (3,5-dimethyl-1-hexyn-3-ol) <br>
        3%: diglycol amine </p>
      <p>No separation of the mixture took place even when the ambient
        temperature dropped to about -30.degree. F. When 2% of the above
        mixture was added separation did not take place until the
        temperature had reached -65.degree. F. </p>
      <p>When isobutyl alcohol was substituted for the n-hexanol,
        separation was observed at 25-27.degree. F. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 2</b> </p>
      <p>1.5% of n-hexanol was added to 13.5% 193 proof ethanol and this
        combination added to 85% of gasoline (regular unleaded). </p>
      <p>No separation was observed to occur even when the temperature
        had fallen to below -20.degree. F. </p>
      <p>The addition of the stabilizer, n-hexanol in this case is
        particularly preferred, since the specific gravity of n-hexanol
        is similar to that of the ethanol facilitating the further
        processing. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 3</b> </p>
      <p>1.5% of a stabilizing additive having the following
        composition: <br>
        90%: n-hexanol <br>
        8%: n-butylamine <br>
        2%: 2-pentanone </p>
      <p>were added to an ethanol-gasoline mixture of the following
        composition: </p>
      <p>13.5%: ethanol (194 proof) <br>
        85%: gasoline (leaded or unleaded) </p>
      <p>No separation was observed even when the ambient temperature
        was dropped to below -20.degree. F. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE 4</b> </p>
      <p>Example 3 was repeated with identical results using as the
        stabilizer the following composition: </p>
      <p>85%: n-hexanol <br>
        12%: n-butylamine <br>
        3%: 2-pentanone </p>
