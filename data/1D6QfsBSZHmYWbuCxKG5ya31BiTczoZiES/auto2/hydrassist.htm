              Mileage</font></b><b><br>
            by</b><b> Linda Russell, KY3 News</b><br>
          ( June 6, 2008 )</p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;BUFFALO, Mo. -- A local man's gadget may help people get
        more miles per gallon of gasoline in their vehicles. Ed Hula is
        a football coach in Buffalo, and a former science teacher. </p>
      <p>A lot of people use their garage to fix a car that has a
        problem. Hula has been working in his garage to try to help fix
        a worldwide problem: the energy crisis. </p>
      <p>“We've got to do something to help one another out, because the
        middle and lower class people are really feeling the bite of the
        gas prices right now,” said Hula. </p>
      <p>So, after a trial and error, and testing a few prototypes on
        his own vehicles, Hula came up with what he calls the
        hydrogen-assist generator. </p>
      <p>“We've got stainless steel plates in here, and when you conduct
        electricity through them stainless steel plates, it takes them
        molecules -- you got two molecules of hydrogen and one oxygen --
        and it takes and separates them into gas,” he said. </p>
      <p>Hula says burning the gas created through this process, called
        electrolysis, can give your car better gas mileage. He's started
        a business and hooked up his generator to about 30 vehicles so
        far. </p>
      <p>His customers have reported between 28 percent and 72 percent
        better gas mileage. Jim Lister is a former mechanic who stands
        behind Hula's generator. </p>
      <p>“I've only had mine on about 100 miles, but I just checked the
        gas mileage this morning and I got 5.1 miles per gallon better
        than what I was, plus I have more power,” said Lister. </p>
      <p>Hula knows he's not the first to think of hydrogen power for
        cars. </p>
      <p>“I'm telling people, if they want one of these units, to buy
        one from me first, copy it, and make your own,” he said. </p>
      <p>Rick Hughlett, owner of Rick's Automotive in Springfield, says
        the hydrogen-assist generator could work, but the additional
        gases in the system could confuse a vehicle's oxygen sensor and
        make the car use more gas. </p>
      <p>“That oxygen sensor is always trying to find 14.7-to-1 air/fuel
        ratio,” said Hughlett. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen is highly flammable but Hula says his generator is
        just as safe or safer than the gas in your car. </p>
      <p>“You can unscrew the lid and drink that water if you want to,”
        he said. </p>
      <p>Hughlett says a backfire or putting it in the wrong spot could
        cause the container to explode. </p>
      <p>“Any time you're installing something under the hood of a car,
        you need to consult a professional,” he said. </p>
      <p>Still, Hughlett believes the inventor is on the right track. </p>
      <p>“The principle, the idea, is good, and we do need these back
        yard inventors, because that may be the one that solves the
        energy crisis. But step lightly,” said Hughlett. </p>
      <p>“I think everybody in America ought to have one!” said Lister.
      </p>
      <p>Hula is selling his hydrogen-assist generators for $600.

      </center>
      <p>"I'm getting 100 miles to the ounce on water," inventor Anthony
        Brown said. </p>
      <p>Brown said he shut his fuel injection system down and created
        the system that can use any type of water with a small amount of
        gas. He said the car is getting just fuel vapor. </p>
      <p>"When you separate the water from the oxygen from the hydrogen,
        it cooks and it cooks down to a brown," Brown said. "We're not
        having any waste product off of it. Everything is consumed and
        burned." </p>
      <p>Local 6 showed video of Brown filling up his vehicle with water
        and then driving around. </p>
      <p>Brown said any profit he makes from his invention will go
        toward helping missionaries around the world. </p>
      <p>"I've just been asking for a way, for the Lord to show me to
        raise money rapidly and I started to working on this idea,"
        Brown said. </p>

          <b>Times Staff Writer</b> </p>
        <p>Wednesday, June 4, 2008</p>
      </center>
      <p>ST. PETERSBURG — Dave Hansen thinks he has found a way to cut
        the cost of gas in half. </p>
      <p>In fact, he said his month-old idea prompted a Tampa Bay
        investor to offer him a seven-figure advance for the rights of
        his invention. But Hansen turned that offer down. </p>
      <p>He said his new hydrogen-supplemental fuel system is not about
        fame or fortune, though it doubles a vehicle's mileage per
        gallon. It's about fishing. </p>
      <p>"After paying about 500 to 600 bucks to catch four or five
        trout, I thought there has to be a better way," said the
        47-year-old retired business owner who is now a computer
        consultant. "My motivation was to go fishing and save money." </p>
      <p>The rising cost of fueling his 24-foot Shamrock fishing boat
        had become a snag, and it didn't help that his main automobile
        for towing his boat was a gas-guzzling 1997 GMC Yukon. </p>
      <p>Hansen did some research on alternative ways of powering
        vehicle engines and found hydrogen to be an often attempted but
        not so successful method. </p>
      <p>That's when he started testing how hydrogen would work in his
        Yukon. After buying $600 worth of parts for engine modifications
        and a month's worth of time, he says the Yukon has gone from 8
        miles per gallon in the city and 12.5 on the highway to about 18
        in the city and 26 on the highway. </p>
      <p>"Now, I don't pay $4 a gallon. I pay $2 a gallon," Hansen said.
        "I've got my big truck that I want to keep and I get the same
        mileage that you get with a Toyota Camry." </p>
      <p>He said engines lose 30 to 40 percent of gasoline energy
        through exhaust, but the hydrogen supplement allows his engine
        to burn 100 percent of the gasoline. </p>
      <p>Hansen added a device to the Yukon that creates hydrogen and
        combines it with the oxygen input to the engine, which helps the
        motor maximize gasoline performance. His system requires a small
        amount of distilled water to power the hydrogen generator and
        uses distilled vinegar to keep the generator's plates from
        corroding. </p>
      <p>Additional gauges monitor the efficiency of the generator and
        help the system work well in Florida summer temperatures. </p>
      <p>"The motor now runs cooler and with less carbon buildup, which
        ultimately will increase engine life," Hansen said. "The system
        has multiple built-in safeguards to make sure that the driver
        can operate the vehicle without concern." </p>
      <p>Not everyone is sold on the idea. </p>
      <p>Lev Gelb, an associate professor of chemistry at Washington
        University in St. Louis, who has worked for years on hydrogen
        storage, said he is skeptical of Hansen's claim. </p>
      <p>"The energy in the battery also comes from the engine, so all
        of the energy actually comes from the gasoline," Gelb said. </p>
      <p>"This approach can't work because everything is still limited
        by the car engine efficiency, so I think that his claim of
        nearly doubling the vehicle mileage is bogus." </p>
      <p>Hansen said scientists' and car engineers' doubt is relevant
        but limited by what they have studied. </p>
      <p>"The science is there, but there isn't a focus on existing
        vehicles," Hansen said. "Everyone looks at new vehicles to
        produce hydrogen." </p>
      <p>Albert Rawlins, 75, who recently met Hansen while playing golf,
        said he is willing to try a hydrogen fuel system on his 1995
        Chevrolet Impala, especially because he still sends gas money to
        two daughters living in Ohio. </p>
      <p>"If you don't know computers, the best mechanic in the world
        can't do this," Rawlins said of his amazement of seeing Hansen's
        modified Yukon engine. "I told Dave, 'I'm willing to do this in
        order to make a statement' and the first thing I'm doing is
        taking a road trip to Ohio." </p>
      <p>Even with regular compliments from people like Rawlins, Hansen
        said he still isn't sure he wants to pursue a patent and open a
        business. Instead, he has posted his findings on his Web site,
        htgsystems.com, and he will allow feedback to determine his next
        move. </p>
      <p>"I'll let the public decide. I'm not doing this to make money.
        I just wanted to go fishing, and I thought it was a shame that
        nobody was doing anything about this." </p>

      <p>(KAAL) -- Thanks to one local high school senior's invention,
        we may one day find relief at the pump. </p>
      <p>The Alden Conger senior just received international awards for
        his work. </p>
      <p>It's taken him two years of work, but it's finally here. His
        invention could lower your fuel bills by 30%. </p>
      <p>He built a battery-powered device that can actually turn water
        into energy and lower the amount of gas you need by about 23%. </p>
      <p>"It'll lower emissions, clean up the environment, and it will
        save you money." (soli) </p>
      <p>You may have heard of hydrogen cars. Soli’s invention attaches
        to your motor and uses both hydrogen and oxygen for energy. </p>
      <p>So far, he's only tested his invention on lawn mower engines
        that don't move. He plans to test it on moving engines, and then
        in cars. </p>
      <p>He and four friends re-designed the engine and design of a car
        so it gets 866 miles to the gallon! </p>
      <p>The car isn't safe for the road, but the combination of that
        engine, Soli’s invention, and a safer frame could revolutionize
        the way we drive. </p>
      <p>"I'm feeling great. I didn't know it would get this far. The
        project just seemed to get bigger and bigger," says Soli. </p>
      <p>Within the last month, he won two international awards and
        $2,500 for his work. He says this is only the beginning. </p>

              40-60% mpg Increases</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Michael Couch</b></p>

      <p>The first closely replicated Bob Boyce Style Electrolyzers are
        beginning to report results in the Watercar, Hydroxy, and
        Workingwatercar yahoo egroups.&nbsp; Several replicators have
        reported 40-60% mpg increases with Bob Boyce and Smack Booster
        modified versions of the Bob Boyce System. </p>
      <p>Most of these replications are using "brute force" electrolysis
        meaning that the three frequency toroidal transformers are not
        yet being utilized for maximum gain.&nbsp; One experimenter name
        Houston has reported a steady 21 l/min output from his 49 Cell
        Boyce System using various wiring options and has reported
        40-60% mpg increases. </p>
      <p>Several Smack Booster replicators are reporting similar 40-60%
        increases in their mpg when using the system as a booster to
        their gas fueled engines.&nbsp; These increases require
        adjustments to Oxygen sensors in modern cars to compensate for
        HHO gas utilization.&nbsp; Many systems will regard the extra O
        in the fuel mix as a too lean condition and force more gas fuel
        into the engine which negates the gains from using Hydroxy. </p>
      <p>This scenario accounts for many reports of no gain at all, to
        as little as 10-20% increase in mileage in contrast to the
        40-60% mileage increases reported by several.&nbsp; It seems
        that fuel/air sensors and electronics are the source of the
        variation in performance results.&nbsp; The groups offer
        numerous workarounds for these problems. </p>
      <p>The upshot of all these things, is that the Water Car era seems
        to be upon us.&nbsp; At least the "Do It Yourself"-ers have
        found significant answers for themselves in these groups.&nbsp;
        Businesses are emerging from the forums as DIYers offer
        assistance to one another with various parts of the systems to
        which their particular expertise gives rise.&nbsp; The situation
        is not unlike the early stages of the personal computer
        revolution. </p>
      <p>Thanks to PESN's coverage, inquiries and new group members are
        arriving daily from around the world into these forums.&nbsp;
        Successful replications are being report as often.&nbsp; Though
        a complete Boyce replication with 60-101 cells and three phase
        pulsing has not yet been tested and reported; there are a number
        of people nearing that point. </p>
      <p>By comparison one might liken the current stage as the Computer
        Kit stage with only a couple complete turnkey systems
        available.&nbsp; Lets call it the pre-Apple stage.&nbsp; Good
        thing oil is useful for other things besides production of
        gasoline, otherwise one might want to divest oneself of
        investments in oil even though its current price is $100 a
        barrel.&nbsp; One last push for profits from a (thankfully)
        dying gasoline industry, buggy whips anyone? </p>
      <p>Bob recently revealed in posts to a yahoo watercar egroup that
        his system uses sequence relaxation and phase tweaking to
        control hydroxy production volume.&nbsp; Though the result of
        this looks like frequency shifting to a frequency counter; that
        is only because of the lack of pulses during the relaxation part
        of the wave forms.&nbsp; You might think of it as burst
        frequency modulation instead of frequency modulation. </p>
      <p>The phase tweaking adjusts the relationship of the three
        frequencies to "fine tune".&nbsp; Bob also detailed the method
        of setup for initial tuning after which little adjustment is
        need.&nbsp; Here is the quote... </p>
      <p>My favorite implementation was to use pressure transducer
        output to vary the relaxation delay between pulse string
        sequences. If looked at on a frequency counter, it would look as
        though the frequencies of all 3 channels were being changed, but
        that is only because a frequency counter counts pulses over a
        set period of time. The pulse streams out of a HexController has
        series of pulses that are in fixed relation to one another with
        fixed intervals. Once a cell stack is tuned to "frequency",
        which is actually a specific pulse train timing, that timing
        changes very little, and only in response to electrolyte
        density. </p>
      <p>The pulse durations are hardly ever changed once they are
        locked onto optimum for a given cell stack system. </p>
      <p>The timing of each series of pulse sequences results in
        predefined sets of pulse intervals within each sequence, and a
        delay between sequences. These relaxation times can be adjusted
        slightly to vary production. This is MUCH more effective at
        varying production than varying pulse width without wasting
        power. So we can look at it as slight variations in phase
        between the individual phases within a pulse sequence, which I
        called "twist", and larger opportunities of missing pulse time
        (relaxation time) between pulse sequence sets. </p>
      <p>I hope I'm not confusing anyone here, please try to bear with
        me. i am not always very good at explaining things in ways that
        everyone can understand. </p>
      <p>Frequency is set by not having any phase shift (twist) or
        sequence delays (relaxation time) set, and tuning the unit
        timing for maximum production at the least power consumption.
        After timing is set, then the sensors can be brought online. The
        temperature sensor provides feedback to adjust pulse timing (not
        pulse duration) slightly. This can compensate for density
        changes in the electrolyte. </p>
      <p>With any given jump in pulse timing due to temperature
        compensation, we can fine tune operation for that given timing
        by adjusting the phase twist slightly. So we really want to
        leave that variable alone, and use it solely as a means of "fine
        tuning" for operational changes due to temperature and
        electrolyte conductivity. </p>
      <p>Relaxation time between pulse sequences can be adjusted to
        control volume of hydroxy gas production on the fly. This can
        use pressure, flow, and demand (throttle position) all as inputs
        to determine optimum hydroxy gas production levels. </p>
      <p>I should also add... Anyone looking at a frequency counter
        would mistakenly assume that frequency is changing while
        adjusting the relaxation time, when really what is changing is
        the space between sequences, and to a much lesser degree the
        phase relationship between the 3 channels. (Ref.) </p>

      <p>Turning to Water to Save Fuel </p>
      <p>Franky Chahyadi's motorbike used to travel between 30 and 35
        kilometers on one liter of premium fuel. But since he started
        using an electrolyzer, a liter of premium fuel can keep his
        motorbike going for 50 to 55 kilometers. And it's not just his
        motorbike; his Mercedes C18 is also performing more
        economically. </p>
      <p>Before, a liter of fuel was just enough to travel five
        kilometers, but with an electrolyzer, his Mercedes travels nine.
        In 2006, after undertaking numerous tests, Joko found a simple
        way to separate the hydrogen and oxygen in water and channel the
        hydrogen to the engine. This can save between 70 and 100 percent
        of fuel used in motor vehicles. </p>
      <p>The shape of the device is quite simple. A coil is wrapped
        around a plastic soy sauce bottle and is used to transmit an
        electric current beneath the bottle. The coil is connected to
        the battery. A pipe is attached to the top of the bottle to
        connect the engine to the carburetor. </p>
      <p>"When the engine is running, it will automatically produce
        hydrogen and this causes an explosion in the engine," Joko said.
        "The chemical formula for water is H2O. If this is subjected to
        an electric current, it will produce H2 and O2," Joko said. </p>
      <p>About five seconds after the electric current, gas bubbles out
        of the water. After the gas has been channeled to the trial
        engine, it explodes and can drive the crankshaft five meters or
        more. </p>
      <p>"This is just from using one piston. If we use three pistons to
        drive the crankshaft, it can break," Joko said. He chose a
        transparent soy sauce bottle because it was cheap, easy to find
        and safe. </p>
      <p>"The transparency can help us check the water's condition and
        whether or not it is still clear," Joko said. </p>
      <p>In order to produce good hydrogen, the water should be neutral
        or rainwater, and it only needs to be changed once a month. The
        use of tap water can cause problems because it includes other
        substances that inhibit the production of hydrogen. Joko
        installed the electrolyzer in his car. Joko said burning
        hydrogen was good and its octane rating reached 130. This
        compares with the rating of premium fuel, which is only in the
        80s, and Pertamax, with a rating of 94. With the electrolyzer,
        the burning of fuel is more efficient and the power of the
        engine is stronger, he said. He said the more efficient burning
        decreases carbon emissions. Oil use also becomes more
        economical. It is cleaner because it partly emits water in place
        of carbon. </p>
      <p>"Consequently, water will always come out of vehicles with
        electrolyzers. When the engine is used for the first time in the
        morning, the system expels water," Joko said. </p>
      <p>To replace the raw materials used for installation in a
        motorcycle, the customer is charged Rp 75,000 (US$8) for
        motorbikes and Rp 150,000 for cars. </p>
      <p>"This is not about profit. The money being charged is only used
        to buy the components," said Joko, adding more than 1,000
        vehicles have used his invention. </p>
      <p>Since he has no commercial interest, Joko said he did not want
        to patent his invention. He hopes people will make the device
        themselves since its construction is simple and the materials
        easy to find. Joko is further innovating in trying to develop an
        engine that uses water as its fuel. He has changed the working
        mechanisms of a lawn mower engine so the machine can only use
        exploding hydrogen and not fuel. </p>
      <p>"Using 10 soy sauce bottles each containing 0.5 liters of
        water, the lawn mower engine keeps running," he said. "I want to
        try this on my motorcycle just using water." </p>
      <p>Joko believes the fuel crisis will be solved with the creation
        of a water-powered engine. </p>

              Use</font></b> </p>

        <p><b>Federico D. Pascual Jr.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>HERE we go again! </p>
      <p>We finally saw again inventor Daniel D. Dingel after about a
        year of having sort of drifted away from each other. He was at
        the ABS-CBN trying to win converts to his hydrocar that,
        according to his fantastic claim, runs on nothing but water! </p>
      <p>Dingel was being interviewed in the "Bantay Kalikasan" program
        over DZMM by media environmentalist Bong Faustino together with
        Rudy Lantano, who was discussing on phone patch his concoction
        of gasoline mixed with alcohol to make it cheaper and
        environment-friendly. </p>
      <p>With the way Dingel and his troupe reacted when I walked into
        the DZMM booth, I doubt if he had any inkling that he was to see
        my shadow again that day -- particularly at a time when he is
        making a sales pitch. </p>
      <p>Without telling him, Bong invited me to sit with Dingel, I
        sensed, to balance his presentation. </p>
      <p>WITH the previous program "Jeepney ni Erap" anchored by Korina
        Sanchez having eaten into Bong’s time slot and with his loads of
        ads to shoot down the listener’s ear, I lost no time in driving
        home my main point. </p>
      <p>Sitting across the desk from Dingel, I reiterated my old
        challenge to him: If it is true that his car runs on nothing but
        water, let’s prove it to the whole world by driving it in a
        supervised 1,000-kilometer demonstration cruise up and down the
        South Luzon Expressway, from Magallanes to Calamba and back. </p>
      <p>I made this suggestion last year, because of lingering
        suspicion that Dingel’s red Toyota Corolla (UGA 222) still
        secretly uses gasoline aside from his electrolysis gadget that
        produces hydrogen gas to feed into his engine. </p>
      <p>Even granting it has a secret gas tank, the gasoline (or
        whatever extra fuel it is) would run out in 1,000 kilometers and
        reduce the car to exclusive dependence on the water fuel used by
        Dingel’s invention. </p>
      <p>SUCH suspicion of a secret extra fuel is not without basis. At
        some demonstrations, some engineers checked the exhaust and
        sniffed the smoke coming out. It smelled of gasoline fumes! </p>
      <p>At the Department of Science and Technology, scientists went
        beyond their noses and actually subjected the emission to
        scientific tests. They reported traces of carbon oxides, the
        type one would find in burned gasoline. </p>
      <p>Water is two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen, nothing more,
        nothing less. Where did the carbon oxides (oxidized or burned
        carbon) come from? </p>
      <p>To cut short the endless debate about a secret gas tank, we
        asked Dingel last year, and we repeated the suggested yesterday
        on the air, that we take the car on a 1,000-km run, continuously
        feeding it nothing but water. </p>
      <p>DINGEL refused, worrying aloud about the monumental security
        problem involved in having him and the monitors driving up and
        down the expressway exposed to the world. </p>
      <p>Maybe he had a point. Although he is thousands of miles from
        Sulu, who knows the naughty Abu Sayyaf might just plant a land
        mind in his tracks nga naman! Or some Lost Command might hijack
        him and his precious invention! </p>
      <p>At that point I was hoping the gods of ABS-CBN would come
        rushing through the door to assure Dingel that if he would agree
        to such a road test, they would guarantee his safety and that of
        his invention. </p>
      <p>IF I owned ABS-CBN, I would make such an offer to settle the
        issue once and for all. </p>
      <p>Imagine the media scoop, the spectacle: Dingel’s red hydrocar
        cruising down the expressway accompanied by a mean-looking
        security phalanx and the network’s Radyo Patrol reporting live a
        kilometer-per-kilometer report on the progress of the road test.
      </p>
      <p>President Estrada, besieged as he is with price issues, would
        do well to order the presidential security unit to help protect
        the car that might yet free us from the clutches of the oil
        cartel. During the run, it won’t hurt if Press Secretary Dong
        Puno, an ABS-CBN alumnus, slips in a Dingel paragraph or two in
        his news briefing. </p>
      <p>The other media won’t be able to ignore the event. Advertisers
        would scramble to get into the bandwagon. Mother Lily might sign
        a contract for exclusive rights to the life story of Dingel. The
        possibilities are endless! </p>
      <p>BUT Bong Faustino does not own ABS-CBN and could not commit,
        right then and there, the attention and the resources of the
        giant network. So Dingel got away, again, with that lame excuse
        of lack of security. </p>
      <p>The truth is that Dingel never looked like he had a security
        problem. During those times when he would still talk to me
        because I was writing about him and his gadget, we would meet at
        the McDonald’s at BF Homes in Parañaque and chat endlessly while
        his car is parked blatantly in front of the burgerhouse. </p>
      <p>On some occasions, we would even leave his car in the McDo
        parking lot and use my van to go some place. We had no guard for
        the car or for his person. Nobody touched his Corolla. </p>
      <p>The car is an easy target, even for amateurs. It has markings
        all over its body announcing that it is Dingel’s water-powered
        car. </p>
      <p>When I saw the car again yesterday at ABS-CBN, it was still the
        same demo unit. And Dingel was still the same salesman with the
        same spiel about fantastic dollar offers from some foreign
        entities scrambling to get first crack at his revolutionary
        invention. </p>
      <p>ASIDE from one ever faithful sidekick whose name I cannot now
        recall, there is now a small coterie of new converts who look
        like businessmen smelling of snake oil. </p>
      <p>While Dingel was demonstrating his hydrogen-loaded popgun
        shooting a canister with a loud bang into the air, one of his
        new devotees told us that their group has convinced somebody in
        Malacañang, somebody surnamed De Guzman, to have the armed
        forces adopt the Dingel invention into their motor vehicles and
        navy craft. </p>
      <p>As a taxpayer, I should have butted in with "Teka muna!" -- but
        what the heck. If our countrymen cannot have peace, jobs and
        food, they can use some entertainment. </p>
      <p>WHILE Dingel was demonstrating his hydrogen popgun in the
        ABS-CBN parking lot, this businessman who told me about the
        armed forces deal was trying to explain to me how the hydrocar
        works. </p>
      <p>I did not have the heart to tell him that I’ve been there
        before him. But when he kept referring to Dingel’s device as a
        "nuclear reactor," I simply had to react. </p>
      <p>I pointedly told him that the demo car did not have a nuclear
        reactor. I had to explain to him what a nuclear reactor was and
        that Dingel’s contraption did not touch the nuclei of the
        hydrogen and the oxygen taken from the water. </p>
      <p>This is a simple case of electrolysis, I said, the type of
        experiment we did in high school science class. An electric
        current is passed through the water and the water is broken up
        into its hydrogen and oxygen components. </p>
      <p>IN the case of Dingel, he feeds the resulting hydrogen and
        oxygen into the combustion chamber of the retooled Toyota
        engine. With the spark plugs triggered, the gaseous mixture
        explodes, sending the pistons moving and the shafts turning as
        in a conventional car. </p>
      <p>The difference is that instead of the vaporized gasoline-air
        mixture in a regular car, Dingel uses hydrogen with traces of
        oxygen. He gets the explosive hydrogen and the combustible
        oxygen directly from the electrolysis done with his device. </p>
      <p>In many similar experiments and inventions in Europe and the
        United States, they first store the hydrogen gas generated and
        feed it into the engine as needed. Dingel pipes it directly from
        the electrolysis process into the engine without storing it
        first. </p>
      <p>ONE of the sources of doubt on the part of DOST scientists is
        Dingel’s using an ordinary 12-volt car battery to initiate and
        continue the process of generating hydrogen gas under the hood.
      </p>
      <p>Dingel displays a certification that he uses only 5 amperes to
        do that, whereas many incredulous engineers say we need more
        than a thousand times that to accomplish the same work. </p>
      <p>They also cite the law of thermodynamics saying in effect that
        we cannot create matter or energy. They cannot accept that
        Dingel, with an input of only 12 volts, can generate an output
        of enormous energy to run a regular combustion engine. How did
        he create that much energy, they ask. </p>
      <p>That’s when they slip in the suggestion that he is probably
        also using gasoline from a secret tank. </p>
      <p>THIS brings us back to our ultimate test: Let’s just run the
        car for 1,000 kms. on nothing but water, stopping briefly every
        100 kilometers to check its vital signs. If there is some other
        fuel secretly being fed into it, as its critics allege, this
        hidden fuel should run out in 1,000 kms. </p>
      <p>The big question is why Dingel is scared of a public test that
        will, theoretically, prove precisely his point that it’s just
        water running his car. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Fuel From Water Becoming Reality Says Kiwi
              Firm</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Imagine watering the garden, then turning the hose into your
        petrol tank and filling up the car. </p>
      <p>It has been a holy grail for an age, a water-based fuel. Well,
        that technology may already be here, claims small Kiwi company
        Bios Fuel. </p>
      <p>But scientists remain sceptical and say an engine running on
        water defies the laws of physics. </p>
      <p>Bios Fuel began with a concept in 1996, as founder Steve Ryan
        was tinkering with an old motorbike engine in an Auckland
        garage. </p>
      <p>He started to believe that burning the hydrogen contained in
        water in a combustion engine was not just science fiction. </p>
      <p>In 2002 he left a finance career to focus on researching the
        concept. </p>
      <p>Two years ago Mr Ryan went public, running a 350cc motorbike on
        water for the 60 Minutes television show. </p>
      <p>Now Bios Fuel is preparing to drive 3000 kilometres from Darwin
        to Adelaide on a blend of waste oil and water, as part of the
        Panasonic World Solar Challenge. </p>
      <p>Mr Ryan says the water-based fuel allows hydrogen to be housed
        safely in water and released. </p>
      <p>It is blended with waste oil for lubrication and a bonding
        agent, but the power comes from the water. </p>
      <p>Waikato University senior engineering lecturer Mike Duke is
        deeply sceptical of the claims. </p>
      <p>He says the problem is that the amount of energy needed to
        extract energy from water is greater than the energy produced. </p>
      <p>There was "a lot of pseudo science out there," Dr Duke said.
        "They're claiming something that I don't buy, but if they can
        prove it to me, then I'll buy them a beer." </p>
      <p>But Mr Ryan says the fuel runs via a normal combustion system -
        it's the delivery system that is the key and must remain under
        wraps. </p>
      <p>The Solar Challenge will demonstrate the potential of
        alternative fuel technology to operate in an extreme
        environment, says company spokesman Cam Feast. </p>
      <p>"It gives us the opportunity to show that recycling second- and
        third-generation waste is an option when emulsified with water."
      </p>
      <p>A battered old 1989 Land Cruiser with 400,000 kilometres on the
        clock will be used for the challenge. </p>
      <p>The implications of water-based fuels are huge, he says. </p>
      <p>"Water doesn't have to be spring-fed, it can be waste water,
        from your shower or sink, rainwater from the gutter, or
        seawater. </p>
      <p>Diesel engines can be run on very high percentages of water and
        small amounts of waste oil for lubrication. It requires no
        electricity, no heat, and emissions consist mainly of water
        vapour." </p>
      <p>So why isn't this technology already on the shelf? </p>
      <p>Mr Ryan says scepticism from the scientific community and the
        public remains the main barrier to water-fuel technology. </p>
      <p>He says there has been more support from the United States, and
        that is where Bio Fuels will focus its efforts. </p>
      <p>"New Zealand will still be the home base, but there's a need to
        go where the market is." </p>

      <p><b>From:&nbsp; Richard Coyle &lt;racprops@cox.net&gt;</b> </p>
      <p>This is what I have seen over the past four months, sorry the
        HAFC was not good, in fact so bad I quit, after a lost/cost of
        around $20,000.00 invested. </p>
      <p>I have worked on about 12 cars and only one had a unknown
        defect. </p>
      <p>The rest all were fine good running cars. </p>
      <p>Many got good mileage at first but all have problems show up,
        some with in a couple of days. </p>
      <p>Three saw no improvement. </p>
      <p>We got better mileage in two cars (32 to 43MPG) and Then got 71
        MPG and 81 MPG up from 32 MPG stock on two other cars, and took
        two vans from 12 MPG to 19/20MPG. </p>
      <p>BUT not one would hold it,&nbsp; all faded away with in a few
        days to a week and all got problems, like stuck idle motors (2),
        boiling water and gunk in the motors,(4) two got plugged air
        filters, one HAFC blew apart and sprayed chemical all over the
        engine. </p>
      <p>One van is a 87 MiniVan and has no computer to fight us but it
        loses it mileage with in a week and we have to clean and renew
        its water and chemicals. <br>
        It seems we are cracking the chemical not the water. </p>
      <p>Now I sure you will say I do not know what I am doing, perhaps,
        I was trained by one of their best trainers and certified as a
        trainer/teacher myself, and IF I did not know what I was doing
        how did I get such high mileage's figures?? </p>
      <p>I quit the company when I saw all of the last cars: two vans
        and four cars and the problems we were getting, two idle motors
        stuck, three cars with idle problems, boiling water in one car,
        soft hoses, hoses slipping off fittings, a car when it lost a
        hose and sprayed chemical all over the engine, heard from a
        dealer melt downs was common, heard from Mike Holler on a tech
        line call how someone had to buy a new transmission when a HAFC
        leaked and ate a hole though the aluminum case, blame was placed
        on installer, bet he did not know how soft the crap hoses get at
        engine temps, might rethink the cause of that failure...NO
        safety to cut power to cell if it runs dry, no way for car to
        run right with a downed cell.... </p>
      <p>Lack of any instructions to add bubblier...( now added I
        hear...) </p>
      <p>I for one can not afford to buy someone a new motor after this
        system eats the motor. I sure can not afford to buy EVERYONE a
        new motor... </p>
      <p>I have been warning everyone I could with this email: </p>
      <p>I will repeat this warning as often as needed. On any and all
        Hydro systems: </p>
      <p>There are two main risks: explosion and chemical damage to your
        engine. </p>
      <p>Beware of any that call for lots of chemical, (KOH, NaOH (lye))
        use double bubblers to help catch any before going to your
        motor. It does not stay in the tanks but can get into your motor
        as gas, I will post pictures of a Bubblier that contains this
        gunk and how it coats the walls to show you of this problem. </p>
      <p>http://www.racprops.com/HAFC/Crud%20in%20Bubblier/ </p>
      <p>Feed gas below your air filter to let it be you last line of
        defense. </p>
      <p>DO NOT use any of the wire and glass jar units. </p>
      <p>What every unit you get if they do not tell you to control the
        main relay with the Fuel Pump relay, be worried what else they
        did not tell you correctly. </p>
      <p>NEVER NEVER set it up to turn on any other way BUT so it comes
        on after the motor is running and is turned off automatically
        with the motor. </p>
      <p>I know of three cases where this was NOT done, one burst his
        air cleaner, another broke his intake manifold and the third one
        was lucky his battery was dead that morning as his ran as long
        as the battery was able to power it, one spark and good by
        truck. </p>
      <p>Many cells start making gas within seconds and it can fill the
        air cleaner before you get started, add a slight misfire and
        BOOM. </p>
      <p>NEVER NEVER hook it up to any engine vacuum. </p>
      <p>The Fuel pump relay is the only way to go. </p>
      <p>IF there is no fuel pump relay (like Toyota) use the oil
        presser sender. </p>
      <p>I feel this is so important I will give the design away. </p>

      <div class="text">EUREKA SPRINGS -- Are the high prices of fuel
        getting to you??Do you cringe whenever you pull up to the pumps,
        or when the electric bill arrives in the mail?
        <p>If the answer is yes, it's a safe bet most Americans share
          your concern. </p>
        <p>But Jeff Falk has a different way of dealing with the current
          economic meltdown. </p>
        <p>The generator in his shop runs on tap water. </p>
        <p>"This is a technology that goes against the grain of world
          economics, from the point of view of the oil companies," said
          Falk, whose has designed and built everything from race cars
          to aircraft to speed boats. "Anybody who really thinks the
          government is going to embrace this is probably wrong. They'd
          probably lock you up first." </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Falk has done it. Starting five years ago after
          he read about it, he has built an electricity producing
          generator that runs on hydrogen rather than fossil fuels. </p>
        <p><b>Hydrogen safer than you think</b> </p>
        <p>"There is a lot of propaganda about how dangerous hydrogen
          is," Falk said. "Not true. You can't approach it like fossil
          fuels, there are different rules. Unlike fossil fuels, which
          are heavier than air and pool, creating potential explosive
          hazards, hydrogen is the lightest element there is. It
          disperses. It will go right through the ceiling if you don't
          contain it." </p>
        <p>Falk points out another vital distinction between hydrogen
          and fossil fuels. </p>
        <p>"Burning hydrogen produces no radiant heat," he said. "It's
          the hydrocarbon emissions from burning gasoline, for instance,
          that burn you if you get in its way. The hydrocarbon emissions
          are also the source of its pollution." </p>
        <p>Falk uses high-frequency DC/AC hybrid pulsed electrolyzers to
          separate the hydrogen and oxygen from ordinary tap water. </p>
        <p>An electrolyzer runs a current through the water, splitting
          the H2O molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. </p>
        <p><b>Anyone can electrolyze</b> </p>
        <p>Many will remember the familiar high school science
          experiment where wires are attached to any two-poled battery,
          then into two water-filled containers. As the current splits
          the molecules, one bottle will fill with oxygen, the other
          with hydrogen. </p>
        <p>This is a little more complex. </p>
        <p>Falk's electrolyzers do the same thing, using a small
          current, high frequency and high voltages to initiate the
          process. </p>
        <p>Once the electrolyzer begins producing hydrogen, the
          generator produces enough power to fuel itself and more. </p>
        <p>Because hydrogen burns so quickly, steam is channeled to slow
          down the burn. </p>
        <p>"You couldn't run appliances off this generator at this
          point," Falk said. "The amperage is too low. But I'm refining
          it. My goal it to have the power company come out and remove
          their pole and then go away, because I won't need them
          anymore." </p>
        <p>For every .75 amps going into the generator, 22 come out. </p>
        <p>Falk said ideally two generators would be needed, so that one
          could be serviced from time to time. </p>
        <p><b>Dinosaur snot unattractive fuel source</b> </p>
        <p>"Why do we want to keep pumping dinosaur snot out of the
          ground and burning it?" Falk asked. "How primitive can you
          get? Why don't we just leave the rest of it in the ground
          until we can find something better to do with it than that?" </p>
        <p>Falk speculated units sufficient to power home use could be
          mass produced for about $7,500 each. </p>
        <p>"Look at this," Falk said, holding a temperature sensor near
          the generator's exhaust. "Right now the exhaust is 228
          degrees. If this were a gasoline generator, the temperature
          would be more like 800 degrees." </p>
        <p>Falk said the his model generator uses about a pint of water
          an hour to produce 7,500 watts of electricity. </p>
        <p><b>DIY possible</b> </p>
        <p>"Most of this equipment I got off the Internet, the parts and
          the info on how to do it," Falk said. "Eventually I can get
          off the grid without having to live by candlelight, and save
          money too." </p>
        <p>In addition to the water-powered generator, Falk is working
          on an improved, highly efficient solar panel design which he
          expects to have up and running shortly. </p>
