          Unidentified Author / Untitled Article:</b> </p>
      <p>Back in 1966 Gulley invented an auto engine that ran on
        magnets. Of course, we all know such a thing is impossible
        (don’t we?) --- as did Joe Creason of the Louisville
        Courier-Journal who took photographs of and witnessed it in
        1966. Detroit got wind of it and sent their engineers down to
        Kentucky to talk to Gulley. A Mr Hahn --- bigshot engineer at
        Ford --- looked at Gulley’s charts and patents (registration #
        211,702,317, Electric Motor) and told him it wouldn’t work. At
        that time, the engine didn’t work --- but not fro design
        defects. Gulley had built the engine out of old washing machine
        parts with no precision fittings and it had run almost 600 miles
        before it shook itself apart. </p>
      <p>Hahn made one amusing mistake. On his flight out of Kentucky he
        sat down next to Gulley’s attorney (unbeknownst to Hahn) and
        proceeded to tell him all about Gulley’s motor and what made it
        work! </p>
      <p>Gulley was later offered $35 million for the rights to hi
        sengine by GM and refused to sell unless GM would promise
        production. Shortly afterwards an unidentified male crawled
        under Gulley’s backyard fence to take a shot at him with a heavy
        caliber pistol. When the gun went off Gulley instantly grabbed a
        20-gauge shotgun parked in the doorway and filled the guy full
        of #4 buckshot. Gulley, thinking he had been hit because of hot
        stucco that had fallen down his shirt from the bullet striking
        near him, walked back into the house to call the law. When he
        went back outside the body was gone --- but the ground where the
        man had fallen was covered with so much blood it looked like
        someone had been slaughtering a hog. </p>
      <p>Gulley’s house has been broken into and ransacked repeatedly
        since then. </p>

      <p>If all goes well, in the near future --- the "very near"
        future, he insists, John W. Gulley of Gratz finally will unwrap
        and demonstrate publicly the non-fueled, non-polluting,
        noiseless and self-sustaining electric engine he’s been working
        on in secrecy for 25 years. </p>
      <p>In Gulley’s naturally prejudiced judgment, which some experts
        have sneered at but which has made qualified believers of
        others, is the automobile of the future. </p>
      <p>However, he’s quick to add that a power source for automobiles
        is only one of its potential uses since, in his words, it can be
        modified for application for everything "from sewing machines to
        submarines". </p>
      <p>The engine Gulley plans to demonstrate is called the
        Challenger, and it’s more efficient than prototype models he has
        put together before. Like the previous devices, it is based on
        the timed discharge of high voltage electricity from capacitors
        into the field of coils of a modified electric motor. </p>
      <p>Now that may sound like a lot of double talk to us average
        laymen, but reduced to simple terms it means that the engine, if
        proven, could truly revolutionize the auto industry since it
        would weigh a furth as much, could be built for half the cost
        and would operate without the air-polluting fuel of a
        conventional combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Although Gulley has hinted at plans to show his engine to the
        public several times in the past, various complications --- his
        health, patent problems, misunderstandings with his backers,
        vandals who have broken into his workshop and destroyed his
        prototypes --- have prevented him from doing so. This time, he
        persists, all the pieces are in place and the unveiling
        definitely will be held. </p>
      <p>Gulley, who learned motor and generator skills during 13 years
        in the Army, claims to have been besieged with offers from
        potential investors after news of his invention was revealed
        here in 1966. But he has turned down all offers because he was
        convinced they "came from gas and oil people who would throw my
        plans into the ocean". </p>
      <p>Any arrangement he makes for producing the engine will include
        a guarantee that ir will be marketed in competition with those
        presently on the market and also that it will be manufactured
        mainly in Kentucky. </p>
      <p>Gulley’s greatest detractors have been those who say wheat he
        claims to have done is an invasion of the never-never land of
        perpetual motion. </p>
      <p>"Only God is perpetual", he rebuts simply. </p>
      <p>And so the mystery of whether or not John W. Gulley has
        invented the engine of the future or just another pipe dream
        soon may be answered. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Three or four months ago I wrote about John W. Gulley, a Gratz,
        KY inventor who has come up with a brand new concept in a
        compact unit to power automobiles electrically. </p>
      <p>The Gulley idea, which is based on a unit that generates its
        own current as it operates, sounded so much like perpetual
        motion, the power principle that man has dreamed about since the
        dawn of time, that the story stirred up an unusual amount of
        interest. </p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, just this week I received two letters
        asking about the invention, bringing to more than 75 the number
        of inquiries that by now hae come in from Kentucky, Indiana, and
        five other states. </p>
      <p>So here is the latest chapter in the story that, if you’ll
        pardon my leaning on the old Tom Swift series, might be titled
        "The Further Adventures of John Gulley and his Electric
        Runabout". </p>
      <p>At present the invention which Gulley calls the Cobra Queen
        Electric Powering Assembly in the papers he has filed with the
        US Patent Office, is undergoing scientific research by an
        outside engineering firm. The reason for this is to determine
        the feasibility and practicality of the assembly in areas other
        than just the electric propulsion of vehicles. </p>
      <p>Gulley is pushing to have this work completed soon so that he
        can demonstrate his idea in open competition against electric
        cars being developed by at least two major manufacturers. He
        hopes to be able to issue a challenge for public testing by
        midsummer. </p>
      <p>"I know the principles the big auto makers are using, and I
        know my assembly is far superior", insists Gulley, a motor and
        generator expert who has been working on his ideas since 1946. </p>
      <p>Reduced to simplest terms, Gulley’s power plant doesn’t depend
        on a battery --- and it was the bulky battery that had to be
        recharged every few hours that caused earlier electric cars to
        flop. His secret is a motor with a new type of winding that
        never before has been submitted to the Patent Office. A battery
        is needed only to start the unit; after that, it generates its
        own current. </p>
      <p>The power unit weighs less than half that of conventional
        gasoline engines, and any known make of gas-burning car can be
        converted to use it easily and cheaply merely by changing the
        flywheel and applying it to the main power shaft of the Cobra
        Queen, Gulley says. </p>
      <p>Since my first story, Gulley himself has been besieged by
        letters and calls from person wanting to invest in the idea,
        technical magazines wanting to do detailed articles about his
        car, and one letter from Senator Robert F. Kennedy, saying he
        was calling to to the attention of federal authorities concerned
        about air pollution. </p>
      <p>The next chapter of the story won’t be written from some months
        yet. I’ll keep you posted. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Since he’s been nursing his idea for an engine to power
        automobiles electrically for 23 years now, you’d have to say
        that John W. Gulley has the patience of a prophet. </p>
      <p>But his patience is beginning to wear a mite thin and he’s
        beginning to tire of demonstrating his idea to experts and then
        having them just tell him it’s the most revolutionary thing
        they’ve ever seen. </p>
      <p>In short, John Gulley, who lives at Gratz, KY, thinks it’s
        about time the fish started biting. </p>
      <p>After all, as he explains, every expert who has examined his
        electric powering device (including technologists for both the
        Army and Navy) have declared them to be theoretically sound. </p>
      <p>Moreover, with health exerts showing alarm over the way gas and
        diesel engines are pushing air pollution to the danger level, he
        believes the time is right for a non-polluting motor that can
        replace internal combustion engines. </p>
      <p>If it was known what his motor can do without polluting the
        air, and at a fraction of the cost of conventional methods,
        Gulley believes the public would be clamoring for his engine.
        Then not even the powerful oil and automobile lobbies, which he
        suspects are working against him, could continue to keep his
        ideas on ice. </p>
      <p>The Gulley secret, which he started developing in 1946, is a
        compact motor he has patented under the name of Cobra Electric
        Powering Assembly and which generates its own current as it
        operates. A battery is needed only for a split second on
        starting. </p>
      <p>In case you feel that sounds suspicious like the age-old theory
        of perpetual motion, you’re right. As a matte of fact, that’s
        the first hurdle Gulley has had to clear in every instance where
        skeptical experts have been converted into believers. </p>
      <p>"It isn’t perpetual motion", Gulley insists, "because bearings,
        shafts and such will wear out". </p>
      <p>Gulley’s growing impatience arises from the fact that, after
        putting his plans through computers which stamped them as sound,
        the Army Engineers have delayed having a private research
        organization start a detailed study. </p>
      <p>If something isn’t done by May 15, Gulley plans to shake things
        up with a public demonstration. He’ll take a car fitted with one
        of his engines to Bufflao, NY, and drive it across the continent
        to Los Angeles. That would prove several things, he believes:
        that the car does not use any fuel, it employs no energy except
        that generated by his motor, and it can operate at maximum speed
        limit for long distances without having to get the power source
        recharged. </p>
      <p>The Cobra Queen is only one Gulley invention. He has also
        developed the Swengine, an electric engine that drives a
        generator furnishing current back to the motor. This unit, he
        says, could power ships, the largest earth-moving machines, and
        the like. </p>
      <p>But at the moment, the Cobra Queen is the motor he’s impatient
        to unveil. </p>

      <p>John Gulley’s promise to the world of tomorrow is a noiseless,
        smooth-riding electric automobile, cost-free in operation and
        emiting no fumes to pollute the air. </p>
      <p>Working in a small, cluttered shop in rural Henry County, the
        self-styled disciple o Albert Einstein claims his machine is
        ready for mass production. </p>
      <p>Further, he adds, the Einsteinian principles that make his car
        run can be modified for application in the entire field of
        mechanical movements --- "everything from a sewing machine to a
        submarine". </p>
      <p>"The day is coming", he said, "when all household appliance
        will run on their own power, with no help from electricity wired
        into the house. </p>
      <p>Such talk naturally draws more smiling disbelief than it does
        open-mouthed awe from scientists and engineers, especially
        coming, as it does, from a high-school dropout and self-taught
        inventor, working in the unlikely location of Gratz (population
        70). </p>
      <p>The scientific sneers come, however, only fro those who have
        only heard the 64-year old Gulley’s "impossible" theories, his
        claims of taking up where Einstein left off in the "unknown
        field" of gravity as a source of electric energy. </p>
      <p>In Penfield, NY, lives a reputable young scientist who spent
        three months with Gulley and was made a qualified believer. </p>
      <p>Van Combs said from his home in Penfield that Gulley "can do
        things from a practical point of view that defy present
        scientific evidence. </p>
      <p>I can understand that he must be secretive, but he has got to
        find somebody he can trust and allow them to take his devices
        apart. I don’t know why he has delayed. It makes it all look a
        little odd". </p>
      <p>Gulley says his automobile is powered only by his own design of
        cils and a generator, using a battery for the sole purpose of
        activating the motor. </p>
      <p>He says he drove an experimental machine "27 miles short of 600
        miles at zero cost" and that when it stopped running "there
        still was no trouble in the electrical system". </p>
      <p>Gulley says his car engine weighs a fourth as much as an
        internal combustion engine, can be built for half the cost, and
        will last 10 times as long. </p>
      <p>Gulley claims that modifications produce a motor capable of
        10,000 rpm, comparable to the average 8-cylinder car’s 5000 to
        6000 rpm. </p>
      <p>"My devices are important to the aircraft people too", he said.
        "They can run as fast as the jet. They can power big earth
        movers, cranes and anything needing great power". </p>
      <p>So why doesn’t Gulley get on with the show? </p>
      <p>His story is that he has received offers up to $36 million for
        his patents from men representing auto makers who "would throw
        my plans in the Atlantic Ocean just so they can protect the big
        oil and gasoline people". </p>
      <p>He said he will demand guaranteed arrangements form trustworthy
        financiers who will actually market his devices in competition
        with present industrial giants. </p>
      <p>He will also demand, he said, that most of the manufacturing
        machinery, for parts and assembly, be housed in Kentucky as part
        of a dream to make Kentucky the "greatest industrial state in
        the country". </p>
      <p>Living now on a disability pension form the Army, Gulley was
        asked to explain his ability to reject such offers as $36
        million. </p>
      <p>"I would have just a big stack of money to fool with", he said.
        "I wouldn’t have to work. When this thin is worked out the way I
        want it to be and the money does come along, I plan definitely
        to give 9 out of every 10 dollars I receive to feed the hungry
        people of the world. I have no desire for wealth". </p>

      </p>
      <p>It’s been an agonizingly long waiting period --- going on 30
        years, actually --- but John W. Gulley of Gratz, KY believes
        1974 just may be the year when he makes a major contribution to
        the energy crisis. </p>
      <p>To say the least, in the next few days some high brass from the
        US Army Engineers’ Office of Power Technology will be coming to
        Guley’s garage workshop in Gratz to look into his claim that he
        has perfected an idea that could make gasoline a thing of the
        past as a transportation power source. </p>
      <p>You see, Gulley is the inventor of the "Swengine", a small,
        noiseless, self-contined electric engine that, according to him,
        could be modified to power anything from sewing machines to
        submarines --- but especially automobiles. </p>
      <p>Gulley is now convinced, he says, that the skeptics who for
        years scoffed at his inventions are now being won over and that
        actual production of his Swengine could begin soon. </p>
      <p>If this comes to pass, if the Swengine lives up to his claims,
        the result could be the most revolutionary development in the
        history of the automobile industry. </p>
      <p>Imagine, if you will, a car engine that not only weighs a
        fourth as much as normal internal combustion engines, but
        requires no fuel, no cooling, no intake or exhaust systems and
        doesn’t emit carbon monoxide fumes to befoul the air. Add to
        these energy and environmental advantages Gulley’s conviction
        that it can be built for half the cost and las 10 ties as long
        as conventional engines and the potential impact of the Swengine
        is mind-boggling. </p>
      <p>Although the Swengine is patented, as is also the Quagga Scout,
        a motor, it is difficult to describe Gulley’s invention in
        detail because it involves many so-called "impossible" theories.
        But put loosely in lay language, the Swengine operates on his
        own design of electromagnets and a generator that powers the
        engine after it has been started by a battery. There being no
        friction bearings, the engine has indefinite life expectancy. </p>
      <p>Since all that suggest the field of gravity as a source of
        electrical energy, skeptics have said Gulley is laying claim to
        having created perpetual motion. </p>
      <p>"This is not perpetual motion", he counters. "The material used
        in this engine will wear out in time and for that reason, if no
        other, it isn’t perpetual". </p>
      <p>Gulley, now 67, is a motor and generator expert who learned his
        skill during 13 years of Army service. He started thinking about
        an electric car in 1946 after he was retired because of a
        circulatory ailment. </p>
      <p>After repeated experiments, he finally developed an engine he
        called the Cobra Queen and tested it in a car. He wasn’t given
        the time of day when he started trying to sell his idea to
        manufacturers. In retrospect, he suspects the powerful oil and
        auto lobbies have been working against him all along because of
        what his invention could do to them. </p>
      <p>Finally, after the Swengine evolved from continued
        experimenting and since he felt he could trust the Army not to
        put his idea on ice if it could be proven, he decided to try the
        Washington route. At first that was slow going, too, but in the
        last year, with the help of Senator Marlow Cook and
        Representative Tim Lee Carter, who set up appointments for him
        with the right people, the Army began to show more and more
        interest. </p>
      <p>Although he’s been disappointed before, Gulley believes the
        upcoming meeting with engineers from the Office of Power
        Technology may be the light at the end of the tunnel. He hopes
        to have an engine in his car at that time to use in a
        demonstration. </p>
      <p>Who knows? Maybe a breakthrough the energy-starved world needs
        will be coming from a setting as unlikely as a garage workshop
        at Gratz, Kentucky. If it’s ever going to come, now is precisely
        the right time. </p>
