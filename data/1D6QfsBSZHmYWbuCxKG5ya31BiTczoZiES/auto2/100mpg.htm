        <p><b>The 100 MPG Carburetor Myth</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been numerous books
        and plans written purporting to "reveal the secrets" of the
        famous "200 mpg carburetor," a device supposedly built in 1935
        by Charles Nelson Pogue of Winnipeg, Canada. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of this writing Mr. Pogue is
        in a nursing home in Winnipeg, Canada. Several of our customers
        have visited with him. Each came away with a slightly different
        story. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Pogue actually did
        manufacture a carburetor he titled the "Winnipeg" in the late
        1930s; 317 all told. One of our customers had one and claimed it
        delivered 35 mpg on a Ford Mustang with considerable loss of
        power; however, he agreed to let us have it for testing and we
        are still waiting. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are two problems with the
        "Pogue principle," which is being touted in high mileage
        seminars and books all over the country. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is that the Pogue
        carburetor violates the first law of thermodynamics, a commonly
        accepted scientific postulate that has been with us since 1830.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The law is written as
        follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; U = q + w </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, in simple English, if you
        have chemical energy in a system (U) in its expenditure, it must
        equal q (heat) plus work (w). That is, if you have 100,000 BTUs
        in a gallon of fuel in which you then burn the end products—in a
        system operating at 30% efficiency—you will have 30,000 BTUs of
        work and 70,000 BTUs of heat. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything you put inside the
        combustion chamber can do only one of two things during the
        ignition stroke. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Produce energy (mechanical
        movement) during the reaction. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Absorb energy (leave out the
        exhaust as heat) during the reaction. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There has been a lot written
        about the "unburned particulates" furnishing the extra fuel for
        the extra 50 mpg or so, but if you’ll check the Fish dynatune
        emissions levels you’ll see there aren’t enough of them to get
        you another 300 yards down the road. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second problem encountered
        with Pogue-type devices is that—in some instances—they actually
        predate the carburetor. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let’s elaborate in both cases. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back before the carburetor as we
        know it came into being in the 1890s there were several novel
        methods of getting fuel into the engine. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One method was using a
        kerosene-soaked rag to drip fuel into the engine. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another method—that became quite
        common—was allowing air to pass over the surface of gasoline and
        then to be sucked into the engine. Sometimes a valve—called a
        "mixing valve"—would be positioned between the fuel reservoir
        and the engine. The valve would pop open when the downward
        motion of the piston created enough suction. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This method—and variations of
        it—have been touted all over the United States in "100 MPG
        CARBURETOR" seminars sponsored by various individuals as being
        the "ultimate" in sophisticated fuel systems, usually with
        exhaust heat or radiator water added to "vaporize" the fuel much
        more effectively than a standard carburetor. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a number of things
        wrong with the concept of such a "100 MPG" system. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first is that the gasolines
        in use during the days of the mixing valve were far more
        volatile than the ones in use today. Some of you may remember
        when you could stand ten feet away from an open pan of gasoline,
        light a match, and watch the gasoline immediately catch fire. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gasolines were changed in the
        1930s with the advent of the catalytic cracker now used in
        petroleum refining. Carburetors like the Pogue, which depend on
        easily vaporized gasoline, simply will not work with today’s
        gasolines. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second seminar-taught error
        is the method of using exhaust heat or radiator water to heat
        the fuel to the "vapor" point to extend the mileage. Warming or
        preheating fuel does have some value, but it’s limited. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider using hot water from
        the radiator to vaporize the fuel first. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today’s gasolines do not
        completely vaporize until they reach 450º Fahrenheit heat, while
        the maximum temperature of the water in today’s pressure
        radiators reaches only 250º Fahrenheit. You just can’t heat a
        substance to 450º Fahrenheit using a 250º Fahrenheit heat
        source. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, not on this planet. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhaust heat works a bit
        differently. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the function of an
        internal combustion engine to change chemical energy into heat,
        and then the heat into mechanical movement. If the heat is not
        changed into mechanical movement it simply leaves—as heat. Any
        time you feel heat coming off an engine you are feeling wasted
        energy. The exhaust ports of an engine that operated at 100%
        efficiency would be ice-cold to the touch since ALL the heat
        would have been changed into mechanical movement. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which means that the more
        efficient your engine is the less exhaust heat you’re going to
        have. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, if you have 600º
        Fahrenheit exhaust heat produced by one gallon of gas over a
        20-mile trip and you use "exhaust heat" to "vaporize" the fuel
        and go 60 miles, what produces the 600º Fahrenheit heat for the
        next 40 miles? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you answered "two more
        gallons of fuel," go to the head of the class! </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously, there are ways to go
        several times the distance on a gallon of fuel (none of them
        involving carburetors); it’s just that the foregoing examples
        aren’t two of them. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In short, Charles Nelson Pogue
        was a machinist with no formal training in thermodynamics and
        may have actually believed that what he was attempting would
        work. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All a carburetor can do is meter
        and atomize fuel in correct proportion to air. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any further increases have to
        come from increasing the thermal efficiency of the engine itself
        (such as raising compression) or reducing rolling friction. And
        this last is why a diesel locomotive with steel wheels will go
        ten times as far on a gallon of fuel as a diesel truck of the
        same weight with rubber tires. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Pogue—or any similar
        carburetor—to go 100 mpg on a gallon of fuel on a vehicle
        normally going 20 mpg, the air/fuel ratio would have to be in
        the neighborhood of 75 to 1 or better. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any second-year college
        chemistry student knows that.<br>
