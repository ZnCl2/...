      <p><b><br>
          From:&nbsp; Richard Coyle &lt;racprops@cox.net&gt;</b> </p>
      <p>This is what I have seen over the past four months, sorry the
        HAFC was not good, in fact so bad I quit, after a lost/cost of
        around $20,000.00 invested. </p>
      <p>I have worked on about 12 cars and only one had a unknown
        defect. </p>
      <p>The rest all were fine good running cars. </p>
      <p>Many got good mileage at first but all have problems show up,
        some with in a couple of days. </p>
      <p>Three saw no improvement. </p>
      <p>We got better mileage in two cars (32 to 43MPG) and Then got 71
        MPG and 81 MPG up from 32 MPG stock on two other cars, and took
        two vans from 12 MPG to 19/20MPG. </p>
      <p>BUT not one would hold it,&nbsp; all faded away with in a few
        days to a week and all got problems, like stuck idle motors (2),
        boiling water and gunk in the motors,(4) two got plugged air
        filters, one HAFC blew apart and sprayed chemical all over the
        engine. </p>
      <p>One van is a 87 MiniVan and has no computer to fight us but it
        loses it mileage with in a week and we have to clean and renew
        its water and chemicals. <br>
        It seems we are cracking the chemical not the water. </p>
      <p>Now I sure you will say I do not know what I am doing, perhaps,
        I was trained by one of their best trainers and certified as a
        trainer/teacher myself, and IF I did not know what I was doing
        how did I get such high mileage's figures?? </p>
      <p>I quit the company when I saw all of the last cars: two vans
        and four cars and the problems we were getting, two idle motors
        stuck, three cars with idle problems, boiling water in one car,
        soft hoses, hoses slipping off fittings, a car when it lost a
        hose and sprayed chemical all over the engine, heard from a
        dealer melt downs was common, heard from Mike Holler on a tech
        line call how someone had to buy a new transmission when a HAFC
        leaked and ate a hole though the aluminum case, blame was placed
        on installer, bet he did not know how soft the crap hoses get at
        engine temps, might rethink the cause of that failure...NO
        safety to cut power to cell if it runs dry, no way for car to
        run right with a downed cell.... </p>
      <p>Lack of any instructions to add bubblier...( now added I
        hear...) </p>
      <p>I for one can not afford to buy someone a new motor after this
        system eats the motor. I sure can not afford to buy EVERYONE a
        new motor... </p>
      <p>I have been warning everyone I could with this email: </p>
      <p>I will repeat this warning as often as needed. On any and all
        Hydro systems: </p>
      <p>There are two main risks: explosion and chemical damage to your
        engine. </p>
      <p>Beware of any that call for lots of chemical, (KOH, NaOH (lye))
        use double bubblers to help catch any before going to your
        motor. It does not stay in the tanks but can get into your motor
        as gas, I will post pictures of a Bubblier that contains this
        gunk and how it coats the walls to show you of this problem. </p>
      <p>http://www.racprops.com/HAFC/Crud%20in%20Bubblier/ </p>
      <p>Feed gas below your air filter to let it be you last line of
        defense. </p>
      <p>DO NOT use any of the wire and glass jar units. </p>
      <p>What every unit you get if they do not tell you to control the
        main relay with the Fuel Pump relay, be worried what else they
        did not tell you correctly. </p>
      <p>NEVER NEVER set it up to turn on any other way BUT so it comes
        on after the motor is running and is turned off automatically
        with the motor. </p>
      <p>I know of three cases where this was NOT done, one burst his
        air cleaner, another broke his intake manifold and the third one
        was lucky his battery was dead that morning as his ran as long
        as the battery was able to power it, one spark and good by
        truck. </p>
      <p>Many cells start making gas within seconds and it can fill the
        air cleaner before you get started, add a slight misfire and
        BOOM. </p>
      <p>NEVER NEVER hook it up to any engine vacuum. </p>
      <p>The Fuel pump relay is the only way to go. </p>
      <p>IF there is no fuel pump relay (like Toyota) use the oil
        presser sender. </p>
      <p>I feel this is so important I will give the design away. </p>
