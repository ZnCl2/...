      <span style="font-style: italic;">George Parker, president of Fuel
        Vapour Tech, stands with prototype car at Victoria airport
        yesterday.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      George Parker has taken the expression "running on fumes"
      literally, designing a fuel delivery system that runs on fuel
      vapours instead of liquid fuel, allowing him to claim that his
      prototype vehicle can achieve an estimated 2.6 litres per 100
      kilometres on the highway.<br>
      <br>
      Parker's company, Maple Ridge-based Fuelvapor Technologies, has
      designed a three-wheeled vehicle around a turbocharged 1,500 cc
      four-cylinder engine that showcases the company's patented fuel
      vapour technology. His invention raises the air to fuel ratio,
      which is usually 14.7:1 (14.7 parts of air to one part of
      gasoline) to 20:1, which helps reduce fuel usage. Parker claims
      that his invention can produce as much vapour as the engine needs
      and will eliminate the fuel-injection system found in current
      vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      The Fuelvapour vehicle, called the Ale, does not give up
      performance to achieve the high fuel economy. The 180 horsepower
      Honda engine is capable of 0-100 km/h acceleration times in the
      five-second range with the top end electronically limited to
      approximately 220 km/h.<br>
      <br>
      Parker also says that the vehicle produces 75 per cent less CO2
      than a conventional engine and does not need a catalytic
      converter.<br>
      <br>
      The vehicle, which is certified for sale in B.C., can seat two in
      tandem. The prototype has motorcycle plates on it.<br>
      <br>
      Parker expects to deliver the first batch of completed cars
      sometime in January 2008. The hand-built cars will cost
      approximately $75,000. Parker suggests that with mass production,
      the price can drop to between $30,000 to $40,000.<br>
      <br>
      Parker is entering the car in the Automotive X-Prize competition.
      The California-based foundation behind the competition is looking
      to inspire individuals and companies to come up with a
      super-efficient vehicle that can be produced.<br>
      <br>
      Parker was in Victoria recently in talks with a Sidney-based
      company exploring the possibly of replacing the vehicle's
      fibreglass body on a tubular steel frame with one built from
      carbon fibre.<br>
      <br>
      Switching to the composite material could result in weight savings
      of between 30 to 40 per cent, which could result in a smaller
      engine and even better fuel economy.<br>
      <br>
      Entrepreneurs and inventors with concept cars touting
      super-efficiency are not new, says Lawrence Pitt, a research
      coordinator with the Institute of Integrated Energy Systems at the
      University of Victoria.<br>
      <br>
      "Vehicles offering high fuel economy have sex appeal these days,
      but it takes time and an exotic amount of money to bring the
      concept to market." says Pitt. While he approaches each new idea
      with "healthy skepticism," he points out that all the innovators
      of the modern automobile started out in roughly the same way 100
      years ago. "There is always a niche for such cars. The company's
      success depends on the size of the niche."<br>

      <div style="text-align: center;"><big><span style="font-weight:
            bold;">Device Saves Fuel, Cuts Emissions</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A device that could help New Zealanders save fuel and reduce
      carbon emissions had its international debut in Queenstown on
      Monday.<br>
      <br>
      The hydro-charger, a small black box that can be retrofitted to
      any internal combustion engine, splits hydrogen from water and
      uses it to boost the fuel supply while reducing carbon emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Gary Rovin, managing director of Vision Energy Ltd, the
      Queenstown-based private investment company which has New Zealand
      distribution and future manufacturing rights for the American
      invention, said New Zealand already spent $4.6 billion a year on
      imported fossil fuel.<br>
      <br>
      American trials have so far shown fuel savings of an average 12
      percent, up to 70 percent, and emission reduction of at least 80
      per cent.<br>
      <br>
      Monday's launch showed the device in action on cars, buses,
      trucks, tractors and a generator.<br>
      <br>
      John Dee, from Global Energy Options (GEO) which developed the
      device, said he knew of no other company that had used hydrolysis
      technology to produce enough hydrogen from a car battery to save
      fuel as well as cut emissions.<br>
      <br>
      "We all know from high school science that you can drop a 9V
      battery in water and produce bubbles of hydrogen and oxygen. This
      is the same thing, but bigger."<br>
      <br>
      Their "secret formula of electrolytes in minute amounts" hugely
      increased the amount of hydrogen so produced. This was then
      introduced to the engine at the air inlet where, under high
      pressure, it ignited and broke up the fuel's long chain
      hydrocarbons.<br>
      <br>
      This both increased fuel efficiency and cut polluting waste
      products, especially big particulates, Mr Dee said. The hydrogen
      itself also acted as a fuel.<br>
      <br>
      GEO has a government agreement to supply the hydro-charger to New
      Delhi, in a bid to clean up that city's polluted air in the
      lead-up to the 2010 Commonwealth Games.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on further field tests and development, the devices
      could be commercially available in New Zealand by March, he added.<br>
      <br>
      The price had not yet been determined, as research continued to
      make production cheaper, Mr Dee said.<br>
      <br>
      Already, trials had shown the investment would be paid back within
      a year.<br>
      <br>
      Canterbury's Drivertek International managing director Bill Frost,
      who installed a hydo-charger in his Nissan last Friday, was
      impressed it had already shown an almost 10 percent fuel saving.<br>
      <br>
      Queenstown Connectabus owner Ewen McCammon said that even in only
      20 hours of trial, both visible and measurable emission levels had
      declined significantly.<br>
      <br>
      If proven commercially successful, Vision Energy planned to
      manufacture the device in New Zealand, Mr Rovin said.<br>

      When gasoline prices topped the $2 level back in 2005, Jack
      Talbert dusted off an invention his father had worked on nearly 30
      years ago.<br>
      <br>
      "I remembered that my father had made a carburetor that would
      pre-stage the fuel by converting it into a gas before it went into
      the intake manifold," Talbert said.<br>
      <br>
      By modifying the "fuel blender" device his father once worked on,
      he is achieving his goal of beating the pump.<br>
      <br>
      Talbert figures he's getting about 49 miles per gallon, which
      covers more than 900 miles of driving and would be considered good
      with one of today's tiny hybrid cars. But Talbert isn't driving a
      hybrid; his car is a 1981 Oldsmobile Delta 88, with a gas-guzzling
      350 V8 engine. Talbert bought the Olds for $500 specifically for
      his project.<br>
      <br>
      "I've always preferred big cars," Talbert said. He filled the
      car's 20-gallon tank in November of 2006 and didn't fill up again
      until March of 2007. He was living in his hometown of Abilene at
      the time.<br>
      <br>
      To fashion the modification, he relied on things he had learned
      from his dad, and also from Tom Ogle, a Texas inventor who
      obtained a patent for the device in 1977. When George Talbert
      began experimenting in the 1970s, he used a metal tube, similar to
      a diving snorkel, and mounted it on a 1969 Lincoln Continental.
      The device reportedly increased fuel efficiency from 12 mpg to
      about 70 mph. Talbert was five years old at the time.<br>
      <br>
      "I remember my father couldn't get the hood down, so he left it
      off because of that little snorkel sticking up," said Talbert, 39,
      who lives in Manhattan.<br>
      <br>
      Talbert began his experimentation by reverse engineering the "fuel
      blender." He knew that fuel, like a wood log in a fire, must go
      through four known states of matter to complete the cycle. Wood
      will reach its flashpoint, and then the outgases will combine with
      oxygen, leaving oxidized ashes behind as the process is finished.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel must also reach a particular temperature in order to begin
      the reaction. When fuel is in a vapor state the process requires
      less energy and heat to conclude. This process is process is
      called gasoline vaporization.<br>
      <br>
      "Right now I am the only one I know of that has the vapor
      converted car, although it's been done in the past," Talbert said.
      "I wasn't the first."<br>
      <br>
      This was not Tablert's first attempt at perfecting the project
      started by his father, who passed away in 1982. In 1993 he used it
      on a 1975 Cadillac, and it worked, even though the engine ran
      rough, for about two days. The device eventually was torn up by
      the stresses under the hood due to the size of the Caddy's V8
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      Talbert said the key to getting the "fuel blender" to work this
      time was going with smaller rubber tubing than what had been used
      by his predecessors. He used tubing measuring 1/8th of an inch in
      diameter as opposed to 2 inches in diameter. He explained that
      with a larger line, only the high octane portion of the fuel was
      being vaporized.<br>
      <br>
      "There is a separate little can under the hood, and fuel is pumped
      from the gasoline tank into the can and then the can becomes the
      fuel reserve," Talbert said. "Because the can is small and the
      line in it is small, then it completely vaporizes whatever is in
      that can.<br>
      <br>
      Talbert admits that while his Olds Delta 88 gets great gas
      mileage, it is hard to drive. It is also slow to accelerate,
      taking about two minutes to get up to 55 mph. Therefore, a person
      driving from Manhattan to Topeka would want to take U.S. 24, and
      not I-70.<br>
      <br>
      "You want it to be a straight shot with not a lot of hills," he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      Fuel is controlled by a plumbing value mounted under the dash on
      the right side of the steering wheel.<br>
      <br>
      "My father could never get the car to run and idle," Talbert said.
      "He could get it to idle real good, or he could get it to run
      good, but he could never get it to do both. By putting a fill
      control valve in the fuel line when we need more fuel we just turn
      the valve up."<br>
      <br>
      Talbert's son, Bruce, a high school student, has been driving the
      Olds Delta 88 for about a month. Jack kids Bruce that he has a
      "lead foot" and has more problems with the car dying out at stop
      lights.<br>
      <br>
      Trying to promote his invention, Talbert has consulted with the
      small business development department at Washburn University and
      the Pottawatomie County Economic Development Corporation.<br>
      <br>
      "Jack is a pretty entrepreneurial fellow," PCEDC director Bob Cole
      said. "He needed to know where he can get a technical evaluation
      of the device and find investors."<br>
      <br>
      With gasoline prices skyrocketing between $3 and $4 in recent
      weeks, why aren't the major car manufacturers jumping at a chance
      to get hydrid-like gas mileage with gas-guzzling cars?<br>
      <br>
      Today's cars are mostly port fuel-injected and they have
      electronic control modules that govern all the functions.<br>
      <br>
      "It's not that there is a problem using it with port-fuel
      injection, it just requires a pressure pump that introduces that
      vapor into the cylinder at the right time and right location,"
      Talbert said. "It literally could be in excess of a million
      dollars to get to that point. You could have another $50 million
      involved in getting it approved, and you haven't sold one car
      yet."<br>
      <br>
      Besides, even then the public may not buy it. Talbert noted a
      survey he had read reporting that it would take $5 per gallon
      gasoline before 100 percent of the respondents would make a
      lifestyle change.<br>

            mpg</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      Inventor John Weston of Port Charlotte, claims to have invented a
      device that can turn virtually any car into a gas-miser that can
      run as far as 500 miles on a single gallon. Called the Air Vapor
      Flow System, or AVFS, the device functions by vaporizing gasoline
      before it gets inducted into the engine. That saves fuel and
      reduces pollution because it allows the engine to burn more of the
      fuel that gets sucked into the combustion chamber, he contends.
      The device works on small, industrial engines or larger automobile
      engines regardless of whether they have carburetors or fuel
      injection systems, according to Weston. The device consists of a
      small, plastic tank that gets mounted under the hood of a car.
      Some hoses from the engine's air intake housing are run to the top
      of the tank so that the engine draws in vapors from above the
      level of the liquid gasoline. The device also has some additional
      features that affect its efficiency and safety that Weston is not
      disclosing. In an impromptu demonstration conducted for this
      reporter last week, Weston installed one of the devices into his
      battered 1992 Geo Storm. Scientifically, the results can be
      described as intriguing but inconclusive. Weston's car ran well on
      the vapors from the device when the level of the liquid in the
      tank was within a certain margin. The engine ran either too rich
      or too lean when the level was above or below that margin. Weston
      is convinced that the car traveled 14.8 miles on about 4 ounces of
      gasoline during the test. If accurate, that would amount to some
      473 miles per gallon. However, an exact measurement was not
      obtained due to the testing method. Weston recently tested one of
      his AVFS tanks on a gasoline-powered utility generator. Without
      the device, the generator ran for 3.5 hours. With the device, it
      ran for 14 hours on the same amount of fuel, he said. AVFS testing
      on a small engine by the firm Adiabatics Inc. in Columbus, Ind.
      The results showed it reduced hydrocarbons 71 percent and carbon
      monoxide 25 percent. The rate of fuel consumption was reduced by
      15 percent to 30 percent. But the device increased emissions of
      carbon dioxide 12 percent and nitrogen oxides 296 percent. Those
      are greenhouse and smog pollutants. Weston said those emissions
      increased because Reg Tech's engineer failed to properly adjust
      the vapor/air mixture. "Not all engineers are mechanics," Weston
      said.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
