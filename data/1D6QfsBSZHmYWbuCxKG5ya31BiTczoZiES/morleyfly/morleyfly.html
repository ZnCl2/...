      A cheap trap made from plastic pop bottles and dung has
      significantly cut the number of cases of trachoma - a major cause
      of blindness. <br>
      <br>
      Trachoma affects approximately 14m people world-wide, mainly in
      developing countries. It is thought to be spread from person to
      person by the thousands of flies which swarm in certain regions.
      In Africa's Rift Valley, for example, there could be as many as
      32,000 flies gathered in just one house. <br>
      <br>
      Professor David Morley developed a fly trap which can be built
      simply from two transparent plastic bottles, based on his
      observation that flies, following feeding, tend to fly upwards
      towards the light.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The lower bottle is plastered with mud to make it dark
      inside, and then filled with a mixture of goat droppings and cow
      urine - guaranteed to prove irresistible to flies. <br>
      After a fine meal, the flies pass up a plastic tube into a second
      bottle, left transparent to lure them. Here they die from
      exhaustion and exposure to UV light. <br>
      <br>
      The bottle went on trial in 300 Masai homes in Kenya over a year.
      The fly population was reduced by an estimated 40%, and more
      importantly, the number of trachoma cases fell by more than a
      third.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Professor Morley told New Scientist magazine: "Local
      children have been making the traps at school - the teacher made
      it part of the homework." <br>
      <br>
      Trachoma is the leading single cause of preventable blindness in
      the world. It is caused not by just one infection, but the legacy
      of repeated infections over the years. <br>
      <br>
      These cause inflammation on each occasion, and eventually the
      cumulative damage causes the eyelid to tighten and bend in on
      itself, prodding the eye with its own lashes and scarring the
      cornea. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Infections respond well in general to antibiotics, although
      there are concerns that the bacteria which cause the disease may
      be becoming resistant to drugs.<br>
      <br>
      Other techniques involve a simple 10-minute operation which turns
      the eyelid back round...<br>

      <br>
      The concept behind this fly trap is to construct it as simply as
      possible using material that is junk. It is particularly hoped
      that this may be a way of using discarded pop and drinking water
      bottles.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="FLYTRAP.GIF" height="522"
          width="251"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>The TALC Fly TrapMaterials required</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two preferably identical clear plastic bottles. The larger the
      better, they can be smooth or corrugated. One of the bottles
      should still have its screw top.<br>
      One smaller plastic bottle, this should be smooth plastic.<br>
      A small quantity of black or dark paint.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tools required</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Stanley or other sharp knife.<br>
      A small piece of string.<br>
      A pencil or other pointed instrument to make a small hole in the
      plastic bottle.<br>
      A candle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method of assembly</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the bottles is the bait bottle the other is the trap bottle
      the smaller bottle is used to cut out the trap tube.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Bait bottle</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      If the paint is very thick it may need diluting. Pour the
      equivalent of a tablespoon of paint into this bottle, if possible
      do not let it run down the side; roll the bottle so that the lower
      third is painted on the inside. Leave it to dry.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Trap bottle</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cut the bottom out of this. Make the cut just below where the
      bottle tapers into the base. Now make 8 slits upwards from where
      the base has been cut off. If the lower end of the bottle is
      corrugated, make the slits in the valleys. It should now be
      possible to push the trap bottle over the top of the trap bottle
      and make a tight fit. If at a later stage the splits in the side
      you have cut tend to tear further upwards this can be prevented by
      gluing small squares of plastic. Alternatively a ring of plastic
      is cut obliquely from another bottle of the same size, this can
      then be slipped over the bottle to prevent the cuts spreading
      upwards.<br>
      <br>
      If the flytrap is to be hung introduce a small piece of string
      under the screw top, screwing the top on tightly.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Trap Tube</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This is a piece of plastic cut from the body of the smaller
      bottle. Cut a piece of bottle 8 cms by 8 cms. Cut small slits in
      the bottom and bend these out as shown in the diagram. Now roll it
      around a pencil, wrap a piece of string around it and place it in
      hot water (three-quarters boiling one-quarter cold.) Remove the
      string, it should keep its shape. Make a hole in the screw top as
      follows. Hold it over a candle, the plastic will darken and
      soften. Push a pencil through and enlarge the hole. Push your tube
      up and through this hole and the frill you cut should now be
      pinched between the bottle top and the cap when it is screwed on
      to the bait bottle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Bait bottle</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The paint in this should now be dry. Cut two half circles half way
      down the painted part at opposite sides of the bottle, the curve
      of the circle should be upwards, now bend the flap produced
      outwards and force them down so that they remain open. These are
      the entry ports for the flies, as well as putting bait in the
      bottom of the bait bottle put some on these turned down flaps to
      attract the flies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Fly Bait</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Various baits have been used. Chicken entrails seem satisfactory
      but tend to dry up. Apparently flies like the smell produced by
      placing 250 gms of yeast in a litre of water and after two days
      adding 6 grams of Ammonium Carbonate (available from garden
      centres). Amongst the Maasai a mixture of goat dung and cows urine
      is effective.<br>
