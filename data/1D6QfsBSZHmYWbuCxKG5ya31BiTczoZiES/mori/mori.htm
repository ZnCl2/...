      <span style="font-style: italic;"> Mebiol’s hydrogel could make
        deserts flourish with crops grown on barren sand. </span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Here’s another futuristic invention that could
      completely change the future of agriculture in a desertifying
      world. Substituting an industrially produced hydrogel for soil
      makes it possible to farm on sterile desert sand. Similarly to
      Pink LEDs Grow Future Food with 90% Less Water, this amazing sci
      fi technology allows the farming of the desert, with 80 percent
      less water than needed in traditional farming.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The hydrogel technology is the invention of
      Waseda University Visiting Professor Yuichi Mori, who has years of
      experience in developing polymeric membranes for use in medical
      technologies such as blood purification and oxygen enrichment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But Mori saw the greatest need was in desert
      farming in a future world faced with explosive population growth,
      but diminishing potential for traditional soil-based agriculture
      due to soil degradation, erosion, and drought.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;His hydrogel membrane–based plant cultivation
      technology has a unique membrane technology [PDF]. The simple
      system is much more portable than traditional hydroponics.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mori has launched a company, Mebiol, to
      commercialize the technology, which solves many of the farming
      problems found in deserts, the age-old agricultural problems due
      to the unpredictability of water supplies.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The plants grow on a thin hydrophilic film made
      of hydrogel, which allows the passage of water and nutrients such
      as various ions, amino acids and sugars but not bacteria, fungi
      and viruses. This protects plants from diseases; use of pesticide
      is minimized.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The membrane looks like a plastic sheet allows
      for no-soil and low-soil farming, with the water and fertilizer
      separate from the plants roots. The roots remain dry while drawing
      water and nutrients from below the membrane, and oxygen from the
      air. Lettuce and other leaf vegetables can be grown with no soil.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Hydrogels are networks of hydrophilic (which
      means “water-loving”) polymer chains, sometimes found as a
      colloidal gel in which water is the dispersion medium. The
      hydrogel membrane in the Imec technology is only microns thick.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mebiol is the first and only company globally
      to have commercialized this kind of membrane for plant
      cultivation. Advanced membrane technologies are used in the
      medical and water purification field, but not in agriculture.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Other formulations of hydrogels have uses in
      medical treatment for blood purification and oxygen enrichment,
      and in water treatment for desalination and purification.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In agriculture use, along with eliminating the
      soil contamination that affects productivity and the quality of
      crops, one of the interesting side effects is that the plants
      synthesize a lot of sugar. The “water stress” the Imec membrane
      creates induces crops like tomatoes to synthesize large amounts of
      sugar, lycopene and other beneficial elements, leading to greater
      sweetness and higher nutritional value.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After testing the technology successfully in
      Dubai, one of the world’s most inhospitable environments for
      agriculture, the Sahara could be next.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And once he makes the desert bloom, Dr Mori
      believes that even less likely conditions could be roped in for
      producing crops for a rapidly growing world population.<br>
      <br>
      The technology will even allow cultivation on ice – or concrete!<br>

          WATER-RETAINING CARRIER FOR PLANT</span><br

      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a
      water-retaining carrier for plants, which has a water-retaining
      property in the same extent as that of a polyacrylate-based
      hydrogel and does substantially not inhibit rooting or root
      elongation. ; SOLUTION: This water-retaining carrier for the
      plants comprises a hydrogel-forming polymer which has a calcium
      ion-absorbing amount of &lt;50 mg per g of dry weight and a
      water-absorbing magnification of &gt;=100 in ion exchanged water
      (room temperature, 25[deg.]C). When the water-retaining carrier is
      used, water can be supplied to plants in amounts sufficient for
      the plants without causing calcium deficiency diseases in the
      plants.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Technical
        Field</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0001] The present invention relates to a
      water-retaining support (or carrier) for plant which can support
      or hold a plant at the time of the growth of the plant and can
      also function as a source for supplying water to the plant. More
      specifically, the present invention relates to a water-retaining
      support for plant which can supply water to a plant without
      inhibiting the growth of the plant, when the support is used as a
      water-retaining support for fluid seeding (or seeding using a
      fluid), farm cultivation, field (or bare ground) cultivation,
      virescence (or greening) engineering, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0002] The water-retaining support for plant
      according to the present invention is also usable in combination
      with another plant support such as soil so as to enhance the
      water-retaining ability of the other plant support (i.e., usable
      as a water-retaining agent) at the time the growth of a plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Background Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0003] Polycarboxylic acid-type highly
      water-absorbing resins, especially polyacrylic acid-type polymers,
      which have been used in a large quantity for diapers, menstrual
      goods, etc., are also brought into use in the field of agriculture
      due to their inexpensiveness and excellent water-retaining
      ability.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0004] For example, hydrogels of the
      polyacrylic acid-type polymers have been used as a support for
      fluid seeding; or a water-retaining support for virescence
      engineering, water-saving cultivation, or cultivation on sandy
      soil, by utilizing their water-retaining ability.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0005] However, it has been recognized that the
      conventional polyacrylic acid-type hydrogels affect the growth of
      a plant, and particularly, they cause a marked inhibition of the
      root origination and root elongation when the hydrogels are used
      in an amount exceeding their appropriate amount (Kazuo Kawashima,
      et al., "Influences of Highly Water-Absorbing Polymer Materials on
      Initial Growth of Crops," Sand Dune Research, 31(1), 1-8, 1984).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0006] Particularly, when the conventional
      polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel is used as a support for tissue
      culture, a support for fluid seeding, and a support for virescence
      engineering, a plantlet, seed, etc., of a plant are caused to
      directly contact the high-concentration polyacrylic acid-type
      hydrogel, and therefore its root origination and root elongation
      are markedly inhibited, whereby the use of the polyacrylic
      acid-type hydrogel is severely restricted. It has also been
      recognized that, in a case where the conventional polyacrylic
      acid-type hydrogel is used as a water-retaining support for farm
      or field cultivation, the elongation of the root is inhibited when
      the concentration of the polymer in the vicinity of the root is
      increased so as to enhance the effect of the water-retaining
      support .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0007] As an example of the phenomenon such
      that the above-mentioned hydrogel comprising a polyacrylic
      acid-type resin markedly inhibits the growth of a plant, there has
      been reported an experiment wherein distilled water was absorbed
      into a crosslinked sodium polyacrylate so as to form a hydrogel,
      and the thus obtained hydrogel was caused to contact seeds of
      cucumbers and kidney beans for respective periods of time (3, 6,
      9, 12, 24 and 48 hours), and then the states of the germination
      and root origination of the seeds were observed (Kazuo Kawashima,
      et al., "Influences of Highly Water-Absorbing Polymer Materials on
      Initial Growth of Crops," Sand Dune Research, 31(1), 1-8, 1984).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0008] As a result of such experiments, it has
      been reported that the growth of roots was markedly suppressed in
      the case of cucumber seeds, when they are caused to contact the
      hydrogel for 36 to 48 hours, and that the inhibition of root
      growth was also observed similarly in the case of kidney beans.
      Further, it has been reported that the alpha
      -naphtylamine-oxidizing ability of the root was markedly reduced
      when the root is caused to contact the hydrogel for 5 hours or
      more. In this report, such growth inhibition and functional
      hindrance are presumably attributable to a fact that the plant
      cannot effectively use the water contained in the hydrogel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0009] On the other hand, it has been reported
      that, when rice seeds were sown on a hydrogel which had been
      prepared by causing crosslinked sodium polyacrylate to absorb
      water, and then the process of the root origination was observed,
      serious hindrance in the root origination was recognized (Yorio
      Sugimura, et al., "Utilization of Highly Water-Absorbing Polymer
      as Virescence Engineering Material," Techniques of Virescence
      Engineering, 9(2), 11-15, 1983). In this report, no hindrance in
      the root origination was observed when the hydrogel was dialyzed
      with tap water, but the recovery of the root growth was not
      observed even when the hydrogel was dialyzed with distilled water.
      In this report, it is presumed that, when the hydrogel is washed
      or dialyzed with a weak electrolytic solution such as tap water,
      the water-absorption amount force toward the hydrogel was
      weakened, and the migration of water from the gel to the root hair
      is facilitated, thereby to solve the hindrance in the root
      origination.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0010] It has also been reported an example
      wherein the elongation of soybean root was markedly inhibited in a
      soil which had been mixed with a crosslinked sodium polyacrylate
      hydrogel, as compared with that in the case of a polyvinyl
      alcohol-type hydrogel (Tomoko Nakanishi, Bioscience &amp;
      Industry, 52(8), 623-624, 1994). In this reference, this
      phenomenon is presumably attributable to a fact that the water in
      the sodium polyacrylate hydrogel is less liable to be utilized for
      a plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0011] As described above, it has heretofore
      been considered that the inhibition of the growth of a plant in a
      hydrogel comprising an alkali metal salt of crosslinked
      polyacrylic acid is attributable to a fact that the water in the
      hydrogel is not effectively utilized for the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0012] An object of the present invention is to
      provide a water-retaining support for plant which has solved the
      above-mentioned problems of the hydrogel water-retaining support
      encountered in the prior art.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0013] Another object of the present invention
      is to provide a water-retaining support for plant which has a
      water-retaining ability comparable to that of the conventional
      polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel, and does not substantially cause
      an inhibition in root origination or in root elongation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Disclosure of
        Invention</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0014] As a result of earnest study, the
      present inventors have found that the effect of a hydrogel is too
      strong to recognize that the inhibition of the root elongation is
      simply attributable to the effectiveness in the utilization of
      water in the hydrogel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0015] As a result of further study based on
      the above discovery, the present inventors have also found that
      the calcium ion-adsorbing ability in the hydrogel has an important
      effect on the inhibition of root origination or the inhibition of
      root elongation of a plant which is in contact with the hydrogel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0016] The water-retaining support for plant
      according to the present invention is based on the above
      discoveries and comprises a hydrogel-forming polymer having a
      calcium ion absorption of less than 50 mg per 1g of the dry weight
      thereof and having a water absorption magnification in
      ion-exchange water (at room temperature; 25 DEG C) of 100 or more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0017] Herein, the "water-retaining support "
      refers to one in a "dry state" unless otherwise noted
      specifically. As a matter of course, when such a support is
      distributed or circulated in an actual market, etc., the support
      may also be in a "hydrogel" state wherein a part or the entirety
      of the support retains water therein (the same as in the
      description appearing hereinafter).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0018] As a result of further study based on
      the above discovery, the present inventors have found that there
      is a case wherein the above-mentioned "calcium ion absorption
      (amount)" may greatly be affected by the content of carboxyl
      groups bonded to the polymer chain of the hydrogel-forming
      polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0019] The water-retaining support for plant
      according to the present invention is based on the above discovery
      and is one comprising a hydrogel-forming polymer having a carboxyl
      group bonded to the polymer chain thereof, and having a content of
      alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of the carboxyl group of 0.3 to
      2.5 mmol per 1g of the dry weight of the resin.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0020] According to the present inventors'
      experiments, it has been found that a preferred embodiment of such
      a hydrogel-forming polymer is one further containing a calcium
      salt of the carboxyl group.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0021] As a result of experiments as described
      hereinafter, the present inventors have found a fact that the
      conventional hydrogel comprising an "alkali metal salt of
      crosslinked polyacrylic acid" selectively adsorbs a heavy metal
      ion, mainly calcium ion. In other words, according to the present
      inventors' experiments, it is presumed that the conventional
      crosslinked polyacrylic acid-type hydrogel adsorbs ions (mainly
      comprising calcium ion) in agricultural water (such as well water,
      tap water, river water, and lake water) and the plant suffers from
      deficiency of calcium ion; or the hydrogel directly adsorbs ions
      (mainly comprising calcium ion) in the plant body from its roots,
      whereby the plant suffers from deficiency of calcium ion.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0022] The calcium ion is absorbed by a plant
      in a physicochemical manner. When the liquid surrounding the plant
      contains calcium ion in a low concentration, the calcium ion is
      not absorbed by the plant but the calcium ion is often eluted out
      of the plant. It is considered that, in the thus caused calcium
      ion deficiency, the structure of cell membrane is damaged or
      broken, so that many important functions dependent on the membrane
      structure, such as cell division, are stopped or retarded, whereby
      the elongation of root is markedly inhibited in appearance (with
      respect to the details of such deficiency of calcium ion, e.g.,
      "Outline of Plant Nutritional Science," edited by Kikuo Kumazawa,
      p. 118, Yokendo K.K., 1974, may be referred to).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0023] As shown in Table 1 in "Examples"
      appearing hereinafter, when the present inventors prepared various
      hydrogels respectively having different calcium-absorbing
      abilities and subjected the resultant hydrogels to root
      origination tests for seeds, marked growth inhibitions were
      observed with respect to the roots and stems thereof, when the
      calcium ion absorption became 50 mg or more per 1 g of the dry
      weight of the water-retaining support . Thus, according to the
      present inventors' knowledge, it is presumed that the marked
      growth inhibition caused by the conventional hydrogel comprising
      the metal salt of crosslinked polyacrylic acid is not attributable
      to the property of water in the hydrogel but is attributable to
      the calcium ion deficiency in the plant caused by the absorption
      of calcium ion from the plant by the hydrogel.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Best Mode for
        Carrying Out the Invention</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0025] Hereinbelow, the present invention will
      be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings
      as desired.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0026] In the following description, "%" and
      "part(s)" representing a quantitative proportion or ratio are
      those based on weight, unless otherwise noted specifically.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;(Water-Retaining Support)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0027] The water-retaining support according to
      the present invention comprises a hydrogel-forming polymer having
      a calcium ion absorption (amount) of less than 50 mg per 1g of the
      dry weight thereof, and having a water absorption magnification in
      ion-exchange water of 100 (times) or more. In the present
      invention, the above-mentioned "calcium ion absorption" and "water
      absorption magnification" in ion-exchange water may suitably be
      measured, e.g., by the following method.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Measurement
        of Calcium Ion Absorbing Amount)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0028] 1 g of a dried water-retaining support
      is added to 1 L (liter) of aqueous calcium chloride solution
      having a calcium ion concentration of 200 mg/L. Then, the
      resultant mixture is left standing for 2 days (48 hours) in a
      constant-temperature bath (or thermostatic chamber) at room
      temperature (25 DEG C) while the mixture is stirred occasionally,
      thereby to cause the water-retaining support to absorb calcium ion
      while being swollen. The thus swollen water-retaining support is
      separated from the supernatant, and the calcium ion concentration
      in the remaining supernatant (excess amount thereof in the
      above-mentioned aqueous calcium chloride solution) is
      quantitatively determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (A
      mg/L). On the basis of the thus determined value (A) of the
      calcium ion concentration, the calcium ion absorption amount per 1
      g of the water-retaining support is obtained by the following
      formula. At the time of the separation of the supernatant from the
      water-retaining support, there is a possibility that the
      non-crosslinked water-soluble polymer is dissolved in the
      supernatant, and therefore it is preferred to effect separation by
      ultrafiltration using an ultrafilter membrane which can
      fractionate the molecular weight of about 1,000 to 3,000.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calcium ion absorption amount per 1 g of
      water-retaining support (mg/g) = 200 - A<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0029] When the calcium ion absorption amount
      measured by the above-mentioned method is 50 mg or more per 1g of
      the dry weight of the water-retaining support , calcium ion
      deficiency is liable to occur in a plant which is in contact with
      the water-retaining support as shown in Example appearing
      hereinafter. The calcium ion absorption may preferably be 45 mg or
      less, more preferably 40 mg or less.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Measurement
        of Water Absorption Magnification in Ion-exchange Water)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0030] A predetermined amount (W1 g) of a dried
      water-retaining support is weighed, then is immersed in an excess
      amount (e.g., a weight which is at least 1.5 times the expected
      water-absorption amount of the above-mentioned water-retaining
      support ) of ion-exchange water (having an electric conductivity
      of 5 mu S/cm or less), and is then left standing in a
      constant-temperature bath at room temperature (25 DEG C) for 2
      days (48 hours) whereby the support is swollen. An excess amount
      of water is removed by filtration, and thereafter the weight (W2
      g) of the water-retaining support which has absorbed water to be
      swollen therewith is measured. Then, the water absorption
      magnification is determined by the following formula:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;water absorption magnification = (W2 - W1)/W1<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0031] If the water absorption magnification
      measured by the above-mentioned method is less than 100, it
      becomes difficult to sufficiently supply water to a plant when a
      predetermined amount of the water-retaining support is used. The
      water absorption magnification may preferably be 140 or more, more
      preferably 160 or more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0032] When the salt concentration is
      relatively low as in the case of agricultural water, the means for
      most effectively improving the water absorption magnification of a
      hydrogel is to introduce a dissociative ion group into the gel so
      as to expand the molecular chains in the gel and to simultaneously
      enhance the internal osmotic pressure in the gel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;(Hydrogel-forming polymer)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0033] The hydrogel-forming polymer
      constituting the water-retaining support according to the present
      invention refers to a polymer having a crosslinked or network
      structure, and has a property such that it retains water in the
      inside thereof on the basis of such a structure so as to form a
      hydrogel. Further, the "hydrogel" refers to a gel which at least
      comprise a crosslinked or network structure comprising a polymer,
      and water (as a dispersion liquid) retained by such a structure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0034] The "dispersion liquid" retained in the
      crosslinked or network structure is not particularly limited, as
      long as it is a liquid comprising water as a main or major
      component. More specifically, the dispersion liquid may for
      example be either of water per se, an aqueous solution and/or
      water-containing liquid (e.g., a mixture liquid of water and a
      monohydric or polyhydric alcohol).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0035] In the present invention, it is
      preferred to use a product obtained by crosslinking a
      water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer compound, as the
      above-mentioned hydrogel-forming polymer. Such a crosslinked
      polymer has a property such that it absorbs water in an aqueous
      solution to be swollen, but is not dissolved therein. The water
      absorption rate may be changed by changing the kind of the
      above-mentioned water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer and/or the
      density (or degree) of crosslinking thereof.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0036] When the aqueous solution of the
      above-mentioned hydrophilic polymer compound has a cloud point of
      70 DEG C or below, it is possible to obtain a hydrogel-forming
      polymer such that it shows a decrease in the water absorption
      magnification thereof along with an increase in a temperature
      range of not lower than 0 DEG C and not higher than 70 DEG C, and
      the water absorption magnification of the polymer is reversibly
      changeable with respect to temperature.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Water-soluble
        or hydrophilic polymer compound)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0037] Specific examples of the water-soluble
      or hydrophilic polymer constituting the water-retaining support
      according to the present invention may include: methyl cellulose,
      dextran, polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, polyvinyl
      alcohol, poly N-vinyl pyrrolidone, poly N-vinyl acetamide,
      polyvinyl pyridine, polyacrylamide, polymethacrylamide,
      poly-N-acryloyl piperidine, poly-N-n-propyl methacrylamide,
      poly-N-isopropyl acrylamide, poly-N,N-diethyl acrylamide,
      poly-N-isopropyl methacrylamide, poly-N-cyclopropyl acrylamide,
      poly-N-acryloyl pyrrolidine, poly-N,N-ethyl methyl acrylamide,
      poly-N-cyclopropyl methacrylamide, poly-N-ethyl acrylamide,
      poly-N-methyl acrylamide, polyhydroxymethyl acrylate, polyacrylic
      acid, polymethacrylic acid, polyvinylsulfonic acid,
      polystyrenesulfonic acid and their salts,
      poly-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate,
      poly-N,N-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate,
      poly-N,N-dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide, and their salts, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Crosslinking)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0038] As the method of imparting or
      introducing a crosslinked structure to a polymer, there are a
      method wherein a crosslinked structure is introduced into the
      polymer at the time of the polymerization of the monomer for
      providing the polymer; and a method wherein a crosslinked
      structure is introduced to a polymer after the completion of the
      polymerization of the monomer. Each of these methods may be used
      in the present invention.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0039] The former method (i.e., introduction of
      crosslinking at the time of monomer polymerization) may generally
      be conducted by utilizing the copolymerization with a bifunctional
      monomer (or a monomer having three or more functional groups). For
      example, such a method may be conducted by using a bifunctional
      monomer such as N,N-methylene bis-acrylamide, hydroxyethyl
      dimethacrylate, and divinylbenzene.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0040] The latter method (i.e., introduction of
      crosslinking after monomer polymerization) may generally be
      conducted by forming a crosslink between molecules by utilizing
      light, electron beam, gamma -ray irradiation, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0041] Further, the latter method may also be
      conducted by crosslinking a polymer, e.g., by using, as a
      crosslinking agent, a multi-functional molecule having a plurality
      of functional groups (such as isocyanate group) which is capable
      of being bonded to a functional group (such as amino group) in the
      polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0042] In the present invention, the
      above-mentioned water absorption rate of the hydrogel-forming
      polymer is dependent on the above-mentioned crosslinked structure,
      particularly the density of crosslinking of the polymer. In
      general, as the crosslinking density becomes lower, the water
      absorption rate tends to be increased.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0043] In the former method, the crosslinking
      density may arbitrarily be controlled, e.g., by changing the
      copolymerization ratio of the bifunctional monomer. In the latter
      method, the crosslinking density may arbitrarily be controlled,
      e.g., by changing the quantity of irradiation such as light,
      electron beam, and gamma -ray.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0044] In the present invention, the
      crosslinking density may preferably be in the range of about 0.02
      mol% to 10 mol%, more preferably about 0.05 mol% to 4 mol%, in
      terms of the ratio of the moles of the branching point to the
      moles of all the monomer. Alternatively, when the crosslinked
      structure is introduced by the former method (introduction of
      crosslinking at the time of polymerization), the crosslinking
      density may preferably be in the range of about 0.03 wt.% to 3
      wt.%, more preferably about 0.05 wt.% to 1.5 wt.%, in terms of the
      copolymerization weight ratio of the bifunctional monomer to all
      the monomers (inclusive of the bifunctional monomer per se).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0045] When the crosslinking density exceeds
      about 10 mol%, the water absorption magnification of the
      hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present invention is
      decreased, whereby the effect of the hydrogel-forming polymer as
      the water-retaining support is decreased. On the other hand, when
      the crosslinking density is below about 0.02 mol%, the
      hydrogel-forming polymer becomes mechanically weak, and the
      handling thereof becomes difficult.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0046] The crosslinking density (molar ratio of
      the branching points with respect to all the monomer) may be
      determined quantitatively, e.g., by &lt;13&gt;C-NMR (nuclear
      magnetic resonance absorption) measurement, IR (infrared
      absorption spectrum) measurement, or elemental analysis.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0047] Further, in the hydrogel-forming polymer
      constituting the water-retaining support according to the present
      invention, it is also possible to obtain a better balance between
      a high water absorption magnification and a high mechanical
      strength in the hydrogel-forming polymer by making the
      crosslinking density higher in the vicinity of the surface than
      that in the inside thereof (i.e., by introducing so-called
      "surface crosslinking"). In such an embodiment, the portion having
      a relatively high crosslinking density in the vicinity of the
      surface may mainly contribute to the high mechanical strength (and
      to an improvement in the non-stickiness between support
      particles), while the portion having a relatively low crosslinking
      density in the inside may mainly contribute to the high water
      absorption magnification. Thus, it becomes easy to realize a
      preferred mechanical strength and a preferred non-stickiness
      between the particles substantially without decreasing the water
      absorption magnification.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0048] In view of the balance between the water
      absorption magnification and mechanical strength, the ratio
      (Ds/Di) of the highest crosslinking density Ds in the vicinity of
      the surface to the lowest crosslinking density Di in the inside of
      the particle in the above-mentioned embodiment may preferably be
      about 2 to 5, more preferably about 5 to 10 (particularly, about
      10 to 100).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0049] The crosslinking density in the vicinity
      of the surface and that in the inside of the particle may be
      measured by determining the ratio of the presence of the
      crosslinking agent in the vicinity of the surface and that in the
      inside of the particle, e.g., according to a local analysis
      technique such as electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis ESCA
      (XPS), electron probe microanalysis EPMA, attenuated total
      reflection (ATR), or secondary ion mass spectrometry SIMS
      (time-of-flight SIMS (TOF-SIMS), etc.).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0050] In the water-retaining support for plant
      according to the present invention, when the hydrogel-forming
      polymer constituting the support has a high mechanical strength,
      it becomes easy to keep appropriate voids (or cavities) between
      the individual support particles, and the presence of the voids
      may further improve the capability of the support to supply oxygen
      to the root of a plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0051] In the present invention, the method of
      introducing the surface crosslinking to the hydrogel-forming
      polymer is not particularly restricted, and it is possible to use,
      e.g., various kinds of known methods (or a combination of two or
      more of such methods).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0052] Particularly, when the hydrogel-forming
      polymer in the present invention has a carboxyl group bonded to
      the polymer chain thereof, it is preferred to use a method wherein
      a crosslinking agent having at least two functional groups capable
      of reacting with the carboxyl group is used to crosslink a portion
      in the vicinity of the surfaces of fine polymer particles.
      Examples of such a crosslinking agent may include: epoxy compounds
      such as ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (JP-A (Japanese Laid-Open
      Patent Application No.) Sho 57-44627); polyhydric alcohols such as
      glycerin (JP-A Sho 58-180223); poly-(or polyvalent) amine
      compounds, poly-aziridine compounds, or poly-isocyanate compounds
      (JP-A Sho. 59-189103); poly-epoxy compounds having an amino group
      (JP-A Sho. 63-195205); a reaction product of epihalohydrin and a
      low-molecular primary amine such as ammonia or ethylene diamine
      (JP-A Hei 2-248404); poly-azithidinium base compounds (JP-A Hei
      6-287220), etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0053] When the molecular weight of the above
      crosslinking agent is low, the crosslinking agent is liable to
      penetrate into the inside of the hydrogel-forming polymer, and
      there is a case wherein the crosslinking has a strong tendency to
      reach the inside thereof without stopping at the vicinity of the
      surface. From such a viewpoint, the molecular weight of the
      crosslinking agent may preferably be at least 1,000, more
      preferably within the range of 10,000 to 100,000, in terms of
      weight-average molecular weight,.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0054] As the technique for crosslinking the
      surface of a hydrogel-forming polymer with the above crosslinking
      agent, it is possible to use a method wherein a hydrogel-forming
      polymer to be surface-crosslinked is dispersed in a large amount
      of a low-boiling point organic solvent such as alcohol, ketone and
      ether containing water, and then a crosslinking agent is added to
      the resultant mixture, thereby to effect crosslinking (JP-A Sho.

      a hydrogel-forming polymer having a carboxyl group bonded to the
      polymer chain thereof wherein the polymer chain is crosslinked,
      and the content of an alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of the
      carboxyl group is 0.3 to 2.5 mmol per 1g of the polymer. The
      content of the alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of carboxyl
      group may preferably be 0.5 to 2.0 mmol (particularly, 1.0 to 1.5
      mmol). Such a polymer having a carboxyl group may also preferably
      have the above-mentioned amount of residual organic material
      and/or the amount of carboxylic acid. The content of the alkali

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0060] 0.2 g of the dried water-retaining
      support is weighed in a platinum crucible, is subjected to ashing
      in an electric furnace, and thereafter the support is dissolved in
      5 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid. Then, distilled water is added to
      the resultant mixture so as to provide a total volume of 50 ml,
      and the cation concentration (D mM) therein is determined
      according to atomic absorption spectrometry. The content of
      carboxyl group salt in 1 g of the dried water-retaining support is
      calculated as D/4 (mmol).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0061] The conventional hydrogel comprising
      crosslinked product of an alkali metal salt of polyacrylic acid
      has a water absorption magnification which is markedly higher than
      that of a hydrogel comprising a crosslinked product of a nonionic
      hydrophilic polymer, and has been used as a water-retaining
      support in the agricultural field because of such a high water
      absorption magnification. However, according to the present
      inventor's experiments, in the hydrogel comprising the crosslinked
      product of the alkali metal salt of polyacrylic acid which has
      conventionally been developed as one to be used for agriculture,
      the content of the introduced dissociative ion groups is very high
      (e.g., the amount of the introduced alkali metal salt of acrylic
      acid is about 6 mmol or more per 1 g of the dried resin), whereby
      the hydrogel has a tendency such that it adsorbs heavy metal ions
      such as calcium ion which are essential for the growth of a plant,
      and it markedly inhibits the growth of the plant, as described
      above.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0062] In contrast thereto, according to the
      present inventors' experiments, it has been found that when 0.3 to
      2.5 mmol of a dissociative ion group (e.g., alkali metal salt or
      ammonium salt of carboxyl group) is introduced into a
      water-retaining support per 1 g of the dried support , the support
      shows a water-retaining effect (water absorption magnification in
      ion-exchange water of 100 or more) which is sufficient for growing
      a plant without causing deficiency of calcium ion in the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0063] Here, the alkali metal salt or ammonium
      salt is preferred as the dissociative ion group, and sodium salt
      or potassium salt is preferred as the alkali metal salt. In view
      of the effect on the plant, it is preferred to use a potassium
      salt or an ammonium salt which can be absorbed by the plant as an
      essential nutrient. When the content of the alkali metal salt of
      carboxyl group is less than 0.3 mmol per 1 g of the dried
      water-retaining support , it is difficult for the water-retaining
      support to have a water absorption magnification of 100 or more.
      On the other hand, when the content of alkali metal salt of
      carboxyl group exceeds 2.5 mmol, the calcium ion absorption is
      liable to become 50 mg or more per 1 g of the dried
      water-retaining support .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Monomer)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0064] The hydrogel-forming polymer may be
      obtained, e.g., by the ternary polymerization of a monomer (I)
      having an alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of carboxyl group, a
      hydrophilic monomer (II), and a crosslinking monomer (III).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0065] Specific examples of the monomer (I) may
      include alkali metal salts or ammonium salts of acrylic acid,
      methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, etc. These monomers
      may be either polymerized as a salt of monomer, or polymerized as
      a carboxylic acid monomer and then converted into a salt thereof
      by neutralization after the polymerization. However, the content
      thereof may preferably be set to 0.3 to 2.5 mmol per 1 g of the
      water-retaining support .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0066] Specific examples of the hydrophilic
      monomer (II) may include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic
      acid, itaconic acid, acrylamide, methacrylamide, N-vinylacetamide,
      etc. When a monomer containing a carboxylic acid is used as the
      hydrophilic monomer (II), the resultant hydrogel has a tendency to
      have a low pH value. Accordingly, in this case, the alkali metal
      salt or ammonium salt content of the carboxyl group may preferably
      be set to 1.0 to 2.5 mmol per 1 g.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0067] In such a case, it is also possible to
      convert a portion of the monomer containing the carboxylic acid
      into calcium salt so as to be copolymerized. According to the
      present inventors' investigation, it has been found that such a
      calcium salt-type monomer shows an effect of decreasing the
      calcium ion absorption of the water-retaining support , an effect
      of avoiding a decrease in pH, and further an effect of
      accelerating the polymerization.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0068] Specific examples of the crosslinking
      monomer (III) may include N,N'-methylene bis(meth)acrylamide,
      N,N'-ethylene bis(meth)acrylamide, ethylene glycol
      di(meth)acrylate, and diethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate, etc. The
      amount of the crosslinking monomer (III) to be used may generally
      preferably in the range of 0.01 to 5 mol%, more preferably in the
      range of 0.1 to 1 mol% with respect to all the monomers (while
      somewhat depending on the concentration for the polymerization).
      When the amount of the monomer to be used is less than 0.01 mol%,
      the strength of the water-retaining support tends to become
      insufficient. On the other hand, when the amount of the monomer to
      be used exceeds 5 mol%, it becomes difficult for the
      water-retaining support to have a water absorption magnification
      of 100 or more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0069] It is also possible to obtain the
      hydrogel-forming polymer by the saponification of a copolymer
      comprising vinyl acetate and maleic anhydride, a copolymer
      comprising vinyl acetate and acrylic acid (acrylate), etc. The
      thus obtained polymer compound is a polyvinyl alcohol-type
      polymer. When such a polymer is prepared so as to provide a
      content of alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of the carboxyl
      group bonded to the polymer of 0.3 to 2.5 mmol per 1g of the dry
      weight, it is possible to obtain a water-retaining support
      according to the present invention having a calcium ion absorption
      of less than 50 mg per 1 g of the water-retaining support and
      having a water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water of
      100 or more.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Treatment
        with Calcium Ion)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0070] The hydrogel-forming polymer may also be
      obtained by treating a commercially available polyacrylate-type
      highly water-absorbing resin with a strong acid or calcium ion. In
      general, in the commercially available polyacrylate-type highly
      water-absorbing resin, at least a half of the carboxyl groups
      bonded to the polymer chain are in the state of alkali metal
      salts, and the content thereof is at least about 6 mmol per 1 g of
      the resin. Therefore, the calcium ion absorption per 1 g of the
      resin becomes 120 mg or more, and therefore is inappropriate as
      the water-retaining support for a plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0071] In the present invention, when the
      hydrogel-forming polymer contains calcium salt of carboxyl group,
      the calcium salt content may preferably be at least 0.1 mmol (more
      preferably about 1.0 to 3.0 mmol) per 1g of the dry weight of the
      hydrogel-forming polymer. Such a content of the calcium salt of
      carboxyl group may preferably be measured, e.g., by the following
      method.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Measuring Content of Carboxyl Group Calcium Salt)</span><br

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0072] 0.2 g of the dried water-retaining
      support is weighed in a platinum crucible, is subjected to ashing
      in an electric furnace, and thereafter the support is dissolved in
      5 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid. Then, distilled water is added to
      the resultant mixture so as to provide a total volume of 50 ml,
      and the calcium concentration (E mM) therein is determined
      according to atomic absorption spectrometry. The content of
      carboxyl group calcium salt in 1 g of the dried water-retaining
      support is calculated as E/2 (mmol).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0073] When a strong acid such as hydrochloric
      acid, nitric acid and sulfuric acid, or an aqueous calcium ion
      solution such as calcium chloride solution and calcium nitrate
      solution is added to such a commercially available
      polyacrylate-type highly water-absorbing resin, the alkali metal
      salt of carboxyl group in the highly water-absorbing resin is
      substituted by carboxylic acid or calcium salt of carboxyl group.
      Therefore, when the amount of the strong acid or calcium ion to be
      added is appropriately set, the content of alkali metal salt of
      the carboxyl group bonded to the polymer may be adjusted to 0.3 to
      2.5 mmol per 1 g of the dried water-retaining support , thereby to
      provide a water-retaining support for plant according to the
      present invention having a calcium ion absorption of less than 50
      mg per 1g of the dry weight and having a water absorption
      magnification in ion-exchange water of 100 or more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0074] Here, when the carboxyl group is
      substituting by carboxylic acid, the resultant hydrogel has a
      strong tendency to become acidic. Accordingly, particularly in
      this case, the content of alkali metal salt of carboxyl group may
      preferably be adjusted to be 1.0 to 2.5 mmol per 1 g of the dried
      water-retaining support .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(pH of
        Water-Retaining support for Plant)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0075] The pH (hydrogen ion concentration) of
      conventional water-retaining supports for plant containing a
      hydrogel-forming polymer ranges from neutral to weakly alkaline.
      According to the present inventors' knowledge, it is presumed that
      such a phenomenon is attributable to the reaction condition etc.,
      at the time of the synthesis of polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0076] In contrast, the present inventors have
      found that, even in a water-retaining support containing a
      hydrogel-forming polymer, in general, the pH thereof may
      preferably be weakly acidic so as to provide an environment
      suitable for the growth of a plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0077] In general, in the case of a hydrogel
      comprising a polymer having a carboxyl group, it has a tendency
      such that the amount of the calcium absorption of the polymer is
      decreased as the hydrogen ion concentration in the polymer
      composition becomes higher (becomes more acidic). Consequently,
      also in view of the suppression of the adverse effect of the
      calcium ion absorption of the polymer on a plant, it is preferred
      that the pH of the water-retaining support for plant according to
      the present invention is in a weakly acidic range.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0078] Further, the hydrogel comprising a
      polymer having a carboxyl group usually has a buffer effect as
      well, and therefore the hydrogel comprising a polymer having a
      carboxyl group is advantageous to the retention of a pH value
      suitable for plant growth, also in view of the buffer effect.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0079] In general, the pH of the
      water-retaining support for plant may preferably be about pH 3 to
      6.5 (more preferably about pH 4 to 6), though it may somewhat vary
      depending on the kind of a plant. Particularly, since the culture
      liquid for tissue culture is generally adjusted to pH 5.7 to 5.8,
      the pH of the hydrogel may preferably be 5.7 to 5.8.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0080] In order to decrease the
      calcium-absorption, it is sufficient to make the portion of the
      carboxylic acid type in the carboxyl group larger than that of the
      alkali metal or ammonium salt-type thereof. However, when the
      portion of this acid type is too large, the pH of a
      water-retaining agent may tend to become too low or the swelling
      ratio of the water-retaining agent may tend to decrease. It is
      possible to obviate or diminish the demerit of a decrease in the
      pH or swelling ratio as described above by increasing the ratio of
      the calcium salt in the carboxyl group or decreasing the carboxyl
      group content (increasing the nonionic portion) in the polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Culturing Plant Using Hydrogel-Forming Polymer)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0081] Heretofore, an agar gel has generally
      been used as a support for tissue culture. However, in this case,
      a root is grown therein in a state where water is excessive and
      voids are little present, and therefore the root is elongated in a
      form which is different from that of the root grown in a farm
      cultivation step, whereby it is impossible to acclimate the root
      in the inside of the culture vessel. In addition, once an agar gel
      discharges the water content through the evaporation thereof or
      absorption thereof by a plant, the gel hardly absorbs water
      content again. Accordingly, the agar gel does not absorb the water
      constituting dew drops or the water once released from the gel in
      the vessel, whereby the acclimation of the root is adversely
      affected in some cases.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0082] According to the present inventors'
      knowledge, it is presumed that such a problem of the agar gel is
      attributable to a fact that agar does not absorb further water
      after it is converted into a gel state, that agar does not absorb
      water again after it releases water and that it retains water only
      with a weak attracting force. In the present invention, such a
      water-retaining ability of the gel may be represented, e.g., by a
      pF value.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0083] Here, the pF value (Potential of Free
      Energy: water absorption pressure) is a value representing the
      water-retaining ability of support. With respect to the details
      thereof, e.g., "Introduction to Soil" (Yasuo Takai and Hiroshi
      Miyoshi, Asakura Shoten, 1977, pp. 88-89) can be referred to.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0084] In the present invention, the water
      which is absorbable by a plant may preferably be one having a pF
      value not higher than a capillary connection breaking point (pF
      value of about 2.8). Further, the pF value may preferably be not
      higher than 2.3 so that a plant is preferably grown in farm
      cultivation. The water having a pF value of 1.8 or less
      (gravitational water) can be absorbed by a plant, but it tends to
      flow out from a vessel having an open-type basement portion. In
      the case of a vessel having a closed-type or closed-like basement,
      the gravitational water may reside in the support at the basement
      of the vessel, thereby to cause root decay in some cases. In
      general tissue culture for a useful plant, the vessel is formed
      into a close system, and an agar gel is used as a support
      therefor, whereby the pF value during the culturing period of time
      becomes substantially almost zero.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0085] On the other hand, when a
      hydrogel-forming polymer does not reach its equilibrium water
      absorption, the polymer tends to absorb water surrounding gel
      particles. In the present invention, when a hydrogel-forming
      polymer is used as a culturing support, the water contained in the
      gel is gradually decreased (pF value thereof is increased) due to
      the evaporation of water toward the outside of the vessel during
      the culturing process and the water absorption accompanying the
      growth of a plant, whereby the acclimation to water stress may be
      automatically effected during the culturing process. In addition,
      when the hydrogel-forming polymer is in form of a gel particle,
      the voids which are present outside of the gel particles are
      widened along with an increase in the pF value, whereby the amount
      of oxygen supply may be increased along with the growth of the
      plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0086] Further, when the hydrogel-forming
      polymer is used in the present invention, the water in the form of
      dew drops in a vessel or the water separated from the polymer gel
      (which often adversely affects the acclimation of root) can also
      be absorbed by the hydrogel-forming polymer. Therefore, when the
      hydrogel-forming polymer is used as a support, the root may
      automatically be acclimated in a culturing step along with the
      growth of a plant, whereby the plant may favorably be grown even
      after the transferring thereof into a farm cultivation step.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0087] Another advantage to be obtained in a
      case using a hydrogel-forming polymer as a support for tissue
      culture is that the space in the vessel may fully be utilized. The
      physical environment in a plant support can be divided or
      classified into three phases including a liquid phase, a gaseous
      phase, and a solid phase, and the hydrogel-forming polymer
      functions as both of the liquid and solid phases, thereby to
      secure a large amount of nutrient and water per unit volume.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0088] Still another advantage to be obtained
      in a case using the hydrogel-forming polymer as a support for
      tissue culture is that additional culture liquid may easily be
      added to the support in the course of the culturing. In this case,
      the hydrogel-forming polymer may be caused to absorb the thus
      supplied culture liquid without sinking the plant in the culture
      liquid.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Voids in
        Support Comprising Hydrogel-Forming Polymer)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0089] When the strength of the
      hydrogel-forming polymer is low, the resultant gel tends to be
      deformed, thereby to reduce the voids among the gel particles.
      Therefore, it is possible to secure the voids by mixing a porous
      material such as pearlite with the gel. It is also possible to
      form voids among the gel particles, by increasing the strength of
      the hydrogel-forming polymer. For the purpose of enhancing the gel
      strength, it is possible to increase the crosslinking density or
      impart surface crosslinking to the gel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0090] In this case, known materials such as
      pearlite, bark, sponge, and sphagnum may be used without any
      particular restriction. In view of more effective exhibition of a
      bacteriostatic or fungistatic property (see Japanese Patent
      Application No. 6-139140; and PCT/JP95/01223) which is a
      characteristic of the hydrogel-forming polymer, it is preferred to
      use an inorganic porous material such as pearlite, as compared
      with the use of a natural organic matter which is decayable.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Utilizing Hydrogel-Forming Polymer in Suspension Culture)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0091] The hydrogel-forming polymer is also
      preferably usable in liquid culture (or suspension culture). In
      the conventional liquid culture, there have been posed problems
      such as the collision of cell agglomerates with the wall surface
      or collision between the cell agglomerates at the time when
      plantlets are being stirred during the liquid culture; and a
      decrease in the growth (or multiplication) rate of plant cells
      caused by a browning material produced by the cells due to the
      above physical damage.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0092] In contrast, in the present invention,
      when hydrogel-forming polymer particles are mixed into a
      suspension culture system in an extent wherein a liquid state can
      be maintained, the gel particles may act as a cushion, thereby to
      suppress the production of the browning material, to enhance the
      growth rate, and to enlarge the cell agglomerate.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0093] The ratio of the volume of the hydrogel
      to that of the liquid may preferably be 0.5 to 90 %, more
      preferably 1 to 60 %, and particularly preferably 5 to 40 %.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0094] Examples of the suspension culture may
      include the rotary shake culture with Erlenmeyer flasks, fermenter
      culture, large-size tank culture, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">(Seed
        Germination and Germination Activity Test)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0095] In order to evaluate the effect of a
      water-retaining support upon a plant, it is preferred to conduct a
      germination and germination activity test for a seed by using, as
      a culture medium, the water-retaining support (hydrogel) which has
      absorbed agricultural water therein. For example, seeds of white
      radish sprouts (e.g., those sold by Takii Shubyo K.K.) which may
      easily be subjected to short-term germination and germination
      activity test may be used as a seed material, and synthetic water
      having a typical underground water composition (Table 2) may be
      used as the agricultural water in the above-mentioned test.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0096] For example, the seed germination and
      germination activity test may be performed in the following
      manner.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0097] 16 ml of the above-mentioned synthetic
      water and 160 mg (1 wt. %) of each kind of water-retaining support
      are introduced into a test tube (having a diameter of 2.5 cm and a
      height of 15 cm), and the resultant mixture is fully stirred, and
      then the mixture is left standing for 30 minutes at 25 DEG C,
      thereby to prepare a gel-like culture medium comprising the
      water-retaining support which has absorbed the agricultural water
      therein. 5 grains of the above-mentioned seed of white radish
      sprouts are uniformly put on the surface of the gel-like culture
      medium in each of test tubes, and the test tube is capped with a
      silicone plug having a 6-mm diameter hole filled with cotton. The
      thus capped test tube is cultured for 4 days in a culture room (25
      DEG C, illumination intensity of 2000 Lux, 16h-daytime), and the
      ratio of germination (number of germinated seeds/5 (grains) x
      100(%)) is investigated.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0098] In the above-mentioned germination and
      germination activity test, the case wherein the seed coat is torn
      and the cotyledon unfolds is defined as the occurrence of
      germination, and the other cases are defined as no occurrence of
      germination. The length of the above-ground portion is measured as
      the average stem and leaf length from the base portion (branching
      point between the root and stem) of the germinated individual to
      its leaf tip, while the length of the underground portion is
      measured as the average root length from the base portion of the
      germinated individual to the tip of its main root. Further, the
      appearance of the root tip, etc., is observed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Using Water-Retaining support )</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0099] The water-retaining support according to
      the present invention may be used either singly or in combination
      with another plant-growing support as desired. The kind, ratio of
      amount to be used, etc., of the other plant-growing support are
      not particularly restricted. Preferred examples of the other
      plant-growing support may include: soil or gravel, sand, pumice,
      carbide, peat, vermiculite, bark, pearlite, zeolite, rock wool,
      sponge, sphagnum, crushed coconut shell, crypto-moss, etc. Each of
      these plant-growing supports may be used either singly or in a
      combination of two or more species thereof, as desired.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0100] When a plant is grown by using the
      water-retaining support according to the present invention, the
      water-retaining support according to the present invention
      comprising a hydrogel or polymer may preferably be mixed with the
      above-mentioned other plant-growing support comprising soil, etc.,
      at a mixing ratio of about 0.1 to 10 wt. % (more preferably about
      0.3 to 3 wt. %) in terms of weight percent in a dried state.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0101] When the water-retaining support
      according to the present invention and the other plant-growing
      support are used in combination, they may be used as the
      above-mentioned mixture, and may also be used in an embodiment
      wherein at least one layer comprising the water-retaining support
      according to the present invention may be disposed on the surface
      of and/or in the inside of the other plant-growing support .<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Cultivating Plant Using Hydrogel-Forming Polymer)</span><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0102] In the conventional cultivation using an
      open-type vessel (such as pot, cell tray, and planter), the
      amounts of water and the nutrient concentration are drastically
      changed before and after the watering, whereby it is difficult to
      control water. Immediately before the watering, the obstruction to
      the root due to the high concentration of the fertilizer in the
      soil caused by drying becomes problematic, and the wilting of a
      plant due to the shortage of water becomes problematic. On the
      other hand, immediately after the watering, the residence or
      retention of excess water in the pot, and the root decay due to
      the shortage of oxygen become problematic. Particularly, in view
      of the extreme increase in the fertilizer concentration
      immediately before the watering, it is necessary to set the
      absolute amount of the fertilizer to a low level so as to avoid
      the extreme increase thereof, and such a low level may cause the
      suppression of the inherent growth of the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0103] The production of plantlets with a
      cell-type partition such as vegetables for which the demand has
      drastically been increasing in recent years, also holds the
      above-mentioned problem. In the case of such plantlets with a
      cell-type partition, since each cell or division has a relatively
      small volume, and therefore the nutrient concentration and water
      content are liable to be changed drastically, thereby to make it
      difficult to uniformly control the individual cells.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0104] In the present invention, such a problem
      of the physical environment around the plant root may be
      represented by the above-mentioned pF value (water absorption
      pressure). A plant may absorb water having a pF value of about 2.8
      or less, but water having a pF value of 2.3 or less is preferred
      in view of favorable growth of a plant. Water having a pF value of
      1.8 or less can be absorbed by a plant, but it is gravitational
      water and has a strong possibility of flowing out of the
      rhizosphere (or zone under the influence of the root). On the
      other hand, when the drainage of the rhizosphere is poor, the
      water may reside around the root, thereby to cause the root decay.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0105] According to the present inventors'
      knowledge, it is presumed that the root of a plant which has been
      cultured by the conventional method is not acclimated, and the new
      support (such as bark) to be used in the step of farm cultivation
      and the root do not sufficiently fit with each other (the contact
      area therebetween is small), whereby the absorption of the
      nutrient and water necessary for the initial growth of the plant
      is insufficient. According to the present inventors, it is also
      presumed that the decrease in the germination ratio of seeds and
      the growth inhibition after the germination are caused by the
      small contact area between the support and the seed or the root
      after the germination. When a cultured plantlet with a root is
      transferred to farm cultivation, the conventionally used support
      is too hard or does not have a fluidity, thereby to damage the
      root. In addition, when the conventional support is used, it is
      impossible to use the insertion transplantation technique.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0106] On the other hand, when the
      hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present invention is
      used, a large amount of water may be secured per unit volume,
      whereby the range of fluctuation in the nutrient concentration in
      a vessel becomes small and the inhibition of plant elongation is
      dramatically decreased. Further, since the hydrogel-forming
      polymer according to the present invention may completely absorb
      an excess of water, the root is less liable to decay, and the
      control of the nutrient and water becomes easier. Particularly,
      since the range of fluctuation in the nutrient concentration
      before and after the watering is decreased, the absolute amount of
      a fertilizer may be increased drastically, thereby to further
      accelerate the growth of the plant. Therefore, according to the
      present invention, it becomes easy to uniformly control the
      individual cells even in the case of the production of the
      plantlets with a cell-type partition wherein the vessel has a
      relatively small volume.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0107] In addition, a plant immediately after
      the transplanting, a seed, and a root after germination may more
      easily fit with the hydrogel-forming polymer (the contact area
      therebetween is increased), thereby to smoothly conduct the
      initial growth of the plant. Further, since the hydrogel
      comprising the hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present
      invention is relatively soft and has a good fluidity, a root may
      be transplanted therein without being damaged. Due to such a
      characteristic of the hydrogel, the insertion transplantation
      becomes easier. While such genera of orchids as Phalaenopsis and
      Cymbidium, particularly, have thick roots with substantially no
      root hair, the present invention makes it very easy to transplant
      such plant species as well.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Preventing Flowing-out of Support)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0108] When a vessel is one having an open-type
      basement, it is important to prevent the flowing-out of a support
      (such as hydrogel and planting material including the hydrogel)
      due to watering, etc. As the means for preventing such
      flowing-out, it is effective to enlarge the particles of the
      hydrogel-forming polymer or increase the stickiness thereof. As a
      method of increasing the stickiness, it is possible to use a
      method of reducing the crosslinking density of the
      hydrogel-forming polymer, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Suppressing Rising of Plant)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0109] In the case of a plant species with a
      thick and strong root, when the root elongates and reaches the
      bottom face of a vessel, the plant may be lifted up to the upper
      portion of the vessel (so-called "rising" phenomenon). As the
      means of preventing such a phenomenon, it is effective to increase
      the stickiness of the hydrogel-forming polymer. As the method of
      increasing the stickiness, it is possible to use a method of
      reducing the crosslinking density of the hydrogel-forming polymer,
      etc..<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0110] Heretofore, in a so-called "plant
      factory" (plant-growing system under an artificial environment
      other than the natural environment such as field cultivation),
      cultivation using mist, cultivation using capillary watering,
      etc., have been effected, and these methods have required an
      enormous amount of investment for the watering equipment.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0111] When the hydrogel-forming polymer
      according to the present invention is used as a plant support or
      water-supplying medium for such a "plant factory," the watering
      equipment is simplified, thereby to simplify the plant-growing
      system and reduce the costs therefor.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;(Field
        Cultivation)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0112] The conventional field cultivation has
      been encountered with problems similar to those in the
      conventional cultivation using a vessel. That is, the field
      cultivation is affected by conditions of nature, and therefore the
      nutrient concentration, water content, and pF value are
      drastically changed before and after rainfall, thereby to make it
      difficult to cultivate the plant. Particularly, areas with less
      rainfall have often been encountered with damages such as drought.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0113] In contrast, when the hydrogel-forming
      polymer according to the present invention is used for the field
      cultivation, since the hydrogel-forming polymer functions as a
      buffer against the drastic fluctuations in the nutrient
      concentration, water content, and pF value, etc., as described
      above, the plant may be cultivated under a milder condition.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Virescence
        Technology)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0114] with respect to the virescence (or
      greening) of desert, virescence of slopes, virescence of wall
      surfaces, etc., since the basic support is sand, soil or clay
      wall, concrete, etc., the amount of water retained therein is very
      small, and the water-retaining ability thereof is very poor. For
      the purpose of smoothly effecting the initial stage of plant
      growth or seed germination from such a state, it is quite
      effective to use the hydrogel-forming polymer according to the
      present invention having a very great water-retaining ability and
      acting as a buffer against the drastic fluctuations of the
      nutrient concentration, water content, pF value, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0115] For the virescence of slope, it is
      possible to sow seeds for virescence by a fluid seeding method
      using the hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present
      invention in the same manner as in the technique for spraying a
      concrete material onto a slope. Particularly, in the case of the
      virescence of a slope or non-flat hillside wherein rocks, etc.,
      are exposed to the ground surface thereof, the attachment ratio of
      a net and seeds onto the slope tends to become lower when a
      technique such as net seeding is used. When the fluid seeding
      method for virescence seed using the hydrogel-forming polymer
      according to the present invention is used, the seeds contained in
      the hydrogel may uniformly be sprayed onto a slope, and the
      attachment ratio of the hydrogel and the seeds contained therein
      with respect to the slope is increased, thereby to enhance the
      germination rate of the seeds and accelerate the growth of the
      plant after the germination.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(Spatial
        Cultivation)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0116] An epiphyte such as Vanda, which is a
      genus of orchid family plant, is attached to a tree, etc., in a
      natural state, while hanging down its roots into a space, thereby
      to absorb water of fog, rain, etc. When such a plant species is
      artificially cultivated in a space, it is necessary to increase
      the frequency of watering so as to prevent drying. In such a case,
      when the epiphyte is cultivated while covering the periphery of
      the roots thereof with the hydrogel-forming polymer according to
      the present invention, the drying thereof may be prevented for a
      long period of time, and the frequency of the watering may be
      reduced.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(Spatial
        Floating Cultivation under Weightlessness)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0117] With the advent of the age of population
      growth and food shortage, plant cultivation in the outer space has
      been under investigation. Since the outer space is weightless,
      when a plant support mainly comprising a hydrogel-forming polymer
      is floated in a weightless space such as a space station, and the
      support is planted with a plant so as to cultivate the plant,
      three-dimensional cultivation can be conducted, thereby to
      drastically increase the plant production per unit volume.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Transplanting Plant)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0118] When a plant is transplanted together
      with the hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present
      invention attached to its roots, the initial drying may be
      prevented, thereby to increase the ratio of taking root and to
      enhance the initial growth of the plant. Such a transplanting
      method is particularly effective in transplanting plantlets of
      flower and vegetable, and woody plantlets, transplanting turf,
      moving adult trees, etc.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0119] A hydrogel-forming polymer comprising a

      Therefore, calcium is added to a gel to shrink the gel, and the
      sugar in the gel is removed by decantation, washing with water,
      etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) When a large amount of water is present
      around a plant such as plantlet at the time of its shipping, the
      root would be damaged during the transportation. Further, the
      large amount of water makes the goods heavier, thereby to increase
      the cost of the transportation. For the purpose of preventing
      these problems, calcium is added to a gel so as to shrink the gel,
      thereby to remove the water in the gel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) In order to increase the contact area
      between a new support and roots when a plant is transplanted,
      calcium is added to a gel so as to shrink the gel, and thereafter
      the new support is disposed around the roots thereby to smoothly
      effect the transplantation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) When a plant grown in a vessel is
      transplanted, calcium is added to the gel so as to shrink the gel
      and to reduce its volume, and water is released from the gel,
      thereby to facilitate the removal of the plant from the vessel.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        Suppressing Propagation of Algae, etc.)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0120] Since algae which have been propagated
      in the upper portion of a pot, etc., absorbs a nutrient supplied
      to a plant for the purpose of growing the plant, it is desirable
      to suppress the propagation of such algae as firm as possible.
      Examples of the suppressing method usable in this case are as
      follows:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) Covering the surface of the water-retaining
      support for plant with a light-shielding sheet such as aluminum.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) Sprinkling the surface of the
      water-retaining support for plant with light-shielding activated
      charcoal.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) Blackening the hydrogel-forming polymer
      itself by using a pigment, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Additives)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0121] In the crosslinked structure of the
      hydrogel-forming polymer constituting the plant-cultivating
      support, soil-improving agent, vessel or sheet according to the
      present invention, at least water is retained as desired, so as to
      form a hydrogel. Further, it is also possible to add another
      additive to the hydrogel as desired. As the additive to be
      incorporated into the inside of the hydrogel or polymer for such a
      purpose, it is possible to use known additives which may
      ordinarily be used in the usual plant cultivation in open-air
      field or facilities (such as greenhouse) without particular
      limitation.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0122] Specific examples of such a known
      additive may include: various nutrients for a plant, agents
      participating in the cultivation of a plant other than the
      nutrients (such as plant growth-regulating substance, plant form
      (or shape)-regulating substance including a dwarfing agent) or
      agricultural chemicals (such as weed killer, insecticide, and
      bactericide).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;(Nutrient)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0123] Specific examples of the nutrient which
      may be introduced, as desired, into the inside of the hydrogel or
      hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present invention may
      include major elements such as N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S and/or minor
      elements such as Fe, Cu, Mn, Zn, Mo, B, Cl and Si.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0124] As the method of incorporating such a
      nutrient into the hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer, it is
      possible to use a method wherein the above hydrogel or
      hydrogel-forming polymer itself is immersed in an aqueous solution
      containing a substance such as urea, calcium nitrate, potassium
      nitrate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and
      ferrous sulfate to be swollen, thereby to cause the resultant
      hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer to absorb thereinto the
      desired nutrient.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;(Plant-growth
        regulating substance, etc.)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0125] It is also possible to incorporate into
      the above-mentioned hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer the
      above-mentioned plant growth-regulating substance, plant
      form-regulating, etc., or agricultural chemicals (such as weed
      killer, insecticide, and bactericide) as desired, which is a
      substance participating in the cultivation of the plant other than
      the above-mentioned nutrients.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        incorporating additive)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0126] As the method of incorporating one of
      the above various additives into the inside of the hydrogel or
      hydrogel-forming polymer, it is possible to use a method wherein
      the hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer is immersed in an aqueous
      solution of the additive so that the hydrogel or polymer is caused
      to absorb the above aqueous solution, thereby to prepare a
      hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer. Further, when a plant
      form-regulating substance (dwarfing agent) such as inabenfide or
      uniconazole which has a very low solubility in water is used, it
      is also possible to incorporate the plant form-regulating
      substance into the inside of the hydrogel or hydrogel-forming
      polymer by using an organic solvent which is capable of dissolving
      the plant form-regulating substance and is capable of swelling the
      hydrogel or polymer, whereby the plant form-regulating substance
      may be incorporated into the inside of the hydrogel or polymer in
      a practically usable concentration.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Plant Growth
        in Semi-closed Ecosystem)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0127] In the natural world, there works a
      material circulation ecosystem wherein plants perform
      photosynthesis, animals eat the plant, microorganisms decompose
      the excrements of animals and the corpses of animals and plant,
      and the plants absorb the resultant decomposition products as
      nutrients. On the other hand, the crop cultivation consuming a
      large amount of chemical fertilizers, agricultural chemicals,
      etc., may be called a semi-closed ecosystem since the
      material-circulating function of organisms is suppressed therein.
      The clonal plantlet production by aseptic culture and the
      vegetable production in plant factories, which have recently been
      commercialized, may be called a closed ecosystem since they block
      up the microorganism phase. It is expected that the plant
      cultivation in a closed ecosystem which is independent of
      fluctuations in the natural environment and may be artificially
      controlled, further magnifies its importance in the future.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0128] By utilizing the bacteriostatic action
      of the hydrogel-forming polymer (see PCT/JP95/01223), the present
      invention enables plant production in a semi-closed ecosystem
      wherein a plant is cultivated while the material circulation
      caused by the microorganic decomposition is suppressed. This
      method has a merit such that not only the propagation of germs
      such as pathogenic microbes capable of preventing the growth of a
      plant may be suppressed, but also the oxygen consumption due to
      microorganisms in the support is decreased, thereby to secure a
      large absolute amount of oxygen which may be absorbed by the root
      of the plant. Further, the microorganism phase may be simplified,
      such that a plant is grown while only the microorganisms effective
      for the plant (e.g., vasicular arbuscular mycorrhiza) are
      propagated.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0129] With the advent of the age of population
      growth and food shortage, the plant production in the outer space
      has become very important, and the plant production in a closed
      ecosystem excluding or simplifying the microorganism phase would
      prevail in spaces such as space stations. Even in the plant
      cultivation in such an outer space, the hydrogel-forming polymer
      according to the present invention may preferably be used as a
      support for plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;(Plant
        Cultivation in Home)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0130] In order to cultivate a plant in a home,
      it is particularly important that the vessel containing a support
      may be maintained in a clean state and that nutrients and water
      may be supplied easily. Since the hydrogel-forming polymer
      attached to the vessel according to the present invention has a
      bacteriostatic action (see PCT/JP95/01223), it may easily maintain
      a clean state. Further, since the polymer may retain a large
      amount of nutrients and water, the frequency of watering may be
      reduced, and appropriate nutrient concentration, water content, pF
      value, etc., may be maintained for a long period of time. It is
      also possible to place a plant body such as seed in this vessel
      from the beginning advance.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp;(Plant-Growing
        Vessel/Sheet)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0131] Hereinbelow, there is described an
      embodiment wherein the hydrogel-forming polymer according to the
      present invention is applied to a plant-growing vessel or sheet.
      Such a growing vessel or sheet may preferably be used for the
      germination of a seed or growth thereof after the germination
      (hereinafter, the term "growth" is used in a meaning such that it
      also includes germination and growth after the germination) in
      tissue culture or farm cultivation, and for the growth of a plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0132] In this embodiment, the transplanting
      operation for a plant (hereinafter, the term "plant" is used in a
      meaning such that it also includes "seed") may easily be effected,
      the germination or growth of the plant may be accelerated, and the
      necessity for strict water control, etc., may greatly be
      alleviated.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0133] The plant-growing vessel in such an
      embodiment comprises a vessel-shaped substrate which is capable of
      accommodating therein at least a portion of a plant; and a
      hydrogel-forming polymer disposed in the inside of the
      vessel-shaped substrate, which has a crosslinked structure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0134] Further, the plant-growing sheet in such
      an embodiment comprises a sheet-shaped substrate; and a
      hydrogel-forming polymer disposed on at least one side of the
      surface of the substrate, which has a crosslinked structure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0135] In the above-mentioned vessel or sheet
      according to the present invention, the hydrogel-forming polymer
      having a crosslinked structure may preferably be a polymer which
      shows a decrease in water absorption magnification along with an
      increase in temperature within a temperature range of not lower
      than 0 DEG C and not higher than 70 DEG C, and exhibits a water
      absorption magnification which is reversibly changeable with
      respect to temperature.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0136] Further, in the present invention, when
      the above hydrogel-forming polymer is in the form of powder or
      particles, the powder or particles may preferably have a dimension
      or size of about 0.1 mu m to 5 mm in a dry state thereof.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> &nbsp;(Function of
        Vessel or Sheet)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0137] When the plant-growing vessel or sheet
      according to the present invention is used, the above-mentioned
      problem encountered in the prior art may be solved on the basis of
      the function peculiar to the vessel or sheet according to the
      present invention as described hereinbelow.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0138] More specifically, a polymer capable of
      providing a hydrogel having a crosslinked structure is disposed on
      the inner wall of the plant-growing vessel according to the
      present invention (or on the side of the sheet according to the
      present invention, on which a plant is to be disposed, when such a
      sheet is disposed on the inner wall of another vessel) by coating,
      etc. Accordingly, when a plant is put into the vessel and then the
      vessel is filled with water or a suspension culture medium, the
      above-mentioned hydrogel-forming polymer absorbs water so that the
      volume thereof is increased remarkably, and occupies the inner
      space of the vessel, whereby the polymer functions as at least a
      part of the support for the plant (in other words, the
      hydrogel-forming polymer functions as such a support, or promotes
      the function for supporting the plant).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0139] In the present invention, on the basis
      of the function peculiar to the above-mentioned which is capable
      of providing a hydrogel and has a crosslinked structure, the
      problems encountered in the prior art at the time of the
      transplanting of a plant are solved. More specifically, such
      problems to be solved may include: one such that when a plant is
      transferred into a vessel after the vessel is filled with a solid
      plant support in advance, the root of the plant does not enter the
      inside of the support well, and therefore the resultant
      workability is decreased, and the root per se is also damaged; one
      such that when a plant is put into a vessel and then the
      conventional solid plant support is charged into the vessel, the
      resultant initial growth is decreased due to a small contact area
      between the root of the plant and the support ; etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0140] In addition, in an embodiment of the
      present invention wherein the hydrogel-forming polymer to be
      disposed on the inner wall of the vessel by coating comprises a
      hydrogel-forming polymer wherein the water absorption
      magnification is decreased along with an increase in temperature
      in the temperature range of not lower than 0 DEG C and not higher
      than 70 DEG C, and the change in the water absorption
      magnification is reversible with respect to temperature, for
      example, it is possible that a plant is put into such a vessel,
      water or a suspension culture medium is poured into the vessel so
      that the polymer is caused to absorb water, whereby the polymer is
      swollen so as to occupy the inner space of the vessel and the
      plant is grown by using the hydrogel-forming polymer as (at least
      a part of) the support of the plant. After the plant is grown,
      when the temperature of the support is elevated, the
      hydrogel-forming polymer is de-swelled (or shrunk) so as to
      markedly decrease its volume, and therefore the grown plant may
      easily be removed from the vessel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0141] Accordingly, the present invention
      solves the above-mentioned problems encountered in the prior art,
      i.e., one such that since the thickly grown root presses the wall
      surface of the vessel, a considerable period of time is required
      in order to take out the plant from the vessel, and such an
      operation damages the root.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0142] Further, the plant-growing vessel or
      sheet according to the present invention having the
      above-mentioned structure can solve the above-mentioned problems
      on the basis of the function peculiar to such a vessel or sheet,
      as described hereinbelow.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0143] A polymer capable of providing a
      hydrogel having a crosslinked structure is disposed on the inner
      wall of the vessel or sheet according to the present invention by
      coating, etc. When the support (such as soil) in the neighborhood
      of the inner wall of the vessel assumes a water-excessive state
      for the above-mentioned reason, the polymer absorbs water and
      becomes a hydrogel state. On the other hand, when the support in
      the neighborhood of the inner wall of the vessel assumes a
      water-deficient state, the hydrogel particles have a function of
      transferring water therefrom into the support. As a result, the
      environment for water in the rhizosphere in the neighborhood of
      the inner wall of the vessel is maintained almost constant, and
      the problems encountered in the prior art are solved.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0144] Particularly, in an embodiment of the
      present invention wherein the above hydrogel-forming polymer
      comprises a hydrogel-forming polymer wherein the water absorption
      magnification is decreased along with an increase in temperature
      in the temperature range of not lower than 0 DEG C and not higher
      than 70 DEG C, and the change in the water absorption
      magnification is reversible with respect to temperature, the
      polymer absorbs water from the support when the temperature
      becomes lower, while the polymer discharges water into the support
      when the temperature becomes higher. In other words, the water
      content in the support in the neighborhood of the sheet or the
      wall of the vessel is increased as the temperature becomes higher.
      In general, it is considered that a plant demands a smaller amount
      of water when the temperature is low (below about 5-20 DEG C), and
      demands a larger amount of water as the temperature becomes higher
      (about 20 - 35 DEG C). It is also considered that the excessive
      water content at a low temperature invites a root decay
      phenomenon, and the deficient water content at a high temperature
      invites growth inhibition. Accordingly, when the above-mentioned
      vessel or sheet having a hydrogel-forming polymer disposed therein
      is used, the environment in the rhizosphere is maintained more
      suitably, thereby to promote the growth of the plant more
      effectively.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0145] In addition, the hydrogel-forming
      polymer disposed on the inner wall of the plant-growing vessel (or
      on the sheet to be disposed on the inner wall of the vessel) has a
      function of storing water content and/or nutrients in the
      crosslinked structure of the polymer as described above.
      Therefore, the storing function which has been performed by the
      "space" in the conventional growing vessel, may be performed by
      the above polymer extremely effectively in place of the above
      space. Therefore, according to the present invention (even when
      the ability of the growing vessel for storing water content and
      nutrients is retained constant), the internal volume of the vessel
      can be reduced remarkably.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0146] As described above, according to the
      present invention, the volume of a vessel which has been
      considered to be "appropriate" in the prior art can be reduced
      remarkably, and further the originating power of the root can be
      improved due to an increase in the opportunity for the mechanical
      contact stimulus. Further, on the basis of the reduction in the
      internal volume of the vessel per se, it is also possible to
      reduce the area to be used for growing a plant, to reduce the
      amount of the material for the growing vessel, and to reduce the
      transporting costs, etc. In addition, in combination with the
      above-mentioned labor saving in the water control, remarkable cost
      reduction can be accomplished.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0147] Further, since the conventional vessel
      for home use has a lower portion of an open-system, and an excess
      of water is discharged from the open-system lower portion at the
      time of the watering, etc., a "receiving pan" must be used
      simultaneously with the vessel. The use of such a pan is
      troublesome and it is liable to impair the beautiful appearance of
      the system.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0148] On the contrary, in the plant-growing
      vessel according to the present invention, since the water-storing
      ability is imparted to the wall surface of the vessel, it is not
      necessarily required to provide an opening portion at a lower part
      of the vessel. In other words, the opening portion of the vessel
      is omissible in the present invention. When the vessel having a
      closed-type lower portion is used, the problems encountered in the
      conventional vessel for home use (having an open-system lower
      portion) are easily solved.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0149] In the above, the growth of a plant
      after the germination thereof has mainly been described, but the
      vessel or sheet according to the present invention is also
      suitably applicable to the germination of a seed or the growth
      thereof after the germination.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0150] The shape or form of the hydrogel or
      hydrogel-forming polymer to be disposed in the inside of the
      vessel according to the present invention is not particularly
      limited, but may appropriately be selected depending on the kind
      of a plant, growth method therefor, etc. Specific examples of the
      shape of the hydrogel or polymer may comprise various shapes such
      as layer-like shape, micro-bead-like shape, fiber-like shape,
      film-like shape, and indeterminate shape.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0151] The dimension or size of the hydrogel or
      polymer in the present invention may appropriately be selected
      depending on the kind of the plant, cultivation method therefor,
      etc. In order to enhance the water-absorbing rate for the
      hydrogel-forming polymer, it is preferred to increase the surface
      area of the hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer per unit volume
      thereof, that is, to decrease the dimension of one object (e.g.,
      one particle) of the hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer. For
      example, the dimension or size of the hydrogel or polymer in the
      present invention may generally be in the range about 0.1 mu m to
      1 cm, more preferably in the range about 1 mu m to 5 mm
      (particularly about 10 mu m to 1 mm), in a dried state thereof.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0152] In the hydrogel or polymer according to
      the present invention, the above-mentioned "dimension in a dried
      state" refers to the average of maximum diameters (maximum
      dimensions) of the hydrogel or polymer (average of values obtained
      by measuring at least 10 objects). More specifically, e.g., the
      following dimension may be treated as the "dimension in a dried
      state" according to the shape of the above hydrogel or
      hydrogel-forming polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Micro-bead shape: particle size (average
      particle size);<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fiber shape: average of lengths of respective
      fiber-like pieces;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Film shape, indeterminate shape: average of
      maximum dimensions of respective pieces; and<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Layer shape: thickness of a polymer layer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0153] In the present invention, in place of
      the above "average of maximum values", it is also possible to use
      the diameter of a "ball" having a volume equal to the average of
      the volumes of respective pieces (average of values obtained by
      measuring at least 10 pieces) as the "dimension in a dried state"
      of the particles of the above hydrogel or hydrogel-forming
      polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        shaping hydrogel or polymer)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0154] The method of shaping of the hydrogel or
      hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present invention is not
      particularly limited. AS such a method, it is possible to use an
      ordinary method of shaping a polymer depending on the desired
      shape of the hydrogel or polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0155] When the simplest method is used, a
      monomer for providing the water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer,
      the above-mentioned multi-functional monomer (such as bifunctional
      monomer), and a polymerization initiator are dissolved in water,
      and the monomer, etc., is polymerized by use of heat or light,
      whereby a hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer may be prepared.
      The resultant hydrogel or hydrogel-forming polymer is mechanically
      crushed or pulverized, the unreacted monomer, the remaining
      polymerization initiator, etc., are removed therefrom by washing
      with water, etc., and thereafter the resultant product is dried,
      thereby to provide a hydrogel-forming polymer for constituting the
      vessel or sheet according to the present invention.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0156] Further, when the monomer for providing
      the water-soluble or hydrophilic polymer is liquid, the
      multi-functional monomer and polymerization initiator are added
      into the monomer, the monomer is polymerized by bulk
      polymerization by use of heat or light, the resultant product is
      mechanically crushed, the unreacted monomer and the remaining
      multi-functional monomer are removed therefrom by extraction with
      water, etc., and the product is dried, whereby a hydrogel or
      hydrogel-forming polymer according to the present invention may be
      provided.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0157] On the other hand, when the hydrogel or
      polymer according to the present invention in a micro-bead shape
      is intended to be prepared, it is possible to use an emulsion
      polymerization method, a suspension polymerization method, a
      precipitation polymerization method, etc. In view of the control
      of the resultant particle size, a reverse-phase suspension
      polymerization method may particularly preferably be used. In the
      reverse-phase suspension polymerization method, as a dispersion
      medium, an organic solvent (e.g., saturated hydrocarbon such as
      hexane) which does not dissolve the monomer and the resultant
      polymer is preferred. In addition, it is also possible to use a
      surfactant (e.g., a nonionic surfactant such as sorbitan fatty
      acid ester) as a suspension auxiliary in combination with the
      above organic solvent.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0158] The particle size of the resultant
      micro-bead may be controlled by the kind or amount of the
      surfactant to be added, the stirring speed, etc. As the
      polymerization initiator, either of a water-soluble polymerization
      initiator, and a water-insoluble polymerization initiator may be
      used.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0159] When the hydrogel or polymer according
      to the present invention is formed into a fiber shape, film shape,
      etc., e.g., it is possible to use a method wherein an aqueous
      solution of a water-soluble polymer is extruded into an organic
      solvent which is unmixable with water by using a die, etc., to
      form each of the predetermined shapes, and then the resultant
      product is irradiated with light, electron beam, gamma -ray, etc.,
      so as to impart a crosslinked structure to the polymer. Further,
      it is also possible to use a method wherein the above
      water-soluble polymer is dissolved in an organic solvent or water,
      is shaped by a solvent casting method, and then is irradiated with
      light, electron beam, gamma -ray, etc., so as to impart a
      crosslinked structure to the polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0160] In general, the crop cultivation under
      high-temperature and over-humidity condition is liable to cause a
      phenomenon such as stem spindly growth, or branching or blooming
      defectiveness, so as to lower the value of the agricultural
      products. Further, the problem of such a value decrease can also
      occur in some cases, depending on the character of the race of the
      plant. In such a case, it is preferred to use a dwarfing agent
      having an effect of suppressing the extension of the stem, etc.,
      so as to promote the branching and blooming, as desired. In the
      present invention, in an embodiment using the hydrogel-forming
      polymer having a crosslinked structure may preferably be a polymer
      which shows a decrease in water absorption magnification along
      with an increase in a temperature range of not lower than 0 DEG C
      and not higher than 70 DEG C, and exhibits a water absorption
      magnification which is reversibly changeable with respect to
      temperature, when the dwarfing agent is incorporated into the
      inside of the hydrogel or polymer, the plant-cultivating support,
      soil-modifying agent, vessel, or sheet comprising the resultant
      hydrogel or polymer as a constitution element thereof discharges
      therefrom the dwarfing agent to the outside (e.g., into soil) at a
      high temperature so as to suppress the stem elongation of the
      plant. On the other hand, at a lower temperature at which the
      demand for the dwarfing agent becomes low, the dwarfing agent is
      not discharged from the hydrogel or polymer, and therefore
      persistence of the effect of the dwarfing agent is improved
      remarkably.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0161] In general, the necessity for a weed
      killer also becomes greater at a high temperature as compared with
      that at a low temperature. Accordingly, when the weed killer is
      incorporated into the hydrogel or polymer according to the present
      invention, the effect of the weed killer and the persistence
      thereof are remarkably improved on the basis of the same
      storage-discharge mechanism as described above.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Shape and
        material of vessel/sheet)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0162] The shape of the plant-growing vessel
      according to the present invention is not particularly limited as
      long as the above-mentioned "hydrogel-forming polymer having a
      crosslinked structure" is disposed inside thereof, but may be
      formed into one of known various shapes such as cotyle-type,
      pot-type, planter-type, tray-type, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0163] The schematic sectional view of Fig. 1
      shows an embodiment (pot-type) of the growing vessel according to
      the present invention. Referring to Fig. 1, a layer 2 comprising a
      "hydrogel-forming polymer having a crosslinked structure" is
      disposed in the inside of a pot-type vessel 1 having a bottom 1a
      and a side wall portion 1b. Of course, it is possible that one or
      more holes (not shown) may be provided in the bottom 1a or side
      wall portion 1b as desired.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0164] Similarly, the shape of the plant sheet
      according to the present invention is not particularly limited as
      long as the above-mentioned "hydrogel-forming polymer having a
      crosslinked structure" is disposed on the surface of at least a
      portion thereof, but may be formed into one of various kinds of
      known shapes.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0165] The schematic sectional view of Fig. 2
      shows an embodiment of the growing sheet according to the present
      invention. Referring to Fig. 2, a layer 2a comprising a
      "hydrogel-forming polymer having a crosslinked structure" is
      disposed on one of the surfaces of a sheet base material 11a. On
      the surface (back) of the sheet base material 11a disposed
      opposite to the face on which the polymer layer 2a is disposed, a
      layer 3 comprising a sticking agent or adhesive (comprising
      carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), etc.) may be disposed as desired.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0166] Further, as shown in Fig. 3, a sheet 4
      having a releasing property may be disposed on the sticking
      agent/adhesive layer 3 as desired. When the sheet 11 of such an
      embodiment as shown in Fig. 3 is used, the sheet 11 may easily be
      placed at a desired location of a conventional vessel (not shown)
      by tearing off the releasing sheet 4, and thereafter disposing the
      sheet 11 in the conventional vessel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0167] The sheet according to the present
      invention may be formed into a shape having a partition (internal
      dividing wall) as desired.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0168] The schematic perspective views of Fig.
      4A to Fig. 4B show an example of the embodiment of the sheet
      according to the present invention having a partition. Fig. 4A
      shows an example of the single cell-type partition form (with an
      extension portion), and Fig. 4B shows an example of the 4 (four)
      cell-type partition form. The number of the "cell" to be formed by
      these partitions is not particularly limited, but may preferably
      be about 1 - 10000 (more preferably about 10 - 1000) in view of
      efficient utilization or efficiency of the cultivating area. In
      these partition-type sheet 12 according to the present invention,
      the layer (not shown) comprising the "hydrogel-forming polymer
      having a crosslinked structure" is disposed on at least a portion
      of the surface 5 of the partition on which a plant is to be
      disposed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0169] As shown in the schematic plan view of
      Fig. 5, when the partition-type sheet 12 according to the present
      invention is used in combination with "another vessel" 6
      (conventional vessel is also usable), the removal of a plant at
      the time of the transfer thereof becomes very easy by utilizing
      the attachment and detachment between the sheet 12 and the other
      vessel 6. In other words, when the grown plant (not shown) is
      intended to be removed from the vessel 6 or sheet 12, the removal
      of the plant becomes extremely easy by pulling out the partition
      12 from the vessel 6 in advance. The above-mentioned other vessel
      6 may also be a conventional vessel, or a plant-growing vessel
      (i.e., vessel according to the present invention) wherein a layer
      2 of the "hydrogel-forming polymer" is disposed in the inside
      thereof as desired.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0170] The material for the vessel or sheet
      according to the present invention is not particularly limited,
      but may appropriately be one of known materials such as ceramic or
      earthenware (unglazed pottery), metal, wood, plastic, and paper.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Embodiment of
        polymer arrangement)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0171] In the present invention, the location,
      area, shape (e.g., either of an intermittent layer or continuous
      layer), or means of disposing the hydrogel-forming polymer is not
      particularly limited as long as the polymer is disposed in the
      inside of the growing vessel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0172] The location of the above-mentioned
      polymer disposed in the vessel may for example be either of the
      bottom face 1a or the side face 1b (Fig. 1) of the vessel, but the
      polymer may preferably be disposed on the side face 1b of the
      vessel in view of easiness in retaining the plant by the swelling
      of the polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0173] In the present invention, in order to
      effectively exhibit the function of the hydrogel-forming polymer,
      when the area of internal surface of the vessel (or the area of
      one of the side surfaces of a sheet) is denoted by Sa, and the
      area on which the hydrogel-forming polymer has been disposed is
      denoted by Sp, the ratio (Sp/Sa) x 100 of these areas may
      preferably be about 10 % or more, more preferably about 50 % or
      more (particularly about 70 % or more).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0174] In the present invention, the layer 2 or
      2a of the hydrogel-forming polymer may be a continuous layer or an
      intermittent layer. Such an intermittent layer may easily be
      formed by an arbitrary measure such as screen printing. When the
      intermittent layer is intended to be formed, the plan shape
      thereof may be an arbitrary shape such as checkered pattern-type
      as shown in Fig. 6 A, and spot-type as shown in Fig. 6B.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0175] When the layer 2 or 2a of the
      hydrogel-forming polymer is disposed on the base material 1 of the
      vessel or sheet, the embodiment of the arrangement is not
      particularly limited. In view of easiness in the arrangement
      thereof, there may preferably be used any of an embodiment wherein
      the polymer layer 2 is disposed directly on the base material 1
      (Fig. 7A), an embodiment wherein the polymer layer 2 is disposed
      on a layer 7 of a sticking agent or adhesive which is disposed on
      the base material 1 (Fig. 7B), or an embodiment wherein the
      polymer layer 2 in the shape of an arbitrary form such as
      particulate-type and indeterminate-type is disposed on a layer 7
      of a sticking agent or adhesive which is disposed on the base
      material 1 (Fig. 7C). In the above-mentioned embodiment of Fig.
      7A, in order to impart an adhesive property to the polymer layer 2
      with respect to the base material 1 or to enhance the adhesive
      property, it is possible that a hydrogel-forming polymer is mixed
      or dispersed in the sticking agent or adhesive, and then is formed
      into the above-mentioned polymer layer 2 as desired. In such a
      case, it is preferred to use the sticking agent or adhesive in an
      amount about 0.01 - 10 wt. parts (more preferably, about 0.1 - 2
      wt. parts) with respect to 10 wt. parts of the hydrogel-forming
      polymer.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0176] As the above "sticking agent or
      adhesive", a known sticking agent or adhesive may be used without
      particular limitation, but it is preferred to use a substance
      which is substantially non-toxic or has a low toxicity to a plant
      to be cultivated, as the above-mentioned substance. Specific
      examples of such a sticking agent or adhesive may include: rubber
      or latex-type (natural rubber-type, isoprene latex-type), acrylic
      resin-type (acrylic-type, cyano-acrylate-type), epoxy resin-type,
      urethane resin-type, protein-type (soybean protein-type,
      gluten-type), starch-type (starch-type, dextrin-type), and
      cellulose-type (CMC-type, nitro-cellulose-type).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0177] In any of the above-mentioned
      embodiments of the vessel or sheet, in order to effectively
      exhibit the function of the hydrogel-forming polymer, when the
      area of internal surface of the vessel (or the area of one of the
      side surfaces of a sheet) is denoted by Sa, and the weight of the
      disposed hydrogel-forming polymer is denoted by Mp, the amount of
      the application of the polymer (Mp/Sa) may preferably be about
      0.0001 g/cm&lt;2&gt; (0.1 mg/cm&lt;2&gt;) or more, more preferably
      about 0.001 g/cm&lt;2&gt; (1 mg/cm&lt;2&gt;) to 0.2 g /cm&lt;2&gt;
      (particularly about 0.002 g/cm&lt;2&gt; (2 mg/cm&lt;2&gt;) to 0.1

        producing plant-growing vessel or sheet)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0178] The process for producing a shaped
      product (vessel or sheet), the base material surface of which the
      hydrogel has been fixed is not particularly limited, but, e.g.,
      either of the following two processes may preferably be used.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0179] The first process is one wherein the
      material to be used as the base material is shaped into a vessel
      or sheet such as pot and planter in advance, then a substance
      (such as sticking agent and adhesive) having a function of fixing
      the hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel is applied onto a face
      for forming the internal surface of the shaped product, and the
      hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel is fixed onto the thus
      applied substance.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0180] The second process is one wherein a
      substance (such as sticking agent and adhesive) having a function
      of fixing the hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel is applied onto
      a surface of a sheet or film to be formed into the base material,
      the hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel is fixed onto the thus
      applied substance, and then the resultant product is shaped into a
      form such as pot or planter by a pressure molding process, etc.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0181] When the above-mentioned first process
      is used, the material to be formed into a base material may be
      shaped into a form such as pot or planter by various kinds of
      molding processes such as injection molding, pressure molding, and
      blow molding. As the above substance for fixing the
      hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel to the internal surface of
      the shaped product, a known substance such as sticking agent or
      adhesive which is ordinarily commercially available may be used
      without particular limitation, but it is preferred to use a
      substance which is substantially non-toxic or has a low toxicity
      to a plant, as the above-mentioned substance. Specific examples of
      such a sticking agent or adhesive may include: sticking agents and
      adhesives of rubber-type, latex-type, acrylic resin-type, epoxy
      resin-type, urethane resin-type, protein-type, starch-type, and
      cellulose-type.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0182] It is possible that the above adhesive
      or sticking agent is applied onto the internal surface of the
      above-mentioned shaped product by spraying, casting, or dipping,
      etc., and the hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel is fixed onto
      the thus applied adhesive or sticking agent. Further, in place of
      the above-mentioned adhesive, sticking agent, etc., it is also
      possible that a double-side adhesive-coated tape onto which the
      above-mentioned sticking agent, etc., has been applied in advance,
      is attached to the internal surface of the above-mentioned shaped
      product, and the hydrogel-forming polymer or a hydrogel is fixed
      onto the tape.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0183] In the above first process, it is also
      possible that the material to be formed into the base material is
      shaped into a form such as pot and planter by injection molding,
      etc., a material obtained by dispersing a hydrogel-forming polymer
      or hydrogel in a thermoplastic elastomer, etc., is applied to the
      internal surface of the resultant shaped product by injection
      molding using a two-color molding process, whereby the
      hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel may be fixed onto the
      internal surface of the shaped product of the base material.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0184] On the another hand, in the second
      process, it is possible that a substance (such as above-mentioned
      adhesive and sticking agent) capable of fixing the
      hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel is applied onto the surface
      of sheet or film to be formed into the base material by spraying,
      casting, etc., or the above-mentioned double-side adhesive-coated
      tape is attached thereonto, and then the hydrogel-forming polymer
      or hydrogel is fixed onto the thus applied or attached substance,
      and the resultant base material is shaped by pressure molding,
      etc. Further, a material obtained by dispersing the
      hydrogel-forming polymer or hydrogel in a thermoplastic elastomer,
      etc., is shaped into a multi-layer sheet or multi-layer film by a
      multi-layer extrusion process together with a material to be
      formed into the base material so that the hydrogel-forming polymer
      or hydrogel is fixed onto the base material sheet or base material
      film, and then the resultant base material is shaped by pressure
      molding, etc.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0185] As the method of effectively
      transferring (or plant-embedding) a plant by using the vessel or
      sheet having the hydrogel-forming polymer disposed therein
      according to the present invention, e.g., the following methods of
      using the vessel or sheet may preferably be used.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) There is used a vessel or a sheet shaped
      into a vessel-type form which contains hydrogel-forming polymer
      particles disposed therein in an amount such that the inside of
      the vessel is filled with the resultant hydrogel when the polymer
      particles absorb water. Then, at least a portion of a plant is
      placed in the vessel or sheet, and thereafter a (fertilizer)
      solution, etc., is added into the vessel so as to swell the
      hydrogel-forming polymer particles, thereby to fix the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) There is used a vessel or a sheet shaped
      into a vessel-type form which contains hydrogel-forming polymer
      particles disposed therein in an amount such that the inside of
      the vessel is filled with the resultant hydrogel when the polymer
      particles absorb water. Then, a solution, etc., is added into the
      vessel or sheet so as to fill the vessel or sheet with the
      resultant hydrogel, and thereafter at least a portion of a plant
      is inserted into the gel, thereby to fix the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the above-mentioned method (1) or (2) is
      used, since the swollen hydrogel particles containing water have
      an appropriate fluidity, the plant may smoothly be transferred
      without damaging the plant. Further, in the case of a minute
      tissue such as seed, adventive embryo to be provided by tissue
      culture , and PLB (Protocorm Like Body; a tissue provided by
      tissue culture, which is similar to spherical tissue formed by the
      germination of a seed), it is also possible to use a method of
      simply placing the tissue, etc., on the hydrogel.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) There is used a vessel or a sheet shaped
      into a vessel-type form which contains hydrogel-forming polymer
      particles disposed therein in an amount such that the inside of
      the vessel is not sufficiently filled with the resultant hydrogel
      when the polymer particles absorb water. At least a portion of a
      plant is placed in the vessel together with a plant supporting
      support, and then a solution, etc., is added into the vessel so as
      to swell the hydrogel-forming polymer, thereby to fix the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) A plant is wrapped in a sheet (sheet
      according to the present invention) which has been coated with
      particles of the hydrogel-forming polymer, and is planted or
      embedded into an usual vessel or support, and then a solution,
      etc., is added into the vessel so as to swell the hydrogel-forming
      polymer, thereby to fix the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0186] When any of the above-mentioned (1) to
      (4) is used, the plant may easily be attached or fixed to the
      support immediately.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0187] On the another hand, as the method of
      effectively transferring a plant (or taking out a plant) by using
      the vessel or sheet having the hydrogel-forming polymer disposed
      therein according to the present invention, e.g., the following
      methods of using the vessel or sheet may preferably be used.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) A method wherein a large excess of water is
      supplied to the vessel or sheet so as to enhance the fluidity of
      the hydrogel, thereby to take out the plant without damaging the
      plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) A method of using a vessel or sheet having
      the hydrogel-forming polymer comprising a polymer having a
      carboxyl group, wherein the hydrogel in a swollen state is shrunk
      by adding thereto a high concentration of calcium solution or
      calcium salt powder, thereby to take out the plant without
      damaging the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) A method of using a vessel or sheet having
      the hydrogel-forming polymer having a property such that the water
      absorption magnification is decreased along with an increase in
      temperature in the temperature range of not lower than 0 DEG C and
      not higher than 70 DEG C, and the change in the water absorption
      magnification is reversible with respect to temperature, wherein
      the vessel or sheet is warmed up to a temperature which does not
      adversely affect a plant so that the swollen hydrogel particles
      are caused to discharge the water content contained therein to be
      shrunk, whereby the plant is taken out without damaging the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(4) A method of using a vessel or sheet having
      the hydrogel-forming polymer having a property such that the water
      absorption magnification is decreased along with an increase in
      temperature in the temperature range of not lower than 0 DEG C and
      not higher than 70 DEG C, and the change in the water absorption
      magnification is reversible with respect to temperature, wherein
      the vessel or sheet is supplied with warm water which does not
      adversely affect a plant, so that the swollen hydrogel particles
      are caused to discharge the water content contained therein to be
      shrunk, and the fluidity of the gel particles is enhanced, whereby
      the plant is taken out without damaging the plant. The temperature
      of the above warm water may preferably be about 45 DEG C or less
      (more preferably about 40 DEG C or less), while the temperature
      may somewhat vary depending on the kind of the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;*[0188] When any of the above-mentioned method
      (1) to (4) is used, the plant may easily be taken out from the
      vessel immediately without damaging the plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Method of
        removing liquid substance such as water)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0189] In view of an improvement in
      workability, reduction in transporting costs, etc., at the time of
      the transportation (such as shipment), it is important to reduce
      the weight of the cultivating vessel. Further, at the time of the
      transportation, the plant is put under a closed-type environment
      (e.g., a state wherein the plant is packed with cellophane
      together with a vessel, and put in a corrugated board) in many
      cases. Under such a condition, in order to prevent the damage to
      the plant even in a wetted state, it is important to reduce the
      amount of water contained in the cultivating vessel to as small
      amount as possible.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0190] In a case of using the vessel or sheet
      according to the present invention which has the hydrogel-forming
      polymer disposed therein, when the water content or liquid such as
      fertilizer solution in the vessel or sheet becomes unnecessary,
      for example, the liquid may preferably be removed by the following
      method.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(1) A method wherein the hydrogel particles are
      dried so that the hydrogel particles are caused to discharge water
      contained therein, and the weight thereof is reduced. However, it
      is necessary to conduct such a method in a certain range such that
      the resultant "concentration of nutrient" does not substantially
      affect the plant adversely.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2) A method of using a vessel or sheet having
      the hydrogel-forming polymer comprising a polymer having a
      carboxyl group, wherein the hydrogel in a swollen state is shrunk
      by adding thereto a high concentration of calcium solution or
      calcium salt powder, thereby to cause the hydrogel to discharge a
      liquid such as water content and fertilizer solution.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(3) A method of using a vessel or sheet having
      the hydrogel-forming polymer having a property such that the water
      absorption magnification is decreased along with an increase in
      temperature in the temperature range of not lower than 0 DEG C and
      not higher than 70 DEG C, and the change in the water absorption
      magnification is reversible with respect to temperature, wherein
      the vessel or sheet is warmed up to a temperature which does not
      adversely affect a plant so that the swollen hydrogel particles
      are caused to discharge a liquid such as water content and
      fertilizer solution which has been contained in the hydrogel
      particles.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0191] In the prior art, the water which has
      been supplied to a plant before the shipment thereof may cause a
      problem such that it weaken the resistance to dryness so as to
      decrease the persistence of the flower, and it decrease the sugar
      content in the resultant fruit. Also in order to solve such a
      problem, it is preferred to remove water content, etc., by using
      the above-mentioned (1) to (3) (preferably, by the method (2) or
      (3)) in advance, before the shipment.<br>

      g (0.32 mmol) of N,N'-methylenebis acrylamide were dissolved in 26
      ml of distilled water. Into thus obtained solution, 0.52 g (7
      mmol) of calcium hydroxide and 14 ml (14 mmol) of 1N-aqueous
      potassium hydroxide solution were added. While the resultant
      mixture was stirred at room temperature under a stream of
      nitrogen, 0.02 g of ammonium persulfate and 0.01 g of ascorbic
      acid were added thereto. After 5 minutes counted from the addition
      of the ammonium persulfate and ascorbic acid, the temperature of
      the reaction mixture was abruptly increased so that the mixture
      was converted into a gel. Further, the reaction was continued as
      it was for 1 hour under the stream of nitrogen.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0194] 200 ml of ethyl alcohol was added to the
      resultant product, and was pulverized in a mixer. The resultant
      gel was separated from the pulverized product and was subjected to
      vacuum drying.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0195] A predetermined amount (0.2 g) of thus
      obtained hydrogel-forming polymer (water-retaining support
      according to the present invention) was weighed in a platinum
      crucible, was subjected to ashing in an electric furnace (at 700
      DEG C), and was then dissolved in 5 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid.
      Distilled water was added to the resultant product to provide a
      total volume of 50 ml. When the potassium ion content therein was
      determined by means of an atomic absorption spectrophotometer
      (mfd. by Seiko Electronics K.K.; trade name: SAS-760), it was
      found to be 1.3 mmol/g.<br>

      Acryhope; mfd. by Nippon Shokubai K.K.) was swollen with 1 L of
      ion-exchange water. To the thus swollen highly water-absorbing
      resin, an aqueous solution which had been obtained by dissolving
      2.9 g of calcium chloride (dihydrate salt) in 500 ml of
      ion-exchange water was added. As the resultant mixture was left
      standing for 1 hour at room temperature (25 DEG C) while being
      occasionally stirred, the sodium salt of carboxyl group was
      partially substituted by the calcium salt.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0198] The resultant supernatant above the
      swollen resin was discarded, 2 L of ion-exchange water was added
      to the resultant gel so as to wash the gel, and then the
      supernatant above the swollen resin was discarded again. After the
      operation of washing the gel with ion-exchange water was repeated
      five times, 1 L of ethyl alcohol was added to the gel to shrink
      the gel, and the gel was separated from the resultant mixture and
      was subjected to vacuum drying.<br>

      fixed value, and the sodium ion content therein was determined by
      atomic absorption spectrometry, in the same manner as in Example
      1. As a result, the sodium ion content was found to be 2.2 mmol/g.
      Further, the calcium ion content was 2.1 mmol/g.<br>

      water. To the thus swollen resin, 170 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid
      was added. While the mixture was occasionally stirred at room
      temperature (25 DEG C), the sodium salt of carboxyl group was
      substituted by carboxylic acid for 1 hour.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0202] The resultant supernatant above the

      1 L of ion-exchange water and 20 ml of 1N-hydrochloric acid were
      added to the resultant gel. After the thus obtained mixture was
      left standing for 1 hour at room temperature (25 DEG C) while the

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0207] A predetermined amount of the thus

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0215] A water-retaining support of Comparative
      Example was obtained in the same manner as in Example 3 except
      that the amount of the 1N-aqueous potassium hydroxide solution was
      changed to 8.34 ml. A predetermined amount of the thus obtained
      water-retaining support was weighed in a platinum crucible, and in
      the same manner as in Example 1, was subjected to ashing in an
      electric furnace, dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the total
      volume thereof was adjusted to the fixed value, and the potassium
      ion content therein was determined by atomic absorption
      spectrometry. As a result, the potassium ion content was found to
      be to be 3.6 mmol/g.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0216] The calcium ion absorption of the above
      water-retaining support and its water absorption magnification in
      ion-exchange water (electric conductivity: 2.5 mu S/cm) were 55
      mg/g and 191, respectively.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0217] With respect to three kinds of
      commercially available highly water-absorbing resins (trade name:
      Acryhope, mfd. by Nippon Shokubai K.K.; trade name: Diawet, mfd.
      by Mitsubishi Chemical K.K.; and trade name: Sumicagel, mfd. by
      Sumitomo Chemical K.K.), the calcium ion absorption and the water
      absorption magnification in ion-exchange water (electric
      conductivity: 2.5 mu S/cm) were measured. The thus obtained
      results are shown in the following Table 1 together with the
      results obtained in Examples 1 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 and
      2.<br>

        Germination)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0218] Synthetic water (as shown in Table 2
      appearing herein below) having a composition similar to that of
      underground water in Kumano district of Enzan City in Yamanashi
      Prefecture was prepared. Into a test tube (having a diameter of
      2.5 cm and a height of 15 cm), 16 ml of the above synthetic water
      and 160 mg (1 wt. %) of each of the water-retaining supports of
      the present invention prepared in Examples 1, 2, 3, and 4 was
      introduced. After the resultant mixture was sufficiently stirred,
      the mixture was left standing for 30 minutes at 25 DEG C, thereby
      to prepare a gel-like culture medium comprising the
      water-retaining support which had absorbed the synthetic water.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0219] Seeds of white radish sprouts (Takii
      Shubyo K.K.) were uniformly put on each of the surfaces of the
      thus obtained gel culture medium in the test tubes in an mount of
      5 seeds/test tube, and the test tube was capped with a silicone
      plug having a 6-mm diameter hole filled with cotton.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0220] The thus capped test tube was cultured
      for 4 days in a culture chamber ( 25 DEG C , illumination
      intensity of 2000 lux, 16h-daytime (fluorescent light
      illumination)), and the ratio of germination (number of germinated
      seeds/5 (seeds) x 100(%)) was investigated.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0221] In the above-mentioned germination and
      germination activity test, the case wherein the seed coat was torn
      and the cotyledon was unfolded was defined as the occurrence of
      germination, and the other cases are defined as no occurrence of
      germination. The length of the shoot portion was measured as the
      average stem length from the base portion to the leaf tip of the
      germinated seed, while the length of the root portion was measured
      as the average root length from the base portion to the tip of the
      main root of the germinated seed. Further, the appearance of the
      root tip, etc., was observed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0222] The thus obtained results are
      inclusively shown in Table 3. In the water-retaining support
      according to the present invention prepared in Examples 1, 2, 3,
      and 4, germination was 100 % in all the groups, and the growth of
      white radish was very good in both shoots and roots.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp; &nbsp;Comparative
        Example 4</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

        Example for Example 6)</span><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0223] The germination tests were conducted in
      the same manner as in Example 6 with respect to the two kinds of
      water-retaining supports prepared in Comparative Examples 1 and 2,
      and three kinds of commercially available highly water-absorbing
      resins (Acryhope, Diawet, and Sumicagel) used in Comparative
      Example 3.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0224] In the case wherein the water-retaining
      support of Comparative Example 1 was used, the water absorption
      magnification was so insufficient that the culture medium was in
      the form of a liquid, whereby the seeds were sunk in the culture
      medium and showed no germination thereof. In the cases where the
      water-retaining supports of Comparative Example 2 and the
      commercially available highly water-absorbing resins were used,
      the seeds showed 100 % germination, but the tip of the root caused
      browning and fatal withering after the root origination thereof,
      and the growth of the shoot portion was completely suppressed (as
      shown in the following Table 3).<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0225] Into a mixer, 100 g of a
      hydrogel-forming polymer (in a powder form) obtained in the same
      manner as in Example 1 were introduced. While the polymer was
      being stirred, 4 g of an aqueous crosslinking agent solution which
      had been obtained by dissolving 10 wt. % of ethylene glycol
      diglycidyl ether in 15 wt. % of aqueous sodium propinate solution
      was added to the polymer and was sufficiently mixed therewith. The
      resultant mixture was heat-treated at 150 DEG C for about 20
      minutes, thereby to obtain a surface-crosslinked water-retaining
      support for plant according to the present invention.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0226] The potassium ion content of the thus
      obtained water-retaining support was measured in the same manner
      as in Example 1, and the potassium ion content was found to be 1.2
      mmol/g.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0227] The calcium ion absorption of the above
      water-retaining support and its water absorption magnification in
      ion-exchange water (electric conductivity: 2.5 mu S/cm) was 16
      mg/g and 314 (times), respectively.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0228] 3 g of the above water-retaining support
      was introduced into a plant box (mfd. by Shibata Hario K.K.,
      comprising polycarbonate, upper portion = 75 x 75 mm, lower
      portion = 65 x 65 mm, height = 100 mm). When the support was
      caused to absorb 150 ml of a Hyponex solution (Hyponex 7-6-9 (mfd.
      by Hyponex Japan K.K.); 1 g/L), the solution was rapidly absorbed
      thereinto, and the support was entirely solidified in a state
      wherein appropriate voids were retained among the swollen
      water-retaining support particles. To the above gel culture
      medium, orchid (cymbidium) plantlets of MFMM (Cym. MELODY FAIR
      'Marilyn Monroe') were transplanted. After the plantlets were
      cultivated for 60 days in a greenhouse, it was observed that all
      of the flower, stem, and root portions of the orchids were well
      grown.<br>

      mixing, the pH value of the resultant mixture was measured by use
      of a pH meter (mfd. by Yokogawa Electric K.K.; trade name: PH-81).
      It was confirmed that the water-retaining supports of the present
      invention obtained in Examples 1 to 5 were weakly acidic (pH 4.7
      to 6.0) which were suitable for plant growth.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0230] In a test tube (having a diameter of 2.5
      cm and a height of 15 cm), 16 ml of a culture liquid (containing
      20 g/L of sucrose and 100 g/L of banana) including a commercially
      available powder type horticultural fertilizer (trade name:
      Hyponex 7-6-19, mfd. by Hyponex Japan K.K., 3.5 g/L) was mixed
      with and dispersed into 400 mg of the dried water-retaining
      support prepared in Example 3. After the mixture was sterilized by
      an autoclave (121 DEG C, 1.2 kg/cm&lt;2&gt;, 20 minutes), the
      mixture was left standing at room temperature, thereby to prepare
      a hydrogel culture medium.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0231] Into the above-mentioned culture medium
      in each of test tubes, two orchid plantlets of YT57 (Cym. LOVELY
      ANGEL 'The Two Virgins') which had been grown so as to have a
      length of about 1.5 cm were transplanted; and the plantlets were
      aseptically cultured for 50 days in a culture chamber (25 DEG C,
      3000 Lux, 16h-daytime). The maximum leaf length of each plantlet
      was measured, it was found to be 6.7 cm on average. The roots of
      plantlets were well elongated. The plantlets were also grown well
      after they were moved into cultivation under greenhouse condition,
      and exhibited substantially no dying of the leaf tip.<br>

      in the same manner as in the above-mentioned Example 9 except that
      100 mg of agar was added instead of the dried water-retaining

      which was substantially the same as that in the above-mentioned
      Example. Their roots were well grown in the appearance thereof,
      but somewhat dying of the leaf tip was observed after they were
      moved into cultivation under greenhouse condition. It was presumed
      that the above phenomenon was attributable to the fact that the

      in any of the shoot and root portions thereof.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0234] In a plant box (mfd. by Shibata Hario
      K.K., comprising polycarbonate, upper portion = 75 x 75 mm, lower
      portion = 65 x 65 mm, height = 100 mm), 1.5 g of the dried
      water-retaining support obtained in Example 5 and 105 ml of a
      Hyponex solution (Hyponex 7-6-9; 2.0 g/L) was mixed and dispersed
      together. After the mixture was sterilized by an autoclave (121
      DEG C, 1.2 kg/cm&lt;2&gt;, 20 minutes), the mixture was
      aseptically mixed with 80 ml of pearlite (mfd. by Nihon Cement
      K.K.; trade name: Asano-Pearlite No. 3) which had been separately
      sterilized, thereby to prepare a hydrogel culture medium.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0235] To the above culture medium, orchid
      plantlets of MFMM (Cym. MELODY FAIR 'Marilyn Monroe') which had
      been grown so as to have a length of about 4 cm were transplanted
      in an amount of 16 plants in each box; and the plantlets were
      aseptically cultured for 50 days in a culture chamber (25 DEG C,
      3000 Lux, 16h-daytime). The plantlets were well grown, the state
      of their root was very good, and white thick roots, which were
      similar to those obtained in the growth in farm cultivation, were
      elongated.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0236] MFMM plantlets were cultured for 50 days
      in the same manner as in the above-mentioned Example 10 except
      that agar gel (700 mg) was used alone instead of the dried
      water-retaining support used in Example 10. The shoot portions
      were well grown, but the roots were not elongated so much and the
      roots were thin which had a form different from those to be
      elongated in farm cultivation.<br>

      in the same manner as in the above-mentioned Example 10 except

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0238] Into 20g of the dried water-retaining
      support prepared in Example 1, each of amounts of 1000, 800, 600,
      400, and 200 cc of a Hyponex solution (Hyponex 7-6-19, 2 g/L,
      dissolved in synthetic water) was completely absorbed so as to
      form a gel. The pF values of the thus obtained gels were measured
      by a pF meter (manufacture by Daiki Rika Kogyo K.K.; DIK-8340) to
      be 0, 0, 1.8, 2.1, and 2.3, respectively. The water content in a
      culture medium immediately after plantlet transplantation in usual
      culture is decreased by 40 to 80 % until the culture-terminating
      stage due to the evaporation toward the outside of the vessel and
      the absorption thereof by a plant during the culture. In this
      Example, however, it was found that the pF at termination of the
      culture changed to the range of 1.8 to 2.3 when the
      hydrogel-forming polymer was used in this Example. That is, it is
      presumed that, in the plantlet culture using the water-retaining
      support according to the present invention, an appropriate water
      stress is applied to the root of a plant during the culture,
      thereby to well acclimate the plant.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0239] With 1000 cc of the Hyponex solution
      used in Example 10, 7 g of agar was heated and dissolved. After
      the mixture was converted into a gel at room temperature, the pF
      value thereof was measured and it was found to be 0 (zero). After
      the gel was dried in a culture chamber, and the pF value at each
      of the gel weights of 809 g, 609 g, 409 g, and 209 g was measured.
      As a result, all of them were found to be 0. Though 40 to 80 % of
      water in a culture medium is usually decreased during culture, it
      was found that the pF value in the agar gel hardly changed. That
      is, it is presumed that, in the plantlet culture using the agar
      gel, no stress is applied to the root of a plant during the
      culture at all, whereby preferable acclimation would not proceed.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0240] Into an Erlenmeyer flask (mfd. by
      Shibata Hario Glass K.K.; volume: 500 ml), 200 ml of 1/2 Murashige
      &amp; Skoog culture medium (containing 20 g/L of sucrose) was
      introduced. Then, the dried water-retaining support prepared in
      Example 5 was added to the medium at various concentrations (no
      addition, 0.4 g and 1.0 g), and mixed and dispersed therein. After
      the mixture was sterilized by an autoclave (121 DEG C, 1.2
      kg/cm&lt;2&gt;, 20 minutes), the mixture was left standing at room
      temperature, thereby to prepare a suspension culture medium. The
      volume ratio of the suspension culture medium to the gel was about
      9:1 in the 0.4g-addition group, and about 3:1 in the 1.0
      g-addition group.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0241] Into the above-mentioned culture medium,
      PLB (Protocorm Like Body; systematic cell agglomeration peculiar
      to an orchid) was transplanted in an amount of 2.0 g in each
      flask, and aseptically cultured for 22 days in a culture chamber
      (25 DEG C, 3000 Lux, 16h-daytime) while the culture medium was
      shaken and horizontally rotated (80 revolutions per 1 minute with
      a radius of gyration of 27 mm). Thereafter, the resultant fresh
      weight of the PLB was measured, and the state of the PLB and the
      state of elution of a browning material into the culture liquid
      were observed.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0242] As shown in Table 6, it was found that
      the addition of the water-retaining support according to the
      present invention to the suspension culture system accelerated the
      propagation of PLB and suppressed the elution of the browning
      materials.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0243] Into 115 ml of the synthetic water shown
      in Table 2, 100 mg of Hyponex powder (Hyponex 20-20-20, mfd. by
      Hyponex Japan K.K.) was dissolved. The resultant solution was
      completely absorbed in 1 g of each of various kinds of
      hydrogel-forming polymer powder, so as to form a gel. Into each of
      the above gels, 50 cc of pearlite was added and uniformly mixed
      therewith. Each cell of a cell tray (mfd. by Tokan Kosan K.K. ;
      single cell dimension: 2.5 cm (length) x 2.5 cm (width) x 4.5 cm
      (height); cell number 10 x 20 = 200 holes; with a closed lower
      portion and an open upper portion) was filled with the thus
      obtained support. Each of plantlets of one genus of orchid plant
      family, Phalaenopsis (Dtps. Happy Valentine x Show Girl 'Mai'),
      and cymbidium YT57 was insert-transplanted one by one into each
      cell. The insertion could be performed very easily, and the root
      could fit well with the support without being damaged. The plants
      were cultivated for 45 days in a culture chamber (25 DEG C, 3500
      Lux, 16h-daytime), and the leaf length, root length, fresh weight,
      and number of roots of each plant were measured. During the
      cultivation, ion-exchange water was supplied with a syringe until
      the entire volume of the cell was filled therewith.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0244] As a result, the plants were well grown
      when the hydrogel-forming polymers of Examples 1, 2, and 3 were
      used. The roots of plants were decayed during the cultivation when
      Acryhope, Diawet, and Sumicagel were used. It is presumed that the
      plant suffered a calcium deficiency state when any of Acryhope,
      Diawet, and Sumicagel was used.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0245] As a control group, cultivation
      experiments were conducted in the same manner as that described
      above except that each of agar (10 g/L), bark (sold by Mukoyama
      Orchid Ltd.; bark produced in New Zealand; trade name: MO-2), and
      sphagnum was used as a support instead of the support comprising
      the hydrogel-forming polymer and pearlite.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0246] As a result, in the case of the agar,
      insert-transplantation was easy but the root was decayed during
      the cultivation. In the case of the bark and sphagnum, the
      insert-transplantation was impossible, and each of these support
      was disposed around the root of the plant and then was
      transplanted into the above cells, but such an operation somewhat
      damaged the root. Further, in this case, the root was decayed in
      the course of the cultivation. It is presumed that such a
      phenomenon is attributable to the fact that the agar, bark, and
      sphagnum have weak water-absorbing force, and the surrounding of
      the root was filled with water, whereby the root suffers
      deficiency in oxygen.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0247] The thus obtained results are summarized

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0248] Into 95 ml of the synthetic water shown
      in Table 2, 95 mg of Hyponex powder (Hyponex 20-20-20; mfd. by
      Hyponex Japan K.K.) was dissolved. Into the resultant solution, 1
      g of the water-retaining support powder prepared in Example 5 and
      100 cc of pearlite was added and uniformly mixed. With the thus
      obtained support, each cell of the cell tray used in Example 13
      was filled. One plantlet (fresh weight: 1.39 g) of one genus of
      orchid plant family, phalaenopsis (Phal. Musashino 'MH' x Phal.
      White Moon 'M-23'), was insert-transplanted in each cell. The
      insertion could be performed quite easily, and the root could fit
      well with the support without being damaged. After the plantlets
      were cultivated for 70 days in a greenhouse, the leaf length, root
      length, and the total fresh weight of each plant was measured.
      Watering during the cultivation was conducted almost everyday from
      the upper face automatic watering, or 30 minutes of capillary
      watering.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0249] As a control group, a combination of
      bark (MO-2): sphagnum (Elein Polo Co., Ltd.; produced in
      Finland):pearlite = 6:3:1 (volume ratio) was used. Since the
      insert-transplantation using this support was impossible, the
      above support was disposed around the root of the plant and then
      was transplanted into cells, which somewhat damaged the root at
      the transplanting.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0250] As shown in the following Table 8, in
      each watering method, better growth of plant was observed in the

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0251] Into 1 g of the dried polymer powder
      prepared in Example 1, 100 ml of a Hyponex solution (Hyponex
      20-20-20, 1 g/L, dissolved in synthetic water) was completely
      absorbed so as to form a gel. The pF value of the thus obtained
      gel was measured by a pF meter (manufacture by Daiki Rika Kogyo
      K.K., DIK-8340), and the value was found to be 0 (zero). The gel
      was transferred to a 9-cm diameter black plastic pot (available
      from Saegusa Shigeo Shoten; diameter: 7.5 cm), and the total
      weight was measured. With no watering at all, the plastic pot was
      left standing in a greenhouse, and the total weight and pF value
      thereof was measured three times at 24, 48, and 72 hours
      thereafter.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0252] In this measurement, the following
      formulas were used.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Water content at each point = weight at each
      point - 1 g (weight of dried polymer) - weight of black vinyl pot<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0253] Initial value (value at starting) to be
      1 (one),<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0254] Nutrient concentration of the solution
      at each point was determined as:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;nutrient concentration at each point = initial
      water content/water content at each point.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0255] The weight and moisture content of 100
      ml of bark was measured and it was found to be 30.93 g and 35.7 %,
      respectively. 100 ml of undried bark was soaked in the Hyponex
      solution used in Example 15 for 24 hours. The thus moisturized
      bark was scooped up with a net, and the surplus water was removed.
      The weight and pF value of the water-retaining bark was 46.56 g
      and 0, respectively. After the bark was transferred to the black
      plastic pot, the total weight thereof was measured, the bark was
      left standing in a greenhouse, and the total weight and pF value
      thereof was measured three times at 24, 48, and 72 hours after the
      initial measurement. The water content and concentration at each
      point was determined by using the formulas in the same manner as
      those in Example 15.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;initial water content = 30.93 (weight of 100 ml
      of bark) x 0.357 (moisture content) + 46.56 (water-retaining bark
      weight) - 30.93 (weight of 100 ml of bark) = 26.67<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;water content at each point = initial water
      content - (initial total weight of vessel - weight at each point)<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0256] initial concentration of Example 15 to
      be 1,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0257] initial concentration of the solution
      was determined as:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;initial concentration of solution = 26.67
      DIVIDED (30.93 x 0.357 + 26.67) = 0.71<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;nutrient concentration of solution at each
      point = initial water content/water content at each point<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0258] When the nutrient content in Example 15
      was considered to be 1, the nutrient content of Comparative
      Example = 26.6 x 0.71 DIVIDED 100 = 0.19.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0259] As shown in the following Table 9, when
      the water-retaining support according to the present invention is
      used as a cultivating support, since its moisture ratio is high,
      as compared with that in the case of the bark, the nutrient
      content may be made greater in the vessel having the same volume,
      and the fluctuation in the nutrient concentration during the
      culture may be made smaller. Further, since a large amount of
      water may be retained for a long period, the frequency of watering
      may be reduced, and the risk of plant being exposed to water
      stress may be avoided.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0260] As shown in the above Table 9, the
      following results were obtained.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0261] The initial water content retained in
      Comparative Example was 27 % on the basis of that of Example.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0262] The initial nutrient content retained in
      Comparative Example was 19 % on the basis of that of Example.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[0263] The nutrient concentration at the
      elapsed time of 72 hours was 1.8 times the initial concentration
      in Example, and the nutrient concentration at the elapsed time of
      72 hours was 3.8 times the initial concentration in Comparative
      Example.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0264] The residual water content at the elapsed time of 72 hours
      was 56 cc in Example and 5 cc in Comparative Example.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0265] The pF value at the elapsed time of 72 hours was 0 in
      Example and 2.0 in Comparative Example.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Industrial Applicability</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0266] As described hereinabove, according to the present
      invention, there is provided a water-retaining support for plant
      comprising a hydrogel-forming polymer having a calcium ion
      absorption of less than 50 mg per 1g of the dry weight thereof and
      having a water absorption magnification in ion-exchange water (at
      room temperature; 25 DEG C) of 100 or more.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0267] The present invention also provides a water-retaining
      support for plant comprising a hydrogel-forming polymer having a
      carboxyl group bonded to the polymer chain thereof, and having a
      content of alkali metal salt or ammonium salt of the carboxyl
      group of 0.3 to 2.5 mmol per 1g of the dry weight of the support.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0268] When the water-retaining support for plant according to the
      present invention is used, since the water-retaining support
      absorbs therein only a small amount of calcium ion, a plant does
      not suffer from calcium ion deficiency. In addition, since the
      water absorption magnification of such a support is sufficiently
      large, the support can supply sufficient water to a plant.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0269] The present invention further provides a plant-growing
      vessel comprising a vessel-shaped substrate capable of
      accommodating therein at least a portion of a plant; and a
      water-retaining support for plant disposed in the vessel-shaped
      substrate and having a crosslinked structure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0270] The present invention further provides a plant-growing
      sheet comprising a sheet-shaped substrate; and a water-retaining
      support for plant disposed on at least one surface of the
      substrate and having a crosslinked structure.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      [0271] When the plant-growing vessel or sheet according to the
      present invention is used, on the basis of the characteristic
      (capacity to store water or nutrient, or the temperature
      dependency thereof) of the hydrogel-forming polymer which is
      disposed on the plant side of the vessel or sheet, and has a
      crosslinked structure, the volume of plant-growing vessel may be
      reduced markedly, thereby to improve the root origination ratio,
      to reduce the area required for plant growth, to reduce the amount
      of material required for a plant-growing vessel, and to decrease
      the transporting cost. Further, the cost may greatly be reduced by
      the labor-saving in water control, etc.<br>
