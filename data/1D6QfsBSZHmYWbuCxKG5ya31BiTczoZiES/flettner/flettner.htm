      <p>Huge spinning cylinders harness the wind --- Inventor plans to
        take strange vessel across the ocean this year. </p>
      <p>From the wharves at Kiel, Germany, the schooner Buckau recently
        put out to sea, a ship without sails or steam Like a ghost ship
        it moved mysteriously through the water with no apparent means
        of propulsion. </p>
      <p>The astounded spectators on shore knew that the boat was an old
        2000-ton steel vessel and that previously 500 square yards of
        canvas had been needed to propel her. But now she was denuded of
        all sails, masts, and rigging. Instead, two strange cylinders,
        resembling giant smoke-stacks, rose from her deck. But no smoke
        was pouring from them and no engine noise was heard. There was
        no churning of screws. Yet the ship plowed its way through the
        rough waters of the Baltic, ad at nearly twice its former speed.
      </p>
      <p>For several weeks the secret o the strange ship with the great
        towers was closely guarded. People were told only that the craft
        was equipped with a Flettner rotor, a new invention, the work of
        Anton Flettner, director of the Institute of Aerodynamics at
        Amsterdam, Holland. </p>
      <p>When finally the explanation came, the world gasped in
        amazement. For Dr Flettner calmly announced that he had returned
        to the wind as a source of energy. He had harnessed it in a new
        way. He had developed an invention that may permit ocean liners
        to reduce their crews two-thirds and save 90 percent in fuel. He
        and these spinning surfaces, presented to the wind, provided a
        means of propulsion. This statement, after steamboats,
        oil-driven ships, and electrically operated ships had relegated
        sailing vessels into dim obscurity, immediately challenged
        international attention. Several authorities, including
        officials of a great steamship line, pronounced the invention
        the most startling maritime development since Fulton’s
        steamboat. Others were more skeptical, asking how the Buckau
        would perform in a heavy sea, and are yet to be convinced of the
        value of the invention. They also pointed out that the most that
        can be claimed for the new ship is that it will apply to better
        advantage the power available for a ship supplied with sails. It
        cannot replace, in any case, the ship driven by steam or
        internal-combustion engines. In the United States most experts
        have adopted an attitude of watchful waiting with regard to the
        invention. </p>
      <p>The scientific principle upon which Dr Flettner based his
        invention has been known for nearly three-quarters of a century.
        Briefly, this is that a cylinder revolving in the wind will
        exert pressure at right angles to the current. This principle,
        known as the Magnus law, can be understood readily by any one
        who is familiar with baseball. The giant cylinders, or rotors,
        spinning in the wind, increase air pressure on one side and
        suction on the other, just as the surface of a rapidly spinning
        baseball from the hand of a pitcher piles up a difference of
        pressure on its two sides that deflects the ball into a curve.
        In the case of the baseball, of course, the equivalent of wind
        is produced by the swift passage of the ball from pitcher to
        catcher. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Each of the two spinning towers on the Buckau rests on a
        fixed pivot and moves on ball bearings. The towers are built of
        sheet iron about one-half inch thick, are 60 feet high and 9
        feet in diameter. Two electric motors of 10 horsepower each,
        placed inside the pivots, drive the towers. Current for the
        motors is generated by a Diesel engine. The total weight of the
        complete mechanism --- towers, engine and motors --- is about
        15,000 pounds, just one-fifth the weight of the discarded sails
        and rigging on the same ship. </p>
      <p>In propelling a sailing boat, suction, rather than pressure,
        Flettner explains, is the important factor in producing motive
        power. His aim was to produce artificially, by means of the
        revolving towers, a greater suction power than that produced on
        the vessel equipped with sails. </p>
      <p>When wind strikes a sail, it divides equally, and in this
        division there results what is called a circular current. This
        works with the original current of wind on one side of the sail
        and against it on the other side. On the other side where the
        current whirling around the sail is added to the original
        current, suction or pulling force is created, while on the other
        side the clashing of the two currents results in a pressure or
        pushing force. Of the two forces, suction is the greater factor
        in making the boat move forward. </p>
      <p>The revolving cylinders on the sailless boat impel it on
        exactly the same principle as sails do, but more effectively, it
        is claimed, because a greater suction power is produced. As the
        wind hits one of the rotating towers from the side, one side of
        the cylindrical surface naturally is going against it. There is
        very little friction on the side where the surface goes with the
        wind, and much friction on the other side. </p>
      <p>The wind chooses the easier pathway, avoiding the side
        producing friction, and most of it goes in the direction in
        which the cylinder was originally traveling. Because the moving
        cylinder offers less resistance than a rigid sail, the wind,
        whirling around a cylinder, produces a much greater circular
        current than is created around a sail. Thus the suction is
        greatly increased, the inventor asserts, and the boat moves more
        swiftly than one with sails. </p>
      <p>Twenty horsepower is produced by the two motors that spin the
        towers at the rate of 120 rpm. They take out of the wind about
        1000 horsepower. The inventor claims that each tower produces
        about 15 times as much propulsive power as that of a similar
        surface of canvas. An auxiliary engine is used for getting the
        ship in and out of the harbor. </p>
      <p>When the two cylinders are turning at the same speed and the
        helm is not put on, the Flettner ship sails normally at right
        angles to the wind. Changing the speed of one cylinder is said
        to alter the ship’s course just as changing the helm would. </p>
      <p>N.W. Akimoff, general manager of the Akimoff Propeller Company,
        Philadelphia, recently has given an explanation of the Magnus
        Law as applied top the Flettner ship. He begins by considering
        what would occur if the two cylinders on the Buckau were
        stationary and the longest dimension of the ship were at right
        angles to the wind. In that case, says Mr Akimoff, the wind
        going around each cylinder would be evenly divided so that there
        would be no action on the ship. </p>
      <p>Then, suppose there were no wind, but that the cylinders were
        spinning at the rate of 120 rpm. </p>
      <p>The layers of air directly in contact with the moving
        cylindrical surface would revolve with practically the same
        velocity as the cylinder. </p>
      <p>But in the case of the Flettner ship, there is a combination of
        the two preceding cases --- the cylinders spinning and at the
        same time wind acting upon the ship. Then on one side of the
        cylinder, the velocity of the wind is opposed by the velocity of
        the air adjoining the cylinder, thus retarding the velocity of
        the wind. This means an increase in pressure. </p>
      <p>On the other side of the cylinder, the opposite is true. The
        velocity of the wind combines with the velocity of the air
        layers next the cylinders, resulting in a decrease in pressure.
        On one side of the cylinder there is an increase of pressure, on
        the opposite side a decrease, so that there results a strong
        force from the stronger to the weaker pressure. This causes the
        ship to move forward. </p>
      <p>The magnitude of this effect, Mr Akimoff says, may be computed
        by multiplying the following quantities: the density of the air,
        the velocity of the wind, the peripheral or surface velocity of
        each cylinder, the circumference of each cylinder, and the
        height of each cylinder. In the case of the Buckau, considering
        the velocity of the wind at 40 feet/second, the forward thrust
        due to the moving cylinder would be 12,000 pounds. Actually,
        this would be reduced, on account of various losses, to the
        extent of 10 percent. </p>
      <p>Tests are said to have demonstrated that nearly double the
        speed made by a sailing vessel equipped with sails can be made
        by one with the rotor equipment. ON its trial voyage the Buckau
        developed an average speed of 4.5 knots (5.2 mph) in unfavorable
        weather and in later tests the ship was able to make 8 knots
        (9.2 mph). </p>
      <p>The inventor estimates that with a vessel somewhat larger than
        the Buckau, it would take only 18 days to sail across the
        Atlantic. He is planning to make the trip late this year after
        further experiments. </p>
      <p>A notable feature of the ship is said to be its ease in
        changing direction. With its towers reversed it is possible for
        it to sail backward. A three-bladed rudder enables it to turn
        around on its own length. Any change in course can be made
        without coming to a stop or slackening the speed. </p>
      <p>Supporting Flettner’s claim to practicality is his own
        reputation. Anton Flettner is not a newcomer in marine
        invention. He is recognized by scientists as an experimenter
        along original lines. An automatic rudder that he invented a few
        years ago is widely known and used. </p>
      <p>Prof. Albert Einstein, originator of the theory of relativity,
        has pronounced the rotor principle of great practical
        importance. The Hamburg American Steamship Company, for example,
        became so convinced of its economic value that it has decided to
        use the rotors in 10 new freighters of 10,000 tons each to be
        employed on its East Asia route. </p>
      <p>On the East Asia route, wind conditions are so favorable to the
        operation of the rotor ships that the company hopes tosave fuel
        amounting to 60 percent of that consumed now. Ships equipped
        with the device sailing from Germany to Brazil will make a
        saving of 50 percent, it is estimated, while those to New York
        will save from 35 to 40 percent. </p>
      <p>One of the largest shipping companies in the world is reported
        to be comtemplating using rotor ships as oil-tankers, and
        steamship lines even are considering them as possibilities for
        passenger-carrying vessels. </p>
      <p>The inventor himself does not assert that his device will be a
        substitute for steam or electric power on the high seas. But he
        declares that while the speed of an ocean liner equipped with
        revolving towers would not be increased, the invention would
        save a large percentage of its coal and oil, resulting in a
        great saving in storage space, as well as in the cost of fuel. </p>
      <p>An extremely important line of inquiry developing in the
        consideration of this device, is whether it will be possible to
        store electrical energy, created by the rapidly revolving
        cylinders, in batteries for future use. If this is possible, the
        world will have a remarkable new means for producing electrical
        current. Wind, the vast, unknown, unmeasured element, could be
        harnessed in this easy way to propel anything from farm
        machinery to an electric power plant. </p>
      <p>Flettner has hinted of this. Wind power, he says, eventually
        may supersede both coal and water power on account of its
        cheapness. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Even in the modern age of steam and electricity and gasoline
        engines, the wind still howls as hard as ever. As a source of
        driving power, the wind remains quite as available and quite as
        cheap as it was in the beginning of time. It still blows
        everywhere without cost, and it is free to anyone who will use
        it. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding many generations of dependence on the wind,
        most of us were ready to lose sight of these facts when, a few
        weeks ago, a 31-years old inventive genius blew in from Germany
        to remind us most forcibly of their truth. His reminder was in
        the form of as strange a ship as ever sailed the sea --- a craft
        with odd spinning funnels that caught the breezes and harnessed
        them. </p>
      <p>As Anton Fletner’s rotor ship, the Baden-Baden, sailed into New
        York harbor, welcoming crowds regarded her at first as some kind
        of mysterious freak of invention. Since then, this strange
        vessel and her young inventor have remained to demonstrate to
        the foremost power-using nation on Earth that the wind, as a
        cheap and efficient source of usable energy, is far from being a
        back number. </p>
      <p>We were beginning to think it was. After mariners for thousands
        of years had set bellying sails to the breezes, we saw the
        sailing ships vanish from te seas. After enturies of whirlin
        windmills, we saw the picturesque towers falling to decay, and
        the wide wings tattered and dejected. Served instead by
        tremendously efficient power drawn from the coal and oil of the
        earth and from the discoveries of electricity --- with out motor
        cars, motor ships and all the rest --- we were ready to place
        wind power among the has-beens of history. </p>
      <p>It remained for the genius of Anton Flettner to reawaken us ---
        to prove that it is not the wind itself, but rather man’s method
        of capturing the wind, that has run out of date. What he has
        done is simply to find a new and better way. </p>
      <p>The rotor ship Baden-Baden, which astonished thousands of us
        during it visits to American ports, is the first application of
        Flettner’s&nbsp; revolutionary ideas. It is only a beginning.
        Its real importance lies not so much in its immediate proof that
        wind power can be used effectively as a fuel-saving auxiliary
        for steamships and motor ships, as in te vast possibilities it
        offers in te future for cheaper power on land as well as on sea.
      </p>
      <p>Flettner’s invention, as described in detail in the February
        1925 issue of Popular Science Monthly, is simply the application
        of the scientific principle, known for nearly three-quarters of
        a century, that a cylinder rotating in the wind exerts a force
        at right angles to the wind. On the side of the cylinder moving
        against the wind, the air piles up and exerts pressure. On the
        opposite side suction is created, exerting a pull. Of the total
        forces on the cylinder, about 7/8 is due to suction, and 1/8 to
        pressure. And this force, Flettner has found, is ten times as
        great as that produced by an equal area of canvas sail. </p>
      <p>‘Blue coal’ is the name applied by the inventor to the
        wind-fuel he has thus harnessed for the use of mankind. “It is
        wonderfully cheap”, he tells us, “and it is available to the
        world in billions of horsepower”. </p>
      <p>Just when, where, and how extensively it will be available not
        even Flettner himself has been able to predict with certainty.
        The idea is still in its babyhood. Its possibilities seem almost
        limitless. We do know, however, that the first Flettner rotor
        windmill is being operated by the city of Berlin and is reported
        to be at least 30 percent more efficient than the best of the
        old-time wind sail-mills; also that a second rotor-mill, capable
        of developing 2000 or more horsepower, is being completed. We
        know too, that the same principle recently has been applied by
        certain American automobile manufacturers in rotor ventilators
        for closed cars; that Flettner is working on other industrial
        applications, and that he even predicts that rotors eventually
        may replace the wings on airplanes. Finally, we know that the
        world is eager for just such a source of cheap power, for the
        irrigation and reclamation of vast desert lands, and for
        industry in regions where water power is unavailable. </p>
      <p>Billions of horsepower absolutely free! Anton Flettner seems to
        have been born with a genius to sense the wasted force of
        howling gales, and to devote his inventive mind to their
        mastery. Sprung from a long line of seafaring men, his first
        dreams of invention began when, as a boy, he sailed before the
        mast in his father’s ships. To him the elements were an endless
        source of wonder. When a hurricane struck his vessel off the
        Gold Coast, he was inspired by the tremendous power lost in the
        gale. Conceiving a plan for a wind turbine, he drew rough
        sketches --- enough to convince him that he would need wider
        technical knowledge before he could carry his dream to
        completion. He left the sea and went to school. For five years
        he devoted himself to physics and higher mathematics, first at
        Frankfurt-am-Main, near his birthplace, then at Berlin. </p>
      <p>His first creation was an invention which not only failed but
        nearly ended in disaster. It was a metal sail, somewhat like an
        airplane wing, designed as a substitute for canvas. He strung it
        on the rigging of a small boat and set out. In a light breeze
        the boat almost capsized, and its frightened creator quickly
        sped back to port. Yet this first attempt, futile though it was,
        at least marked a step toward the invention of the metal rotors
        which eventually were to drive the Baden-Baden. </p>
      <p>Another boyhood invention which also merely missed a tragedy,
        was a method of wireless control of moving objects at a
        distance. Anton, then a youth of 17, could find only one man who
        saw any use for it. That man was the owner of a circus. He
        commissioned Flettner to build a device that could put a
        riderless horse through its paces at a distance. The machinery
        was to be hidden in the saddle. </p>
      <p>On the first trial the horse displayed a strong dislike for the
        mysterious saddle. It bucked so violently that it jounced the
        delicate control mechanism out of order. Left to its own
        devices, the machine began to jerk and whip the reins with such
        wild abandon that the horse jumped a fence and ran away. That
        was the end of wireless control for Flettner for the time being,
        although in later years, during the world war, he was to develop
        a system for radio control of army tanks and airplanes which
        went through paces that amazed high army officers. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, during his search for a new way of capturing the
        wind, Flettner hit upon the idea of a free-swinging rudder, one
        of the most valuable of all his inventions. At the outset this
        startling departure from the common hinged ruder met only with
        ridicule. Technical experts scoffed at the idea that a rudder,
        free to swing on its axis like a weather vane, could possibly
        influence the course of a ship. In fact, experts in the German
        patent office refused the young inventor a patent, accompanying
        their refusal with a lengthy document containing complicated
        mathematical calculations to prove that the rudder could not
        possibly work! </p>
      <p>“All right”, said Flettner. “I’ll prove their calculations are
        wrong. And he did He has lived to see his invention installed on
        more than a hundred ships, arge and small, and on at least 500
        airplanes. Today his rudder is being is being adopted by
        shjipbuilders the world over. The secret f its operation is a
        small panel, or fin, set into the tail of the rudder. This fin,
        rather than the main rudder, is controlled by the navigator. He
        simply swings the fin; the fin steers the rudder; the rudder
        steers the ship. </p>
      <p>When the fin is set at an angle to the rudder, it swings the
        latter to a position where water pressure on rudder and fin are
        balanced, Even if the impact of a bid wave temperoraily upsets
        this equilibrium, the rudder immediately returns to its former
        position of balance. </p>
      <p>The increased safety and economy of such an arrangement are
        obvious. Control of the Flettner rudder requires on about 5
        percent of the power needed to manipulate an equally large
        rudder of the old type. Even a ship of 1000 tons may be steered
        by hand. </p>
      <p>From the difficulties he encountered in convincing experts of
        the practicability of the rudder, Flettner knew that he would
        have even greater trouble to put over the rotor ship idea, which
        he eventually developed out of the failure of his metal sail. He
        was not far wrong. When he tried to explain the rotor to
        technical men he found that either they would not, or could not
        understand it. Only when he built a small working model of his
        rotor ship, spinning the rotors by clockwork, did he convince
        them that it would work. And not until the Baden-Baden sailed
        6200 miles across the Atlantic, using on 12 tons of fuel oil, as
        compared with 45 tons for a motor ship of the same size without
        rotors, did he convince skeptics of its economy. </p>
      <p>This economy, he expects, will be demonstrated even more
        strikingly by the new 3000-ton 3-rotor ship Barbara recently
        launched by the German government. Her first long cruise&nbsp;
        will bring her to the United States some time in October. </p>
      <p>Ion the application of the rotor principle to windmills,
        Flettner sees even a more valuable source of cheap power. The
        first rotor mill in Berlin is designed to turn an electric light
        and power plant. It consists of a wind wheel, some 60 feet in
        diameter, with four spokes, and on each spoke is mounted a
        conical rotor which is spin by a small electric motor deriving
        its power from a central generator in the windmill tower. The
        arrangement is such that the wind, always blowing at right
        angles to the wheel, exerts a side pressure on the revolving
        rotors. Not only is the force of the wind on the cylinders ten
        times as great as it would be in sails of the same area, but the
        rotors respond to the slightest breezes. </p>
      <p>To utilize the wind still further, Flettner now proposes to
        attach to the outer ends of the spokes four secondary windmills
        resembling small airplanes with streamlined bodies and
        propellers set against the wind. Motors driven by these small
        propellers, the inventor has found, will develop 64 times the
        speed of the main rotor arms. </p>
      <p>Whether “blue coal” ever will supplant black coal in industry
        and commerce remains for the future to decide. In Germany, where
        nearly 75 percent of the available water power is now devoted to
        useful purposes, engineers are predicting that before long the
        nation will be obtaining a large part of its electrical energy
        from the wind. Government Electrical Engineer Foerster, in a
        recent statement in Berlin, predicted that “the time is not far
        off when forests of windmills will be centralized in various
        parts of the country to supply power and light to nearby cities
        and factories”. </p>
      <p>For the present time, Anton Flettner has succeeded, at least,
        in arousing the world to the wealth that howls about our
        windows. </p>

      <p>Judging from the interest that so many readers of the Home
        Workshop family have taken in the building of ship models, it is
        reasonable to assume that they will be doubly interested in
        building on a small scale a working model of a rotor ship, Anton
        Flettner’s sensational invention. </p>
      <p>Although the rotor and its application for propelling ships and
        windmills, as described last month in Popular Science Monthly,
        are protected by patents in all civilized countries, those who
        make miniature rotors need not fear suit for infringement. The
        inventor, during his recent visit to New York, cheerfully
        extended his permission for Home Workshoppers to build such
        models. At the same time he expressed the confident belief that
        the building of small rotor ship models not only will give the
        builders pleasure, but also will teach them intensely
        interesting lessons in aerodynmaics. </p>
      <p>Before Mr Flettner built his first rotor ship, the Buckau, now
        Baden-Baden, he prepared the round by several months of
        experiments with models. He established by tests that the
        potential propelling power of a rotor cylinder of a given
        projection surface is equal to that of a sail or sails with an
        area ten times as treat. The theory of this was explained last
        month and is again indicated diagrammatically in Figure 4. </p>
      <p>As rotors may be used on any ship, practically any hull design
        may be chosen for the rotor ship model. Those among the
        workshoppers who have had experience in building sailing models
        with find no difficulty in making a suitable hull… </p>
      <p>Anyone who has built several ship models and wishes to change
        on of them into a rotor ship may do this easily by removing the
        masts and sails and putting in their place one or two rotor
        cylinders. </p>
      <p>The rotor cylinders may be made of stiff paper, cardboard or
        thin sheet metal. The dimensions for a hull 2 ft long are given
        in Figure 5. If the hull is made larger or smaller, the rotor
        dimensions should be changed proportionally. </p>
      <p>The rotor or rotors always should be in a vertical position
        when the ship is on an even keel. </p>
      <p>In a model built for looks only, the placing of the rotor or
        rotors is a simple matter. Each cylinder is provided with a
        spindle which passes through the centers of the two end plates.
        The lower end of the spindle is inserted in a hole in the deck
        of the ship or in a small cylindrical base, slightly larger in
        diameter than the cylinder of the rotor and about 1/2 inch high.
      </p>
      <p>When a working model is attempted, some means for turning the
        rotor or rotors at a rate of 100 to 150 rpm must be provided. If
        one is content to sail the model in only one direction in
        relation to the wind, that is, with the wind either to port or
        starboard, it is sufficient to have the rotation in one
        direction. To allow the boat to be sailed back and forth across
        a pond, the mechanism must allow the direction of rotation to be
        reversed. </p>
      <p>The selection for the source of power for the rotor must be
        left to the ingenuity of the builder of the model. The most
        primitive and cheapest, but not the most satisfactory power
        plant, is undoubtedly a rubber-band motor similar to that used
        to rotate the propellers of small airplane models. </p>
      <p>One type consists of a rod about 1 ft long, with a fixed disk
        at one end and a rotatable disk at the other. Through holes near
        the periphery of each disk rubber bands are threaded from one
        disk to the other. At one end the rod is provided with a crank
        handle and a ratchet wheel. When the crank is turned, the rubber
        bands are twisted around the rod, which is held in place by the
        ratchet when the required tension has been reached. The tension
        of the twisted rubber bands would cause the rotatable disk at
        the other end of the rod to revolve as the crank is set in
        motion, were it not for the fact that it is held by a trigger.
        When the trigger is released, the wheel begins to turn and, as
        it is geared to a small cogwheel on the propeller shaft, it
        imparts to the propeller a rapid whirling motion. A similar
        contrivance may be stowed away in the hold of the ship model and
        geared to the shaft of the rotor to give the required speed. </p>
      <p>The spring-actuated mechanism of an old alarm clock may be used
        to better advantage for operating the rotor. </p>
      <p>With some ingenuity a speed governor may be installed, and a
        gear shift may be interposed between the drive wheel or shaft of
        the power source and the spindle of the rotor, so that the rotor
        cylinder may be rotated in either direction. </p>
      <p>Anyone who possesses a small electric motor driven by a
        miniature battery may consider himself particularly fortunate,
        because, wit this power plant in te hold of the model and geared
        to the rotor spindle, his ship will be able to undertake much
        longer cruises. </p>
      <p>These suggestions, which by no means exhaust the possible means
        for supplying the required motive power, make it obvious that it
        would be impractical to give definite directions for installing
        all of these motors or hooking them up with the rotor. These
        problems, different in each individual case, must be solved by
        the workshopper who undertakes to build a working model of a
        rotor ship. </p>
      <p>If the works of an alarm clock or a mechanical toy are
        selected, they should be placed as low as possible in the hold
        of the ship, so that they will act as ballast and add to the
        stability of the ship. In placing the works, it must be
        remembered that they must be wound from time to time. Do not
        locate them so that it will become necessary to dismantle the
        model to wind up the spring. </p>
      <p>Another problem is presented by the hooking of the driving
        mechanism with the rotor to give the proper speed. The simplest
        scheme is illustrated in Figure 2. In a fair wind the rotor
        should make about 100 rpm; in a gentle breeze, about 150. </p>
      <p>On the Baden-Baden the rotors are driven by individual electric
        motors, the speed of which can be regulated and controlled from
        the bridge. The best that can be done in a rotor ship model is
        to provide for a maximum speed of 150 rpm and devise some means
        --- on either the rotor or the driving shaft --- for reducing
        the speed of the rotor if the wind is stroner. </p>
      <p>Without a gear shift to make it possible to turn the rotor
        cylinder either clockwise of counter-clockwise, the ship model
        can sail only in wind coming from one direction. If you imagine
        the rotor turning clockwise, for example, your ship can sail
        only when the wind comes from the left side, facing the bow.
        Wind coming from the right would drive the ship backwards. </p>

        <p><i>Naval Officers Embody New Ideas in Odd Craft.</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>The interest with which the strange rotor ship designed by
        Anton Flettner was greeted a few months ago, when it sailed out
        into the Baltic Sea, little surpassed that of the
        spectators&nbsp; who recently watched the trial voyage of the
        first rotor ship built in America, on the Charles River at
        Cambridge, Mass. This American boat, constructed by two young
        naval officers, was the first actual demonstration in this
        country of how a revolving metal tower can replace canvas sails.
      </p>
      <p>Lt. Joseph Kiernan and W. Hastings. Students in naval
        architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were
        greatly interested in reports of the rotor ship. They decided to
        build one for themselves. They acquired an abandoned navy cutter
        about 30 feet long and 8 feet wide, and with discarded materials
        from other boats fixed up the rotor apparatus. </p>
      <p>In designing the tower they used data gathered in exhaustive
        experiments in aviation at Langley Field, VA, where for some
        time the US Army has been studying the application of the Magnus
        theory of air pressures to aircraft. The American boat employs
        the Magnus effect, just as the German boat does. </p>
      <p>The Magnus principle, as applied to a rotor boat, may be
        expressed as follows: </p>
      <p>The wind hitting the side of a rotating cylinder goes around
        with the cylinder. Decreased air friction on one side of the
        cylinder creates suction, and increased friction on the other
        side causes pressure. These two forces together, move the boat.
      </p>
      <p>The American boat differs in several respects, however, from
        Flettner’s craft. While the German inventor used two cylinders
        on his 600-ton boat, the Americans decided to use only one on
        their cutter. They believed that when two cylinders were used,
        one interfered with the other’s action. Flettner also apparently
        has come to this conclusion, for he is experimenting now with a
        single-tower system of propulsion as indicated by one of his
        latest designs --- a rotor yacht that recently appeared in
        Germany in competition with sailing yachts. </p>
      <p>The cylinder designed by Lts. Hastings and Kiernan for the
        American craft is 3-1/2 ft in diameter and 9-1/2 ft high. This
        is smaller in proportion that the tower used in the original
        Flettner ship, and it revolves at greater speed. On the Flettner
        ship, at the top of each of the cylinders, was a rim projecting
        about 14 inches. The purpose of this was to maintain the suction
        and pressure zones extending up and down the opposite sides of
        the cylinder, and to prevent air from entering these zones from
        above and disturbing them. These rims revolved with the
        cylinders. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The disk used on the top of the American rotor tower is
        stationary. The rotor tower is mounted in the middle of the boat
        on a ball-bearing base and is supported by an interior column.
        It is driven by a 5-hp motor located at its base. </p>
      <p>In the first test of the boat on the Charles River, its
        estimated speed was about 3 knots (3-1/2 mph). With the tower
        rotating at 260 rpm in a 15-mile wind, the designers believe
        their boat will attain a speed of 7 knots (8 mph). They estimate
        that it would require 10 ho to drive a boat of the same size 6
        mph by propeller. Its development is an indication of future
        rotor uses. </p>

        <p><b>By C. P. Gilmore</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The sky was blue and the wind fresh fine morning recently as I
        stepped aboard the yacht Tracker. The 42-foot craft with a
        strange, giant cylinder mounted on the forward deck was hanging
        at anchor in Edgartown Harbor in Martha’s Vineyard, Mass. </p>
      <p>A pair of legs protruded from beneath the tower, as though the
        thing was in the process of eating a man and only his legs
        remained. That wasn’t the case, of course. Lloyd Bergeson,
        president of Wind Ship Development Corporation, explained that
        his son, Henry, an engineer, was making a change. The hull
        vibrated when the tower rotated at several hundred rpm, and
        Henry was bolting in a brace to stop the vibration. He crawled
        from under the tower and announced that the rig was ready for a
        test. Then he started up a lawn-mower sized engine just aft of
        the rotor. </p>
      <p>As the engine pu-putted to life and the tower began to rotate,
        the 17-ton Tracker suddenly lurched forward and to the right and
        was soon straining against the anchor. I thought it was going to
        drag the anchor ad, with no one at the helm, go crashing through
        the scores of yachts moored throughout the harbor. Lloyd
        Bergeson, grinning widely, shouted, “Underway under rotor
        power”. </p>
      <p>That was my introduction to the Flettner rotor. Even though I
        understood the principle, it was hard to believe that that rotor
        spinning on the bow had actually propelled the boat forward. Yet
        the fact was undeniable; the yacht had lurched forward as though
        the diesel engine below decks had been started and shifted into
        gear. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Bergeson mounted the rotor on the tracker to prove to the
        maritime community that the age of wind-assisted shipping is
        about to return and that ships using strange spinning towers on
        their decks can save enormous amounts of fuel as they ply the
        world’s oceans. He has formed Wind Ship to promote the idea. And
        the world, apparently, is beginning to listen. </p>
      <p>Physicists call the force that moves the Tracker the Magnus
        Effect. It was discovered in 1852 by a German physicist, Gustav
        Magnus, who was trying to find out why spinning artillery shells
        sometimes curved in unpredictable ways. </p>
      <p>What Magnus discovered is that a sphere or cylinder spinning in
        a moving airstream develops a force at right angle to the
        direction of the moving air (se diagram). I discovered in
        Edgartown Harbor that the force has amazing power. It can
        develop hundreds of pounds of thrust on a craft the size of the
        tracker. </p>
      <p>The first attempt to drive a ship with the Magnus effect was
        made in the 1920s by another German physicist, Anton Flettner.
        He mounted two spinning cylinders, which have since been called
        Flettner rotors, on a schooner and sailed the ship across the
        Atlantic under rotor power in the spring of 1926. </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that Flettner’s rotor ship worked and at least
        one other rotor ship went into commercial service, the idea
        gradually died. “The shipping industry didn’t care about saving
        energy”, said Bergeson. “Oil was a dime a barrel and was
        replacing coal. And about that time Flettner turned to designing
        planes for Hitler”. </p>
      <p><b>Flettner Rotor Revived</b> </p>
      <p>In the early 1970s Thomas Hanson, a west Coast engineer who had
        been working on helicopter design, turned his attention to wind
        turbines. He discovered Flettner’s work and became convinced
        that many of the problems of large wind machines could be solved
        by using Flettner’s rotors in place of the usual blades. The
        result of this work appeared on the cover of Popular Science
        last August (1983). </p>
      <p>Enter Bergeson. A naval architect with a degree from MIT, he
        had spent his life in the shipbuilding industry, supervising the
        production of nuclear submarines for General Dynamics and
        functioning as general manager of two major shipyards. </p>
      <p>The 66-year old Bergeson stood on the deck of the Tracker,
        looking across the harbor with a sailor’s squint. “I had always
        wanted to sail across the Atlantic single-handed”, he said when
        I asked how he got interested in sail-assisted shipping. “So in
        1978 I did it”. He sailed his 43-foot yacht, the Cockatoo II, to
        Norway by himself. </p>
      <p>During the 31-day crossing, Bergeson thought about the shipping
        industry and became convinced that enormous amounts of money
        could be saved if ships used the wind to furnish some of their
        propulsion. They’d still have engines. But why not also have
        some sort of sail that would take advantage of wind when
        conditions were right? </p>
      <p>In 1979 he formed Wind Ship to promote the idea and, as his
        first major project, undertook a study of sail power for the US
        Maritime Administration. His report, published in 1981,
        investigated different kinds of sail-assist schemes. It
        concluded that properly designed sails could be built to operate
        from the bridge with no additional crew, that they would be
        easier to maneuver than conventional ones, that such rigs would
        benefit both new ships and retrofitted ships, and they’d save a
        lot of fuel. </p>
      <p>Bergeson put his theory to the test in 1981. He designed a 3000
        square foot sail for the 3100-ton dead weight ship Mini Lace, a
        freighter operating in the Caribean out of New Orleans. His
        calculations showed that fuel savings would average about 20
        percent. After 18 months of operation, the ship’s owner
        published the actual results. Savings had been a satisfying 24
        percent. Other companies around the world had been experimenting
        with sail assistm, notably the Japanese tanker Shinaitoku Maru
        [PS, Dec. 1980], but none did so well as the Mini Lace. </p>
      <p>Although the Mini Lace was a success, Bergeson’s original dtudy
        had investigated different types of sails. He had concluded that
        three --- including the cat rig used on the Mini Lace --- had
        great promise. Another promising type was the wing sail, which
        looks like an airplane wing standing on end. The third was the
        Flettner rotor. </p>
      <p><b>Windmill to the Rescue</b> </p>
      <p>At about the time Wind Ship had done the preliminary
        engineering of a rotor design that could be tested, BERGESON
        HEARD ABOUT Hanson’s work with the wind turbine. It turned out
        that the rotors Hanson had built were almost identical to those
        Bergeson had calculated he would need, so a Hanson rotor was
        shipped from California to Massachusetts, and the project became
        a joint enterprise between Wind Ship and Hanson’s company,
        Windfree, Inc. </p>
      <p>I first saw the joint enterprise, the tracker, that morning in
        Edgartown Harbor. The most striking thing about it, of course,
        is that rotor. It’s 42 inches in diameter and 24 feet hih. It is
        driven --- up to about 600 rpm --- by a hydraulic motor which in
        turn is driven by a hydraulic pump turned by a small gas engine.
      </p>
      <p>When the vibration problem had been solved, we got underway
        with the craft’s owner, Dave Frantz, at the helm. We were the
        center of attraction as we sailed between the rows of anchored
        yachts. With Frantz in control, the Tracker moved majestically
        through the anchorage at about 4 knots and put out into open
        sea. With about an 18-knot wind, the boat moved easily at 6
        knots under rotor power alone. By adding a little power from the
        diesel, Frantz eased it up to a little over 7 knots. </p>
      <p>Some funny things: You have to learn to sail all over again.
        The best point of sail is a beam reach --- with the wind coming
        directly from one side or the other --- because then the force
        vector generated by the rotor is directly ahead. To tack, you
        have to stop the rotor and start it again in the opposite
        direction as you go through the wind. A rotor-powered boat can
        sail to within 25 degrees of the wind. That compares with the
        ability of a conventional sail-powered vessel to sail within
        about 45 degrees o the wind. The most peculiar anomaly: As you
        sail on a broad reach --- say 135 degrees to the wind --- the
        vector moment is actually such that the boat heels into the
        wind. </p>
      <p>During the day I asked Bergeson how projected fuel savings for
        the Tracker had worked out with actual findings. He said that
        predictions were for a saving in the 20-20 percent range but
        that they had not had an opportunity to make accurate
        measurements. A week later, Tom Marriot, a member of the PS
        auto-test crew, drove to Cape Cod with the PS precision
        fuel-consumption measuring equipment and met the Tracker. Over
        the next few weeks, with the measuring equipment aboard, the
        Tracker went through a series of trials. The results are as
        follows: </p>
      <p>Power Mode --- Ave. Wind (Knots) --- Ave. Boat Speed (knots)
        --- Ave Fuel Saving (%) </p>
      <p>Rotor-Assist --- 16.1 --- 7.0 --- 44 <br>
        Rotor-assist --- 12.9 --- 6.0 --- 27 <br>
        Rotor Sailing --- 17.7 --- 5.3 --- 100 </p>
      <p>Under rotor power alone, the Tracker reached a maximum speed of
        6.1 knots in an 18.4 knot wind and a true wind angle of 122
        degrees. </p>
      <p>Bergeson is demonstrating the Tracker to fishing-boat owners,
        talking to large shipping companies, and presenting scientific
        papers at maritime conferences. And interest is growing. He now
        has a Navy contract to study the conversion of a military
        sea-lift ship to rotor-assisted propulsion. He is also
        conducting similar studies for a number of independent shipping
        companies, including major oil and cruise-ship companies. </p>
      <p>The economic potential certainly is there. Bergeson has
        calculated that the world’s shipping fleet consumes 730 million
        barrels of petroleum a year at a cost of $30 billion. If only 20
        percent of the world’s fleet adopted sail assist, the savings
        would be on the order of 91 million barrels a year --- almost $3
        billion. </p>
      <p>The payback to an owner can be astonishingly quick. The entire
        rig for the Mini Lace cost $250,000. But the owner’s records
        show that the sailassit saves $48,000 worth of fuel a year. In
        addition, average speed is increased by 5 percent, which means
        that the ship can make more trips. Extra income from this source
        was $9200. At that rate, the rig would pay for itself in a
        little over 4 years. But there’s more. On the New
        Orleans-Jamaica route, where winds are usually unfavorable, the
        fuel savings was an incredible 36 percent, and the speed was up
        18 percent. If the ship were used on similarly favorable routes,
        the payback would fall to an astonishing 1.7 years. </p>
      <p>Bergeson is totally committed to the idea of sail assist and
        thinks that it might come in three forms. The cat rig is useful
        in some applications, as demonstrated b y the Mini Lace. But the
        wind sail is more efficient and might be appropriate in many
        application. And the Flettner rotor, he believes, is the most
        efficient and can be smaller, lighter, and most trouble-free in
        operation. “As far as I’m concerned, I’m interested in findgin
        the best way for every application”, Bergeson says. “In the
        development of something like a nuclear submarine, you try two
        or three things to see which is best. When it comes to these
        sail schemes, I think they’re all winners. They are
        complementary. I love ‘em all, and I see a future for all of
        them”. </p>

        <p><b>Anton Flettner</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Anton Flettner</b> (November 1, 1885 in Eddersheim (today a
        district of Hattersheim am Main) – December 29, 1961) was a
        German aviation engineer and inventor. He made important
        contributions to airplane and helicopter design. </p>
      <p>During World War I, Flettner developed a device allowing to
        raise or lower a plane's nose for better control, today known as
        the "trim tab". </p>
      <p>Following World War I, Flettner directed an aeronautical and
        hydrodynamic research institute in Amsterdam. </p>
      <p>In the 1920s, he bought a schooner and added two rotating
        50-foot cylinders onto it, and thus was the first to build a
        propulsion system based on the Magnus effect. The ship was named
        Baden-Baden and crossed the Atlantic in 1926. It could outsail
        normal schooners under moderate to heavy winds, but was finally
        destroyed by a storm in 1931. A commercial ship, The Barbara,
        was also built and sailed to the U.S. </p>
      <p>During World War II, he headed the Flettner Aircraft
        Corporation which specialized in helicopters. </p>
      <p>Anton Flettner was also noted for his invention of the famous
        Flettner rotary ventilator, widely used on buses, vans, boats,
        campervans and trucks to assist cooling without the use of
        energy - modern derivatives of his ventilator are still
        manufactured in Britain by Flettner Ventilator Limited. The
        helicopter invention was accomplished from his wealth from the
        ventilator business, whose success also depended on the skill of
        his wife, Lydia Freudenberg Flettner. Although Anton Flettner
        built his helicopters for the German military, primarily for
        navy spotter use, his wife was Jewish. He held a personal
        relationship with Himmler who in turn had a lower ranked officer
        and his men escort her family safely to Sweden for the duration
        of WWII. His partner and confidant was Dr. Kurt Hohenemser, a
        brilliant and thorough engineer from whom the details necessary
        for the helicopter's success was derived. Dr. Hohenemser's
        father was also Jewish, yet the pair remained unharmed during
        their tenure together throughout the war as they worked to
        develop the helicopter for military use. </p>
      <p>While the final product, the Kolibri FL282 (Kolibri means
        Hummingbird) was able to be factory assembled, Flettner and
        Hohenemser insisted that they were the only ones who were
        capable to assemble the complex intermeshing rotor gearbox
        assembly. This bottleneck in production kept the FL282 from ever
        gaining a serious military role. </p>
      <p>After 1945, Flettner (along with many other aviation pioneers)
        moved to America, where he started a new Flettner Aircraft
        Corporation which developed helicopters for the U.S. military.
        Flettner's company in the US was not commercially successful,
        but his work was shared with the Army Air Corp. Many of the
        Flettner designs are found in Kaman helicopters of later years.
        Flettner died at 76 years of age in New York City on December
        29, 1961. </p>
