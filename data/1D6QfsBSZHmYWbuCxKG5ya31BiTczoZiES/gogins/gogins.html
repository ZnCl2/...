          Summary<br>
          <br>
          For many people their dream is to develop new ideas to improve
          the nation's quality of life, and an 82-year-old Salt Lake
          inventor said he has accomplished his dream.<br>

          For many people their dream is to develop new ideas to improve
          the nation's quality of life, and an 82-year-old Salt Lake
          inventor said he has accomplished his dream.<br>
          <br>
          Laird Gogins, founder of Infinity Transmissions, has been an
          inventor all his life. "I've been doing inventions since I was
          half the size of my shoes," Gogins said. He has always been
          interested in creating things.<br>
          <br>
          "Inventing is a learning process — it's working in a world
          that provides solutions," Gogins said.<br>
          <br>
          His lifetime goal was to create a transmission that runs
          smooth, is more cost-effective and environmentally friendly.
          After 35 years of experimenting, he came up with a prototype
          that fulfilled those requirements.<br>
          <br>
          "I built the ultimate transmission so I don't have to bother
          with it anymore," Gogins said.<br>
          <br>
          His son, Scott Fechner, decided to help Gogins with his
          project four years ago after seeing his prototype.<br>
          <br>
          Fechner had not been working for Gogins for about seven years
          when Gogins called and told him about the transmission.
          Fechner said he saw that Gogins had accomplished what he had
          been working on over the years through his prototype.<br>
          <br>
          "He's one of the few people that I would actually use the word
          genius," Fechner said.<br>
          <br>
          Gogins said the transmission will change the world because it
          would increase mileage in a car from 20 mpg to 30 mpg. "We
          wouldn't even need a teacup of oil from the Middle East,"
          Gogins said.<br>
          <br>
          Mark Greer, marketing director for Infinity Transmissions, has
          been working with Gogins for four years.<br>
          <br>
          "We were both looking for a solution toward making a much more
          simple compact mechanical transmission," Greer said.<br>
          <br>
          He said the transmission can go in bikes, cars, helicopters
          and anything that has a motor. "Even a blender could benefit
          from this," Greer said.<br>
          <br>
          "The man's a creative genius — he sits and dreams and these
          things just come to him," Greer said. "He's intuitive."<br>
          <br>
          Greer said it has been an adventure trying to make the message
          simple.<br>
          <br>
          "I think the joy of seeing this mechanical magnitude come to
          life was exciting," Greer said. "It's kind of a warm and fuzzy
          feeling for me."<br>
          <br>
          The transmission is starting in the industrial speed ranges,
          and they are optimistic that it will move into cars soon after
          that.<br>
          <br>
          Currently, Gogins said there are 23 foreign patents pending on
          the transmission. Fechner added the U.S.-based cycling company
          SRAM signed an agreement with Infinity Transmissions stating
          that when the product hits the market SRAM gets first dibs.<br>
          <br>
          "I can see a wave effect happening, but change always takes an
          initial investment," Fechner said. "The most difficult part is
          convincing people that it's worth the adventure."<br>
          <br>
          Chris Russell, chief scientist on the project, has been
          working with Gogins on the transmission since 1976.<br>
          <br>
          "He (Gogins) came up with the ideas of how to build the thing
          physically, and I had to figure out the shape to make it work
          — there were many crucial factors that played into it but
          Laird's ideas were the starting point," Russell said.<br>
          <br>
          According to www.auto.howstuffworks.com/transmission.htm, a
          transmission's primary job is to allow a car's engine to
          operate in four or five different speeds. The driver then
          pushes on the gas pedal to provide different in-between
          speeds. Without a transmission, a car would be limited to one
          gear ratio, and that ratio would have to be selected to allow
          the car to travel at a desired speed.<br>
          <br>
          The transmission uses gears to make more effective use of the
          engine and keeps the engine operating at an appropriate speed.
          Today's four- and five-speed automatic transmissions need
          torque converters with coolant, radiators and hoses — all of
          which cause loss of power and efficiency. Gogins invented a
          transmission that needs none of those parts.<br>
          <br>
          Gogins' transmission has two identical cams 180 degrees across
          from each other on the input shaft. The first pair of cams
          provides engine drive and the second pair of cams provides
          load drive. The first pair drives the output shaft and the
          second pair drives the engine for engine braking.<br>
          <br>
          Output speeds are varied by moving a rack gear's power takeoff
          along cam-driven oscillating levers. When the PTO is at a
          pivot point, the output speed is zero and in principle,
          Fechner said, Gogins' transmission will have an infinite
          number of gear ratios.<br>
          <br>
          Fechner added the transmission will lead to cleaner air and
          longer-lasting vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          Gogins attended the University of Minnesota where he majored
          in physics. He taught countermeasures electronics in the U.S.
          Navy during World War II.<br>
          <br>
          Gogins has interests outside the scientific field. He has
          invested a lot of his time supporting the arts.<br>
          <br>
          Gogins founded the Contemporary Gallery and School of Arts
          around 1980. The gallery had concerts and exhibits.<br>
          <br>
          Fechner was raised by Gogins from the time he was 8 years old.
          Growing up with Gogins, he said he ended up with a very
          interesting perspective on life.<br>
          <br>
          "I was raised looking at the world with much bigger eyeballs,"
          Fechner said.<br>
          <br>
          Fechner said along with being an inventor, Gogins studied
          philosophy and was an accomplished artist.<br>
          <br>
          He said working with Gogins has given him the opportunity to
          make things better.<br>
          <br>
          "He taught me how to trouble-shoot and be able to apply those
          skills in different areas of my life," Fechner said. "I'm not
          an inventor, I've just picked up a variety of skills by
          helping him."<b><b><br>

            </b></b>A constant power mechanical transmission with
          seamless, ripple free, infinitely variable torque multiplying
          outputs comprises an input shaft and an output shaft. The
          input shaft is coupled to a pair of oscillating levers whereby
          rotation of the input shaft causes oscillation of the
          oscillating levers in opposite directions. The oscillating
          levers are linked to the output shaft with one-way clutches in
          order to cause rotation of the shaft upon movement of the
          oscillating levers. The rotational speed of the output shaft
          can be infinitely varied by changing the throw of the
          oscillating levers.<b><b><br>
              <br>
              <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b><b><br>
              </b><b>1. Technical Field</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
            </b></b>This invention relates to mechanical apparatus for
          changing the speed and torque of the output shaft of a prime
          mover relative to its input shaft. More specifically, this
          invention is directed to an apparatus for providing up to an
          infinite number of seamless, ripple free changes of speed and
          torque from a power source such as a gas or diesel engine, an
          electric motor, a jet engine, a steam engine, the crank of a
          bicycle, or the like.<b><b><br>
              <br>
              <b>2. Background Art</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
            </b></b>Historically, significant efforts have been directed
          to the provision of transmission assemblies adapted for
          changing the speed and torque of a power source. Many of these
          assemblies have involved the use of ratchet drives,
          eccentrically-oriented cam assemblies, and variable length
          lever arms. Representative of past efforts in this regard are
          the structures disclosed in the following issued patents: U.S.
          Pat. Nos. 629,389; 3,803,931; 4,630,830; 4,487,085; 6,068,570;
          4,936,155.<br>
          <br>
          For example, U.S. Pat. No. 629,389 discloses a bicycle in
          which it is stated, "The gear may be changed by substituting
          larger or smaller pulleys." Thus, one would have to get off
          the bike, take out his tool kit, take-off the pulleys and
          attach new and different pulleys to change gear ratios.
          Furthermore, U.S. Pat. No. 629,389 is a one speed
          transmission.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 4,936,155 discloses a transmission to provide
          constant power, speed changing and torque multiplication. The
          invention utilizes "a variable throw cam and cam follower
          system to provide ripple free output speeds and wide ranging
          torques." The cam follower wheel makes point contact with said
          cam. With this configuration, the cam follower of the present
          transmission makes line contact with the cam, thus limiting
          torque and power capacity.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,803,931 discloses "a variable speed
          transmission device comprises an output shaft rotated from a
          first eccentric member through unidirectional couplings", thus
          rippled output speeds.<br>
          <br>
          In U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,085, "The cam is tapered from one end
          to the other to permit the gear ratio of the transmission to
          be varied in infinite increments by adjusting the position of
          the cam relative to the followers." Power must pass the power
          through a tiny point of contact greatly limiting the power
          capacity of the transmission.<br>
          <br>
          In U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,839, "A bicycle having pivoted level
          pedal system (1, 2, 45) and lever arm length or gear ratio
          (speed) change devices (3, 4, 5, 6)" is disclosed.<br>
          <br>
          The device of U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,839 does not provide any
          means for removing ripple and, therefore, cannot provide
          seamless, ripple free outputs.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 6,068,570 utilizes eccentrics 14 and 25 which it
          refers to as cams. The eccentrics 14 and 25 cannot provide
          ripple free outputs. Furthermore, the transmission of U.S.
          Pat. No. 6,068,570 does not provide means to produce an
          infinite number of output speeds.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, it would be advantageous to provide an infinitely
          variable torque multiplying, substantially constant power
          mechanical transmission that produces ripple free outputs,
          requires fewer components to assemble, is easier to
          manufacture, is adaptable to any prime mover providing ease of
          shifting, allows power shifting under load, can provide
          compression braking and can handle substantially more power
          and torque than prior art transmissions.<b><b><br>
              <br>
              <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
            </b></b>The instant invention includes an input shaft
          journaled in a restraining support or housing, one or more
          oscillators, two or more output levers driven by one or more
          oscillators. The output levers are coupled to one-way clutches
          on the output shaft. The throw on the output levers is by
          selection and infinitely variable in order to change the
          rotational speed of the output shaft.<br>
          <br>
          In one embodiment the oscillators, levers and their respective
          fulcrum blocks may be rotatably coupled on a concentric shaft
          slidably splined on the input shaft for axial displacement
          relative to the fixed location of power take-offs.<br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment the output slides are moveable and the
          oscillators are not axially moveable.<br>
          <br>
          In all embodiments the movement of the power take-off members
          may be self powered and self locking.<br>
          <br>
          Various oscillator configurations are contemplated, related
          but not limited to a slidable member on slide guides, wherein
          oscillators are adapted for back and forth linear displacement
          of a member along the length of those guides.<br>
          <br>
          In other embodiments an oscillator may be a cam wherein a
          single cam will drive two levers.<br>
          <br>
          In yet further embodiments two drive cams, 180[deg.] apart,
          may drive the two power levers.<br>
          <br>
          In another configuration, each cam drives its power lever
          while another cam is configured to keep the drive cam follower
          wheel in contact with the drive cam at all times.<br>
          <br>
          In yet another configuration a spring is used to keep a cam or
          eccentric follower wheel in contact with the cam.<br>
          <br>
          In another configuration a pair of rollers journaled on the
          power take-off ride on the lever while a spring holds the
          lever in contact with these rollers.<br>
          <br>
          In another arrangement rack gears on the output slide drive a
          pinion gears integral with overrunning clutches journaled on
          the output shaft.<br>
          <br>
          In some embodiments a single cam drives two cam followers
          180[deg.] apart kept in contact with the cam by spring forces.<br>
          <br>
          Likewise, the single cam may have an inner and an outer race,
          with one biasing cam follower wheel riding on the outer face
          and another cam follower wheel riding on the inner race with
          two cam follower wheels journaled on each independent axle.<br>
          <br>
          The instant invention may be adapted to include structures for
          selectively applying vector longitudinal force generated by
          transmission power levers directly on the cam/follower
          assemblies thereby power shifting the assemblies along the
          length of a shaft on which they are mechanically associated.<br>
          <br>
          In some embodiments the instant invention may include a
          control slide, constrained in a groove or along guide rails
          attached to the transmission housing, and integral with cam
          follower (oscillator) slide guides and fulcrum blocks
          connecting rods.<br>
          <br>
          In some embodiments the control slide is contoured with
          grooves having oppositively oriented inclined planes wherein
          rollers biased in cages against the oppositely angled inclined
          planes in the grooves function as opposed linear one-way
          clutches to lock the control slide to the housing or to
          selectively bias the rollers by moving the cage one way or the
          other wherein the lever forces generated within the
          transmission may move the control slide one way or the other,
          thus providing power shifting and automatic clamping.<br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment the one-way clutch cavities, rollers and
          cages may be in the power take-offs and automatically hold the
          power take-offs in selected positions or allow them to be
          moved by interior lever forces in one direction or the other
          on power levers.<br>
          <br>
          Screw or hydraulic positioners or the like may be used to move
          or to hold the control slide.<br>
          <br>
          One end of the cam driven lever provides zero output speed and
          maximum output torque. The other end of the lever, which may
          extend beyond the cam drive connection, provides the maximum
          output speed and a smaller output torque. Thus, the instant
          invention is an infinitely variable constant power
          transmission.<br>
          <br>
          In another embodiment, by not including a moveable control
          slide, the transmission may be used as a low cost, power
          dense, one or two fixed speed reducer.<br>
          <br>
          In yet another embodiment cam shaped links, sans cam
          followers, effectively remove ripple free selected output.<b><b><br>

            </b></b>The variable speed transmission includes a power
          input drive shaft and a variable throw crank having a zero
          throw position aligned with the input shaft. The variable
          throw crank is coupled to the input shaft for rotation
          therewith and its eccentricity with respect to the axis of
          rotation of the input shaft can be varied. A control plate,
          also referred to as a master link, is rotatably mounted on the
          crank and a plurality of clutches having input and output
          shafts are operatively connected to the control plate through
          a plurality of pitman type links, whereby the control plate
          oscillates the input shafts of the clutches upon rotation of
          the power input shaft and variable throw crank of the
          transmission. The outputs of the clutches are connected to an
          output shaft for the transmission. By varying the throw of the
          variable throw crank the ratio between the rotary speed of the
          output shaft can be infinitely adjusted from zero to a maximum
          ratio determined by the maximum eccentricity of the variable
          throw crank with respect to the axis of rotation of the input
          shaft. A preferred embodiment is to revert the above.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to variable speed transmission
          devices and more particularly to a transmission device which
          is infinitely variable over a predetermined range.<br>
          <br>
          The infinitely variable transmission of the present invention
          permits variation in speeds between the power input shaft to
          the transmission and the power output shaft, as well as torque
          multiplying and positive drive mechanical power transmission
          over an extremely broad range of speeds in either forward or
          reverse directions, from zero to several times the input
          speed. The output torque with the transmission of the
          invention is inversely proportional to the output speed with
          high efficiency throughout its entire range. And, in the
          transmission of the present construction, there is no apparent
          torque or power limit too large for the transmission to
          effectively handle.<br>
          <br>
          Although infinitely variable transmissions have been
          previously proposed, such transmissions are relatively complex
          and require a large number of moving parts, such as shown for
          example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,803,931 and 3,229,549. By the
          construction of the present invention an infinitely variable
          transmission is provided which is smaller in size and formed
          of fewer and simpler parts as compared to previously proposed
          transmissions of this type. Moreover, the transmission is
          economical to manufacture and should be far easier to maintain
          than conventional transmissions it is intended to replace. It
          is believed that the use of this transmission in an automobile
          could double the automobile's mileage by allowing the
          automobile engine to operate at its more efficient fuel
          effective low speed high torque mode more often, regardless of
          vehicle speed. It also makes the single shaft Brayton engine
          practicel. In addition, the variable throw feature of the
          present invention can be used in other types of transmissions
          apart from auto transmissions of the type with which applicant
          is principally concerned herein and the novel clutch used in
          the transmission of the present invention is an important
          element by itself, and can be used apart from the transmission
          disclosed herein. In particular, this clutch element can serve
          as a slip clutch, indexing, overrunning, or centrifugal clutch
          in many applications. The clutch element does not rely on
          mechanical parts slipping against one another or jamming as in
          a sprag clutch, and therefore will be more durable in use.<br>
          <br>
          In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a
          variable speed transmission is provided which includes a power
          input shaft and a variable throw crank rotatably mounted with
          respect to the power input shaft, but connected thereto for
          rotation with the shaft. The crank has a zero throw position
          aligned with the axis of rotation of the input shaft, and
          means are provided for varying the throw of the crank with
          respect to the power input shaft so that rotation of the power
          input shaft will cause the crank to rotate about its axis of
          rotation.<br>
          <br>
          A master link or control plate is rotatably mounted on the
          crank and means are provided for preventing rotation of the
          plate on the crank while allowing the plate to move with the
          crank as the crank rotates within the plate. The transmission
          also includes a power output shaft and a plurality of clutches
          operatively connected between the control plate and the output
          shaft for transmitting power from the plate to the output
          shaft in response to movement of the plate about the axis of
          rotation of the power input shaft when the input shaft is
          rotated and the variable throw crank is out of axial alignment
          with the input shaft. As a result, the speed of rotation of
          the output shaft is varied with the eccentricity of the
          variable throw crank pin. The above described is reverted for
          many applications.<br>
          <br>
          The above, and other objects, features and advantages of this
          invention will be apparent in the following detailed
          description of an illustrative embodiment thereof, which is to

            </b></b>A transmission for providing continuously variable
          speed and torque comprises a housing, an input shaft, a system
          of variable throw eccentrics, control means for changing
          eccentric throw of the variable throw eccentrics, connecting
          links for receiving eccentric throw from the system of
          variable throw eccentrics and transmitting it as reciprocal
          motion and removing ripple from the output, one-way clutches
          for receiving reciprocal motion from connecting links and
          transmitting it as rotational motion, and an output shaft. The
          control means comprise a control shaft rotatably disposed
          around the input shaft so that both shafts have the same
          rotational axis and with a fork fixed to the control shaft, a
          pin fixed at one end to an eccentric and engaged between the
          prongs of the fork, and means for rotating the control shaft
          with respect to the input shaft, thus changing the eccentric
          throw and the transmission ratio. Reversible and nonreversible
          hydraulic one-way clutches, means for reversing rotation of
          the output shaft, and means for compression braking are also
          within the scope of the invention.<b><b><br>
              <b><br>
              </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b><b><br>
              </b></b></b>This invention relates to a transmission for
          and a method of changing speed and torque from an input power
          source. More particularly, the invention relates to a
          transmission for and a method of selecting from an "infinite"
          number of output torques and speeds, from maximum to as low as
          zero output speed, for vehicles, industrial speed changers,
          and the like, wherein ripple, or variation in rotational speed
          induced by crank action, is removed from the output.<br>
          <br>
          Numerous devices and methods have been devised to change the
          speed and torque from a prime mover. One category of such
          devices and methods involves variable and fixed speed
          transmissions known as ratchet drives. Transmissions of this
          type include those that contain variable thro cranks, variably
          displaced fulcrums, and variable length lever arms.<br>
          <br>
          An example of a variable throw system is described in U.S.
          Pat. No. 3,915,129 by Rust. In this device, a timing cam, with
          a distance from axis of rotation to cam surface that varies
          along its axis of rotation, is used to vary valve operating
          characteristics as a function of the position of a cam
          follower along the axis of rotation of the cam. Examples of
          other such devices have been described in U.S. Pat. No.
          3,915,129; U.S. Pat. No. 3,229,546; U.S. Pat. No. 2,159,739;
          Italian Pat. No. 460047; and French Pat. No. 590,087.<br>
          <br>
          Transmissions usually have fixed gear ratios that, although
          suitable for many uses, may be inadequate when the speed or
          torque needed is not efficiently provided by available gear
          ratios. For example, if the lowest gear ratio provided by a
          transmission having certain fixed gear ratios does not provide
          sufficiently low speed or sufficiently high torque for a given
          application, then the transmission is not suitable for the
          job. Thus it would be advantageous to provide a transmission
          that can furnish an infinite number of gear ratios and,
          consequently, an infinite number of output speeds and torques,
          between zero and some maximum.<br>
          <br>
          Another problem associated with many transmissions is that
          shifting between gear ratios involves loss of power. Shifting
          gears while driving a motorized vehicle uphill illustrates
          this problem, inasmuch as the loss of power associated with
          shifting gears rapidly results in a loss of momentum. Thus, it
          would be advantageous to provide a transmission that could be
          shifted between an infinite number of available gear ratios
          without interrupting output power.<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, many industrial machines are powered by constant
          speed electrical motors. Thus, it would be desirable to
          provide an industrial speed changer that can provide a wide
          variety of output speeds and torques. Because of the large
          variety of uses for such speed changers, it would be desirable
          to have a family of industrial speed changers that could fit
          the many needs for them, yet that could be manufactured from a
          few identical parts.<br>
          <br>
          Certain applications require wide ranges in transmission gear
          ratios, such as in certain types of bicycles. Since a human
          does not generate much power except at certain pedaling
          speeds, it would be advantageous to provide a transmission
          that, efficiently furnishes a wide range of selectable gear
          ratios to allow for increased speed and distance for the same
          or less effort.<br>
          <br>
          It would also be advantageous to provide a transmission that
          is inexpensive to build, yet reliable. Such a transmission
          would be suitable for many different kinds of vehicles, from
          bicycles to motorized vehicles such as cars, trucks, buses,
          trains, tractors, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          Also, a transmission that is light in weight and has a wide
          range of transmission ratios would not only provide improved
          fuel economy, but also improved acceleration and hill climbing
          ability.<b><b><br>
              <br>
              <b>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
            </b></b>It is an object of the present invention to provide
          a transmission or torque-multiplying, constant power speed
          changer that is inexpensive, reliable, and can supply an
          infinite number of speed ratios and be easily shifted.<br>
          <br>
          It is also an object of the invention to provide a low cost,
          light weight vehicular transmission that, because of its wide
          ratio range, improves fuel economy, acceleration, and control
          ability of land, air, and water vehicles.<br>
          <br>
          It is another object of the invention to provide a low cost
          industrial speed changer that can be driven by a
          constant-speed motor and efficiently provide a wide variety of
          output speeds and torques.<br>
          <br>
          It is a further object of the invention to provide a
          transmission with a wide ratio range and high efficiency that
          would be suitable for use in a bicycle.<br>
          <br>
          These and other objects may be realized in an illustrative
          embodiment of a transmission comprising a housing, a rotatable
          input shaft for receiving a rotational input having a certain
          speed, one or more variable throw eccentrics longitudinally
          disposed on the input shaft, a mechanism for selectively
          changing eccentric throw of the eccentrics between a minimum
          throw (which may be zero) and a maximum throw, a rotatable
          output shaft for providing a rotational output having selected
          speeds and torques, one or more one-way clutches mounted on
          the output shaft, and connecting links coupled between the
          eccentrics and the clutches for transmitting motion from the
          eccentrics to the clutches to, in turn, cause rotation of the
          output shaft and for removing ripple from the output. Ripple
          is removed from the output shaft speed <br>
          by guiding the connecting links in selected paths to
          effectively change the lengths and motion of certain links so
          that rotation of the clutches is slowed or accelerated during
          certain phases of rotation to provide constant output speeds
          of the output shaft, at desired transmission ratios.<br>
          <br>
          Novel hydraulic one-way clutches may be utilized to drive the
          output shaft as the clutches rotate in one direction, and
          rewind as the clutches rotate in the opposite direction.
          Output rotation may be reversed by use of a reversible
          hydraulic clutch, by a spur gear differential, or by other
          methods.<br>
          <br>
          The transmission of the present invention may be used to
          provide compression braking for an engine driven vehicle by
          mounting the transmission in the opposite orientation to the
          drive train of the vehicle .<b><b><br>

            </b></b>The variable speed transmission includes a power
          input drive shaft and a variable throw crank having a zero
          throw position aligned with the input shaft. The variable
          throw crank is coupled to the input shaft for rotation
          therewith and its eccentricity with respect to the axis of
          rotation of the input shaft can be varied. A control plate,
          also referred to as a master link, is rotatably mounted on the
          crank and a plurality of clutches having input and output
          shafts are operatively connected to the control plate through
          a plurality of pitman type links, whereby the control plate
          oscillates the input shafts of the clutches upon rotation of
          the power input shaft and variable throw crank of the
          transmission. The outputs of the clutches are connected to an
          output shaft for the transmission. By varying the throw of the
          variable throw crank the ratio between the rotary speed of the
          output shaft can be infinitely adjusted from zero to a maximum
          ratio determined by the maximum eccentricity of the variable
          throw crank with respect to the axis of rotation of the input
          shaft. A preferred embodiment is to revert the above.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to variable speed transmission
          devices and more particularly to a transmission device which
          is infinitely variable over a predetermined range.<br>
          <br>
          The infinitely variable transmission of the present invention
          permits variation in speeds between the power input shaft to
          the transmission and the power output shaft, as well as torque
          multiplying and positive drive mechanical power transmission
          over an extremely broad range of speeds in either forward or
          reverse directions, from zero to several times the input
          speed. The output torque with the transmission of the
          invention is inversely proportional to the output speed with
          high efficiency throughout its entire range. And, in the
          transmission of the present construction, there is no apparent
          torque or power limit too large for the transmission to
          effectively handle.<br>
          <br>
          Although infinitely variable transmissions have been
          previously proposed, such transmissions are relatively complex
          and require a large number of moving parts, such as shown for
          example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,803,931 and 3,229,549. By the
          construction of the present invention an infinitely variable
          transmission is provided which is smaller in size and formed
          of fewer and simpler parts as compared to previously proposed
          transmissions of this type. Moreover, the transmission is
          economical to manufacture and should be far easier to maintain
          than conventional transmissions it is intended to replace. It
          is believed that the use of this transmission in an automobile
          could double the automobile's mileage by allowing the
          automobile engine to operate at its more efficient fuel
          effective low speed high torque mode more often, regardless of
          vehicle speed. It also makes the single shaft Brayton engine
          practicel. In addition, the variable throw feature of the
          present invention can be used in other types of transmissions
          apart from auto transmissions of the type with which applicant
          is principally concerned herein and the novel clutch used in
          the transmission of the present invention is an important
          element by itself, and can be used apart from the transmission
          disclosed herein. In particular, this clutch element can serve
          as a slip clutch, indexing, overrunning, or centrifugal clutch
          in many applications. The clutch element does not rely on
          mechanical parts slipping against one another or jamming as in
          a sprag clutch, and therefore will be more durable in use.<br>
          <br>
          In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a
          variable speed transmission is provided which includes a power
          input shaft and a variable throw crank rotatably mounted with
          respect to the power input shaft, but connected thereto for
          rotation with the shaft. The crank has a zero throw position
          aligned with the axis of rotation of the input shaft, and
          means are provided for varying the throw of the crank with
          respect to the power input shaft so that rotation of the power
          input shaft will cause the crank to rotate about its axis of
          rotation.<br>
          <br>
          A master link or control plate is rotatably mounted on the
          crank and means are provided for preventing rotation of the
          plate on the crank while allowing the plate to move with the
          crank as the crank rotates within the plate. The transmission
          also includes a power output shaft and a plurality of clutches
          operatively connected between the control plate and the output
          shaft for transmitting power from the plate to the output
          shaft in response to movement of the plate about the axis of
          rotation of the power input shaft when the input shaft is
          rotated and the variable throw crank is out of axial alignment
          with the input shaft. As a result, the speed of rotation of
          the output shaft is varied with the eccentricity of the
          variable throw crank pin. The above described is reverted for
          many applications.<br>
          <br>
          The above, and other objects, features and advantages of this
          invention will be apparent in the following detailed
          description of an illustrative embodiment thereof, which is to

            </b></b>The power transmission is a hydromechanical torque
          multiplier that is infinitely variable over its operating
          speed range. It comprises relatively few components, and is
          highly efficient in its operation. Close control of the output
          torque and speed is readily accomplished. The torque
          multiplication and enhancement between the power input and its
          output drive is a significant feature of the transmission
          hereof. It may be constructed for small power operation, as
          well as for hundreds of horsepower.<b><b><br>
              <br>
              <b>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b></b></b><br>
          The power transmission requires only hydraulic pumping, and no
          hydraulic motor. It is thus smaller, lighter in weight, and
          more economical than prior hydrostatic transmissions. Further,
          at the high speed ratio of 1:1 no oil is pumped therein. Such
          arrangement improves operating efficiency. There is no input
          to output coupling across hydraulic fluid, and oil heating
          losses are greatly reduced.<br>
          <br>
          The invention transmissions are quieter in operation, and less
          subject to wear or mal-adjustment. They span a wide variety of
          advantageous applications, as: industrial variable speed
          drives; snowmobile and vehicular transmissions; bicycle
          multi-speed transmissions. In a snowmobile for example, its
          compactness effects the replacement of the roller chain drive
          now in general use, saves space, and lowers the
          center-of-gravity of the snowmobile.<br>
          <br>
          The invention device is a torque converter which comprises an
          input shaft, siphon means associated therewith for feeding oil
          from a sump through to a pump, and the oil is ejected as a jet
          from a nozzle. The oil jet issuing from the nozzle impinges
          upon circumferentially arranged buckets which reverse the flow
          direction so as to impinge upon a runner vane. The reversing
          buckets lie axially between the nozzle and the vane. The
          runner vane is secured with the nozzle structure whereupon
          cumulative torque is derived that is added to the input
          torque. A valve is utilized to control the oil flow from the
          nozzle. The pump may be a vane type, piston type, or
          equivalent. The output drive may be gearing about the pump
          housing, or gears combined with an external housing of the
          transmission. The latter arrangement is particularly useful as
          a snowmobile transmission, as will be described.<b><b><br>

            </b></b><br>
          The present invention relates generally to apparatus and
          methods for changing speed and torque from a prime mover. More
          particularly, the invention pertains to apparatus and method
          for selecting infinite speed and torque variations for
          vehicles, wind turbines and industrial speed changers through
          selected use of a variable throw cam designed to smoothly
          produce selected, ripple-free speeds and torques.<b><b><br>
              <br>
              <b>2. Statement of the Art</b><b><br>
              </b></b></b><br>
          Numerous systems and methods have been proposed to change the
          speed and torque from a prime mover. The present invention
          relates generally to that class of variable and fixed speed
          transmissions described as ratchet drives and more
          particularly to the control mechanisms employed with such
          drives. Transmissions of this type, known previously, include
          variable throw eccentrics, variably displaced fulcrums and/or
          variable length lever arms adapted to produce speed
          variations. Such systems are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat.
          No. 3,803,931; U.S. Pat. No. 3,517,913; U.S. Pat. No.
          3,229,549; U.S. Pat. No. 3,073,173; U.S. Pat. No. 2,199,052;
          U.S. Pat. No. 2,159,739; U.S. Pat. No. 3,915,129; Italian
          Patent No. 460047 and French Patent No. 590,087.<br>
          <br>
          Some of these known systems utilize planetary arrays of
          one-way clutches while others utilize in-line arrays. Various
          means of selecting the input-output ratios of the systems have
          been proposed.<br>
          <br>
          Another known transmission is shown in U.S. Pat. No.
          4,116,083. This transmission reverts the power train so that
          the common shaft is an input shaft instead of an output or
          stator shaft. In this transmission, the housing operates as
          the output member.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 1,770,132 (Van Soden-Fraunhofen) discloses a
          gear system having cam followers positioned to ride atop a cam
          turned by an input shaft. A lateral movement of the input
          shaft displaces the followers on the cam to change the drive
          ratio between input and output shafts.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 1,954,767 (Foster) discloses a variable speed
          transmission wherein a cam is moved to change speed ratio and
          wherein followers ride on the cams.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 2,554,463 (Klamp) discloses a variable speed
          transmission having a plurality of cam followers arranged in a
          substantially circular spacing about a cam. <br>
          <br>
          Klamp suggests positioning the cam followers such that
          alternate followers are simultaneously rotated in a common
          direction during the same time period that the remaining cam
          followers are rotated in an opposite direction. This
          interrelationship facilitates the connection of adjacent pairs
          of cam followers by tension springs which act as a means of
          retaining the cam followers in contact with the cam.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 2,983,154 (Neukirch) suggests a variable speed
          mechanical transmission having a plurality of cam followers
          spacedly positioned about a centrally positioned cam. Neukirch
          discloses housing-mounted springs which abut against the cam
          followers and urge them into engagement against the cam. In
          one embodiment (FIG. 10), Neukirch suggests the placement of a
          roller on the cam follower.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 3,803,931 (Bianchini et al.) discloses a
          variable speed transmission having two sets of cam followers
          positioned in a substantially circular, spaced orientation
          about a central cam. A set of cam followers is shown
          positioned on each of the opposing sides of the disc-like cam.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 4,487,085 (Collins) discloses an infinitely
          variable transmission wherein a cam follower includes a
          rotatably mounted roller which is mounted within a yoke formed
          within the cam follower.<br>
          <br>
          In applicant's co-pending U.S. Pat. application, Ser. No.
          753,044, filed July 2, 1985, applicant has disclosed an
          Infinite Speed Variation, Constant Power, Ripple-Free
          Transmission. The disclosed transmission uses a multi-lobed
          cam, rotatably mounted on a shaft. Followers, positioned to
          engage the cams, transmit the rotation of the cams to another
          shaft through use of one-way clutches.<br>
          <br>
          While the gearing systems and transmissions described in the
          foregoing devices have proven desirable for use, it has been
          found that such devices do not always permit easy, smooth
          shifting to allow for effective selection of the infinite gear
          ratios available with the devices.<b><b><br>
              <br>
              <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
              </b><br>
            </b></b>The instant invention provides a generally
          inexpensive, reliable, and infinitely variable, easily and
          smoothly shifted transmission or torque-multiplying
          speed-changing device system.<br>
          <br>
          To provide constant power, speed changing and torque
          multiplication, the invention utilizes a variable throw cam
          and cam follower system to provide ripple-free output speeds
          and wide ranging torques. One end of the cam lobe has zero
          throw. The opposite end of the cam lobe has maximum throw.
          There are an indefinite number of different throws between
          these extremes.<br>
          <br>
          A unique control means of the invention provides a smooth,
          easy shifting of cams under the cam followers and under load
          of a type described herein. In one embodiment of the
          invention, the followers are mechanically associated with the
          cam surfaces by a structural member which provides a steerable
          anti-friction rolling action of the followers over the cam
          surfaces, while the cam is longitudinally displaced under the
          axially fixed follower(s) and while the cam turns under the
          follower(s). <br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, the cam may be axially fixed and the followers
          slidably splined onto the input shaft so that they can be
          slidably displaced. In this alternative embodiment, a similar
          structural member provides a steerable, anti-friction rolling
          action association of the cam followers vis-a-vis the cam. The
          control means provide even minute displacement of the cams
          longitudinally beneath the followers.<br>
          <br>
          The invention provides an automatically controlled
          transmission suitable for varying the propeller speed of a
          wind turbine (the propeller being the prime mover). The
          invention may also be used to provide an optimum propeller
          speed for each wind speed, to selectively stall the propeller
          by slowing it down in higher wind speeds. This permits maximum
          generator output to be maintained but not exceeded at these
          higher speeds, thereby increasing the energy output of wind
          turbines.<br>
          <br>
          The invention also provides an easily and smoothly shifted
          transmission suitable for use with a bicycle that, because of
          its wide ratio range and high efficiency, will allow a bicycle
          rider to travel further and faster while using a minimum
          amount of energy.<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, the invention provides a smoothly shifted
          industrial speed changer that can, while being driven by a low
          cost, efficient, electrical motor, efficiently provide a wide
          variety of output speeds, with output torque increasing while
          output speeds decrease.<br>
          <br>
          The invention provides a smoothly shifted vehicular
          transmission that can, because of its wide ratio range,
          greatly improve fuel economy and acceleration for cars,
          trucks, buses, trains, tractors and planes.<br>
          <br>
          Additionally, the invention provides a large family of low
          cost, efficient,fixed ratio industrial speed changers whose
          fixed ratios can be changed if necessary. A multiple variety
          of these fixed ratio speed changers can be made from a few
          identical parts.<br>
          <br>
          Structurally, the instant invention includes an input shaft
          journaled in a retaining housing. A lobed cam is splined on
          the input shaft and adapted for sliding displacement along a
          length of that shaft. One or more cam followers are pivotedly
          mounted and axially constrained to the retaining housing or,
          alternatively, to an output shaft journaled in the retaining
          housing and held in a spaced relationship with the cam.
          Various orientational arrangements of the cam followers
          relative to the cam are within contemplation. For example,
          some embodiments position the cam followers linearly in tandem
          along the length of the cam. Other embodiments, for example,
          utilizing two, three, four or more cam followers, position the
          cam followers in a generally spaced circular arrangement about
          a centrally positioned cam. In an embodiment having multiple
          output shafts, cam followers associated with a common output
          shaft may be arranged in tandem. The groups of tandemly
          arranged cam followers, each group having its respective
          output shaft, are positioned about a centrally positioned cam,
          e.g., in a generally spaced circular arrangement.<br>
          <br>
          In this alternative embodiment, the cam is axially fixed to
          the input shaft. Whereas in the first embodiment the cam is
          displaced relative to axially fixed cam followers, in this
          alternative embodiment the cam followers are displaced
          relative to an axially fixed cam.<br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, one or more cam followers are splined on the
          output shaft and adapted for sliding displacement along a
          length of that shaft. Each cam follower is urged into a
          mechanical engagement against the cam by a biasing means.
          Various types of biasing means are contemplated within the
          scope of the invention. Of those disclosed, one such means
          relies on the mechanical characteristics of compressed
          springs; a second biasing means utilizes an arrangement of
          hydraulically actuated, piston-fitted cylinders oriented to
          direct a force against each of the respective cam followers,
          thereby urging those followers into a mechanical engagement
          with the cam.<br>
          <br>
          Each cam follower is fitted with a cam contact member
          (hereinbefore described as a structural member) which may be a
          rotatably mounted wheel or anti-friction roller which is
          positionable to engage and ride upon the cam. The contact
          member may be mounted to be steerable, i.e., the wheel's
          orientation, i.e., its axis of rotation, relative to the
          structure of the cam follower may be altered. This
          steerability permits the cant or orientation of the roller,
          relative to the cam surface on which it rides, to be changed.
          A given alteration to the orientation of the wheel's axis of
          rotation induces longitudinal, axially directed forces on both
          cam follower and the cam itself. In those embodiments having a
          displaceable cam, these forces effect a displacement of the
          cam along the input shaft relative to the follower(s). In
          those embodiments having displaceable followers, the followers
          are displaced by the force. In both embodiments, the
          fixedly-mounted cam follower or cam remains axially
          stationary. The resulting displacement of the cam in the first
          embodiment or the cam followers in the second embodiment
          effects a change in the throw of the cam follower(s) as the
          rotating cam is passed beneath the cam follower(s) during the
          cam's displacement. The rim of the follower wheel never slides
          on the cam while speed ratios are changed.<br>
          <br>
          The invention discloses a steering means for controlling or
          alternatively, maintaining the contact member's orientation.
          This steering means may be actuatable externally from the
          transmission itself.<br>
          <br>
          Furthermore, the invention may include a control system which
          includes a feedback mechanism for interrelating the steering
          means with the actual position of the cam at any given time.
          After the cam follower contact member has been steered and the
          cam is thereby forcedly displaced to a desired location, the
          feedback mechanism operates to reorient the cam follower
          contact member to an equilibrium orientation, thereby reducing
          and eliminating any axially directed force application to the
          cam by the contact member at the selected ratio.<br>
          <br>
          The cam followers mechanically engage an output or reaction
          shaft by means of one or more one-way clutches. Although
          various types of such clutches may be utilized in the
          invention, e.g. sprag or roller type one-way clutches, the
          invention may further include my unique hydraulic one-way
          clutch. This hydraulic one-way clutch includes a rotor which
          is fixedly mounted on an output shaft. The rotor is rotatably
          mounted within the hollow cavity of a ring housing which, in
          turn, may be the hub of a respective cam follower. The rotor
          is spacedly positioned from the interior wall of the ring
          housing, which housing defines an oblate cavity therein. A
          plurality of extendible vanes are biasedly mounted within
          channels recessed into the structure of the rotor. An
          auxiliary channel communicates with each recess channel as
          well as the innermost part of each vane. Each auxiliary
          channel furthermore communicates with the exterior of the
          rotor between each pair of vanes. The auxiliary channels are
          adapted to selectively receive pressurized fluid and direct
          that fluid against the innermost part of the respective vanes
          and thereby forcefully displace those vanes from within their
          respective recess channels outward toward the ring housing,
          cavity-defining interior wall.<br>
          <br>
          The vanes are adapted to abut against the interior wall and
          thereby subdivide the space extant between the rotor and the
          interior wall into a plurality of wedge-shaped cross-sectioned
          subchannels. Upon a rotation of the rotor in a first
          direction, the configuration of the annular channel and the
          plurality of subchannels creates a high oil pressure within a
          plurality of the subchannels as the rotor's rotation causes
          the spatial volume of some of those subchannels to decrease.
          The resulting hydraulic pressure creates essentially a
          hydraulic or pressure linkage of the rotor with the ring
          housing whereby a corresponding rotation of the rotor in the
          first direction causes a rotation of the ring housing in the
          same direction or vice versa. The outmost parts of the vanes
          are configured so as not to include surface areas on which an
          imposition of directed forces, by the described hydraulic
          pressures, would induce a return of the vanes back into their
          respective recess channels within the rotor. When the rotor is
          rotated in the opposite direction, the ends of the vanes, due
          to their configuration, provide a surface on which the
          increasing oil pressure can act, there-by pushing the vanes
          into the rotor, and dismantling the subchannels and
          eliminating the linkage between the rotor and ring housing.
          This occurs since there is no auxiliary channel from the other
          side of the vane to allow oil pressure in under that vane.
          Absent the linkage, the rotor turns freely in the ring housing
          cavity with no related rotation of the ring housing. Note that
          the ring housing cavity is kept filled with oil through
          make-up passages leading from a lower pressure oil supply
          source. The oil is filtered during operation by a filter
          between the high pressure and low pressure areas of the
          clutch. A check valve precludes oil from flowing out of the
          high pressure area while permitting flow through the filter
          into that area.<br>
          <br>
          It should be clear that the rotor could be the driving member
          and the housing the driven member of this clutch, or vice
          versa.<br>
          <br>
          Previous cam and cam follower variable transmissions have
          varied the speed and/or torque of an output shaft by applying
          heavy displacing forces directly on the cam, thereby
          displacing it along the length of the input shaft. The instant
          invention effects such a cam displacement by reorienting the
          cant of the cam follower contact member. The rolling action of
          the cam follower on the cam induces an axially directed force
          on the cam which displaces the cam longitudinally along its
          support shaft and relative to the cam follower. In a first
          embodiment, the followers remains longitudinally fixed
          relative to the cam throughout the transmission's operation.
          In a second embodiment, the cam followers are made
          longitudinally displaceable by the reorientation of the
          contact member while the cam is longitudinally fixed.<br>
          <br>
          Two embodiments of a control screw having a feedback means
          associated therewith adapted for interrelating the orientation
          of the cam follower contact member and the cam are disclosed.
          One construction utilizes a pivoted feedback linkage which
          mechanically relates the cam with a nut mounted on the control
          screw. A given displacement of the cam operates to induce a
          measured displacement of the control screw. A second control
          embodiment makes use of a hydraulic flow valve to control
          hydraulic pressure to a piston-fitted cylinder to interrelate
          cam displacements with a follower contact member
          reorientation.<b><b><br>

            </b></b>The variable speed transmission includes a power
          input drive shaft and a variable throw crank having a zero
          throw position aligned with the input shaft. The variable
          throw crank is coupled to the input shaft for rotation
          therewith and its eccentricity with respect to the axis of
          rotation of the input shaft can be varied. A control plate,
          also referred to as a master link, is rotatably mounted on the
          crank and a plurality of clutches having input and output
          shafts are operatively connected to the control plate through
          a plurality of pitman type links, whereby the control plate
          oscillates the input shafts of the clutches upon rotation of
          the power input shaft and variable throw crank of the
          transmission. The outputs of the clutches are connected to an
          output shaft for the transmission. By varying the throw of the
          variable throw crank the ratio between the rotary speed of the
          output shaft can be infinitely adjusted from zero to a maximum
          ratio determined by the maximum eccentricity of the variable
          throw crank with respect to the axis of rotation of the input
          shaft. A preferred embodiment is to revert the above.purposes.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to variable speed transmission
          devices and more particularly to a transmission device which
          is infinitely variable over a predetermined range.<br>
          <br>
          The infinitely variable transmission of the present invention
          permits variation in speeds between the power input shaft to
          the transmission and the power output shaft, as well as torque
          multiplying and positive drive mechanical power transmission
          over an extremely broad range of speeds in either forward or
          reverse directions, from zero to several times the input
          speed. The output torque with the transmission of the
          invention is inversely proportional to the output speed with
          high efficiency throughout its entire range. And, in the
          transmission of the present construction, there is no apparent
          torque or power limit too large for the transmission to
          effectively handle.<br>
          <br>
          Although infinitely variable transmissions have been
          previously proposed, such transmissions are relatively complex
          and require a large number of moving parts, such as shown for
          example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,803,931 and 3,229,549. By the
          construction of the present invention an infinitely variable
          transmission is provided which is smaller in size and formed
          of fewer and simpler parts as compared to previously proposed
          transmissions of this type. Moreover, the transmission is
          economical to manufacture and should be far easier to maintain
          than conventional transmissions it is intended to replace. It
          is believed that the use of this transmission in an automobile
          could double the automobile's mileage by allowing the
          automobile engine to operate at its more efficient fuel
          effective low speed high torque mode more often, regardless of
          vehicle speed. It also makes the single shaft Brayton engine
          practicel. In addition, the variable throw feature of the
          present invention can be used in other types of transmissions
          apart from auto transmissions of the type with which applicant
          is principally concerned herein and the novel clutch used in
          the transmission of the present invention is an important
          element by itself, and can be used apart from the transmission
          disclosed herein. In particular, this clutch element can serve
          as a slip clutch, indexing, overrunning, or centrifugal clutch
          in many applications. The clutch element does not rely on
          mechanical parts slipping against one another or jamming as in
          a sprag clutch, and therefore will be more durable in use.<br>
          <br>
          In accordance with one aspect of the present invention a
          variable speed transmission is provided which includes a power
          input shaft and a variable throw crank rotatably mounted with
          respect to the power input shaft, but connected thereto for
          rotation with the shaft. The crank has a zero throw position
          aligned with the axis of rotation of the input shaft, and
          means are provided for varying the throw of the crank with
          respect to the power input shaft so that rotation of the power
          input shaft will cause the crank to rotate about its axis of
          rotation.<br>
          <br>
          A master link or control plate is rotatably mounted on the
          crank and means are provided for preventing rotation of the
          plate on the crank while allowing the plate to move with the
          crank as the crank rotates within the plate. The transmission
          also includes a power output shaft and a plurality of clutches
          operatively connected between the control plate and the output
          shaft for transmitting power from the plate to the output
          shaft in response to movement of the plate about the axis of
          rotation of the power input shaft when the input shaft is
          rotated and the variable throw crank is out of axial alignment
          with the input shaft. As a result, the speed of rotation of
          the output shaft is varied with the eccentricity of the
          variable throw crank pin. The above described is reverted for
          many applications.<b><b><br>
