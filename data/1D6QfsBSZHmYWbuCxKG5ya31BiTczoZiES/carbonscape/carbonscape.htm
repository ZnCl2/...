              Charcoal</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A world-first invention was unveiled in Blenheim in New Zealand
        this week with a multi-billion dollar earning potential and the
        ability to impact on carbon capture on a global scale.
        Carbonscape has developed and patented a process for
        manufacturing charcoal using microwave energy - a vastly more
        energy efficient process than what is currently used. </p>
      <p>The company has begun batch-scale production but hopes to raise
        capital to scale up to a fully-integrated continuous production.
        Carbonscape says that its technology can address existing
        biowaste streams and that it has been invited to its their
        technology on pine waste on site in commercial forests. </p>
      <p>The company is also fielding international approaches,
        including a United States interest looking at using corn waste
        as a raw material for charcoal production. Carbonscape's unit
        traps the carbon fixed in waste plant material in the form of
        charcoal, which can be returned to the soil as biochar. </p>
      <p>The invention came about when scientist Professor Chris Turney
        was attempting to cook dinner in a hurry and accidentally blew
        up the family microwave. He realised he had created pure carbon,
        and immediately saw its potential in the marketplace. </p>
      <p>Carbonspace's prototype machine, dubbed "the black phantom" was
        manufactured by a local design and engineering team, and can be
        fitted into a 40-foot shipping container. This means that it can
        be taken into remote places. </p>
      <p>"It is also possible to use the technology on a large scale
        either by combining several smaller plants or by scaling up to
        one big unit," says Carbonscape director Nick Gerritsen. "It
        could be set up on a forestry skid site with a generator," he
        says. "This means that wood waste could be processed on-site
        leaving the forest owner with only the finished charcoal to
        transport out of the forest." Source: Carbon News 200 </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; The invention provides a method for
        sequestering carbon dioxide. The method comprises cutting
        organic material into chips, carbonising the chips of organic
        material by applying microwave energy and storing the resulting
        charcoal in a carbon sink. </p>

      <p>As with all great stories it began with a potato. Longer ago
        than I care to admit, there was a time when I was a young and
        foolish teenager. Left at home on one of the rare occasions my
        parents went out, I got it into my thick skull to microwave a
        potato. Having no idea what to do, the timer was set to a
        shockingly high 40 minutes. The inevitable result was a dead
        microwave and a glowing black lump where the potato had once
        been. It was one of those painful experiences in life that one
        tries to forget but years later it opened up a line of thought.
        We need to get the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
        down, and fast. Could microwaving plant material help? Using
        patented technology, I’ve been working with a team to set up a
        new company called Carbonscape which is doing just that. </p>
      <p>As many readers will know, technology now exists to capture
        carbon dioxide (CO2) direct from any major source that emits the
        offending gas. The crucial point is that the carbon dioxide can
        be captured and stored underground; an approach commonly
        referred to Carbon Capture and Storage (or CCS). This does sound
        rather wonderful but unfortunately there are still major
        problems. There are very real concerns that CCS may not be the
        environmental solution it’s cracked up to be: this technology
        only deals with greenhouse gas emissions produced by large
        single sources, such as power stations, while the captured gases
        that are supposedly stored have the potential of escaping back
        to the atmosphere. If this wasn’t enough, CCS won’t become
        commercially available for at least another decade and can only
        capture carbon dioxide being released in the future; it does
        nothing to claw back the CO2 that is already in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>Using photosynthesis, plants are remarkably efficient absorbers
        of carbon dioxide. One alternative approach is to utilise
        natural sinks for sequestering carbon. Forests are one
        possibility. The potential of the terrestrial biosphere is
        enormous. Consider the figures. Each year we emit 8 billion
        tonnes of carbon. In contrast, 120 billion tonnes of carbon are
        sucked out of the atmosphere each year by photosynthesis on
        land. Unfortunately for us, all of this is pretty much returned
        to the atmosphere through respiration and decomposition of plant
        material. </p>
      <p>charcoalFortunately, however, we know from scientific studies
        that charcoal can store carbon for thousands of years. Ancient
        fires preserved in archaeological sites, including those found
        with ancient human remains, show carbon can be stable for
        thousands of years. This is because charcoal is highly resistant
        to microbial breakdown. Once formed, the charcoal effectively
        keeps the carbon out of the atmosphere and ocean for virtually
        indefinite periods. </p>
      <p>We’ve taken this idea a step further at Carbonscape. Developing
        an industrial-scale unit, we’re converting wood waste and other
        biomass into charcoal. Our proprietary industrial microwave
        technology means that in spite of the energy used during
        production, the carbon captured draws down significantly more
        carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it produces. Each
        industrial-scale unit converts 40-50% of wood debris into
        charcoal; one tonne of carbon dioxide can be fixed as charcoal
        per day. By converting carbon in organic material to charcoal,
        it can be then put into the ground where it does the most good.
      </p>
      <p>At Carbonscape we hope we’re adding a new commercial reason for
        reforestation. Once wood has been turned into charcoal, the
        cleared area can be replanted, allowing us to repeat the process
        when the plants have matured, effectively sucking yet more
        carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. A great example is the
        USA: if the 200 million hectares of forest used for timber
        production were turned to charcoal instead, each crop rotation
        would help bring carbon dioxide levels down by some 10 parts per
        million. And it’s not just potatoes or wood that can be turned
        into charcoal: other organic material (even sewage) can be
        turned into a permanent carbon sink. </p>
      <p>The possibilities for fixing carbon are truly enormous. </p>

      <p>Processing biomass through a distributed network of fast
        pyrolyzers may be a sustainable platform for producing energy
        from biomass. Fast pyrolyzers thermally transform biomass into
        bio-oil, syngas, and charcoal. The syngas could provide the
        energy needs of the pyrolyzer. Bio-oil is an energy raw material
        (~17 MJ kg–1) that can be burned to generate heat or shipped to
        a refinery for processing into transportation fuels. Charcoal
        could also be used to generate energy; however, application of
        the charcoal co-product to soils may be key to sustainability.
        Application of charcoal to soils is hypothesized to increase
        bioavailable water, build soil organic matter, enhance nutrient
        cycling, lower bulk density, act as a liming agent, and reduce
        leaching of pesticides and nutrients to surface and ground
        water. The half-life of C in soil charcoal is in excess of 1000
        yr. Hence, soil-applied charcoal will make both a lasting
        contribution to soil quality and C in the charcoal will be
        removed from the atmosphere and sequestered for millennia.
        Assuming the United States can annually produce 1.1 x 109 Mg of
        biomass from harvestable forest and crop lands, national
        implementation of The Charcoal Vision would generate enough
        bio-oil to displace 1.91 billion barrels of fossil fuel oil per
        year or about 25% of the current U.S. annual oil consumption.
        The combined C credit for fossil fuel displacement and permanent
        sequestration, 363 Tg per year, is 10% of the average annual
        U.S. emissions of CO2–C.<br>
