      </center>
      <p><b>TerraManus Technologies</b> currently owns three proprietary
        technologies. TerraStar® is an inflatable, molded plastic wheel
        (right) that represents a potentially transforming advancement
        in soil and water management technology which, we believe, may
        be the reconciling link between competing economic and
        environmental interests worldwide. Via a proprietary process
        called Hydra Forming, TerraStar uses lateral consolidation (not
        compaction) to create reservoirs or “weir systems” of
        geometrically ordered roughness in the soil to manage water
        flow, reduce soil erosion, and increase surface area and the
        water penetration rate into the soil, resulting in increased
        crop yields and reduced input costs to farmers. </p>
      <p>This technology works differently than other soil modification
        devices, because our weir systems are created in such a way as
        to consolidate the soil without causing soil compaction. The
        walls of these weirs are formed of various curves and angles,
        all of which increase the soil surface area and hold and control
        flowing water while allowing it to penetrate into the soil. This
        in turn leads to enhanced yields and reduced input costs.
        Moreover, soil erosion and surface ponding on fields are
        significantly reduced because rainfall and irrigation water are
        held where they fall, thereby reducing runoff and increasing the
        rate of water penetration into the soil. TerraStar has potential
        applications in agriculture, bio-fuel, real estate, land
        reclamation, and road construction. </p>
      <p>Our independent testing results revealed the following benefits
        of TerraStar usage: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;* Increased crop yields and enhanced plant quality <br>
        &nbsp;* Reduced water and chemical costs <br>
        &nbsp;* Reduced soil erosion and water and chemical runoff <br>
        &nbsp;* Improved soil quality </p>
      <p>According to Dr. Stephen, these results are driven by providing
        plants more of what they need, namely water and sunshine. The
        TerraStar performs three primary functions. First, the
        reservoirs created by TerraStar hold water in place, providing
        plants with the moisture they need. Dr. Stephen states that the
        TerraStar may improve the potential for yield in today’s
        genetically enhanced corn hybrids, given that these reservoirs
        become a microbial well which creates an optimal growing
        environment for plants. Second, TerraStar consolidates the soil,
        which reduces soil erosion and (unlike other technologies which
        compact the soil) enhances the infiltration rates of the water.
        TerraStar usage reduces the soil’s bulk density and increases
        the water-fill-pore-space of the soil by about 20%. The
        increased water-fill-pore-space allows for more moisture holding
        capacity and air movement within the soil. These enhancements
        are the equivalent of turning a two inch rainfall event into a
        four inch rainfall event in terms of available moisture for the
        plant. Third, TerraStar increases the surface area of the soil
        by approximately 30%. And as the surface area increases, the
        soil temperature increases and the benefits of sunshine are
        enhanced. This all tends to create healthier, higher yielding
        plants. </p>
      <p>The <b>TerraSystem</b>™ is a cropping technology that does in
        one pass (cultivating, planting, fertilizing and soil and water
        management with the TerraStar, partial prototype left) what
        farmers currently do in 2 to 4 passes. Multi-tasking by farmers
        can dramatically reduce labor and fuel costs, but the horsepower
        required to pull multiple implements in the field is often
        prohibitive. Limited field testing of simple prototypes
        indicates that the TerraSystem requires only about 80% of the
        horsepower required to pull a traditional subsoiler alone. </p>
      <p>The <b>TerraSaver</b>™ is a human-powered tractor and cropping
        system being developed specifically for third-world farmers. The
        tractor will be pedaled by two people and will be equipped with
        a cultivator/subsoiler, drill, broadcaster (for fertilizing) and
        TerraStars for wheels. It is intended to perform all of these
        functions, like the TerraSystem, in one pass. </p>
      <p>This technology is being designed to address the
        desertification problem that exists in many third world
        countries and provide farmers with the tools to become self
        sufficient. The TerraSaver will require no power source or
        additional inputs other than human beings, which is a resource
        these countries generally have in abundance. Moreover, it will
        be simple to use and we estimate its retail cost at less than
        $1,000.00. (Above is an even simpler horse-drawn technology.)
        While this technology is currently in the concept stage, we
        intend to pursue patents on both the TerraSystem and TerraSaver
        technologies and we believe that the TerraSaver will effectively
        enable farmers in lesser-developed countries to begin reaping
        the benefits of “precision farming” as well the TerraStar
        technology. </p>

      <p>TerraManus Technologies is one of 20 companies the Cleantech
        Group spotted in the past week looking to raise money. Find out
        more in the Pitch o’ the week. </p>
      <p>A new farming equipment invention from Liberty, Mo.-based
        TerraManus Technologies has an absorbent waffle-like effect on
        soil, rather than that of a pancake where the syrup runs off the
        sides. </p>
      <p>Using the breakfast analogy, TerraManus CFO Gregg Whittaker
        told the Cleantech Group the company’s new ground tilling system
        addresses soil erosion, water flow management and related
        environmental problems, while increasing crop yields and
        reducing input costs to farmers. And the company, which is
        currently pre-revenue, expects that status to change before the
        end of the month. </p>
      <p>“The concept is very simple, but the science behind it is very
        complex,” he said. “Each curve on the wheel maximizes the water
        flow, and consolidates rather than compacting the soil.” </p>
      <p>The company’s invention, called the TerraStar, is essentially
        an inflatable, molded plastic wheel. It uses consolidation to
        create reservoirs that are walled by various curves and angles.
        The result helps to increase the surface area of the soil by
        about 35 percent as well as boosting the water penetration rate
        into the soil, the company claims. </p>
      <p>Whittaker said farmers have been able to reduce water and
        fertilizer needs by 10 to 30 percent. And increased crop yields
        have been as much as 42 percent for tomatoes and 12 percent for
        corn, for which demand has been steadily growing in recent years
        (see American farmers plan to plant more corn this year). </p>
      <p>The TerraStar has potential applications in agriculture,
        biofuel, real estate, land reclamation and road construction.
        It’s an embodied technology, Whittaker said, meaning it works
        within the existing framework of farming operations, as opposed
        to requiring farmers to change how they farm. The company has
        patented its technology in the United States, and is finalizing
        global coverage. </p>
      <p>TerraManus, a research and development company founded in 2005,
        is developing strategic partners to distribute its invention,
        which retails for about $90 for one wheel. </p>
      <p>The company is seeking $500,000, most likely from angel
        investors, to continue its research and commercialization
        efforts. </p>
      <p>The company wants to build and expand its marketing strategy
        with companies including Hutchinson, Minn.-based agriculture
        attachments manufacturer May Wes and other strategic partners.
        May Wes makes three universal farming attachments that work with
        the TerraStar, and is already selling the TerraStar. </p>
      <p>The TerraStar can be attached to both machine and human-powered
        equipment, and was developed with U.S. and European high-tech
        industrialized farming in mind. </p>
      <p>“We discovered very quickly that it could be used by farmers in
        less developed countries as well,” Whittaker said. </p>
      <p>The company’s TerraSaver is a human-powered tractor and
        cropping system being developed for third-world farmers.
        Whittaker said the company is working on manufacturing and
        distributing its technology in Kenya. </p>
      <p>The company’s research has been conducted at Martinsville,
        Ill.-based Arise Research &amp; Discovery and in Mexico, where a
        bean crop was tested over five years on a control plot. During
        one of those years, Mexico experienced a drought. But because
        the TerraStar increased the soil’s moisture content, though the
        plot received little rain, it “looked like an oasis in the
        middle of a desert,” Whittaker said. </p>
      <p>With additional funds, Whittaker said the company wants to
        expand the technology’s applications in twin-row planters, where
        crops are planted in twin rows and essentially double the amount
        of yield per acre compared to standard rows. But the soil
        currently can't support it because there aren't enough soil
        nutrients. TerraManus believes the TerraStar could change that.
      </p>
      <p>The market potential for the company’s technology is large and
        growing, Whittaker said. Of the $100 billion in worldwide ag
        equipment sales every year, $22 billion of that is in North
        America. Of that, $13 billion of that market worldwide and $2.5
        billion in North America could benefit from TerraStar’s
        equipment, Whittaker said. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A soil conditioning device having a
        series of peripheral ridge members having a leading and trailing
        prow shaped surface circumscribing a disc, wheel or drum and a
        method of use. Optionally the prow shaped peripheral ridge
        members are joined by sub-ridge members forming a single ridge
        of varying heights circumscribing the disc, wheel or drum. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to soil conservation, more specifically
        toward an apparatus for conditioning surface soils thereby
        increasing infiltration. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Related Art</b> </p>
      <p>Traditional farming comprises tasks such as plowing, disking,
        harrowing, seeding, fertilizing, and harvesting. During this
        farming process, soil is often left in a loose condition where
        the soil is subject to moisture evaporation and erosion. There
        is an increased demand to accomplish these farming tasks in a
        manner to conserve the soil by reducing erosion and to conserve
        the water by increasing the infiltration capability of the soil.
        Additionally, there is a demand to multitask these operations
        such that several tasks can be accomplished in a single pass
        over the land thus improving the efficiency of the farming
        operation and reducing costs. Due to the increasing demand for
        soil and water conservation as well as multitasking in farming
        and land management practices, it has become necessary to design
        machinery and supporting systems. </p>
      <p>Traditionally, soil erosion and surface water management has
        been attempted with diking, imprinting and compacting systems,
        and reservoir tillage systems. These systems have been designed
        for the purpose of sealing the soil surface and/or retaining
        water where it falls thus reducing erosion. There are many forms
        of equipment available today that attempt to create irrigation
        pools and reservoirs in the soil surface. Examples of processes
        which use equipment to compact the soil into pools include
        furrow irrigation, diking, compacting and punching, spading and
        scooping, imprinting and impressing. All of these processes
        incorporate devices that can be mechanically driven or ground
        driven and can be linear or rotary in their operation. However,
        these traditional processes and associated devices fall short of
        providing a system or device which reduces erosion, reduces
        water runoff, increases water infiltration, and allows
        multitasking. </p>
      <p>Imprinting and compacting devices compact the soil to overcome
        erosion by creating pools. These devices require excessive
        weight to be applied perpendicular to the soil surface, allowing
        the soil structure to be impressed in order to make their
        imprints. An example of an imprinting machine is the Dixon Wheel
        Roller.TM. which is designed to have the required weight to
        overcome the soils surface structure in order to make an
        impression. As a result of the compaction, the soil surface is
        sealed which causes the soil surface to become substantially
        impervious to water infiltration. </p>
      <p>Compaction in soil is the direct result of weight applied to
        the soil surface. Compaction occurs quite frequently on farmland
        because of the type of equipment used, such as a moldboard plow
        or imprinting and compacting devices. Further compaction is
        caused by high traffic, tractors, carts, etc. on the soil
        surface. This compacted soil surface is commonly known as hard
        pan. When weight is applied to the soil, the soil structure is
        compressed. The greater the weight or load to the soil, the
        greater the amount of compaction. Compaction causes the surface
        soil to become compressed to such a level that it becomes
        substantially sealed and impervious to water. The top soil below
        the compacted surface soil is consequently substantially sealed
        off and has little water for infiltration. This in turn leads to
        a reduction in replenishing of water in the underlying aquifer
        which has contributed to the current water supply problems.
        Additionally, farmers need use equipment such as Rippers.TM.,
        SubSoilers.TM., or Pan Busters.TM. to penetrate below the hard
        pan and fracture it to allow moisture to infiltrate and
        therefore promote root systems on the crops. This practice does
        little to provide a system which reduces water runoff, increase
        water infiltration, or allow multitasking. </p>
      <p>More recently, imprinting type machines have been designed to
        require less weight to make an impression in the soil surface in
        an effort to overcome some of the associated problems. Even
        though these more recently designed machines are lighter than
        the Dixon Wheel.TM. and other similar devices, they are all
        still relatively heavy and decrease water infiltration
        capabilities of the soil. </p>
      <p>Soil diking systems and devices have been designed to overcome
        some of the problems associated with the imprinting and
        compacting systems. Diking is accomplished by scooping, digging,
        and/or dragging the soil which is then left in a loose condition
        to form pools or reservoirs. Less weight is needed for diking
        than imprinting or compacting devices in an attempt to leave the
        soil surface more pervious to water. However, when water is
        applied to the loose soil it impacts and dislodges the fine
        particles of soil and organic matter on the sides of the dikes
        and washes them into the bottom of the pools. These particles of
        soil then seal the bottom of the pools which reduces the
        infiltration capability of the soil and diminishes the reduction
        of runoff. Additionally, the loose soil is eroded from the field
        in both light and heavy rainfall events. </p>
      <p>Another recent attempt to provide soil and water conservation
        in farming has been the practice of no-till farming. No-till
        farming is where the soil is left undisturbed from harvesting to
        planting. Planting is accomplished in a narrow seedbed or slot
        created by disc openers. Coulters, residue managers, seed
        firmers, and modified closing wheels are used on the planter to
        provide adequate seed to soil contact. However, there are
        several disadvantages associated with no-till. No-till requires
        the use of herbicides to eliminate competition from weeds which
        raises production costs. Crop residue left on the soil hinders
        soil warming and drying, making planting more difficult and
        reduces seed germination. Conventional tillage systems cannot be
        used to incorporate fertilizers and herbicides. The heavy
        residue or foliage left on the land may result in poor seed soil
        contact thus reducing seed germination. Also, the soil surface
        is not left in a highly permeable state resulting in rain water
        runoff and reduced infiltration to subsurface soils and the
        underlying aquifer. </p>
      <p>Most recently, reservoir tillage systems such as the one taught
        in U.S. Pat. No. 5,628,372 ('372) have been devised to overcome
        the problems associated with the aforementioned farming
        practices. '372 teaches an agricultural instrument having a
        series of multifaceted peripheral ridge members having flat
        leading and trailing edges selectively spaced circumscribing a
        disc. The ridge members have a flat circumferential section
        spacing therebetween. The configuration of the '372 device
        compacts the soil to form water retaining pools in the soil from
        the vertical impact of the ridge member on the soil upon
        rotation. This compaction reduces water infiltration into the
        soil. Additionally, the flat trailing edge of the multifaceted
        peripheral ridge member pitches the soil at rotation velocities
        necessary for efficient farming practices. This pitching of the
        soil fills in the created pools with fine particles that seal
        the bottom of the pools which further reduces the infiltration
        capability of the soil. Furthermore, pitching of the soil
        destroys a portion of the structure of the pool leading to early
        failure of the remaining pool structure. </p>
      <p>There remains a need for improving soil and water conservation
        as well as providing for efficient farming practices, such as
        multitasking, and land management practices. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention is comprised of a soil conditioning
        device having a series of prow shaped peripheral ridge members
        optionally joined by sub-ridge members circumscribing a disc,
        wheel or drum. When the soil conditioning device is rolled
        across the soil surface, a series of consolidated prow shaped
        hollows and optional weir formations are created in the soil
        enhancing soil permeability and reducing water runoff. Rolling
        of the soil conditioning device across the soil surface may be
        accomplished with a mechanized, human, or animal powered
        apparatus. The soil conditioning device may serve as the wheels
        for the apparatus rolling the soil conditioning device or
        passively pulled with the apparatus. Preferably a transport
        means such as a tractor will pull a cylindrical rolling tool
        having a plurality of soil conditioning devices mounted thereon.
        The primary purpose of the soil conditioning device is enabling
        the soil to retain rain water where it falls and consequently
        reduce erosion and increase water retention and infiltration of
        the soil and provide for multitasking capabilities. </p>
      <p>The soil conditioning device is a rotary device which can be
        attached to most any existing agricultural and horticultural
        machine and may also be attached to any specially designed
        machine for use in construction, mining or other situations
        which require earthworks, including home gardening.
        Additionally, the soil conditioning device may be fitted to an
        animal or human powered device such as tri-wheeled vehicle
        having soil conditioning devices serving as wheels. Several soil
        conditioning devices may be adjacently aligned to form a soil
        conditioning tool in the form of a cylindrical roller having a
        plurality of soil conditioning devices. The device or tool is
        driven or rolled while being in contact with the ground forming
        a series of prow shaped hollows and optional adjoining weirs.
        Additionally, the soil conditioning device or tool can be fitted
        with a ratchet release, break or clutch device, or can be driven
        mechanically from a variety of sources at speeds necessary for
        multitasking. </p>
      <p>The soil conditioning device is comprised of a relatively
        lightweight material. Such materials may include wood,
        polyurethane foam, rubber, silicon rubber, synthetic rubber,
        Hytrel.TM., urethane, various plastics or polymeric materials,
        and combinations thereof. Preferably, the soil conditioning
        device is manufactured from plastic or polymeric materials such
        as high density polyethylene (HDPE), polyvinyl chloride, vinyl,
        or other such moldable plastic materials. HDPE has been found to
        be advantageous since it is a material which is light weight,
        strong, flexible and exhibits self cleaning capabilities when
        applied to the soil. Optionally, the use of UV-stabilizers such
        as carbon black may be added to improve its weather resistance.
        Combinations of various polymeric materials have also exhibited
        the desired properties of being relatively lightweight and a
        having a degree of flexibility. </p>
      <p>The soil conditioning device is molded producing a circular
        outer skin having a series of prow shaped peripheral ridge
        members optionally joined by sub-ridge members surrounding a
        hollow core. This design and material of manufacture allows the
        shape, hardness, and weight to be adjusted at its point of use
        by a farmer or other user for various soil types. This
        adjustability enables it to work efficiently in a variety of
        conditions. The adjustment is accomplished by filling the hollow
        core through a valve in the soil conditioning device. The core
        may be filled with compressed air or other gases, water or other
        liquids, gels, solids, expanding foam, a mixture of air and
        water, or any combination thereof to obtain the desired shape,
        hardness, and/or weight. </p>
      <p>The soil conditioning device molds or consolidates the soil
        upon which it is rolled or driven upon by applying light
        pressure to the soil surface in a substantially horizontal
        direction so as to lightly consolidate or bind the outermost
        surface of the soil together. Consolidating the soil surface
        lightly sticks the outermost surface soil particles together
        leaving a porous permeable soil surface for greater infiltration
        capabilities. As the device travels through the soil, the soil
        flows over and around the various component surfaces of the
        device restructuring the soil to a desired form. While the soil
        flows over and around the various surfaces, the soil is caused
        to lift and flow in a bow wave fashion behind the device or tool
        having a plurality of devices. While the soil is in the flowing
        state, the device is rotating within the soil flow and forming,
        ushering, and gently kneading the soil while ushering it into
        place producing a series of consolidated hollows and optional
        weirs, therefore leaving the soil surface in a "Geometric
        Ordered Roughness (GOR), necessary for the control of erosion
        caused by water and wind, in a process known as "Hydroforming".
        This process of consolidating the soil requires little or no
        additional pressure or force perpendicular to the soil surface
        thus providing little or no compaction to the surface soil. The
        consolidation is accomplished in a substantially lateral
        direction and shapes a structure in the soil consisting of
        various curves and angles forming prow shaped hollows and
        optional adjoining weirs which increases the soil surface area.
        The increase in permeability and surface area of the soil
        surface both contribute to the increase in soil infiltration and
        consequent reduction in erosion. Additionally, the prow shape of
        the ridge allows for the device to be operated at speeds
        necessary for efficient farm practices. </p>
      <p>The soil conditioning device of the present invention
        consolidates the soil surface into a series of permeability or
        porous prow shaped hollows and optional adjoining weirs
        controlling water flow and increasing the surface area of the
        soil contacting rain water thus increasing the effective
        infiltration rate of the soil. These prow shaped hollows and
        optional adjoining weirs are designed to slow and/or stop
        flowing water while allowing it to infiltrate the soil. These
        structures are consolidated evenly over their entire surface of
        the soil increasing the surface area of the soil and increasing
        the infiltration rate of the soil. Additionally, increase
        surface area increases soil warming from the sun allowing for
        improved seed germination. Below this molded or consolidated
        surface, the soil structure remains loose thus allowing water to
        percolate throughout the soil. These prow shaped hollows and
        optional adjoining weirs increased porosity, infiltration rate,
        and water absorbing capability of the soil directly reducing
        erosion of the soil by substantially eliminating and/or slowing
        water runoff. Additionally, surface ponding on fields is reduced
        since rainfall or irrigation water is more easily absorbed by
        the soil having a higher porosity and surface area in contact
        with the water. </p>
      <p>The soil conditioning device has many applications and
        benefits. It is capable of working on most all soil types and
        agricultural applications, such as planting, surface water
        control, soil warming, reducing wind erosion, cultivating and
        plowing, or common construction applications, such as scraping,
        building berms, reclaiming land, or even creating meridians
        between interstate highways. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows soil conditioning device 100 having a series of
        prow shaped peripheral ridge members 104 joined by sub-ridge
        members 110 circumscribing wheel or disc 102. Each of the
        plurality of ridge members 104 has a leading prow shaped surface
        106 and a trailing prow shaped surface 108. Spanning between
        each leading surface 106 and trailing surface 108 is a subridge
        member 110. This embodiment of the soil conditioning device may
        also be described as a wheel member 102 having a central
        continuous outer peripheral ridge of varying heights about wheel
        member's 102 circumference. The peripheral ridge is formed by
        prow shaped peripheral ridge members 104 having leading prow
        shaped surface 106 and trailing prow shaped surface 108. Ridge
        members 104 are joined or interposed by sub-ridge members 110
        and have a rounded top surface and side walls 114 and 116
        sloping toward wheel member 102. </p>
      <p>Soil conditioning device 100 is shown circumscribing wheel 102
        and being of a unitary material having a hollow interior.
        Preferably, soil conditioning device 100 is formed with a
        polymeric material. More preferably, the polymeric material
        forming the soil conditioning device of the present invention is
        high density polyethylene. Optionally, a UV-stabilizer such as
        carbon black may be added to the polymeric material to improve
        its weather resistance. </p>
      <p>Valve 112 is shown is shown in a sloping sidewall 114 of ridge
        member 104 and provides injection access to the inner core of
        device 100. Compressed air or other gases, liquids, gels,
        solids, or any combination thereof may be injected into the
        inner core through valve 112 to obtain a desired shape,
        hardness, and/or weight of device 100. </p>
      <p>Rolling or driving soil conditioning device 100 upon the soil
        surface creates a permeable soil surface having a series of
        weirs and an increased surface area improving infiltration and
        controlling water flow thereupon. The soil surface is
        consolidated improving resistance to movement of soil particles
        by moving water while increasing permeability thus increasing
        infiltration capability of the soil. The weirs slow and direct
        the flow of water upon the soil surface, resulting in a
        cascading effect. This cascading effect reduces the inertia of
        the flowing water minimizing the soil's erosion. These soil
        structures increase the soil surface area and decrease water
        run-off. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows soil conditioning device 200 having a plurality of
        prow shaped peripheral ridge members 204 selectively spaced
        about a peripheral surface of disc or wheel or disc 202. Each of
        the plurality of ridge members 204 has a leading prow shaped
        surface 206 and a trailing prow shaped surface 208. Soil
        conditioning device 200 may also be described as wheel member
        202 having a series of central disjointed outer peripheral ridge
        members 204 wherein each peripheral ridge member 204 has a prow
        shaped leading end 206, a prow shaped trailing end 208, and two
        opposing sloping sidewalls 214 and 216 sloping toward wheel 202.
      </p>
      <p>Soil conditioning device 200 is shown circumscribing wheel 202
        and being of a unitary material having a hollow interior.
        Optional valve 212 is shown in wheel 202 providing material
        access to the core of device 200. Rolling soil conditioning
        device 200 upon the soil surface consolidates the surface soil
        laterally into a series of preselectively spaced prow shaped
        hollows. </p>
      <p>FIG. 3 shows soil conditioning device 100 of FIG. 1 having prow
        shaped ridge members or sections 104 interposed with subridge
        members or sections 110 circumscribing wheel or disc 102.
        Interposed ridge members 104 and subridge members 110 form a
        central continuous outer peripheral ridge of varying heights
        circumscribing wheel 102. Ridge sections 104 are of a primary
        height h.sub.2 and subridge sections 110 are of a secondary
        height h.sub.1. Primary height h.sub.2 is greater than secondary
        height h.sub.1. Preferably, h.sub.2 exceeds h.sub.1 in a range
        of approximately 1.5 inches to 5 inches. Also in this
        embodiment, each ridge section 104 has a primary height h.sub.2
        extending continuously about the circumference of wheel 102 (l)
        in a range of about 5 inches to 10 inches. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 shows a front view of soil conditioning device 100 with
        prow shaped ridge members 104 and subridge members 110
        circumscribing wheel 102. Shown here are opposing side walls 114
        and 116 of ridge member or section 104 having an angle .alpha.
        therebetween. Preferably angle .alpha. is in a range of
        approximately 40.degree. to 80.degree., and more preferably is
        approximately 60.degree.. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 shows soil conditioning tool 500 incorporating a
        plurality of the soil conditioning devices 100. Soil
        conditioning devices 100 are axially aligned and retained
        forming cylindrical rolling tool 500. In the embodiment shown,
        soil conditioning devices 100 are adjacent one another in a
        staggered ridge member 104 alignment. However, soil conditioning
        devices 100 may be in a spaced configuration on cylindrical
        roller 510 and may as well be in a configuration having ridge
        members 104 aligned radially about cylindrical roller 510.
        Attaching hubs 512 extend axially from each end of cylindrical
        roller 510 for rotatingly attaching to a transport means such as
        a tractor or as the last device in a multitasking train of
        farming tools, or optionally placed in various positions within
        the train of farming tools, providing for an efficient method of
        soil and water conservation easily incorporated into current
        farming practices. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 shows a top view of soil conditioning tool 600
        incorporating a plurality of the soil conditioning devices 100
        of FIG. 1 for use after planting. Soil conditioning devices 100
        are axially aligned, spaced, and retained forming cylindrical
        rolling tool 600. A plurality of pairs of soil conditioning
        devices 100 are adjacent one another in a staggered ridge member
        104 alignment on cylindrical roller 602. However, soil
        conditioning devices 100 may be spaced having three, four or
        even more soil conditioning devices 100 adjacently aligned and
        the spacing between adjacent devices 100 may vary depending upon
        the size of the plants. Cylindrical roller 602 may be in a
        configuration having ridge members 104 aligned radially about
        cylindrical roller 602. Attaching arm 604 extends radially from
        a center portion of cylindrical roller 602 for rotatingly
        attaching to a transport means such as a tractor or as the last
        device in a multitasking train of farming tools. </p>
      <p>FIG. 7 shows a top view of soil imprint 700 formed by soil
        conditioning tool 500 of FIG. 5 or other device having at least
        one soil conditioning device incorporated therein. Having soil
        conditioning tool 500 driven (i.e. used as a powered wheel) or
        rolled (i.e. passively pulled or pushed) by mechanical, animal,
        or human power upon the surface soil while being in contact with
        the ground consolidates the soil into a series of prow shaped
        hollows 704 and adjoining weirs 702. Leading end 708,
        mid-section 710, and trailing end 706 make up hollow 704 and are
        formed by sections or walls 106, 114, 116, and 108 of device 100
        respectively. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 shows a cross-sectional view of soil being conditioned
        by soil conditioning device 100 of FIG. 1. Shown here are force
        vectors 800 primarily in a lateral direction consolidating the
        soil surface. As device 100 rolls upon the land, leading prow
        shaped surface 106 makes contact with the soil and as device 100
        continues to roll, leading prow surface 106 and ridge member 104
        laterally consolidates the soil as shown by force vectors 700.
        Having prow shaped leading edge 106 first contacting the soil
        allows the soil to be consolidated with less than about fifty
        pounds force per ridge member 104. Additionally, having trailing
        surface 108 in a prow shape allows device 100 to move about the
        soil surface at speeds of up to about 14 mph without throwing or
        pitching the soil. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8a shows a plan view of the soil having been conditioned
        by soil conditioning device 200 of FIG. 2. Shown here are force
        vectors 812 indicating the lateral direction of consolidation
        and primarily showing the forward and rearward direction of
        consolidation achieved by the prow shaped ridge members 204
        forming a series of prow shaped hollows 804. Prow shaped hollows
        804 have leading end 808, mid-section 810, and trailing end 806
        and are formed by sections or walls 206, 214, 216, and 208 of
        device 200 respectively. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 9 and 9a show a cross-sectional view of soil conditioning
        device 100 in an expanded state and a retracted state
        respectively. Having soil conditioning tool 100 comprised of a
        flexible material such as a polymeric material and formed having
        a hollow center or cavity allows ridge member 104 to retract
        when device 100 encounters a radial force as is likely when
        device 100 encounters a rock or other hard material within the
        surface soil. The force required to retract ridge member 104
        within device 100 may be adjusted by filling core 900 of device
        100 with compressed air or other gases, liquids, gels, solids,
        or any combination thereof to obtain a desired hardness. This
        retractability of ridge member 104 provides that a substantially
        consistent horizontal force within the surface soil is provided,
        hence uniform consolidation is achieved. A retraction of l.sub.1
        less l.sub.2is possible without substantially altering the
        configuration of ridge members 104. </p>
      <p>The present invention is a soil conditioning device having a
        series of prow shaped peripheral ridge members optionally joined
        by sub-ridge members circumscribing a disc, wheel or drum and a
        method for creating a permeable soil surface. The prow shape
        peripheral ridge members consolidate the soil in varying degrees
        from the top of the impression to the bottom of the impression
        which increases water infiltration and reduces soil erosion. At
        the top of the impression the soil is at a greater risk of
        erosion by surface water run-off, therefore the soil is
        consolidated to a greater degree. At the bottom of the
        impression the risk of erosion is considerable reduced and as a
        maximum infiltration rate is required to absorb the accumulating
        water, the soil is consolidated to the minimum to enable the
        soil to stay in place, allowing maximum percolation of the
        accumulating water by interstitial flow. When the soil
        conditioning device is moved on the land the prow shaped ridge
        member enters the soil sweeping the soil sideways so as to
        consolidate the soil laterally. This is in contrast to
        compacting the soil as is the case in more traditional devices.
        Furthermore, as the device leaves the soil, this sideways
        sweeping action consolidates the soil laterally at the front of
        the impression leaving the impression in a stable condition
        structurally and allowing for the maximum water infiltration and
        percolation. This is in contrast with the more traditional
        systems where the soil is left loose and highly erodeable as the
        devices exit the soil. <br>
