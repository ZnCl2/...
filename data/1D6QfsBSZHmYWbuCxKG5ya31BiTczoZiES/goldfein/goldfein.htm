      <p><b>Abstract ~ </b>The purpose of the study was to determine
        whether recent disclosures of elemental transmutations occurring
        in biological entities have revealed new possible sources of
        energy. The works of Kervran, Komaki, and others were surveyed;
        and it was concluded that, granted the existence of such
        transmutations (Na to Mg, K to Ca, and Mn to Fe), then a net
        surplus of energy was also produced. A proposed mechanism was
        described in which Mg-Adenosine Triphosphate (MgATP), located in
        the mitochondrion of the cell, played a double role as an energy
        producer. In addition to the widely accepted biochemical role of
        MgATP in which it produces energy as it disintegrated part by
        part, MgATP can also be considered to be a cyclotron on a
        molecular scale. The MgATP when placed in layers one atop the
        other has all the attributes of a cyclotron in accordance with
        the requirements set forth by E.O. Lawrence, inventor of the
        cyclotron. </p>
      <p>It was concluded that elemental transmutations were indeed
        occurring in life organisms and were probably accompanied by a
        net energy gain. </p>

      <p><a name="intro"></a><b>Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p><b>(1) Subject ~</b>&nbsp; The subject of this study was to
        determine whether recent disclosures of elemental transmutations
        occurring in biological entities have revealed new possible
        sources of energy. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Background ~</b>&nbsp; Two investigators, Kervran and
        Komaki (1, 2), have recently been nominated for a joint Nobel
        prize for their work involving the experimental proof that
        elemental transmutations were occurring in life organisms.
        Elements which were definitely proven to have been transformed
        were sodium (to magnesium), potassium (to calcium), and
        manganese (to iron). Actually, observations have been made for
        almost 200 years that elemental transmutations were occurring,
        but little credence was given to them because they resembled
        alchemy --- a relic of the idle ages. </p>
      <p>[(1) Kervran, C.L.: <i>Prev. en Biologie de Transmutation a
          Faible Energy</i>; Maloin, Paris (1975); (2) Komaki, H.: <i>Rev.







          de Pathologie Comparee</i> 67: 213 (1967); 69: 29 (1969)] </p>
      <p>From Jeuneman (3), investigations on transmutations can be
        traced from 1799 to the present. </p>
      <p>[(3) Jueneman, F.B.: <i>Industrial Research</i> 19 (13): 11
        (Dec. 1977), "The Transmutation of Species".] </p>
      <p>The French chemist, Vauquelin, in 1799, observed a large
        quantity of lime in the daily excretion of hens. To determine
        where the lime was coming from, he fed a captive hen a diet of
        nothing but oats. He measured the amount of lime in the oats,
        fed the oats to the hen, and then measured the amount of lime in
        the excretion and the eggs of the hen. The lime had increased
        fivefold. Vauquelin realized that lime had been created but he
        did not know why. </p>
      <p>In 1822, Prout, an English experimenter, defined the
        transmutation of elements by studying incubating chicken eggs.
        He observed increasing amounts of calcium carbonate inside the
        egg and determined that the compound did not come from the
        shells. </p>
      <p>In 1831, Choubard experimented with germinating watercress
        seeds. He observed new minerals in the young plants that were
        not present in the original seeds. </p>
      <p>In 1844, Vogel also worked with watercress seeds. He placed his
        seeds in a controlled-air environment and added a sulfur-free
        nutritive solution to the seeds. The plants that grew from the
        seeds were found to have more sulfur than the original seeds.
        Vogel's answer was that sulfur was not a simple element or that
        sulfur was introduced from sources unknown. </p>
      <p>After Vogel, Lauwes and Gilbert observed the weight variation
        of ashes during vegetation. In particular, they found a
        variation in magnesium. </p>
      <p>In 1875, von Herzeele also studied vegetating plants and
        discovered a weight increase in the ashes of the young plants. </p>
      <p>Later, following the works of Vogel and Lauwes and Gilbert, von
        Herzeele considered the variation in the weight of magnesium. He
        concluded that a transmutation of elements had taken place. </p>
      <p>In 1960, Baranger, of France, published his findings on
        variations of calcium and phosphorus in germinating seeds. He
        also concluded that a transmutation had taken place, but he did
        not determine the reason. </p>
      <p>In the early sixties, Louis Kervran's discoveries on
        transmutations were published by a French scientific review.
        Kervran demonstrated that not only molecules but also atoms
        could be transformed, and he verified the transmutation of
        matter from atom to atom. (4) </p>
      <p>[(4) Jueneman, F.B.: <i>Industrial Research</i> 19 (13): 11
        (Dec. 1977), "The Transmutation of Species".] </p>
      <p>Komaki reported that eight strains of microorganisms grown in
        K-deficient culture media increase the total K by converting Ca
        to K --- a fission reaction. A theoretical basis for Kervran's
        work has been discussed by de Beauregard. (5) </p>
      <p>[(5) de Beauregard, O. Costa: <i>Proc. 3rd Intl Cong. Psych.
          (Tokyo)</i>, p. 158 (June 1967)] </p>
      <p>Working at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, Baranger, who also
        headed the organic laboratory, determined that transmutations
        were indeed taking place. Yet, none of these latter-day
        alchemists could propose a theory for the mechanism of such an
        unlikely appearing event as biological transmutation. </p>
      <p>Summarizing, disclosures have been made of transmutation in
        microorganisms, plants, and animals. Some have been fusion while
        others have been fission phenomena. </p>
      <p><b>II.&nbsp;<a name="investig"></a>Investigation ~</b> </p>
      <p><b>(3) Plan ~</b> In the search for clues to the possibilities
        for energy development, calculations were made to determine
        whether there was a net weight loss during the transmutation.
        This was followed by an examination of the most likely place for
        the event to occur and the presence there of the same elements
        disclosed to have undergone nuclear changes. A study then flowed
        to determine of a mechanism was present which might cause such
        nuclear transmutations in accordance with presently accepted
        nuclear theory. </p>
      <p><b>(a) Net Weight Change ~</b> The study was limited to fusion
        reactions so that the difference in atomic number would be only
        one. These included Na, K, and Mn: </p>
      <p>Sodium to magnesium where: Na + H+ » Mg </p>
      <p>Potassium to calcium where: K + H » Ca </p>
      <p>Manganese to iron where: Mn + H » Fe </p>
      <p>The atomic weight differences were: </p>

        information has been discovered as to the energy required for
        these reactions to occur and, thus, whether there would be a net
        gain of energy. As far back as 1932, however, it was known that
        alpha particles having energies when ejected from radioactive
        elements of medium life of between 5 and 7 MeV could cause
        atomic disintegrations. Cockcroft and Walton built a tall,
        vertical tube capable of evacuation with a filament producing
        electrons at the top and a target of the element to be bombarded
        at the bottom. A low pressure of hydrogen was introduced and
        ionized by collisions with the electrons produced by the
        filament. The top of the tube could be raised to a high positive
        potential, up to 700,000 volts, the bottom being at earth. On
        reaching the bottom of the tube, the protons had a kinetic
        energy equal in electron-volts to the potential in volts at the
        top of the tube. Using a lithium target, at 45° angle to the
        bombarding protons, disintegrations of some of the lithium atoms
        into pairs of helium nuclei ejected almost in opposite
        directions were observed with only 120,000 volts. (6) </p>

        recognized as the primary site for energy production in all life
        organisms regardless of whether they are one-celled bacteria,
        plants, or animals (7). Some cells have as many as 7000
        mitochondria (Figure 1). The mitochondrion is divided into
        components in which various reactions take place (Figure 2). (8)

      <p><b>(d) Chemicals Involved ~</b> Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is
        now recognized as the molecule most involved in energy
        production in this mitochondrion (Figure 3). When complexed with
        Mg++, it forms a cyclic ATP and proceeds through a series of
        reactions which produces energy (Figure 4). </p>

      <p><b>(e) Energy Production ~</b> The Mg+ is considered to be a
        catalyst for these reactions. One phosphate group after another
        splits off so that the resultant chelate becomes a diphosphate
        (ADP) and then a monophosphate (AMP). The phosphate groups
        hydrolyze, and the energy of hydrolysis for each reaction is
        7500 calories. The D-ribose then splits off and proceeds through
        a long glycolic decomposition cycle to yield further energy. The
        chelated, cyclic MgATP thus breaks up completely and is rebuilt
        through a series of chemical reactions. None of the
        decomposition and rebuilding cycles is as yet completely
        understood. </p>
      <p><b>(f) Ions Present in the Mitochondrion ~</b> Na, Mg, K, Ca,
        Mn, and Fe ions have been found to be present in the
        mitochondrion. These are the same ions which have been
        previously found to undergo nuclear transmutations by Kervran.
        In addition, another pair, Cu and Zn, differing by one proton
        (elements numbered 29 and 30) is also present (9). H+ and OH-
        ions have been produced and are maintained in separate
        compartments (10). Conversion to Cu and Zn is also accompanied
        by a loss of mass and thus a production of energy: </p>

      <p><b>(g) Current Flow ~</b> The net result of the many reactions
        occurring in the mitochondrion is a flow of electrons (11). This
        flow is oscillatory in the MgATP crystal. </p>
      <p>[(11) Hinkle, Peter C. &amp; McCarty, Richard: <i>Scientific
          American</i> 104 (March 1978), "How Cells Make ATP".] </p>
      <p>Gurney determined that removing a negative ion from the
        interior of a perfect crystal left a vacant lattice point to
        which a positive charge is associated. If this point is
        approached by a free electron in the conduction band, the
        electron will be attracted as from a positive-charged particle.
        Thus, if the electron loses energy, it may be trapped in the
        field of the charge. This trapped electron will undergo a series
        of stationary states towards a series limit. Beyond this limit,
        a continuum of states will exist. The periodic field of the
        lattice will cause periodic fluctuations on the wave functions
        of the trapped electron, but the trapped electron will not be
        prevented from having a definite wave function, in each bound
        state, which will be like that of an electron within an atom in
        a vacuum and will be spread over many atomic distances in the
        crystal. (12) </p>
      <p>[(12) Gurney, R.W.: <i>Handbook of Physics</i>, ed. Condon
        &amp; Odishaw, 2nd edition, section 12 (1967), "Ionic
        Crystals".] </p>
      <p>Similarly, Gurney determined that removing a positive ion from
        within a perfect crystal left a vacant lattice point to which a
        negative charge is associated. If this point is approached by a
        free, positive hole in the filled electronic band, the free,
        positive hole will be attracted. If the free, positive hole
        loses energy, it will be trapped in the field of the negative
        charge. A set of stationary states toward a series limit will be
        encountered by the trapped, positive hole. (13) </p>

      <p><b>(h) Structure of MgATP ~</b>&nbsp; The complete
        conformational structure of mgATP has not yet been elucidated. A
        key problem has been the function of the Mg+. Kothekar, <i>et
          al</i>. (14), made a study of the changes in electronic charge
        and energy distribution in ATP and ADP after incorporation of
        Mg++. They hypothesized that even though Mg++ is not absolutely
        essential for enzymatic action, its presence facilitates the
        action by modifying the charge distribution. The most likely
        position of Mg++ is symmetrical between the three P atoms.
        Binding between Mg++ and ATP was considered mostly ionic in
        nature. No detailed, acceptable information is yet available
        regarding the crystalline structure of MgATP. (15) </p>

      <p><b>(4) Proposed Alternate Mechanism for Energy Production ~</b>&nbsp;
There








        is hardly a material in life organisms which performs which
        performs only a single function. Therefore, MgATP was examined
        for an additional and alternate means of energy production which
        would encompass nuclear fusion reactions in accordance with
        recognized nuclear theory and practice. The principal method of
        producing nuclear reactions is by an accelerator --- either
        linear or cyclic. E.O. Lawrence in the 1930s used the cyclotron
        resonance phenomenon as the basis for the cyclotron particle
        accelerator. He derived the equations of motion for a charged
        particle in a uniform, magnetic field with a constant period of
        revolution so that particles can be accelerated indefinitely in
        resonance with an oscillatory electric field. Recently, Hunter
        an McIver developed a small spectroscope based on this
        principle. (16) </p>
      <p>[(16) Hunter, Richard L. &amp; McIver, Robert T.: <i>American
          Laboratory</i> 9 (11): 13 (1978), "Rapid Scan ion Cyclotron
        Resonance Spectroscopy" ] </p>
      <p>In view of the lack of information regarding the crystalline
        structure of MgATP or its structure with regard to adjacent
        molecules of MgATP, it is hypothesized tat the molecules of
        MgATP are situated one above the other so located that the Mg++
        forms a continuous chain. With the exception of the D-ribose
        unit, the complex or chelate lies in a plane. The D-ribose folds
        up --- a phenomenon called sugar puckering (17). Since the
        D-ribose molecules might interfere with each other under these
        conditions, the MgATP has been rotated so that the D-ribose
        units would lie 180° apart. A top view of the two molecules is
        shown in Figure 5. Since the P groups are equidistant from the
        Mg++, it follows that they may be 60° apart around a circle
        whose center is the Mg++. The acyl oxygen dipoles attached to
        the P atoms would likewise be situated around the circumference
        in which case four molecules of MgATP would be required for
        twelve dipoles to be present in the circle (18). Figures 6 and 7
        show top and side views respectively of such an arrangement. The
        phosphate chain is in the folded configuration and not extended
        as in anhydrous, inorganic phosphates. It would form a helix,
        and torsion angles about the bonds have been calculated (19).
        The net effect would be that the H+ would make a helical path
        which would be circular as shown in Figure 7. </p>

      <p>Dipoles have been found to be energized by unsaturation in the
        ionic structure --- binding with metal ions with each dipole
        presumable requiring, on the average, one saturation or double
        bond (20). Hughes and Rideal showed that a dipole is induced in
        a double bond if it is situated in the alpha position but not if
        it is further away (21). In contrast, the presence of a double
        bond in the 4-5 carbon position of sphingomyelin increases the
        surface dipole and, hence, the surface potential of the
        monolayer (22). No evidence exists, therefore, for a
        maximum-distance limitation. In this case, the unsaturation in
        the adenine molecule comprising four double bonds should,
        therefore, be sufficient to energize the three dipoles in the
        phosphate groups. The current formed by the electron flowing in
        an oscillatory fashion from one Mg++ to another must of
        necessity be accompanied by an oscillatory magnetic field. This
        could easily extend out to the perimeter and accelerate the H+
        to relativistic speeds. It would be guided in its path by the
        dipoles. </p>

      <p>An interesting feature noticed in Figure 5 is the location of
        the adenine rings in the adenosine heterocycles. They sit
        directly on the circumference or perimeter of the circle formed
        by the acyl oxygen dipoles and 180° apart from each other. When
        a conjugated ring molecule is placed in a magnetic field, its
        electrons are caused to circulate and, in circulating, they
        generate secondary magnetic fields, i.e., induced only when
        exposed to a magnetic field (23). Because of the puckering
        effect of the D-ribose, the ring slopes and skews downward
        toward the perimeter. Its induced magnetic field, thus, has a
        tangential component capable of exerting an accelerating force
        on the H+ as it passes by. </p>

      <p>Each requirement for a cyclotron particle accelerator has been
        met on a molecular scale as follows: </p>
      <p><b>(a) Oscillatory Electric Field ~</b> There is a continuous
        flow of electrons in the mitochondrion. The current oscillates
        as it flows through the chain of Mg++. The electric field
        accompanying the current oscillates in unison with it. </p>
      <p><b>(b) Presence of Hydrogen Ions ~</b> Hydrogen ions are
        present in one of the compartments of the mitochondria. </p>
      <p><b>(c) Auxiliary Control &amp; Propulsion of H+ by Dipoles ~</b>
        An H+ introduced between the components of the sandwich would be
        attracted by an energized dipole and passed from one dipole to
        another around a helical circle having a diameter of
        approximately 30 Angstroms. </p>
      <p><b>(d) Induction of Ring Current in Adenine ~</b> The
        oscillating electric field induces an oscillating ring current
        in the adenine ring of the molecule. </p>
      <p><b>(e) Effect of Magnetic Field on Hydrogen Ion ~</b> As the H+
        passes under the ring, it is attracted by the magnetic field
        accompanying the ring current and accelerated to a very high
        speed. The H+ soon approaches relativistic speeds because the
        ring current also is probably rotating at such speeds. </p>
      <p><b>(f) Circular Helical Path of Hydrogen Ion ~</b> In a crystal
        having four molecules of MgATP, the path of the H+ is a circular
        helix. As many molecules of MgATP as are necessary would be
        present to accelerate the H+ and impart sufficient energy to it
        to penetrate the nucleus of an atom and convert it to an atom of
        the next higher number. </p>
      <p><b>III.&nbsp;<a name="discuss"></a>Discussion ~</b> </p>
      <p><b>(5) General ~</b> There were numerous evidences that the
        premise upon which the study was based was true, i.e., that
        nuclear transmutations were indeed taking place in life
        organisms of all types. It was shown that there was a net loss
        in mass for the transmutation of Na, Km and Mn to Mg, Ca, and Fe
        respectively. These represented energies in the range of 8.35
        MeV to 11.69 MeV. Although there was no information regarding
        the energy cost in effecting the transmutations, similar
        transmutations involving hydrogen ions were much less. Thus,
        there probably was a net gain in energy during the atomic
        transmutations. </p>
      <p>The mitochondrion, well known as the location for energy
        production in the cell, was closely examined for clues to the
        possibility of elemental transmutations also occurring there.
        The presence of the ion pairs (Na, Mg), (K, Ca), and (Mn, Fe) in
        the mitochondrion gave strong support top such a conjecture.
        Moreover, the additional pair (Cu, Zn) found there but not
        reported by Kervran or others provided added support. These were
        the only ions reported to have been found in the mitochondrion.
      </p>
      <p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in its chelated form with Mg as
        MgATP has been pinpointed as the source of energy in the
        mitochondrion. An examination of its structure indicated that
        when the molecules are placed one on top of another with the
        Mg++ in the center, the group resembles a working model of a
        cyclotron on a molecular scale. When MgATP is taken apart, its
        components can be burned to also form energy. An analogy would
        be a windmill or waterwheel made of wood. Both can harness the
        elements to produce mechanical or electrical energy. When they
        are taken apart and burned, the components produce thermal
        energy. </p>
      <p>The question of the primary purpose of the transmutations is of
        considerable interest. From Komaki's work, it would appear the
        transmutations were used to maintain a balance of certain
        elements in the human body. It is evident that health would be
        considerably impaired if it were attempted to obtain energy
        continuously from such transmutations. The body can tolerate
        just so much Na, K, Mg, Ca, etc., and the quantities are small.
      </p>
      <p>No reports have been found of experiments which were made in
        which energy was measured along with elemental transmutation.
        Such experiments would be relatively simple to design and
        perform. The relatively available huge supplies of the elements
        which have been reported to have been transmuted and the
        probable large accompanying energy surplus indicate a new source
        of energy in the offing --- one whose supply would be unlimited.
      </p>
      <p><b>IV.&nbsp;<a name="conclus"></a>Conclusions ~</b> </p>
      <p><b>(6) Conclusions ~</b> It is concluded that elemental
        transmutations occurring in life organisms are accompanied by
        losses in mass representing conversion to thermal energy and
        that such energy probably is a net gain when compared to the
        amount required to effect the transmutation. </p>
