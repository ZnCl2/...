      <p><b>Excerpted from Patrick J. Kelly : <i>The Practical Guide to
            free Energy Devices</i>&nbsp; <i>---</i></b> </p>
      <p>A patent application US 3,766,094 (shown in detail in an
        accompanying document) gives the details of an interesting
        device. While it is only an application and not a full patent,
        the information implies strongly that Michael built and tested
        many of these devices. </p>
      <p>While the power output is low, the design is of considerable
        interest. It is possible that the device works from picking up
        the output from many radio stations, although it does not have
        anything which is intended to be an aerial. It would be
        interesting to test the device, first, with a telescopic aerial
        added to it, and second, placed in an earthed metal box. </p>
      <p>The device is constructed by casting a small block of a mixture
        of semiconductor materials such as Selenium with, from 4.85% to
        5.5% Tellurium, from 3.95% to 4.2% Germanium, from 2.85% to 3.2%
        Neodymium, and from 2.0% to 2.5% Gallium. The resulting block is
        shaped with a dome on one face which is contacted by a short,
        pointed metal probe. When this arrangement is fed briefly with
        an oscillating signal, typically in the frequency range of 5.8
        to 18 Mhz, it becomes self-powered and can supply electric
        current to external equipment. The construction is as shown here
        : </p>
      <p>Presumably the output power would be increased by using
        full-wave rectification of the oscillations rather than the
        half-wave rectification shown. Michael says that increasing the
        dimensions of the unit increases the output power. The small
        unit shown in this example of his, has been shown to be able to
        provide flashing power for an incandescent lamp of up to 250 mA
        current requirement. While this is not a large power output, it
        is interesting that the output is obtained without any apparent
        input. Michael speculates that the very short connecting wires
        may act as radio reception aerials. If that is the case, then
        the output is impressive for such tiny aerials. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- A resonance oscillator electric power pack
        for operating a flash lamp, for example, or other electrically
        operated device, operates without moving mechanical parts or
        electrolytic action. The power pack is contained in a
        cylindrical metal envelope and in a preferred embodiment is
        coupled to a relaxation oscillator and an incandescent lamp.
        Within the envelope, and insulated therefrom, is a semiconductor
        tablet having a metal base connected to the external circuit. A
        metal probe makes contact with a point on the semiconductor
        tablet and also with a cylindrical ferrite rod axially aligned
        with the envelope. Wound about the ferrite rod are concentric
        helical coils designated as a primary with many turns and a
        secondary with fewer turns than the primary. The primary coil is
        connected at one end to the probe and at the other end to the
        secondary coil. The leads from the secondary coil are connected
        to the relazation oscillator by way of an adjustable capacitor.
        Oscillation within the envelope is resonance amplified, and the
        induced voltage in the secondary coil is rectified for
        application to the relaxation oscillator and lamp. Selenium and
        germanium base semiconductor compositions including Te, Nd, Rb
        and Ga in varying proportions are used for the tablet. </p>
      <p><b>Background</b> </p>
      <p>In many situations it is desirable to have a source of electric
        power that is not dependent on wires from a central generating
        station and, therefore, portable power supplies having no moving
        parts have been primary or secondary electrolytic cells which
        generate or store electrical energy for release by chemical
        action. Such batteries have a limited amount of contained energy
        and must often be replaced at frequent intervals to maintain
        equipment in operation. </p>
      <p>Thus, as one example, flashing lights are now commonly used
        along highways and other locations to warn of dangerous
        conditions. These flashing lights in remote locations are
        typically oncandescent or gas discharge lamps conected to some
        style of relaxation oscillator powered by a battery. The
        batteries have a limited lifetime and must be periodically
        replaced, typically each 250-300 hours of operation. This
        involves a rather large labor cost and additional cost for
        primary cells or for rechargin secondary cells. it is desirable
        to provide an electric power pack capable of providing a
        sufficient quantity of electrical energy over a prolonged period
        of time so that the requirement of periodic replacement of the
        electrolytic cells can be avoided. Such a power pack is valuable
        even if appreciably more expensive than batteries because of the
        greatly reduced labor for periodic replacement. </p>

      <b>Description</b>
      <p>Fig 1 illustrates schematically a typical flashing lamp having
        a power supply constructed according to principles of this
        invnetion. As illustrated in this presently preferred embodiment
        an electric power pack 5 is electrically connected to a
        relaxation oscillator circuit (shown only schematically) on a
        conventional printed circuit board 6. The power pack 5 and
        printed circuit board are mounted in a metal box 7 having a
        transverse partial partition 8 defining a space for the power
        pack and another space for the printed circuit board which is
        supported away from contact with the box by any convenient
        insulator. Preferably these elements are potted in palce in a
        conventional manner. A cover 9 having mounting ears 10 is
        riveted on the box after assembly. A small terminal strip 11 on
        one side of the box 7 provides eelctrical contacts for
        connection to a load such as an incandescent lamp (not shown in
        Fig. 1). The lamp provides a flash of light when the relaxation
        oscillator switches. Although the described system is employed
        for a flashing lamp, it will be apparent to one skilled in the
        art that this is only exemplary and other applications can be
        made. </p>
      <p>The electric power pack 10 is illustrated in longitudinal cross
        section in Fig 2 and has dimensions as set out here after. These
        dimensions are exemplary of the illustrated embodiment for
        operating a conventional flasher lamp, and it will be apparent
        that other dimensions may be employed for other applications. in
        particular, the dimensions may be enlarged in many circumstances
        in order to obtain somewhat high power levels and different
        voltage or current levels. The power pack comprises a
        cylindrical metal tube 16 having closely fitting metal caps 17
        at each end, which are preferably sealed to the tube after the
        internal elements are inserted in place. The metal tube 16 and
        caps 17, which are preferably of aluminum, thus form a closed
        conductive envelope which in a typical embodiment has an inside
        diameter of about 0.8 inch and a length of about 2-1/4 inch. </p>
      <p>Mounted within one end of the envelope is a plastic cup 18, the
        dimensions of which are not extremely critical; however, a wall
        thickness of at least 1/16 inch is preferred. Mounted within the
        plastic cup 18 is a semiconductor tablet 19 having a flat base
        and somewhat domed opposite side. The composition of the
        semiconductor tablet 19 is set out in greater detail
        hereinafter. Typically, the semiconductor tablet has a mass of
        about 3.8 grams. A metal disk 21 is positioned beneath the base
        of the ablet 19 in the cup 18, and is preferably adhesively
        bonded into the cup. The metal disk is tightly fitted to the
        base of the tablet so that good electrical contact is obtained
        over a subtatntial area of the semiconductor. An ear 22 on one
        edge of the disk is soldered to a lead wire 23 which extends
        through a short insulating sleeve 24 in a hole in the side of
        the metal envelope. The insulating sleeve 24 assure spacing of
        the lead wire 23 from the tube 16 and prevents accidental damage
        to the insulation in the lead wire which could lead to shorting
        to the metal case. Preferably, the insulating sleeve 24 is
        sealed with a small amount of plastic cement or the like in
        order to maintain clean air within the cylindrical envelope. Two
        other openings for leads through the tube 16, as hereinafter set
        forth, are also preferably sealed for maintaining cleanliness
        within the envelope. </p>
      <p>A pair of circular metal disks 26 are fitted within the tube 16
        and preferably cemented in place to prevent shifting. the two
        disks 26 are equally spaced from the oppsoite ends of the
        envelope and are spaced apart a little over 1.15 inch. each of
        the disks 26 includes a central aperture 27, and there are a
        plurality of holes 28 extending through the disk in a circular
        array midway between the center of the disk and its periphery.
        The holes 28 are preferably in the size range of about 0.010 to
        0.060 inch, and there are 12 on each disk on 30 degree centers
        around the circle. The two disks 26 thus divide the interior of
        the cylindrical envelope into three chambers, and the pattern of
        holes 28 provides communication between the chambers and affects
        the electrical properties of the cavity. It is believed that the
        pattern of holes affects the inductive coupling between the
        sevarl caviteis within the envelope for influencing oscillations
        therein. Although an arrangement of 12 holes on 30 degree
        centers has been found particularly advantageous in the
        illustrated embodiment, it is found in other arrangements that a
        pattern of 20 holes on 18 degree centers or a pattern of 8 holes
        on 45 degree centers, provides optimum operation. In either
        case, the circle of holes 28 is midway between the center and
        the periphery of the disk. </p>
      <p>Mounted between the disk 26 is a palstic spool 29 having an
        inside distance of 1.1 inch between the ends. the plastic spool
        29 is preferably relatively thin walled and has an internal bore
        diameter of 1/8 inch. A plastic mounting plug 31 is inserted
        through the central aperture 27 of one of the disks 26 remote
        from the semiconductor table 19, and into the bore of the spool
        29. The plastic plug 31 is preferably cemented in place to the
        disk 26 for holding the assembly together. </p>
      <p>Also mounted within the bore of the spool 29 is a cylindrical
        ferrite core 32 about 1/8 icnh diameter and 3/4 inch long.
        Although a core of any magnetic ferrite is preferred, other
        ferromagnetic materials having similar properties can be
        employed if desired. The core 32 is in electrical contact with a
        metal probe 33 about 1/4 inch long. Half of the length of the
        probe 33 is in the form of a cone ending in a point 34 in
        contact with the domed surface of the semiconductor tablet 19,
        thereby making electrical contact with the semiconductor in a
        relatively small point. </p>
      <p>Electrical contact is also made with the probe 33 by a lead 36
        that passes through one of the holes 28 in the disk 26 nearer
        the semiconductor tablet and thence to a primary coil 37 wound
        on the plastic spool 29. The primary coil 37 is in the form of
        800 to 1000 turns wound along the length of the spool, and the
        lead 28 at the opposite end of the coil 37 is soldered to one of
        the external leads 39 of the power pack. This lead 39 proceeds
        through one of the holes 28 in the disk remote from the
        semiconductor tablet 19 and through an insulated sleeve 41 in
        the metal tube 16. The lead 39 is also connected to one end of a
        secondary coil 42 which is in the form of 8 to 10 turns around
        the center portion of the primary coil 37. A thin insulating
        sheet 43 is preferably provided between the primary and
        secondary coils. The other lead 44 from the&nbsp; secondary coil
        passes through one of the holes 28 in the disk nearer the
        semiconductor tablet and thence through an insulating sleeve 46
        through the wall of the tube 16. </p>
      <p>Fig 3 illustrates schematically the electrical circuit
        employing an electric power pack constructed according to the
        principles of this invention. At the left-hand side of Fig 3 the
        arrangement of eleements is illustrated in a combination of
        electrical schematic and mechanical positions within the tube 16
        for ready correlation with the embodiment illustrated in Fig 2.
        Thus, the semiconductor tablet 19, probe 33, and ferrite core 32
        are shown in both their mechanical and electrical arragnement,
        the core being inductively coupled to the coils 37 and 42. The
        lead 23 from the metal base of the semiconductor tablet 19 is
        connected to a variable capacitor 47, the other side of which is
        connected to the lead 44 from the secondary coil 42. The lead 44
        is also connected to a rectifying diode 48 shunted by a high
        resistance resitor 49. </p>
      <p>It will be seen that the variable capacitor 47 is in a tank
        circuit with the inductive coils 37 and 42 which are coupled by
        the ferrite core 32, and this circuit also includes the
        semiconductor tablet 19 to which point contact is made by the
        probe 33. The mechanical and electrical arrangment of these
        elements provides a resonant cavity in which resonance occurs
        when the capacitor 47 is properly trimmed. The diode 48
        rectifies the oscilaltions in this circuit to provide a suitable
        DC for operating an incandescent lamp 50 or similar load. </p>
      <p>The rectifying diode 48 is connected to a complementary
        symmetry relaxation circuit for switching power to the load 50.
        The diode is connected directly to the collector of a PNP
        transistor 51 which is in an inverted connection. The emitter of
        the PNP transitor is connected to one side of the load by way of
        a timing resistor 55. The base of the transistor 51 is connected
        by way of a resistor 52 and a capacitor 56 to the collector of
        an NPN transitor 53, the emitter of which is connected to the
        other side of the load 50. The base of the NPN transitor 53 is
        coupled to the diode by a resistor 545. The emitter of the PNP
        transistor 51 is fed back to the base of the NPN transistor 53
        by the resistor 55. Current flow through the lamp 50 is also
        limited by a resistor 57 which couples one side thereof and the
        emitter of the NPN transistor 53 to the two coils 37 and 42 by
        way of a common lead 39. </p>
      <p>The electrical power pack is believed to operate due to a
        resonance amplification once an oscillation has been initiated
        in the cavity, particularly the central caivity between the
        disks 26. This oscillation, which apparently rapidly reaches
        amplitudes sufficient for useful power, is then half wave
        rectified by the diode 48 for use. With such an arrangement, a
        voltage level of several volts has been obtained, and power
        sufficient for intermittent operation of a lamp requiring about
        170-250 milliwatt has been demonstrated. the resonant
        amplification is apparently due to the geometrical and
        electrical combination of the elements, which provide inductive
        coupling of components in a suitable resonant circuit. This
        amplification is also, at least in part, due to unique
        semiconductor properties in the tablet 19, which has electronic
        properties due to a composition giving a unique atomic
        arrangement, the exact nature of which has not been measured. </p>
      <p>The semiconductor tablet has electronic properties which are
        determined by the composition and three such semiconductors
        satisfactory for use in the combination have been identified. In
        two of these, the base semiconductor material is selenium
        provided with suitable dopant elements, and in the third, the
        base element is germanium, also suitably doped. The
        semiconductor tablets are made by melting and casting in an
        arrangement that gives a large crystal structure. It has not
        been found necessary to provide a selected crystal orientation
        in order to obtain the desired effects. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;A preferred composition of the semiconductor includes
        about 5% by weight of tellurium, about 4% by weight of
        germanium, about 3% by weight of neodymium, and about 4.7% by
        weight of rubidium, with the balance of the composition being
        selenium. Such a composition can be made by melting these
        materials together or dissolving the materials in molten
        selenium. </p>
      <p>Another highly advantageous composition has about 5% by weight
        of tellurium, about 4% by weight of neodymium, and about 2.24%
        by weight of gallium. In order to make this composition, it is
        found desirable to add the very low melting gallium in the form
        of gallium selenide rather than an elemental gallium. </p>
      <p>A third suitable composition has about 5% by weight of
        tellurium, about 4% by weight of neodymium, about 6% by weight
        of rubidium, with the balance being germanium. The preferred
        compositions set forth hereabove are not absolute and it has
        been found that the level of dopant in the compositions can be
        varied within limits wiothout significant loss of performance.
        Thus, it is found that the proportion of tellurium in the
        preferred composition can range from about 4.8% to about 5.5% by
        weight, the germanium can range from about 3.9% to 4.5%;
        neodymium can range from about 2.9% to 3.5% by weight; and
        rubidium can vary from about 4.5 to 5.0% by weight. The balance
        of the preferred composition is selenium, although it has also
        been found that nominal impurity levels can be tolerated and no
        great care is required in preventing minor contamination. </p>
      <p>The other selenium base composition useful in practice of this
        invention can have a tellurium concentration in the range of
        from about 4.85 to 5.5% by weight; neodymium in the range of
        about 2.85 to 3.2% by weight; and gallium in the range of from
        about 2.0 to 2.5% by weight. As in the preferred composition,
        the balance is selenium and nominal impurity levels can be
        tolerated.. It is preferred to add the gallium in the form of
        gallium selenide with a corresponding decrease in the selenium
        used to make up the composition. </p>
      <p>The above selenium base compositions are easier to make and
        less expensive than the germanium base composition and are
        therefore preferable for most applications. It is found that
        these are particularly suited for relatively small semiconductor
        tablets up to about 1 inch or less. For relatively large
        tablets, it is preferred to use the germanium base composition.
      </p>
      <p>The germanium base composition has a tellurium level in the
        range of from about 4.75 to 5.5% by weight; neodymium in the
        range of from about 4.0 to 4.5% by weight; and rubidium in the
        range of from about 5.5% to 7.4% by weight. It is also found
        that it of greater importance to maintain purity of the
        germanium base compositions than the selenium base compositions.
        Although the exact purity levels have not been ascertained, it
        is in excess of 99%. </p>
      <p>It has been found that it is not necessary to have single
        crystals in the semiconductor tablets and any convenient grain
        size in excess of about 1 mm appears satisfactory. In the above
        compositions, when the recited ranges are exceeded, oscilaltion
        in the power pack drops off rapidly and may cease altogether. </p>
      <p>The reasons that these compositions are satisfactory in the
        arrangemnt providing resonance amplification has not been
        determined with certainty. it is possible that the semiconductor
        serves as a source of electrons for providing an oscillating
        current in the circuit. This is, of course, combined with a
        relatively large area contact on another area. Any resonant
        current in the coils wound on ferrite rod induces a varying
        magnetic field in the resonant cavity, and the electrical
        connection between the ferrite rod and the metal probe provides
        a feedback of this oscilation to the semiconductor tablet. </p>
      <p>It should particularly be noted that the oscilation in the
        circuit does not commence until it is initiated by an
        oscillating signal. In order to accomplish this, it is only
        necessary to apply a few millivolts AC for a few seconds to the
        semiconductor tablet and the associated coils coupled thereto.
        The initial signal applied to the base of the semiconductor
        tablet and the lead 39 is preferably in the frequency of 5.8 to
        18 MHz, and can be as high as 150 MHz. Such a signal can be
        applied from any conventional source and no great care&nbsp;
        appears necessary to provide a single frequency signal or
        eliminate noise. Once such energization has been given the
        circuit, and oscillations initiated, it does not appear to again
        be necesary to apply such a signal.This is apparently due to the
        feedback provided by the ferrite rod to the probe making point
        contact with the semiconductor. </p>
      <p>Energy is, of course, dissipated in the lamp, or other
        utilization device, as the combination operates. Such energy may
        come from the deterioration of the semiconductor tablet as
        oscilaltions continue; however, if there is such deterioration
        it is sufficienyly slow that a power source may be operated for
        many months without attendance. Such a source of energy may be
        augmented by ambient RF radiation coupled into the resonant
        cavity by the external leads. This is a surprising phenomenon
        because the leads are small as compared to what would normally
        be considered an adequate antenna, and it is therefore
        postulated that stimulated amplification may also be a
        consequence of the unique electronic configuration of the
        semiconductors having the above-identified compositions. </p>
      <p>Although only one embodiment of electric power pack constructed
        according to the principles of this invnetion has been described
        and illsutrated herein, many modifications and variation will be
        apparent to one skilled in the art. Thus, for example, a larger
        power pack may be axially arranged in a cylindrical container
        with various electronic elements arranged in the annular space
        therebetween. it is, therefore, to be understood that within the
        scope of the appended claims the invnetion may be practiced
        otherwise than as specifically described... </p>
