      The Forest Products Laboratory of the US Forest Service has opened
      a US$1.7 million pilot plant for the production of cellulose
      nanocrystals (CNC) from wood by-products materials such as wood
      chips and sawdust. Prepared properly, CNCs are stronger and
      stiffer than Kevlar or carbon fibers, so that putting CNC into
      composite materials results in high strength, low weight products.
      In addition, the cost of CNCs is less than ten percent of the cost
      of Kevlar fiber or carbon fiber. These qualities have attracted
      the interest of the military for use in lightweight armor and
      ballistic glass (CNCs are transparent), as well as companies in
      the automotive, aerospace, electronics, consumer products, and
      medical industries.<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Cellulose is the most abundant biological polymer on the planet
      and it is found in the cell walls of plant and bacterial cells.
      Composed of long chains of glucose molecules, cellulose fibers are
      arranged in an intricate web that provides both structure and
      support for plant cells. The primary commercial source for
      cellulose is wood, which is essentially a network of cellulose
      fibers held together by a matrix of lignin, another natural
      polymer which is easily degraded and removed.<br>
      <br>
      Wood pulp is produced in a variety of processes, all of which
      break down and wash away the lignin, leaving behind a suspension
      of cellulose fibers in water. A typical cellulose wood fiber is
      only tens of microns wide and about a millimeter long.<br>
      <br>
      The cellulose in wood pulp, when dry, has the consistency of fluff
      or lint - a layer of wood pulp cellulose has mechanical properties
      reminiscent of a wet paper towel. Not what you might expect to be
      the source of one of the strongest materials known to Man. After
      all, paper is made from the cellulose in wood pulp, and doesn't
      show extraordinary strength or stiffness.<br>
      <br>
      Further processing breaks the cellulose fibers down into
      nanofibrils, which are about a thousand times smaller than the
      fibers. In the nanofibrils, cellulose takes the form of
      three-dimensional stacks of unbranched, long strands of glucose
      molecules, which are held together by hydrogen bonding. While not
      being "real" chemical bonds, hydrogen bonds between cellulose
      molecules are rather strong, adding to the strength and stiffness
      of cellulose nanocrystals.<br>
      <br>
      The upper figure shows the structure of the cellulose polymer; the
      middle figure shows a nanofibril containing both crystalline and
      amorphous cellulose; the lower figure shows the cellulose
      nanocrystals after the amorphous cellulose is removed by acid
      hydrolysis<br>
      <br>
      Within these nanofibrils are regions which are very well ordered,
      in which cellulose chains are closely packed in parallel with one
      another. Typically, several of these crystalline regions appear
      along a single nanofibril, and are separated by amorphous regions
      which do not exhibit a large degree of order. Individual cellulose
      nanocrystals are then produced by dissolving the amorphous regions
      using a strong acid.<br>
      <br>
      At present the yield for separating CNCs from wood pulp is about
      30 percent. There are prospects for minor improvements, but the
      limiting factor is the ratio of crystalline to amorphous cellulose
      in the source material. A near-term goal for the cost of CNCs is
      $10 per kilogram, but large-scale production should reduce that
      figure to one or two dollars a kilo.<br>

      CNCs separated from wood pulp are typically a fraction of a micron
      long and have a square cross-section a few nanometers on a side.
      Their bulk density is low at 1.6 g/cc, but they exhibit incredible
      strength. An elastic modulus of nearly 150 GPa, and a tensile
      strength of nearly 10 GPa. Here's how its strength to compares to
      some better-known materials:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Material...........................Elastic
      Modulus................Tensile Strength<br>
      &nbsp;CNC......................................150
      GPa........................7.5 GPa<br>
      &nbsp;Kevlar 49...............................125
      GPa........................3.5 GPa<br>
      &nbsp;Carbon fiber...........................150
      GPa.........................3.5 GPa<br>
      &nbsp;Carbon nanotubes..................300
      GPa.........................20 GPa<br>
      &nbsp;Stainless steel.........................200
      GPa.........................0.5 GPa<br>
      &nbsp;Oak.......................................10
      GPa...........................0.1 GPa<br>
      <br>
      The only reinforcing material that is stronger than cellulose
      nanocrystals is a carbon nanotube, which costs about 100 times as
      much. Stainless steel is included solely as a comparison to
      conventional materials. The relatively very low strength and
      modulus of oak points out how much the structure of a composite
      material can degrade the mechanical properties of reinforcing
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      As with most things, cellulose nanocrystals are not a perfect
      material. Their greatest nemesis is water. Cellulose is not
      soluble in water, nor does it depolymerize. The ether bonds
      between the glucose units of the cellulose molecule are not easily
      broken apart, requiring strong acids to enable cleavage reactions.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen bonds between the cellulose molecules are also too
      strong in aggregate to be broken by encroaching water molecules.
      Indeed, crystalline cellulose requires treatment by water at 320°
      C and 250 atmospheres of pressure before enough water intercalates
      between the cellulose molecules to cause them to become amorphous
      in structure. The cellulose is still not soluble, just disordered
      from their near-perfect stacking in the crystalline structure.<br>
      <br>
      But cellulose contains hydroxyl (OH) groups which protrude
      laterally along the cellulose molecule. These can form hydrogen
      bonds with water molecules, resulting in cellulose being
      hydrophilic (a drop of water will tend to spread across the
      cellulose surface). Given enough water, cellulose will become
      engorged with water, swelling to nearly double its dry volume.<br>
      <br>
      Swelling introduces a large number of nano-defects in the
      cellulose structure. Although there is little swelling of a single
      CNC, water can penetrate into amorphous cellulose with ease,
      pushing apart the individual cellulose molecules in those regions.
      In addition, the bonds and interfaces between neighboring CNC will
      be disrupted, thereby significantly reducing the strength of any
      material reinforced with CNCs. To make matters worse, water can
      move easily over the surface/interfaces of the CNCs, thereby
      allowing water to penetrate far into a composite containing CNCs.<br>
      <br>
      There are several approaches to make CNC composite materials
      viable choices for real world applications. The simplest, but most
      limited, is to choose applications in which the composite will not
      be exposed to water. Another is to alter the surface chemistry of
      the cellulose so that it becomes hydrophobic, or water-repelling.
      This is easy enough to do, but will likely substantially degrade
      the mechanical properties of the altered CNCs. A third approach is
      to choose a matrix material which is hydrophobic, and preferably
      that forms a hydrophobic interface with CNCs. While not
      particularly difficult from a purely chemical viewpoint, there is
      the practical difficulty that interfaces between hydrophobic and
      hydrophilic materials are usually severely lacking in strength.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps the most practical approach will simply be to paint or
      otherwise coat CNC composite materials in some material that keeps
      water away. For such a prize - inexpensive strong and rigid
      materials - we can be sure that innovations will follow to make
      the theoretical practical.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention relates to a process for producing cellulose
      nanocrystals from renewable biomass, and to cellulose nanocrystals
      with carboxylic groups produced by the process. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Described in 1838 by French scientist Anselme Payen, cellulose has
      the molecular formula ([Omicron]6[Eta]10[Omicron]5)[eta]. It is
      the most abundant organic polymer, being used in an amount of
      about 1.5 * 10&lt;12&gt; tons per year. It has been used as a
      renewable, biodegradable and environmentally benign chemical raw
      material for 150 years. Cellulose is semicrystalline, having both
      crystalline and amorphous regions. It is densely packed with
      strong inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds conferring
      excellent mechanical properties.<br>
      <br>
      Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as a new class of
      nanomaterials for polymer reinforcement and nanocomposite
      formulation owing to their exceptionally high mechanical strength
      (modulus of 145 GPa; Marks, 1967), tensile strength of 7.5 GPa
      (Sturcova, 2005), chemical tunability, and anticipated low cost.
      CNCs have also been fostered for diversified applications
      including enzyme immobilization (Mahmoud et al., 2009), drug
      delivery, and biomedical applications (Dong and Roman, 2007).<br>
      <br>
      In order to produce CNCs, fiber sources from various vegetative
      wastes with high initial cellulose contents are being considered
      as potential starting materials due to their low costs. The
      amorphous regions of the cellulose fibers must be chemically
      removed to yield highly crystalline CNCs. Popular acid hydrolysis
      using a single concentrated acid or an acid mixture, often with
      the aid of an oxidant, is capable of dissolving the amorphous
      regions (Revol et al., 1992), leaving behind CNCs with crystalline
      rod-like fibers. Such procedures, however, are expensive,
      requiring considerably high initial capital investment and having
      high operating costs due to the corrosiveness, safety issues and
      hazardous waste treatment/disposal requirements of such acids and
      their by-products. Additional pre- and/or post-treatment steps
      with alkaline or bleaching reagents are required to remove
      non-cellulosic fiber contents (e.g. lignin, pectin,
      hemicelluloses, etc).<br>
      <br>
      Bai et al. (2009) describe a method for the production of CNCs
      with narrow distribution from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). A
      conventional sulfuric acid procedure was used to produce CNCs
      (Dong et al., 1998). This process is known to produce a wide range
      of size distribution. In order to obtain a narrow size
      distribution of CNCs, differential centrifugation with at least
      six cycles was required. Even so, the CNCs still exhibited at
      least four different aspect ratios. US 2008/0108772 (Oksman et
      al., 2008) describes a process for producing cellulose nano
      whiskers by treating MCC with HCI, as well as a new extrusion
      method to produce a reinforced organic polymeric material. The
      production of cellulose nano whiskers using HCI hydrolysis
      required pure cellulosic materials (e.g. MCC) and the resulting
      cellulose nano whiskers had a large size distribution. Fractions
      of cellulose crystals with larger size were isolated by
      centrifugation at low speed and discarded. The cellulose nano
      whiskers produced had a large size distribution of 100 nm to 1000
      nm in length and 5 nm to 15 nm in width.<br>
      <br>
      Persulfates, for example ammonium persulfate, are well known
      strong oxidants. In the prior art, for example as described in US
      5,004,523 (Springer and Minor, 1991 ), ammonium persulfate has
      been used for the isolation of lignin from lignocellulosic
      materials. Usually a mixture of ammonium persulfate together with
      either strong acid (50% HCI or H2S04) or strong base (KOH or NaOH)
      is required. The product isolated from this process is bleached
      cellulose, not CNCs.<br>
      <br>
      There remains a need for a simple, cost-effective process for
      producing CNCs, especially from vegetative biomass.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It has now been surprisingly found that an inorganic persulfate is
      able to produce clean cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) from
      vegetative biomass in one step by dissolving lignin,
      hemicellulose, pectin, and other plant contents. In one aspect of
      the present invention, there is provided a process for producing
      cellulose nanocrystals comprising: providing a cellulosic
      material; contacting the cellulosic material with an inorganic
      persulfate at an elevated temperature to produce cellulose
      nanocrystals; and, recovering the cellulose nanocrystals.<br>
      <br>
      The inorganic persulfate preferably comprises ammonium persulfate
      ((NH4)2S208), sodium persulfate (Na2S208), potassium persulfate
      (K2S2Os) or a mixture thereof. More preferably, the inorganic
      persulfate comprises ammonium persulfate, (NH4)2S208.<br>
      <br>
      Any suitable source of cellulosic materials may be used, for
      example, vegetative or non-vegetative biomasses. Non-vegetative
      biomasses include cellulosic materials that have undergone
      considerable pre-treatments, for example, cellulose from papers
      and microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). It is an advantage of the
      present process that CNCs may be produced in one step from
      vegetative biomass. Thus, the cellulosic material preferably
      comprises vegetative biomass, more preferably raw vegetative
      biomass. Any suitable vegetative biomass may be used, for example,
      one or more of hemp material (e.g. raw hemp, pectate-lyase treated
      hemp), flax material (e.g. raw flax, pectate-lyase treated flax),
      triticale material, wood sources (e.g. wood pulp, cardboard) and
      agricultural residues. More preferably, the cellulosic material
      comprises one or more of hemp or flax material.<br>
      <br>
      The process is conducted at an elevated temperature. Preferably,
      the elevated temperature is in a range of from about 45[deg.]C to
      about 80[deg.]C, for example about 60[deg.]C. The persulfate is
      preferably provided in an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution
      preferably has a concentration of persulfate in a range of from
      about 0.5 M to about 2.0 M, more preferably in a range of from
      about 0.5 M to about 1.0 M, for example about 1.0 M. Preferably,
      the persulfate is stirred with the cellulosic material.
      Preferably, contacting the cellulosic material with persulfate is
      performed for a period of time in a range of from about 5 hours to
      about 24 hours, for example about 16 hours.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
      cellulose-based material comprising nanocrystals of cellulose, the
      nanocrystals having surface carboxylic acid groups.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a
      cellulose-based material comprising nanocrystals of cellulose, the
      nanocrystals having an average diameter of less than about 7 nm
      with substantially all of the nanocrystals having diameters within
      about 0.5 nm of the average diameter and an aspect ratio (L/D) of
      10 or greater. The average diameter is preferably less than about
      5 nm. In one embodiment, the average diameter is in a range of
      from about 3 nm to about 7 nm, preferably in a range of from about
      3 nm to about 4.9 nm. The aspect ratio is preferably in a range of
      from about 12 to about 60. Preferably, substantially all of the
      nanocrystals have diameters within about 0.3 nm of the average
      diameter. CNCs of the present invention preferably have a
      crystallinity index (CRI) that is 5% or more greater than the CRI
      of the cellulosic material from which the CNCs are made.
      Advantageously, the CRI may be 7% or more greater than, or even
      10% or more greater than, the CRI of the cellulosic material from
      which the CNCs are made. The CRI may be, for example, up to 20%
      greater, or up to 17% greater, than the CRI of the cellulosic
      material from which the CNCs are made. The values of 5% or more,
      7% or more or 10% or more may be lower limits of a range in which
      the upper limit is 20% or 17%. Preferably, the surface carboxylic
      acid groups are formed by selective oxidation of C6 primary
      hydroxyl groups of the CNCs. Preferably, the degree of oxidation
      is in a range of from about 0.01 to about 0.20, more preferably in
      a range of from about 0.08 to about 0.19, or in a range of from
      about 0.05 to about 0.10, for example about 0.08.<br>
      <br>
      The present process is advantageously a one-step process for
      producing CNCs from vegetative biomass that has significant
      benefits in terms of scalability, safety, sustainability and
      low-cost. The present approach may be considered as a chemical
      nanoscissor and is effective in processing raw cellulosics,
      especially flax and hemp, which contain hemicellulose, lignin and
      pectin; in contrast to prior art acid hydrolysis processes which
      require pre-purification (e.g. steam exploding) and
      post-purification (e.g. bleaching) steps to produce good quality
      CNCs. For example, the present process is useful for processing
      high-lignin cellulosic materials (e.g. 20% or more lignins), which
      obviates the need for steam exploding the cellulosic material
      while still resulting in good quality CNCs. The stability and
      economic viability of persulfate renders it a suitable replacement
      for acids as strong oxidants.<br>
      <br>
      The present facile process provides a commercially viable method
      of obtaining CNCs with enhanced uniformity and crystallinity and
      with smaller diameter and larger aspect ratio than conventional
      processes. The present process directly results in uniform CNCs
      with a narrow size distribution, as opposed to conventional
      processes as disclosed in Dong et al., 1998, Bai et al., 2009 or
      Oksman et al., 2008 for example, which require tedious
      post-separation techniques to improve uniformity and which still
      do not result in uniformity as good as in the present invention.
      Thus, the present process produces high yields of CNCs with narrow
      size distribution without requiring tedious separation steps such
      as differential centrifugation. Further, CNCs produced in the
      present process are surface carboxylated with 8% or higher
      functionality, which makes them more reactive and improves their
      flexibility and processability in composites. In contrast, acid
      hydrolysis produces CNCs having only hydroxyl groups (when HCI is
      used) or having only up to 2% sulfonyl groups (when H2S04 is
      used).<br>
      <br>
      CNCs have a wide range of applications, including use as
      nanofillers in the polymer industry and use as high strength
      nanopaper in personal body armor.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Materials:</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Ammonium persulfate, potassium persulfate, and sodium persulfate
      were obtained from Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Avicel PH102
      microcrystalline cellulose was obtained from FMC Corp
      (Philadelphia, PA, USA). Whatman CFI cellulose powder was
      purchased from Whatman Inc. (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Flax (Linum
      usitatissimum) and flax shives from Saskatchewan, Canada and hemp
      (Cannabis sativa) from Quebec, Canada. Triticale straw extract was
      obtained from Dr. G. (Joe) Mazza, Agriculture and Agri-Food
      Canada, Summerland, BC, Canada. This freeze dried extract
      comprises 54.5% cellulose, 12% hemicelluloses and 20% lignin.
      Bacterial cellulose was obtained from Dr. W.K. Wan, University of
      Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada. This bacterial cellulose is
      produced by the gram-negative bacteria Acetobacter xylinum
      BPR2001. The bacterial cellulose is produced in the form of fibers
      of diameter less than 50 nm and a degree of polymerization of
      between 2000 and 6000. Detailed information about the production,
      purification, and characteristics of the bacterial cellulose are
      known in the art.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1: Preparation of
        cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) by persulfate</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The process described in this example is an environmentally
      friendly, one-step procedure for the preparation of CNCs from
      different cellulosics. Ammonium persulfate has a very high
      solubility in cold water (85 g/100 ml_), while the sodium (55.6
      g/100 ml.) and potassium (5.3 g/100 ml.) counterparts (Weast,
      1983) have lower solubility. CNCs were prepared by simply heating
      cellulosic materials at 60[deg.]C in 1 M persulfate for 16 h with
      vigorous stirring, as described in more detail below using
      ammonium persulfate as an example. Lignocellulosic fibers such as
      flax and hemp were cut into short fragments (about 2-3 mm) prior
      to the persulfate treatment. Prolonged reaction time and
      persulfate concentrations above 1 M led to excessive hydrolysis,
      thereby reducing the yield of CNCs.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, in one example, starting biomass material (0.1 g) was added
      to 10 mL of 1 M ammonium persulfate solution (conductivity about
      230 mS-cm&lt;"1&gt;). The suspension was heated to 60[deg.]C for
      16 h (only 3 h for bacterial cellulose) to give a white suspension
      of CNCs. The suspension was centrifuged (18,000 rpm, RCF = 25,400)
      for 10 min. The solution was decanted, and about 50 mL of water
      was added to the CNC pellet, followed by 5 min of vigorous mixing
      and repeated centrifugation. The centrifugation/washing cycles
      were repeated 4 times until the conductivity of the solution was
      about 5 pS-cm&lt;"1&gt; (pH about 6), close to the conductivity of
      deionized water. The product was lyophilized to yield a white
      solid. Example 2: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission
      electron microscopy (TEM)<br>
      <br>
      CNCs prepared using ammonium persulfate were sonicated and atomic
      force microscopy (AFM) micrographs of such resulting CNCs were
      obtained using a Nanoscope(TM) IV (Digital Instruments, Veeco,
      Santa Barbara, CA) with a silicon tip operated in tapping mode.
      Particle analysis of the AFM micrographs was performed using
      Scion(TM) Image
      (http://www.scioncorp.com/pages/scion_image_windows.htm).<br>
      <br>
      TEM micrographs were obtained by a Hitachi transmission electron
      microscope (TEM) at 60 kV (model H-7500, Tokyo, Japan). TEMs were
      obtained as follows. A small amount of CNCs was suspended in
      methanol and sonicated to disperse the material. A 20 [mu][Iota]_
      drop of well dispersed suspension was then dried on a Formvar-
      carbon coated grid and analyzed. Low Voltage Transmission Electron
      Microscopy (LVTEM) micrographs were obtained by a Delong LVEM
      (Soquelec Ltd., Montreal, QC, Canada) low-voltage TEM at 5 kV,
      with lower accelerating voltages generating higher contrast
      between the carbon mesh and CNCs.<br>
      <br>
      AFM (Fig. 1A and Fig. 1 B) and TEM micrographs confirmed the
      rod-shape geometry of the CNCs. Such rod-shapes were highly
      uniform compared to those obtained by prior art acid treatment.
      For flax (Fig. 1A), the diameter of the CNCs was 3.8 +- 0.1 nm
      while the length was 144 +- 5 nm. For comparison, prior art acid
      hydrolysis of flax gave CNCs with a diameter of 21 +- 7 nm and a
      length of 327 +- 108 nm (Cao et al., 2007). For hemp (Fig. 1 B),
      the diameter of CNCs was 5.8 +- 0.1 nm, while the length was 148
      +- 3 nm. For comparison, prior art acid hydrolysis of hemp gave
      CNCs with a diameter of 30 +- 0 nm and a length that was
      micrometers in size (Cao et al., 2008).<br>
      <br>
      Nanocrystal size, shape, and size distribution were dependent to a
      certain extent upon the starting cellulosic material. As an
      example, the cross-section dimension of CNCs prepared from hemp
      and flax centered on about 2-6 nm, reflecting elementary fibrils
      (about 3-7 nm in diameter) initially present in the starting
      materials. Such CNCs are much more uniform and significantly
      smaller than CNCs obtained by prior art acid hydrolysis (diameters
      ranging from 10-20 nm; Mahmoud et al., 2009). Tables 1 and 2
      provide yield, crystallinity index (CRI) and dimensions of CNCs
      prepared from various sources using ammonium persulfate. CRIs are
      estimated using the integral method and from peak heights (in
      parentheses). Length and diameter are reported at 95% confidence
      interval. Table 1<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 2</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Other CNC samples prepared from different cellulosics also showed
      a similar mean particle length and length polydispersity. In
      comparison, CNCs produced from flax and hemp using prior art acid
      hydrolysis procedures have higher average diameters of 16-28 nm
      and 20-40 nm, respectively. Further, the average length of CNCs
      prepared in accordance with the present invention was about 90- 50
      nm such that the average aspect ratio of the CNCs was determined
      to be 30 compared to 10 for CNCs obtained by acid hydrolysis.
      These are very important findings since the uniformity, small
      size, and high aspect ratio of cellulose nanocrystals are critical
      for their intended applications as nanofillers. Considering the
      dimension of one unit cell (7.8 A, 8.2 A, and 10.4 A), or one
      glucose unit of the cellulose chain is equal to about 0.5 nm, the
      degree of polymerization of CNCs was estimated to be 20 to 500
      using a known method in the art (Nishiyama et al., 2002).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 3: Scanning electron
        microscopy (SEM)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      SEM analysis was performed on a Hitachi S 2600N scanning electron
      microscope at 2.8 kV. SEM revealed morphological changes on the
      surface of the fibers upon ammonium persulfate treatment,
      indicating the destruction of the amorphous regions. In contrast,
      the fiber remained intact when subjected to heating without
      ammonium persulfate. Ammonium persulfate was able to in situ
      produce clean CNCs by dissolving lignin, hemicellulose, pectin,
      and other plant contents. Free radicals are formed when the
      solution containing persulfate is heated (S208&lt;2~&gt; +
      heat-&gt; 2S04 &lt;"&gt;) (Hsu et al., 2002). Therefore,
      persulfates are often used as initiators for emulsion
      polymerization reactions in the preparation of polymers and
      synthetic rubber. In addition, under the acidic condition used in
      this study (pH 1.0), hydrogen peroxide was formed (S208&lt;2"&gt;
      + 2H20 -&gt; HS04&lt;"&gt; + H202) (Edgar and Gray, 2003;
      Stiernstedt et al., 2006). Collectively, such free radicals and
      H202 should be capable of penetrating the amorphous regions to
      break down the [beta]-1 ,4 linkage of the cellulose chain to form
      CNCs. Both free radicals 2S0 &lt;~&gt; and H202 also opened the
      aromatic rings of lignin to decolorize this material. Prior art
      acid hydrolysis procedures require alkaline or bleaching agents to
      remove the other fiber contents and this treatment often affects
      the crystallinity and structure of cellulose (conversion of
      cellulose I to cellulose II; Krassig, 1996).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 4: X-ray diffraction
        (XRD) analysis Wide angle X-ray scattering analyses were
        obtained at room temperature on a</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Panalytical X'pert PrO diffractometer equipped with a copper
      (CuKa, A = 1.54184 A) rotating anode source, along with
      instrumental settings of 45 kV and 40 mA. Samples were carefully
      deposited on glass slides and inserted in the chamber. The
      collected data were analyzed using WinPLOTR
      (hllp:llwww.llb.cea.fr/fullweb/winplotrlwinplotr.htm), a graphic
      tool for powder diffraction to provide peak position (2[Theta]),
      FWHM (full width half maximum), peak deconvolution, and
      integration intensity for calculation of the crystallinity index
      (CRI). The dhki-spacing is calculated as //2sin0 with A = 1.54184
      A. The crystal size is estimated as KA/FWHM.cosd with the form
      factor or Scherrer constant ( ) taken as 1 (Scherrer, 1918). CNCs
      prepared from various biomass sources were characterized by X-ray
      diffraction (XRD). Results are provided in Fig. 2 and in Tables 3
      and 4. Fig. 2 shows PXRD spectra of CNCs produced from hemp before
      and after treatment with 1 M ammonium persulfate. The inset shows
      the deconvoluted cellulose peaks. Table 3 provides a comparison of
      crystallite size, dhki-spacing and crystallinity index (CRI)
      before and after treatment of biomass samples. Table 4 provides a
      comparison of the peak position (2[Theta]) values for the most
      intense peaks before and after treatment of biomass.<br>
      <br>
      The CNC diffractograms exhibited the most intense peak (002) with
      a shoulder (021 ) and two lower peaks ( 01 and 10-1 ). In some
      samples, a very small peak (040) at 35[deg.] was observed. In all
      cases, the (002) peak position remained virtually unchanged during
      the course of treatment. Such features, including the d-spacing
      and average crystallite size as determined by the Debye-Scherrer
      formula (Debye, 1915) resembled the diffraction pattern of
      cellulose I and confirmed the integrity of the material during the
      course of treatment with ammonium persulfate. The crystallinity
      index (CRI) of CNCs was then estimated using an integral method
      based on the ratio of the areas of crystallines to total scattered
      intensity (Jayme and Knolle, 1964) with the results summarized in
      Table 1 . CRI estimated using the maximum intensity (peak height)
      from (002) plane and the intensity of the background scatter
      measured at 2[Theta] of about 18[deg.] often results in
      overestimated crystallinity (Segal et al., 1959; Thygesen et al. ,
      2005). CNCs prepared in this work can be used to cast smooth thin
      films, which are suitable for surface force and friction
      measurements (Stienstedt et al., 2006).<br>
      <br>
      In general, CRIs of CNCs were noticeably higher than that of their
      parental counterparts except for CNCs prepared from MCC and
      Whatman CFI. FWHM (full width half maximum) of the 002 peak was
      also smaller than that of the starting material, indicative of
      less dissolution of CNCs. For flax shives and hemp, the initial
      CRI was about 50-70%, in agreement with the literature data
      (Bhatnagar and Sain, 2005). With very high initial crystallinity,
      the treatment of MCC and Whatman CFI with ammonium persulfate just
      resulted in shorter fibers whereas the CRI remained unchanged.

      <br>
      Sodium and potassium persulfate were also capable of producing
      CNCs. Similarly to ammonium persulfate treatment, CRIs of the CNCs
      produced with sodium and potassium persulfate increased by about
      8-16% from their starting materials. The dimensions of the CNCs
      obtained from sodium and potassium persulfate are summarized in
      Table 5. CRIs are estimated using the integral method and from
      peak heights (in parentheses). Length and diameter are reported at

      <br>
      XPS analysis was performed using an AXIS(TM) ULTRA spectrometer
      (Kratos Analytical Ltd., Manchester, UK) equipped with a
      monochromatic Al Ka source at a power of 225 W. The elemental
      composition of the analyzed surface areas was obtained from survey
      spectra collected at pass energy of 160 eV. High-resolution C (1
      s) and O (1 s) spectra were collected at 20 eV. The pressure in
      the analytical chamber was lower than 10&lt;"6&gt; Pa and the
      apparatus was calibrated against the following lines: Au (4f), Ag
      (3d) and Cu (2p). Since the sample was charging, an electron flood
      gun was used during the XPS experiments. Atomic concentrations of
      each element were calculated using CasaXPS (Casa Software Ltd.) by
      determining the relevant integral peak areas, and applying the
      sensitivity factors supplied by the instrument manufacturer; a
      Shirley background was used. To compare the high-resolution C (1
      s) and O (1 s) peak positions, the spectra were shifted to ensure
      that the leading edges of the fitted aliphatic CH* component were
      coincident and the detail spectra were fitted with several peaks
      using a mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian function. The XPS spectrum of
      CNCs from flax prepared by ammonium persulfate treatment is shown
      in Fig. 3. The sample shows the main segments for C (1 s) and O (
      s) due to CNCs and only insignificant traces of N (1 s), S (2p)
      and Si (2p).<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 7: Infrared spectroscopy
        (IR) </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were collected from 4000
      to 400 cm&lt;"1&gt; for 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm&lt;"1&gt;
      using a Bruker Tensor 27 FTIR spectrophotometer. Samples were run
      as KBr pellets. Near infrared (NIR) analysis for cellulose content
      was measured with an Antaris FT-NIR analyzer equipped with an
      integrating sphere. An internal gold flag was used as the
      instrument background, the spectral resolution was set to 8
      cm&lt;"1&gt; and 300 scans were processed mathematically to
      generate one spectrum. The spectra for each sample were processed
      with the 2nd derivative transformation to remove the spectral
      baseline drift due to the color and scattered light from the
      particles. The PLS (Partial Least Square) algorithm was used to
      develop the correlation models for the cellulose (%), lignin (%),
      and hemicelluioses (%) concentration measurements (i.e.
      calibration curves) (Guhados et al., 2005).<br>
      <br>
      CNCs prepared from various biomass sources were characterized by
      FTIR spectroscopy. Fig. 4 lists the FTIR absorption bands and
      their assignments for the various cellulosic materials and their
      corresponding CNCs. The increase of CRI of various cellulose
      materials after their treatment with persulfate also correlated
      well with FTIR data. FTIR spectra of the CNCs showed absorption
      bands that are typical for cellulosic materials. The presence of
      signals at 1429 cm&lt;"1&gt; , 1 163 cm&lt;"1&gt;, 1 1 1 1
      cm&lt;"1&gt; and 897 cm&lt;"1&gt; indicated that the CNCs are
      primarily in the form of cellulose \[beta], except for
      persulfate-treated bacterial cellulose in which characteristic
      absorption bands at 3241 cm&lt;"1&gt; and 753 cm&lt;"1&gt;
      confirms the high degree of cellulose type l0 in bacterial
      cellulose. Persulfate treatment of bacterial cellulose resulted in
      the reduction of the mass fraction of cellulose l0 to l^. The
      absorption patterns of the CNCs remained unchanged after treatment
      with persulfate, indicating that there are no significant changes
      to the conformation of the cellulose structure, i.e. mercerization
      did not occur. The ratios between crystalline absorption at 1430
      cm&lt;"1&gt; and amorphous absorption at 895 cm&lt;"1&gt; of CNCs
      was higher than that of its parental counterpart (Nelson and
      O'Connor, 1964). Although this FTIR ratio has been used to
      calculate CRI, its applicability is somewhat limited, e.g., not
      applicable for mercerized cellulose (cellulose II) and provides
      rather poor correlations with the PXRD data. The IR spectra of
      CNCs prepared from various materials displayed a peak at 1735
      cm&lt;"1&gt; , which was absent from CNCs obtained by acid
      hydrolysis. This peak could be attributed to oxidation of the C6
      primary hydroxyl groups on the cellulose fibers to form carboxylic
      acids. The degree of oxidation (DS) of the CNCs was determined
      using a conductometric titration method to be about 0.08 (da Silva
      Perez et al., 2003). Conductometric titration experiments on
      different samples showed that the degree of oxidation can be in a
      range of from about 0.08 to 0.19. The increase of CRI of flax and
      hemp after their treatment with ammonium persulfate also
      correlated well with an increase in cellulose content as observed
      by NIR analysis (Kramer and Ebel, 2000; Poke and Raymond, 2006).
      Cellulose content for flax fibers increased from 70% to 79% after
      persulfate treatment, whereas the cellulose content for hemp
      increased from 75% to 83%. CNCs with higher cellulose content may
      be prepared using fibers treated with pectate lyase, with
      cellulose content of 84% and 93% for flax and hemp, respectively.
      The observed increase in cellulose content illustrated that the
      present process is effective in the removal of non-cellulosic
      content from the natural fibers.<br>
