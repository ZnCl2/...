          <p><b>SUN’S RAYS ARE HARNESSED IN SOLAR FURNACE</b> </p>
          <p><img src="solfurn1.jpg" height="591" width="458"></p>
        </center>
        <p>ARCHIMEDES, famous mathematician, is said to have set fire to
          the fleet of the Roman emperor, Marcellus, by the use of a
          series of concave mirrors concentrating the sun’s rays upon
          the fleet. John Ericsson, the designer of the Monitor, of
          civil war fame, constructed several engines having boilers
          provided with mechanical devices for effecting the necessary
          concentration of solar rays which, when collected from 100
          square feet of surface, effected the evaporation of 489 cubic
          inches of water per hour, more than equivalent to one
          horsepower. This is, however, but a small proportion of the
          potential energy actually developed by solar heat hourly
          received upon an area of this size. Ericsson estimated it to
          be equivalent to that caused by the combustion of 200 tons of
          coal in the same time. To harness this energy, a solar
          furnace, with which it is claimed it is possible to attain
          much higher temperatures than that given by the electric
          furnace, has been built. The apparatus is composed of about
          twenty-five lenses and mirrors, the mirrors forming the walls
          of a cone and the lenses arranged to form a dome near the base
          of the cone. By adjustments the sun’s rays are concentrated
          within an area of about one-quarter of an inch, which is the
          working part of the furnace. It is claimed that by simply
          increasing the number of lenses and mirrors increased
          temperatures may be attained. In tests made with this furnace,
          the more common metals immediately melted and passed off in
          gaseous form. Even substances like graphite are unable to
          withstand the intense heat. The working part of the furnace
          is, of course, extremely small and can handle samples of not
          over two grams in weight. One of the advantages claimed for
          this . apparatus is that substances can be melted or
          evaporated in a vacuum, as they may be inclosed in a glass
          vessel. It is believed that a furnace of this sort can reach
          temperatures sufficiently high to melt substances that up to
          the present have been considered infusible. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A solar furnace heating system is
          disclosed which is characterized by the provision of novel
          rotary vane-type heat collector elements arranged in a heat
          collecting chamber beneath the generally vertical transparent
          wall of a housing. The fluid to be heated is conveyed across
          the heat collecting chamber in heat-transfer relationship with
          the rotary heat collector elements, and then to a heat storage
          chamber contained in the bottom portion of the housing. After
          the temperature of the fluid in the heat storage chamber
          reaches a given value, heated fluid from the heat storage
          chamber may be conveyed, upon demand, to the enclosure to be
          heated. In one embodiment, the heat collector elements are
          mounted for free rotation in the housing by the fluid that is
          conveyed through the heat collecting chamber. In a second
          embodiment, means are provided for rotatably driving the heat
          collector elements in synchronism. </p>

          energy from a battery of remote, positionable mirrors with the
          furnace having primary and secondary reflectors directing
          concentrated radiant energy toward a Fresnel lens. The focal
          point of the lens is located within a furnace chamber into
          which is advanced a carbon conduit, the advancing end of which
          is vaporized by focal point temperatures. The vaporized carbon
          serves as a catalyst for the production of hydrogen. The
          furnace chamber is in upstream communication with means for
          separating hydrogen and carbon dioxide. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A solar furnace of dish-shaped
          configuration for the reflection of solar rays toward a heat
          exchanger through which passes a heated medium. The reflective
          surface of the furnace comprises a multitude of mirror
          elements incorporated into a fiber glass reinforced plastic
          structure with each of the mirror elements located so as to
          reflect rays toward a common focus. A wire grid spaces each of
          the mirror elements during furnace construction. Each of said
          mirror elements is temporarily supported on a loosely woven
          fiber glass cloth permitting each element to individually
          adapt to the curvature of a convex mold. Subsequent
          application of fiber glass and resin to the thickness desired
          results in a rigid dish-shaped structure within which may
          incorporate support components. A method of furnace
          construction is additionally set forth. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A solar furnace wherein multiple Fresnel
          lenses focus light rays upon heat conductors associated with
          each of the lenses. Each heat conductor has an exposed arcuate
          portion which serves to mount lens supporting means permitting
          pivotal movement of said supporting means about the conductor
          to maintain the lens focus in common with a portion of the
          conductor. Fluid passing through the vessels is heated to the
          extent that same may be used for powering a steam turbine
          associated with an electrical generator. To provide a
          self-contained, transportable generating system the solar
          furnace may be incorporated into a structure mounting
          additional components providing for condensation of the steam
          and recirculation to the solar furnace vessels. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- The invention comprises a single unit
          which serves as the solar collector, heat storage area, and
          the heat exchanger. A generally rectangular tank is provided
          with suitably heavy insulated walls at the bottom, ends and
          rear. One side, facing the sun is open and the opening extends
          into a portion of the top. The top is provided with a thickly
          insulated cover. The open side is provided with a corrugated
          surface, the preferred angle being the latitude plus 10 DEG .
          The water is carried through suitable tubing which enters the
          tank through one end wall. The tubing is reentrantly bent in
          the tank to provide a plurality of lengths (4 shown) and then
          out through the same end wall but below the entrance. The tank
          is then filled with a suitable material having good heat
          storage and heat exchange properties. The best material is an
          eutectic salt having extremely high heat absorption and
          storage ability in direct contact with the container wall,
          which is designed to absorb heat radiation, and in direct
          contact with the tubing to transfer the heat to the water
          passing through. Other substances, such as concrete, can also
          be used. The corrugated side is covered with an insulating
          glass or transparent plastic twin-walled sheet mounted at the
          front. The unit is attached to the water supply through the
          tubing extending at one side, the conventional water supply
          pressure being sufficient to operate the unit. The unit is
          placed on the ground adjacent the building. The unit is
          modular and the effects can be increased by adding units in
          line and hooking them up in series or parallel as desired. The
          system lends itself to the use of much smaller units hooked
          together in banks for easier handling. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- This disclosure generally relates to a
          technique and apparatus for solar heating which may be adapted
          for heating residential, commercial or industrial buildings,
          and in which the functions of solar energy collection, storage
          and heat-exchange are combined in the same passive structure
          generally consisting of a plurality of cylindrical tubes
          preferably fabricated of glass-fiber reinforced polyester
          resin which are filled with a stationary heat absorbing
          medium, such as water, with their surfaces preferably coated
          with a high absorptance material on to which solar rays are
          directed through a solar "transmittor" or window, and which
          surfaces serve as heat-exchange elements from which heat may
          be extracted in a variety of ways, including passage of air
          and thermal siphoning, and with the tubes enclosed within an
          appropriate insulated chamber. Cooperative action with
          domestic or similar hot water systems may also be achieved. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- An energy storage and conversion system
          utilizes unique heat exchange media for storing and
          transferring heat. In one embodiment, a refractory material is
          heated to the molten state by a solar furnace. The refractory
          material is stored in its molten form and metered to a
          direct-contact heat exchanger. It is fed into the heat
          exchanger in a plurality of streams that break into a
          plurality of droplets. The droplets flow through the heat
          exchanger in countercurrent relationship with a relatively
          inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. The gas is heated and
          expanded through an expansion engine to convert the thermal
          energy to mechanical energy which in turn can be utilized to
          produce electricity, for example. The refractory can be
          sufficiently cooled in the heat exchanger to fuse into beads,
          which can be easily recycled to the solar furnace. </p>

          where it recombines into SO3 and gives off heat. The SO3 is
          directed back to the solar furnace and repeats the cycle.
          Useful heat is taken from the salt-heat chamber for operation
          of an electrical generator or other desired equipment. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A wind powered device incorporates a
          solar furnace and vortex generator to provide additional power
          and boost the efficiency of the complete system. Two
          concentric dome assemblies connected by a centrally located
          shaft are connected to a base with bearings capable of
          rotating the whole assembly 360 DEG about a vertical axis to
          allow it to turn into the wind. The two domes form a furnace,
          an inner dome providing insulation for a solar boiler and an
          exterior dome refracting the incoming sunlight onto the solar
          boiler. The solar boiler is located at the center of the inner
          dome and generates steam to drive fans positioned at the poles
          of the outer dome. The outer dome also functions as a wind
          powered rotor. Inlet vanes at the periphery of the dome are
          open to the atmosphere. The exterior of the dome is provided
          with trapezoidal or curved channels at regular distances
          parallel to the path of rotation. These channels effect lift
          by the venturi effect. They also channel the light to the
          center of the dome. Fans on the shaft evacuate air from the
          inside of the dome through openings located at the poles of
          the outer dome. As air is pulled through the outer dome and
          through the inlet vanes the outer dome will rotate. The system
          operates simultaneously as a solar furnace, a wind powered
          generator and as a vortex generator. </p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">The answer to Australia's clean energy
                needs could be in Canberra</font></b> </p>
          <p>By Claire Gorman </p>
          <p><img src="ausolconc.jpg" height="380" width="285"></p>
        </center>
        <p>The answer to Australia’s' clean energy needs maybe right
          here in Canberra. The Australian National University is home
          to an invention that could meet 100 per cent of Australia's
          energy needs. </p>
        <p>666 ABC Canberra's environment reporter, Claire Gorman, met
          up with Keith and he showed her the spectacular big dish. The
          400-square metre dish is the world's largest solar
          concentrator, which shifts with the sun to feed electricity
          back into the grid. </p>
        <p>"If we covered an area a couple of times as big as the ACT
          with dishes like this, reasonably spaced out, we could provide
          100 per cent of Australia's energy needs," Keith said. </p>
        <p>One "big dish" provided enough power for about 100 houses, he
          said. Currently the ANU is working on an improved prototype
          which the university hopes will be finished early next year. </p>
        <p>Keith explained that the dish followed the sun during the
          day. The mirrors on its surface gather up the radiation and
          focus it to a receiver 13 metres above. The receiver is made
          from tubing with water going through it. The water boils and
          creates super-heated steam with temperatures of up to 500
          degrees Celsius. </p>
        <p>"In the same way that in a coal-fired power station we might
          burn coal to make steam...ultimately we are going to use this
          steam for power generation without greenhouse gas emissions,"
          Keith said. </p>
        <p>Keith said one of the issues in the current debate about
          clean energy revolved around the potential collapse of coal
          industry. "What do we do for export income?" he asked. </p>
        <p>One scenario, he suggested, was a transition to clean energy
          by using solar power for gasification of - or adding energy to
          - coal to create methanol. </p>
        <p>Methanol is a petrol substitute and if it is created in this
          way, it is 30 per cent solar-generated and could create export
          income, he said. </p>
        <p>"We're not going to beat the current price of coal-fired
          electricity I don't believe. But I think we will beat some of
          the other options, like nuclear power." he said. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A lightweight solar concentrator of the
          reflecting parabolic or trough type is realized via a thin
          reflecting film, an inflatable structural housing and
          tensioned fibers. The reflector element itself is a thin,
          flexible, specularly-reflecting sheet or film. The film is
          maintained in the parabolic trough shape by means of a
          plurality of identical tensioned fibers arranged to be
          parallel to the longitudinal axis of the parabola. Fiber ends
          are terminated in two identical spaced anchorplates, each
          containing a plurality of holes which lie on the desired
          parabolic contour. In a preferred embodiment, these fibers are
          arrayed in pairs with one fiber contacting the front side of
          the reflecting film and the other contacting the back side of
          the reflecting film. The reflective surface is thereby
          slidably captured between arrays of fibers which control the
          shape and position of the reflective film. Gas pressure in the
          inflatable housing generates fiber tension to achieve a truer
          parabolic shape. </p>

          The latter works on a shuttle action principle which is
          effected by providing a hydraulic link between each pair of
          cylinder blocks. The hydraulic link in all the cylinder pairs
          is effected by connecting each pair of cylinders by means of
          two parallel tube connectors. Each of these connectors is
          provided with two valves, whereby one of the valves is
          controlled by the camshaft rocker, while the other (the
          so-called "normally-open" valve) is closed only by the
          pressure of steam from the inside of its cylinder. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A method and system is described for
          controlling a solar collector. A microprocessor receives
          inputs from one or more sensors in the system and determines
          the level of operation of an energy conversion device. If the
          level of operation reaches a predetermined setpoint below a
          maximum level at which the device is to operate, a variable
          focus solar concentrator is defocused to reduce energy input
          into the energy conversion device. When the system cools down
          and operates at a second predetermined level, lower than the
          first predetermined level, the concentrator is then refocused
          to increase the power input to the energy conversion device. </p>

          the first laser at approximately one focal length behind the
          focal point of the concentrator is illuminated by the beam
          after reflection thereof off of the selected facet. A second
          laser, located adjacent to the vertex of the optical axis of
          the concentrator, is used to direct a second laser beam onto
          the target board at a target point thereon. By adjusting the
          selected facet to cause the first beam to illuminate the
          target point on the target board produced by the second beam,
          the selected facet can be brought into alignment with the
          target point. These steps are repeated for other selected
          facets of the concentrator, as necessary, to provide overall
          alignment of the concentrator. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A solar concentrator is provided that
          comprises two stages. The first stage comprises either a
          trough-shaped concentrator cusp unit having two major opposed
          sides joined by two ends. The inner surfaces of the first
          stage concentrator are mirrored. Further, the ends have two
          flat, angled surfaces, while the two sides have a
          Bezier-generated cylindrical shape that approximate parabolic
          surfaces followed by a straight section. The second stage
          comprises a bi-axial gradient refractive index (GRIN) element,
          in which two gradient refractive index materials, each having
          a high index surface and a low index surface, are joined
          together along their high index surfaces. The two ends of the
          bi-axial element are flat, while the two sides also have a
          Bezier-generated cylindrical shape that approximate parabolic
          surfaces followed by a straight section. The top surface of
          the bi-axial element is provided with a cylindrical surface,
          while the bottom, or exit, surface is ground flat. The high
          index boundary is parallel to the side surfaces of the first
          stage unit. A solar cell is bonded to the flat exit surface of
          the second stage of the concentrator of the present invention.
          An array of such concentrators and solar cells, in which the
          solar cells are electrically interconnected, may then be
          deployed for converting solar energy into useful electrical
          energy. The 2-D/3-D concentrator evidences much lower mass
          than prior art concentrators. Further, as the array, or panel,
          of solar cells wobbles in space, the concentrator will
          continue to operate, even at lower efficiencies, due to the
          larger acceptance angle. Concentration ratios on the order of
          50x are realized with the present concentrator. However,
          design studies allow concentration ratios in excess of 300x
          when used with 3-D versions of the same concept. The second
          stage can comprise mirrored surfaces. Or, the first stage can
          comprise a conical section and the second stage a radial GRIN
          element. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A solar thermal rocket that includes a
          thermal energy storage section, a radiant inter-heater, a
          primary solar concentrator, and a propulsion nozzle. The
          primary solar concentrator is selectively movable to direct
          solar energy to either the thermal energy storage section or
          to the radiant inter-heater. The thermal energy storage
          section, along with insulation, is arranged to define a cavity
          such that a focused beam of solar rays can enter the cavity
          through an aperture in the insulation. The thermal energy
          storage section typically absorbs and stores solar energy
          during the non-propulsion portion of the orbital period. The
          solar rays are captured and absorbed and thereby heat the
          thermal energy storage section to very high temperatures. A
          radiant inter-heater directly receives concentrated solar rays
          and transfers the heat to the propellant during the propulsion
          phase. The propellant heated by the inter-heater is directed
          through the thermal energy storage section where it is further
          heated to its peak temperature and then expelled through the
          nozzle to produce thrust. With the inter-heater, the rate of
          heat extraction from the thermal energy storage section is
          reduced, prolonging the period of peak propellant temperature,
          resulting in an overall higher average specific impulse. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A novel, high-efficiency, extremely

          deploy the concentrator on orbit. The back surface supports
          the energy receiver/converter located in the focal region of

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A steam boiler (14) is situated on a
          tower (16) at the center of concentric tracks (17), (18), and
          (19). Poles (21) and (23) have wheels (25) running on the
          tracks. The poles are kept upright on the tracks with guylines
          (35) and struts (31) and (33). The poles carry frameworks (24)
          with mirrors (12) attached to them. As the earth turns, the
          poles move along the tracks, keeping the mirrors on the
          opposite side of the boiler from the sun and keeping sunlight
          focused approximately on the boiler. As the poles move, the
          frameworks pivot to fine tune the focusing. Each framework
          pivots about a horizontal axle (26) of the framework and about
          the vertical axis of one of the poles (21). Hydraulic
          cylinders (66) and (70) in series circuits (82) and (78)
          respectively pivot the frameworks collectively. The frameworks
          are arranged so the power needed to pivot the frameworks is
          the same on windy days and calm days. At night and when storms
          approach, the poles move to closely-spaced tracks (20) where
          the frameworks form a protective shell (38), (40), (41) and
          (42) around the mirrors. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract </b>--- A solar to mechanical or electric power
          conversion system which has a controller that varies the speed
          of a cooling fan and cooling fluid pump fan in accordance with
          the available solar energy intensity, ambient temperature
          surrounding the system and other operating conditions. The
          system includes a suitable heat source such as an isotope heat
          source, fuel combustor, or a solar concentrator that delivers
          solar energy to a focal point by reflection from mirrors or by
          Fresnel lens. A suitable solar concentrator may also be based
          upon on densifying the solar photon count by a Winston
          concentrator. For solar heated devices based on concentrated
          solar energy, a receiver is located at the focal point. This
          receiver is heated by concentrated solar energy. Heat is
          transferred to a working fluid which powers a heat engine. The
          heat engine converts the thermal energy into mechanical
          energy. The mechanical energy is transmitted to a load coupled
          to the engine. The temperature of the working fluid is lowered
          by transfer to the surroundings by operation of means selected
          from the group including a cooling fluid valve means, variable
          rate fan, a variable rate pump, a cooling fluid to air heat
          exchanger, a cooling fluid to ground heat exchanger, and a
          change of phase heat exchanger. The speed of the fan and pump
          are controlled by a controller which also senses the ambient
          temperatures that are available and the temperature of the
          cooling fluid. The controller computes an optimum cooling
          fluid temperature as a function of energy expenditure and
          controls fan, valve, and pump operations to achieve the
          desired energy conversion optimization. </p>

          for the solar cell elements. The mirror surface is provided

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- Mixtures of reactant gases containing
          nitrogen are reacted by being raised to very high temperatures
          at the focal plane of a solar concentrator when radiant energy
          is absorbed by a metal screen or other porous material in
          contact with the reactants at the focal plane of a solar
          concentrator and the resulting products of combined nitrogen
          are rapidly cooled in a unique heat transfer unit which
          rapidly transfers the heat of the product gases to the
          reactant gases and the rapid cooling of the product fixes the
          high temperature equilibrium proportions to achieve larger
          proportions of product than would be possible by gradual
          cooling. The heat that is transferred from the product gases
          to a set of clusters of metal tubes during one period of a
          cycle is transferred from the tubes to reactant gases during a
          second period of the cycle by a reversal of gas flow direction
          through the tubes and through the screen, the reversal also
          causing a second set of tubes, which was cooled by the
          transmission of reactant gases to the screen in the first
          period, to absorb heat from the products during the second
          period with the effect that repeated reversal of gas flow
          direction provides a two part cycle in which one, then the
          other, set of tubes first absorbs product heat and later gives
          up the heat to preheat incoming reactant gases. The coaxial
          placement of the various sets of heat transfer tubes with
          their openings confronting and immediately adjacent to the
          screening the focal plane provides for very rapid cooling and
          removal of the product before it can undergo any gradual
          cooling. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A trough-type reflecting solar
          concentrator and receiver system for aerospace use is
          disclosed. The reflecting surface is a thin flexible sheet
          attached to and disposed between curved ribs. The amount of
          the sheet reflecting sunlight can be changed by winding the
          unnecessary quantity of sheet onto a roll. The focal length of
          the curved ribs and therefore the sheet can be changed by
          flexurally deforming the curved ribs by applying end loads,
          causing a change in the flux density at the receiver. A
          similar result is achieved by changing the distance between
          the reflecting surface and the receiver. The receiver is a
          photovoltaic array, thermal absorber, or a combination of
          both. Means for proportioning the amount of energy incident on
          each type of receiver is disclosed. A spectral splitting
          thermal absorber with scattering capability is disclosed as a
          pre-filter for the photovoltaic array. </p>

          an appropriate angle toward a path of solar traverse so as to
          function for any desired fraction of the year without

          reservoir. Higher temperature performance is achieved in part
          by making minimal adjustments to the angle of lean. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract --- </b>A structure and method for providing a
          broken symmetry reflector structure for a solar concentrator
          device. The component of the optical direction vector along
          the symmetry axis is conserved for all rays propagated through
          a translationally symmetric optical device. This quantity,
          referred to as the translational skew invariant, is conserved
          in rotationally symmetric optical systems. Performance limits
          for translationally symmetric nonimaging optical devices are
          derived from the distributions of the translational skew
          invariant for the optical source and for the target to which
          flux is to be transferred. A numerically optimized
          non-tracking solar concentrator utilizing symmetry-breaking

          directs sunlight into a container lined with solar cells and

          with respect to certain wavelengths of light that may be
          converted to electricity by the solar cell, but is opaque with
          respect to longer wavelengths, particular the infrared band.
          The infrared portion of the sunlight heats the thermal
          transfer fluid, which then transfer that heat through a
          storage facility using a heat exchange mechanism. The thermal
          transfer fluid increases the efficiency of photovoltaic
          generation by preventing heating of the solar cells due to

          one-dimensional beam deflector consists of a pair of prism
          arrays made from a material whose refractive index can be
          varied by applying an electric field. Two of the

          distribution of an applied field modifies the refractive index
          of the individual prisms in order to keep direction of the
          deflected beam fixed as the incident beam shifts. When the
          beam deflector is used with the fixed concentrator the result
          is that the position of the focus remains fixed as the source

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- This patent describes a method for power
          generation combining a solar concentrator and a pneumatic
          power tube system. Solar energy is concentrated to solar
          thermal receivers by a plurality of heliostat mirrors placed
          along the embankment of an open pit mine. The air in the
          pneumatic tubes is heated by direct and/or waste heat energy
          recovered from a solar power system and/or from a variety of
          sources. The invention is novel in its integration of a solar
          powered heat engine and a modular design, pneumatic power tube
          wherein a means of structural support for the tube(s) can be
          provided by the geophysical surroundings. The novel design
          features of the power tube pit include: its use of
          state-of-the art wind turbine power recovery, solar reflective
          surfaces for solar energy collection, heat pipe arrays for
          ground source heat recovery and air diffuser subsystems for
          enhanced wind turbine efficiency. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- The efficient operation of a solar
          concentrator requires the radiation collector to be pointed
          directly at the sun. The present invention represents one
          approach to a passive solar tracking system capable of
          focusing solar radiation onto a small target at all times of
          the year. The device consists of a two-axis gimbal system with
          its orientation controlled by interconnected ballasts filled
          with a volatile fluid. Accurate focusing is realized by
          ensuring that each significant mass element is balanced by
          another element of equal mass equidistant from and
          diametrically opposite to it through the point of intersection
          of the two gimbal axes for all possible orientations of the
          system. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- The sealed enclosure for an electrical
          power generation solar concentrator holds and protects the
          photovoltaic cell from ambient conditions and thermal shock,
          while multiple fingers of front and rear electrical contact
          terminals accommodate thermal expansion and contraction of the
          cell and minimize mechanical stresses on the cell. This sealed
          enclosure also holds the secondary lens and protects the
          internally reflective truncated conical rear surface of the
          lens. A base member has a socket for receiving the cell and
          its associated front and rear terminal members together with
          an insulator alignment disc having an opening receiving the
          cell and for aligning the cell with the axis of the
          concentrator. A front housing removably screws onto the base
          member with an inturned front lip gripping a peripheral flange
          on the secondary lens, thereby aligning it with the cell and
          firmly pressing it against the cell front for causing thermal
          mass and inertial of the lens to moderate temperature changes
          in the cell. The base member screws onto a pedestal of a
          finned heat sink of good thermal conductivity fitting into a
          pre-punched hole in a panel of the concentrator, thus aligning
          the sealed enclosure with the concentrator axis. The pressure
          of the secondary lens on the cell causes the cell back to
          press onto its multiple-fingered rear contact member of good
          electrical and thermal conductivity which in turn is pressing
          against a thin electrical insulator in good thermal

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A splined radial panel solar collector
          structure approximates compound curvature surfaces by a
          three-dimensional arrangement of compactly stowable flat
          reflective panel segments mounted on a collapsible,
          space-deployable support structure of linear components. The
          support framework is formed of an umbrella-like framework of
          radially-extending ribs, struts and cords which deploy away
          from a central hub to form a system of radial trusses. A
          semirigid reflective surface structure is divided into
          sections of radial panels which are supported and shaped by an
          arrangement of radially tensioned flexible tape members
          aligned with the ribs. Connecting ties between the tapes and
          the ribs cause the tapes to assume a catenary curve. The ribs
          and flexible tape members are bridged circumferentially by
          sets of cords and ties to which the panels are joined. These
          cord and tie pairs place the panels in bending to effect a
          "splined" approximation of a parabola in the radial direction.
          The panels are arranged in a side-by-side relationship so as
          to be foldable in the circumferential direction during
          stowage. The panels are also discontinuous in the radial
          direction along lines connecting adjacent rib hinges in order
          to allow the reflective surface to be folded at the hinge
          points during stowage. As a result, each gore is effectively
          subdivided into a number of radial sections determined by the
          number of hinges along each rib and associated tape member.
          Openings are provided between the ends and sides of the panel
          strips so as to permit relative movement during folding and
          deployment, and to allow the panels to expand and contract
          with temperature change. </p>

          a (parabolic) surface of revolution rotated about a prescribed
          focal axis. Each panel section is comprised of a plurality of
          reflector facets whose reflective surfaces effectively focus
          reflected light to preselected surface portions of the
          interior sidewall of a cylindrically shaped solar energy
          receiver. The longitudinal axis of the receiver is tilted at
          an acute angle with respect to the optical axis such that the
          distribution of focussed solar energy over the interior
          surface of the solar engine is optimized for dynamic solar
          energy conversion. Each reflector panel section comprises a

          section is formed of a plurality of multi-segment lens panel
          strips each of which is supported in tension between the pair

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A method of manufacturing a solar
          concentrator employing a prism having a radiation input face,
          a reflection face and at least one radiation output face. The
          method comprises the steps of providing the prism with its
          reflection face angularly disposed with respect to the input
          face. A layer of light-sensitive material is deposited on the
          input face of the prism. An auxiliary prism and a substance
          having a refractive index close to that of the light-sensitive
          material is provided with the substance placed between the
          light-sensitive material and the auxiliary prism. Next, an
          interference pattern is recorded in the light-sensitive layer
          to obtain a three dimensional hologram. This is accomplished
          by using a reference laser beam and an object laser beam. The
          reference laser beam is sent to the light-sensitive layer via
          the auxiliary prism and the substance in the direction of
          propagation of the incident radiation to be concentrated. The
          object laser beam is directed via the auxiliary prism at an
          angle with respect to the light-sensitive layer such that
          fringe planes are formed in the light-sensitive layer in order
          to diffract incident radiation at the angle. The auxiliary
          prism and the substance are removed, and the light-sensitive
          layer is developed. The angular relationship between the
          reflection face, the input face and the angle are chosen to
          preclude the diffraction of a beam which has been reflected
          from the reflection face. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A collapsible structural assembly
          including first and second flexible sheets disposed in
          confronting relationship to one another is disclosed herein.
          The assembly also includes an arrangement of ribs located
          between and connected with the sheets so as to support the
          sheets as a single unit for movement between a first collapsed
          position such that the sheets lie flat and adjacent one
          another with the ribs therebetween and a second extended
          position such that sheets have predetermined curved
          configurations and the ribs serve as structural reinforcements
          therebetween. In the actual embodiment disclosed, one of the
          sheets includes an outermost light reflective surface and the
          predetermined curvature conferred upon the sheets including
          the light reflective surface is that of a parabola. In this
          way, the entire assembly may serve as a trough-line parabolic
          concentrator comprising part of an overall solar collector. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A device for improving the radiant solar
          energy collection efficiency of a helix shaped solar
          collector-concentrator by concentrating the sun's rays on a
          plurality of specifically positioned energy absorber
          collecting cores as the sun moves through its solar day
          without the use of active tracking devices, is provided. By
          using a helix shaped semi-tubular parabolic
          collector-concentrator with multiple specifically positioned
          collecting cores crossing and intersecting the shifting sharp
          focal axis of the reflective surfaces of the helix shape at a
          slight angle to the focal axis, rather than being exactly on
          the focal axis, at least one or more of the collecting core
          surfaces is in sharp focus at all times, thus optimizing the
          sun's radiant solar energy collection capacity of said device.
          Further increased primary direct and non-reflective incident
          solar energy is collected on a plurality of collecting cores
          providing additional collection efficiencies. The helix shaped
          semi-tubular parabolic reflector and the energy absorber cores
          are enclosed by a transparent, relatively air-tight covering
          which causes the device to be resistant to environmental
          factors such as snow, rain, wind, pollution and other
          atmospheric degradants. The additional confined heat energy
          generated and trapped within the covered helix shaped
          semi-tubular parabolic reflector further increases the
          device's collecting efficiency. In one embodiment the heat
          energy thus collected may be transferred to a heat absorbing
          medium to be utilized in a useful manner. In another
          embodiment the solar energy impinging on the energy absorber
          collecting cores may be converted by other means such as
          photoelectric conversion into electrical energy to be utilized
          and stored. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- Solar energy is converted into
          electricity by use of a solar concentrator system, a steam
          production system, a turbine and an alternator. A boiler is
          heated by a concentrator dish aimed at the sun. The dish may
          also be fitted with a polar mount, an actuator and a devise
          for sensing the relative position of the sun. There is a mast
          on the dish upon which a boiler is mounted which is heated by
          the sun's concentrated rays. The boiler will preferably be
          arranged to heat and vaporize water to create continuous steam
          that is delivered to turn the turbine which is operatively
          connected to the alternator and from which electricity is

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --- Solar-powered reactor for processing of
          slightly absorbing and transparent gases. An obvious path to
          providing storable, renewable energy is through solar
          dissociation of gas molecules. These dissociation products are
          the precursors of modern liquid and gaseous fuels such as
          hydrogen and methanol/ethanol. An apparatus and method using a
          solar concentrator (such as a focusing trough or dish)
          directed at the receiving end of a reactor are disclosed. A
          range of designs of reactors for the dissociation of gases,
          both those that absorb slightly in the visible spectrum and
          those that are transparent in the visible and only absorb in
          the infrared, is described. For slightly-absorbing gases, a
          funnel-shaped reactor that preheats the gas and concentrates
          sunlight is the indicated embodiment. A system for
          dissociating CO&lt;SUB&gt;2 &lt;/SUB&gt;using the invention is
          described. For transparent gases, a holraum embodiment is more
          appropriate for coupling solar energy into the gas. In both
          cases, heat from the hot stream of dissociated gas may also be
          used to produce electricity with a standard steam or Stirling
          cycle generator. </p>
