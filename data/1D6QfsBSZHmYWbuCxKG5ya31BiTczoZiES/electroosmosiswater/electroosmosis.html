        <b>Methods for enhancing phytoextraction of contaminants from
          porous media using electrokinetic phenomena</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>The present invention relates to a method of remediating soil,
      water, and other porous media contaminated with organic and/or
      inorganic contaminants using plants in conjunction with an
      electric field applied through the medium to control movement of
      the contaminants and enhance removal of the contaminants from the
      medium.&nbsp; Applying an electric field in soil induces
      electromigration (movement of ions in the pore fluid), as well as
      electroosmosis (movement of pore water) and electrophoresis
      (movement of charged particles in soil such as colloids). In the
      present invention these phenomena are beneficially utilized to
      control the transport of charged and/or non-charged contaminants
      in soil within the plant root zone (rhizosphere) and to bring
      contaminants into the root zone, perhaps from a contaminated zone
      located deeper in the soil than the root zone. The effectiveness
      of the phytoremediation is also enhanced by preventing the soil
      from becoming so strongly acidic or basic as to kill the plants.
      The present invention significantly extends the utility of
      phytoremediation to cleanup of soils with deeper contamination
      plumes than are typically accessible to the roots of plants.<br>

        <b><b> </b>Method of converting current for improving the soil
          by electroosmosis and the apparatus thereof</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>When an electric potential is applied across a wet soil mass,
      cations of double layer in a soil would be attracted to the
      cathode and anions to the anode. As these cations migrate to the
      cathode, they drag water with them. Because there are more cations
      than anions in a soil containing negatively charged clay
      particles, there is a net flow of water towards the cathode. Since
      the flows of water towards the cathode cause soil consolidation.
      The electroosmosis of ground improvement on soft ground has been
      carried out by Casagrande. However, the method was not applied
      widely. It uses the filter or the rectifier to filter the minus
      wave of the alternating current having the sine wave of alternate
      plus and minus or to convert the minus wave to plus wave. Electric
      potential is applied by the harmonic wave of direct current, and
      the chloride and silicate solutions are injected via the grouting
      pipe near the anode and the relaying grouting pipe into soil. The
      injected chloride and silicate solutions increase conductivity of
      the soil and amount of drained water. Such process will also cause
      soil particles cemented. The new electroosmosis with the injection
      of chloride saline solution and the relaying grouting pipe can
      certainly enhance the electroosmostic effect of improvement,
      shorten the time of treatment and increase improvement range.
      Furthermore, owing to use the filter or the rectifier to replace
      the traditional rectifier transforming to constant voltage, it can
      reduce substantially the facility cost of electroosmosis.<br>

        <b><b> </b>METHOD AND DEVICE FOR TREATING WATER-CONTAINING SOIL
          ON SITE BY ELECTROOSMOSIS</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>PURPOSE:To directly treat water-contg. soil on the treating
      site with a simple structure and to provide a device capable of
      treating the soil by electroosmosis without <br>
      contaminating the environment around the site. CONSTITUTION:An
      electrode combination 2 consisting of a central electrode 2A and
      plural peripheral electrodes 2B surrounding the electrode 2A is
      successively and adjacently arranged in the water-contg. soil
      treating region. Current and voltage are impressed in parallel
      between the electrode combinations to dehydrate the soil by
      electroosmosis, and then the polarity of the impressed voltage is
      inverted to restore the value of the treating region.; Since the
      structure is simple and a mechanically operating part is not
      needed, the soil is directly treated on the site, and the
      secondary contamination of the treated soil or its surroundings
      due to the change in # value is prevented as a current is applied
      in the reverse direction.<br>

        <b>Method and device for regulating and optimizing transport of
          humidity by means of electroosmosis</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In a method for regulating and optimizing transport of liquid in a
      porous structure by means of electroosmosis, a pulse pattern
      applied to one or more electrode pairs which are used during the
      electroosmosis is regulated by detecting a potential difference
      INCREMENT Vp over the electrode pair or electrode pairs during the
      duration t3 of a neutral pulse which forms part of the pulse
      pattern and subsequently regulating either the duration t3 of the
      neutral pulse or the duration Tp of the pulse pattern or both on
      the basis of the detected potential difference INCREMENT Vp and
      any change therein from measuring cycle to measuring cycle. A
      device for implementing the method comprises a power source with a
      pulse generator which supplies the desired pulse patterns to one
      or more electrode pairs (A, K) with the anode (A) provided in the
      porous structure and the cathode (K) in earth respectively, a
      voltage detector connected in series via each electrode pair (A,
      K) and a program control unit in a loop between the voltage
      detector and the power source's pulse generator.<br>

        <b>Method and apparatus for controlling the relative humidity in
          concrete and masonry structures</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>In a method for eliminating humidity from concrete and masonry
      structures by means of electroosmosis, current pulses which are
      supplied in a determined pattern are used. The pulse voltage is
      limited to +/-40 V. In order to generate the pulses and feed the
      electrodes a special electronic control device is used. The
      invention relates to a method and means for controlling the
      relative humidity in concrete and masonry, including masonry
      wherein cement is used as a bonding agent. The structure may be
      reinforced or not, and the method may also be used in plaster,
      mortar in stone masonry and light concrete structures.<br>
