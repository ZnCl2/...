      A machine that 'sieves' the blood could save thousands from
      falling victim to deadly sepsis infections.<br>
      <br>
      The device has been created by a British scientist who said it
      could also save the NHS huge sums by getting patients out of
      hospital quickly.<br>
      <br>
      Working in a similar way to dialysis, the blood is removed – but
      in this case it is cleaned of dangerous microbes using magnets.<br>
      <br>
      The machine is to undergo the first human clinical trials next
      year and is also being tested for use against blood-borne diseases
      such as malaria and leukaemia. <br>
      <br>
      Dr George Frodsham, who came up with the idea while studying for a
      PhD at University College London, said: 'This is early-stage
      technology we are doing, we have got a prototype but at the moment
      this is in-lab concept work.<br>
      <br>
      'But it could save the NHS a lot of money. Sepsis patients are
      very expensive if they hang around in intensive care.'<br>
      <br>
      Sepsis, known as the 'silent killer', hits when an infection such
      as blood poisoning sparks a violent immune response in which the
      body attacks its own organs.<br>
      <br>
      The leading cause of avoidable death in the UK, it kills at least
      44,000 a year.<br>
      <br>
      Antibiotics can control the infection if it is caught early, but
      without a quick diagnosis there is little doctors can do to
      control its spread.<br>
      <br>
      Dr George Frodsham, who came up with the idea while studying for a

      <br>
      The Mail launched its End the Sepsis Scandal campaign in the wake
      of revelations following the death of 12-month-old William Mead in
      2014.<br>
      <br>
      It emerged there had been a catalogue of errors, misdiagnoses and
      missed opportunities by doctors and NHS helpline staff. Dr
      Frodsham's machine – known as the MediSieve – aims to stop
      infections even at a late stage. <br>
      <br>
      Designed to be used by intensive care units, blood is removed from
      veins in the patient's arm and enters the machine, where magnetic
      particles are added.<br>
      <br>
      These are designed to seek out and bind to the dangerous bacteria
      that cause sepsis as well as little floating scraps of old
      microbes known as endotoxins, which are known to accelerate the
      violent immune response called the 'septic cascade'.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Ron Daniels, of the UK Sepsis Trust, said: ‘Any novel
      therapeutic technology which aims to improve outcomes from sepsis
      has the potential to help thousands of people.’ Pictured: 2006

      Once bonded together, they are caught by a powerful magnet and the
      'cleaned' blood is then returned to the body. <br>
      <br>
      Dr Frodsham, whose design is unveiled at the Royal Academy of
      Engineering Enterprise Hub Showcase in London today, said: 'It all
      happens in the machine – the magnetic particles never enter the
      body. It should take a couple of hours to get through the entire
      blood flow, but that will change person to person.'<br>

      MediSieve is the developer of a groundbreaking drug-free malaria
      treatment. Using a magnetic sieve to physically remove malaria
      infected blood cells directly from a patient’s bloodstream,
      MediSieve is a life-saving intervention for severe and
      drug-resistant malaria patients.<br>
      <br>
      Founded in 2015, MediSieve has raised £350,000 in seed funding
      from angel investors. The company aims to perform first-in-man
      clinical trials on the malaria device by the end of 2016...<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Device</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Almost half of the world’s population – 3.2 billion – are at risk
      of malaria<br>
      There are about 200 million cases and 600,000 deaths every year<br>
      A child dies of malaria every minute<br>
      Malaria is spread by female Anopheles mosquitoes<br>
      Malaria breeds mostly in warmer climates, where there is an
      abundance of humidity and rain<br>
      Drug-resistance is spreading in SE Asia<br>
      <br>
      MediSieve’s malaria treatment method is similar to dialysis in
      that a patient’s blood is continuously circulated through a
      magnetic filter device via an external blood loop. Red blood cells
      infected with the malaria parasite are captured in the filter. The
      healthy blood returns to the patient unharmed.<br>
      <br>
      Operating with very high flow rates, the device could reduce a
      child’s infection burden by 90 per cent in just 3.5 hours.<br>
      <br>
      Our ambition is for MediSieve’s treatment to become an essential
      treatment for severe and drug-resistant patients, particularly for
      children and pregnant women.. The critical problem with these
      patients is that they only receive antimalarial drugs once their
      infection burden is too high for the treatment to be effective.<br>
      <br>
      MediSieve is offering the chance to turn back the clock for these
      patients. Providing rapid and safe removal of malaria-infected
      cells directly from the bloodstream, this device could be used as
      a standalone treatment or in combination with drugs, improving
      treatment effectiveness and saving lives.<br>

      <br>
      A hemofilter system. In one embodiment, the hemofilter system
      includes a container having a first surface, a second surface, and
      one or more wall surfaces, the first surface, the second surface
      and the one or more wall surfaces defining a volume; an input port
      in fluid communication with the first surface; an output port in
      fluid communication with the second surface; a filter bed
      comprising a plurality of planar magnetic meshes stacked in close
      juxtaposition and positioned within the container volume and
      coplanar with the first and second surfaces; a first magnet
      positioned on a first surface of the container; a second magnet
      positioned on the second surface of the container; a first input
      conduit in fluid communication with the input port; and a first
      output conduit in fluid communication with the output port. In
      another embodiment, the hemofilter system includes a pump in the
      input conduit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The invention relates generally to blood filtering systems
      and more specifically to magnetic filtering systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Magnetic separation has been used in mineral processing for
      years. Generally, it is used to separate out magnetic minerals
      from mixtures containing non-magnetic materials. In such a
      separation system, a suspension of particles in a liquid is passed
      through a magnetisable filter constructed of magnetic wires. Near
      the wires, a high field gradient results in a magnetic retaining
      force that attracts any passing magnetisable material.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] These magnetic separation techniques can be used with
      magnetic hemofiltration to remove from the bloodstream anything
      that is either intrinsically magnetic (i.e., departs significantly
      from the diamagnetism of normal blood and blood components) or is
      magnetically labelled with magnetic nanoparticles or beads that
      target specific blood-borne agents which are available and can be
      used clinically.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] What is needed is a magnetic filter that is capable of
      extracting magnetically labeled targets in the bloodstream
      quickly, efficiently and at low cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The present invention addresses these requirements.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] One aspect of the invention is a hemofilter system. In one
      embodiment, the hemofilter system includes a container having a
      first surface, a second surface, and one or more wall surfaces,
      the first surface, the second surface and the one or more wall
      surfaces defining a volume; an input port in fluid communication
      with the first surface; an output port in fluid communication with
      the second surface; a filter bed comprising a plurality of planar
      magnetic meshes stacked in close juxtaposition and positioned
      within the container volume within the path of fluid from the
      input port to the output port; a first magnet positioned on a
      first surface of the container; a first input conduit in fluid
      communication with the input port; and a first output conduit in
      fluid communication with the output port wherein the first magnet
      produces a magnetic field that is modified by the presence of the
      planar magnetic meshes in such a way as to produce a sufficiently
      strong and inhomogeneous magnetic field in the free space within
      the filter bed to allow the capture of blood-borne magnetic
      targets. In another embodiment, a second magnet is positioned on a
      second surface of the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In yet another embodiment, the hemofilter system includes a
      pump in the input conduit. In still another embodiment, the
      hemofilter system includes a saline drip unit in fluid
      communication with the input conduit. In yet another embodiment,
      the hemofilter system includes a saline reservoir and a syringe
      pump connected in parallel fluid communication with the first
      conduit through a T-junction. In still yet another embodiment, the
      hemofilter system includes an air detector in fluid communication
      with the output conduit. In one embodiment, the hemofilter system
      includes a pressure detector in fluid communication with the
      output conduit.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In another aspect, the invention is a hemofilter including
      a container having a first surface, a second surface, and one or
      more wall surfaces, the first surface, the second surface and the
      one or more wall surfaces defining a volume; an input port in
      fluid communication with the first surface; an output port in
      fluid communication with the second surface; a filter bed
      comprising a plurality of planar magnetic meshes stacked in close
      juxtaposition and positioned within the container volume and
      coplanar with the first and second surfaces; a first magnet
      positioned on a first surface of the container; a second magnet is
      positioned on a second surface of the container; wherein the first
      and second magnets produce a magnetic field that is perpendicular
      to the planar magnetic meshes and which produces a sufficiently
      strong and inhomogeneous magnetic field in the free space within
      the filter bed to allow the capture of blood-borne magnetic
      targets.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In yet another embodiment, the filter is designed to
      produce a uniform flow characteristic at a millimeter-scale length
      so as to avoid dead-spots and eddies, and to maintain a sufficient
      rate of flow overall by producing a labyrinthine flow pathway for
      each individual red blood cell that passes through the filter. In
      one embodiment, the flow causes a red blood cell to deviate from
      its unimpeded flow by more than three times the diameter of the
      red blood cell. In another embodiment, the deviation from
      unimpeded flow is by more than about 20 microns.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In general, the hemofilter is designed to produce a
      three-dimensional, braided, laminar flow on the part of the blood
      that passes through the filter. In this aspect, the flow of the
      blood is like that of a meandering riverbed, but through a
      three-dimensional volume rather than over a two-dimensional
      surface. In one embodiment, the stack of planar metal-wire meshes
      are arranged in such a way that the blood passing through the
      filter separates into a series of laminar flow channels that
      serially divide and recombine as they move through each layer of
      mesh. The laminarity of the flow is retained throughout the
      entirety of the mesh-stack-filled portion of the filter, so that
      at no time during the passage of the blood is it subjected to any
      violent or potentially damaging turbulent motion. At the same
      time, the serial division and recombination of the laminar flow
      channels ensures that each and every fraction of the blood—such as
      for example a given individual red blood cell or
      magnetically-labeled biomolecule—has a finite, greater-than-zero
      probability of physically encountering at least one capture site
      (defined as being the volume of space sufficiently close to the
      magnetically actuating mesh that, for a magnetic or magnetically
      labeled entity of the anticipated magnetic character, moving at
      the anticipated speed, the entity will be captured (retained and
      held) as it transits the mesh-stack-filled portion of the filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] In one embodiment, the multi-layer stack of wire meshes is
      arranged in such a way that the laminar flow channels that the
      blood separates into as it passes through the mesh-stack-filled
      portion of the filter is highly regularized, so that the
      three-dimensional pattern of flow channel division and
      recombination would take on a regular, well-defined structure.
      Such an embodiment is achieved by having the mesh layers arranged
      in space in a repeated, sequential, and aligned fashion.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In another embodiment of this aspect of the hemofilter, the
      multi-layer stack of wire meshes is arranged in such a way that
      the laminar flow channels that the blood separates into as it
      passes through the mesh-stack-filled portion of the filter are
      more random, stochastic or convoluted, so that the
      three-dimensional pattern of flow channel division and
      recombination would take on an irregular, random structure. Such
      an embodiment is achieved by having the mesh layers arranged in
      space in a non-aligned, random fashion.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In a further aspect, the hemofilter is designed in such a
      way that the Reynolds number of the blood passing through the
      mesh-stack-filled region of the filter is typical of that of a
      laminar, rather than turbulent, or transitional (meaning
      intermediate between laminar and turbulent) flow. The Reynolds
      number can be defined in several ways, two of which are described
      here for illustrative purposes, and the operator should apply the
      appropriate definition to the embodiment of hemofilter used. In
      the first case, the Reynolds number is defined as Re=ρv L/μ, where
      ρ is the density of blood (ca. 1.06×10&lt;3 &gt;kg m&lt;−3&gt;), v
      is the mean velocity of the blood as it passes through the filter,
      L is a characteristic dimension of the filter such as the mesh
      aperture size, and μ is the viscosity of blood (ca. 3-4×10&lt;−3
      &gt;Pa s). In this case, Re is less than or of order 2300 for
      laminar flow. In the second case, the Reynolds number is that
      which is defined for randomly packed beds of hard spheres, Re*=ρu
      d/ρ(1−ε), where ρ and μ are defined as before, u is the
      superficial flow rate of the blood through the filter (given by
      the volumetric flow rate through the filter divided by the
      macroscopic cross-sectional area of the filter), d is the
      spherical equivalent particle diameter (i.e. the diameter of the
      spheres that would occupy the same volume of space as that
      occupied by the given filter mesh material), and ε is the bed
      voidage (meaning the volumetric fraction of the filter that is not
      occupied by the filter material). In this case, Re* is less than
      or of order 10 for laminar flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In a yet further aspect, the hemofilter is designed to
      provide efficient capture at flow rates and at filter volumes
      commensurate with both the rate of flow of blood to and from a
      human artery or vein, and acceptable safety limits on the amount
      of blood that can be held extracorporeally at any given time. For
      children, this corresponds to flow rates from 40 to 200 ml/min,
      and extracorporeal volumes of order 8% of the total blood
      volume—which for example in a 5 year old child weighing 20 kg
      would be of order 0.08×1.6 litres=128 ml. In adults, this
      corresponds to flow rates from 40 to 400 ml/min, and
      extracorporeal volumes of order 8% of the total blood volume−which
      for example in an 80 kg adult would be of order 0.08×6.4
      litres=512 ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In a still further aspect, the hemofilter is designed to
      contain quiescent capture zones for the retention and safe
      collection of fragile or delicate biological entities. This aspect
      requires that the capture zones be intrinsically active with
      respect to flow—as otherwise they would constitute ‘dead zones’
      through which the blood would not pass—while also being suitable
      as receptacles of the targeted and captured biological entities.
      In one embodiment, these quiescent capture zones are located along
      the lengths of opposite sides of wires magnetized perpendicularly
      to the orientation of the wire and parallel to the direction of
      flow, creating areas of high magnetic force and low drag force,
      facilitating capture.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      [0044] Referring to FIG. 1, a system 10 constructed in accordance
      with an embodiment of the invention includes an input port 14 and
      an output port 18. In one embodiment, the input 14 and output 18
      ports include Luer-type connectors configured to engage the
      corresponding mating Luer-type connector of a patient's catheter.
      Blood from the patient is drawn into the system 10 through the
      input port 14 with a pump 22 connected to an input conduit 25. In
      one embodiment, the pump is a peristaltic pump. The other end of
      the input line also includes a Luer-type connector 30 positioned
      to engage a corresponding mating Luer-type connector 32 configured
      as the input port 26 of a magnetic filter 34.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A Luer-type connector of the output port 38 of the magnetic
      filter 34 engages a Luer-type connector 36 at one end of the
      system output conduit 42. The other end of the system output
      conduit 42 includes a Luer-type connector that acts as the system
      output port 18. The Luer-type output port engages a catheter that
      returns blood to the patient. In one embodiment, the peristaltic
      pump 22 is an infusion pump, (Baxter International, Deerfield,
      Ill., infusion pump model BM-11) and includes an output circuit
      that includes a gas trap with filter 43 and an air detector 46 to
      detect and/or filter air bubbles in the blood flow (arrows). In
      this embodiment, the peristaltic pump includes a pressure sensor
      48 in the output circuit to assure that the pressure of the blood
      flowing back into the patient is within the desired limits. Also
      in this embodiment the output circuit includes an emergency clamp
      47 that can stop flow through the circuit if bubbles are detected.
      In various embodiments, the input 25 and output conduits 42 are
      constructed of air-permeable tubing. In one embodiment, the output
      conduit 42 is attached to a collection receptacle 74. In another
      embodiment, the output conduit 42 is connected to a cannula 77 to
      return a patient's blood to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In one embodiment, a controller 73 controls the syringe
      pump 64 through a digital port 61 and the peristaltic pump 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In another embodiment, a saline drip subsystem 54 is
      connected through Luer connectors 63 to the input line 25 through
      a first T-connector 50. In one embodiment, the saline drip
      subsystem 54 includes a saline reservoir drip bag 62 having a
      manual IV line control valve 65. The input line 26 is connected to
      the input of a peristaltic pump 22 through a second T-connector
      67. A second port of the second T-connector 67 is connected to an
      input pressure sensor 69 to measure the fluid pressure at the
      input line 25 prior to the pump 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The output of the peristaltic pump 22 is connected to a
      syringe pump 64 having a syringe pump driver 66 controlling the
      flow of an anticoagulant, such as heparin, from a syringe 70
      through a third T-connector 74. The output 78 of this third
      T-connector 74 is a second input to the input conduit 26. This
      anti-coagulant subsystem assures that no clotting of the patient's
      blood occurs as it passes through the system 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In more detail, and referring to FIGS. 2 and 3A-D, the
      magnetic filter 34 includes an outer container 82. In one
      embodiment, the outer container 82 is made of a disposable plastic
      or a sterilizable material. In one embodiment, the plastic is a
      medical-grade plastic such as a polyethylene, polycarbonate or
      silicone. In one embodiment, the inner surfaces of the container
      and the mesh are coated with an anticoagulant. In one embodiment,
      the anticoagulant coating is a composite polysaccharide with
      embedded heparin. The outer container 82 is typically permanently
      sealed by top 83 and bottom 85 lids but may be configured to be
      opened for cleaning and refurbishment. The size of the container
      housing 82 is determined in part by the size of the patient to
      whom the system is to be connected. If the volume of the filter 34
      is too large, the patient will experience a reaction due to excess
      blood loss. If the volume is too small, the amount of time needed
      to move a significant fraction of the patient's blood through the
      device becomes excessive.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Generally, in nephrology, the maximum amount of blood to be
      withdrawn from a patient in an extracorporeal loop is 8% of the
      patient's blood volume. The average adult has about five liters of
      blood so the amount of blood in the extracorporeal circuit should
      be less than about 400 ml. Reducing this further by 50% to account
      for the fact that some of the patients will be anemic, the volume
      of the extracorporeal circuit becomes about 200 ml. This volume
      must be reduced for children. For an infant under 12 months of age
      the volume of the system is about 30 ml. The tubing and connectors
      of the system are assumed to contain about 10 ml of blood and that
      means that the housing volume will vary from about 20 ml for
      infants to about 190 ml for an adult.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Because the outer container 82 includes a magnetic metal
      mesh filter that occupies up to one third of the volume of the
      container, the actual container volumes are about one third
      greater than the desired blood volume. Thus, a chamber sized for
      an adult (about 190 ml of blood) is about 250 ml in volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The shape of the container is designed to increase flow
      rate through the container by reducing the drag force. To reduce
      the drag force, the container is constructed to have one pair of
      surfaces, for example top and bottom, with a larger surface area
      compared to the other (in this embodiment, four) surfaces of the
      container. Note that in this discussion the filter is discussed,
      without the loss of generality, as a rectangular parallelepiped
      but other shapes including cylindrical are contemplated. In one
      embodiment, the flow of blood is then oriented perpendicularly
      between the two larger surfaces. For example, if a volume of 125
      ml is desired, rather than constructing the container to have each
      edge of the six surfaces being 5 cm (5×5×5 cm), it is advantageous
      to have dimensions of 12.5×10×1 cm, so that the top and bottom
      surfaces are 125 cm&lt;2&gt;. In the first case (5 cm for each
      edge of each surface), the largest surface area is 25 cm&lt;2&gt;.
      In the second example, the area of the largest surfaces (top and
      bottom) is 125 cm&lt;2&gt;. Since the linear flow velocity of a
      liquid for a given volumetric flow rate depends on the area of the
      surface through which the liquid flows, maximizing the surface
      area minimizes the linear flow velocity, and thus the drag force.
      Thus, the drag would be reduced by a factor of five for flow
      between the two largest surfaces. It is important to note however,
      that increasing one side at the expense of the others will reduce
      the height of the filter bed.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] To make use of the increased surface area, it is necessary
      to divert the input blood flow so that it spreads out over the
      larger surface. Referring again to FIG. 3A-D, the input port 26 of
      the container provides blood flow through a flow homogenizer or
      disperser 80. As the blood passes down the tube 80 (FIG. 3C), the
      tube becomes wider and flatter causing the blood to spread over
      the surface as the volume fills, eventually reaching the output
      port 38. In some embodiments, the blood flows through a flow
      homogenizer or diverter before exiting at output port 38 in order
      to maintain flow homogeneity at the top of the chamber. Other
      forms of diverters or homogenizers are possible. It should be
      noted that although this system is generally described with the
      input port 26 at the bottom and the output port 38 at the top, the
      orientation of the container is not relevant, although if the
      volume of blood flow is between the two largest surfaces,
      efficiency is increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] One issue with a container having orthogonal walls is that
      the corners where the walls meet form “dead spaces” where fluid
      collects and does not flow with the majority flow through the
      container. These dead spaces in some embodiments are removed by
      forming continuous non-orthogonal surfaces where the walls of the
      corner of a container meet (FIG. 3B). In one embodiment, the inner
      surfaces of the container are coated with a hydrophobic coating.
      In one embodiment, the hydrophobic coating is a silicone based
      polymer such as polydimethylsiloxane.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Referring to FIGS. 5A, B, within the container 82 is a
      filter bed through which the blood entering the container 82
      passes as it flows to the output port 38. In one embodiment, the
      filter bed is constructed as a plurality of planar meshes 100,
      100′ . . . 100″, (generally 100) stacked together. In one
      embodiment, the plane of the mesh is preferably perpendicular to
      the flow of blood through the container volume. The mesh is
      constructed of non-diamagnetic (including, but not limited to,
      ferro or ferri strands) wires 104′ . . . 104″ (generally 104)
      woven to an aperture spacing (generally 108) of 10-1000 microns
      and preferably of 50 microns between the wires. In one embodiment,
      the non-diamagnetic wires are SS430 stainless steel, with a wire
      diameter of 10-1000 microns and preferably 250 microns. In one
      embodiment, such a configuration of at least one hundred layers of
      mesh corresponds to approximately thirty mm in thickness. The
      meshes 100 are stacked, each mesh randomly offset from the
      previous layer such that the spacings between the wires of each
      mesh are staggered to form interrupted channels through the filter
      bed (FIG. 5B). A blood cell flowing through the filter bed
      therefore has a high probability of encountering multiple wires as
      it flows up the channel. As a result of the higher magnetic fields
      in the free space adjacent to the wires, as described below,
      magnetic or magnetically labeled components within the flow of
      blood experiences a magnetic retarding force component slowing the
      flow. FIG. 5C is a graph of the effect on the drag force of the
      ratio of the wire diameter to the length of the side of the
      aperture. That is, as the wire diameter becomes larger relative to
      the side of the aperture, the drag force increases rapidly due to
      the decrease in aperture size.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Referring to FIGS. 6A-F, the magnetic mesh filters may take
      on many forms or weaves; several embodiments are herein discussed.
      FIG. 6A is an embodiment of a magnetic mesh filter in a Dutch
      weave configuration. In Dutch weave, the “warp” and “weft” wires
      have different diameters. FIG. 6B is a side view of an embodiment
      of a magnetic filter mesh in a Dutch weave configuration, FIG. 6C
      is a perspective plan view of the same magnetic filter mesh of
      FIG. 6B. FIG. 6D is a plan view of a magnetic filter mesh in a
      plain or one over another weave configuration. FIG. 6E is an
      embodiment of the mesh of the magnetic filter of FIG. 6D in which
      the spacing between the wires in each direction is different. FIG.
      6F is an embodiment of the mesh of a magnetic filter in twill
      weave configuration. In general, the weaves are chosen such that
      areas of substantially maximum magnetic retarding forces overlap
      with the areas of substantially minimum viscoelastic drag forces
      as discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Referring to FIG. 7, to establish the appropriate magnetic
      field in the mesh, in one embodiment, the container 82 containing
      the mesh filter is placed adjacent a permanent magnet 120. In a
      second embodiment FIG. 8, to increase the magnetic field, two
      permanent magnets 120, 120′ orientated with the same polarity are
      applied to the opposite sides of the container 82 such that the
      magnetic field 124 is perpendicular to the planes of the meshes
      100. This embodiment includes a keeper 126 to provide a return
      path for the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Such a configuration induces an approximately equal
      magnetic field acting on each of the wires 100 and 104 forming
      each aperture 108 in the mesh. However, given that the mesh is
      made from a ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic material that is
      intrinsically magnetizable (leading to an induced magnetization
      within the wires), the magnetic field acting within each aperture
      108 in the mesh is modified to become the superposition of the
      field due to the permanent magnets 120 and 120′ and the magnetic
      field generated by the magnetized wires 100, 100′, 100″ etc. and
      104, 104′, 104″ etc. The field due to the magnetized wires is
      approximately that of a magnetic dipole, and is therefore maximal
      in the direction of the magnetizing field, and falls off rapidly
      (scaling as 1/r&lt;3 &gt;where r is distance from the wire) along
      the direction of the magnetizing field (FIG. 9). A color coded
      legend is shown on the left side of the figure such that colors
      are used to represent magnetic field strength ranging from about 0
      Tesla (dark blue) to about 0.60 Tesla (dark pink).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Still referring to FIG. 9, a first pair of dotted arrows
      extends from the top of the figure legend on the left and point to
      the high field values (about 0.6 Tesla, dark pink) in the
      direction of the magnetic field as shown near the top and bottom
      of the cross-section of the wire. A second pair of arrows extends
      from the bottom of the legend and point to the low field values
      (approaching zero, dark blue) on the left and right sides of the
      wire cross-section. A solid arrow and another dotted arrow are
      also included to emphasize two additional points (about 0.15 Tesla
      and about 0.48 Tesla) in the field to give further context to the
      legend. The summed magnetic field is therefore strongest, and has
      the highest field gradients in the near vicinity of each wire. If
      a fluid containing magnetic targets is then passed through the
      filter mesh in such a way that the flow direction is parallel to
      the direction of the magnetizing field, then, as shown in FIG. 10,
      a region of maximal magnetic trapping is created adjacent each of
      the wires of the mesh, that region being characterized as one with
      a combination of relatively large magnetic retarding forces and
      relatively small viscoelastic drag forces.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The magnetic force (Fm) experienced by a magnetic particle
      passing near the wires of the mesh is given by the expression:<br>
      <br>
      Fm=μoχVH∇H<br>
      <br>
      where μ0 is the permeability of free space, χ is the volumetric
      magnetic susceptibility of the magnetic material, V is the volume
      of magnetic material in the particle, H is the magnetic field
      adjacent the wire (χVH being the total magnetic moment, M, of the
      particle), ∇H is the magnetic field gradient near each wire, and
      bolding indicates a vector. Close to the wires of the mesh, the
      magnetic field gradient becomes large.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Similarly, the drag force (Fd)) applied a spherical object
      in a liquid flow is described by Stokes' law, and is a good
      approximation for the drag force felt by the magnetized and/or
      magnetizable entities the filter is to capture:<br>
      <br>
      Fd=6πμRv<br>
      <br>
      where μ is the liquid viscosity, R is the radius of the cell, and
      v is the velocity of the liquid relative to the cell. The velocity
      v of the liquid exerting a force on a particle is dependent on the
      volumetric flow rate, f (ml/min) and the cross-sectional flow area
      C, and is given by the expression:<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Because the filter chamber cross-sectional area is reduced
      by the amount of space taken up by the wires of the mesh, the
      actual cross-sectional area of the filter is reduced and therefore
      the liquid flow velocity, and hence also the drag force Fd is
      dependent on γ, the fractional change in area, which in turn is
      dependent on x, the ratio between d, the diameter of each wire,
      and l, the length of one side of an aperture in the mesh,<br>
      <br>
      [mathematical formula][mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0063] If the diameter of the wire is 1⁄5 of the length of the
      aperture side, the cross-sectional area of the filter decreases to
      70% and the flow rate is decreased to 44%. The effect of the ratio
      x on the drag force is shown in FIG. 5C.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] For capture to occur, the drag force Fd must be less than
      the magnetic force Fm. To assure this relationship is met, the
      following options may be used in the design and deployment of the
      device. The magnetic force may be increased by increasing the
      magnetic field H by varying the type and configuration of
      permanent magnets or electromagnets creating the external field
      (as discussed below). Alternatively, the field gradient ∇H may be
      varied or optimized by: optimizing the magnitude of H for the
      particular dimensions and magnetic properties of the wires; using
      a ferromagnetic mesh with a higher magnetic susceptibility or
      higher magnetic saturation; or optimizing the diameter of the wire
      consistent with the magnetic field. The capture of a specific
      target such as a magnetic particle can be improved by increasing
      the magnetic moment of the magnetic particle either by increasing
      the volume of magnetic material of the target or by using a
      material with higher magnetic susceptibility.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Further, one could increase the likelihood of a target
      passing through an area of high field gradient. In the case of a
      target flowing through the aperture of a mesh, the magnetic force
      is lowest in the center of the aperture. The use of a randomized
      stacked mesh design, with a large number of layers, ensures that
      targets have a very low probability of never passing through areas
      of high gradient (i.e. close to the surface of a wire). Further
      decreasing the drag force may also be accomplished by: lowering
      the velocity of the targets (this may be undesirable since it
      would increase the overall treatment time); increasing the
      cross-sectional flow area (which also may be undesirable as it is
      limited by the total volume of blood that can be removed from a
      patient in an extra-corporeal loop (typically 8% of TBV); or using
      a mesh with a higher aperture size-to-wire diameter ratio (i.e.,
      lower x). This last option must be balanced with ensuring the
      apertures are small enough that sufficient targets pass close to
      the wires, because large apertures may create flow paths through
      the channels in which a particle never enters an area of high
      magnetic gradient.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Because of the cost and difficulty in producing and
      handling large magnets, and in order to obtain an advantageous
      magnetic circuit design, in one embodiment (FIG. 11), a plurality
      of smaller magnets 120 are grouped together before placement on
      opposite sides of the container 82. In one embodiment, pairs of
      the magnets 120 are magnetically or otherwise attached to a steel
      back plate 134 which extends a small distance beyond the magnets
      120. The steel back plate 134 helps to focus the magnetic field
      and shield the area adjacent to the filter. Steel back plate 134
      then rests on a lip 138 in a first part of frame 142. The second
      portion of the frame 146 has a plurality of openings sized and
      shaped to permit the magnets 130 to protrude through the frame 146
      and still be held in alignment. The first 142 and second 146
      portions of the aluminum frame are bolted 160 together (FIG. 12)
      to form a magnet assembly that along with a second magnet assembly
      are the two magnets 120, 120′ that are positioned on opposite
      surfaces of the container 82. In this way, the container 82 can be
      removed from between the magnet assemblies 160 and the container
      replaced for use with another patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In one embodiment, the magnets are N42 grade NdFeB
      (Neodymium Iron Boron) with a pull of 32.2 kg, a surface flux
      density of 3,000 gauss and BH max energy product of 40-43 Oe. The
      magnets 130 are strong enough to produce a force between a pair of
      the magnets of 45N at a separation of 30 mm and 200N at a
      separation of ten mm.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] How the system is used clinically to remove detrimental
      materials from the blood is determined in part by the nature of
      the material to be removed. Materials that are non-diamagnetic in
      and of themselves, such as malarial infected red cells, which are
      intrinsically paramagnetic (due to the presence of hemozoin—the
      paramagnetic mineral byproduct of the parasite's metabolizing of
      hemoglobin), may be directly removed by passing the cells through
      the magnetic filter 34. Diamagnetic targets such as viruses,
      bacteria or other toxins may be removed by labelling those targets
      with non-diamagnetic entities, such as for example suitably
      surface-functionalized ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic
      nanoparticles. The principle is, for example, to coat the magnetic
      nanoparticles with a suitable entity, such as an antibody or
      antibody fragment, or a suitable ligand, for which a corresponding
      antigen or receptor resides in some abundance on the surface of
      the target entities. Under favorable conditions and with suitably
      designed selective targeting, it is then possible to mix the
      surface-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles with the patient's
      blood—for example by injecting the functionalized nanoparticles
      into the patient's bloodstream, or into the extracorporeal loop at
      a position upstream from the magnetic filter 34—to thereby
      magnetically label the target entities, and to thereafter remove
      those entities by passing them through the magnetic filter 34.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In operation, a catheter is placed into a blood vessel of a
      patient and the Luer-type or other connector of the catheter is
      connected to the Luer-type connector 14 of the input conduit 25.
      In one embodiment, the catheter has an input lumen that is
      connected to the input conduit 25 of the system 10 and an output
      lumen that is connected to the output conduit 42 of the system 10.
      The input conduit 25 draws blood from the input lumen of the
      catheter upstream from the discharge of blood which is replaced
      from the output conduit 42 through the output lumen of the
      catheter. In another embodiment, the input conduit of the system
      is connected to a single lumen catheter and the output conduit is
      connected to a second single lumen catheter. The two catheters can
      then be introduced into different veins or arteries of the
      patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In more detail, the pump 22 in the input conduit 26 draws
      blood from the patient and passes it through the magnetic filter
      34. The saline drip 62 is mixed with heparin from a syringe pump
      64 and mixes with the blood flowing through the input conduit 25.
      Once the blood passes through the filter 34, it is pumped through
      the output conduit 42 back into the patient through another lumen
      of the catheter or another catheter in the blood vessel of the
      patient. An air detector 46 assures that no air bubbles are in the
      blood stream returning to the patient. An air bubble removal
      device 43 can be included to remove any bubbles from the blood
      stream. In one embodiment, the air bubble removal is achieved by
      using gas-permeable plastic tubing throughout the blood circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] FIG. 13 is a graph of a model calculation of the removal of
      blood cells infected with a parasite, such as malaria, from the
      blood as a function of total blood filtered assuming a 90% single
      pass efficiency, a 2% initial parasite load and a total blood
      volume of 5 L. As this graph shows, with this present system the
      bacterial, viral, parasitic, or toxic load on a patient can be
      removed or lowered using simple filtration. This is especially
      important in locations where drugs to treat the infection are
      difficult to obtain.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] A number of implementations have been described.
      Nevertheless, it will be understood that various modifications may
      be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the
      disclosure. For example, various forms of the flows shown above
      may be used, with steps re-ordered, added, or removed.
      Accordingly, other implementations are within the scope of the
      following claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The examples presented herein are intended to illustrate
      potential and specific implementations of the present disclosure.
      The examples are intended primarily for purposes of illustration
      of the invention for those skilled in the art. No particular
      aspect or aspects of the examples are necessarily intended to
      limit the scope of the present invention. The figures and
      descriptions of the present invention have been simplified to
      illustrate elements that are relevant for a clear understanding of
      the present invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity,
      other elements. Those of ordinary skill in the art may recognize,
      however, that these sorts of focused discussions would not
      facilitate a better understanding of the present disclosure, and
      therefore, a more detailed description of such elements is not
      provided herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The processes associated with the present embodiments may
      be executed by programmable equipment, such as computers. Software
      or other sets of instructions that may be employed to cause
      programmable equipment to execute the processes may be stored in
      any storage device, such as, for example, a computer system
      (non-volatile) memory, an optical disk, magnetic tape, or magnetic
      disk. Furthermore, some of the processes may be programmed when
      the computer system is manufactured or via a computer-readable
      memory medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] While this disclosure contains many specifics, these should
      not be construed as limitations on the scope of the disclosure or
      of what may be claimed, but rather as descriptions of features
      specific to particular implementations of the disclosure. Certain
      features that are described in this disclosure in the context of
      separate implementations can also be provided in combination in a
      single implementation. Conversely, various features that are
      described in the context of a single implementation can also be
      provided in multiple implementations separately or in any suitable
      subcombination. Moreover, although features may be described above
      as acting in certain combinations and even initially claimed as
      such, one or more features from a claimed combination can in some
      cases be excised from the combination, and the claimed combination
      may be directed to a subcombination or variation of a
      subcombination.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Similarly, while operations are depicted in the drawings in
      a particular order, this should not be understood as requiring
      that such operations be performed in the particular order shown or
      in sequential order, or that all illustrated operations be
      performed, to achieve desirable results. In certain circumstances,
      multitasking and parallel processing may be advantageous.
      Moreover, the separation of various system components in the
      implementations described above should not be understood as
      requiring such separation in all implementations, and it should be
      understood that the described components and systems can generally
      be integrated together in a single product.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The aspects, embodiments, features, and examples of the
      disclosure are to be considered illustrative in all respects and
      are not intended to limit the disclosure, the scope of which is
      defined only by the claims. Other embodiments, modifications, and
      usages will be apparent to those skilled in the art without
      departing from the spirit and scope of the claimed invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing lengths,
      widths, depths, or other dimensions and so forth used in the
      specification and claims are to be understood in all instances as
      indicating both the exact values as shown and as being modified by
      the term “about.” As used herein, the term “about” refers to a
      ±20% variation from the nominal value. Accordingly, unless
      indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in
      the specification and attached claims are approximations that may
      vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained.
      At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application
      of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each
      numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the
      number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary
      rounding techniques. Any specific value may vary by 20%.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The invention may be embodied in other specific forms
      without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics
      thereof. The foregoing embodiments are therefore to be considered
      in all respects illustrative rather than limiting on the invention
      described herein. Scope of the invention is thus indicated by the
      appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all
      changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of
      the claims are intended to be embraced therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that
      various modifications and changes may be made without departing
      from the scope of the described technology. Such modifications and
      changes are intended to fall within the scope of the embodiments
      that are described. It will also be appreciated by those of skill
      in the art that features included in one embodiment are
      interchangeable with other embodiments; and that one or more
      features from a depicted embodiment can be included with other
      depicted embodiments in any combination. For example, any of the
      various components described herein and/or depicted in the figures
      may be combined, interchanged, or excluded from other embodiments.<br>
