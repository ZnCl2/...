      <p>THE original blueprints for a device that could have
        revolutionised the motor car have been discovered in the secret
        compartment of a tool box. <br>
        A carburettor that would allow a car to travel 200 miles on a
        gallon of fuel caused oil stocks to crash when it was announced
        by its Canadian inventor Charles Nelson Pogue in the 1930s. </p>
      <p>But the carburettor was never produced and, mysteriously, Pogue
        went overnight from impoverished inventor to the manager of a
        successful factory making oil filters for the motor industry.
        Ever since, suspicion has lingered that oil companies and car
        manufacturers colluded to bury Pogue’s invention. </p>
      <p>Now a retired Cornish mechanic has enlisted the help of the
        University of Plymouth to rebuild Pogue’s revolutionary
        carburettor, known as the Winnipeg, from blueprints he found
        hidden beneath a sheet of plywood in the box. </p>
      <p>The controversial plans once caused panic among oil companies
        and rocked the Toronto Stock Exchange when tests carried out on
        the carburettor in the 1930s proved that it worked. </p>
      <p>Patrick Davies, 72, from St Austell, had owned the tool box for
        40 years but only recently decided to clean it out. As well as
        drawings of the carburettor, the envelope contained two pages of
        plans, three test reports and six pages of notes written by
        Pogue. </p>
      <p>They included a report of a test that Pogue had done on his
        lawnmower, which showed that he had managed to make the engine
        run for seven days on a quart (just under a litre) of petrol. </p>
      <p>The documents also described how the machine worked by turning
        petrol into a vapour before it entered the cylinder chamber,
        reducing the amount of fuel needed for combustion. </p>
      <p>Mr Davies has had the patent number on the plans authenticated,
        proving that they are genuine documents. </p>
      <p>He said: "I couldn’t believe what I saw. I used to be a motor
        mechanic and I knew this was something else altogether. I was
        given the tool box by a friend after I helped to paint her house
        in 1964. Her husband had spent a lot of time in Canada." </p>
      <p>The announcement of Pogue’s invention caused enormous
        excitement in the American motor industry in 1933, when he drove
        200 miles on one gallon of fuel in a Ford V8. However, the
        Winnipeg was never manufactured commercially and after 1936 it
        disappeared altogether amid allegations of a political cover-up.
      </p>
      <p>Dr Murray Bell, of the University of Plymouth’s department of
        mechanical and marine engineering, said he would consider trying
        to build a model of the Pogue carburetor. </p>
      <p>Engineers who have tried in the past to build a carburetor
        using Pogue’s theories have found the results less than
        satisfactory. Charles Friend, of Canada’s National Research
        Council, told <i>Marketplace</i>, a consumer affairs programme:
        "You can get fantastic mileage if you’re prepared to de-rate the
        vehicle to a point where, for example, it might take you ten
        minutes to accelerate from 0 to 30 miles an hour." </p>

      <p>This invention relates to improvements in carburetors, and the
        general objects of the invention are to economically produce a
        dry properly proportioned combustible mixture from a liquid
        fuel, and generally to improve and simplify the means for doing
        same. </p>
      <p>More particular objects of the invention are to provide a
        positive feed of the liquid fuel, and the vaporization of the
        same after atomization, and further to provide for the
        preliminary heating of the combustible mixture. </p>
      <p>In its construction, the invention includes means for
        maintaining the supply of liquid fuel, and atomizing the same,
        means for positively feeding the fuel by both pumping means and
        a compressed air injector, and means for heating the vaporizing
        chamber from the exhaust gases of an engine, and means for
        effecting mixture of gases and vapors in the vaporizing chamber,
        all constructed and arranged as described in detail in the
        accompanying specification and drawings. </p>
      <p>In the drawings: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> is a sectional elevation of an embodiment of
        the invention. </p>

        <p><img src="1750c.jpg" height="341" width="467"></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the drawings, like characters of reference indicate
        corresponding parts in all the figures. </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings, A indicates the casing of suitable
        shape to provide for the various ports and passages, and to
        contain certain of the working parts. </p>
      <p>B indicates the liquid tank designed to contain gasoline,
        kerosene, crude oil, or other liquid fuel, to be vaporized, and
        conveniently formed as an extension at one side of the casing A.
      </p>
      <p>The required fuel may be supplied through a conduit 10 to an
        inlet port 11, controlled by a needle valve 12 on a rod 13,
        pivoted to the pin 14, on the tank B, the opposite extremity of
        which is connected to a float 15, by which a determined level of
        liquid is maintained in the tank B. For convenience in moving
        the float in the event of the valve sinking, or for other
        purposes, I provide a reciprocal plunger 16 in the top of the
        casing and a knurled head 18 on the rod 16, the upward movement
        of the rod being limited by a pin 19, which engages the
        underside of the casing. </p>
      <p>A certain proportion of the liquid fuel in the chamber B is fed
        to the bottom of the casing A by means of a conduit 19a, which
        may at one point have a screen 20 therein, opposite the drain
        plug 21. </p>
      <p>The liquid fuel which accumulates in the bottom of the casing A
        is adapted to be positively raised therefrom by pumping means,
        which I have illustrated, comprises a reciprocal plunger C,
        mounted in a cylinder D, and actuated by a cam 22 on a cross
        shaft 23, which may be driven in any convenient way as from the
        pulley 24. </p>
      <p>The strap 25 surrounds the cam and is conected to the plunger C
        by a link 26. A port 27 in the side of the casing D permits the
        liquid fuel to float into the same, and on the downward movement
        of the plunger C, it is propelled through distributing pipes or
        nozzles 28, into the portion of the interior of the casing A,
        above the liquid level at the bottom thereof. </p>
      <p>A plurality of distributing nozzles 28 are provided, arranged
        at a slight inclination to the vertical, and communicating
        through a port 29 at the bottom of the cylinder D. These nozzles
        28 are tubular in form and provided on the outer side with
        discharge ports 30, having on the outside inclined deflecting
        plates 31, directed upwardly, whereby the discharged liquid fuel
        will be directed upwardly into a part of the casing A, which
        constitutes a vaporizing chamber E. </p>
      <p>Conveniently the bottom of each of the nozzles 28 is provided
        with a screen 32 opposite a drainage plug 33, and a check valve
        32a, the check valve preventing any condensate returning to the
        cylinder D. </p>
      <p>The liquid fuel discharged from the nozzles 28 is designed to
        be atomized and to facilitate this, provision is made for the
        discharge of suitable quantities of air adjacent to the point
        where the fuel is discharged from the nozzles 28. The means I
        show for this purpose, comprise air discharge discharge nozzles
        34, of tubular form designed to discharge adjacent to the upper
        ends of the nozzles 28, the lower extremities of the nozzles 28,
        the lower extremities of the nozzles 34 communicating with an
        air manifold 35, which communicates with an air supply either
        under atmospheric pressure, the air will be drawn in by the
        suction of the engine. </p>
      <p>Means are also provided to provide a further supply of fuel and
        air in the upper part of the vaporizing chamber E. These means
        include an injector device F, having an interior air nozzle 36,
        connected to a supply of compressed air, and an outer fuel
        conduit 37, the lower extrmeity of which extends beneath the
        surface of the liquid fuel in the tank B. </p>
      <p>The upper extremity of the conduit 37 is connected to a
        discharge nozzle 38 discharging near the top and at the center
        of the vaporizing chamber E. </p>
      <p>To further provide for mixing of the fuel and the air in the
        upper part of the vaporizing chamber, a mixing screen G is
        provided conveniently of conical form, and supported on the
        interior side walls of the chamber E. </p>
      <p>An outlet port 39 is provided in the top of the vaporizing
        conduit 40, from which connections to the cylinder of the
        engine, in which the combustible fuel is to be used, may be
        made. This conduit is preferable provided with a backfiring
        screen 41, and a vapor control valve 42. </p>
      <p>If it is desired to introduce water vapor into the combustible
        mixture, it may be done through a pipe 43 connecting the side of
        the conduit 40. </p>
      <p>For many instances, it will be desirable to preheat the
        combustible mixture while in the vaporizing chamber E. For this
        purpose, I surround the casing E with a heating chamber H,
        through which the supply of hot gases conveniently obtained from
        the exhaust of the engine is desired to pass. These hot gases
        being introduced through a port 44 at one side and out a conduit
        45 at the opposite side, which matter may be conveniently led to
        the muffler when the deivce is used on an automobile. </p>
      <p>To provide for proper circulation of the heating gases, a
        spiral baffle 46 may be arranged within the chamber H. </p>
      <p>It will also be found convenient to regulate the quantity of
        hot gases supplied by a thermostat I, of any convenient form and
        connected to the conduit 47, which supplies the gases to the
        port 40. </p>
      <p>In many instances, it is desired to provide for additional
        quantitites of air in the upper part of the vaporizing chamber
        E. For this purpose I provide an auxiliary air conduit 48,
        opening into the chamber E near the top thereof, and controlled
        by a butterfly valve 49. </p>
      <p>As a further means to prevent backfiring, I may provide a valve
        50 in the conduit 40, adapted to be spring-held in closed
        position, but designed to be opened by the suction of the
        engine. </p>
      <p>In the operation of the device, the pump C is positively
        operated by a turning of the shaft 23. This continuously
        discharges fuel from the nozzle 28, which is atomized by the air
        passing through the nozzles 34, the engine producing a suction
        upon the chamber E in the usual way. The chamber E being of
        relatively large size, temporarily maintains the combustible
        mixture in suspension in order to enable the vapors of the same
        to be complete. </p>
      <p>As the gases or air rises to the top of the chamber, it meets
        further quantities of gas and air introduced through the conduit
        38, and coming against the mixing screen C, is thoroughly
        admixed before passing out of the chamber. The heating gases
        passing through the chamber A, will also serve to complete the
        vaporization and form the proper proportion of dry combustible
        mixture. </p>
      <p>As many changes could be made in the above construction, and
        many apparently widley different construction, and many
        apparently widely different embodiments of my invention, within
        the scope of the claims, constructed without departing from the
        spirit or scope thereof, it is intended that all matter
        contained in the accompanying specification and drawings shall
        be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. </p>
      <p>What I claim as my invention is: [Claims not included here]. </p>

          <b><font size="+1">Carburetor</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>Charles N. Pogue</b> <br>
          (April 9, 1935)</p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to a device for obtaining intimate
        contact between a liquid in a truly vaporous state and a gas,
        and particularly to such a device which may serve as a
        carburetor for internal combustion engines, and is an
        improvement on the form of device shown in my Patent #
        1,938,497, granted December 5, 1933. </p>
      <p>In carburetors as commonly used for supplying a combustible
        mixture of air and liquid fuel to internal combustion engines a
        relatively large amount of the atomized liquid fuel is not
        vaporized and enters the engine cylinder more or less in the
        form of microscopic droplets. When such a charge is "fired" in
        the engine cylinder only that portion of the liquid fuel which
        has been converted into the vaporous and consequently the
        molecular state, combines with the air to give an explosive
        mixture. The remaining portion of the liquid fuel which is drawn
        into the engine cylinder and remains in the form of small
        droplets does not explode and thereby impart power to the
        engine, but burns with a flame and raises the temperature of the
        engine above that at which the engine operates most efficiently,
        i.e., from 160° to 180° F. </p>
      <p>In my aforesaid patent there is shown and described a form of
        carburetor in which the liquid fuel is substatially completely
        vaporized prior to its introduction into the engine cylinders,
        and in which means are provided for maintaining a reserve supply
        of "dry" vapors available for introduction into the engine
        cylinder. Such a carburetor has been found superior to the
        standard type of carburetor referred to above and to give better
        engine performance with far less consumption of fuel. </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a
        carburetor in which the liquid fuel is broken up and prepared in
        advance of and independent of the suction of the engine and in
        which a reserve supply of dry vapors will be maintained under
        pressure ready for introduction into the engine cylinder at all
        times. It is also an object of the invention to provide a
        carburetor in which the dry vapors are heated to a sufficient
        extent prior to being mixed with the main supply of air which
        carries them into the engine cylinder to cause them to expand so
        that they will be relatively lighter and will become more
        intimately mixed with the air prior to their explosion in the
        engine cylinders. </p>
      <p>I have found that when the reserve supply of dry vapors is
        heated and expanded prior to being admixed with the atmospheric
        air a greater proportion of the potential energy of the fuel is
        obtained and the mixture of air and fuel vapors will explode in
        the engine cylinders without any apparent burning of the fuel
        which would result in unduly raising the operating temperature
        of the engine. </p>
      <p>More particularly, the present invention comprises a carburetor
        in which liquid fuel vapors are passed from a main vaporizing
        chamber under at least a slight pressure into and through a
        heated chamber where they are caused to expand and in which
        droplets of liquid fuel are either vaporized or separated from
        the vapors, so that the fuel finally introduced into the engine
        cylinders is in true vapor phase. The chamber in which the
        liquid fuel vapors are heated and caused to expand preferably
        comprises a series of passages through which the vapors and the
        exhaust gases from the engine pass in tortuous paths and in such
        manner that the exhaust gases are brought into heat interchange
        relation with the vapors and give up a part of their heat to the
        vapors to cause their heating and expansion. </p>
      <p>The invention will be further described in connection with the
        accompanying drawings, but this further disclosure and
        description is to be taken merely as an exemplification of the
        invention, and the same is not limited thereby, except as is
        pointed out in the appended claims. </p>

      <p>Referring now to the drawing, the numeral 1 indicates a main
        vaporizing and atomizing chamber for the liquid fuel located at
        the bottom and communicating with a vapor heating and expanding
        chamber 2. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The vaporizing chamber is provided with a perforated
        false bottom 3 and is normally filled with liquid fuel to the
        level x. Atmospheric air from&nbsp; a conduit 4 enters the space
        below the false bottom 3 and passes upwardly through
        perforations 5 in said bottom and then bubbles up through the
        liquid fuel vaporizing a portion of it. </p>
      <p>Liquid fuel for maintaining the level x in the chamber 1 passes
        from the usual fuel tank (not shown) through a pipe 6, and is
        forced by a pump 7 through a pipe 8, into and through a pair of
        nozzles 9 having their outlets located in the chamber 1, just
        above the level of the liquid fuel therein. The pump 7 may be of
        any approved form but is preferably of the diaphragm type, as
        such fuel pumps are now standard equipment on most automobiles.
      </p>
      <p>The nozzles 9 are externally threaded at their lower ends to
        facilitate their assembly in the chamber 1 and to permit them to
        be removed readily, should cleaning be necesary. </p>
      <p>The upper ends of the nozzles 9 are surrounded by Venturi tubes
        10 having a baffle 11 located at their upper ends opposite the
        outlets of the nozzles. The liquid fuel being forced from the
        ends of the nozzles 9 into the restricted portions of the
        Vneturi tubes causes a rapid circulation of the air and vapors
        in the chamber through the tubes 10 and brings the air and
        vapors into intimate contact with the liquid fuel, with the
        result that a portion of the liquid fuel strikes the baffles 11
        and are thereby further broken up and deflected downwardly into
        the upwardly flowing currnet of air and vapors. </p>
      <p>The pump 7 is regulated to supply a greater amount of liquid
        fuel to the nozzles 9 than will be&nbsp; vaporized. The excess
        over that vaporized will drop into the chamber 1 and cause the
        liquid to be maintained at the indicated level. When the liquid
        fuel rises above that level, a float valve 12 will be lifted and
        the excess will flow through an overflow pipe 13 into a pipe 14
        leading back to the pipe 6 on the intake side of the pump 7.
        Such an arrangement permits a large amount of liquid fuel being
        withdrawn from the fuel tank than is actually vaporized and
        consumed in the engine. As the float valve 12 will set upon the
        end of the outlet pipe 13 as the liquid level drops below the
        indicated level, there is no danger of vapors passing into the
        pipe 14 and hence into the pump 7 to interfere with its normal
        operation. </p>
      <p>The upper end of the vaporizing and atomizing chamber 1 is open
        and vapors formed by the atmospheric air bubbling through the
        liquid fuel a the bottom of the chamber and those formed as the
        result of the atomization of the nozzles 9 will pass into the
        heating and expanding chamber 2. As is clearly shown in Figure
        1, the chamber 2 comprises a series of tortuous passages 15 and
        16 leading from the bottom to the top. The vapors pass through
        the passages 15 and the hot exhaust gases of the engine pass
        through the passages 16, a suitable entrance 17 and 18 being
        provided for that purpose. </p>
      <p>The vapors passing upwardly in a zigzag path through the
        passages 15 will be brought into heat interchange relation with
        the hot walls of the passages 16 for the exhaust gases. The
        total length of the pasages 15 and 16 is such that a relatively
        large reserve supply of the liquid fuel is always maintained in
        the chamber 2, and by maintaining the vapors in heat interchange
        relation with the hot exhaust gases for a substantial period,
        the vapors will absorb sufficient heat from those gases to cause
        the vapors to expand, with the result that when they are
        withdrawn from the top of the chamber 2, they will be in the
        true vapor phase, and, due to their expansion, relatively light.
      </p>
      <p>Any minute droplets of liquid fuel entrained by the vapors in
        the chamber 1 will precipitate out in the lower passages 15 and
        flow back into the chamber 1, or else be vaporized by heat which
        the vapors absorb from the hot exhaust gases in their passage
        through the chamber 2. </p>
      <p>The upper end of the vapor passage 15 communicates with
        openings 18 adjacent the upper end of a down-draft air tube 20
        leading to the intake manifold of the engine. Valves 21 are
        interposed in the openings 19, so that the passage of the vapors
        therethrough into the air tube may be controlled. The valves 11
        preferably are of the rotary plug type and are controlled as
        hereinafter described. </p>
      <p>Suitable means are provided for causing the vapors to be
        maintained in the chamber 2 under a pressure greater than
        atmospheric so that when the valves 21 are opened, the vapors
        will be forced into the air tube 20 independently of the suction
        of the engine. Such means may comprise an air pump (not shown)
        for forcing the atmospheric air through the pipe 4 into the
        chamber 1, beneath the false bottom 3, but I prefer merely to
        provide the pipe 4 with a funnel-shaped inlet end 22 and located
        just back of the usual fan 23 of the engine. That will cause the
        air to pass through the pipe 4 with sufficient force to maintain
        the desired pressure in the chamber 2, and the air being drawn
        through the radiator by the fan will be preheated prior to its
        introduction into the chamber 1 and hence will vaporize greater
        amounts of the liquid fuel. If desired, the pipe 4 may be
        surrounded by an electric or other heater, or exhaust gases from
        the engine may be passed therethrough prior to its introduction
        into the liquid fuel in the bottom of the chamber 1. The air
        tube 23 is provided with a butterfly throttle valve 24 and a
        choke valve 24a, as is customary with carburetors, used for
        internal combustion engines. The upper end of the air tube 20
        extends above the chamber 2 a distance sufficient to receive an
        air filter and /or silencer, if desired. </p>
      <p>A low speed or idling jet 25 has its upper end communicating
        with the passage through the air tube 20 adjacent the
        throtttling valve 24 and its lower end extending into the liquid
        fuel in the bottom of chamber 1 for supplying fuel to the engine
        when the valves are in a position such as to close the passages
        19. However, the passage through the idling jet 25 is so small
        that under normal operation the suction thereon is not
        sufficient to lift liquid from the bottom of the chamber 1. </p>
      <p>To prevent the engine from backfiring into the vapor chamber 2,
        the ends of the passages 15 are covered with a fine mesh screen
        26 which, operating on the principle of a miner's lamp, will
        prevent the vapors in the chamber 2&nbsp; from exploding in case
        of a backfire, but will not interfere subtantially with the
        passage of the vapors from the chamber 2 into the air tube 20
        when the valves 21 are in open position . The air tube 20
        preferably is in the form of a venturi with the&nbsp; greatest
        restriction being at that point where the openings 18 are
        located, so that when the valves 21 are opened there will be a
        pulling force on the vapors because of the increased velocity of
        the air at the restricted portion of the air tube 20 opposite
        the openings 19, as well as an expelling force on them due to
        the presence in the chamber 2. </p>
      <p>As shown in Figure 3, the operating mechanism for the valves 21
        is so connected to the operationg mechanism for the throttle
        valve 24 that they are opened and closed simultaneously with the
        opening and closing of the throttle valve, so that the amount of
        vapor supplied to the engine will at all times be in proportion
        to the demands placed upon the engine. To that end, each valve
        21 has an extension or operating stem 27 protruding through one
        of the side walls of the vapor-heating and expanding chamber 2.
        Packing glands 28 of the ordinary construction surround the
        stems 27 where they pass through the chamber wall to prevent
        leakage of vapors at those points. </p>
      <p>Operating arms 29 are rigidly secured to the outer ends of the
        stems 27 and extend towards each other. The arms are pivotally
        and adjustably connected to a pair of links 30 which at their
        lower ends are pivotally connected to an arm 32 rigidly secured
        on an outer extension 33 of the stem of the throttle valve 24.
        The extension 33 also has rigidly secured thereto an arm 34, to
        which is connected an operating link 35 leading from the means
        for accelerating the engine. </p>
      <p>The means for adjustably connecting the upper ends of the links
        30 to the valve stems 27 of the valves 21, so that the amount of
        vapors delivered from the chamber 2 may be regulated to cause
        the most efficient operation of the particular engine to which
        the carburetor is attached, comprises angular slides 36 to which
        the upper ends of the links 30 are fastened, and which are
        slidably, but non-rotatably mounted in guideways 37 in the arms
        29. The slides 26 have threaded bores through which screws 33
        pass. The screws 33 are rotatably mounted in the arms 29, but at
        held against longitudinal movement so that when they are rotated
        the slides 36 will be caused to move along the guideways 31 and
        change the relative position of the links 30 to the valve stems
        27, so that a greater or less movement, and consequently a
        greater or less opening of the ports 19 will take place when the
        throttle valve 24 is operated. </p>
      <p>For safety, and for most efficient operation of the engine, the
        vapors in the chamber 2 should not be heated or expanded beyond
        a predetermined amount, and in order to control the extent to
        which the vapors are heated, and consequently the extent to
        which they are expanded, a valve 39 is located in the exhaust
        passage 18 adjacent the inlet 11. The valve 39 is preferably
        thermostatically controlled, as, for example, by an expanding
        rod thermostat 40 which extends through the chamber 2. However,
        any other means may be provided, for reducing the amount of hot
        exhaust gases entering the passages 16 when the temperature of
        the vapors in the chamber reaches or exceeds the optimum. </p>
      <p>The carbutetor has been described in detail in connection with
        a down-draft type of carburetor, but it is to be understood that
        its usefulness is not restricted to that particular type of
        carburetor, and that the manner in which the mixture of
        atmospheric air and vapors in introduced into the engine
        cylinders is immaterial as far as the advantages of the
        carburetor are concerned. </p>
      <p>The term "dry vapor" is used herein to define the physical
        condition of the liquid fuel vapor after the removal of liquid
        droplets, or the mist which is frequently entrained in what is
        ordinarily termed a vapor. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing description it will be seen that the present
        invettion provides a carburetor in which the breaking up of the
        liquid fuel for subsequent use is independent of the suction
        created by the engine, and that after the liquid fuel is broken
        up it is maintained under pressure in a heated space for a
        length of time sufficient to permit all entrained liquid
        particles to be separated or vaporized and to permit the dry
        vapors to expand prior to their introduction into, and admixture
        with the main volume of atmospheric air passing into the engine
        cylinders,. </p>

      <p>This invention relates to carburetors suitable for use with
        internal combustion engines and in an improvement on the
        carburetors shown in my Patents # 1,938,497 and # 1,997, 497. </p>
      <p>In my aforesaid patents an intimate contact between a liquid
        such as the fuel used for internal combustion engines, and a gas
        such as air, is obtained by causing the gas to bubble up through
        a body of the liquid. The vaporized liquid passes into a vapor
        chamber which preferably is heated, and any liquid droplets are
        returned to the body of liquid, with the result that the fuel
        introduced into the combustion chamber is free of liquid
        particles, and in the molecular state so that an intimate
        mixture with the air is obtained to give an explosive mixture
        from which nearer the maximum energy is contained in the liquid
        fuel is obtained. Moreover, as there are no liquid particles
        introduced into the combustion chambers there will be no burning
        of the fuel and consequently the temperature of the engine will
        not be increased above that at which it operates most
        efficiently. </p>
      <p>In my patent # 1,997,497, the air which is to bubble up through
        the body of liquid fuel is forced into and through the fuel
        under pressure and the fuel vapors and air pass into a chamber
        where they are heated and caused to expand. The introduction of
        the air under pressure and the expansions of the vaporous
        mixture insures a sufficient pressure being maintained in the
        vapor heating and expanding chamber to cause at least a portion
        of it to be expelled therefrom into the intake manifold as soon
        as the valve controlling the passage thereto is opened. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, improved means are
        provided for maintaining the vaporous mixture in the vapor
        heating chamber under a predetermined pressure, and for
        regulating such pressure so that it will be at the optimum for
        the particular conditions under which the engine is to operate.
        Such means preferably comprises a reciprocating pump operated by
        a vacuum-operated motor for forcing the vapors into and through
        said chamber. The pump is provided with a suitable
        pressure-regulating valve so that when the pressure in the
        vapor-heating chamber exceeds the predetermined amount a portion
        of the vaporous mixture will be bypassed from the outlet side to
        the inlet side of the pump and recirculated. </p>
      <p>The invention will be described further in connection with the
        acomcpanying drawings, but such further disclosure and
        description is to be taken merely as an exemplification of the
        invention, and the same is not limited thereby except as pointed
        out in the subjoined claims. </p>

      <p>In the accompanying drawings, a vaporizing and atomizing
        chamber 1 is located at the bottom of the carburetor and has an
        outlet at its top for the passage of fuel vapors and air into a
        primary vapor heating chamber 2. </p>
      <p>The vaporizing chamber 1 is provided with a perforated false
        bottom 3 and is normally filled with liquid fuel to the level
        indicated in Figure 1. Atmospheric air from a conduit 4 is
        introduced into the space below the false bottom 3 and passes
        upwardly through the body of liquid fuel below the false bottom
        3, and then through the perforations 5 in said false bottom,
        which breaks it&nbsp; up into a myriad of fine bubbles, which
        pass upwardly through the liquid fuel above the false bottom. </p>
      <p>Liquid fuel for maintaining the level indicated in the chamber
        1 passes from the usual fuel tank (not shown) through pipe 6,
        and is forced by a pump 7 through a pipe 6 into and through a
        pair of nozzles 9 having their outlets located in the chamber 1,
        just above the level of the liquid fuel therein. The pump 7 may
        be of any approved form but is preferably of the diaphragm type,
        as such fuel pumps are now standard equipment. </p>
      <p>The nozzles 9 are externally threaded at their lower ends to
        facilitate their assembly in the chamber 1 and to permit them to
        be removed readily, should cleaning be necessary. </p>
      <p>The upper ends of the nozzles 9 are surrounded by Venturi tubes
        10 having baffles 11 located at their upper ends opposite the
        outlets of the nozzles, as is shown and described in detail in
        my aforesaid Patent # 1,997,497. The liquid fuel being forced
        from the ends of the nozzles 9 into the restricted portions of
        the tubes 10 causes a rapid circulation of the air and vapors in
        the chamber through the tubes 10 and brings the air and vapors
        into intimate contact with the liquid fuel, with the result that
        a portion thereof is vaporized. Unvaporised portions of the
        liquid fuel strike the baffles 11 and are thereby further broken
        up and deflected downwardly into the upwardly flowing current of
        air and vapors. </p>
      <p>The pump 7 is regulated to supply a greater amount of liquid
        fuel to the nozzles 9 than will be vaporized. The excess over
        that vaporized will drop into the chamber 1 and cause the liquid
        to be maintained at the indicated level. when the liquid fuel
        rises above that flat level, a float valve 12 will be lifted and
        the excess will flow through an overflow pipe 13 into a pipe 14
        leading back to the pipe 6 on the intake side of the pump 7.
        Such an arrangement permits a large amount of liquid fuel to be
        circulated by the pump 7 without more fuel being withdrawn from
        the fuel tank than is actually vaporized and consumed in the
        engine. As the float valve 12 will set upon the end of the
        outlet pipe 19 as soon as the liquid level drops below the
        indicated level, there is no danger of vapors passing into the
        pipe 14 and hence into the pump 7 to interfere with its normal
        operation. </p>
      <p>The amount of liquid fuel vaporized by the nozzles 9 and by the
        passage of air through the liquid body thereof is sufficient to
        provide a suitably enriched vaporous mixture for introducing
        into the passage leading to the intake manifold of the engine
        through which the main volume of atmospheric air passes. </p>
      <p>Vapors formed by the atmospheric air bubbling through the
        liquid fuel in the bottom of the chamber 1 and those formed as
        the result of the atomization at the nozzles 9 pass from the top
        of that chamber into the primary heating chamber 2. As is
        clearly shown in Figure 1, the chamber 2 comprises a relatively
        long spiral passage 15 through which the vaporous mixture
        gradually passes inwardly to a central outlet 16 to which is
        connected a conduit 17 leading to a reciprocating pump 18 which
        forces the vaporous mixture under pressure into a conduit 19
        leading to a central inlet 20 of a secondary heating chamber 21
        which like the primary heating chamber comprises a relatively
        long spiral. The vaporous mixture gradually passes outwardly
        through the spiral chamber 21 and enters a downdraft air tube
        22, leading to the intake manifold of the engine, through an
        outlet 23 controlled by a rotary plug valve 24. </p>
      <p>To prevent the engine from backfiring into the vapor chamber 2,
        the ends of the passages 19 are covered with a fine mesh screen
        25, which, operating on the principle of a miner's lamp, will
        prevent the vapors in the chamber 2 from exploding in case of a
        backfire, but will not interfere substantially with the passage
        of the vapors from the chamber 21 into the air tube 22 when the
        valve 24 is in open position. The air tube 22 preferably is in
        the form of a venturi with the greatest restriction being at
        that point where the outlet 23 is located, so that when the
        valve 34 is opened there will be a pulling force on the vaporous
        mixture due to the increased velocity of the air at the
        restricted portion of the air tube opposite the outlet 23, as
        well as an expelling force on them due to the pressure
        maintained in the chamber 21 by the pump 18. </p>
      <p>Both the primary and secondary spiral heating chambers 15 and
        21 and the central portion of the air tube 22 are enclosed by a
        casing 26 having an inlet 27 and an outlet 28 for a suitable
        heating&nbsp; medium such as the gaseous products of cumbustion
        from the exhaust manifold. </p>
      <p>The pump 18 for forcing the vaporous mixture from the primary
        heating chamber 2 into and through the secondary chamber 21
        includes a working chamber 29 for a hollow piston 30 provided
        with an inlet 31 contolled by a valve 32, and an outlet 33
        controlled by a valve 34. The end of the working chamber 29 to
        which is connected the conduit 17, which conducts the vaporous
        mixture from the primary heating chamber 2, has an inlet valve
        35, and the opposite end of the working chamber has an outlet 36
        controlled by a valve 37 positioned in an auxiliary chamber 38,
        to which is connected the outlet pipe 19 which conducts the
        vaporous mixture under pressure to the secondary heating chamber
        21. Each of the valves 32, 34, 35 and 37 is of the one-way type.
        They are shown as being gravity-actuated flap valves, but it
        will be understood that spring-pressured or other types of
        one-way valves may be used if desired. </p>
      <p>One side of the piston 30 is formed with a gear rack 39 which
        is received in a groove 39a of the wall forming the cylinder of
        the pump. The gear rack 39 engages with an actuating spur grear
        40 carried on one end of the shaft 41 and operating in a housing
        32 formed on the pump cylinder. The other end of the shaft 41
        carries a spur gear 43, which engages and is operated by a gear
        rack 44 carried on a piston 46 of a double-acting motor 47. The
        particular construction of the double-acting motor 47 is not
        material, and it may be of a vacuum type commonly used on
        automobiles, in which case a flexible hose 49 would be connected
        with the intake manifold of the engine to provide the encessary
        vacuum for operating the piston 45. </p>
      <p>Under the influence of the double-acting motor 47, the piston
        30 of the pump has a reciprocatory movement in the working
        chamber 29. Movement of the piston towards the left in Figure 7
        tends to compress the vaporous mixture in the working chamber
        between the end of the piston and the inlet from the pipe 17,
        and causes the valve 35 to be forced tightly against the inlet
        opening. In a like manner, the valves 32 and 24 are forced open
        and vaporous mixture in that portion of the working chamber is
        forced theough the inlet 31 in the end of the piston 30, into
        the interior of the piston, where it displaces the vaporous
        mixture there and forces it into the space between the
        right-hand end of the piston and the right-hand end of the
        working chamber. The passage of the vaporous mixture into the
        right-hand end of the working chamber is supplemented by the
        partial vacuum created there when the piston moves toward the
        left. During such movement of the piston, the valve 37 is
        maintained closed and prevents any sucking back of the vaporous
        mixture from the secondary heating chamber 21. </p>
      <p>When the motor 47 reverses, the piston 30 moves to the right
        and the vaporous mixture in the right-hand end of the working
        chamber is forced past the valve 37 and through the pipe 18 into
        the secondary heating chamber 21. At the same time, a vacuum is
        created behind the piston 30 and results in the left-hand end of
        the working chamber again being filled with the vaporous mixture
        from the primary heating chamber 2. </p>
      <p>As the operation of the pump 47 will vary in accordance with
        the suction created in the intake manifold, it preferably is
        regulated to actuate the pump at such a speed that the vaporous
        mixture will always be pumped into the secondary heating chamber
        at a rate sufficient to maintain a greater pressure there than
        is desired. In order that the pressure in the working chamber
        may at all times be maintained at the optimum, a pipe 50 having
        an adjustable pressure-regulating valve 51 is connected across
        the inlet and outlet pipes 17 and 19. The valve 51 will permit a
        portion of the vaporous mixture discharged from the pump to be
        bypassed to the inlet 17 so that a pressure, predetermined by
        the seating of the valve 51, will at all times be maintained in
        the second heating chamber 21. </p>
      <p>The air tube 22 is provided with a butterfly throttle valve 52
        and a choke valve 53, as is usual with carburetors adapted for
        use with internal combustion engines. Operating stems 54, 55, 56
        for the valves 52, 53, and 24 respectively, extend through the
        casing 26. An operating arm 57 is fixed securely to the outer
        end of the stem, 54 and is connected to a rod 55 which extends
        to the dashboard of the automobile or some other place
        conveniently located to the driver of the automobile. The outer
        end of the stem 56 of the valve 24 which controls the outlet 23
        from the secondary heating chamber 21 has one end of an
        operating arm 59 fixedly secured thereto. The other end of the
        arm 59 is pivotally connected to a link 60 which extends
        downwardly and pivotally connects to one end of a bell crank
        lever 61, fixedly secured to the end of the stem 54 of the
        throttle valve 52. The other end of the bell crank lever 61 is
        connected to an operating rod 62 which, like the rod 53, extends
        to a place conveniently located to the driver. The valves 24 and
        52 are connected for simultaneous operation so that when the
        throttle valve 52 is opened to increase the speed of the engine
        the valve 24 will be opened to admit a larger amount of the
        heated vaporous mixture from the secondary heating chamber 21. </p>
      <p>While the suction created by the pump ordinarily will create a
        sufficient vacuum in the primary heating chamber 2, to cause
        atmospheric air to be drawn into and upwardly through the body
        of liquid fuel in the bottom of the vaporizing chamber 1, in
        some instances it may be desirable to provide supplemental means
        for forcing the atmospheric air into and through said body of
        liquid and in such case an auxiliary pump may be provided for
        that purpose, or the air conduit may be provided with a
        funnel-shaped intake which is positioned behind the fan which is
        customarily placed behind the radiator of the engine. </p>
      <p>The foregoing description has been given in connection with a
        downdraft type of carburetor, but it is to be understood that
        the invention is not limited to use with such type carburetors
        and that the manner in which the mixture of atmospheric air and
        vapors is introduced into the engine cylinders is immaterial as
        far as the advantages of the carburetor are concerned. </p>
      <p>Before the carburetor is put into use the pressure-regulating
        valve 51 in the bypass pipe 58 will be adjusted so that the
        pressure best suited for conditions under which the engine is to
        operate will be maintained in the secondary heating chamber 21.
        When the valve 51 has thus been set and the engine started, the
        pump will create a partial vacuum in the primary heating chamber
        2 and cause atmospheric air to be drawn through the conduit 4
        and to bubble upwardly through the liquid in the bottom of the
        vaporizing and atomizing chamber 1 with resultant vaporization
        of a part of the liquid fuel therein. At the same time, the pump
        will be set into operation and liquid fuel will be pumped from
        the fuel tank through the nozzles 9 which will result in an
        additional amount of the fuel being vaporized. The vapors
        resulting from such atomization of the liquid fuel and the
        passage of the air through the body of the liquid will pass into
        and through the spiral chamber 1 where they will be heated by
        the products of combustion in the surrounding chamber formed by
        the casing 26. The fuel vapors and air will gradually pass
        inwardly to the outlet 16 and thence through the conduit 17 to
        the pump 18 which will force them into the secondary heating
        chamber 21 in which they will be maintained at the predetermined
        pressure by the pressure-regulating valve 51. The vaporous
        mixture is further heated in the chamber 21 and passes spirally
        outwardly to the valve-controlled outlet 23 which opens into the
        air tube 22 which conducts the main volume of atmospheric air to
        the intake manifold of the engine. </p>
      <p>The heating of the vaporous mixture in the heating chambers 2
        and 21 tends to cause them to expand, but expansion in the
        chamber 21 is prevented due to the pressure maintained in that
        chamber by the regulating valve 51. However, as soon as the
        heated vaporous mixture passes the valve 24 and is introduced
        into the air flowing through the intake tube 22, it is free to
        expand and thereby become relatively light so that a more
        intimate mixture with the air is obtained prior to the mixture
        being exploded in the engine cylinders. Thus it will be seen
        that the present invention not only provides means wherein the
        vaporous mixture from the heating chamber 21 is forced into the
        air passing through the air tube 22 by a positive force, but is
        is also heated to such an extent that after it leaves the
        chamber 21 it will expand to such an extent as to have a density
        less than it would if introduced directly from the vaporizing
        and atomizing chamber 1 into the air tube 22. </p>
      <p>The majority of the liquid particles entrained by the vaporous
        mixture leaving the chamber 1 will be separated in the first
        half of the outermost spiral of the primary heating chamber 2
        and drained back into the body of liquid in the tank. Any liquid
        particles which are not thus separated will be carried on with
        the vaporous mixture and due to the circulation of that mixture
        and the application of heat, will be vaporized before the
        vaporous mixture is introduced into the air tube 22 from the
        secondary heating chamber 21. Thus "dry" vapors only are
        introduced into the engine cylinders and any burning of liquid
        particles of the fuel in the engine cylinder, which would tend
        to raise the temperature of the engine above that at which it
        operates most efficiently is avoided. </p>
      <p>While the fullest benefits of the invention are obtained by
        using both a primary and a secondary heating chamber, the
        primary heating chamber may, if desired, be eliminated, and the
        vaporous mixture pumped directly from the vaporizing and
        atomizing chamber into the spiral heating chamber 21. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing invention it will be seen that the present
        invention provides an improvement over the carburetor disclosed
        in my patent # 1,997,497, in that it is possible to maintain the
        vaporous mixture in the heating chamber 21 under a predetermined
        pressure, and that as soon as the vaporous mixture is introduced
        in the main supply of the engine, it will expand and reach a
        density at which it will form a more intimate mixture with the
        air. Furthermore, the introduction of the vaporous mixture into
        the air stream in the tube 22 causes a certain amount of
        turbulence which also tends to give a more intimate mixture of
        the vapor molecules with the air. </p>
