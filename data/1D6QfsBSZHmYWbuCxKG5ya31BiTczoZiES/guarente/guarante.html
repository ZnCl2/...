      </b><b>Why It Matters</b><br>
      <br>
      Everyone is getting older. Few are happy about it.<br>
      <br>
      An anti-aging startup hopes to elude the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration and death at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      The company, Elysium Health, says it will be turning chemicals
      that lengthen the lives of mice and worms in the laboratory into
      over-the-counter vitamin pills that people can take to combat
      aging.<br>
      <br>
      The startup is being founded by Leonard Guarente, an MIT biologist
      who is 62 (“unfortunately,” he says) and who’s convinced that the
      process of aging can be slowed by tweaking the body’s metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      The problem, Guarente says, is that it’s nearly impossible to
      prove, in any reasonable time frame, that drugs that extend the
      lifespan of animals can do the same in people; such an experiment
      could take decades. That’s why Guarente says he decided to take
      the unconventional route of packaging cutting-edge lab research as
      so-called nutraceuticals, which don’t require clinical trials or
      approval by the FDA.<br>
      <br>
      This means there’s no guarantee that Elysium’s first product, a
      blue pill called Basis that is going on sale this week, will
      actually keep you young. The product contains a chemical precursor
      to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, a compound that
      cells use to carry out metabolic reactions like releasing energy
      from glucose. The compound is believed cause some effects similar
      to a diet that is severely short on calories — a proven way to
      make a mouse live longer.<br>
      <br>
      Elysium’s approach to the anti-aging market represents a change of
      strategy for Guarente. He was previously involved with Sirtris
      Pharmaceuticals, a high-profile biotechnology startup that studied
      resveratrol, an anti-aging compound found in red wine that it
      hoped would help patients with diabetes. That company was bought
      by drug giant GlaxoSmithKline, but early trials failed to pan out.<br>
      <br>
      This time, Guarente says, the idea is to market anti-aging
      molecules as a dietary supplement and follow up with clients over
      time with surveys and post-marketing studies. Guarente is founding
      the company along with Eric Marcotulli, a former venture
      capitalist and technology executive who will be CEO, and Dan
      Alminana, chief operating officer.<br>
      <br>
      The company says it will follow strict pharmaceutical-quality
      production standards and make the supplements available solely
      through its website, for $60 for a 30-day supply or $50 per month
      with an ongoing subscription.<br>
      <br>
      “You have high-end prescription drugs up here, which are
      expensive,” says Guarente, gesturing upward. “And you have the
      nutraceuticals down there, which are a pig in a poke — you don’t
      know what you’re getting and you don’t know a lot about the
      science behind them. There’s this vast space in between that could
      be filled in a way that’s useful for health maintenance.”<br>
      <br>
      An anti-aging pill with an ivory-tower pedigree could prove
      profitable. The $30 billion supplements market is growing at about
      7 percent a year overall, Alminana says, and at twice that rate
      for online sales.<br>
      <br>
      Elysium declined to name its investors, but it has some high-level
      endorsements. Its board includes Daniel Fabricant, former director
      of the FDA’s division of dietary supplements and now CEO of the
      Natural Products Association, a trade association. The company
      also has five Nobel Prize winners advising it including
      neuroscientist Eric Kandel, biologist Thomas Südhof,
      origin-of-life theorist Jack Szostak, and the 2013 laureate in
      chemistry Martin Karplus.<br>
      <br>
      Karplus, now an emeritus professor at Harvard, said in a telephone
      interview that he was turning 85 this year and had asked the
      company to send him a supply of Basis as soon as it’s available.
      “I want to remind myself whether I really want to take it or not,”
      says Karplus.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have shown they can reliably extend the life of
      laboratory mice by feeding them less, a process known as “caloric
      restriction.” That process seems to be mediated by biological
      molecules called sirtuins. NAD is important because it’s a
      chemical that sirtuins need to do their work and is also involved
      in other aspects of a cell’s metabolism. In worms, mice, and
      people, NAD levels fall with age, says Guarente, so the idea is to
      increase levels of the molecule.<br>
      <br>
      “NAD replacement is one of the most exciting things happening in
      the biology of aging,” says Nir Barzilai, director of the
      Institute for Aging Research at the Albert Einstein College of
      Medicine in New York, who has coauthored scientific papers with
      Guarente but is not involved in Elysium. “The frustration in our
      field is that we have shown we can target aging, but the FDA does
      not [recognize it] as an indication.”<br>
      <br>
      Other experts said while NAD may decline with age, there is
      limited evidence that aging can be affected by restoring or
      increasing NAD levels. “There is enough evidence to be excited,
      but not completely compelling evidence,” said Brian K. Kennedy,
      CEO of the California-based Buck Institute for Research on Aging.<br>
      <br>
      Guarente says Elysium’s pill includes a precursor to NAD, called
      nicotinamide riboside, which the body can transform into NAD and
      put to use. In addition, the pill contains pterostilbene, an
      antioxidant that Guarente says stimulates sirtuins in a different
      way. Both ingredients can already be found in specialty
      vitamins.&nbsp; “We expect a synergistic effect [from] combining
      them,” he says. <br>
      <br>
      Guarente says Elysium plans to gradually add to its product line
      with other compounds shown in academic labs to extend the healthy
      lifespan of worms, mice, or other animals. The company will do
      preliminary testing to make sure the products are not toxic but
      will not follow the arduous FDA approval process. Vitamins and
      supplements can be sold over the counter as long as they contain
      ingredients known to be safe and don’t make overly specific health
      claims.<br>
      <br>
      Marcotulli says the company has some anecdotal evidence that
      Elysium’s pills make a difference. “For older demographics, we’ve
      heard really interesting feedback related to levels of energy.
      It’s very, very useful and restorative,” he says. And he takes the
      pills himself. “When I don’t have a supply, I feel actually
      fuzzy,” he said. “It’s become a staple of my routine.”<br>
      <br>
      Guarente also says he takes Basis every day, along with 250 mg of
      resveratrol, the red-wine compound. Guarente also exercises —
      though not, he says, as often as he should.<br>
      <br>
      He says it doesn’t trouble him that he sees no obvious benefits
      yet from his supplement regimen. Too many studies in the
      anti-aging field, he says, are too short-term to show real
      benefits. Or else they study people who are already unhealthy. “I
      think that’s the way it would be if something is really acting to
      slow your progression into decrepitude — you’re not going to
      notice that,” Guarente says.<br>

      <br>
      Over the past decade, MIT biologist Leonard Guarente ‘74 and
      others have shown that very low-calorie diets provoke a
      comprehensive physiological response that promotes survival, all
      orchestrated by a set of proteins called sirtuins.<br>
      <br>
      Now, Guarente and colleagues have shown that sirtuins are also
      likely to play a key role in the psychological response to dietary
      restriction. When sirtuins are elevated in the brain, as occurs
      when food intake is cut, serotonin levels drop in mice and the
      animals become much more anxious. Furthermore, in two large
      genetic studies of humans, the team found that mutations that
      boost production of sirtuins are commonly associated with higher
      rates of anxiety and panic disorder.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers believe this anxiety may be an evolutionary
      adaptation that makes animals—including humans—more cautious under
      the stress of having to forage more widely for scarce food.<br>
      <br>
      “It makes sense, because behavioral effects would be as adaptive,
      and as selected by evolution, as physiological effects,” says
      ­Guarente, a professor of biology. “I don’t think it’s surprising
      that behavior really falls under the umbrella of natural
      selection.”<br>
      <br>
      Guarente discovered about 20 years ago that sirtuins prolong life
      span in yeast; since then, they have been shown to have similar
      effects in worms, mice, and other animals. Normally turned on in
      response to stresses such as starvation or inflammation, the
      compounds coördinate a variety of hormonal networks, regulatory
      proteins, and genes, with a net effect of keeping cells alive and
      healthy.<br>
      <br>
      His new research, published online in Cell in December, examined
      mice with elevated levels of the SIRT1 protein in their brains and
      mice with no SIRT1. Researchers placed them on a circular raised
      platform with two quadrants protected by a wall and two
      unprotected quadrants. “Normal mice will spend a considerable
      amount of time venturing out into the unprotected region, and
      super-anxious mice tend to stay in the protected area,” Guarente
      says.<br>
      <br>
      The mice with very high sirtuin levels spent much more time closer
      to the walls, suggesting that they were more anxious. Mice lacking
      sirtuin were much more adventuresome.<br>
      <br>
      The team investigated the cellular mechanism behind this
      phenomenon. They found that sirtuins help control levels of the
      neurotransmitter serotonin, long known to be critical for mood
      regulation.<br>
      <br>
      The new research suggests that anxiety could be treated with drugs
      that inhibit sirtuins. But it also offers reason for caution when
      treating patients with drugs that activate sirtuins, several of
      which are now in clinical trials for diabetes and other metabolic
      diseases. Those drugs can’t enter the brain, but some researchers
      are exploring the possibility of using sirtuin activators to treat
      neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. If such drugs
      were developed and approved, doctors might need to watch for
      anxiety as a possible side effect.<br>
      <br>
      “We want to learn as much as we can about the biology of sirtuins,
      to inform the use of sirtuin drugs to treat diseases,” Guarente
      says. “The more we know about the biology, the better position
      we’ll be in to know how to use the drugs, how to dose them, and
      how to anticipate any possible side effects.” <br>

      The present invention provides new and advantageous methods,
      compositions, cell constructs and animal models related to
      inhibiting the senescence of vertebrate cells and vertebrate
      organisms based on the use of SIRT1 polynucleotides and
      polypeptides, as well as mutant SIRT1 polynucleotides and
      polypeptides. The invention provides polynucleotides that encode
      variants and fragments of SIRT1 polypeptides, and also provides
      variant SIRT1 polypeptides and fragments thereof. Additionally the
      invention provides a method of inhibiting or delaying the
      expression in a vertebrate cell of a protein having biological
      activity associated with loss of population doubling in the cell.
      The invention further provides a method of treating a pathology, a
      disease or a medical condition in a subject, wherein the pathology
      responds to an SIRT1 polypeptide. The invention also provides a
      vertebrate cell that incorporates a heterologous nucleic acid
      encoding a variant of SIRT1, or a fragment thereof, as well as a
      transgenic mammal a majority of whose cells harbor a transgene
      including a nucleic acid sequence encoding an SIRT1 polypeptide.
      The invention also provides an antibody that binds
      immunospecifically to a variant SIRT1 polypeptide or a fragment
      thereof, and a method of determining whether the amount of an
      SIRT1 polypeptide in a sample differs from the amount of the SIRT1
      polypeptide in a reference. The invention further provides a
      method of contributing to the diagnosis or prognosis of, or to
      developing a therapeutic strategy for, a disease or pathology in a
      subject, wherein the disease or pathology responds to treatment
      with an SIRT1 polypeptide and wherein the amount of SIRT1
      polypeptide in the pathology is known to differ from the amount of
      the SIRT1 polypeptide in a nonpathological state.<br>
