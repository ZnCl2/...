      <br>
      Weapon for remotely destructing electric materials, electronic
      circuits and configuration of e.g. computer, has anticathode to
      create hard X ray beams passing through cathode and directed to
      focal point of system to be destructed.<br>
      <br>
      The weapon has two guns (5, 6), each with a heating filament (13)
      to heat a cathode (14), supplied with very high negative voltage
      (11), for extracting electrons (15) when the weapon assembly is
      supplied with voltage. The electrons are reflected by an
      anticathode (19) to generate concentrated hard X-ray beam (16)
      that passes through the cathode and is directed towards a focal
      point of a system to be destructed. The electrons are attracted by
      an anode (20) supplied by very high positive voltage (11).<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a weapon whose device according
      to the invention allows remote destruction of all electrical
      equipment, electronic circuits and all computer configurations in
      order to render unusable the equipment for which they were
      designed.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, destruction involves all equipment and installations
      using and using such electrical equipment, electronic circuits and
      X10 computer configurations, whether stationary or mobile, land,
      air or sea, such as computers, navigation and guidance systems ,
      telecommunications, conventional or nuclear defense or attack
      weapons, aircraft, helicopters, land vehicles, missiles,
      satellites, rockets, boats, detection devices, radars,
      electricity, video systems, radio and television transmitters and
      receivers.<br>
      <br>
      This weapon, whose device allowing such destruction, can be fixed
      or mobile, that is to say it can be used from a building, a
      dwelling, a land vehicle, an airplane , a helicopter, a ship, a
      rocket, a missile, or on the back of a man. This weapon can
      therefore be used anywhere and anywhere when thanks to its
      mobility. The neutralization of the circuits and configurations
      mentioned above takes place at the speed of light.<br>
      <br>
      The range and power of this remote weapon of destruction, which is
      the subject of the invention, can be from a few meters to several
      tens of meters or hundreds of meters. The size of this weapon can
      be the size of a point weapon up to several meters. In fact, the
      size, scope and power of this weapon will be a function and will
      be defined by the specifications established for a specific
      device, for the use to be made of it and will therefore be
      essentially based on the the quality of the materials and
      components used, the energy available for its operation and to
      achieve the desired result. For example, the weapon being the
      device according to the invention, will be able, from the ground,
      from a helicopter or from a boat and by its user targeting an
      objective, an apparatus, to generate destruction of all the
      electronic circuits or embedded computing configurations and make
      this device unusable.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is a device for sending an electrical
      discharge at a distance to the speed of the light without material
      support, such as electric wires for example, in order to destroy
      remotely electronic circuits and the electronic components which
      constitute them or else still computer data. [4]<br>
      <br>
      In the current state of technology, no device can achieve such a
      result and can not produce the shutdown without any physical or
      physical link, computer configurations, electronic circuits,
      electrical equipment.<br>
      <br>
      The technical solution is provided by this weapon, which is the
      subject of the invention. To generate destruction of all circuits,
      equipment and computer, electronic or electrical configurations,
      they must be subjected to an electrical overload or discharge
      sufficient to cause the short circuits, the flashings necessary to
      render them definitively unusable.<br>
      <br>
      If a direct or direct electrical or electrical overload or
      discharge is generated remotely, in the immediate environment in
      which these apparatuses, circuits and configurations are located,
      it occurs in these same devices, circuits or configurations , the
      overload or electrical discharge sufficient and fatal, provoking
      short circuits the flashings necessary to destroy them.<br>
      <br>
      Science, calculations, tests, various experiments carried out,
      simulations and the laws of optics and physics, demonstrate
      several facts: a sufficient electrical overload or discharge
      causes, by induction, an electrical overload or discharge which is
      also fatal to the electrical or electronic circuits, as long as
      the latter are in the environment, the field and in the immediate
      immediate vicinity of the field generating the initial electrical
      overload or discharge.<br>
      <br>
      An ionized atmosphere is conductive, transports electric charges,
      and behaves like an electrical conductor; therefore, when an
      electronic circuit, computer configuration and electrical
      equipment are found to be present in such an ionized atmosphere,
      to which an overload or an electric discharge is applied, by
      induction, there is a sufficient overload or electrical discharge
      and fatal to these same circuits and configurations, generating
      the destruction of the electronic components and the computer
      data.<br>
      <br>
      X-rays have the particularity of ionizing the atmosphere they pass
      through. This ionized atmosphere allows the transport of electric
      charges as would an electrical conductor. It is therefore possible
      to apply an overload or an electric discharge of very high voltage
      from an electric generator to this atmosphere ionized by X-rays.
      The basic principle will therefore be that, for the device
      according to the invention, electrical equipment, electronic
      circuits and computer configurations by hard X-rays in order to
      locally cause an ionization of the atmosphere in which the
      circuits and materials mentioned above are located; The electrical
      overload or discharge must then be applied to the entire ionized
      atmospheric zone so that, by induction, generated in the said
      circuits, equipment, apparatus and configurations, the electrical
      overload or discharge necessary for their destruction.<br>
      <br>
      X-rays have the peculiarity, since they are emitted, that they can
      not be deflected by any means, electric, waveguide or magnetic.
      Their direction, direction and field are defined as soon as they
      are produced and their trajectory can not be modified.<br>
      <br>
      In order to allow these X-rays to have the direction, the
      direction A0 in a desired very closed angle and to be very
      concentrated in the form of beams, beams, much like a laser beam,
      allowing the production of X-rays from the outset; it is a
      question of modifying the anticathode, the AS cathode and the
      anode, in order to obtain highly concentrated hard X-rays having
      the desired shape, range and power, ie having a direction, a
      rectilinear direction very localized in the form of beams, as if
      it were a laser beam and having the least possible dispersion
      outside the chosen axis of X-ray propagation. For example , as
      soon as they are produced, the X-rays must have a diameter of
      between two centimeters and twenty centimeters, depending on the
      shape of the electrodes ZS * producing these electromagnetic waves
      and a range and power up to several hundred meters.<br>
      <br>
      This will depend on the specifications established between the
      manufacturer and the user.<br>
      <br>
      By combining at least two such hard x-ray sources of this type,
      directed in a convergent manner and in such a way as to create a
      focal point, the latter, for example, one hundred meters away, the
      whole atmospheric zone starting from the first source of
      production of X-rays to the focal point and then from the latter
      to the second source of production of X-rays will be ionized. At
      this ionized atmospheric zone subjected to X-rays, there can be
      applied an electric overload or discharge of very high voltage,
      coming from an electric source, from a few tens of thousands of
      volts to several hundreds of thousands of volts. As in an
      electrical conductor, electrical overload or discharge will extend
      over and throughout the ionized atmospheric zone from the first
      source of X-ray production to the focal point and then to the
      second source of X-ray production. If at the focal point or A0 in
      the trajectory of one of the two sources of X-ray production
      traversed by the electric discharge there is present an electronic
      circuit, a computer configuration, the latter will undergo the
      destructive electric discharge or overload created by induction by
      the initial electrical charge applied to the ionized zone.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, two hard X-ray beams converge towards a focal point
      targeting an electronic circuit or a computer configuration; the
      entire atmospheric zone traversed by hard X-rays is ionized. At
      this ionized zone, a continuous, pulsed or alternating electrical
      discharge is applied which, by induction, causes an electrical
      overload in the electronic circuit which destroys the latter.<br>

      In its practical realization, the basic principle, the weapon 2S
      of remote destruction computer configurations, the invention, is a
      device of electronic circuits, electrical equipment, according to
      the following constituted: A mechanically removable plate (1) 2)
      of articulations, horizontal (3) and directional, linked by two
      vertical (4) stabilization in order to: enable spatial orientation
      of the whole object device and according to the invention.<br>
      <br>
      On this tray (1) lies two hard X - ray guns (5 and 6) (16). Each
      of these barrels (5 and 6) is provided with a lead shield (7) to
      stop the residual X-rays. Each of these two barrels (5 and 6) is
      also equipped with a cooling radiator (8). Each bundle, lead (7)
      and radiator (8) on the one hand and barrel (6), lead (7) and
      radiator (8) by two degrees S of articulation, horizontal (9) and
      vertical (10) so as to be able to direct each beam of hard X-rays
      (16) emitted simultaneously by each of the two guns (5 and 6)
      converging towards a focal point (F). It is the set of adjustable
      joints (3), (4), (9), (10) 40 that will make it possible to
      target, designate and determine the objective to be achieved,
      corresponding to the focal point that is to say the electronic
      circuit or the computer configuration to be destroyed and housed
      in an apparatus such as an aircraft, a ship, a missile, a
      computer, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the hard X-ray generating guns (16 and 16) is independent
      of each other and are both spaced apart from a few centimeters to
      a few meters the specifications defined between the user and the
      manufacturer. The two X-ray beams (5 and 6) are produced
      identically.<br>
      <br>
      Each gun (5 and 6) is supplied by a very high voltage electric
      current source (11) from a few thousand volts to a few hundred
      thousand volts 2S in order to produce very penetrating hard X-rays
      (16) required for operation of the weapon, which is the subject of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The whole device contains a whole set of points, fastenings,
      fasteners, locks and clamps, various supports (12).<br>
      <br>
      Each of the hard X-ray generating guns (5 and 6) is constructed
      and constructed identically of the other as follows: A resistant
      and sealed glass bulb (17) in the form of cylindrical tube, in
      which a very high air gap (18) has been produced; a metal cathode
      (14) supplied with a very high negative voltage (11), and in the
      form of a ring in order to allow the hard X-rays (16) emitted in
      the form of beams or rays to pass freely through the metallic
      anticathode 19).<br>
      <br>
      The anticathode (19) has a parabolic shape so that the hard X -
      rays (16) are reflected along the axis and direction, the anode
      (20), the parabolic anticathode (19) ring and the focal point (F).<br>
      <br>
      The precise form of the parabolic anticathode (19) will be defined
      according to the laws of optics and physics and the specifications
      established between the user and the manufacturer in order to
      allow a reflection from their source of X-rays (16) in a parallel
      manner under the beam shape SIS so that they can pass through the
      center of the circular cathode (14).<br>
      <br>
      Each filament (13) of each barrel (5 and 6) is supplied with
      electric current so as to heat each cathode (14) of each barrel (5
      and 6) in order to extract the electrons (15).<br>
      <br>
      The metal anode (20) is supplied with a very high positive voltage
      (11) so as to attract the electrons (15) emitted by the cathode
      (14). The shape of the anode (20) should be cylindrical and
      narrow. [2]<br>
      <br>
      In the path of the highly penetrating hard X-rays (16) emitted by
      the anticathode (19) in the form of bundles, for each gun (5 and
      6) and at their end is fixed in the lead shield (7) a tube (23)
      made of material with a high electrical insulation coefficient. In
      each of these tubes (23) there is embedded a metal electrode (24)
      in the form of a ring. An electric current of very high voltage
      (25) or negative voltage is applied to each electrode (24) on an
      electrode (24) of one of the two tubes (23) of the barrel (5) (25)
      on the other electrode (24) of the other tube (23) of the barrel
      (6) on the other hand. The very high voltage (25) applied to the
      electrodes (24) may be continuous, pulsed or alternative, it will
      be some hundred or thousand volts according to the specifications
      established between the user and the manufacturer.<br>
      <br>
      The device as a whole, which is the subject of the invention, may
      be used with telemetric sighting instruments, radar, night vision
      or infrared vision device or automatic adjustment on the target in
      order to determine the distance of the object for obtain the focal
      point (F) in order to facilitate and increase the reliability of
      the system by these types of ancillary assistance which are not
      shown here. The device according to the invention is presented
      here in a version of use and of -45 manual adjustments and
      contains all the basic principle. However, eye goggles (22) are
      provided on each of the barrels (5 and 6) to adjust each of the
      guns on a target coincident with the focal point (F).<br>
      <br>
      All electrical parts (E) are made with electrical conductors with
      a high electrical insulation coefficient.<br>
      <br>
      When the whole device of the invention, the object of the
      invention is set to a target whose electrical, electronic or
      computer system is to be destroyed, the device is switched on. The
      filaments (13) heat the cathode (14). The electrons (15) extracted
      from the cathode (14), supplied with a very high negative voltage
      (11), are attracted by the anode (20) supplied with a very high
      positive voltage (11). The electrons (15) are reflected by the
      parabolic anticathode (19), which generates a highly concentrated
      x-ray beam (16). The hard X-rays (16) pass through the ring-shaped
      cathode (14) and each of the hard X-ray beams (16) produced by
      each of the guns (5 and 6) travels to the focal point ), ie on the
      system to be destroyed.<br>
      <br>
      The entire atmospheric zone traversed by the very penetrating hard
      X-rays (16) is found to be very highly ionized and makes it
      conductive to allow the transport of electrical charges of very
      high voltage. That is to say that S the ionized atmospheric zone
      (I) extends from the first hard X-ray source (16) produced by one
      of the two guns (5 or 6) to the focal point (F) or converging from
      the same focal point (F) to the second hard X-ray source (16)
      produced by the other barrel (5 or 6).<br>
      <br>
      Through the electrodes (24), housed respectively in each tube (23)
      and traversed by the hard X-rays (16) emitted by each barrel (5
      and 6), the ionized atmospheric zone very high voltage (25), in
      the form of an overload or a 4S electric discharge, pulsed or
      alternative. This electrical overload or discharge will leave the
      negative electrode (24) fixed at the end of the barrel (5 or 6)
      and will pass through the entire ionized atmospheric zone (I) to
      the electronic system to be destroyed, the latter coinciding with
      the focal point F) and to the other positive electrode (24) of the
      other barrel (5 or 6). The electronic or computer system located
      and confused with the focal point (F) will then undergo an
      electric shock. By induction, there will occur in this same
      electronic or computer system an overload or zS electrical
      discharge sufficient to generate its destruction.<br>
      <br>
      In each of the tubes (23), a further ring-like electrode (21) can
      also be fixed in order to apply a further energy source thereto in
      order to increase the efficiency of the whole device object of the
      invention, or for possibly carrying out different applications,
      other than those provided herein within the scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The accompanying drawings illustrate the invention: Figure 1 shows
      a cavalier perspective of the device of the invention. <br>
      <br>
      2 shows a cross-sectional view of the device of the invention;
      (3), (4), (9), (10) and the barrel (5 or 6) of the device
      according to the invention. FIG. 3 shows different views of the
      anodes (20), anticathode (19) and cathode (14) and metal
      electrodes (24) of electric discharges.<br>
      <br>
      The entire description refers to these drawings and the various
      elements constituting the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The dimensions and tensions used are not limiting with respect to
      the entire device according to the invention since it is the
      specifications set out between the manufacturer and the user which
      will have to determine the technical characteristics according to
      the invention, use of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that the device according to the invention can carry,
      transporting electric charges at a sufficiently high distance and
      at the speed of light such as is explained here, allows this
      device to have a multiple application field other than mentioned
      herein. Its main application will be the remote destruction of the
      electronic circuits and computer configurations contained in any
      civilian or military equipment.<br>
