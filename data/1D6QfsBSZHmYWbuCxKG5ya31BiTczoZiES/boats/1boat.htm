      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The "feelers" jutting out
          from this novel boat follow the ups and downs of waves and
          troughs. In turn these "jockey" skids change the angle of the
          hydrofoils to provide extra lift so that the Hydrofin boat
          rides the wave crests in rough water. The result is a
          smoother, faster ride, according to the craft's British
          inventor, Christopher Hook. The first commercial model,
          expected to be in coastal service early next year, will be 30
          feet long, and will accommodate a dozen passengers plus a crew
          of two.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cleaving the water at
          express-train speed, a propellerless powerboat of new design
          may shatter existing speed marks if it fulfills the hopes of
          its West Easton, PA, inventor. Its slim hull rides upon three
          buoyant, barrel-shaped rollers, of which the forward two are
          connected to the power plant and revolve at high speed.
          Helical fins, encircling them, sweep water astern and drive
          the boat forward. The water is also driven to each side, so
          that at high speed a trough is formed beneath the hull.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Outriggers shaped like
          airplane wings support the rollers and provide a lifting
          effect that aids the boat in skimming the surface. A freely
          rotating, fluted pontoon, that diminishes friction, supports
          the after end of the boat and a conventional rudder is used
          for steering.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Will paddle wheels for boats
          state a comeback? A Chicago inventor has designed what he
          declares to be a modernized concept of this historic form of
          marine propulsion. His plan calls for a boat that runs upon a
          pair of endless tracks, after the fashion of a land tractor,
          the tracks consisting of moving belts carrying a series of
          paddles. When power is applied to the belts through driving
          drums near the stern, they cause the paddles to sweep backward
          through the water, impelling the boat forward. At the same
          time, the planning action of the inclined paddles tends to
          lift the boat clear of the water, with the result that the
          hull skims the surface with a minimum of resistance. In
          consequence, the inventor maintains, a tractor boat of this
          type could attain high speed and could travel with a marked
          economy of fuel. The angle of inclination of the paddles would
          be suited to the weight of the craft; a heavy boat would have
          them mounted at an angle approximately 45 degrees, while a
          lighter craft, requiring less lifting force, could employ more
          steeply inclined paddles to obtain greater forward traction.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The new type of boat
          illustrated below has been specially designed for propulsion
          by a kind of turbine in reverse. The after end of the hull is
          recessed to accommodate the propeller mechanism, which is in
          two cylindrical sections, one inside the other. The inside
          division is stationary and houses the power unit, while the
          outside section, which revolves, is fitted on its exterior
          with a spiral fin or blade. When this turns, boring through
          the water like an auger, there is a long-continued thrust that
          sends the boat forward at a steady speed. Unlike the
          conventional propeller, the device makes a continuous "bite"
          at the water over a considerable distance. Forward of the
          propeller is a cabin with control apparatus. The man who
          invented the boat is Harold B. Harvey, Pensacola FL.</font> </p>

          boats will be of light wood and fabric construction, will be
          reversible according to the direction of the wind, reducing
          the necessity for tacking and avoiding the keeling over common
          to conventional sailing craft. According to the inventor, his
          sails will develop three times as much propelling force as

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Looking like whirling
          surfboards, strange new rotors will furnish the power on a
          boat now nearing completion at Chicago. Laurence J. Lesh,
          pioneer aeronautical engineer, is designer of the craft.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unlike the Flettner rotor
          ship, which attracted wide attention a few years ago, his boat
          will depend entirely upon the wind for propulsion. No engines
          will be required to keep the rotors turning, as was the case
          with the high "chimneys" of the German craft. Once the
          pointed, vertical wings of the Lesh boat being spinning, they
          keep on until the wind dies down or the brakes are applied.
          The lightest of breezes, tests have shown, will start them
          whirling and move the ship.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For more than a year, Lesh
          has been experimenting with miniature rotor ships in the model
          boat basin in Jackson Park, besides conducting various
          wind-tunnel tests. His researches have shown that the spinning
          wings of his models will pull the boat directly into the teeth
          of the wind and that they give almost four times the
          propelling power of ordinary sails. They spin equally well in
          either direction, an improvement over the S-shaped rotors of
          the Finnish inventor Savonius, which require a complicated
          mechanism to shift the halves of the rotor when a ship heads
          about and takes a new course in the opposite direction.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The full-sized experimental
          boat, nearing completion, will be used to try out rotors of
          various sizes and constructions. Different rotors of the same
          size will e covered with canvas, plywood and aluminum and
          tested to discover which material is best suited for the work.
          To drive a 70-foot cabin cruiser, Lesh says, three rotors
          would be needed.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The curious arrangement of

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A new type of breakwater
          consisting of nothing more than air bubbles recently was
          devices for quieting even the highest waves of the sea. It is
          the invention of Phillip Brasher, an American. One of the
          units is said to have been operated successfully at El
          Segundo, CA, to protect a concrete pier.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The air breakwater consists
          of a perforated pipe that is laid along the sea bottom and
          connected with a land air-compressing station. In rough
          weather it is merely necessary to allow the compressed air to
          escape from the holes in the pipe, the air bubbles quickly
          rising to the surface. The wall of bubbles is said to break up
          the waves and retard their forward motion. When the water from
          a broken wave flows back to form a base for the next incoming
          wave, it finds no support and the next wave curls over and
          breaks.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The repetition of this
          process is said to result in a smooth surface beyond the
          pipeline, no matter how rough the weather. A simple
          installation of the pipe system, the inventor says, is
          sufficient to provide a harbor of smooth water in exposed
          points around coasts that have caused trouble in the past.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My invention relates to an
          improved method of and apparatus for use in connection with
          water waves, being more particularly adapted for collapsing
          water waves to produce a relatively quiescent area of
          appreciable size in proximity to a ship, whereby planes can be
          launched from the ship without the use of a catapult, and may
          be picked up again without the necessity of the ship coming to
          rest.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More specifically the
          present invention provides for collapsing water waves
          continuously from a ship which may be proceeding at 12 or 15
          knots or even at higher speeds, the quiescent area thus
          produced overlapping in extent to permit the launching of a
          plane from the moving ship without a catapult and to permit
          the plane t be picked up again without stopping the ship.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My invention, it will be
          appreciated, is of great practicable worth in connection with
          combating submarines, in that any ship large enough to carry a
          plane, but which may be too small to carry a catapult, can be
          employed for reconnaissance purposes and for actual bombing of
          submarines, launching and picking up of the plane being
          feasible and practicable with the ship under way so that she
          may be maneuvered if desired.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be seen from the
          description hereinafter given that the equipment necessary for
          the practice of my invention is simple, and takes up only a
          fraction of the space required for catapult launching
          apparatus. The plane can be launched and picked up with a
          crane. As a consequence the number of ships which may carry
          one or more planes is enormously increased as compared with
          existing practice.</font> </p>

          the hose 6 is to be towed overboard, its length will depend
          upon the height and length of the ship. In practice it should

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In practicing my invention
          the hose is thrown overboard and towed by the ship when a
          plane is to be launched or picked up. As above noted,
          launching and picking up are performed with the ship traveling
          at say 12 or 15 knots which will give it the desired steerage
          way and maneuverability. The open end 8 of the hose 6 is to be
          submerged to a depth of 75 to 100 feet. For this reason and in
          order that the open end of the hose may be maintained at the
          desired distance from the ships' hull, and will not simply
          trail beside the ship, I equip the hose with a paravane 10.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When an elastic fluid such
          as air is discharged by the compressor through the submerged
          outer end of the hose 6, air and water will be forced to the
          surface to provide in effect an upwardly moving wall or damp
          against which approaching waves will dash and be collapsed.
          Back of this fluid breakwater or dam, that is, between it and
          the ship, there will be a quiescent area 12 of substantial
          proportions into which a plane may be launched from the ship
          simply by lowering the same overboard and from which a plane
          may be picked up. This quiescent area will be maintained even
          on intermittent operation of the compressor for two or three
          minutes after the compressor is shut off.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inasmuch as the quiescent
          area persists some two or three minutes after the compressor
          is shut off, it will be apparent that with a ship proceeding
          at say the equivalent of 5 miles per hour I can produce a
          quiescent area one-half to three-quarters of a mile long and
          of substantial width. The width of the quiescent area will
          depend, of course, upon the distance between the outer end of
          the hose 6 and the ship.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be appreciated,
          furthermore, that not only will the provision of such a
          quiescent area enable a plane to be launched from the ship
          without a catapult and to be picked up, but the ship itself
          will be in this area so as to provide a steady gun platform
          for both horizontal and antiaircraft fire should demands
          require it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is to be understood that
          for illustrative purposes I have shown but a single hose 6.
          Several may be employed if desired from the same or from
          opposed sides of the ship.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be seen that the
          equipment necessary for the practice of my invention is simple
          and inexpensive, requires by very small space on shipboard,
          and that no expensive controlling mechanism is necessary.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I wish it to be understood
          that any dimensions above mentioned as to length of hose,
          depth of submergence, size of hose, etc., are illustrative and
          not for purposes of limitation, and that the same may be
          changed within the purview of my invention.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Observing the motions of
          swimming fish, Franz Heudorf, German inventor, resolved to
          test their method of locomotion as a means of propelling
          watercraft. Recently he demonstrated, with working models, a
          new drive, dispensing entirely with propellers, which the
          inventor maintains is especially adaptable to submarines.
          Small rotating fins on each side of the vessel are operated
          independently of one another, and may be set to cause the
          craft to go forward or astern, turn to port or starboard, and
          dive or come to the surface without pumping ballast. Plans are
          reported under way for the construction of a man-carrying
          submarine using the new system of fins as propellers.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Using the power of the waves
          to drive a stationary power plant has been proposed before,
          but it remained for a Long Beach CA inventor to design a
          wave-operated mechanism to propel a boat. Models used to try
          out the odd principle are reported to have shown surprising
          speed in tests, one miniature 18-inch craft attaining a pace
          of 5 miles an hour. Similar gear, the inventor suggests, could
          be applied to any full-sized craft, and could be attached or
          removed at will. The equipment comprises three fins attached
          to flexible joints, which are set vibrating by the slightest
          motion of the water, and are interconnected in such a way that
          they transform the vertical movement of the waves into
          impulses that drive the boat forward.</font> </p>

                hour"</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Skimming the surface like a
          gull, a speedboat that rises clear out of the water has just
          completed its first trial runs successfully at Marshfield, OR.
          It resembles a hybrid between an airplane and a watercraft.
          Plywood-covered fins, shaped like airplane wings, extend from
          the sides in three successively smaller steps. By lifting the
          boat into the air, they virtually eliminate water friction on
          the hull and permit 70-mph speed without using unusual power.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Seated behind a small
          windshield in the one-man cockpit, the pilot operates a 55-hp
          motor of outboard type that dries the new boat. It behaves
          like an ordinary craft until it attains a speed of 45-mph. At
          this velocity, which corresponds to the takeoff speed of an
          airplane, an abrupt change occurs. The pilot can feel the boat
          rise from the water as the fins take hold on the air. Only the
          propeller beneath the hull remains I the water where its full
          thrust is effective. A small water rudder used a t low speed
          is now ineffective, and an air rudder, resembling an airplane
          tail fin, steers the boat. Most noticeable to an occupant is
          the absence of the bumping sensation experienced in fast
          watercraft. The cushion of air between the hull and the water
          acts as a shock absorber; the boat is literally riding on air.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other advantages of the
          strange craft are pointed out by the inventor, Victor W.
          Strode, of Portland, OR., who has been granted a patent on the
          unconventional design. The boat turns in an abnormally short
          radius, with little tendency to tip. It possesses unusual
          stability largely because of the care with which the propeller
          was placed after a series of experiments --- about one-third
          of the way back from the bow of the boat to the stern.
          Complete streamlining minimizes air resistance and fuel
          consumption. While the hull weighs twice as much as one of the
          standard type, its extra weight is more than offset by the
          lift of the wings.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the first model is an
          experimental one, the inventor has made no attempt to provide
          seating accommodations for passengers. Its success in further
          trials may presage the building of similar, larger craft with
          enclosed passenger cabins. They would be suitable for use as
          pleasure craft, as mail or naval dispatch boats, or for
          high-speed passenger transport over inland water routs and
          might be used for express service for commuters.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be noted by

          section 11 has a greater depth than the sections 12 and 13

          exemplification they are arranged to be moved together, the
          purpose of which will be hereinafter explained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 8 will be noted a
          pivot, 19, and it will also be noted that the strut indicated
          numeral 9 contains a cylinder 20, a piston 21, to which is
          operatively attached a piston rod 22, operatively connected to
          a trunnion pin 23, movable in a slot 24, the said slot 24, it
          will be understood, being formed interiorly in the element 11,
          and the trunnion operable by the trunnion pin 23, is movable
          vertically under the influence of the piston 21, and the
          shoulders 25, 26, 27 and 28 are adapted to engage and move the
          sections 12, 13, 14 and 15 in unison with respect to 11.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A fluid pressure supply pipe
          29 is shown and will be presumed to be attached operatively to
          a reservoir of fluid pressure which is not shown since such
          things are old and well known and need no explanation.
          Suitable valves or other means of control will be supplied
          between the said reservoir and the supply pipe 29 to permit
          actuating the piston 21 selectively by fluid pressure.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No means are shown or
          required for the reverse of the action produced y the piston
          21 since as soon s the wing is in the air the lift of the wing
          itself will accomplish this function.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operating a plane having
          pontoons for landing gear up to this time the pontoon has
          served a single purpose --- that is, to act as a float upon
          which a plane could be landed in the water and upon which it
          would rest due to the buoyancy of the pontoon when the plane
          was not being used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A great deal of thought and
          study, testing in wind tunnels and the like has convinced
          airplane designers generally that what is known in the
          terminology of aeronautics as "parasite drag" was unavoidable.
          The ordinary pontoon from the moment of its being lifted clear
          of water upon which it rests starts to fight the horizontal
          rudders and to a degree dependent upon the air speed and
          increasing with the square of the speed until the plane is
          again landed on the water. This characteristic of the ordinary
          pontoon has reduced the payload of a seaplane to which they
          are attached, greatly increased the consumption of fuel and
          substantially subtracted from general reliability.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is well known in the
          state of the art that "taking off" from the surface of the
          water with a seaplane is accomplished with greater facility if
          the surface of the water is somewhat rough from the wind has
          wavelets traveling toward the plane that will give the pontoon
          a jump as a wave strikes the pontoon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the may features of
          my invention is found in that my upper surfaces, that is
          surfaces that are always in contact with the air, are of
          airfoil shape and will in most cases conform very closely to
          the upper surface of the wing of the plane upon which they are
          intended to be used. The under surface will also be curved
          somewhat but less and will ordinarily be made as straight as
          can be safely done.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since a surface, as the
          underside of a wing, adapted to air pressure, is not normally
          the same thing as a surface adapted to&nbsp; water contact
          such as a boat bottom or the underside of a pontoon, somewhat
          of a compromise is necessary; the under&nbsp; or wetted
          surface as illustrated in the drawings fairly represents the
          state of present knowledge on the subject though it is
          expected to be modified somewhat in the light of experience.
          This compromise surface being a practically new intangible,
          will for the purpose of this specification and claims be
          referred to as a "dual surface".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be noted also from
          the drawings, well illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3, that
          the several sections such as 11 to 15 inclusive are stepped on
          both their upper and lower surfaces from companion sections.
          This affords what amounts to a plane surface such as the
          projected area the width of which is indicated by numeral 30.
          This is intended to prevent drift either in the water or in
          the air, when making a turn either in landing or taking off
          from the surface of the water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is generally agreed among
          aeronautical engineers that roughly 75% of the lift of an
          airfoil is due to vacuum on top. It is notable, however, that
          only about 15% of the 75% is available unless air is also in
          contact with the underside of the wing or airfoil section. It
          therefore appears that for the most part the actual lift comes
          from the underside and that the vacuum on top of the airfoil
          merely lowers the resistance against which the wing is acting.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In taking off with a
          seaplane equipped with pontoons made after the pattern of my
          new hull, each separate section, such as 11 to 15 inclusive,
          will exert lift in a small amount while its undersurface is
          wetted and is a true airfoil the instant it breaks contact
          with the water. Let us take for example the two sections
          indicated by numerals 14 and 14 and assume that 14 has an
          upper area of 5 square feet and that all of the other similar
          surfaces, such as 15 on the same pontoon and 14 and 15 on the
          other pontoon, have equal areas, then the total area will be
          20 square feet. Assuming that a speed over the surface of the
          water in taking off has been attained that will lift these
          four sections clear of the surface and assuming that at that
          speed the wings of the plane have a lift equal to 8 pounds per
          square foot, then the instant these four section are lifted
          clear of the water the total lift, due to sections 14 and 15,
          will at assumed conditions be 160 pounds, or the effect on the
          plane precisely a if a 1660-pound sandbag were thrown
          overboard. This produces that highly desirable jump heretofore
          mentioned as an assistance in taking off and to a degree and
          in a manner far better than can be produced by a wave on the
          surface of the water. It will also be remembered that this
          jump will in most cases allow air to get under the next
          adjoining section when an additional and greater lift will be
          instantly effective.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will thus be seen that a
          plane equipped with pontoons made according to the plan of my
          new hull will lift a larger load, and load conditions being
          equal will leave the surface of the water quicker at a given
          speed or will actually take off at a much lower speed than
          with the conventional pontoon.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When flying the hulls
          eliminate parasite drag and add their area to the wing surface
          area. The takeoff speed of the plane will be affected
          favorably by changing the angle of the outside sections as
          shown in Figure 1. This change is also desirable alike in
          landing as in taking off. When it is desired to land the
          control device, of which the fluid pressure means shown is an
          example, will change the relative position of the outside
          sections with respect to the inside section 11, so that
          contact with the water will occur first well back on the
          bottom and if the fluid pressure control is used it may act as
          a substantial and efficient shock absorber to prevent the
          shock of landing on the surface of the water being transmitted
          through the struts to the fuselage of the plane. This is a
          very valuable feature that may be attained without extra first
          cost or increased weight.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 5 is a modification
          of Figure 1 in that the pivot 19 supports also the strut 10a,
          and the angle of incidence then of the whole hull will be
          changed at once. This is shown as an alternative construction
          and is not thought at present to be as desirable as the form
          previously described in detail. In a flying boat, that is to
          say an airplane having a fuselage adapted to be landed
          directly on the water, it will be difficult to make the
          several sections such as 11 to 15 inclusive movable with
          respect to each other and it is believed that making them so
          movable would not have advantages sufficient to offset
          increased cost and excess weight. This will also be true in a
          hull such as that for a speedboat or any craft intended to
          remain upon the water.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My new hull, in a flying
          boat will have the effect of adding a substantial amount of
          wing surface and reducing the parasite drag, and in a
          speedboat it will have the effect of lightening the craft by
          the amount of lift afforded by each section as it comes clear
          of the water. In the speedboat as in the flying boat, lateral
          stability will be enhanced and the lifting power of an airfoil
          will be available to lighten the craft as the speed increases
          and to provide a stability heretofore unattainable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many variations of the
          construction illustrated and/or described may be possible now
          that the basic idea is disclosed. I therefore do not desire to
          limit myself except as specifically stated in the following

          detail, 1 denotes the hull of a marine vessel, 2 the propeller
          which is carried by a propeller shaft formed of a section 3
          and a section 4, which are operatively connected together
          through the medium of a clutching mechanism 5. The section 4
          of the propeller shaft is provided with a beveled gear 7,
          carried by a vertically disposed transmission shaft 8.
          Bearings 9 are provided for the shaft sections 3 and 4, and
          bearings 10 and 11 for the vertically disposed shaft 8.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mounted on the flooring 12,
          or other support, is a vertically extending hollow tubular
          element 13, which is of a length as to project up through a
          vertical frame 14 secured on the upper deck of the vessel. The
          top of the frame 14, is indicated at 15, and is formed with a
          vertically disposed opening 16, for the passage of member 13.
          Carried by the top 15 and arranged to align with the opening
          16, is a flange collar 17, formed with groove 18, for the
          reception of bearing balls 19. The tubular member 13, is
          mounted in a bearing 20, carried by the flooring or support
          12, and is also rotatably supported on the collar 17, through
          the medium of the balls 19, extending into a flanged collar
          21, which is fixedly secured to the member 13., near the upper
          end thereof. The collar 21 overlaps the bearing balls 19, and
          also the collar 17.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Connected to the upper end
          of the member 13, and bodily movable with said member 13, is a
          conduit 22, which is disposed lengthwise with respect to the
          length of the marine vessel, and the conduit 22, at its
          forward end, is funnel-shaped or flaring as at 23, and has
          projecting from the rear portion thereof, a plurality of vanes
          24. The conduit 22, has depending therefrom, a plug 25, which
          is fixedly secured to the conduit 22, through the medium of
          hold fast devices 26. The plug 25 is provided with a centrally
          arranged opening 27, which registers with an opening 28,
          formed in the bottom of the conduit 22.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The transmission shaft 8
          extends up through the member 13, plug 29, the opening 28,
          into the conduit 22, and has its upper end provided with a
          beveled gear 29.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Extending longitudinally of
          the conduit 22, and terminating at a point removed from the
          flaring end 23 of said conduit 22, is a shaft 30, which is
          mounted in bearings 31, carried by transverse supports 32,
          secured within the conduit 22.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The shaft 30 is provided
          with a series of rotors 33, in the form of wind wheels and
          each of which consists of a hub 34, an a series of closely
          arranged radially extending blades 35, which are disposed
          obliquely with respect to the hub 34. The blades 35 extend in
          close proximity to the inner face of the conduit 22. The
          rotors are arranged in two sets spaced from each other.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Carried by the shaft 30, and
          arranged between the rotors 33, are stationary guide elements
          36, and each of which consists of a hub 37, and a series of
          radially extending arms 37, having angle-shaped terminals 38,
          which are secured to the inner face of the conduit 22. The
          number of arms 38 of a guide is less than the number of blades
          35 of a rotor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Secured to the shaft 30,
          intermediate the ends thereof, is a beveled gear 10, which
          meshes with the beveled gear 29.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The conduit 22, and guides
          36, provide means for directing an air current against the
          rotors 33, whereby the shaft 30 will be operated, and owing to
          eh meshing of the gear 40, with the gear 29, the transmission
          shaft 8 will be driven, causing thereby the operation of the
          propeller shaft, as the shaft 8 is operatively connected with
          the propeller shaft through the medium of the gears 6 and 7.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The clutching mechanism 5 is
          so set up, that the shaft 3 can be driven in either direction.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Owing to the manner in which
          the conduit 22 is set up, that is to say with respect to the
          member 15, it can swing in the desired direction, so that air
          currents from any direction can be utilized in driving the
          rotors 33. The currents passing through the conduit 22, will
          be held in a straight course, through the medium of the guides
          36, so that the blades 35 will be uniformly impacted by the
          currents causing thereby the driving of the shaft 30.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the foregoing
          description taken in connection with the accompanying
          drawings, a power generating device is set up, which can be
          employed for propelling marine vessels or driving machine
          parts, and although the referred embodiment of the invention
          is as shown, yet changes in the details of construction can be
          had without departing from the spirit of the invention as
