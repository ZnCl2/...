      A Danish invention with an air cushion built into the hull the
      world’s large container and tanker vessels will probably soon mean
      a tremendous fall in energy consumption and the CO2 emission to
      the atmosphere. With a new air cavity system in the hull the
      world’s large containers and tankers will probably soon be able to
      reduce their energy consumption significantly and consequently
      also the CO2 emission into the atmosphere by 10-15 per cent,
      writes Børsen Business Daily. ”Oil consumption constitutes the
      largest cost for the operation of a vessel. With the increasing
      oil prices and the new global focus on the shipping industry’s
      huge contribution to the climate changes this is an enormous
      potential,” says general manager and owner Christian Eyde Møller
      from DK Group which has the patent of Air Cavity System (ACS) that
      is the name of the new air cavity technology. According to the
      company’s own estimates the new technology will be able to save
      9,000 ton oil annually in an 11-13,000 TEU (twenty feet container
      units). With the present oil prices this is the equivalent of a
      financial saving of DKK 17.5 million and reduced CO2 emission of
      36,000 ton - and this with an investment of just 2-3 per cent on
      top of the building price. According to DK - Group’s general
      manager it will give a repayment time of just two and a half
      years.<br>

      The invention relates to a system for providing an air lubricating
      layer between a substantially flat bottom (3) of a vessel (1) and
      the water flowing under the bottom as the vessel is moving through
      the water, whereby the system comprises sidewalls (5,5') and a top
      wall (4) defining a cavity (6) with an opening (13) situated in an
      interface plane that is transversal to the sidewalls (5,5'), at
      the level of the flat bottom (3), the opening having a front end
      (9) and a rear end (15) seen in the length direction of the
      cavity, an air inlet (10) spaced from the opening for introducing
      air into the cavity, whereby the length of the opening (13) of the
      cavity (6) is between 2 and 10m and the distance (H) of the top
      wall (4) from the interface plane is between 0,2 m and 0,5 m.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Field of the invention </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention relates to a system for providing an air lubricating
      layer between the hull of a vessel and the water flowing under the
      hull as the vessel i s moving through the water. The invention
      also relates to a displacement vessel comprising such a system, to
      a method of operating such a system in a displacement vessel and
      to a method of providing such a system in a displacement vessel,<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      WO 2010/064911 describes how to generate a layer of micro bubbles
      on the hull of a displacement vessel in order to reduce frictional
      drag, by means of a cavity being provided in a flat bottom area of
      the hull of a vessel, such that an opening of the cavity is at the
      flat bottom area. Air is injected into the cavity at such a rate
      that the water level in the cavity is kept substantially at the
      level of the hull of the vessel. Due to the forward movement of
      the vessel, the air in the cavity will move relative to the water
      at the speed at which the vessel is moving, or seen from the
      cavity, the water will flow past the cavity at that speed. This
      difference in velocity between the air and the water causes a
      so-called Kelvin Hehnholtz Instability (KHI) which results in a
      mixing of air and water at the interface between the water and the
      air, and in a consequential generation of a layer of small sized
      air bubbles. The small size of these air bubbles makes them very
      stable and they tend to stay in the water for a relative long
      period. The small bubbles generated in the cavity are released
      there from at the rear edge of the cavity such that they form a
      stable lubricating layer extending a long distance along the
      bottom of the hull downstream of the cavity. In this way energy
      savings in propulsion of a vessel can be achieved. It is an object
      of the invention to provide an improved system for providing an
      air lubricating layer between the hull of a vessel and the water
      flowing under the hull as the vessel is moving through the water,
      which can more easily be incorporated in the hull of a vessel. 1<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide an
      improved system for providing an air lubricating layer that can be
      operated in an efficient and stable manner in wave conditions. it
      is a further object of the invention to provide a displacement
      vessel incorporating such a system.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the invention to provide a method of
      operating such a system in a displacement vessel .<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the invention to provide a method at
      retrofitting such a system into the hull of an existing
      displacement vessel, without weakening of the existing hull. It is
      another object to provide a method of retrofitting without
      interfering with the cargo space of the vessel.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      To meet these objectives the present invention provides a system
      for providing an air lubricating layer between a substantially
      flat bottom of the hull of a vessel and the water flowing under
      the bottom as the vessel is moving through the water, whereby the
      system comprises sidewalls and a top wall defining a cavity with
      an opening situated in an interface plane that is transversal to
      the sidewalls, substantially at the level of the flat bottom, the
      opening having a front end and a rear end seen in the length
      direction of the cavity, an air inlet spaced from the opening for
      introducing air into the cavity, wherein the length of the opening
      of the cavity is between 2 m and 10 m, preferably between 2 m and
      7 m, more preferably between 2 m and 5 m, and the distance (H) of
      the top wall from the interface plane is between 0.2 m and 0.5 m.
      The inventors have realized that a length of the opening of the
      cavity of between 2 m and 10 m, at a height of 0.2 m to 0.5 m
      results in forming a stable and well-defmed lubricating air-water
      mixture at the interface between the water and the air in the
      cavity. This was also found for cavities having a length of
      between 2 m and 5 m, for a distance of the top wall from the
      interface plane of between 0,2 m and 1.5 m, preferably of between
      0.2m and 1.0 m, most preferably of between 0.2 m and 0.5 m.<br>
      <br>
      Compared to the relatively large opening and large volume of the
      cavity known from WO 2010/064911 which is suggested to be between
      5 m and 30 m long, and up to 5 m in height, the inventors have
      found that the cavity can be made much smaller while operating in
      a stable and efficient manner and at the same time is more easy to
      incorporate into the hull of a vessel. In particular when such a
      system is retrofitted, it is advantageous that cavity is as small
      as possible in order to minimize any weakening effect of the
      structure of the hull. n particular, a cavity height of less than
      0.5 m allows the system to be arranged between the two hulls in a
      double bottom or a double hull vessel, which means that the
      available cargo space is not affected by the incorporation of the
      system into the vessel. The cavi ty known from WO 2010/064911 has
      a height of up to 5 m, which means that it will extend into the
      cargo space of the vessel, whereby less cargo can be transported
      by the vessel. Furthermore, smaller systems require less material
      and are easier to handle.<br>
      <br>
      Another disadvantage of a 30 m long cavity, such as known from WO
      2010/064911, is that wa ves will start to form inside the cavity,
      whereby at the rear end of the cavity such waves will cause an
      uneven exiting of the water-air mixture from the cavity. This
      means that the lubricating layer formed between the hull and the
      water flowing underneath it will be uneven and thereby less
      efficient. The inventor has realized that the relatively short
      length of the cavity according to the invention and its relatively
      shallow shape are sufficient to form an appropriate water-air
      mixture at the interface between the water and the air in the
      cavity, which air layer when exiting the cavity extends across a
      long length of the flat bottom, ensuring a good lubricating effect
      on the hull of the vessel, and that at the same time no
      significant wave formation will occur in such a short cavity. The
      cavity according to the invention is relatively insensitive to
      waves and functions well without loss of air even when the vessel
      has large heave, roll and pitch motions.<br>
      <br>
      It has also been found that air consumption by use of a relatively
      small cavity can be reduced while still maintaining an effective
      friction reducing lubricating effect. Apart from the more uniform
      and thereby improved lubricating effect obtained by such a
      relative short cavity, it is also advantageous that the chamber is
      relative short when it has to be retrofitted into the existing
      hull of a vessel. It saves material and labor cost when it has to
      be welded into the hull,<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the cavity has a width between 0.5 m and 1.5 m.
      Several cavities can be distributed across the hull of the vessel
      side by side and/or behind the other when seen in a length
      direction. When at least the portion of the rear end of the cavity
      being adjacent the opening is sloping towards the opening, the
      sloping wall part extending to the position of a substantially
      hori ontal bottom plane, the air-water mixture will be guided
      smoothly underneath the hull and provide a uniform lubricating
      effect even when the vessel is rolling or moving due to waves on
      the sea, and thereby ensure an even release of the lubricating
      layer underneath the hull of the vessel . Preferably, the system
      is applied in a flat bottom vessel and the rear end of the cavity
      slopes downwardly to intersect the bottom plane of the hull in
      order for a smooth transition of the bubbles form ed in the
      cavity. Preferably, the sloping wall part of the cavity is tangent
      to the bottom plane at the position of the bottom plane to provide
      a stable transition of the air bubble layer from the cavity along
      the substantially flat bottom of the hull of the vessel, forming a
      long bubble tail extending over a long distance in a rearward
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, at least the portion of the rear end of the cavity
      being adjacent the opening is convex. This will even further
      improve the manner in which the lubricating layer is allowed to be
      introduced underneath the hull.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, means are provided to control the volume of air being
      introduced into the cavity proportional to a width of the cavity,
      dependent upon the speed of the vessel , such that for a cavity of
      a width of about 1 m:<br>
      <br>
      at a speed of 4 m/s an airflow of between 7 and 70 m &lt;3&gt;/h
      is provided,<br>
      <br>
      at a speed of 5 m/s an airflow of between 15 and 150 m Vh is
      provided,<br>
      <br>
      at a speed of 6 m/s an airflow of between 25 and 250 m &lt;3&gt;/h
      is provided,<br>
      <br>
      at a speed of 7 m/s an airflow of between 45 and 450 m Vh is
      provided, at a speed of 8 m/s an airflow of between 70 and 700 m h
      is provided,<br>
      <br>
      at a speed of 9 m/s an airflow of between 15 and 150 m7h is
      provided,<br>
      <br>
      at a speed of 0 m/s an airflow of between 100 and 1000 m7h is
      provided,<br>
      <br>
      at a speed of 11 m/s an airflow of between 140 and 1400 m
      &lt;3&gt;/h is provided, and at a speed of 12 m/s an airflow of
      between 260 and 2600 m &lt;J&gt;/h is pro vided.<br>
      <br>
      The control system can comprise a processor and memory device
      connected to the air compressor feeding the air into the cavity.
      The inventor has found a specific relationship between the speed
      of the vessel and the amount of air being required in order to
      provide a given lubricating effect, which is about proportional to
      the width of the cavity. Hence, the airflow can be regulated
      without the need for any sensors inside the cavity. This greatly
      simplifies the system itself, and furthermore reduces the cost
      involved at its installation. Preferably, the distance between the
      sidewalls of the cavity decreases in a forward direction so that
      the front part of the cavity has a 'dagger'-shape. This shape
      serves to eliminate or at least reduce any wave formations which
      might be generated inside the cavity when the water level is not
      completely flush with the lower edge of the front wall.<br>
      <br>
      When the system is formed as a module which, for example, is to be
      retrofitted into the hull of an existing vessel, it can comprise a
      flat plate section extending around the opening, said flat plate
      section being adapted to be welded into an opening in the hull of
      a vessel. This facilitates the installing and welding in place of
      the module in the hull of the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a system for providing an air
      lubricating layer between a substantially fl at bottom of a vessel
      and the water flowing under the bottom as the vessel is moving
      through the water, whereby the system comprises sidewalls and a
      top wall defining a cavity with an opening defining an interface
      plane located at a distance from the top wall, substantially at
      the level of the flat bottom, the opening having a front end and a
      rear end seen, when in use, in the direction of forward movement
      of the vessel, an air inlet separate from the opening for
      introducing air into the cavity, and at least one wave deflecting
      member extending inside the cavity in the width direction, at a
      distance from the interface plane, the wave deflecting member
      being fixed to the side walls and/or top wall and being oriented
      substantially transversely to the interface plane.<br>
      <br>
      Such a wave deflecting member facilitates the starting-up of the
      system. Before the system is activated the cavity will normally be
      full of water. Thus, the system must be able to be activated when
      the vessel is moving at its travelling speed through water. When
      starting to introduce air into the cavity, the water level will be
      at the top of the cavity, and the flow of water under the hull of
      the vessel, will cause a vers'' violent turbulence inside the
      cavity, drawing a large volume of air out of the cavity before the
      level of water has reached the level of the opening. Thus, it
      requires a very large airflow to start the system, much larger
      than what is required to run the system at a steady state.
      Consequently, an air source having a high capacity is required.
      However, if one or more wave deflecting member(s) are provided
      inside the cavity, the turbulence generated by the waves emerging
      from the front end edge of the cavity, and the turbulence
      generated there from will be deflected whereby less air will be
      drawn out of the cavity during the initial startup of the system.
      Consequently, an air source having a lower capacity, a capacity
      which is only slightly larger than what is required to run the
      system at a steady state, is sufficient in order to be able to
      start the system.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the at least one wave deflecting member is curved,
      whereby it will even better dampen the wave formation inside the
      cavity. The invention also provides a displacement vessel having a
      water displacement of at least 10.000 tons, preferably 50.000 tons
      and more and comprising at least one cavity for providing an air
      lubricating layer between the hull of the vessel and the water
      flowing under the hull as the vessel is moving through the water,
      the vessel having a substantially flat bottom extending
      substantially across the width thereof, the flat bottom having a
      length of at least 10 m, preferably at least 20 m, and a
      propulsion device for sailing at a speed, the opening of the
      cavity being substantially at the level of the flat bottom, and
      such that a portion of the flat bottom having a length at least as
      great as the length of a cavity, preferable at least 15m, extends
      downstream from the each, cavity.<br>
      <br>
      In order to create a lubricating layer across the width of the
      hull of a large vessel a plurality of cavities can be arranged
      substantially adjacent over at least a part of the width of the
      hull.<br>
      <br>
      For a long vessel, a plurality of cavities or a plurality of rows
      of adjacent transversely extending cavities can be arranged after
      each other in the longitudinal direction of the hull. The
      lubricating effect of the bubbles emitted from a cavity will begin
      to become less after 50 to 100 m, whereby, in a large vessel which
      can be up to 400 m long, it is appropriate to provide at least 4-8
      cavities distributed in the length direction, or 4-8 rows of
      adjacent transversely extending cavities, after each other in the
      longitudinal direction of the vessel. The invention also provides
      a method of operating a system for providing an air lubricating
      layer between the hull of a vessel having a substantially flat
      bottom and the water flowing under the hull as the vessel is
      moving through the water, the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      -introducing air into the cavity to expel water out of the cavity,<br>
      <br>
      -continue introducing air into the cavity at such a rate that the
      water level in the cavity will be kept substantially at the level
      of the outer surface of the flat bottom, whereby when the vessel
      is moving forwards through water the air in the cavity will mix
      with the water at the air-water interface, thereby forming a
      air-water mixture, and<br>
      <br>
      - allowing said mixture to exit said cavity below the rear edge
      thereof, along the width of the opening, such that it will form a
      lubricating layer along the flat bottom downstream of the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the air is injected into the cavity in such a way as to
      avoid direct impingement onto the air-water mixture. In order for
      the KHI to work properly, and to avoid the formation of large
      bubbles which will have only a poor lubricating effect, which does
      not last very long, it is important that the air-water interface
      is not affected by a strong jet of injected air. Preferable the
      air is injected into the chamber via a large opening, whereby the
      speed of the air at the inlet opening can be kept low, preferably
      below 5-10 m/s.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides a method of providing a system as set
      out above, in the hull of a vessel, the method comprising:<br>
      <br>
      -cutting a hole in the hull of the vessel,<br>
      <br>
      -positioning the opening such that it communicates with the hole
      and welding the walls of the cavity to the hull of the vessel,<br>
      <br>
      -connecting an air duct to the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      According to this method, the system can easily be provided in the
      hull of an existing vessel, whereby energy saving for propulsion
      of up to 15% can be achieved in existing vessels. Brief

        Detailed description of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fig. 1 shows a schematic side of a vessel 1 according to the
      invention having a hull 2 and a bottom surface 3. The hull 2 has a
      length Lh of for instance between 50 m and 400 m, measured along
      the bottom surface 3,<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 2 the bottom surface 3 of the vessel I comprises
      two rows of cavities 6, each having five cavities 6.1a to 6.1 e
      and 6.2a to 6.2e arranged next to each another across the width Wv
      of the vessel. The width Wv may be between 10 and 50 m, for
      instance between 15 m and 20 m. The rows are shown as having a
      general V-shape, but the cavities could also be arranged on a
      straight of curved line, or in any other pattern. The number of
      cavities is selected according to the width Wv of the bottom
      surface 3. It is, however, also possible to have a single cavity
      in the bottom surface 3. The cavities preferable all have the same
      dimensions, but they could also have different dimension, for
      example the cavities near the side of the vessel could have a
      different shape and/or size.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 3-5 shows a cavity 6 having a front end 9, a rear end 15, a
      top wall 4, a rear wall 16, two side walls 5, 5', and an air inlet
      10, an air supply duct 11 connected to the air inlet 10. The
      cavity 6 further comprises an opening 13 which is substantially
      flush with bottom surface 3 of the hull. The opening 13 has a
      length Lc which is relatively short compared the vessel length Lh
      and which lies between 2 m and 10 m. The width W of the opening 13
      (see Fig. 5) is preferable between 0,5 m and 1,5 m. The cavity has
      a height H, measured from the bottom surface 3 to a top wall 4,
      which may be between 0,2 m and for instance 0,5 m.<br>
      <br>
      Other small size cavities having a length Lc between 1.5m and 5 m
      at a height H of between 0.2 m and 1.5 m, preferably 0.2 m and 1 m
      also provide an efficient and stable air lubricating layer.<br>
      <br>
      Near a front end 9 of the cavity 6, an air inlet 10 is provided,
      which is connected to an air supply duct 1 1. A compressor 12
      takes in atmospheric air through a duct 11 and supplies compressed
      air to the cavity 6 in order to expel water from the cavity. A
      controller 20, such as a computer device, is connected to the
      compressor 12 for operating the compressor depending on the speed
      of the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      When the vessel is sailing through the water the moving water
      across the water-air interface in the cavity 6 results in a Kelvin
      Helmholtz Instability and forms small-sized bubbles 14. These
      bubbles escape via a bubble outflow region at the rear end 15 of
      the cavity 6. At the rear end 15, the cavity 6 has a downwardly
      sloping surface, forming a wedge-shaped space near the rear 15 of
      the cavity. From this outflow region, the bubbles 14 spread
      towards the aft 18 of the hull 2, to cover a majority of the
      bottom surface 3. The downwardly sloping surface can be formed as
      straight wall 16, or as a curved wail 16, The preferred embodiment
      of Fig. 3 shows a curved rear wall 16 which at the position 15 of
      the bottom surface 3 is tangent with said bottom surface 3. In
      order for the bubbles to be guided smoothly out of the cavity it
      is sufficient that the lower part of the rear wall 16 is curved or
      inclined. For a smooth transition of the bubbles from the cavity
      is important the rear wall 16 extends all the way to the position
      15 of the bottom surface 3. It is not necessary that the portion
      of the rear wall 16 being adjacent the top wall 4 is curved or
      inclined. This portion of the rear wall 16 could, for example, be
      vertical. As shown in Fig. 3 and 4, a number of wave deflecting
      members 7, 7', 7" extends transversely inside the cavity 6. These
      wave deflecting members stay clear from the top wall 4 and/or side
      walls 5, 5 'for allowing a free flow of air through the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the wave deflecting members extend to the top wall
      4 and/or side walls 5,5 but are transparent for air, for instance
      by being provided with perforations, or forming a mesh like
      pattern. These wave deflecting members 7, 7', 7" facilitate the
      starting-up of the system. Before the system is activated the
      cavity 6 will normally be full of water. The wave deflecting
      members 7, 7', 7" serve to deflect the waves emerging from the
      front end 9 of the cavity 6 when the vessel in moving forward
      through the water, and the turbulence generated there from will be
      deflected whereby less air will be drawn out of the cavity 6
      during the initial startup of the system. A single wave deflecting
      member 7 might be sufficient in some instances, whereas an
      improved effect is obtained by providing more wave deflecting
      members, such as 3 or 5, or more than 5. The wave deflecting
      member(s) can be fixed to the sidewalls 5, 5 ' and/or to the top
      wall 4,<br>
      <br>
      The at least one wave deflecting member 7 can be curved, or it can
      be formed by a substantially plane element arranged vertically, or
      at an inclined angle, such that it sloped towards the aft 18 of
      the hull 2 in a downward direction. The members 7, 7', 7" can be
      solid or, optionally, be provided with holes or openings extending
      from a front to a rear side of a member 7, 7', 7".<br>
