            <p align="left"><i>Specific emotions --- anger, hate, grief,
                love, sex, joy and reverence --- produce distinct muscle
                movement. They’re the same in Mexico, Japan, Indonesia,
                and upstate New York. When you run through a cycle,
                expressing each of the seven with your fingertip, you
                feel better for it.</i> </p>
            <p align="left">In 1967 I took part, as pianist, in Pablo
              Casals’ master classes in San Juan, Puerto Rico. One day
              when Casals was teaching Haydn’s "Cello Concerto", he
              asked a participant, a young master in his own right, to
              play the theme from the third movement. His playing was
              expert, sure and graceful. But for Casals something was
              missing. </p>
            <p align="left">The master stopped the performance. “No,
              no!”, he said, waving his hands. “That must be graceful!”.
            </p>
            <p align="left">He took up his own cello and played the same
              passage. And it was graceful, a hundred ties more graceful
              than we had just heard. Yes --- it seemed as though we had
              never heard grace before. We had experienced one of the
              least understood forms of human communication --- a
              powerful and clear transmittal f feeling without words, a
              feeling that penetrated our defenses and transformed our
              states of mind. </p>
            <p align="left">Casals played the same notes, and at similar
              speed. But the muscles of his hands and arms acted
              precisely together with his cello according to his very
              clear idea of grace. </p>
            <p align="left">How was his possible? How, precisely, was
              Casals’ expression different from the student’s? And how
              did the sound of his cello carry the idea and feeling of
              grace from his mind to ours? </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Action </b>--- These and similar
              questions that I thought about for many years led me to
              record and measure the precise motions of expressive
              action. My experiments on impulses from the pressure of a
              single finger, precisely expressing various fantasized
              emotional states have shown that there is a specific
              dynamic form of action underlying the expression of each
              emotion, and that the dynamic character of this
              action-form probably is universal, unlearned, and
              genetically programmed. </p>
            <p align="left">Emotions may be experienced in various
              aspects: (1) in a real situation, or (2) through fantasy
              --- as when one imagines being with a loved person. Also
              one may experience emotion trough empathy with another
              person who is (1) either really experiencing the emotion,
              or (2) experiencing it as fantasy --- as when one is
              watching a play or movie. </p>
            <p align="left">It is hard to study the quantitative effects
              of emotion in a real situation. In most experiments it is
              difficult to specify situation that reliably produce a
              given emotion. Repeated experiments are difficult to carry
              out under the same conditions. Emotions, in real
              situations, may today be less amenable to scientific study
              than fantasized emotions are. I have found a way of
              generating and expressing fantasy emotions that allows
              precise, repeated measurement. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Signs</b> --- How can one know what
              another person is feeling? Psychologists and other
              scientists have tried to identify outward, physical signs
              that correspond to each emotion. Perspiration,
              pupil-diameter, skin conductance, heart rate --- all have
              been used as objective, observable indications of internal
              states. But these are not uniformly related to experience
              --- anger turns some persons’ faces red, others, pale. </p>
            <p align="left">And yet, artists, musicians, dancers and
              actors are aware of the precision of emotions that may be
              communicated. They may communicate through movement of
              hands, legs, mouths, eyes, the whole body, and through
              tone of voice. The precise way that one uses his body to
              express an emotion is more important than the part of the
              body one sues [see “Body Talk --- A Game” by Layne
              Longfellow, <i>Psychology Today</i>, October 1970]. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Anger</b> --- We may consider that there
              is a common brain program for specific emotion that
              determines the character of the movement and its precise
              time course, regardless of the particular body movement
              that expresses it. Or, example, in expressing anger no
              matter what part of the body one uses, the brain program
              that determines the character of its time course is
              revealed. And this is in turn what we notice when we watch
              the movement and perceive anger. </p>
            <p align="left">In this method of generating and expressing
              fantasy emotions by a succession of single, expressive,
              appropriately timed acts, the fantasy emotion increases
              with each expression, until it reaches a peak that may be
              maintained for a time and then gradually dissipates. This
              dissipation takes place even though one continues to
              perform the expressive acts. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Finger</b> --- In view of this, I decided
              to use the expressive pressure movement of one finger as a
              standardized basic measure of expressed fantasized
              emotion. In my experiments, the subject sits in a
              straight-back chair and rests the middle finger of his
              right hand on a finger rest. I ask him to fantasize a
              given emotion (say, anger or love) for the next few
              minutes. Whenever he hears a signal --- a soft click ---
              he is to express that emotion as precisely as possible
              through the single, transient pressure of the finger. The
              clicks come at unpredictable intervals that vary by
              several seconds. The finger-rest is mounted with two
              pressure transducers that produce two graphic tracings of
              finger pressure during the two seconds immediately
              following the click. One tracing measures the finger’s
              vertical pressure; the other measures its horizontal
              pressure, toward the body and away from it. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Trials</b> --- Most subjects find it easy
              to express a fantasy emotion with a single finger
              pressure. About 70 percent can do it on the first set of
              trials. </p>
            <p align="left">To get a stable overall measurement, I
              usually have a subject express each emotion 50 times, then
              I feed the data into a computer of average transients
              (CAT) that averages the vertical tracings for a given
              emotion into one common vertical form and, likewise,
              extracts a common form from the horizontal tracings. I
              have found that the more a subject practices a clearly
              separate fantasy emotion, the more his individual
              expression tends to approach the common form for that
              emotion. </p>
            <p align="left">Usually I have a subject express anger,
              hate, grief, love, sex, joy, reverence, and a state of no
              emotion. </p>
            <p align="left">Expressing no emotion in this method is like
              the mechanical movement of typewriting: primarily
              downward, and slightly outward, away from the body. Anger
              is a similar emotion, but with reversed emphasis: outward
              movement is more pronounced than downward movement. Anger
              is a brief expression --- the finger returns to its
              original position in less than a second. Love is slower,
              and takes two seconds or more. Changes in pressure during
              love are gradual and smooth, and the horizontal tracings
              often show an inward, embracing movement. The form for sex
              is distinct from love. </p>
            <p align="left">Measurements of electrical activity in the
              muscles show that there is a secondary delayed pressure
              that begins after the expression has started. Such delayed
              muscular activity also occurs in hate --- another
              passionate emotion. Hate, like anger, involves a push away
              from the body. Grief is slow, like love, but is flatter
              and slightly outward. In joy, after an initial downward
              push, the finger pressure rebounds above its starting
              position, as if one were jumping for joy. Reverence is
              similar to love, but lacks the inward pull ad follows a
              longer tie scale --- the full expression of reverence may
              take three or four seconds. I first included fear among
              emotions that a subject was to fantasize, but I found that
              fear implied withdrawal and inhibition of expression and
              our technique could not measure this. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Oxygen</b> --- In many cases I have
              measured additional physiological variables during an
              experiment, and these measurements confirm both a specific
              pattern for the expression of each emotion, and the
              persistent physiological changes that accompany sustained
              fantasy emotions. During an expression by this method, the
              electrical activities in separate muscle groups (the
              forearm, upper arm, front shoulder and back) show
              reliable, identifiable patterns). Respiration also tends
              to follow a specific pattern: a subject tends to exhale as
              he expresses hate or grief, for example, and to inhale
              when he expresses joy. </p>
            <p align="left">Heart rate and oxygen consumption show
              definite, characteristic changes while a particular
              emotion is fantasized. Oxygen consumption appears to be
              highest in the states of hate and sex, lowest in love and
              reverence. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Stability</b> --- Emotional expressive
              forms measured in this way are stable and apparently
              universal. A subject will give essentially the same
              tracing for a single emotion on different occasions, and
              different subjects from different cultures produce
              remarkably similar tracings for a given emotion. We can
              state the degree of correspondence between any two
              measurements as a correlation in which zero indicates no
              relationship between one measure and the other and 1.0
              indicates a perfect match. Between two measurements of the
              same emotion in one person, the vertical tracings usually
              correlate above 0.90, whereas cross-correlations between
              different emotions are generally lower than 0.30. The
              forms are also remarkably consistent between individuals
              --- correlations between two persons’ expressions of an
              emotion are generally above 0.80. Dramatic differences can
              occur, and the discrepancy can be instructive. For
              example, when I compared my expressions to those of
              another subject, I found that our tracings were similar
              for most emotions (correlations of 0.80 or higher), but
              that for anger they differed sharply, with a negative
              correlation of 0.22. We learned that we interpreted the
              word anger differently. I had expressed an irritable,
              ready-to-strike-out anger, whereas my colleague’s anger
              was of the slow, burning type. The tracings seems to
              detect the word anger designates two different emotions. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Test</b> --- The observation raises an
              interesting question. Suppose two persons expressing an
              emotion (joy, for example) produce slightly different
              waveforms. Does this mean that they express the same
              emotion in different ways, or does the slight shape
              discrepancy imply a corresponding difference in the way
              the two feel joy? We cannot answer, but my research
              indicates that when there are large differences in form,
              there are large differences in the emotions experienced. </p>
            <p align="left">For example, I have tried to train subjects
              to express one emotion with the expressive form of another
              emotion, but they cannot learn to do it. I asked subjects
              to fantasize anger and try to experience this with the
              patern associated with love, and vice versa. When a
              subject’s tracings approached the love form, re received
              praise; when he reproduced anger-shaped waves, he was
              warned. But no matter ow hard he tried, no subject could
              generate and express anger by finger pressure resembling
              love. </p>
            <p align="left">With repeated expression, a subject’s
              fantasies became more and more intense. He may shed tears
              while he expresses grief, or become aroused. </p>
            <p align="left">Several investigators have shown that human
              beings can learn to control their bodies to an extent
              previously considered impossible. Peter Lang finds that,
              through immediate visual feedback about what some of his
              organs are doing, a subject can learn to control these as
              he would learn to drive a car [see "Automatic Control or
              Learning to Play the Internal Organs", by Peter Lang, <i>Psychol.
                Today</i>, October 1970]. </p>
            <p align="left">We gave our subjects no feedback about the
              shapes they were producing --- and yet their tracings
              became more accurate and precise as the trials went on.
              Clearly, something different from instrumental learning is
              involved here. It is as if one were discovering within
              himself those precise emotional expression programs that
              were there all along. This uncovering of the forms, and
              their resistance to change, suggest that the different
              basic emotional expressive forms are inborn --- not
              culturally learned --- a hypothesis that gains support
              from my finding that the forms are much the same from one
              culture to another. (The effect of culture may often be to
              suppress access to these forms, at some sage of
              development.) </p>
            <p align="left">I tested subjects in Mexico and Japan, and
              in Bali, Indonesia, and their basic shapes were the same
              as those of Americans. The few cross-cultural
              inconsistencies could be traced to language differences.
              Indonesians have no word for hate, and in Mexico <i>alegria</i>
              (happiness) was the closest approximation I could find for
              joy. Disparity between alegria tracings and the typical
              joy shape sowed just how inaccurate the translation was. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Rubicon </b>--- The brain programs the
              entire course of a single brief movement before it acts.
              Once the decision to move has been made --- a swing of a
              bat, or an eye movement, for example --- it must continue;
              for 200 milliseconds, one cannot change the movements of a
              limb or muscle by another decision because of limits in
              the nervous system. The existence of specific, universal
              brain programs corresponding to certain basic elements of
              experience is not a new discovery. In 1965, Michael Kohn
              and I measured the electrical activity originating from
              the different parts of subjects’ brains while the subjects
              looked at various colors. We found that with the help of a
              computer we could identify more than 100 separate brain
              responses to specific visual stimuli --- and the patterns
              had consistent physiologic code elements in all the
              subjects we tested. We could thus tell what color a
              subject was looking at from the pattern of electrical
              activity in his brain. </p>
            <p align="left">The spectrum of our emotions, like our
              perception of color, is precisely programmed by the brain.
              This programming is different for different emotions. We
              call a single programmed movement having a clear beginning
              and end, together with the decision giving rise to it, an
              <i>acton</i>. The emotion-seeking expression modulates
              actons into different E-actons for each emotion. E-actons
              are so precisely programmed into the brain that we have
              been able to find a differential equation that can be used
              to simulate these human forms of expression on a computer.
            </p>
            <p align="left">To understand how the idea of an emotion
              directs the body’s movements, consider what happens when a
              pitcher throws a ball at a target. He must have (1) a
              clear idea of where he wants to hit the target and (2) a
              precise execution. The idea of the target modulates his
              throwing motion, so that eventually one may choose any
              object within a certain range, think of hitting it, and a
              spatio-temporal form will direct the exact movements of
              the arm. As many a major-league pitcher has demonstrated,
              practice can refine the accuracy with which the idea is
              executed. </p>
            <p align="left">A similar process determines the expression
              of emotions. Effective emotional communication depends on
              (1) a clear idea of the emotion one wants to express and
              (2) a precise execution of the muscular acts involved ---
              finger movements, gestures, tone of voice, etc. The
              capacity to develop a clear idea of an emotion (which I
              call an <i>idiolog</i>) is as much a part of human nature
              as the ability to perceive red or sweet or hot. The
              idiolog accurately dictates the specific expressive
              movement (if it is permitted to do so). </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Animals</b> --- Any number of bodily
              movements can express a given emotional idiolog. The
              specific brain program for anger, which can turn an
              innocuous arm-raising into an angry threat, also can
              direct angry movements of the foot, or the mouth, or the
              tone of voice. In successful communication the specific
              brain program effectively commands a movement --- with no
              inhibitions to block the expression. We generally
              interpret direct, unhindered expression of emotion as
              faithful or sincere. </p>
            <p align="left">When one perceives an emotional expression,
              the nervous system recognizes the form, and decodes it
              into a corresponding emotional idiolog. As the receiver of
              such messages, the nervous system is programmed to
              interpret the shape of movements, and there is little we
              can do to change this program. We even attribute
              appropriate characteristics to animals whose movements
              remind us of human qualities we are programmed to
              recognize (for example, a graceful antelope or an uncouth
              hippopotamus). </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Cycle</b> --- In my first exploratory
              studies, I usually expressed no emotion 50 times in
              sequence and then expressed each of the seven emotions 50
              times. The entire process takes about 30 minutes. I call
              this a <i>sentic cycle</i>, according to the terms in my
              formal theory, in which the specific expression of an
              emotion is an <i>essentic form</i>, and the emotion brain
              programs that produces the form is a <i>sentic state</i>.
            </p>
            <p align="left">Although at first a subject may like to
              imagine various scenes to help him fantasize the emotion,
              he soon finds out that he can express an emotion without
              directing it at a specific person or imagining a specific
              scene. He learns to experience the emotion in itself, as
              in music, without needing specific provokers or recipients
              for the emotion. This pure emotion does not imply lack of
              consideration for the individual: when we understand and
              experience emotion in its most general sense, we are also
              most able to become genuinely concerned about and close to
              a particular person, that is, to develop empathy. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Peace</b> --- Often I go through several
              sentic cycles at a sitting. (A straight-backed chair and a
              correct arm position, I have found, a crucial to
              performing sentic cycles reliably and without fatigue).
              When I first began doing sentic cycles for several hours
              at a stretch, I was surprised to find that I was neither
              bored nor tired, but refreshed and satisfied, and that I
              required less sleep than usual the following night. </p>
            <p align="left">At first, I attributed these effects to
              enthusiasm and curiosity about a new discovery and to the
              satisfaction of completing a good day’s experiment. But I
              soon found that others reported similar feelings of
              well-being and satisfaction from repeated sentic cycles. </p>
            <p align="left">In further, systematic observation, I had
              subjects go through one-hour sessions made up of two
              sentic cycles. Most subjects reported that after the
              second cycle (which they often experienced more fully than
              the first), they felt calm, content --- some compared the
              experience to a marijuana high. </p>
            <p align="left">Other researchers have confirmed the general
              observation: performing sentic cycles lessened anxiety for
              3 to 24 hours. And, together with calmness, they often
              showed marked increases in mental energy. It is not
              necessary to record the expressive movements to reap these
              benefits. Practicing sentic cycles in the home, in the
              proper position and with the finger rest, works as well as
              performing in the laboratory. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Release</b> --- Many persons work off
              anger by punching at a wall or chopping wood. They say
              that the physical activity makes them feel better --- it
              releases the anger, "lets off steam". But it may not be
              the amount of energy expended that is effective, but the
              quality of anger that is expressed repeatedly. One can
              work off anger by appropriate and repeated pressing of a
              finger as effectively as by chopping a pile of wood. </p>
            <p align="left">Most of us tend to suppress emotions in our
              daily lives, but in sentic cycles one can express a
              spectrum of emotions freely, without embarrassment or fear
              of social censure. This freedom to discover and to be what
              is natural contributes to the satisfactory results of a
              sentic session. In addition, there is the satisfaction of
              finding that one can summon up various emotions at will.
              This creates a condition of sentic fluidity --- as
              compared with the rigidity found in emotional
              disturbances. </p>
            <p align="left">Whatever their cause, the beneficial effects
              of sentic cycles have many applications. In fantasizing
              emotions one experiences relief from daily emotional
              tensions. Fearful or anxious persons have reported that
              sentic cycles help relieve their symptoms. </p>
            <p align="left">Psychiatrist Alfred P. French and Joe Tupin
              have found that sentic cycles provide "immediate and
              dramatic relief of symptoms of depression", in some
              patients. Other researchers have evidence that they may
              also relieve psychosomatic disorders, perhaps because
              during sentic cycles one naturally expresses emotions that
              might otherwise be shunted to various parts of the system
              causing long-term internal stress. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Touch</b> --- After experience with
              sentic cycles, one comes to appreciate the language of
              touch: he becomes more sensitive to the emotional signals
              in another person’s touch, and more aware of the emotions
              he communicates through his own touch. </p>
            <p align="left">Learning to express and control emotions in
              the way I have described may help drama and music students
              learn to be better, more convincing communicators.
              Feedback in the form of tracings can show them when their
              expressions approach the true sentic form. The
              measurements might shed light on what we call natural
              talent. </p>
            <p align="left">Training a person to express fantasy
              emotions in this manner, to be in touch with the spectrum
              of emotions, may help in the treatment of emotionally
              disturbed, neurotic, or psychopathic personalities. It
              also seems to lend itself to rechanneling of
              anxiety-driven aggressiveness to a creative energy, in
              which the expressive act itself gives satisfaction. We
              should be able to learn more about the basic human
              emotions, and perhaps someday, possibly with help from
              geneticists, discover new ones better than we have yet
              experienced. Indeed the experience of the sentic cycle
              itself is a step in this direction. </p>

            <p align="left"><b>Abstract</b> --- Dynamic forms, called
              sentic forms, are described as language elements of a
              natural, biologically evolved language of communicating
              and generating emotions. These forms are genetically
              programmed into the central nervous system, and can be
              stored and recognized by computers and robots, and can
              serve as basis of real time emotional communication
              between them and humans. Music and art also utilize these
              forms to store and embody emotional meaning. A
              double-stream theory of music is outlined - including two
              principles of unconscious musicality which can realised on
              a computer - allowing one to create first-rate meaningful
              interpretations without manual performance or dexterity.
              New social opportunities and dangers are discussed arising
              from simulation and virtual reality which may exceed the
              average human in emotional eloquence. Real-real time is
              introduced as a concept to include human
              timeconsciousness. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>I. INTRODUCTION</b> </p>
            <p align="left">This paper is a short review of new thinking
              and practical applications arising from the discovery and
              study of time-forms and their biologically evolved
              meanings in communicating and generating emotion. </p>
            <p align="left">In communicating between men and machines,
              the use of discursive symbols has been general practice.
              Symbols come in two kinds: discursive and nondiscursive
              [1]. Discursive symbols have one-to-one relationship with
              what they denote. In non-discursive symbols human
              imagination is brought into play; such a symbol can act to
              evoke meanings and indirectly feelings. It used to be
              thought that music and the arts made use largely of such
              non-discursive symbols [1,2,3]. </p>
            <p align="left">A major step forward was achieved in
              realizing that the evolution of nature has designed
              specific dynamic forms which act not in a symbolic way but
              directly on the central nervous system. [4,5,6] These
              forms, like laughter and yawning, require no symbolic
              translation. They constitute the "words" of a natural
              language of emotional communication. Over two decades of
              studies have been devoted to isolate these forms and
              elucidate their function [7,8,9,10,11] </p>
            <p align="left">Human communication systems use zeros and
              ones, or dots and dashes, to transmit information. But
              nature's own emotion communication system has codesigned
              the sender, receiver, and message units with meaning
              evolved by nature: the message units themselves (the
              sentic forms) have analog form which act like keys in
              locks of our nervous system. </p>
            <p align="left">The specific dynamic forms - "words" - are
              produced through appropriate, prewired modulation by the
              sender, as analog forms. The receiver has demodulation
              filters that recognise these forms, like keys in locks. In
              our brain, the amygdala, a special structure of the
              midbrain, acts as a "gatekeeper" both to modulate and
              demodulate the specific dynamic forms, or "words"[12].
              Several output-input modes may be chosen for this process,
              moreover: the auditory, visual, tactile or motor systems.
            </p>
            <p align="left">The biologically evolved communication
              system inherently encodes and decodes emotional meaning -
              with specific dynamic forms (in the range of 1-10 sec
              duration). Without this remarkable symbiotic design, we
              would exist in emotional isolation. Through it we can
              touch one another emotionally in the present: we can share
              our emotions in our stream of life, and outside this
              stream through art and music. </p>
            <p align="left">This auto- and cross-communication system a
              has developed its own vocabulary. There is a class of
              qualities of experience which can be communicated
              inherently by specific dynamic forms and are contagious.
              These may be regarded as basic emotions. The emotional
              quality is transmitted from one individual to the other,
              in whom it is generated in turn. Such transmitting of
              emotional qualities may be observed in animals also (cf.
              innate release mechanisms), in the behavior of flocks or
              herds. In humans it may be seen for example, in crowd
              behavior, political oratory by demagogues, concerts of
              music, theatre, as well as in intimate behavior. </p>
            <p align="left">The basic dynamic forms, called sentic
              forms, may be evident in a gesture, in a tone of voice, in
              a musical phrase or dance step. It is the character of the
              form, not the particular output modality that determines
              its emotional meaning. We have isolated the dynamic forms
              for a number of emotions especially, anger, hate, grief,
              love, sex, joy, and reverence [4,5,6]. Like laughter and
              yawning these forms themselves appear to be largely
              universal and can not be arbitrarily learned - one can
              only discover what is already there inherently,
              "hard-wired". </p>
            <p align="left">Societies differ in the degree of
              suppression, the frequency of use, and the choice of
              output modality for communicating these emotional
              qualities using their biologically given dynamic forms . </p>
            <p align="left"><b>Precision of Dynamic Form</b> </p>
            <p align="left">A consequence of the biologic design of
              key-lock relationship is that the power of transmission
              becomes a function of the precision with which the form is
              realized. A deviation from the biologically designed form
              will tend to diminish its power to generate the emotion.
              If the deviation is sufficiently large, no recognition
              will take place at all - the key will not fit. </p>
            <p align="left">An interesting question is raised as a
              consequence: what kind of distortions are acceptable to
              the process, and what kind of distortions suppress the
              emotional meaning? This becomes one of the central
              questions to elucidate in a theory of emotional language
              transmission. Jamming of the emotional quality in the
              transmission process may be produced by one class of
              distortions, but not by another. Thus, the concepts of
              noise and of signal to noise ratio need to be looked at in
              a different light from that of man- made transmission
              systems. A new kind of mathematics needs to be developed
              that can distinguish between interfering and
              non-interfering types of distortion and noise. </p>
            <p align="left">The gain of the transmission of emotionally
              meaningful form is a form function. The degree of the
              perfection of the form governs the power of generation. It
              is therefore not sufficient to have a form that is
              conventionally 'similar' to a desired expressive quality.
              It is necessary to redefine the meaning of 'similar' in
              this context. </p>
            <p align="left">Such a form could be a caricature, and can
              also be perceived as mimicking. Mimicry may be useful when
              no real emotion communication is desired [7,9], i.e. no
              real-real time emotion communication (for the meaning of
              real-real time, see later in this paper). Then the form
              merely acts to remind a person of the emotional quality in
              a relatively "untouching" way. If one wants to have
              genuine emotional communication, the forms need to be
              precisely realized. These forms thus operationally define
              what we sense as a 'sincere' or "from the heart"
              expression of emotion. The conditions for this are
              biologically given. </p>
            <p align="left">Therefore by simply being faithful to this
              precision of dynamic form we can achieve a mode of
              communication between man and machine, and between machine
              and man, which will be felt as not machine-like. </p>
            <p align="left">(That function defines as well exaggeration
              which also acts as impediment to 'sincere' sharing.) </p>
            <p align="left">A human tends to be very quickly seduced to
              project an entity into a machine that communicates in this
              way. One needs in fact to develop a resistance to avoid
              being "sucked in". Continuing and varied interaction
              between man and machine with truly expressive gestures and
              tones of voice on the part of the machine, or of genuine
              musical expressiveness, make it mountingly difficult to
              maintain one's awareness that it is "only a machine". </p>
            <p align="left">As it is increasingly becoming possible, by
              incorporating the dynamic forms now known to be truly and
              'sincerely' expressive of specific emotional qualities, to
              program a machine to interact with the human so that the
              expressions are experienced as not being machine-like but
              "living", we need therefore to look as far as we can now,
              with some urgency, to consider the differences between a
              man and such a machine - especially emotionally. </p>
            <p align="left">Anyone who has seen the newest little toy
              dogs walk, jump and beg may have had the almost
              irresistible response to feel: "isn't he cute!" Applying
              that paradigm to the far more sophisticated dialogues and
              simulations that are possible with this new knowledge, it
              is not hard to realize that we will need to 're-arm'
              ourselves emotionally to maintain our human identity. This
              will not be easy to do because we are biologic prisoners
              of those forms, and cannot escape the feelings of
              livingness associated with the spontaneous production of
              such forms, and especially the more so in dialogue. </p>
            <p align="left">It is not so much the ability of such a
              machine to "think" that would cause this problem, but the
              implied and varied feelings which it would express so
              well. The emphasis is on so well . It becomes an artistic
              achievement, so to speak, to program a machine so that it
              communicates in emotionally meaningful dynamic forms,
              indistinguishible from those produced by humans - and by
              humans moreover who are most effective in their emotional
              communication. </p>
            <p align="left">Until now, it has been the province of great
              art to provide a "living" storage of emotionally
              meaningful form. The great performer of music Pablo Casals
              could express more emotional meaning in shaping one single
              note than another performer perhaps in an entire concert.
              Inwardly perceived first, the high resolution of time-form
              required in all the variables concerned in producing the
              musical meaning and sound, was the province of his art. </p>
            <p align="left">That power of pure biologic form,
              transferred into a computer and machine can potentially
              result in more powerful communication of emotional
              qualities than the average human can produce most of the
              time. </p>
            <p align="left">This is a prospect that we need to face as
              the Pandora's box of sentic forms is now open. Society
              needs to learn to use them in new creative ways (see
              footnote 1) and to live with their now conscious knowledge
              - as well as with the results produced by ever-better
              "mechanization" of incorporating these living forms in
              dead machines. Looking at a mannequin may intrigue us to a
              degree. But when that mannequin can variously and
              expressively converse with us and even sing with more
              eloquent and "living" dynamic shapes than most humans can
              produce, our feelings towards the mannequin will change
              almost irresistably. To force ourselves to regard such a
              "living" mannequin as a machine may after a while tend to
              make us wary of real humans to whom we might tend to apply
              the same filter, as if they were such mannequins. This, if
              successful, would recreate an isolation and alienation
              from which nature had rescued us millions of years ago
              when it developed these very forms. If we cannot trust
              these forms any more, what can we trust? </p>
            <p align="left">A new kind of emotional education will be
              required. We know too little yet to be able to say how
              such new emotional communication will turn out. </p>
            <p align="left">The most difficult programming eventually
              will be to incorporate true empathy, as distinct from
              sympathy, in the dynamic expressions of the machine [see
              7, 9 for distinctions between empathy and sympathy]. Such
              expressions are not commonly found in theatre. They need
              to be based on a knowledge that the machine has of the
              human that far exceeds the current question the machine is
              being asked; they need to be based on insight which
              comprises his potentiality. Once that is achieved however,
              it will be very difficult to avoid feeling an entity, a
              benevolent, perhaps even loving entity within the machine.
            </p>
            <p align="left">Conversely, a hostile, malevolent persona
              can be programmed, for purposes that may be devilish, or
              perhaps merely protective against intrusion. </p>
            <p align="left">Personality structure could in fact
              eventually be introduced which would govern the types of
              emotional responses produced in specific dialogue and
              situations. </p>
            <p align="left">Furthermore, even the personality structure
              could be altered (or switched) in response to different
              questioners , in a preprogrammed way, so that "strangers",
              for example may be treated entirely differently from
              "friends", within a whole field of discourse. This could
              be experienced as two (or more than two) different people
              residing in the machine. And these different personalities
              could even function simultaneously, from the same machine,
              independently of one another - being friendly, and
              hostile, and indifferent simultaneously to different users
              or customers! </p>
            <p align="left">It thus becomes increasingly important to
              attempt to elucidate the real distinctions between man and
              machine, especially in view of </p>
            <p align="left">1) the largely prevelant concept that
              increasing complexity of machines might be the required
              prelude to their becoming conscious and </p>
            <p align="left">2) the ability of computers and machines to
              simulate not just human thinking but emotional
              communication in the biological language devised by nature
              with a precision and power that will not merely equal that
              of humans but may exceed it. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>TIME FORMS</b> </p>
            <p align="left">The central nervous system has evolved the
              capacity to perceive transient time forms with great
              precision - an ability that is used in the communication
              of emotional qualities. Because of the transient nature of
              these forms they rarely receive recognition in human
              language by specific words (some exceptions: sigh,
              caress). Nevertheless they represent real entities to the
              nervous system, as do visible objects which are frequently
              named. The time forms concerned are in the general range
              of about 1 to 10 seconds, and the precision may be as high
              as 1 part in 500. Small changes in the transient form
              affect the meaning. The dynamic forms behave in parametric
              space like functions with a number of troughs or minima
              (solutions for the parametric values for which the forms
              are most powerful (singularities)) separated by saddle
              regions. As the shape changes from its optimal form, by
              varying the parameters, it becomes gradually less
              meaningful and powerful. If we transform the form
              gradually from one basic emotion to another, it first
              becomes meaningless before it starts to express the second
              emotion. The dynamic forms for specific emotions may thus
              be described as islands of meaning in a sea of
              meaninglessness. </p>
            <p align="left">The parametric description of such forms
              associated with its meaning and the effect of distortions
              requires a new mathematical treatment, or a new kind of
              mathematics for its appropriate representation. We have
              described [6,7] the averaged expressive forms for each of
              the emotions studied in terms of Laplace transforms as
              responses to unit impulses as follows: </p>
            <p align="left">While this description gives a good
              representation of the transient form it does not portray
              the changes in meaning and in the power of communication
              as the form changes. We are presently working on a
              mathematical formulation that can reflect this important
              part of its natural behavior. It can be said that
              techniques of least square differences and other currently
              used curve-fitting approaches are not suitable for this. <br>

            <p align="left"><b>PROPERTIES OF SENTIC TIME FORMS</b> </p>
            <p align="left">We may list the remarkable properties of
              these dynamic forms, that act as multiple body-mind
              windows [25], and their action in the central nervous
              system as follows: </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Its power of communication
              depends on its faithfulness to the characteristic form. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. There is a one-to-one correspondence
              between the quality to be expressed and the particular
              dynamic form. There is an inherent coherence between
              meaning and dynamic form. This coherence is biologically
              determined and genetically conserved. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The expressive time forms are
              preprogrammed by the brain as single entities
              (trajectories) for each act of expression. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Iteration of the form tends to augment the
              intensity of the emotion state it generates over a certain
              number of repetitions to a peak from which intensity will
              recede with continued repetition. Repetition is most
              effective when it is not strictly predictable, i.e.not
              'mechanical', but rather when the intervals between
              repetitions vary somewhat, in an unpredictable,
              quasi-random manner. This variation is of the order of
              5-10% of the repetition rate. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Mixed, or compound emotions are expressed
              not through an algebraic addition of the expressions of
              the emotions of which it is composed, but through a
              telescoping of two separate expressions in time: the two
              component emotion expressions are seamlessly spliced
              somewhere in the middle (at a variable point). The
              expression of melancholy, for example, a compound emotion,
              begins with love, then is spliced to end in sadness. The
              love expression cannot complete itself and turns into a
              sadness expression, somewhere about half-way through the
              expression; however this is a single preprogrammed entity
              of 5-6 seconds duration, not two separate expressions. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Each emotion expression needs to be
              completed, otherwise a frustration is felt. Interupted
              expressions produce frustration regardless of whether they
              express positive or negative emotions. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Humans can express only one sentic form
              (single or compound, see 5 above) at any one time
              "sincerely" - regardless of which and how many output
              modes they may employ - ie. sentic expression is a single
              channel sytem. If several output forms are used
              simultaneously, they will tend to embody the same sentic
              expressive form. A human cannot, for example, express
              anger with the voice and love with a gesture
              simultaneously, and both sincerely. </p>
            <p align="left">A computer however is under no such
              restriction since for it "sincerity" is not bound to a
              single channel. </p>
            <p align="left">Different classes of distortions will be
              differently effective to degrade meaning. Some types of
              distortions are quite tolerable and affect meaning little.
              Other types are highly detrimental. It is important to be
              able to distinguish the different types of distortion. In
              the visual arts, for example, small missing gaps in lines
              can be readily supplied by the eye, or more precisely, by
              the central nervous system, while even small distortions
              in the shape of the lines will be felt as serious
              detriments. Similar distinctions apply to the dynamic
              forms. Thus, meaning suffers less from limitations of high
              frequency response between 10,000 and 20,000 Hz say, than
              through the effects of wow and flutter, and the relative
              shaping of individual musical phrases, i.e.
              sub-audiofrequencies. These sub-audiofrequencies (ie.
              transient shapes) are demodulated by the amygdala, a
              different brain structure than is involved in auditory
              perception per se. </p>
            <p align="left">While the effects of hi-fi have been greatly
              promoted, relatively little attention has been paid to the
              concept of fidelity of meaning. Within a relatively
              restricted frequency band it is yet possible to have a
              highly faithful rendition in regard to meaning, as well as
              a highly degraded one. Thus the tone of voice, for
              example, the minute timing and loudness inflections of the
              voice can carry vast ranges of meaning, even in a limited
              frequency domain. The extensions of the frequency band may
              change the range of meanings only comparatively little.
              (Arthur Schnabel's interpretations of Beethoven gained
              very little when the frequency response was improved from
              the 78 rpm reproductions). Even whispered speech can carry
              a large range of emotional meaning in its inflections. </p>
            <p align="left">There is thus a need to develop a more
              extensive theory of communication of qualities through
              dynamic forms [25]. The work which we have conducted over
              the last two decades attempts only to make a beginning in
              this. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>APPLICATIONS</b> </p>
            <p align="left">We have identified and isolated specific
              dynamic transient forms, called sentic forms, specific for
              each emotion, that naturally serve to auto- and cross-
              communicate basic human emotions, such as anger, love,
              grief, or sexual desire. They also serve to generate
              emotions through repeated expression. </p>
            <p align="left">These time domain forms are distinct from
              facial expression, which has been predominantly
              investigated by researchers in a static setting (though
              animation by film artists has been an active
              contribution). The forms work expressively in the various
              modes of spatio-temporal expression [26]. For example,
              they can communicate and generate emotion over the
              telephone as sound shapes, and through touch expression,
              gesture, dance, and music. </p>
            <p align="left">Measured through touch, sentographically
              (see footnote 2), they can be transformed into sounds
              expressing the same emotion conserving the dynamic form.
              Such expressive sounds derived from touch, have been
              tested on hundreds of subjects inter-culturally, and will
              be demonstrated. </p>
            <p align="left">Sentic forms can be stored in computers and
              used to modulate a variety of outputs which thereby become
              emotionally expressive. They can also be used to modulate
              the tone of voice. </p>
            <p align="left">The relation of dynamic form to meaning has
              also been most particularly studied in great detail with
              music. The microstructure of music has been shaped in
              accordance with meaningful forms so as to convert the dead
              notes of a score into living performances
              [13,14,15,16,17,21]. </p>
            <p align="left">The generating power of repeated expression
              of these forms have been used to create a sequence of
              emotions for an individual, each expressed repeatedly
              called sentic cycles, that has therapeutic benefits and
              benefits to well-being[7, 9, 18]. This programmed sequence
              of about half hour duration can also be stored on the
              computer, to guide the timing of expressions. The measured
              expressive shapes can also be stored, and displayed on the
              screen [19]. </p>
            <p align="left">Now that we know sentic forms, we can
              communicate with emotional meaning between man and
              computer, or robot, in the time domain. While the robot
              will not feel the emotion, it will be able to discriminate
              among emotions and in turn, send dynamic signals to humans
              in the biologically based language devised and used by
              nature in communicating and generating emotion - in
              sharing emotion among individuals. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>COMMUNICATION THROUGH TIME FORMS IN MUSIC</b>
            </p>
            <p align="left">In music the precision of time forms in
              communicating qualities is exemplified par excellence. It
              provides an excellent laboratory for the study of small
              changes in time form and their effects. </p>
            <p align="left">Time forms in music appear to function
              through two streams, simultaneously produced or perceived
              by the central nervous system. </p>
            <p align="left">One stream is the pulse, a repetitive
              phenomenon which is automatized after the first instance
              utilizing the property of the Central Nervous System we
              have called Time Form Printing. A dynamic form or movement
              of the order of one second duration may be repeated
              automatically by the nervous system without subsequent
              specific attention being paid to the form - we can put it
              into 'automatic repeat mode' by a simple act of will! For
              example, one may make a movement pattern with the arm say,
              in a triangular shape, or in an ellipse, and once begun,
              one may reiterate this pattern an indefinite number of
              times, without paying further attention to it. The shape
              of this movement will tend to be conserved throughout the
              repetitions. Stopping such a movement however, or changing
              it to a new form requires a momentary attention, to direct
              it to move with the new form; and it will then continue to
              repeat with the changed form, again without requiring
              further attention. While we do such a repetitive movement
              with the arm, we can talk and tell a story, a second
              stream, without one stream interfering with the other. </p>
            <p align="left">Such a two-stream process goes on in music
              and appears to be of the essence. In Western music of the
              late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the pulse seems
              to represent the intimate identity of who is telling the
              story, that is, the composer - as was noted by Becking
              [20]. Along with this repetitive stream there is a second
              stream, the unfolding emotional story of the music. The
              two streams are perceived in parallel. </p>
            <p align="left">Different styles of music emphasize the two
              streams differently. Rock and roll has mostly the pulse,
              Gregorian Chant mostly the story, classical music of the
              19th century a balance between the two. Notably, much of
              present day avant-garde music has lost the pulse as a
              separate stream. (This tendency seems to have originated
              to some degree with the impressionistic (vs.
              expressionistic) music of Debussy.) In folk music and most
              of ethnic music there also is a fine balance between the
              two streams. The pulse here expresses the ethnic identity,
              rather than the composer's, and the microstructure of the
              ethnic pulse appears to be related to the rhythmic fine
              structure of the spoken language. </p>
            <p align="left">In one of the great drawbacks of an
              otherwise toweringly invaluable music tradition, Western
              notated music is dead if performed as written. The musical
              thought of the composer cannot be notated in detail, only
              as a skeleton. The performer has to flesh out the skeleton
              with meaningful musical microstructure in order to
              re-create the living musical thought. </p>
            <p align="left">Two principles which convert the dead
              musical notes to living music have been discovered [12]. </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The Pulse, <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Predictive Amplitude Shaping. </p>
            <p align="left">Each applies to one of the streams
              described. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>1. The Hierarchic Pulse.</b> </p>
            <p align="left">The pulse is a repetitive combined time and
              amplitude warp applying throughout the music to groups of
              notes forming the pulse matrix, typically a group of four
              nominally equal notes. </p>
            <p align="left">We have determined the microstructure for
              the pulse for a number of composers as a pulse matrix
              combining specific time and amplitude warps
              [13,14,15,16,21,24]. This pulse matrix functions
              hierarchically on several levels, in a relatively
              attenuated mode for the higher levels. By applying the
              hierarchal pulse structure to a musical composition we can
              obtain performances of considerable quality and
              distinction in terms of musical meaning. Such a
              performance of Mozart's Sonata K330 will be demonstrated
              at this meeting. The attenuation levels at the various
              hierarchical levels and the hierarchical form of the pulse
              structure need to be chosen with musical judgment, for
              each composition. The pulse is therefore applied with
              musical judgment, not in a purely mechanized way. But the
              application of the pulse and the choice of parameters
              occurs generically to the entire piece. Of the several
              levels of the pulse, typically three, the lowest two are
              composer specific, the highest piece specific. For piano
              music the pulse alone can provide much of the musicality
              required to bring music to life. Other interpretive
              variables which need to be entered include the balancing
              of voices, specific dynamic indications prescribed by the
              composer in the score, micropauses at the boundaries of
              sections and occasionally elsewhere, choices of tempo, and
              of changes in general tempo. </p>
            <p align="left">Like the gait of a person, or handwriting,
              the pulse represents the unique personality of a composer
              and provides his 'point of view'. or 'presence'. It can be
              readily realized with MIDI. Pulse matrix values are now
              known for Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Schubert, Schumann,
              Mendelssohn and some other composers. The pulse is also
              highly applicable to popular music, enhancing its
              livingness. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>2. Predictive Amplitude Shaping</b> </p>
            <p align="left">The second, parallel, stream of the music
              process is the unfolding of the musical story as a chain
              of melody and is continually changing and developing as
              the story unfolds. In this stream the amplitude contour
              shape of each separate note contributes to the musical
              meaning. A singer, string player or wind player can and
              does shape each note distinctively and differently
              according to the musical meaning. How the amplitude
              envelope shapes of each note are related to the melodic
              structure was discovered and is described by the principle
              of Predictive Amplitude Shaping, a second principle
              underlying the microstructure of music. It too, describes
              an unconscious element of musical thought, involved in
              musicality, not notated. </p>
            <p align="left">Where musical instruments allow it, every
              tone of a piece of music is shaped differently according
              to expressive needs. In a good performance the shapes of
              the tones are by no means uniform, but what guides their
              shape has not been systematically described either by
              music interpreters or theorists. </p>
            <p align="left">By using computers to generate melodies
              using sinusoidal sound only, and varying the amplitude
              envelope shapes and the durations of the tones, a
              principle was discovered which we call Predictive
              Amplitude Shaping, which appears to mirror functions of
              musicality which govern the shapes employed in meaningful
              interpretations [13]. </p>
            <p align="left">This principle makes the amplitude shape of
              the present note deviate from a basic shape in a specific
              manner depending on what the next note is going to be. The
              envelope shape is skewed forward in proportion to the
              tangent of the pitch-time curve at that note. This means
              that the shape of the present note is skewed forward if
              the next note is going to be higher in pitch, and it is
              skewed backwards if the next note will be at a lower
              pitch, depending also on the time when the next note
              occurs. </p>
            <p align="left">The principle relates the shapes organically
              to melodic structure, so that the shape of the present
              tone implicitly presages what tone will follow. This gives
              a feeling of continuity and a continuity of feeling to the
              performance. It markedly enduces musicality into the
              phrasing of melodies, and appears to apply to melodies in
              general, i.e., it is not composer specific. The mean form
              however from which the skewing takes place seems to have
              composer-specific aspects. </p>
            <p align="left">In creating the shapes of envelopes for the
              amplitude of the musical tones we have departed from the
              industry standard of specifying attack, decay, sustain and
              release. These parameters were derived from the properties
              of a piano or keyboard tone, they reflect the musical
              machinery of a piano. We note however, that musical
              thought does not think in terms of such discontinuities.
              Rather, the musical thought of a tone is shaped as a
              continuous curve. Such continuous curves of amplitude
              contour are naturally produced by the human voice, string
              instruments, wind instruments, wherever the tone can be
              continously shaped. This ability is in fact a source of
              superiority of such instruments over the comparatively
              fixed amplitude contours produced by pianos (and even more
              so harpsichords and organs which cannot even readily
              accomodate the amplitude warps of the composers' pulse
              matrix - but not so the clavichord!). </p>
            <p align="left">The shapes of individual tones, and their
              range of variation in music can be largely described
              through only two parameters of a beta function [13,21]. We
              have used this method to calculate customized shapes for
              each tone based on the melodic structure, and the above
              principle. The basic shape from which skewing takes place
              applies to all notes, short or long (except for very long
              notes eg. pedalpoints). </p>
            <p align="left">These organically varied shapes seem to
              represent musical thought better the conventional methods.
              They make even scales sound more musical, and often result
              in phrasing as specially indicated by composers. </p>
            <p align="left">They relate to the inner gestures that
              govern the emotional expression of the music and allows
              the form of the music to correspond to the inner desired
              shape. </p>
            <p align="left">Vibrato structure and changes in timbre
              within each note can also be guided by related principles
              in an integral way, customizing every note. </p>
            <p align="left">This second principle shall be of great use
              especially in the next technologic generation. </p>
            <p align="left">It is not readily realised through MIDI, in
              contrast to the Hierarchic Pulse, but will be of great
              value in the next technologic generation for the general
              user to achieve living musicality. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>APPLICATIONS</b> </p>
            <p align="left">Both the pulse and predictive amplitude
              shaping can readily be incorporated into a computer
              program which can perform music in a living manner as a
              consequence, with emotional meaning as desired by the user
              of the program. This allows any user who has no manual
              dexterity from ages 8 to 80 to interpret great music using
              only their own sense of musicality. </p>
            <p align="left">Composers can now specifiy in a micorscore
              the way they wish their music to be performed. </p>
            <p align="left">Using these principles teaches one how to
              improve one's musicality in a profound and subtle way. It
              is a powerful pedagogic means. </p>
            <p align="left">The knowledge that we have obtained through
              the realization and application of these principles of
              unconscious musical thought, through computers, is
              significant to AI [27], to musicians and to the general
              public. In a sense it is the achievement of the virtual
              reality of the music performer - the simulation of music
              interpretation and performance, so that every smallest
              detail is known (through the global adjustment of the
              principles, using one's musicality. Less than 2 % of the
              notes need 'manual, individual' adjustment). It has
              implications also to the subtleties of rhythms and
              inflections of speech in conveying shades of emotional
              meaning. </p>
            <p align="left">Appendix A gives details of the
              demonstrations of its function, given as part of this
              presentation. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>EMOTIONAL COMMUNICATION WITH A COMPUTER
                OR ROBOT</b> </p>
            <p align="left"><b>TIME CONSCIOUSNESS: REAL-REAL TIME</b> </p>
            <p align="left">More than any sense perception, such as
              visual, auditory or tactile experience, time consciousness
              is intimately linked to consciousness. Without seeing,
              hearing, touching, or other sensory inputs, consciousness
              is still engaged with time consciousness. Mental events
              are ordered in time, apart from sensory inputs. One may
              think, for an obvious example, of a musical rhythm. The
              tempo of such a rhythm for a given meaning depends on our
              time consciousness. </p>
            <p align="left">Time consciousness has different aspects for
              short term, intermediate term and long term periods. In
              communicating emotions and qualities with dynamic forms we
              are concerned with shorter periods, times under 10
              seconds, as entities or units communicating of emotional
              meaning, and periods of the order of one hour for the
              experience of communicative structures ('stories') built
              from multiple units (e.g. a symphony). In these regions we
              have observed stabilities of timing of the order of one
              part in 500 [22, 23]. Such stable timing has been observed
              regardless of time of day, temperature of the environment,
              body temperature, including fever of 2-3 degrees above
              normal, and to a degree, variable acoustics. Studies of
              timings of performances of musical pieces well known to
              the performers on different occasions over several years
              have documented this. Experiments with tapping and
              mentally rehearsing portions of the same piece, over many
              years by the same person has illustrated similar stability
              [22]. </p>
            <p align="left">These findings suggest that if the intended
              meaning attributed to the musical piece does not change
              (i.e. the concept of the music is not altered), a high
              degree of stability is observed in the performance timing
              and consequently, we may say, in the individual rate of
              time consciousness. Moreover, that a particular piece of
              music, or dynamic expressive form, will tend to have
              similar meaning to different persons at a given tempo
              suggests that their relative time consciousnesses cannot
              be too widely different. One could conjecture at most
              differences of the order of 5% between individuals, but it
              could be considerably less than that. This rate of time
              consciousness does not appear to change with age over an
              adult lifetime, and may be even similar at an earlier age.
              Clearly, there are neurobiologic clocks operating in the
              brain which are involved in this stability, and most
              likely they are of molecular rather than neuronal
              character [23]. </p>
            <p align="left">A quite different aspect of our experience
              with time is found in relation to our sense of boredom and
              excitement. Here periods of the order of hours may seem
              relatively long, or short, depending on our engagement in
              activity and its degree of fascination. On this scale the
              experience of passage of time appears to be also highly
              age dependent: For a child an hour may seem an
              interminable period, especially when it is filled with an
              unwanted activity or condition. As one gets older an hour
              seems to shorten progressively, and days and weeks appear
              to go by considerably quicker, with a ratio for a sixty
              year old of perhaps as much as 3:1 compared with
              childhood. That this should happen although the time
              consciousness involved in the expression of dynamic
              expressive forms (eg. music) remains unchanged is very
              remarkable and appears to attest to the existence of
              different, less precise processes in this range. </p>
            <p align="left">A third aspect of time consciousness is
              found in the estimate of longer periods, of the order of a
              few hours to one day, and involve functions which make it
              possible, for example, to wake up at a specific time
              without the benefit of alarm clocks, simply by an act of
              will, i.e. a pre-determined period entered by the mind
              into itself. This ability does not seem to degrade with
              increasing age, and can also be remarkably precise. </p>
            <p align="left">In our memories experiences are ordered in
              time, both in short term memory and long term memory,
              although the method of tagging may well be different for
              each. (If one could not tell the order in time of two
              consecutive events, all thought, logical or otherwise
              would be impossible.) Thinking, like a computer program,
              is not reversible in time. Time consciousness is the only
              solid scientific evidence we have for the direction of
              time. Physical laws do not really define it (they work
              equally for both directions) and the laws of
              thermodynamics allow us only statistical inferences. (see
              footnote 3) </p>
            <p align="left">Furthermore, time consciousness occurs in
              the present. The contents of consciousness changes, or, we
              can say, the content of the present changes, but the
              present (itself) remains the same, unchanging. </p>
            <p align="left">Physicists have brainwashed us into a habit
              of regarding time as a straight line, going from left to
              right in which the present is considered as a mathematical
              point which moves along this line at an unspecified rate.
              It is, in fact, meaningless to physics to ask what the
              rate of movement of this point is, along the line. What
              events take place are described by a change from T1 to T2
              ("as T goes from T1 to T2"!). The present does not enter
              at all. Physics cannot deal with the present. </p>
            <p align="left">But the past is gone and the future is not
              yet here. All that is here is the present. Physics gives
              us an insufficient view of what exists, leaving out the
              present - which is all that really exists - and in which
              the eternal (ie.at some level unchanging) laws of physics
              operate. </p>
            <p align="left">But not so, time consciousness. Through it
              we are aware of the present moment and may distinguish it
              from both the past and the future. How it does that is
              unknown. We can say, however, that time consciousness is
              entirely relative to the species in which it is found.
              This relativity of time consciousness has nothing to do
              with the theory of relativity. It concerns rather the
              concept that individuals from a different galaxy might for
              example experience time in such a way that for them, night
              and day might appear as a flicker. Or, a fly on earth may
              well have a different time consciousness from a human.
              There is nothing absolute about time consciousness. </p>
            <p align="left">For a stone which may be assumed to have no
              time consciousness, it has no meaning to say that a given
              time period is either long or short. Thus, a billion years
              for a stone are not long and a microsecond not short, as
              it has no time consciousness. </p>
            <p align="left">For simplicity we propose that we denote
              human real time as real-real time when considering
              communicating with computers and robots. </p>
            <p align="left"><b>HOW DO COMPUTERS AND ROBOTS EXIST IN
                TIME?</b> </p>
            <p align="left">Clearly, computers and robots have no time
              consciousness. If and when they do acquire time
              consciousness, this would have to be especially engineered
              to be scaled according to human time consciousness or
              real-real time, for compatibility with humans. Materially,
              a computer is not essentially different from a stone.
              Unlike a stone, however, it operates with a succession of
              logical operations. Each operation is actually carried out
              between the ticks of the computer clock. Changing the rate
              of the computer clock, or even making it uneven has no
              effect on the outcome of its calculations. The numbers by
              which successive operations are given time tags are no
              different from any other series of numbers which the
              computer may store and handle. </p>
            <p align="left">At each tick of a computer clock the
              computer is in fact totally stationary as far as its
              calculating functions are concerned. It is, in fact,
              "dead". Only between ticks does it actually "work". And
              here the time taken is not known, and does not enter into
              the picture as long as its fast enough so it can be
              completed before the next tick occurs. </p>
            <p align="left">How does the computer therefore relate to
              the present? </p>
            <p align="left">Can we consider the computer to operate
              according to the image of time which we have learned from
              physicists? Its activities may be considered to span a
              period of from T1 to T2. The result of the calculation
              depends only on the sequence of logical operations or
              instructions carried out and is itself totally independent
              of how long it might have taken to complete them. </p>
            <p align="left">When a computer operates in real time it
              harmonizes the sampling rate of input and output so as to
              reproduce or produce output behavior corresponding to the
              physical changes which it attempts to model. Its
              calculations merely have to be fast emough to keep up with
              the sampling rate. </p>
            <p align="left">It is not concerned with human time
              consciousness nor that of any other species, nor with the
              human experience of the present. </p>
            <p align="left">But when a computer performs a time-form
              such as emotionally expressive music or speech, its real
              time operations need to reflect the real-real time
              experience of humans. In that domain a 1% difference in
              the time scale will already noticeably alter meaning. A
              10% change is a considerable change for the meaning of
              music, for example. In speech a 10% change will not change
              the meaning of the words but will alter the effectiveness
              of the emotional "overtones" which the message carries.
              Accordingly therefore when communicating emotional
              qualities to humans the computer cannot choose its own
              convenient scaling but must match the output to human time
              consciousness, or real-real time. This requirement is
              unnecessary when a computer prints out verbal messages or
              presents visual information such as emotionally expressive
              faces, for example, as long as those faces are not in
              expressive motion. </p>
            <p align="left">Departure from real-real time results in the
              emotional qualities acquiring a Mickey Mouse character.
              They are still recognizable as representing particular
              emotional qualities, but lose most of their emotional
              impact. To understand this better we need to consider that
              the emotions as transmitted by these dynamic forms, which
              we have called sentic forms, also contain and imply
              cognitive substrates . Thus, we have shown experimentally
              that with the feeling of love, there is an openess and
              guilelessness as part of the inherent biological program
              [11]. Even a small lie effectively blocks the experience
              of love at that time. Similarly, grief affects memory
              function: the ability to learn, and short term memory are
              diminished by the feeling of grief, and the consequent
              loss of interest in interaction with the environment. The
              cognitive substrates are the first to disappear when the
              dynamic forms are distorted [24]. Thus the Mickey Mouse
              characteristics imply that the emotions denoted are robbed
              of their cognitive substrates. But it is precisely the
              cognitive substrates that provide the elements of
              profoundity which may be experienced through really true
              emotional expressions and of its sequences. Thus a piece
              of music may seem profound not merely because it contains
              a sequence of emotions but because the sequence of
              emotions implies a series of cognitive substrates which
              give it a widely and deeply probing story. </p>
            <p align="left">In the use of computers and robots to
              communicate emotions to humans, one therefore has a choice
              to communicate merely signs a la Mickey Mouse or to
              represent genuine, "sincere" human expressions and
              emotions. The particular applications will decide which
              approach may be more appropriate. If it is decided to use
              "sincere" expressions we have then the power in real-real
              time to make these expressions more powerful and more
              convincing than the average human would tend to produce
              under most average conditions. We have at our fingertips
              the knowhow to make these expressions powerfully
              communicative, contagious, and seductive in the manner of
              the very best that any human can do. (see footnote 4) We
              can optimize it beyond the abilities of the average human:
              we can optimize it to the degree of which our most
              powerful art is capable. Whether we chose to do so and for
              what reasons and needs, surely will comprise a new branch
              of social ethics which badly needs to be developed. </p>
            <p align="left">One positive way of using the new powers
              opened up by this Pandora's Box opened by the findings of
              our research is to provide great musical performances. How
              this can be done we will attempt to demonstrate with a
              performance of the Mozart Sonata K330, which will be
              brought into conjunction with the best available
              performances on CD by great artists for the first time.
              That this can be done now is only the first step in an
              endeavor that has many further possibilities, not easy to
              fathom. </p>

              Appendix B </p>
            <p align="left"><b>A Short Note on the Development of
                Consciousness</b> </p>
            <p align="left">In the context of this paper some remarks on
              the natural development of consciousness may be permitted.
              Experience of emotion is not possible without
              consciousness. Also, sensory experience, such as red for
              example, has continuity in time, and stability over long
              time (in addition to its unique quality), which are so far
              difficult to ground on the discontinuous events in time
              and in space of the multiple neuronal events accompanying
              the experience. Accordingly some thoughts on how
              consciousness may have arisen in nature may be assayed, in
              view of our developing knowledge of molecular biology. As
              a newly evolved phenomenon, it is of such importance that
              it seems not unlikely that its potentiality is provided
              for in the laws of nature, ie. that like water, say, it
              appeared in the evolution of the universe not as a total
              surprise. Contrary to a prevelant view according to which
              consciousness is deemed to become possible only when
              complexity increases to a sufficiently high degree, i.e.
              that consciousness is essentially complexity- related, the
              author puts forward a different view of what may be
              required for consciousness to arise. This approach is
              outlined briefly here, and will be described elsewhere
              more fully. </p>
            <p align="left">In exploring such a view, one should also
              consider the pervasive unconscious mental functioning,
              dreaming, and especially the unexplored questions of the
              boundaries between the unconscious and the autonomic, and
              whether unconscious mental function predates
              consciousness. </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. <i>Content of Consciousness</i>
              --- Humans are able to see, hear, smell and touch
              simultaneously without notable interference of one sensory
              experience with the other. This defines in size, and in
              also complexity, a minimum capacity of consciousness even
              without considering other mental functions. </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Animals, even relatively
              primitive animals, appear to share this capacity of
              consciousness with humans in that they too can
              simultaneously see, hear, smell, touch and so on.
              Moreover, many primitive animals can sense some of these
              variables with higher resolution than can humans.
              Consequently, with regard to these functions one cannot
              take the view that animals have a smaller capacity of
              consciousness. The argument that such animals have no
              consciousness at all and act as reflex automatons is
              rejected (animals clearly appear to make decisions based
              on their sensory experience involving many of these
              variables, aneasthetics are used to eliminate
              consciousness in these animals, etc.). </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. One of the earliest
              qualities of experience developed in evolution is hunger.
              Experience of hunger - a remarkable "invention" of nature,
              replaced chemotaxis and served as a fount of knowledge for
              the animal concerning what to eat, when to eat, and how
              much to eat - all of which is encapsulated in the
              experiential entity, "hunger". But hunger, as well as
              experience of sexual attraction which also developed at an
              early stage, can exist and function only if there is
              consciousness. </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. It is suggested therefore as
              plausible that consciousness itself may have developed
              through newly evolved genes at a relatively low stage of
              evolution. It would be supposed that these genes for
              consciousness produce certain proteins or other gene
              products which cause consciousness in the brain. According
              to this view, it is thus not complexity per se but these
              specific genes that would account for the emergence of
              consciouness in evolution. (If this is so, the capacity
              for being a little bit conscious would appear somewhat
              like a little bit pregnant.) </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As progress
              is being made in the human genome project it is possible
              that such genes for consciousness could be identified in
              decades to follow. As we share so may of our genes with
              animals we may also share such consciousness creating
              genes with them. </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. In achieving consciousness
              through the interaction of proteins and other gene
              products in a totally unknown way it could be that a
              physical law would be invoked which is as yet unknown - a
              law which would in effect provide for the establishment of
              a Leibnitzian monad, as a result of specific molecular
              interaction. This kind of creation of one from many,
              similar to the creation of the oneness of the molecule
              from so many atoms (the potentiality of which preexists,
              predictable through the laws), and in some ways in effect
              reminescent of a field which at any one point
              automatically and necessarily summates the effects of many
              contributing sources in space, but obeying relationships
              as yet quite unknown would seem, according to this view,
              to be necessarily involved in the phenomenon of
              consciousness. </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly,
              machines that do not possess the gene functions for
              consciousness would not become conscious no matter how
              complex they might become. </p>
            <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not
              preclude that those effective gene functions might be
              reproduced by an alternative molecular realisation, so
              that consciousness could then also be produced by a
              different configuration of matter than in natural
              evolution on this planet. But that would depend on the
              specific nature of the interaction and functions; it could
              also be that the solution realised by nature which we
              observe on earth is the only one possible. </p>

            <p align="left"><i>Footnote 1 --- </i>One such way is
              Sentic Cycles, a simple art form of touch leading to
              emotional balance and increased joy of living, which has
              been developed by the author[ 9, 7]. Touch ExPress(tm) is
              a self-contained hand-held version of the Sentic Cycle kit
              . </p>
            <p align="left"><i>Footnote 2</i> --- The sentograph is an
              instrument measuring transient pressure (or force, more
              precisely) in two dimensions independently; pressure of
              the middle finger is used for expressing the sentic forms,
              as voluntary actions ('voluntary' here is a technical term
              meaning deliberate, conciously initiated by an act of
              will, transmitted by the voluntary muscle system, just
              like the movement of the arm in throwing a ball to hit a
              target.) </p>
            <p align="left"><i>Footnote 3</i> --- When we see a car
              moving say at about 20 miles an hour, or a person walking,
              ie. at moderate speeds we do not see a series of
              stroboscopic pictures, nor a blurred image, and we can
              estimate the speed of the car, yet a camera will either
              show it still if the shutter speed is fast enough, or with
              a blur. From a single photo we can judge the speed only
              from the degree of blur. We cannot tell directly from a
              sharp photo whether the object is moving or not. (Nor can
              physics tell the momentum of an object from an
              instantaneous view-apart from the relativity contraction,
              it will look just like a stationary object.) The human
              (and an animal, probably) does it without the need for
              blurring (blurring occurs only at higher speeds, exceeding
              the system's capacity), using his or her time
              consciousness-through a perceptual quality, aided by
              ratesensitive receptors that are submerged from the
              successive images that would appear on a photograph. Thus
              he can tell the direction of movement, and so of time,
              without needing a blur, nor multiple images. How much can
              we still learn about dataprocessing from nature! </p>
            <p align="left"><i>Footnote 4</i> --- People with the
              clinical condition of hypomania often have an abnormally
              effective and powerful production of sentic forms in
              speech and gesture; this helps them to convince and seduce
              others - specific biochemical causes of this heightened
              expressity are not known. </p>
