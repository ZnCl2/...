      <p>A computerized system into which is fed the nominal values of a
        musical
        score, the system acting to process these values with respect to
        the
        relative
        loudness of different tones in a succession thereof, changes in
        the
        duration
        of the tones and other deviations from the nominal values which
        together
        constitute the microstructure of the music notated by the score.
        The
        system
        yields the specified tones of the score as modified by the
        microstructure,
        thereby imparting expressivity to the music that is lacking in
        the
        absence
        of the microstructure.</p>

    <blockquote><b><i>Description</i></b>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>Field of Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to a technique for
        manipulating
        the
        nominal notation values of a musical score with respect to the
        amplitude
        contour of individual tones, the reactive loudness of different
        tones,
        slight changes in tone duration and other deviations from the
        nominal
        values
        which together constitute the expressive microstructure of
        music. More
        particularly, the invention deals with a computerized system
        capable of
        manual or automatic operation for impressing an expressive
        microstructure
        on a musical score inputted therein in terms of nominal
        notational
        values,
        the system being usable for composing music that includes
        microstructure. </p>
      <p>Music has been defined as the art of incorporating intelligible
        combinations
        of tones into a composition having structure and continuity. A
        melody
        is
        constituted by a rhythmic succession of single tones organized
        as an
        aesthetic
        whole. The standard system of notation employs characters to
        indicate
        tone,
        the duration of a tone (whole, half, quarter, etc.) being
        represented
        by
        the shape of the character and the pitch of each tone by the
        position
        of
        the character and the pitch of each notation, a melody is a
        musical
        line
        as it appears on the staff when viewed horizontally. </p>
      <p>While the notation of a musical score gives the nominal values
        of
        the
        tones, in order for a performer to breathe expressive life into
        the
        composition,
        he must read into the score many subtilties or nuances that are
        altogether
        lacking in standard notation. Some expressive subtilties are
        introduced
        as a matter of accepted convention, but most departures from the
        nominal
        values appearing in the score depend on the interpretive power
        of the
        performer. </p>
      <p>Thus, a musical score, while it may indicate whether a section
        of
        the
        score is to be played loudly (forte) or softly (piano), does not
        generally
        specify the relative loudness of component tones either of a
        melody or
        of a chord with anything approaching the degree of
        discrimination
        required
        by the performer. The performer decides for himself how loudly
        specific
        notes are to be played to render the music expressive. </p>
      <p>Even more important to an effective performance is the
        amplitude
        contour
        of each tone in the succession thereof. To satisfy musical
        requirements,
        the amplitudes of the tones must be individually shaped. Though,
        in
        general,
        amplitude contours are completely unspecified in standard
        notation,
        each
        performer, such as a singer or violinist who has the freedom to
        shape
        tones,
        does so in actual performance to impart expressivity thereto.
        Indeed,
        with
        those instruments that lend themselves to tone shaping,
        variations in
        the
        amplitude shapes of the tones constitute a principal means of
        expression
        in the hands of an expert performer. </p>
      <p>Another factor which comes into play in the microstructure of
        music
        are subtle deviations from the temporal values prescribed in the
        score.
        Thus, in actual performance, to avoid temporal rigidity which
        dehumanizes
        music, the performer will in actual practice amend the nominal
        duration
        values indicated by standard notation. These nominal values are
        arithmetic
        ratios of simple whole numbers such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/16, etc.
      </p>
      <p>Yet another expressive component of music which is unspecified
        in
        the
        score is the timbre to be imparted to each tone; that is, the
        harmonic
        content thereof. A performer of a string instrument, by varying
        the
        pressure
        and velocity of the bow on the string, can give rise, not only
        to
        variations
        in the loudness of the tone, but also variations in its tonal
        timbre
        independently
        of loudness. On a wind instrument, the performer can achieve
        similar
        effects
        by changes in lip pressure and wind velocity. </p>
      <p>In short, the macrostructure of a musical composition is
        defined
        in
        the score by standard notation. If, therefore, one executes this
        score
        by being assiduously faithful to its macrostructure, the
        resultant
        performance,
        however expertly executed, will be bereft of vitality and
        expression.
        The
        term "microstructure" as used herein encompasses all subtle
        deviations
        from the nominal values of the macrostructure in terms of
        amplitude
        shaping,
        timing, timbre and all other factors which impart expressiveness
        to
        music. </p>
      <p>It has been found that the measure of expressivity that can be
        attained
        using only sinusoidally-generated tones whose amplitude is
        shaped is
        quite
        surprising, despite the absence of harmonics which enrich the
        tones.
        Our
        ears appear to be highly sensitive to changing amplitudes and
        shapes,
        and
        our memories can effortlessly detect relative amplitudes and
        amplitude-shapes
        sounded in sequence in a musical context, even when the
        corresponding
        tones
        are sounded up to 10 or 15 seconds apart with many other tones
        in
        between. </p>
      <p>This faculty of short term memory for comparing tone amplitudes
        and
        tone shapes makes it possible for the typical listener to
        distinguish
        between
        identical forms that are mostly perceived as mechanical and
        monotonous,
        and slightly varying forms; for the latter, played even a few
        seconds
        apart,
        are perceived in relationship to one another and can produce
        varied
        meaning
        and vitality. Thus, the relationship which constitute the
        microstructure
        in music, though not explicit in the score, are vital to its
        appreciation. </p>
      <p>Essential also to an understanding of controllable
        microstructure
        in
        a system in accordance with the invention are A essentic forms;
        that
        is,
        the dynamic expressive forms of specific emotions; and B, the
        inner
        pulse
        of composers. These will now be separately considered. </p>
      <p>As explained in an article by Clynes and Nattheim (pp 47-82)
        included
        in Music, Mind and Brain: The Neuropsychology of Music, M.
        Clynes
        (ed.),
        Plenum Press, New York (1982), touch expressions of specific
        emotions
        such
        as love, grief and hate, can be transformed into sound
        expressions of
        like
        emotions; i.e., the nature of the transforms was found so that
        the
        sound
        expresses the same emotional quality as the touch expression
        from which
        it is transformed. </p>
      <p>The touch expressions are measured by recording the transient
        forms
        of finger pressure when these are voluntarily expressed. The
        instrument
        enabling this measurement to be made is called the Sentograph;
        it
        measures
        both the vertical and horizontal components of finger pressure
        independently
        as vector components varying with time. The sentographic forms
        obtained
        are stored in a computer memory and can be reproduced at will.
        (See
        Clynes
        U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,922, "System for Producing Personalized
        Sentograms"
        which discloses in greater detail the nature of essentic forms
        and how
        sentographs are produced.) </p>
      <p>In transforming the sentograms for touch expression of specific
        emotions
        into corresponding sound expressions it was found that the
        dynamic form
        (essentic form) of the touch was preserved to become the
        frequency
        contour
        of the sound. The sound is a frequency and amplitude modulated
        sinusoid.
        The amplitude modulation also was related to the dynamic touch
        form but
        needed to be passed through an imperfect differential network. </p>
      <p>These expressive sound shaped of "continuous" frequency
        modulation
        are
        related to melodies which represent a form of "discrete"
        frequency
        modulation.
        As spelled out in the above-identified Clynes and Nattheim
        article, it
        is possible to create musical melodies which express an
        emotional
        quality
        similar to dynamic, expressive sound forms in such a way that
        the
        melodic
        steps of the created melody act to outline the frequency contour
        of the
        "continuous" form, and the amplitude contour of the expressive
        sound is
        preserved. As different melodic steps are chosen, the durations
        would
        be
        constrained so as to conform to the "continuous" frequency
        modulation
        wave.
        (essentic form). </p>
      <p>The inner pulse of specific composers such as Beethoven, Mozart
        and
        Schubert, are expressed by sentographic forms obtained by having
        an
        individual
        think the music of a selected composer in his mind and by
        concurrently
        expressing the pulse by "conducting the music on a sentograph
        with
        finger
        pressure. The resultant sentograms indicate that major
        composers, such
        as those previously identified, impart individual pulse forms to
        their
        music which characterize their creativity identity or personal
        idiom.
        This
        inner pulse characteristic of each composer is, to a degree,
        analogous
        to individualistic brush strokes which distinguish one painter
        from
        another,
        regardless of the subject matter of their paintings. (See M.
        Clynes,
        "Sentics,
        The Touch of Emotions"- published by Doubleday - 1977.) </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>In view of the foregoing, the main object of this invention is
        to
        provide
        a computerized system for processing the nominal values of a
        musical
        score
        to impart an expressive microstructure thereto. </p>
      <p>More particularly, an object of the invention is to provide a
        system
        of the above type which is operable in a manual mode in which
        the
        values
        representing the microstructure are entered by the user, or in
        the
        automatic
        mode wherein microstructure values are calculated from a shaping
        function
        responsive to the melodic contour and by means of pulse matrices
        having
        certain values relating to the amplitude and duration of pulse
        component
        tones stored in the system. </p>
      <p>Among the significant advantages of a system in accordance with
        the
        invention is that it makes it possible to enliven a musical
        score and
        render
        it highly expressive, the system thereby acting to deepen the
        user's
        understanding
        and appreciation of music and its structure. </p>
      <p>Briefly stated, these objects are attained in a computerized
        system
        into which is fed the nominal values of a musical score, the
        system
        acting
        to process these values with respect to the amplitude contour of
        individual
        tones, the relative loudness of different tones in a succession
        thereof,
        changes in the duration of the tones and other deviations from
        the
        nominal
        values which together constitute the microstructure of the music
        notated
        by the score. The system performs the specified tones in the
        score as
        modified
        by the microstructure, thereby imparting expressivity to the
        music that
        is lacking in the absence of the microstructure. The
        microstructure may
        include changes in pitch or vibrato. </p>

      <p>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>Microstructure and Expressiveness </p>
      <p>Consideration will first be given to the extent to which
        detailed
        expressiveness
        is possible without vibrato and timbre, using only sinusoidal
        tones
        with
        individually-shaped amplitude envelopes, representing the notes
        of the
        music, with duration modification. Such amplitude modulation
        appears to
        be the most basic mode of dynamic expression and thus the
        understanding
        of this should precede the analysis of the expressive effects of
        vibrato,
        timbre and of timbre variation. It has been found that a
        significant
        degree
        of expressiveness is indeed possible with these very simple
        means, and
        that many of the subtlest nuances can be realized. </p>
      <p>In doing this, we shall also point out the relationship
        existing
        between
        the amplitude shapes of individual tones and the shape of the
        melody
        (i.e.
        essentic form). We shall show that a simple relationship holds
        between
        the shapes of individual tones of a melody and the form of its
        time
        course.
        Its shape within a continuum of upright ("assertive") and
        forward
        sloping
        ("plaintive") form is seen to be a function of the slope of the
        essentic
        form. (Assertive will hereafter be represented by the letter A
        and
        plaintive
        by the letter P) This means in practice that the shape of a tone
        is
        strongly
        and predictably influenced by the pitch of the next tone and by
        the
        time
        when it occurs. The shape of individual tones has a musically
        predictive
        function contributing to continuity, and thus, we may say, to
        musical
        logic. </p>
      <p>We shall also demonstrate how the individual pulse
        characteristics
        of
        a number of composers, in particular Mozart, Beethoven and
        Schubert,
        systematically
        modulate the pattern of tones both in amplitude and temporally,
        in
        characteristic
        ways which will be precisely given. In the course of these
        considerations
        we shall also outline how certain microstructure functions,
        involving
        durations,
        silences, and amplitude shapes, relate to various aspects of
        phrase and
        larger structure. </p>
      <p>Beta Function for Calculating Amplitude Shapes </p>
      <p>In order to produce convenient shapes for amplitude-modulating
        individual
        tones, we have used a mathematical means, briefly called the
        Beta
        Function.
        This term derives from a similar-named function in mathematic
        statistics.
        The Beta Function permits us to create a wide variety of shapes
        with
        the
        aid of only two parameters (P.sub.1 &amp; P.sub.2). It has a
        considerably
        wider applicable scope than the use of two exponential would
        have, for
        example. </p>
      <p>In electronic generation of musical sounds, it has heretofore
        been
        conventional
        to specify tones using parameters of rise time, decay time,
        sustain
        time,
        release time and final decay, or some subset of these. These
        parameters,
        natural to the electronic engineer, do not really have a musical
        function
        of like aptness. Amplitude shapes of musical tones often need to
        be
        convex
        rather than concave (or vice versa) in particular portions of
        their
        course
        (e.g., convex in their termination), and hardly ever have
        sustained
        plateaux.
        Moreover, separation of the termination of a tone into a decay
        and a
        release
        is generally the result of the mechanical properties of keyboard
        instruments
        and not a musical requirement. </p>
      <p>We have found that the varied rounded forms available through
        the
        Beta
        Function allow a simple and time-economical realization of the
        multitude
        of nuances of musical tone amplitude forms. Beta Function is
        defined
        as: </p>
      <p>x.sup.p.sbsp. (1-x) .sup.p.sbsp.2 for 0.ltoreq.x.ltoreq.1,
        Equation
        1 </p>
      <p>and is normalized for a maximum amplitude of 1 by dividing by a
        constant.
        ##EQU1## for a particular set of values of p.sub.1 and p.sub.2.
      </p>
      <p>p.sub.1, p.sub.2 have values .gtoreq.0. </p>
      <p>The resulting shape is multiplied by a parameter G to give the
        amplitude
        size of the particular tone. The shape stretches over a number
        of
        points
        determined by the duration of the tone. </p>
      <p>By choosing suitable values of p.sub.1 and p.sub.2, a shape may
        be
        selected
        from families of shapes such as the ones shown in FIGS. 1 to 6.
        Choosing
        the value 1 for both parameters gives rise to a symmetrical,
        rounded
        form,
        and 0.89 for both parameters produces a form very close to a
        sine half
        wave. Smaller values of p.sub.1 result in steeper rises; zero
        being a
        step
        function. Larger values than 1 for either p.sub.1 or p.sub.2
        make the
        curve
        concave, at the corresponding regions. A combination of zero and
        1
        results
        in a sawtooth. </p>
      <p>Most commonly used p values for musical tones generally lie
        within
        the
        region of 0.5 to 5, and most frequently in the region of 0.7 to
        2.
        Where
        required, a second or several more Beta Functions may be added
        to
        produce
        the desired shape--this is seldom necessary, however. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 1 to 4 illustrate different families of Beta Function
        shapes,
        showing some of the kinds of shapes readily obtained by choosing
        appropriate
        p.sub.1 and p.sub.2 values. In each group of curves, pairs of
        p.sub.1,
        p.sub.2 values are given starting from the leftmost curve.
        Maximum
        amplitude
        is normalized as 1. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 5 and 6 are Beta Function shapes illustrating degrees of
        skewness,
        starting from a symmetrical (1, 1) form, with pairs of p values
        forming
        a series as shown. These are types of shapes used for the
        amplitude of
        many musical tones (called A [left group] and P [right group]
        types). </p>
      <p>Computer Program for Shaping and Playing Melodies </p>
      <p>The Beta Function is used in a computer program that calculates
        individual
        tone shapes. In this program, the amplitude character of a tone
        is
        specified
        by three numbers, respectively denoting the amplitude magnitude
        G, and
        parameters p.sub.1 and p.sub.2. We use a linear scale for the
        magnitude
        with a resolution of 1 part in 4096. This in accordance with our
        findings
        that such transient sound phenomena may often be better
        understood by
        changes
        in amplitude on a linear rather than logarithmic scale. It also
        presents
        a visually more tractable aspect. Silences of various durations
        in the
        millisecond and centisecond range can also be readily inserted
        between
        tones. </p>
      <p>The duration of each tone is specified by the number of points
        it
        occupies
        over which the Beta Function is calculated. The calculation for
        each
        tone
        is done without affecting the duration and number of points of
        other
        tones.
        The temporal resolution of tones is usually better than 1
        millisecond.
        In practice, the amplitude contour may be constituted by a 12
        bit DA
        Converter
        and modulates a voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) of linearity
        better
        than 0.1% over a dynamic range of 1 to 4096. The frequency of
        the tones
        is set by another channel of a DA converter which modulates a
        voltage-controlled
        oscillator (VCO). </p>
      <p>In practice, the invention may be realized with D to A
        converters
        having
        8 to 16 bits. One may also use a digitally-controlled VCA and
        VCO which
        can, in effect, be integrated within a digital synthesizer, in
        which
        event
        there is no need for a D to A converter to operate the VCA and
        VCO. In
        that case, the ultimate sampling rate per channel must be 44 kHz
        or
        higher
        to obtain good quality results. </p>
      <p>The FORTRAN IV program was run on a PDP 11-23 computer. The
        tempo
        can
        be varied over a very wide range. Parameters of any tone can be
        readily
        varied and the changed result listened to in a few seconds,
        typically
        2-10
        seconds. Any desired portion of the music can be listened to.
        The
        maximum
        length of the piece to be played is only limited by the length
        of the
        microscore
        than can be stored on the disc. In practice, many tens of
        thousands of
        tones can be stored. </p>
      <p>Manually-Created Microstructure </p>
      <p>Before considering examples of manually-produced
        microstructures,
        some
        general comments may be appropriate. </p>
      <p>(i) It may take a musical person a day or two to perfect such a
        theme
        by gradually improving the values of the parameters, and
        repeatedly
        listening
        until it is refined to a degree where he no longer is sure what
        change
        would be an improvement. </p>
      <p>(ii) As one listens repeatedly and changes parameter values for
        a
        time,
        one eventually experiences satiation or lessening of sensitivity
        to
        particular
        aspects and/or the totality of the expression. It appears that
        one's
        sensitivities
        in this regard are dulled with repeated exposure, and need some
        time to
        recover, to regain their spontaneous freshness. A few minutes is
        sometimes
        sufficient, but after many hours of work, several hours or
        overnight
        may
        be required to revitalize one's listening. </p>
      <p>(iii) Working on a theme in this manner in fact sharpens one's
        hearing
        and attention to detail in regard to expressive qualities, and
        can be
        considered
        invaluable for that reason alone. </p>
      <p>(iv) A further phenomenon occurs as one continues working with
        a
        theme
        in this manner: the theme teaches one its own nature. As one
        repeatedly
        interacts, many new aspects relationships and meanings become
        clear.
        One
        becomes more and more involved with the theme, and it gains more
        vitality
        and clarity in one's mind. The goal becomes clearer; yet its
        form also
        develops as one works towards it. The process becomes
        self-refining, a
        systematic interaction with a stable limit; assymptotic and not
        seemingly
        finite, but stable. When one finally reaches the point of not
        being
        able
        to improve it any further, one feels this is not because it
        could not
        be
        improved, but rather that the required changes are so subtle,
        that
        greater
        understanding than can be summoned at the time for A-B
        comparison would
        be required in order to continue. But still, there is joy and
        satisfaction
        in having created something vital, particularly on hearing it
        freshly
        at
        a later time. </p>
      <p>This method of sculpturing tones and melodies allows a musical
        artist,
        then, to perfect the expression in much the same manner as a
        painter or
        a sculptor can, working with a painting for long periods of
        time,
        gradually
        perfecting the forms so that they correspond to his inner
        vision, a
        vision
        which itself becomes more perfect as the interaction grows. At
        what
        stage
        to say "it is enough" depends on a high level of integration
        where
        another
        vision and its realization interact in a like manner. </p>
      <p>It is also in many ways similar to the process of practicing
        for a
        musical
        performance, in the course of which the artist, enamoured with
        the
        piece,
        refines his performance and understanding through repeated
        reciprocal
        interaction--feedforward
        and feedback. </p>
      <p>Resolution of Parameter Values </p>
      <p>Sensitivity in discriminating different shapes of tones is
        typically
        of the order of 0.01-0.02 in the p values in the range of 0.5 to
        2
        (most
        commonly used). For larger values it is correspondingly greater.
        The
        limen
        of discrimination of the magnitude of amplitude peaks within a
        melody
        is
        of the order of 2% or about 1/4dB. This means that the ear is
        more
        sensitive
        to the shape than to peak amplitude. For example, a difference
        in shape
        resulting in 2% deviation of critical portions of the shape
        (referred
        to
        peak amplitude) will be considerably more noticeable than a 2%
        change
        in
        overall amplitude. Concerning relatively critical portions of
        the shape
        of a tone with respect to sensitivity, see Clynes and Walker,
        supra. </p>
      <p>Mozart Quintet </p>
      <p>An example of a theme embodied by this method is the first
        eight
        bars
        of the Mozart Quintet in G minor, as shown in FIG. 7. </p>
      <p>In this figure, the stave on top shows the notes of the melody.
      </p>
      <p>Graph 1 below this represents the pitch of the sinusoidal tone.
        Small
        markers on this graph indicate repetition of the same note and
        micropauses. </p>
      <p>Graph 2 is the amplitude contour (in linear scale from 0 to
        4096,
        the
        200 point being thus equivalent to -26 dB referred to as the
        loudest
        level;
        1000 being played at about 50 dB above threshold normally). </p>
      <p>Graph 3 represents the temporal deviations from the nominal
        values
        for
        each tone, in percent, upward deflection being slower.
        (Micropauses are
        often included in the representation.) The timer marker at the
        bottom
        of
        all figures represents 1 second. </p>
      <p>The digital printout prints only every sixth point of the
        functions--actual
        resolution is this six times greater than that shown in the
        illustration. </p>
      <p>The table shown below for the Mozart Quintet and similar ones
        gives
        a list of all the tones and rests of the computer realization,
        specifying
        for each; </p>
      <p>1. the duration of the tone, or rest, in points </p>
      <p>2. amplitude size </p>
      <p>3. amplitude shape (p.sub.1, p.sub.2) </p>
      <p>In some tables, where Beta functions are used to span only part
        of
        the
        duration of the tone, as may occur for staccato tones, the sound
        duration
        of staccato tones is given in parenthesis next to the total tone
        duration.
        Micropauses are indicated as "P", Rests as "R". When more than
        one Beta
        function is used for a tone amplitude, they are listed in
        vertical
        sequence
        for that tone. Metronome mark for the nominal unit used (often a
        subdivision
        of a quarter note) is also given. <br>

  <p><br>
The chosen unit of time in the melody (in this case, an eighth note)
is assigned 100 points duration nominally, so that a quarter note
becomes
200 points nominally, a half note 400 points, and so forth. The actual
duration of each tone is modified from these so that a particular
eighth
tone may have a duration of 96, say, a half tone 220; and so on,
depending
on its position and expressive requirements. </p>
  <p>In this example, all parameters (4 for each tone: duration, peak
amplitude,
p.sub.1 and p.sub.2) were chosen by trial and error; that is, by
repeated
listening and gradually improving the values as dictated by "the ear." </p>
  <p>The program allows us to play any portion or the entire theme, and
will
repeat as many times as desired (with a short pause between
repetitions).
The metronome mark entered (i.e. 230) refers to the nominal chosen unit
of duration (in the present example, 100 points for an eighth note). If
an actual tone has more or fewer number of points than 100, it will
have
a correspondingly different duration. Minute tempo variations within
the
theme arise from the differences from nominal values in the number of
points
for each of the tones. </p>
  <p>In this example, we may note the following: </p>
  <p>1. Amplitude Relationship within a Four-tone Group (One Pulse) </p>
  <p>The amplitude relationship between the four eighth notes of the
first
bar shows that the second and fourth tones are much smaller, the fourth
one being a little less than the second. The third tone is considerably
larger in amplitude than the second and fourth but less than the first.
A similar pattern is repeated in the third bar, but the accentuation of
the first tone is even greater. Throughout the theme, the first tone of
each bar is considerably larger in amplitude. </p>
  <p>2. Peak Amplitudes Outline Essentic Form </p>
  <p>The peak amplitude form a descending curve from bar 3 to bar 4.
The
form of this descending curve combines with the frequency contour to
produce
an essentic form related to grief (this form may well be considered to
be a mixed emotion: predominantly sad, with aspects of loneliness,
anxiety,
and perhaps regret). Bars 1 and 2 provide similar forms of diminishing
amplitude, but in bar 1 combined with rising frequency. Pain and
sadness
are implicit in bar 2. Bar 1 suggests a resigned view, accepting fate,
without the quality of hope; "this is how it is; there is nothing that
can be done about it." The combined effect is a combination of grief
with
a stoical, strong acceptance of what is; without defiance or rebellion.
  </p>
  <p>3. Individual Tone Shapes </p>
  <p>The shapes of each individual tone are governed by their place in
the
melodic context. The shorter tones may seem similar in shape on the
graph,
but in fact they are varied, as can be seen from the p values in Table
3. (Small changes in the p values noticeably affect the quality of the
sound.) In the longer tones, such as the fifth tone of bars 1 and 2,
first
and fifth tones of bar 4, the shape of the termination of the tone is
as
important as its rise, for appropriate expression. For the shorter
tones,
the termination phase of the tone relates to the degree of legato that
is achieved. Smaller p values result in greater legato. It is not
generally
necessary to include a DC component to maintain a legato between
succssive
tones. The momentary drop in amplitude between tones shaped by the Beta
Function is not perceived by the ear if it is quite short, as is the
case
for appropriately low p values. Staccato tones are produced in the
first
few examples by choosing appropriate Beta Functions with high p.sub.2
values. </p>
  <p>4. Duration Deviations </p>
  <p>We may note systematic time deviations from the given note values.
First
notes in each bar are lengthened, the second shortened. Hardly any
tones
correspond in duration to the actual note value. Some tones are
lengthened
by as much as 39% (first tone bar 3). Specially lengthened are first
notes
of beats 5, 9, that correspond to accentuated dissonant tones, which
like
suspensions are resolved in the following, second tone of the bar. Such
prolongations induce a lamenting quality in the expression. </p>
  <p>Further Observations </p>
  <p>(a) When working with such a theme, one notices fairly quickly
that
when one changes the amplitude, or duration, of one note, it affects
the
balance of all notes: that is, the theme is an organic entity.
Increasing
the loudness of the fifth tone of bar 3, for example, even by only,
say,
5%, or one dB, will affect its relationship with first tones of bars 3
and 4. Also, it affects its prominence compared to its adjacent tones,
the sixth tone of bar 3 and the fourth tone of bar 3. But further, the
altered amplitude contour now constituted by the peaks of the first and
fifth tones of bar 3, and the first tone of bar 4 affects how bars 1 to
2 balance with bars 3 to 4. </p>
  <p>Similar organic behavior is evident in changing the duration of a
tone.
Additionally, changing the duration of a tone also affects its relative
emphasis. For example, lengthening the upbeat duration will tend to
give
greater prominence and energy to the following main beat, which then in
turn will affect its relation to the other main beats. </p>
  <p>(b) The appropriate way to realize the trill, in bar 4, seemed to
be
to group the trill in terms of 3 and 2 notes (the latter being its
termination),
each group under a single amplitude contour. </p>
  <p>(c) When a phrase is repeated such as in bar 3, the amplitude
relationships
may be similar, but never the same. Whether they tend to be augmented
or
diminished in successive repetitions depends on the specific piece, the
structural design, and the nature of the composer. In the present
theme,
the second presentation is less emphatic than the first. </p>
  <p>Chopin Ballade </p>
  <p>As illustrated in FIG. 8, the opening theme of Chopin's Ballade
Number
3 in A flat shows how a melody written for piano, an instrument of
limited
ability to vary amplitude shapes, can be expressed by varying amplitude
shapes according to its character and not in violation of it. In this
example,
amplitude tone shapes area realized that are implicit in the melody,
and
are heard inwardly even when they are not actually produced. One thinks
this melody with these shapes. Notable in this example is the strong
rubato
in the second part of the first bar. This quickening reaches its
maximum
extent on the fourth eighth note and is counterweighed by a slowing
down
in much of the second bar. </p>
  <p>The microscore for this Chopin piece is as follows: <br>

Automatic Linking of Amplitude Shapes of Individual tones to Melodic
Form </p>
  <p>Having observed and worked with a large number of examples in the
manner
illustrated in the previous section in connection wiht a Mozart Qunitet
and considered the interaction between amplitude shapes of individual
tones
and the music, we were enabled to posit a certain relationship between
the amplitude shapes and the melodic course of the music. </p>
  <p>A and P Classes of Amplitude Shapes </p>
  <p>Let us consider these shapes to belong to a continuum between two
classes
and with intermediate shapes between the two extremes. We may
conveniently
call these classes (A) assertive and (P) plaintive or pleading,
respectively--without
wishing at all thereby to tie the musical expression to such
categories,
of course.) </p>
  <p>We can then consider an actual tone shape as placed somewhere
along
this continuum--and consider the nature of the influence that displaced
it from a neutral position (the base shape) to the place on this
continuum
where it needs to be. </p>
  <p>We can describe forms along this continuum by pairs of p values,
starting
from a base shape (say 1,1) such that as the values of p.sub.1 increase
those of p.sub.2 decrease in proportion, and vice versa. Thus, say, for
example (0.9, 1.11), (0.8, 1.25), (0.7, 1.42) etc. will give a series
of
shapes shifting gradually towards class (A) which has a relatively
sharp
rise time). The inverse series (1.11, 0.9), (1.25, 0.8), (1.42, 0.7)
etc.
will tend more and more towards class (P) (of gradual rise time). </p>
  <p>We then can consider the influence which causes the shift to be
the
slope of the essentic form, as measured by the slope of the pitch
contour. </p>
  <p>More particularly, the deviation from a base shape for a
particular
tone is seen to be a function of the slope of the pitch contour
(essentic
form) at that tone: both pitch and duration determine the deviation in
such a way that: </p>
  <p>(a) Downward (-ve) steps in pitch deviate the shape towards A,
upward
steps toward P, in proportion to the number of semitones between the
tone
and the next tone. </p>
  <p>(b) Deviations are affected by the duration of the tone so that
the
longer the tone, the smaller the deviation (since the slope is
correspondingly
smaller). </p>
  <p>Further, in practice, the slope is measured from the beginning of
the
tone considered to the following tone. In measuring the slope between
the
tone and the next tone, rather than the previous tone, the amplitude
shape
acquires a predictive function. The first derivative of a function has
a predictive property (lead in phase). The amplitude shape associated
with
a particular slope leads us to expect a melodic step in accordance with
it. The movement of the melodic line is thus prepared. </p>
  <p>This appears to match well with its actual function in music,
relating
the present tone to what is to follow, and may be considered to be in
accordance
with musical logic. It gives a sense of continuity both musically and
in
terms of feeling. </p>
  <p>Experience shows that the proportionality constant needs to be an
approximately
10% change in the p values peer semitone, for tones of 250 msec
duration.
The shift is, of course, to be expected to be linear only over a
limited
range; a degree of nonlinearity for both the duration and pitch factors
existing over a broader range. </p>
  <p>In order to see how the duration factor and the pitch factor may
obey
different power laws, the equation is put into the form: ##EQU2## where
s=number of semitones to next tone </p>
  <p>b=const. of p.sub.1,2 by frequency </p>
  <p>a=const. of modulation p.sub.1,2 by duration </p>
  <p>T=duration of tone in milliseconds </p>
  <p>P.sub.1(i), P.sub.2(i) =base (initial values of p.sub.1 and
p.sub.2) </p>
  <p>Experience has shown that preferred values are in the region of <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = 0.00269<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b = 0.20<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________</pre>
  <p><br>
for such music. </p>
  <p>It is to be understood that a simplified or linear equation may be
substituted
for equation (3) having approximately the same behavior within the
range
considered. </p>
  <p>Choice of Base Values </p>
  <p>There remains to consider the choice of the base form, which we
have
nominally put at 1,1. </p>
  <p>In music of different composers, and of different types, it would
seem
that certain preferred base values apply. Values in the vicinity of
(1.2,
0.8) appear as an appropriate choice for much of Beethoven-giving a
greater
legato and more gradual attack. For Mozart, base values around (0.9,
1.1)
give a more rapit decaying sound, and a somewhat sharper attack. For
Schubert,
base values in the vicinity of (1.15, 0.9) are seen to be appropriate. </p>
  <p>These values are influenced by the type of instrumental sound that
the
style of the composer appears to require, and may also be linked to
historical
consideration of the instruments in use at the time. They may also be
related
to how the inner pulse affects the microstructure, which we will
consider
in the next section. </p>
  <p>Equation 3 relates to the use of Beta Functions to obtain the
desired
shift in amplitude shape. In practice, when one chooses not to employ
Beta
Functions, the amplitude shape may be modified as a function of the
slope
of melodic form using traditional expedients for individually shaping
the
component tones of a melody; that is, such expedients as attaack,
decay,
sustain and release, which are appropriately varied. </p>
  <p>Other Implications </p>
  <p>Silence before Downward Leaps </p>
  <p>The rule implies that within a "legato" melody for a tone of given
duration,
the larger the upward leap in pitch to the tone that follows, the more
should the tone have a (P) form, and the larger the downward leap, the
more marked the (A) form, and the larger the downward leap in moderate
and fast tempo this can (depending on the size of the leap and the
duration
of the tone starting the leap) in a momentary silence--a microsilence
(due
to the tail of the (A) form) before the low tone. This is felt as
appropriate
in larger downward leaps. In upward leaps, silence will tend to occur
before
the tone starting the leap. </p>
  <p>Expressiveness of Scales </p>
  <p>Also implied is that tones of scales have somewhat more (P) shape
going
up, and going down more (A) (the exact deviation depending on the tempo
as given by equation (3)). In fact, scales become considerably more
musical
when this rule is appropriately observed. </p>
  <p>(We may also relate the amplitude shape deviations to the type of
gestures
with which one would conduct the music; often a downward gesture goes
with
greater (A)--assertive; an upward gesture with more (P)--plaintive,
pleading). </p>
  <p>Limitations of the Equation </p>
  <p>By the nature of the rule, it cannot predict the amplitude shape
of
the last tone of a melody (since it measures slope to the next
note)--this
must be entered manually. (It is possible, however, that a rule
referring
to last notes of phrases may be formulated which would also take into
account
aspects of larger structure.) Further, it does not apply to tones which
require more than one Beta function. </p>
  <p>The basic thought behind this formulation is: if we can consider
the
available shapes to lie along a continuum between (A) and (P) forms,
then
the slope of the essentic form at that tone determines where in that
continuum
a particular tone lies. The particular merit of this formulation may be
seen in that it harmoniously integrates the behavior of single tones to
that of the larger whole, for different kinds of music. In this, it
seems
to show a surprising elegance and power--and musicality. </p>
  <p>The Composer's Specific Pulse Expressed in Microstructure </p>
  <p>In the previous section, we have been how the amplitude shape of
individual
tones can be derived from the form of the melody. We can now proceed
and
ask, how much of the remaining unaccounted microstructure can be
attributed
to the function of the inner pulse? It seems an unexpectedly large
amount. </p>
  <p>The inner pulse of a given composer is not the same as the rhythm
or
meter of a piece; it is found in slow movements, in fast movements; in
duple time, in triple time, or compound time. The tempo of the pulse
has
generally been considered to be in the range of 50-80 per minute. In
slow
movements, one pulse may correspond to an eighth note, even a sixteenth
in a very slow movement; in a fast movement a half note; and in a
moderate
movement a quarter note. </p>
  <p>The inner pluse as a specific signature of a composer became
established
in Western music around the middle of the eighteenth century and
continued
until the advent of music in whose rhythmic motion there no longer was
interfused and intimate revelation of the personality of the composer.
In the music of Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, Schumann, Chopin,
Brahms,
for example, we find a clear and unique personal pulse which the
composer
has impregnated successfully into his music (the knowledge of which we
ultimately acquire from the score). Indeed, because of the time course
of the inner pulse (0.7-1.2 sec. approx. per cycle), the matrix of its
wave form is most prominently expressed in microstructure. </p>
  <p>In considering the nature of the beat, and of the inner pulse, the
property
of the mervous system called Time Form Printing is very relevant. This
function enables the human organism to decide on a particular form of
movement
to be repeated, and the rate, and then to repeat the movement at that
rate
without further attention--until a separate decision is made to stop or
to alter the form or the rate of the movement. Once conceived as a
repetitive
movement and initiated, the movement will continue in "automatic"
fashion
until stopped. This process takes place mentally when thinking the
beat,
and the inner pulse. </p>
  <p>In practice, this means that once initiated, the inner pulse can
carry
through the musical piece without need for further specific initiation
of form, although the rate will be caused to vary to a degree. Small
pauses
can momentarily suspend the pulse, and act as punctuation, as it were,
in the musical phrasing. </p>
  <p>In any composition, certain parts of the score embody the pulse
more
clearly and obviously than others. However, through Time Form Printing,
the pulse will tend to carry through all parts, if it has been well
initiated
at the beginning of the piece. Scale passages, for example, can become
characteristic of the composer through the pulse: the same scale
passage
can be played with a Mozartian pulse or with a Beethovenian pulse, for
example, and will sound appropriate correspondingly. (This does in fact
happen in satisfying performances.) Thus "neutral" passages acquire
from
the pulse the characteristic "flavor" of the composer. This, of course,
is precisely the province of microstructure, and we shall show how this
occurs. </p>
  <p>By experimenting with such neutral structures, and combining the
results
with knowledge of the inner pulse forms as expressed through touch, we
can arrive empirically at an answer to the question: What does the
inner
pulse do to the specific tones in a piece of music? </p>
  <p>Concerning the Derivation of Pulse Microstructure Values </p>
  <p>The following considerations have aided the derivation of these
values. </p>
  <p>Characteristics of the pulse matrix may be in part connected to
the
kinesthetic "feel" of the pulse, observed in recording it
sentographically.
We have seen that different degrees of inertia, damping, can be
experienced
for pulses of various composers, and for some pulses different kinds of
tensions occurring at specific phases. </p>
  <p>These show up indirectly in the recorded sentographic form; but
appear
to be significant clues to the deviations in amplitude and duration
that
constitute the matrix. Different degrees of inertia, or sluggishness,
are
brought about by different modes of tensions by agonist and antagonist
muscle groups (as a result of which greater or lesser massiveness is
displayed
by the arm--e.g., more of the upperarm mass is involved). This
massiveness,
a mental program, translates to the degree of flexibility of modulation
within a pulse. The Beethoven pulse has high inertia, the Mozart pulse
low inertia. Accordingly, we would expect to see much greater
differences
bewteen the amplitude of component tones for Mozart than for Beethoven.
Indeed, there is a relative effortlessness in changing the loudness
level
in Mozart within a pulse, that is not present in Beethoven. </p>
  <p>The massiveness has an influence also on the duration deviations,
since
each pulse cycle contains an initiating point at a particular phrase
(near
the time of the upbeat). The deviation values can also be looked at the
light of rhythm studies that relate the energy of a beat to the
duration
and amplitude of the upbeat, in relation to a given downbeat. High
inertia
would accordingly tend to be accompanied by a longer duration upbeat. </p>
  <p>Pulse Matrix of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert </p>
  <p>A two-fold effect may be observed: The inner pulse affects </p>
  <p>1. Relative amplitude sizes of its component tones. </p>
  <p>2. Duration deviations of its component tones. </p>
  <p>Both 1 and 2 must occur. Either alone is insufficient.
Accordingly,
the influence of a composer's pulse is stated for a particular meter by
a matrix that specifies (1) amplitude ratio, (2) duration deviations. </p>
  <p>The following matrices specify the influence of the inner pulse
for
Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert, respectively, for the 4/4/ meter. For
each
tone, two numbers are given. One specifies the amplitude size ratio,
referred
to the first tone as 1. The other gives the duration referred to as 100
as a mean duration for the 4 components. <br>

  <p><br>
Salient Features of the Pulse Matrices </p>
  <p>The Mozart Pulse </p>
  <p>Large amplitude difference between first tone and the
others--archness
in articulation, second tone very slightly softer than the fourth tone,
the third tone having a subsidiary accent, subdividing the four tones. </p>
  <p>Duration deviations are rather symmetrical, first and third tones
moderately
longer. </p>
  <p>The Beethoven Pulse </p>
  <p>Amplitude ratios generally more even, fourth tone not softer than
third.
Second considerably softer than first. </p>
  <p>Durations </p>
  <p>First tone considerably extended </p>
  <p>Fourth tone considerably extended. </p>
  <p>The extended duration of the fourth tone combined with its
relatively
high amplitude is a cardinal feature of the Beethoven pulse. The third
tone is not extended in duration, and is more nearly equal to the first
tone in amplitude than for Mozart. A more even, less arched
articulation,
with a special aspect to the fourth tone. (A resistance is displayed
against
"excessive" amplitude modulation--experienced often as a kind of
"ethical
restraint.") First and second tone taken together are contracted
compared
with the third and fourth tone together. </p>
  <p>The Schubert Pulse </p>
  <p>Low amplitude of the third tone--no subdivision; higher amplitude
and
short duration of the fourth tone. No duration extension of the first
tone
(or third tone) but a considerably extended duration of the second
tone.
Third and fourth tones, taken together, are contracted compared with
first
and second tones together. </p>
  <p>The unusually extended duration, without accent, of the second
tone
of the Schubert pulse can be linked to the following: </p>
  <p>1. The special tension that occurs in the corresponding part of
the
Schubert pulse, a pulling upward, uniquely characteristic of the
Schubert
pulse. Its initial downward phase acts on low inertia. During the
course
of a rebound, however, a tension is added, increasing the resistance
and
slowing down what otherwise would be a carefree bounce, into an
entirely
different character, an impression of being pulled upwards. </p>
  <p>2. It can be seen in the scores of Schubert's music that there is
a
predilection for special treatment melodically, or in other ways, of
the
weak tone following the first tone of the bar. In performance and in
thought,
these deviations are not experienced as unevenness, but appear as an
appropriate
flow. </p>
  <p>Pulse matrix values for triple meters are as follows for the three
composers
illustrated: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR4##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR5##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR6##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________</pre>
  <p><br>
Values for duple meter are derived simply from the quadruple values
by adding the duration of tones 1 and 2, and of tones 3 and 4,
respectively,
to obtain the duration proportions, and keeping the amplitude values
for
tones 1 and 3, which now become 1 and 2. </p>
  <p>Thus the matrix values for duple meter are: <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR7##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR8##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR9##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________</pre>
  <p><br>
Pulse matrices for compound meters can be derived from the above
as follows: </p>
  <p>The two matrices are combined so that ##EQU3## where A.sub.c (i,j)
is
the compound pulse amplitude </p>
  <p>D.sub.c (i,j) is the compound pulse duration </p>
  <p>A.sub.1 (i), A.sub.2 (j) are the simple pulse amplitudes and </p>
  <p>D.sub.1 (i), D.sub.2 (j) are thesimple pulse durations
respectively
for the i.sup.th and j.sup.th tone of the simple pulses. </p>
  <p>To allow for different degrees of hierarchical dependence
attenuation
factors are introduced that allow the effectiveness of the subordinate
pulse structure to be de-emphasised or emphasised, with the parameters
n and m, so that when n=1 and m=1, a full hierarchical effect is
obtained,
and for smaller values the duration and/or amplitude effects of the
subordinate
pulse structure are relatively more attenuated. Thus ##EQU4## Values of
n and m in the range of 0.7 to 0.8 are found to be often appropriate. </p>
  <p>For example, the 6/8 pulse for Beethoven is <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR10##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ##STR11##<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ______________________________________</pre>
  <p><br>
The effect is that each group of 3 tones constitutes a small 3-pulse,
and the two groups of 3 tones form a 2-pulse. </p>
  <p>Applying the Pulse to a Melody Having Various Note Values </p>
  <p>When a melody has a combination of notes of different values, as
is
generally the case (some larger and some smaller than the component
values),
the following appears to apply: </p>
  <p>1. Duration deviations are proportioned according to the component
tones
of the pulses; e.g., a dotted quarter has the duration deviation of one
tone plus half that of the next. </p>
  <p>2. The amplitude is taken as that prevalent at the beginning of
the
tone; i.e., is not averaged; e.g., the dotted quarter has the same
amplitude
as the quarter would have had without the dot. </p>
  <p>While it appears that the range of 50-80 per minute is an
approximately
useful guideline in applying the pulse, some pieces may present
alternate
possibilities of a larger or smaller frame for the pulse. </p>
  <p>An example of automatic operation of the system using a pulse
matrix
and using automatic calculations of amplitude shape (p values) is given
in FIG. 9. </p>
  <p>In general, it should be emphasized that the pulse and its effects
in
microstructure as described herein is in no way to be considered a
binding
Procrustes bed, but rather as a level from where fine artistic
realization
of the music can be more readily attempted, taking into account the
individual
concept of the piece, and personal interpretive perferences. </p>
  <p>Additional Expressive Functions And Properties Considered </p>
  <p>Further properties of melodic relationships relevant to manual and
computer
realizations are: </p>
  <p>1. Microstructural </p>
  <p>In working with the various examples manually, we may readily note
that: </p>
  <p>(a) A tone of smaller amplitude following a larger amplitude tone
will
sound more legato than in the reverse order, for given amplitude shapes
(p values). </p>
  <p>(b) A tone will sound softer after a tone of greater amplitude
than
before it (a masking effect, the degree depends on the tempo). </p>
  <p>(c) Micropauses often need to be inserted between phrases, and
longer
Luftpauses between major sections. They are appropriate for all
composers.
The placement of these is important, and not automatic. These pauses
tend
to be placed at the end of pulses (before the next upbeat tone, where
there
is one). They also occur immediately before a subito piano. </p>
  <p>At times the required pauses are actually provided for by the p
values,
as calculated by the rule given, by means of the tail of the amplitude
shape--this means that in such a place, the composer's indication of
phrasing
indicates the amplitude shape required by the music. Also, they may be
appropriate between separate bowing marks (as distinguished from
phrasing
signs--an often difficult distinction), but not always. </p>
  <p>2. Structural </p>
  <p>(a) Pitch Crescendo </p>
  <p>It can be noted that there is a general tendency within a melody
to
increased loudness with higher pitch. This tendency is not found to the
same degree, however, for different music and different composers. For
Beethoven, it is appropriate to keep the amplitudes in terms of voltage
similar. This insures a small degree of crescendo, since a given
voltage
amplitude is perceived as louder with increasing pitch. For Mozart,
however,
this crescendo tends to be greater--approximately an additional 4
db/octave.
For Schubert, it can be even more than 6 db/octave. </p>
  <p>If the same melodic crescendo is applied to Beethoven, the effect
tends
to sound exaggerated. There is a resistance to such crescendo in
Beethoven,
a restraint that (as in the modern modulation of tone amplitude heights
by the Beethoven pulse) appears to translate into the strength of an
ethical
constraint. </p>
  <p>(b) Alternation of "heavy" and "light" bars </p>
  <p>This is a general structural property (not explicit in the score)
which
can be produced on the computer by scaling down the "light" bars. For
Mozart,
a sutiable amplitude proportion may be 0.72, and bars often (but of
course
not always) alternate as Heavy-Light, Heavy-Light. This ads
considerably
to the sense of musical balance and logic, where appropriate; it
presents
larger units to the mind, allowing a greater overview. </p>
  <p>In Beethoven, other patterns tend to dominate and often special
dramatic
devices, such as crescendo and subito piano. Crescendi and Diminuendi
specially
noted by the composer in the score have, of course, to be included in
the
computer realizations. </p>
  <p>A Preferred Procedure for Shaping A Melody </p>
  <p>We may concisely summarize the steps involved in controlling
microstructure
for the artistic shaping of a melody. Steps 7 to 9 are not always
required.
Some of these steps can be combined into single, automatic operations: </p>
  <p>1. Enter tones and nominal durations according to score. </p>
  <p>2. Choose tempo. </p>
  <p>3. Apply pulse matrix for the particular composer, and particular
meter
(choose length of pulse) (B, M, or S for Beethoven, Mozart and
Schubert,
respectively). </p>
  <p>4. Insert micropauses of appropriate duration at appropriate
places
(end of phrases and other special points). </p>
  <p>5. Choose base p.sub.1, p.sub.2 values and let the program
calculate
p. values for amplitude shapes of individual tones. </p>
  <p>6. Adjust last tones of phrases by "ear" (both amplitude and p
values). </p>
  <p>7. Apply pitch cres-dim function as appropriate, and any cres or
dim
or special accents directed by the score. </p>
  <p>8. As required, modify amplitude and/or duration of one or several
key
tones to shape a particular essentic form. </p>
  <p>9. If phrases repeat, subtly change the repetition as desired. </p>
  <p>The first tone only of the theme is generally to be lengthened in
duration
by about 5%, at the beginning of a piece (but not on subsequent
reintroductions
of the theme). </p>
  <p>A few minutes are generally sufficient to carry out these steps.
It
is, of course, useful to listen to the result after each step is taken.
Micropauses p.sub.1, p.sub.2 base values or other parameters can be
adjusted
at any time to improve the result, as desired. </p>
  <p>The Stability of Pulse Matrices </p>
  <p>The pulse matrix values given previously are subject to further
refinement.
The salient features of the specific pulse matrices hold over a wide
range;
but their degree of prominence is likely to be influenced to some
degree
by the tempo (with the range given; 50-80 per minute), and by pitch
height
of the entire theme (i.e., transposition). These factors may modify the
elements within the pulse matrices as a second order effect. Other
second
order changes in the pulse forms may occur with variables such as
variables
related to specific pieces and the composer's age. </p>
  <p>Relation of Timbre to Microstructure </p>
  <p>Timbre is essential for melodic expressiveness when there is more
than
one melodic line. Several sinusoids tend to coalesce and fuse--for
distinctness
of voice leading and contrast sounds with different dynamic proportions
of harmonics are required. Secondly, we can now, in the light of the
present
studies with sinusoids, investigate how timbre variations are of help
in
improving expressiveness of a single melogic line. </p>
  <p>Within each tone it is possible to add timbre (and also vibrato)
various
dynamic ways to the expressive forms already determined, and to see how
such individually shaped time varying functions of timbre for each tone
(time-shaped harmonic content--not only in relation to the attack) may
augment or interfere with expressiveness. One must take into account
the
complication that addint timbre (and/or vibrato) can modify the
perception
of amplitude shapes, in part because the overtones require their own
amplitude
shaping (not according to the amplitude shapes of the fundamental), as
well as for psychophysiologic reasons related to persistence of hearing
and dynamic masking. </p>
  <p>Summary of Findings </p>
  <p>We have found that: </p>
  <p>1. Expressiveness and Microstructure can be fruitfully studied
with
amplitude-modulated sinusoidal sounds. Musical meaning in its subtlety
can be largely expressed by this means for single melogic lines. </p>
  <p>2. A systematic realtion appears to exist between individual
amplitude
shapes of tones of a melody and its course, so that the shape can be
predicted
from the slope; and thus is heard to presage the next tone of a
melody--forging
an organic link, and making it possible for the living qualities
inherent
in the melodic shape to cast a presence within each tone. </p>
  <p>3. In music which incorporates a personal pulse, this is shown to
systematically
affect both amplitude and duration of component tones in a way
characteristic
to that personal pulse, as also an individual's signature bears the
continuing
stamp of his person. The realization of the pulse and its effects is
seen
to be necessary for the life, power and beauty of such music. </p>
  <p>Among the advantages of imparting microstructure to a musical
score
in a computerized system in accordance with the invention are the
following: </p>
  <p>1. It can improve one's artistic understanding and output. </p>
  <p>2. Far from being "mechanical," it can infuse life and livingness
into
music. </p>
  <p>3. It tends to give us a degree of understanding of the very
nature
of that livingness, as bound to iconic and unique form. </p>
  <p>4. It allows us to use imagination and creative insight from a
higher
hierarchic point of view, using as units of though entities that before
needed to be specially constructed every time from constituent parts. </p>
  <p>The practical applications of a computerized system in accordance
with
the invention to music education are obvious and therefore need not be
detailed. In an age of personal computers, the programs developed
therefor
can give access to creative interpretation to all so inclined without
the
need to acquire physical musical skills or manual dexterity. </p>
  <p>The invention is also useful to a serious or amateur composer, for
it
allows the composer to incorporate his own realization of
microstructure
into the macrostructure of his own composition, and it also allows him
to experiment with inner pulse forms. The final proudct thereby
reflects
the imagination, feeling and discernment of the individual who shapes a
musical composition. The computerized system serves as a tool which
assists
its user in thinking musically in a manner somewhat analogous to the
relationship
of an electronic calculator to a mathematical concept. </p>
  <p>The Computerized System </p>
  <p>Referring now to FIG. 10, there is shown a manually-operated
computerized
system in accordance with the invention based on the technique
disclosed
hereinabove for processing the nominal tones of a raw score entered
therein
to impart an expressive microstructure thereto. </p>
  <p>The system includes a beta function calculator 10. In the
calculator
is entered by way of a computer keyboard or means performing a like
function
represented by entry station 11, the successive tones of a music score
in terms of their nominal pitch and duration values expressed in
alpha-numeric
terms. Thus the pitch of a given note, which depends on its position on
the staff, is represented by an appropriate value, as is the duration
of
the same note. In practice, an electronic piano keyboard may be used.
By
depressing a selected key, there is produced an appropriate value for
entry
into the calculator. In that case, the tone duration will have to be
normalized. </p>
  <p>Also entered manually into calculator 10 is the desired microscore
of
each nominal note. By "microscore" is meant digital values representing
desired deviations from the nominal values of the note necessary to its
processing to impart a microstructure thereto. </p>
  <p>Thus the p.sub.1 and p.sub.2 values required by the beta function
to
shape the amplitude contour of each note is entered as well as digital
values representing changes in the duration of each note and values
representing
the relative amplitude of successive notes in the score. Also entered
are
micropauses and whatever other variables are to be processed by the
system,
such as timbre. </p>
  <p>From entry station 11, there are two channels C.sub.1 and C.sub.2
leading
into calculator 10, channel C.sub.1 conveying the amplitude and timing
data, and channel C.sub.2 the pitch and timbre data for each note. </p>
  <p>Calculator 10 is programmed to process the data supplied thereto
and
to yield a series of equi-spaced digital values V during a specified
interval,
as shown in FIG. 11, that represent the successive amplitude levels in
the contoured tone T whose microstructure duration is interval P. In
the
absence of the microstructure impressed on the nominal tone, its form
would
be represented by a square wave of constant amplitude and predetermined
duration, which depends on whether it is a whole note, a half note or
whatever
else is notated. </p>
  <p>The series of digital values V, which outline the amplitude shape,
are
applied to a D-to-A converter 12 to yield an analog voltage A.sub.1
reflecting
the amplitude contour or envelope of the processed note. The digital
data
derived from entry station 11, which represents the frequency of each
note,
is also fed to D/A converter 12 to yield an analog voltage A.sub.2,
reflecting
the pitch of the tone to be played. </p>
  <p>Analog voltage A.sub.1 representing the amplitude contour is
applied
to a voltage-controlled amplifier 13 (VCA) whose output is applied to a
loudspeaker 14. Analog voltage A.sub.2 representing the pitch is
applied
to a voltage-controlled oscillator 15 whose output frequency is in
accordance
with the pitch of the tone. The sinusoidal output of this oscialltor
may
be applied directly to amplifier 13, in which event the reproduced
structure
impressed thereon. Alternatively, the oscillator output may be applied
to the amplifier through a timbre network 16 which changes the
sinisoidal
wave shape so that the resultant tone is rich in harmonics and
therefore
has a timbre depending on its harmonic content. </p>
  <p>Any known means may be used for introducing a varying harmonic
content.
One approach is to combine a sinusoidal wave SW, as shown in FIG. 12,
with
the differentiated form DW of a square wave having the same period, the
resultant sharp pulses being adjustably clipped and rectified to
provide
sharp peaks which, when summed with the sinusoidal wave, produce a
nonsinusoidal
wave having a desired harmonic content that depends on the adjustment
of
clipping and rectification. The resultant sum may be further variably
rectified
to provide preponderantly even or odd harmonics. </p>
  <p>With each tone, the timbre is varied through a number of D to A
control
channels, typically up to 4 channels, each output of which is shaped by
beta functions or equivalent means. All of these functions can also be
carried out in an entirely digital manner in a digital synthesizer. </p>
  <p>It is to be understood that among the means usable for producing a
varying
harmonic content are additive or subtractive synthesizers, wave shaping
and other means, realized either digitally or through analog means. </p>
  <p>It is to be understood that while calculator 10 is advantageously
operated
in accordance with the beta function disclosed herein requiring only
two
parameters (p.sub.1 and p.sub.2), in order to produce a desired
amplitude
contour, any known electronic means to effect amplitude shaping in
response
to applied digital parameters may be used for the same purpose. </p>
  <p>In operating a system in accordance with the invention in an
automatic
mode, all of the digital values with respect to amplitude and duration
necessary to impart a microstructure to the nominal note values of the
raw musical score entered therein may be stored, as shown in FIG. 13,
in
a pulse matrix 17 which in one output channel A.sub.3 yields the
amplitude
and timing data required to process each note, and in another output
channel
A.sub.4 yields the necessary pitch data for each note. The digital data
from channel A.sub.3 is applied to an amplitude-shape calculator 18,
while
digital data from channel A.sub.4 is applied to a timbre calculator 19.
  </p>
  <p>The amplitude envelope from amplitude shape calculator 18 is
applied
to a tone generator 20, while tone shape data from timbre calculator 19
is also applied to the tone generator which generates tones having the
desired microstructure. In the amplitude-shape calculator, the shaping
function related to the melodic and essentic form is calculated as a
deviation
from a base shape in accordance with Equation 3, as explained
previously. </p>
  <p>It is to be understood that when two or more tones are to be
sounded
simultaneously, separate channels will be required for each tone and
their
outputs summed. Tones may also be directed to different loudspeakers to
crease stereo and spatial sound effects. </p>
  <p>While there has been shown and described a preferred embodiment of
a
computerized system for imparting an expressive microstructure to a
musical
score in accordance with the invention, it will be appreciated that
many
changes and modifications may be made therein without, however,
departing
from the essential spirit thereof. Thus, while the invention has been
illustrated
as it applied to classical music, the invention is by no means limited
to this application, for it is fully applicable to all other forms of
music,
including popular and ethnic. </p>
  <p>It must also be noted that the microstructure elements set forth
herein
may be used to modulate visual presentations so that by employing video
graphics, the shape, brightness and color of visually displayed forms
may
be variously modified to express visual counterparts to the
expressiveness
imparted to music by the microstructure. Simultaneous presentations of
such sound and visual forms may further enhance their expressive
quality. </p>
  <p>The visual presentations may assume free or abstract forms which,
by
reason of the microstructural modulation, become more expressive and
appear
to move or dance and thereby take on a more animated character. For
example,
the visual presentation may be in the form of a conductor's baton whose
movement is related to a musical score and its microstructure. Human
body
or facial expressions may be made responsive to microstructural
modulations.
Such microstructure can also be used to supplement or refine existing
dance
notation, such as Laban notation. </p>
