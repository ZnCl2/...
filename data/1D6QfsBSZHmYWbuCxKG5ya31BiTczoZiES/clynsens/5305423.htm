      <p>A system including a touch pressure-sensitive transducer and a
        computer
        responsive thereto for producing a sentic cycle and for
        recording touch
        expression in the course of which cycle different emotions are
        expressed
        and generated by applying appropriate finger pressure to the
        transducer
        actuator. Stored in the memory of the computer is a set of words
        representing
        the different emotions, the computer being programmed to
        sequentially
        select
        these words at timed intervals and to audibly reproduce the
        selected
        word.
        Each word is followed by a series of time-spaced audible start
        clicks,
        each commanding the subject when to express with finger pressure
        on the
        transducer actuator. The signals yielded by the transducer
        reflecting
        vector
        components of the applied finger pressure are processed in the
        computer
        whose display terminal then presents on its screen a sentogram,
        the
        shape
        of which characterizes the emotion sensed by the transducer.
        Single or
        averaged sentograms developed by the subject during a particular
        sentic
        cycle are stored in the computer for comparison with those
        produced by
        the same subject in subsequent cycles to gauge the degree to
        which the
        subject's emotional responses may have changed. Stored or "live"
        sentograms
        can also be used to impart emotional content to graphically
        reproduced
        animated figures or to reproduced music modulated as a function
        of the
        sentogram, or to movement activated according to its dynamic
        form. </p>

      <b><i>Description ~</i></b>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to a technique adapted to
        generate
        in a subject being treated different emotions which he expresses
        tactilely
        by applying finger pressure to a pressure-sensitive transducer,
        and
        more
        particularly to a system which includes the transducer and a
        computer
        responsive
        thereto for carrying out this technique, the computer being
        programmed
        to sequentially select from its memory each word in a set of
        words
        representing
        different emotions and to reproduce the selected word so that it
        can be
        heard by the subject who then, when commanded to do so by a
        series of
        time-spaced
        audible start clicks, applies finger pressure to the transducer
        whose
        output
        signals are processed in the computer to develop on its display
        terminal
        a sentogram, the shape of which characterizes the emotion
        expressed by
        the subject. </p>
      <p>2. Status of Prior Art </p>
      <p>My prior U.S. Pat. No. 3,691,652 (Clynes), entitled "Programmed
        System
        for Evoking Emotional Responses," discloses a system adapted to
        internally
        generate in a subject different emotional states in a programmed
        manner.
        By going through a timed sequence of these states in the course
        of a
        sentic
        cycle during which the subject applies finger pressure to a
        pressure-sensitive
        transducer in a manner expressing the emotion he then feels, the
        subject's
        ability to freely express emotion and overcome inhibitive and
        repressive
        tendencies is enhanced. </p>
      <p>In my prior system, the programmer takes the form of a magnetic
        tape
        cassette player which reproduces at timed intervals in the
        course of a
        sentic cycle a sequence of words each donating a specific
        generalized
        emotion,
        such as love, hate, anger or grief. Every presented word is
        followed by
        a series of time-spaced audible start clicks commanding the
        subject,
        upon
        hearing each click, to express the denoted emotion by pressing
        with a
        finger
        the actuator element of the transducer in a manner which
        expresses this
        emotion. This transducer which senses vector components of the
        applied
        finger pressure yields output signals which are applied to a TV
        monitor
        on whose screen is displayed in real time the transient pattern
        or
        sentic
        shape of the subject's tactile expression of a particular
        emotion. </p>
      <p>A similar system is disclosed in my U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,922
        (Clynes)
        entitled "System for Producing Personalized Sentograms." In this
        system,
        the programmer is also a magnetic tape cassette player, but
        instead of
        presenting a sequence of words representing different
        generalized
        emotions,
        presented in sequence are words, each identifying an individual
        with
        whom
        the subject has a close relationship or about whom the subject
        has a
        distinct
        feeling. </p>
      <p>In the system disclosed in my '922 patent, the transducer is
        coupled
        not only to a TV monitor as in the '652 patent, but also to an
        averaging
        device whose output represents the average of ten responses or
        whatever
        number of click-started responses is sensed for each announced
        name
        generating
        an emotional response. The averaged sentic shape is then
        recorded to
        produce
        a personalized sentogram for each name. </p>
      <p>As pointed out in my '922 patent, the collection of
        personalized
        sentograms
        developed by the subject in response to a series of names is
        useful in
        characterizing his condition. Each personalized sentogram may be
        analyzed
        in the light of sentograms representing abstract, generalized
        emotions.
        For example, if the personalized sentogram for "father" is quite
        similar
        in its essentic form to an abstract sentogram for "love,"
        clearly the
        subject
        feels love for his father. But in other instances, the
        personalized
        sentograms
        may exhibit compound effects, such as fear-awe or hate-anger, in
        which
        event one finds in the personalized sentograms hybrid forms of
        the
        abstract
        sentograms. The collection of personalized sentograms therefore
        lends
        itself
        to analysis to provide a personality relationship profile of the
        subject. </p>
      <p>My above-identified copending application discloses a
        self-sufficient
        sentic cycler unit which dispenses with the need for a magnetic
        tape
        player
        as the programmer. The unit includes a solid-state memory having
        digitally
        stored therein a set of words representing different emotions,
        as well
        as a click or other command signal instructing the subject to
        tactilely
        express the emotion represented by the word selected from the
        memory.
        The
        memory is controlled by a programmed microprocessor associated
        with a
        clock
        to produce a sentic cycle in the course of which words are
        selected
        from
        the set in a predetermined sequence, each selected word being
        followed
        by a series of time-spaced clicks. The digital output of the
        memory is
        converted into an analog signal that is reproduced so that it
        can be
        heard
        by the subject. The unit is provided with a finger rest which is
        to be
        pressed by the subject, who after hearing a selected word then
        hears a
        command click in the click series following the word. After each
        audible
        click, the subject then exerts finger pressure on the finger
        rest in a
        manner expressive of the emotion generated or evoked by the
        word. </p>
      <p>The unit disclosed in my copending application does not use a
        pressure-sensitive
        transducer from whose output is derived a sentogram. In that
        unit,
        finger
        pressure is applied by the subject to a finger rest to obtain an
        emotional
        release and other psychological benefits, and sentograms play no
        role
        in
        this context. </p>
      <p>Also of prior art interest are my U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,999,773,
        4,763,257
        and 4,704,682 (Clynes) which disclose systems in which music is
        imbued
        with a composer's inner pulse and/or with predictive amplitude
        shapes
        embodying
        emotional meaning. These patents are hereinafter referred to
        collectively
        as my music processing patents. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>In view of the foregoing, the main object of this invention is
        to
        provide
        a system that includes a pressure-sensitive transducer and a
        computer
        responsive
        to the signals yielded by the transducer for producing a sentic
        cycle
        in
        the course of which there are evoked in a subject being treated
        different
        emotions, each of which he seeks to express by applying finger
        pressure
        to the actuator of the transducer. </p>
      <p>More particularly, an object of the invention is to provide a
        system
        of the above type in which the computer processes the signals
        yielded
        by
        the transducer so as to present on the screen of its display
        terminal a
        sentogram whose shape characterizes the emotion expressed by the
        subject. </p>
      <p>A significant advantage of the invention is that the same
        computer
        also
        functions to average the series of sentograms produced by the
        subject
        in
        expressing a particular emotion, from which averaged sentogram
        one can
        determine maximum and minimum slopes, curvatures and amplitudes.
        These
        measurements, which can be also taken from single sentograms,
        can be
        compared
        with stored sentogram values, from which an index of similarity
        can be
        calculated to inform the subject of his condition or the
        progress he
        has
        made in using the system. </p>
      <p>Another advantage of the system is that the sentograms it
        develops
        and
        stores can be used to impart a heightened emotional content to
        graphically
        produced animated figures or to reproduced music. Or the music
        produced
        in accordance with my music processing patents can be used with
        or
        without
        sentograms to visually modulate these animated figures. </p>
      <p>Also an object of this invention is to provide means to
        transform
        a
        single or averaged sentogram whose shape represents a subject's
        emotion
        into a corresponding physical movement which so activates a
        device such
        as a chair, a bed or a vibrator coupled to or occupied by an
        individual
        so as to communicate this emotion to the individual. </p>
      <p>Briefly stated, these objects are attained in a system
        including a
        touch
        pressure-sensitive transducer and a computer responsive thereto
        for
        producing
        a sentic cycle and recording touch expression in the course of
        which
        cycle
        different emotions are expressed and generated by applying
        appropriate
        finger pressure to the actuator of the transducer. Stored in the
        memory
        of the computer is a set of words representing the different
        emotions,
        the computer being programmed to sequentially select these words
        at
        timed
        intervals and to audibly reproduce the selected word. Each word
        is
        followed
        by a series of time-spaced audible start clicks, each commanding
        the
        subject
        when to express with finger pressure on the transducer actuator.
      </p>
      <p>The signals yielded by the transducer which reflect vector
        components
        of the applied finger pressure are processed in the computer
        whose
        display
        terminal then presents on its screen a sentogram, the shape of
        which
        characterizes
        the emotions sensed by the transducer. Sentograms developed by
        the
        subject
        during a particular sentic cycle or from single expressions are
        stored
        in the computer for comparison with those produced by the same
        subject
        in subsequent cycles to gauge the degree to which the subject's
        emotional
        responses may have changed. </p>
      <p>A stored stored sentogram derived from any expressed emotion,
        single
        or averaged, can also be useful to impart an emotional content
        to
        graphically-produced
        animated figures or reproduced music modulated as a function of
        the
        sentogram. </p>
      <p>Similarly, shapes of emotional meaning derived from the
        computer
        program
        disclosed in my music processing patents may be used to create
        an
        animated
        "danse" integral with the emotion and the music. And a sentogram
        may be
        transformed into a corresponding physical movement serving to
        communicate
        the emotion expressed thereby to others. </p>
      <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWING </p>
      <p>For a better understanding of the invention as well as other
        objects
        and further features thereof, reference is made to the following
        detailed
        description to be read in conjunction with the accompanying
        drawing
        whose
        single FIGURE is a block diagram of a computerized system for
        producing
        sentic cycles in accordance with the invention. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>In a system in accordance with the invention, there is provided
        a
        pressure-sensitive
        transducer 10 having an actuator which when pressed by a finger
        of the
        subject being treated, causes the transducer to yield electrical
        analog
        signals representing vector components of the applied pressure,
        from
        which
        signals a sentogram is derived. These signals are applied to a
        digital
        computer 11. </p>
      <p>In practice, the transducer may be constituted by strain
        gauges,
        force-sensitive
        resistors or capacitive elements adapted to sense the horizontal
        and
        vertical
        components of finger pressure applied to actuator 10A which may
        be in
        the
        form of a cantilevered finger rest. Optionally, one may also
        include
        left
        and right pressure-sensitive elements to produce
        three-dimensional
        sentograms
        defined by the pressure components in mutually perpendicular X,
        Y and Z
        directions. </p>
      <p>The subject being treated preferably should be in a sitting
        position,
        with the transducer placed, say, on the arm rest of a chair or
        on a
        table
        whose level is such that the subject can extend his arm
        horizontally
        whereby
        he may comfortably engage the actuator with the middle finger of
        one
        hand. </p>
      <p>In order to be able to process the transducer analog signals in
        digital
        computer 11 included in the system, they must first be converted
        into
        digital
        signals. For this purpose, the analog signals from transducer 10
        are
        applied
        through an amplifier 12, such as one having FET stages, to an
        analog-to-digital
        converter 13 whose output is fed into an input 14 of the
        computer.
        Alternatively,
        the pressure-sensing element may be incorporated in an
        oscillator whose
        frequency varies as a function of the force applied to the
        sensing
        element,
        the frequency of the oscillator being counted to provide a
        digital
        input
        to the computer through an appropriate input port. </p>
      <p>In a typical digital computer, the hardware includes a central
        processing
        unit (CPU) and a main storage unit (MS) serving to store both
        the
        program
        and the data on which it operates. A storage address register
        (SAR)
        holds
        the address of the storage location to be activated, either in
        order to
        read the contents of the location or for storing into the
        location. A
        storage
        data register (SDR) temporarily holds data being read into and
        out of
        storage,
        while an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) performs the specified
        operation
        on the data presented at its inputs. The ALU is routed to either
        a
        register
        stack (RS), an I/O control unit (IOCU) or to main storage (MS)
        by means
        of signals from the central processing unit (CPU). </p>
      <p>The register stack (RS) included in the computer is a special
        purpose
        storage unit usable for the temporary storage of data and
        addresses,
        and
        when put to use instead of main storage (MS) it is because it
        can be
        accessed
        more quickly. The I/O control unit (IOCU) represents the means
        which
        provide
        for the detailed control of the input/output units such as video
        terminals
        and data acquisition equipment. The instruction address register
        (IAR)
        contains the locations of the instructions currently being
        executed,
        whereas
        the instruction register (IR) is a temporary storage location in
        which
        the current instruction is held during execution. </p>
      <p>The computer hardware is controlled by a series of instructions
        which
        are stored in main storage (MS), the sequence of instructions
        constituting
        the computer program. </p>
      <p>In a system in accordance with the invention, computer 10 is
        preferably
        an integrated circuit microcomputer whose chips contain a
        central
        processing
        unit (CPU), a program memory (ROM), a data memory (RAM),
        oscillator and
        clock circuits, and an input/output (I/O) structure. In FIG. 1,
        only
        those
        elements of the computer necessary for an understanding of the
        system
        and
        the computer program are included. Computer 10 is programmed to
        respond
        to finger pressure applied by a subject to transducer 10 and to
        execute
        a sentic cycle. </p>
      <p>Digitally stored at different sites in a ROM 15 or in any other
        computer
        storage facility are a set of words required for a sentic cycle
        lasting,
        say, about 30 minutes. Typically, these words are "no emotion,"
        "anger,"
        "hate," "grief," "love," "sex," "joy" and "reverence." Also
        digitally
        stored
        in ROM 15 is the sound of a start click such that as that
        produced by a
        soft knock on a piece of wood or any other abrupt sound signal
        acting
        to
        command the subject to apply finger pressure to the transducer
        actuator
        to physically express the emotion the subject feels that is
        represented
        by a word selected from the computer memory. </p>
      <p>ROM 15 is controlled by a central processing unit 16 associated
        with
        a clock 17. As governed by clock 17, the computer is programmed
        so as
        to
        extract at predetermined intervals from ROM 15 in the course of
        each
        sentic
        cycle, successive words from the word set digitally stored in
        the ROM.
        Each word is followed by a series of time-spaced audible start
        clicks
        which
        command the subject to tactilely respond to the previously
        extracted
        word. </p>
      <p>The digital output of ROM 15 is converted by a D-to-A converter
        18
        into
        a corresponding analog signal. This analog signal, which is in
        stepped
        form, is applied, after suitable filtering, to an amplifier 19
        whose
        output
        is fed to a loudspeaker 20. Thus the subject in the course of a
        sentic
        cycle hears each word selected from the set, and following each
        word,
        the
        subject then hears at time-spaced intervals a series of audible
        command
        clicks. </p>
      <p>The time spacing between clicks in a series thereof are
        preferably
        different
        for each emotion, but are distributed around a mean time
        suitably
        chosen
        for each emotion in a range of about 4 to 10 seconds. The number
        of
        clicks
        in the series thereof following each word representing an
        emotion also
        varies from emotion to emotion in the sentic cycle sequence, but
        typically
        lies in a range of about 20 to 40 clicks per series, though it
        may be
        less
        or more than that. </p>
      <p>The sentic forms or sentograms representing an emotion
        expressed
        in
        terms of finger pressure by the subject are displayed on screen
        21 of
        the
        computer terminal 22, the screen showing a sentic form 23. </p>
      <p>In the sentic cycler unit disclosed in my above-identified
        copending
        application, two control buttons are provided which permit the
        subject
        to either increase the number of time-spaced clicks in the
        series
        thereof
        which follow a word representing a particular emotion or to skip
        over
        clicks. </p>
      <p>When the subject at some intermediate point in the course of a
        click
        series presses the first control button, then the system reverts
        to the
        first click in the series, giving the subject an additional
        number of
        clicks
        to express the emotion represented by the word. But if the
        second
        button
        is pressed at an intermediate point in the series, then the
        remaining
        clicks
        are skipped and the system goes onto the next word in the
        sequence. </p>
      <p>In the computerized sentic cycle system in accordance with the
        invention,
        in lieu of buttons to effect prolongation of a click series or a
        skipping
        action, the mouse associated with the computer is adapted to
        carry out
        these functions, the mouse being a mobile manual device that
        controls
        movement
        of a cursor on the computer display. Depression of the mouse by
        the
        subject
        serves to effect the desired actions. Or the computer may
        include a
        voice-actuated
        switching arrangement which when the user says "repeat," this
        will
        cause
        the click series to repeat itself, but when the user says
        "skip," this
        will then terminate the click series and go on to the next word.
      </p>
      <p>The sentograms 23 displayed on screen 21 of the display
        terminal
        represent
        on-line sentic patterns produced each time the subject applies
        finger
        pressure
        to the transducer actuator in response to the series of
        time-spaced
        command
        clicks. </p>
      <p>The computer is also programmed to average the successive
        sentograms
        produced in response to a series of clicks. An average sentogram
        has a
        shape which may best characterize the subject's expression of a
        particular
        emotion, for one or more of the sentograms created in a given
        series
        may
        constitute aberrations. The averaged sentogram is supplied to an
        analyzer
        24 to determine maximum and minimum slopes, curvatures and
        amplitudes.
        These measurements can be compared in the analyzer with stored
        values.
        An index of similarity can be calculated from these measurements
        to
        inform
        the subject. </p>
      <p>Also provided is a recorder 25 to make of record the averaged
        sentograms
        produced by a subject in the course of a sentic cycle on a
        particular
        day,
        so that they may be compared with those produced in subsequent
        sessions,
        thereby making it possible to gauge the subject's progress. </p>
      <p>Observation of the sentic forms may be carried out by a trained
        analyst
        who is skilled in correlating the sentograms produced by a
        subject with
        specific states of emotion which may be "mixed states," to
        examine the
        appropriateness and significance of the expressions. </p>
      <p>In practice, sentograms may be recorded that reflect the
        emotional
        reaction
        of a subject to an individual about whom he has strong feelings
        or to
        imagined
        situations which release a negative emotion. Thus with some
        individuals,
        the sight of a snake or a bat may give rise to an intense phobic
        reaction.
        If the objective is to desensitize the subject or get rid of a
        particular
        phobia, then by comparing the sentograms produced by the subject
        on a
        particular
        day with those produced on subsequent days, one may be able to
        gauge
        the
        progress being made by the subject toward overcoming the phobia.
      </p>
      <p>The sentograms stored in the computer express an emotion such
        as
        love
        or anger in a sentic form that can serve to impart this emotion
        to
        various
        types of artistic activity. Thus with animated dancing figures
        created
        by computer-aided design techniques, a sentogram expressing a
        particular
        emotion can be so introduced into the graphics control of the
        animated
        figures as to cause the movements of the figures to express this
        emotion,
        or to change colors in corresponding dynamic ways. </p>
      <p>Or the sentic form for a particular emotion can be used to
        amplitude-modulate
        or otherwise directly or indirectly modify the wave form of
        reproduced
        music so that the music is more expressive of this emotion. If,
        for
        example,
        the emotion is that of grief, the sentogram for this emotion
        could be
        used
        to so modulate music so as to to render it sadder. And if the
        emotion
        is
        that of joy, its sentogram can be used to so modulate music as
        to
        enhance
        the sense of joy. </p>
      <p>It is to be understood that the musical performance which is
        reproduced
        is not devoid of emotional expression, for this depends on the
        nature
        of
        the music and the expressive ability of the performers. By
        imposing on
        the reproduced music aspects of the sentic form of a particular
        emotion,
        one is able to purify and/or intensify the emotion expressed by
        the
        music
        and heighten its effect on listeners. </p>
      <p>In practice, the forms and corresponding parameters disclosed
        in
        my
        music processing patents may be substituted or combined with
        sentograms
        to create "living" dance forms that harmonize emotionally with
        the
        music
        and are integral therewith, thereby largely dispensing with the
        need
        for
        choreography. </p>
      <p>A single or averaged sentogram stored in computer 11
        representing
        a
        particular emotion expressed by a subject can be communicated to
        other
        individuals in terms of physical movement corresponding to the
        shape of
        the sentogram. With such communication, one can realize
        beneficial
        effects
        not heretofore attainable with known devices imparting a
        physical
        movement
        to an individual. </p>
      <p>It is known to incorporate in a chair, a bed or a cradle to be
        occupied
        by an individual, an electrically-powered vibrator, the
        vibrations of
        which
        subject the occupant to periodic vibrations intended to relieve
        stress
        or to promote sleep. In some vibrators of this type, one can
        adjust the
        repetition rate or amplitude of the vibrations. But once an
        adjustment
        is made, the vibratory rate and amplitude remain substantially
        constant.
        Also known are vibrators which directly massage the body of an
        individual
        to relieve tension, to stimulate circulation and to obtain other
        beneficial
        effects. And in the practice of physiotherapy, a skilled masseur
        will
        so
        repetitively apply pressure to the body of a patient with his
        fingers
        as
        to relax the patient and reduce tension and stress. </p>
      <p>But whether the massaging pressures are applied by powered
        vibrators
        or manually, they do not induce in the individual being treated
        an
        emotion
        serving to create a sense, say, of loving care and warmth highly
        conducive
        to the release of tension and stress. This distinction is best
        understood
        by a simple analogy. A mother, in order to soothe her baby, will
        repetitively
        stroke the baby's body with her fingers and apply a gentle
        pressure in
        such a way as to express her love for the child. This technique,
        which
        is universally practiced, is highly effective. But while it
        would be
        possible
        to carry out a similar stroking action by mechanical means, the
        impersonal
        pressures applied thereby would not be nearly as effective. </p>
      <p>In the present invention, a transformer 28 responsive to a
        sentogram
        stored in computer 11 which has a shape representing an emotion
        to be
        communicated,
        such as love or reverence, is transformed into a corresponding
        physical
        movement of predetermined duration. To this end, the
        digitally-stored
        sentogram
        is converted into an analog signal which is expanded in time and
        then
        amplified
        and applied to an electromagnetically-operated mechanism. The
        armature
        or other movable element of the mechanism is caused to execute a
        movement
        in accordance with the shape of the sentogram. </p>
      <p>Transformer 28 is incorporated or coupled to a chair, bed or
        other
        device
        to be occupied by an individual to be treated, so as to
        repeatedly
        apply
        the sentogram movement to the individual to be treated. Thus in
        the
        case
        of a seat whose back is engaged by the back of the individual,
        the
        transformer
        is so coupled to the chair back as to cause it to move back and
        forth
        in
        compliance with the shape of the sentogram. </p>
      <p>In the case of a massaging vibrator which conventionally
        operates
        at
        a predetermined vibratory rate and amplitude, the motor of the
        vibrator
        will take the form of or be controlled by transformer 28 which
        then
        acts
        to modulate the amplitude of the periodic vibrations and/or the
        repetition
        rate thereof so that the vibratory movement then conforms to the
        sentogram
        shape. </p>
      <p>In this way, an individual subjected to a physical movement
        reflecting
        the shape of a sentogram expressing a particular emotion will
        have that
        emotion communicated to him. And if this emotion is of a nature
        conducive
        to the release of stress or tension, its effect will be
        salutary. </p>
      <p>In the case of a driver's seat in an automobile, it may be
        desirable
        at times that the emotion communicated to the occupant of this
        seat be
        such as to act as a stimulant to discourage the driver from
        falling
        asleep
        at the wheel. Thus the nature of the emotion communicated must
        be
        calculated
        to obtain the desired effect. </p>
      <p>Speech Modulation </p>
      <p>The invention is not limited to modulating the sounds of
        reproduced
        music with sentograms or sentic forms stored in the computer, as
        previously
        disclosed, to render the music more expressive. In practice, the
        reproduced
        sounds may take the form of speech or spoken messages digitally
        or
        otherwise
        stored in the computer, which are modulated by sentograms
        selected from
        the computer memory. Such modulation acts to impart to the
        reproduced
        speech
        the emotions represented by the selected sentograms. </p>
      <p>In human speech, there are two distinctly different sources of
        sound.
        One source is sounds which occur during so-called "voiced"
        speech, such
        as the vowels EE, AH and AW, as well as vowel-like consonants,
        such as
        W and M. Then the vocal chord vibrations break up the flow of
        air from
        the lungs into sharp pulses. These typically occur at a
        repetition rate
        of about 75 to 250 Hz, the sounds being rich in harmonics. The
        other
        source
        arises from "unvoiced" consonants, such as S and F, resulting in
        a hiss
        caused by air turbulence in the mouth. In speech synthesis, one
        seeks
        to
        create similar sounds. </p>
      <p>The Henderson U.S. Pat. No. 4,419,540 discloses a computer
        which
        incorporates
        a speech synthesizer to be used for educational purposes or as a
        language
        translator, the speech to be reproduced being digitally stored
        in the
        computer
        memory. Also known are computers in which speech messages are
        stored,
        which,
        when reproduced, supply operating instructions to the operator
        of the
        computer.
        Or the messages may be tied in with the computer program to
        guide the
        operator
        with respect to data presented on the computer display terminal.
        But
        whether
        the speech reproduced by the computer is for educational,
        instructional
        or for any other purpose, it has an inflexible quality. The
        characteristics
        of the reproduced speech are in no way accommodated to the
        personal
        requirements
        of the operator. </p>
      <p>From an ergonomic standpoint the placement of the control
        elements
        of
        a computer to be manipulated by an operator must take into
        account his
        physical limitations, and consideration must be given to the
        ability of
        an operator to see illuminated data on a computer display
        terminal
        without
        experiencing eye fatigue. However, little consideration has
        heretofore
        been given to the psychological effects of computer-generated
        speech on
        the operator or user of of the computer. </p>
      <p>The concern of human engineering or ergonomics is with those
        human
        characteristics
        that must be considered in designing a machine for human use in
        order
        that
        individuals and machines interact more effectively and safely.
        From a
        purely
        operational standpoint, the interaction between a computer and
        its
        human
        operator by way of reproduced speech to which the operator
        responds
        only
        dictates that the speech be clear and understandable. But when
        human
        engineering
        is applied to this interaction, the expressivity of the
        reproduced
        speech
        plays an important role in eliciting an effective human response
        to the
        speech and in reducing operator fatigue. </p>
      <p>Just as a teacher whose speech is warm, friendly, and
        responsive
        is
        more likely to gain the attention of his students and teach them
        more
        effectively
        than a teacher whose voice is rigid and forbidding, an effective
        interaction
        between a computer and its operator in which the operator is
        required
        to
        respond to computer-generated speech messages, is promoted when
        this
        speech
        is not mechanical and impersonal, but is appropriately and
        flexibly
        emotionally
        expressive. </p>
      <p>In a system in accordance with the invention, the reproduced
        sounds
        when in the form of speech messages issuing from a computer have
        flexible,
        emotionally-expressive qualities imparted thereto as part of a
        program
        whose character may also be selected by the operator. Thus some
        operators
        may prefer a voice that is commanding without being harsh, while
        others
        may prefer a gentler and sympathetic voice. </p>
      <p>The sentic forms or sentograms stored in the computer may be
        those
        reflective
        of basic or pure emotions, and they can be those of compound or
        mixed
        emotions.
        The latter are produced by telescoping two component emotions
        (rarely
        three).
        Telescoping is effected by a seamless joining of the two
        component
        emotion
        forms somewhere in the middle, so that the front section of one
        emotion
        form is joined to the rear section of the second emotion. The
        frequency
        and amplitude contours of the joined together sections must
        connect
        without
        a frequency glitch or amplitude glitch. For this purpose, use is
        made
        of
        a simple short splicing function (spline), thereby avoiding
        slope
        discontinuities.
        Or the sentogram reflecting a compound emotion may be derived
        through
        touch
        by an individual expressing this emotion. </p>
      <p>In practice, the sentic forms can be used to modulate speech in
        the
        following ways: </p>
      <p>(a) The amplitude contour of the sentic form can modulate the
        amplitude
        contour of the speech pattern which is covered in time by the
        sentic
        form.
        This will affect the relative accents as well as speech portions
        between
        accents. </p>
      <p>(b) The sentic form is placed along the speech pattern, but
        remains
        wedded to its own duration. That means that the speech pattern
        may be
        longer
        than the sentic form, in which case the sentic form is placed
        along the
        speech flow line in a suitable way, most frequently so that the
        speech
        ends together with the sentic form, but not necessarily so. It
        may also
        start together with it or be placed somewhere in the middle. For
        longer
        speech messages, several sentic forms would be placed along the
        speech
        flow, but not generally contiguously. </p>
      <p>There will quite often be an interval in which no sentic form
        is
        placed,
        so that sentic forms will be interspersed with non-sentic speech
        parts,
        which may be fairly short, however. For very short speech flows,
        only a
        portion of the sentic form might be traversed, in which case the
        silence
        which follows is pregnant with the form, implicitly, or
        explicitly in
        terms
        of breathing or other "noise." A second sentic form should not
        be
        started
        until the previous one's duration is completed. Otherwise
        inhibition of
        feeling and frustration will tend to occur. </p>
      <p>(c) The speech pattern needs to be modulated by the frequency
        curve
        of the sentic form; of course, synchronously with the amplitude
        contour
        of the sentic form. In this, the preexisting syntactic frequency
        movements
        (especially of the fundamental) must be preserved in altered
        form;
        i.e.,
        within the sentic frequency modulation pattern, either by
        addition or
        by
        multiplication; i.e., log function, or some intermediate,
        non-linear
        function.
        Existing special compression and dilation techniques known in
        the art
        may
        be used to preserve the independence of frequency changes from
        the
        speech
        tempo. The timing of this is similar to (b). The amplitude of
        the
        frequency
        contour is largely determined by the sentic form for each
        emotion, and
        varies comparatively little with the intensity of the emotion.
        In
        addition
        to the frequency contour, there is an offset (DC shift) in
        frequency
        that
        is different for each emotion. </p>
      <p>(d) An effective vibrato can be added to the voice in
        dynamically-related
        ways; e.g., as a dynamic function of the amplitude contour,
        where the
        vibrato
        is also modulated by parameters of the sentic form in its own
        rate as
        well
        as in its own amplitude. This is also related to the natural ten
        per
        second
        tremor (of muscle systems and of voice). The placement and
        character of
        the vibrato will vary for different emotions. </p>
      <p>(e) It is desirable also for optimal effect to change the
        timbre
        of
        the voice. This is also done as a dynamic function of the sentic
        form
        plus
        a DC shift, and differently for each emotion (e.g., for love in
        a
        relaxing
        direction, for anger tensing). In each case, the frequency
        spectrum of
        the voice is modulated to change it transiently to correspond to
        the
        requirements
        of the sentic form. A VCF (voltage-controlled-filter) can be
        used for
        this
        purpose; several may be used to cover the required changes in
        the
        frequency
        bands. They too will be used in relation to the sentic form
        (either the
        amplitude or the derivative of the sentic form), or a
        combination of
        the
        two can be used to modulate the timbre through a VCF or other
        electronic
        means, such as variable clipping of the speech. </p>
      <p>The vowels U, O and A are the most relaxed, I and E tense,
        consonants
        like plosives are easily tensed up; a variable treatment of
        consonants
        may be desirable for total optimization; however, much of the
        variation
        will be accounted for by the above factors alone. </p>
      <p>(f) The parameters of the sentic form can be used to modulate
        the
        timing
        of the speech so that selected portions of the speech accelerate
        or
        slow
        down according to the dictates of the sentic form. This
        stretching or
        compressing
        of the speech flow as part of the expression does not affect the
        duration
        of the sentic forms, but happens within them. The slope as well
        as
        amplitude
        of the sentic form can be involved as a guide to the timing
        changes of
        the speech. These speed changes need to be independently
        realized of
        voice
        frequency changes, as mentioned in (c) supra. </p>
      <p>The most effective expression of emotion occurs when the
        above-listed
        factors are combined. However, a graduated emotionalism can be
        applied
        to computer speech through an add-on of the various factors. For
        example,
        vibrato and timbre modulation can be added on to increase the
        emotionality
        in steps, or even frequency changes can be first left out, only
        the
        amplitude
        contour remaining. Thus a computer user could vary the effective
        intensity
        of emotionality displayed by the computer by simply choosing the
        number
        of add-on features to include. The computer could increase the
        intensity
        of emotion, not by increasing any factor, per se, but by the
        number of
        factors (dimensions) employed. The user could simply dial in on
        a
        speech
        emotion control panel "slightly emotional," "moderately
        emotional,"
        "very
        emotional"--according to his preference or need at the time. </p>
      <p>This may well be preferable to increasing, say, loudness or
        some
        other
        variable on its own. Clearly love is not expressed more
        effectively by
        greater loudness, although anger may be. Anger, however, can be
        effectively
        expressed with moderate loudness if the other variables are
        coordinatedly
        expressed. Loudness alone will not express anger unless the
        other
        factors
        are present also. However, as appropriately modulated whisper
        can
        express
        virtually all the emotions. With the coordinated shaping of
        emotional
        expression
        in the above-described manner, it becomes possible to produce
        computer-generated
        expressive speech exceeding in persuasiveness that of average
        human
        speech. </p>
      <p>Moving Sound Source </p>
      <p>By means of sentic-form modulation, a source of sound can be
        made
        to
        undergo movement in space, the sound source tracing out in space
        at an
        appropriate time scale, the trajectory of the sentic form. This
        may be
        realized either by actual movement of a single sound source in
        accordance
        with the sentic form or as an auditory effect produced through
        several
        stationary speakers at different spatial positions, the
        sentic-form
        modulation
        of the sounds produced by the respective speakers being
        coordinated in
        well-known ways as in stereophonic systems. </p>
      <p>Sound movements in accordance with the sentic form will act to
        communicate
        the corresponding emotional quality in one listener, thereby
        enhancing
        the emotional communication in an additional modality. This
        would be
        enhancing
        for cinema, television and for stage performances, especially
        for
        disembodied
        speech. </p>
      <p>While there has been shown and described a preferred embodiment
        of
        a
        computer system in accordance with the invention, it will be
        appreciated
        that many changes and modifications may be made therein without,
        however,
        departing from the essential spirit thereof. Thus sentograms can
        be
        obtained
        from other modalities as from brain functions directly. </p>
