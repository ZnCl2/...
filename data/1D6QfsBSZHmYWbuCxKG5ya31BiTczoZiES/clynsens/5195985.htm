      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>A self-sufficient sentic cycler unit usable by a subject to
        generate
        and express emotions as an art form of touch and in doing so to
        overcome
        inhibitive and repressive tendencies, and to relieve stress and
        dissipate
        anxiety. The unit includes a solid-state memory having digitally
        stored
        therein a set of words representing different emotions, such as
        love or
        anger, as well as a click or other command signal instructing
        the
        subject
        to tactilely express the emotion represented by the word
        selected from
        the memory. The memory is controlled by a clock and a programmed
        microprocessor
        to produce a sentic cycle in the course of which words are
        selected
        from
        the set in a predetermined sequence, each selected word being
        followed
        by a series of time-spaced clicks. The digital output of the
        memory is
        converted into an analog signal that is reproduced so that it
        can be
        heard
        by the subject. The unit is provided with a finger rest which is
        to be
        pressed by the subject who after hearing a selected word then
        hears a
        command
        click in the click series following the word. The subject, after
        hearing
        each click, then exerts finger pressure on the finger rest in a
        manner
        expressive of the emotion evoked by the word. </p>

      <b><i>Description</i></b>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to a technique for evoking in
        a
        subject
        generalized emotional states which are each expressed in tactile
        terms
        in the course of a sentic cycle and give rise to an emotional
        release
        having
        beneficial effects, and more particularly to a sentic cycler
        unit for
        carrying
        out this technique, the unit including a programmed
        microprocessor
        associated
        with a solid-state memory in which a set of words representing
        different
        emotions are digitally stored and are sequentially reproduced in
        accordance
        with the program. </p>
      <p>2. Status of Prior Art </p>
      <p>A concern of the present invention is with the relief of stress
        and
        the dissipation of anxiety by affording a subject with a natural
        means
        for emotional expression without the need for acquiring specific
        skills
        to attain this end. The utility of the invention is not limited
        to
        distressed
        subjects, for it may be used to enhance the mental state of
        normal
        subjects.
        A study of human emotions from the biocybernetic standpoint may
        be
        found
        in the text, "Biomedical Engineering Systems," edited by Clynes
        and
        Milsum
        (McGraw-Hill--1970). </p>
      <p>In studies reported in the above-identified text, the
        difficulties
        of
        measuring emotional characteristics quantitatively were overcome
        by
        normalizing
        expressions of emotion through measurement of touch-pressure
        transients
        in two dimensions produced by one finger of the subject, and by
        using
        internally-generated
        fantasized emotions. By requiring repetitive expressive acts for
        each
        emotion
        and averaging these acts on a computer, one derives from the
        transient
        pattern created by finger pressure, the expressive shape for the
        emotion
        generated through repetitive expressions. </p>
      <p>The use of a single finger to produce an expressive shape
        assumes
        the
        existence of a basic brain program for the expression of a given
        emotion.
        It is, however, immaterial whether a finger, foot or other body
        part is
        used in the expression. The consistent results obtained with
        this
        measurement
        technique confirms this supposition. </p>
      <p>My prior patent U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,922 (1973) discloses a
        system
        for
        producing a set of personalized sentograms constituting a
        personality
        relationship
        profile of a subject being diagnosed. This system includes a
        programmer
        in the form of a standard magnetic tape cassette player adapted
        to
        present
        to the subject a predetermined sequence of names, each
        identifying an
        individual
        with whom the subject has a close relationship or about whom the
        subject
        has distinct feelings. After a name is presented, the subject is
        commanded
        by a signal to express his feeling about the named individual by
        pressing
        with his finger a finger rest on a pressure-sensitive transducer
        to
        produce
        a transient wave form whose shape reflects this feeling. The
        shapes
        initiated
        by a series of command signals are averaged to created a
        personalized
        sentogram.
        The set of sentograms resulting from the sequence of names
        provides a
        personality
        relationship profile of the subject useful in diagnosis and
        prognosis.
        The present invention does not seek to provide sentograms but
        serves to
        employ the tactile expression of emotions for beneficial
        purposes. By
        evoking
        repetitive expressive acts for each emotion and averaging these
        acts on
        a computer, one derives from the transient pattern created by
        finger
        pressure,
        the expressive shape for the emotion. </p>
      <p>The use of a single finger to produce an expressive shape
        assumes
        the
        existence of a basic brain program for the expression of a given
        emotion.
        It is, however, immaterial whether a finger, foot or other body
        part is
        used in the expression. The consistent results obtained with
        this
        measurement
        technique confirms this supposition. </p>
      <p>My prior patent U.S. Pat. No. 3,755,922 (1973) discloses a
        system
        for
        producing a set of personalized sentograms constituting a
        personality
        relationship
        profile of a subject being diagnosed. This system includes a
        programmer
        in the form of a standard magnetic tape cassette player adapted
        to
        present
        to the subject a predetermined sequence of names, each
        identifying an
        individual
        with whom the subject has a close relationship or about whom the
        subject
        has distinct feelings. After a name is presented, the subject is
        commanded
        by a signal to express his feeling about the named individual by
        pressing
        with his finger a finger rest on a pressure-sensitive transducer
        to
        produce
        a transient wave form whose shape reflects this feeling. The
        shapes
        initiated
        by a series of command signals are averaged to created a
        personalized
        sentogram.
        The set of sentograms resulting from the sequence of names
        provides a
        personality
        relationship profile of the subject useful in diagnosis and
        prognosis.
        The present invention does not seek to provide sentograms but
        serves to
        employ the tactile expression of emotions for beneficial
        purposes. </p>
      <p>Hence of greater relevance is my prior patent U.S. Pat. No.
        3,691,652
        (1972), where in order to enhance the ability of a subject to
        express
        emotions
        freely and to overcome his inhibitive and repressive tendencies,
        a
        system
        is provided for generating generalized emotional states by way
        of
        repeated
        random signal initiations and expressive touch. The subject goes
        through
        a programmed sequence of generalized states of emotion in the
        course of
        a sentic cycle whose duration is, say, 30 minutes. Such sentic
        cycles
        have
        been found to have a calming effect on the subject and to result
        in a
        lessening
        of stress and anxiety. </p>
      <p>A more detailed analysis of sentic cycles is found in chapter 5
        of
        the
        text "Emotion and Psychopathology," edited by M. Clynes and J.
        Panksepp,
        Plenum Press, New York 1988, this chapter being headed
        "Generalized
        Emotion,
        How It is Produced and Sentic Cycle Therapy." Appendix A in this
        chapter
        gives "Timings for The Start of Expressions for Sentic Cycles
        (soft
        clicks)." </p>
      <p>As in my '922 patent, in the system disclosed in my '652
        patent,
        the
        subject is called upon to express the quality of a sentic state
        given
        in
        a word approximation, such as love, hate, anger, grief, sex and
        reverence.
        This state is physically expressed by pressing a finger rest
        actuating
        a pressure-sensitive transducer whose output is converted to a
        sentic
        expressive
        transient shape exhibited on a TV screen or other visual
        indicator. In
        both of my patents, in order to present in sequence the words
        representing
        the emotions, each of which is followed by a command signal, use
        is
        made
        of a conventional magnetic tape cassette player. </p>
      <p>The system disclosed in my prior '652 patent is relatively
        elaborate
        and costly, and by no means portable. Hence the subject, in
        order to
        obtain
        the benefit of the system, must attend a facility having the
        necessary
        equipment. This rules out the use by the subject of the system
        at home
        or at whatever other site suits his convenience and needs. </p>
      <p>Inasmuch as a sentic cycler unit in accordance with the
        invention
        makes
        use of a microelectronic system having a solid-state memory to
        store
        the
        words and signals necessary for a sentic cycle, the following
        prior art
        patents are of background interest. </p>
      <p>The Shirf et al. patent U.S. Pat. No. 3,803,535 and the DeSmet
        patent
        U.S. Pat. No. 4,884,974 both disclose solid-state devices in
        which
        words
        and sound effects are digitally stored in a read-only memory
        chip or
        ROM.
        A ROM is a non-volatile memory which once its discrete storage
        sites
        are
        loaded, the data stays therein even if the power is shut off. In
        order
        to load the ROM, spoken words and sound effects are first
        recorded to
        produce
        an audio waveform which is then sampled at a high sampling rate.
        Each
        sample
        is then digitized and stored as a binary value in a ROM site.
        Then in
        order
        to extract the stored sounds from the ROM and reconstruct the
        audio
        waveform,
        the stored digital values are read out from the ROM and fed in
        sequence
        as input signals to a digital-to-analog converter. </p>
      <p>Message extraction from a ROM is effected by a start-of-message
        signal
        applied to an electronic clock which then generates a train of
        periodic
        clock pulses that are applied to a counter that causes the
        memory sites
        in the ROM where the digitized samples of the message are
        stored, to be
        read out in sequence. The digitized sample signals yielded by
        the ROM
        are
        fed to a D-to-A converter whose output is a stepped analog
        waveform.
        This
        is applied to a low-pass filter to smooth out the transitions in
        the
        stepped
        wave to produce an audio signal resembling the original audio
        signal.
        This
        audio signal is amplified and reproduced so that it can be heard
        by the
        user. </p>

      <p>SUMMARY OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>The main object of this invention is to provide a
        self-sufficient
        sentic
        cycler unit adapted in the course of a sentic cycle to evoke in
        a
        subject
        a series of generalized emotional states which are each
        expressed in
        tactile
        terms and gives rise as with music to an emotional release
        having
        beneficial
        effects. </p>
      <p>A significant advantage of a sentic cycler unit in accordance
        with
        the
        invention as compared to the system disclosed in my prior '922
        patent
        is
        that it is highly compact and portable, and may be used by a
        subject at
        home or whatever other site suits his convenience and needs.
        Another
        advantage
        of this unit is that it does away with the need to visually
        represent
        sentic
        waveforms, for these waveforms play no role in obtaining an
        emotional
        release. </p>
      <p>More specifically, an object of this invention is to provide a
        battery-powered
        sentic cycler unit constituted by a programmed microprocessor
        associated
        with a solid-state memory, so that the unit may be used at any
        site,
        whether
        or not a power source is there available. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of this invention is to provide a sentic
        cycler
        unit
        in which each reproduced word derived from the memory
        representing a
        particular
        emotion is followed by a series of time-spaced command signals
        or
        clicks
        instructing the subject to exert finger pressure on a finger
        rest in a
        manner expressing this emotion, whereby the subject continues to
        express
        this emotion in response to each click in the series. </p>
      <p>A salient feature of the invention resides in a unit having two
        button
        controls, one of which when actuated at some point in the series
        of
        time-spaced
        clicks following a particular reproduced word, causes the sentic
        cycler
        unit to revert to the first click in the series, whereby the
        subject
        can
        then repeatedly express the same emotion for an additional
        number of
        times.
        The second button, when actuated at some point in the series of
        clicks,
        causes the unit to skip over the remaining clicks in the series
        and to
        reproduce the next word in the sequence. And if the second
        button is
        actuated
        at the end of a sentic cycle, the entire cycle is repeated. </p>
      <p>Also an object of the invention is to provide a highly compact
        unit
        which operates efficiently and reliably and can be mass produced
        at low
        cost so that its therapeutic benefits can be made widely
        available. </p>
      <p>Briefly stated, these objects are attained in a self-sufficient
        sentic
        cycler unit usable by a subject to generate and express emotions
        as an
        art form of touch, and in doing so to overcome inhibitive and
        repressive
        tendencies, and to relieve stress and dissipate anxiety. The
        unit
        includes
        a solid-state memory having digitally stored therein a set of
        words
        representing
        different emotions, such as love or anger, as well as a click or
        other
        command signal instructing the subject to tactilely express the
        emotion
        represented by the word selected from the memory. The memory is
        controlled
        by a clock and a programmed microprocessor to produce a sentic
        cycle in
        the course of which words are selected from the set in a
        predetermined
        sequence, each selected word being followed by a series of
        time-spaced
        clicks. </p>
      <p>The digital output of the memory is converted into an analog
        signal
        that is reproduced so that it can be heard by the subject. The
        unit is
        provided with a finger rest which is to be pressed by the
        subject who
        after
        hearing a selected word then hears a command click in the click
        series
        following the word. The subject, after hearing each word, then
        exerts
        finger
        pressure on the finger rest in a manner expressive of the
        emotion
        evoked
        by the word. </p>
      <p>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS </p>
      <p>For a better understanding of the invention as well as other
        objects
        and further features thereof, reference is made to the following
        detailed
        description to be read in conjunction with the accompanying
        drawing,
        wherein: </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 1</b> is a perspective view of a sentic cycler unit in
        accordance
        with the invention; and </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 2</b> is a block diagram of the microelectronic system
        included
        in the unit. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>The Unit </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a preferred embodiment
        of
        a
        sentic cycler unit in accordance with the invention. The unit is
        housed
        in a shallow casing molded of synthetic plastic material of
        high-strength,
        such as polypropylene or nylon. The casing has the shape of a
        flattened
        egg and is so compact that it can be clutched in one hand.
        Casing 10 is
        formed of separable complementary lower and upper sections which
        can be
        pried apart to permit batteries to be loaded therein. </p>
      <p>Integral with the upper section of casing 10 at about its
        center
        is
        a raised finger rest 11. Rest 11 is provided at its central zone
        with a
        region formed of a slightly elastomeric or "giving" material.
        Hence
        when
        this region is engaged by the ball of a finger of the subject,
        such as
        the middle finger 12 shown in FIG. 1, this region yields
        somewhat when
        subjected to heavy pressure. In this way, the subject receives
        the
        impression
        that the finger rest is responsive to the applied pressure. The
        manner
        in which finger pressure is applied and the degree of pressure
        reflects
        the emotion expressed by the subject in relation to the selected
        word.
        The pressure pattern is generally consistent in response to a
        given
        word,
        but it differs from word to word. Thus the degree of finger
        pressure
        and
        how it is applied to the finger rest to physically express the
        emotion
        for the word "love" will be quite different from that applied to
        the
        finger
        rest to express the emotion "hate." </p>
      <p>The upper section is also provided with buttons or
        touch-sensitive
        switches
        B.sub.2 and B.sub.2 whose function will be later described.
        These
        buttons
        are adjacent the fingers of the subject so that they may be
        actuated by
        a finger other than the one then engaging the finger rest. The
        sentic
        cycler
        unit is also provided with a small loudspeaker, say, of a
        one-inch
        diameter,
        from which is heard in sequence during the course of each sentic
        cycle
        emotion-representing words such as "love," "hate," or "anger,"
        each
        word
        being followed by a series of time-spaced clicking sounds or
        other
        command
        signals instructing the subject to express by finger pressure
        the
        emotion
        evoked by the selected word. </p>
      <p>The speaker may be mounted on the lower section of the casing
        facing
        the supporting surface on which the unit rests. The lower
        section is
        provided
        at its undersurface with cushioning pads or feet which also
        serve to
        prevent
        the unit from sliding on this surface. </p>
      <p>In practice, it is best that the subject make use of the sentic
        cycler
        unit in a sitting position, and for this purpose the compact
        unit can
        be
        placed on a coffee table, or on the armrest of a chair. Also,
        instead
        of
        a loudspeaker, an outlet jack may be provided for earphones. </p>
      <p>The System </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 2 showing the microelectronic system
        included
        in the unit, it will be seen that the system includes a
        read-only-memory
        ROM 13. Digitally stored in ROM 13 are the set of words required
        for a
        sentic cycle lasting about 30 minutes, typically, "no emotion,"
        "anger,"
        "hate," "grief," "love," "sex," "joy" and "reverence." Also
        digitally
        stored
        in ROM 13 is the sound of a command click such as that produced
        by a
        soft
        knock on a piece of wood or any other abrupt sound signal acting
        to
        command
        the subject to apply finger pressure to the finger rest to
        physically
        express
        the emotion the subject feels that is represented by the
        selected word
        in the sequence. </p>
      <p>ROM 13 is controlled by a microprocessor 14 associated with an
        electronic
        clock 15. A microprocessor is a central control unit on a single
        integrated
        circuit chip. Each microprocessor has its own architecture which
        encompasses
        the general layout of its major components. These components,
        which
        constitute
        the hardware of the microprocessor, include a program counter, a
        register,
        an arithmetic/logic unit, bus control and an internal memory or
        stack.
        Besides the hardware is the instruction set or software, the
        program of
        which takes the form of a set of logically related instructions
        stored
        in the internal memory of the microprocessor. </p>
      <p>The program of microprocessor 14, as governed by clock 15, is
        such
        as
        to extract at predetermined times from ROM 13 in the course of
        each
        sentic
        cycle, successive words in the word set digitally stored in the
        ROM,
        each
        word being followed by a series of time-spaced clicks to command
        the
        subject
        to respond to the previously extracted word. The digital output
        of ROM
        13 is converted by a D-to-A converter 16 into a corresponding
        analog
        signal.
        This analog signal, which is in stepped form, after suitable
        filtering,
        is applied to an amplifier 17 whose output is fed to a
        loudspeaker 18.
        Thus the subject in the course of a sentic cycle hears each word
        selected
        from the set, and after each word, the subject hears at spaced
        intervals
        the series of command clicks. </p>
      <p>In practice, ROM 13, microprocessor 14, clock 15 and D/A
        converter
        16
        may be integrated into a single chip. Typically, this chip can
        be an
        ESS
        3000 chip or one similar thereto. The unit is powered by a
        battery pack
        19 preferably made up of AAA cells of the alkaline type or of
        the
        rechargeable
        nickel cadmium type. </p>
      <p>The time spacing between clicks in a series thereof are
        preferably
        different
        for each emotion, but are distributed around a mean time
        appropriate
        for
        each emotion in a range of 4 to 10 seconds. The number of clicks
        in the
        series thereof following each word representing an emotion also
        varies
        from emotion to emotion in the sentic cycle sequence, but lies
        in a
        range
        of about 20 to 40 clicks per series. </p>
      <p>The function of buttons B.sub.1 and B.sub.2 will now be
        explained.
        Both
        buttons or touch-sensitive switches are associated with
        microprocessor
        14. When button B.sub.1 is actuated in the course of a series of
        time-spaced
        clicks that follows the reproduction of a word in the sequence,
        the
        system
        then reverts to the first click in the series. This action gives
        the
        subject
        an additional number of clicks to express the emotion
        represented by
        the
        preceding word. </p>
      <p>Thus if the word is "love," and button B.sub.1 is actuated
        after
        the
        subject has already responded to 12 clicks in a series of 20,
        then the
        subject will now hear a series of 20 clicks; hence the total
        number of
        clicks following the word "love" is 32. In this way, the subject
        can
        prolong
        a particular emotion-response phase for as long as he desires.
        This
        freedom
        to prolong a given phase is useful to a subject who may feel
        that he or
        she on a particular occasion needs more time to express and
        enjoy a
        specific
        emotion. </p>
      <p>In other instances, the subject may feel that in repeatedly
        expressing
        a particular emotion in response to the series of clicks
        following the
        word representing this emotion, that this expression has been
        sufficient
        when expressing this emotion, say, to the 12th click in a 20
        click
        series,
        or the subject may not wish, on this occasion, to express, say,
        hate,
        or
        he may be pressed for time. The subject may then wish to skip
        the
        remaining
        clicks in the series and go on to the next word in the sequence.
        This
        skipping
        action is effected by actuating button B.sub.2 which, when
        pressed,
        causes
        the microprocessor to read out from ROM 13 the next word in the
        sequence. </p>
      <p>Button B.sub.2 can also be used to effect a repeat of the
        entire
        sentic
        cycle. By pressing button B.sub.2 at the conclusion of a sentic
        cycle,
        it will cause the microprocessor to read out from ROM 13 the
        first word
        in the sentic cycle sequence, causing the unit to repeat the
        cycle. </p>
      <p>It has been found that at the completion of a sentic cycle,
        that
        the
        catharsis resulting from expressing a spectrum of emotions
        serves to
        relax
        the subject and to relieve his tensions without, however,
        diminishing
        his
        energy level. Indeed, it may heighten this level. Because the
        subject,
        who has had the benefit of the sentic cycle, is then
        substantially free
        of stress and anxiety, he is able to sleep better. Moreover, the
        subject,
        by continuing to use the unit over a period of weeks, learns to
        get in
        touch with the full range of his emotions and to discriminate
        among
        emotions
        and thereby relate more effectively with others in a more
        natural
        fashion. </p>
      <p>The sentic cycler unit does not indicate or measure the dynamic
        sentic
        shapes evoked by the subject, nor does it indicate how well the
        subject
        has performed, for these are irrelevant to the beneficial
        function of
        the
        unit. </p>
      <p>To render the unit usable universally, stored in the ROM are
        the
        seven
        to nine or more words in the set which normally make up a sentic
        cycle
        given in several languages, such as English, French, German,
        Russian,
        Japanese,
        Spanish and Italian. The ROM selected for this purpose must, of
        course,
        have a sufficient storage capacity for storing all of the words
        in the
        set in several languages. In this arrangement, the
        microprocessor must
        be associated with a language-selector switch or other enabling
        device. </p>
      <p>Each click has a duration of 5 to 25 milliseconds, and the
        silent
        intervals
        between clicks are typically 4 to 10 seconds. Thus the unit has
        a very
        small duty cycle, for it is silent more than 99 percent of the
        time.
        The
        unit therefore consumes relatively little power and is operable
        for a
        prolonged
        period before it becomes necessary to replace or recharge the
        batteries. </p>
      <p>Typically, the feeling of well being and calm imparted to the
        subject
        by the sentic cycler unit will last about 24 hours. It is
        recommended,
        therefore, that the subject use the unit three to five times a
        week.
        Under
        periods of stress, more frequent use may be desirable. </p>
      <p>While stress relief and the dissipation of anxiety are obtained
        through
        the unit, it is also beneficial to those individuals who are
        relatively
        free of stress, for it enhances their sense of well being.
        Because the
        unit weighs only a few ounces and is highly compact, it can
        easily be
        carried
        in a pocket or purse. </p>
      <p>An individual's ability to mentally control certain of his
        physiological
        functions such as body temperature or blood pressure is known as
        self-regulation.
        But with the exception of those committed to transcendental
        meditation,
        self-regulation techniques have not been widely practiced in
        Western
        society,
        possibly because many disorders induced or aggravated by stress
        which
        lend
        themselves to alleviation by self-regulation can more readily be
        treated
        by medication. Thus a tension headache as well as a migraine (a
        vascular
        headache more painful than a tension headache) can, to some
        degree, be
        relieved by aspirin and other drugs. Such medication does not,
        however,
        do away with stress factors responsible for the headache but
        serves
        only
        to moderate the symptoms. Moreover, aspirin and other drugs,
        when taken
        frequently and in large doses, often have deleterious side
        effects. </p>
      <p>Emotional feelings are reflected in physiological activity.
        When
        an
        individual is angry, this feeling may be accompanied by changes
        in
        pulse
        rate, blood pressure and body temperature, and also by reactive
        physical
        movements. Thus an angry individual often clenches his fist. </p>
      <p>In the context of a sentic cycler unit in accordance with the
        invention,
        anger is physically expressed by finger pressure imposed on the
        finger
        rest. And one reason the unit acts to relieve stress and have a
        calming
        effect on the subject is that an emotion such as anger is not
        suppressed
        but is released in the form of finger pressure. </p>
      <p>However, anger is but one of several primary emotions, and with
        the
        sentic cycler unit, a spectrum of emotions is traversed in the
        course
        of
        each sentic cycle, both positive and negative. </p>
      <p>A sentic cycler unit of the above-described type is passive in
        the
        sense
        that when a subject responds to a command click by applying
        finger
        pressure
        to the finger rest, apart from a slight yielding of the rest,
        the unit
        does not otherwise react to the applied pressure. The reaction
        which
        does
        occur takes place in the consciousness of the subject as he
        experiences
        an emotion evoked by the selected word and expresses this
        emotion by a
        finger action. </p>
      <p>In order, therefore, to render the unit interactive, one may
        associate
        with the finger rest a pressure-sensitive switch which is
        actuated
        whenever
        the rest is pressed by the subject's finger, regardless of the
        degree
        of
        applied pressure. This switch is coupled to the microprocessor,
        and the
        system is so arranged that when a command click is heard
        following a
        selected
        word, and the subject then applies finger pressure to the rest
        to
        express
        the emotion represented by the word, the subject then hears a
        musical
        tone,
        phrase, chord or sound expressive of this emotion.
        Alternatively, the
        click
        itself may initiate the emotional sound. </p>
      <p>Thus if the selected word is "grief," the musical tone then
        produced
        could be a dark cello sound suggestive of grief. And if the
        selected
        word
        is "love," then an appropriate musical phrase could be a soft
        violin
        sound,
        while for the word "anger," a growling tone produced by a tuba
        could be
        used. All of these sounds could be expressed with characteristic
        sentic
        forms (See: Clynes '773 and '992 patents). </p>
      <p>The purpose of this musical sound is to create an aural
        environment
        serving to induce in the subject an emotional feeling
        appropriate to
        the
        selected word. The set of musical tones, phrases, chords or
        other
        sounds
        appropriate to the spectrum of words representing emotions are
        also
        stored
        in the ROM, and the microprocessor is programmed to respond to
        the
        finger
        rest switch action by extracting from the ROM the sound
        expression
        appropriate
        to the particular emotion to be then expressed by the subject
        upon
        hearing
        the command click following the selected word. The duration of
        the
        tones
        preferably corresponds to major portions of the intervals
        between
        command
        clicks so that the tones are played during the series of clicks
        following
        the selected word. The sounds so produced may be provided with
        every
        second
        or third touch expression, rather than with every single touch
        expression. </p>
      <p>Art Form of Touch </p>
      <p>With a sentic cycler unit in accordance with the invention, as
        the
        subject
        continues to use the unit, he can in doing so develop his own
        artistic
        touch, for the manner in which he presses the finger rest
        depends on
        his
        emotional feelings and how they are translated into finger
        motion. In
        developing
        and applying his own "touch," the subject will in this process
        gain
        measure
        of aesthetic satisfaction and improve the communication of
        feelings to
        others. </p>
      <p>The practice of sentic cycles may therefore be regarded as a
        simple
        art form of touch. The sequence and timing of emotions and their
        expressions
        is given--this representing the composition. However, the
        emotions are
        not those of a composer, but those of the individual who
        practices the
        art form of touch. Improvisatory and spontaneous expressiveness
        and
        thought
        are combined with a program or metastructure (the series and
        duration
        of
        each emotion phase). </p>
      <p>This art form of touch resides in the discovery, by each
        person,
        of
        the most appropriate and effective dynamic form of expressing an
        emotion,
        and sensing how that expression generates the emotion. Having
        found and
        sensed this, the person can then apply it to other situations
        and
        modes,
        thereby increasing the "livingness" (to use Susan Langer's term)
        of
        their
        communication and experience, and become more authentic. </p>
      <p>This art teaches an individual how easily he or she can switch
        from
        one emotion to another, at will, and how such a sequence of
        emotions
        results
        in an overall impression greater than the sum of the parts. It
        impresses
        on the person how emotions are embedded in time, how time is
        part of
        the
        expression, communication and experience of emotion. And finally
        it can
        teach also how we may "consider" emotion and its quality,
        without
        becoming
        totally involved bodily, so that its timeless aspects are also
        perceived,
        as an existential entity. </p>
      <p>In this (seemingly uniquely human) mode, called Apollonian (as
        distinguished
        from the more usual Dionysian mode), it becomes possible also to
        view
        the
        cognitive substrates of each emotion and become cognizant of
        them free
        from the constraints experienced in everyday life. Like other
        true art
        forms, the art form of touch is conducive to empathy and
        compassion.
        But
        unlike the visual and musical arts, the touch art of sentic
        cycles can
        be effectively learned in a relatively short period. </p>
      <p>While there has been shown and described a preferred embodiment
        of
        a
        sentic cycler unit in accordance with the invention, it will be
        appreciated
        that many changes and modifications may be made therein without,
        however,
        departing from the essential spirit thereof. </p>
