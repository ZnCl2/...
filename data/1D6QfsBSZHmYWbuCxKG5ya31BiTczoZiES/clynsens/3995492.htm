      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>An isometric exerciser formed by a pair of spaced bodies joined
        together by a link associated with a transducer and ensheathed
        in a cover to define a structure having a generally oblong
        configuration. By grasping the ends of the exerciser in his
        hands, a user is able to exert a compressive or tension force on
        the transducer. The transducer converts this force into a
        corresponding electrical value that is applied to a pulse
        generator coupled to a loudspeaker housed within the structure,
        thereby producing a train of audible pulses whose repetition
        rate, tone and amplitude depend on the applied force. Thus the
        user receives a continuous audible feedback, permitting him to
        adjust the applied force to a desired level. By means of a
        counter responsive to the output of the pulse generator, one is
        able to score the user's performance. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to the development of muscular
        skills, and more particularly to a hand-held isometric exerciser
        that is usable to execute various arm and other movements, the
        exerciser generating audible signals which reflect the degree of
        pressure or tension exerted by the user. </p>
      <p>Exercisers based on isometric principles require the user to
        strain his muscles against an immovable object for a short time
        period so that the user is able to experience a large muscle
        strain at a constant muscle length. As a consequence, the fiber
        links of the muscles remain constant or in isometric
        contraction, thereby improving muscular development and tone. </p>
      <p>Despite the gains in muscle strength and development obtainable
        through isometric exercising, existing devices for this purpose
        fail to give satisfactory results, for the benefit of exercising
        tends to diminish rather than increase with continued use. </p>
      <p>The coordinated brain control of the muscles are such as to
        defeat the function of ordinary isometric exercisers. The reason
        for this is that the user learns and his conscious or
        unconscious mental process adapts to the fact that however much
        effort the muscles exert in either pulling or pushing against an
        immovable object, the object will not move. Hence, when
        continuing to perform isometric exercises with conventional
        devices, a point is quickly reached where brain control
        recognizes the futility of having the muscles strain to move an
        immovable object, and it causes what amounts to an involuntary
        release of muscle strain. </p>
      <p>Another drawback characteristic of existing types of isometric
        exercisers is the restriction it imposes on body movement. The
        typical exerciser precludes or limits arm and leg movement, as a
        result of which continued use of the exerciser gives rise to
        tedium. Though the user is aware of the physical benefits to be
        gained by isometric exercising, boredom discourages him from
        persisting in this form of exercise. Moreover, conventional
        exercising serves only to improve a limited set of muscles and
        neglect many others important to proper muscular development. </p>
      <p>Another factor which militates against the use of conventional
        isometric exercisers is the absence of diversion or sports
        activity. In sports, one develops skills and improves physical
        fitness in competition with other players. But with isometric
        exercisers of the known type, the user merely exerts muscle
        power without regard to the power exercised by another user and
        therefore without any incentive to improve his power and skill
        against that of a competitor. </p>
      <p>The difficulties experienced with isometric exercisers are
        encountered with most other non-competitive exercising devices,
        for such exercising activity can be psychologically depressive
        and unrewarding. Thus while one who rows a boat has the
        satisfaction of movement and of reaching a destination, the user
        of a rowing machine goes nowhere and finds it difficult,
        therefore, to sustain this monotonous exercise. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In view of the foregoing, the main object of this invention is
        to provide an isometric exerciser in which the effort exerted by
        the user against a seemingly-immovable object is reflected by an
        audible signal whose nature varies as a function of the applied
        force. </p>
      <p>Because of the correlation between the nature of the audible
        signal and the applied pulling or pushing force, the exerciser
        affords continuous feedback. Thus the user is positively
        reinforced or rewarded rather than frustrated, and while the
        application of force produces no perceptible movement of the
        object against which it is exerted, its translation into an
        audible signal causes the user's brain control to recognize the
        performance of the muscles. As a result, continued use of the
        exerciser gives rise to increasing rather than diminishing
        benefits. </p>
      <p>Also an object of the invention is to provide a highly compact
        exerciser which is holdable between the hands whereby as the
        user exerts pressure or tension thereon, he can at the same time
        execute a large variety of free arm and other movements. Because
        of its maneuverability, the benefits derived from the exerciser
        encompass the kinematic as well as the isometric field. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of this invention is to provide an exerciser
        which is usable as a sporting device to play competitive games
        in the course of which the players gain agility and skill as
        well as improving their muscular development and tone. </p>
      <p>Briefly stated, these objects are attained in an exerciser
        formed by a pair of spaced bodies which are joined together by a
        link associated with a transducer, these elements being
        ensheathed by a yieldable cover to define a structure having an
        oblong configuration that is holdable between the hands of a
        user. </p>
      <p>By grasping the ends of the exerciser, a user is able to exert
        a compressive or tension force on the link, depending on whether
        the user tries to pull the bodies apart or to push them
        together. The transducer associated with the link converts the
        physical force to which it is subjected into a corresponding
        electrical value. This value is applied to a pulse generator
        coupled to a loudspeaker housed within the structure, thereby
        producing a train of audible pulses whose repetition rate, tone
        and amplitude depend on the strength of the applied force. Thus
        the user receives a continuous audible feedback which permits
        him to adjust the force being applied to the exerciser to a
        desired level. The sound also gives the user a sense of
        satisfaction when it acquires a character indicative of the
        optimum force for a given exercise. </p>
      <p>By conveying the generated pulses to a scoring system that
        includes a counter, one obtains an achievement score, making it
        possible for the user to pit his skill and strength against a
        competitor. Because the exerciser is compact and easily held,
        one is able to swing the exerciser through circular and other
        patterns of arm movement while the hands continue to apply a
        steady force thereto. As these maneuvers are executed, the user,
        by means of the audible signal, is able to maintain the desired
        degree of pressure. </p>

        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION </p>
      <p>Referring now to the drawing and more particularly to FIG. 1,
        there is shown a preferred embodiment of an exerciser in
        accordance with the invention, the exerciser being constituted
        by a pair of ball-shaped bodies 10 and 11 in spaced relation,
        the bodies being joined together by a link 12. Associated with
        link 12 is a pressure-sensitive transducer 13. </p>
      <p>These elements are ensheathed in a removable mantle or cover 14
        to define a structure having a generally oblong configuration.
        In practice, the total length of the structure is preferably
        less than 12 inches, so that the ends may easily be grasped by
        the hands of a user while the exerciser is manipulated in
        various ways to be later described. In practice, bodies 10 and
        11 at the ends of the structure may be contoured or ridged to
        provide more grippable surfaces resisting slippage. </p>
      <p>Though the bodies and link therebetween are of rigid material,
        preferably of molded plastic, the cover 13 is not a hard
        unyielding surface but has a natural feel which is obtained, for
        example, by a fabric having a wool, plush or fur pile, by padded
        leatherette or by a stretch fabric laminated to flexible foam
        plastic material. </p>
      <p>The cover is provided with a zippered fly so that one has
        access to the interior structure for replacing batteries or
        repair. The texture of the cover surface is preferably such as
        to provide a pleasurable, or sensuous tactile experience, and it
        should be washable and replaceable so that different cover
        textures and colors may be provided to satisfy individual
        tastes. </p>
      <p>Transducer 12 may be any device capable of converting the
        applied compression or tension force into a corresponding
        electrical value. For this purpose, use may be made of a
        piezoelectric pressure-responsive element, a strain gauge, a
        carbon powder device, a solid-state pressure transducer or other
        suitable means. </p>
      <p>When the user pushes against the pads of the exerciser, as
        shown in FIG. 2, an electrical value is generated by the
        transducer which reflects the applied compressive force. And
        when the user pulls the ends of the exerciser apart, as shown in
        FIG. 3, tension is then applied to the transducer, the
        electrical value produced thereby being an analog function of
        the applied tension. But since an applied tension will have the
        reverse effect on the transducer, a tension force equal to a
        pressure force will produce a transducer output of the same
        magnitude but of opposite sign. </p>
      <p>In order, therefore, to provide an audible output which is
        independent of the direction of the applied force, a switch is
        provided that is responsive to the direction of the force
        applied to the structure to reverse the output of the transducer
        when it is subjected to tension. Thus when an applied tension
        force is equal in magnitude to an applied compression force, the
        output will be the same both in magnitude and sign. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, to obviate the need for a switch, the transducer
        may be in the form of a pair of sensitive elements providing
        equal outputs of opposite sign, so that when pressure is
        applied, one element produces a positive-going voltage while the
        other produces a negative-going voltage, whereas when tension is
        applied, the reverse output voltages are obtained. By
        associating the two elements of the transducer with an
        appropriate rectifying demodulator, one can exclude the
        negative-going voltages and obtain from the combined elements a
        positive-going voltage both in compression and tension. </p>
      <p>Also included is a battery-operated pulse-generating system,
        preferably in integrated circuit form and generally designated
        by numeral 15, which converts the transducer output value to an
        audible signal whose nature is indicative of the applied force.
        This system, as well as a battery 16 therefor, is housed in a
        suitable casing contained in the structure, the casing including
        a hatch to provide access thereto to replace the battery. The
        output of the system is applied to a miniature loudspeaker 17
        mounted on the wall of the casing so that it can be easily heard
        by the user. </p>
      <p>Because of the compact structure, it becomes possible to apply
        a steady, controlled pressure or tension to the ends thereof,
        while concurrently executing various free movements, so that
        body control as well as muscle development may be improved in
        the course of practice. The exerciser lends itself to a great
        variety of movements comparable to that executed by a figure
        skater on ice. Thus one can negotiate figure eights and free
        forms as well as elliptic and other geometric forms including
        straight lines at various angles in space and in all possible
        planes. </p>
      <p>The person using the exerciser has great freedom to execute
        movements that will involve many different groups of muscles in
        a single movement pattern. For example, maintaining constant
        pressure while executing a 21/2 foot diameter circle at a
        45.degree. inclination to the body, with one circle formed every
        two seconds, brings into play various muscle groups involving
        the agonist and antagonist groups of forearm, upper-arm,
        shoulder and torso, these groups are involved with different
        phases of the circular motion. </p>
      <p>To execute a smooth movement while maintaining constant
        pressure entails considerable alertness and muscular control.
        Similarly, a figure eight or a circle executed horizontally with
        arms held above the head so that the exerciser is above the
        head, brings into operation various groups of muscles during the
        execution of this figure. </p>
      <p>In using the exerciser, pressure and tension may be alternated
        for the same movement pattern, thereby stimulating both sets of
        muscle groups and preventing fatigue of either. Thus typically
        one might execute five circles in a six second period in a given
        plane in compression, followed by the same number of circles in
        the same plane in tension. The same two sequences are then
        repeated in the opposite sense of rotation. The movement pattern
        might also be ABB'A', where A and A' refer to pressure in
        opposite direction of rotation and B and B' are tension in
        opposite direction of rotation, respectively. </p>
      <p>The ability to execute these choreographic patterns and
        sequences lends a ceremonial touch thereto that creates a
        feeling of symmetry and balance that one might associate with
        such practices as tea ceremonies or such disciplines as Tai Chi.
        A sequence of movements allows the user creative freedom while
        at the same time providing him with healthful exercise,
        development of skill and control. It also provides an exercise
        in orientation in space, developing the kinesthetic sense,
        invaluable for the control and development of dancers. </p>
      <p>Referring now to FIG. 4, a preferred embodiment of the audible
        signal-generating system is shown in block diagram. It will be
        seen that the output of transducer 13 is applied through a
        reversing switch 18 to the input of a free-running multivibrator
        19, the switch being mechanically-responsive to a pulling or
        pushing force so as to apply to the multivibrator an electrical
        value that is always of the same sign. The free running
        multivibrator produces pulses at a repetition rate that depends
        on the magnitude of the applied transducer input so that as the
        input rises, the repetition rate increases accordingly. As
        pointed out previously, by using a two-element transducer having
        a positive-going output regardless of the direction of the
        applied force, one may dispense with switch 18. </p>
      <p>The output pulses of multivibrator 19 is applied to a set of
        four normally-quiescent oscillators 20A, 20B, 20C, and 20D, each
        having a different frequency and amplitude within the audio
        range, the pulses triggering whichever oscillator is rendered
        operative by a multi-level discriminator 21. Thus, by way of
        example, oscillator 20A generates a 200 Hz tone at one amplitude
        level, oscillator 20B generates a 300 Hz tone at a somewhat
        higher amplitude level, oscillator 20C generates a 500 Hz tone
        at a still higher level and oscillator 20D generates an 800 Hz
        tone at the highest amplitude level. It is to be understood that
        in practice the exerciser may include a fewer number of tone or
        pitch changes, or a greater number thereof. </p>
      <p>The oscillators in the set are assigned different force bands.
        If, therefore, the range of forces applicable to the exerciser
        is divided into four bands: low (L), medium (M), high (H), and
        very high (VH), then by means of multi-level discriminator 21,
        which has a different threshold for each of the bands, the
        discriminator 21 acts through suitable gates, to render the
        appropriate oscillator operative. </p>
      <p>The operative oscillator is then triggered on by the
        multivibrator output so that when the low-force band oscillator
        20A is operative, it produces tone pulses or beeps of 200 Hz at
        a repetition rate which depends on the magnitude of the applied
        force. As the force rises to the level of the next band,
        oscillator 20B is rendered operative to produce 300 Hz beeps,
        and so on, as illustrated in FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>In this way the player, by the tone he hears, knows whether the
        force he is applying is of a strength falling into the low,
        medium, high or very high band, and by the repetition rate of
        the pulses he is advised whether the force he is applying within
        a given band is steady, increasing or diminishing. </p>
      <p>Free-running multi-vibrator 19 is under the bias control of
        multi-level discriminator 21 so that the repetition rate of its
        output pulses varies from the same minimum to the same maximum
        value in each of the force bands, L, M, H and VH. For example, a
        useful repetition rate range for this purpose is 1 to 15 pulses
        per second (pps), the 1 pps rate representing the minimum force
        exerted by the user at any force band, whereas the 15 pps rate
        represents the maximum force. </p>
      <p>A user is responsive to the rhythmic beeps produced in this 1
        to 15 pps range, for if the objective in a given exercise is to
        apply and maintain a force of 3 beeps per second in the middle
        force band H, by the distinct tonal pitch of the beep, the user
        knows whether he is in the proper force band, and by the
        distinct rhythm of the beeps he also knows whether he is
        applying the required force in said band. Thus discriminator 21
        functions to apply a bias to multivibrator 19 appropriate to the
        operative force band, so that in response to the analog input
        representing the applied force, the multi-vibrator output
        repetition rate assumes a sawtooth pattern. </p>
      <p>In practice, instead of having each beep tone at a fixed
        predetermined amplitude, the oscillators may be made responsive
        to the pulse repetition rate so that the greater the rate, the
        louder the tone. In this way, as the user increases the force
        applied to the exerciser, the tone of the beeps steps up in
        pitch, the loudness of the tone generated by the operative
        oscillator increases, and the repetition rate also increases. </p>
      <p>For purposes of scoring in competitive play, the output of the
        oscillators may be transmitted by a miniature radio transmitter
        22 incorporated within the structure to an external receiving
        station 23 having a digital counter adapted to count the
        received signal. Counting the signals within a fixed time
        interval, which depends on whatever period is chosen for a
        specified movement pattern, measures the time interval of force.
        Alternatively, such transmission may be carried out by a wire
        connection or by means of a microphone which picks up the
        audible beeps. </p>
      <p>The counting system is arranged to count the number of tone
        cycles received within a predetermined period, not the number of
        beeps. If, for example, the time duration of each beep is 1/10th
        of a second and the tone frequency in the low force band L is
        say 100 Hz, then 10 cycles of tone will be contained in each
        beep. And if the counting system is set to time a 10-second
        interval and the beep rate is 2 per second, then in the
        10-second interval, the total count will be 200. </p>
      <p>In order to have the count increase proportionally as one steps
        from one force band to the next higher band, even though the
        pulse repetition rate range is the same in all bands, the
        duration of the pulses produced in the higher band must be
        increased, taking into account that in the higher band the tone
        has a higher pitch and therefore provides more cycles per
        second. Thus the biasing system for the multivibrator is made
        such that while the pulse repetition rate range for each force
        band is the same, the pulse duration is stepped up as one goes
        from one force band to the next. </p>
      <p>The timer associated with the counter must indicate to the
        user, by way of lights or other signals, the beginning and end
        of the timing interval. Where the exercise being performed
        involves a series of steps or manoeuvres, the timer can be
        programmed to provide signals at the beginning and end of each
        manoeuvre, with an appropriate dead space between manoeuvres to
        allow the user to shift position from one manoeuvre to the next,
        so that counting only takes place during the manoeuvre periods
        to provide a fair score. </p>
      <p>The object of such scoring is not to determine which performer
        or player has attained the highest score (although it can also
        be so used) but to determine who has come closest to the ideal
        score, in the fashion of a bullseye. Thus for each type of
        movement repeated a given number of times, there is an ideal
        score, and for the total sequence of movements there is an ideal
        aggregate score. The fact that the exerciser can be used for
        sport activity is but one of its many attractive aspects. The
        production of rhythmic sounds which accompany the user's
        exertions is, per se, a source of pleasure and amusement. </p>
      <p>While there has been shown and described a preferred embodiment
        of a sound-producing isometric exerciser in accordance with the
        invention, it will be appreciated that many changes and
        modifications may be made therein without, however, departing
        from the essential spirit thereof. Thus, while the structure has
        been described as composed of a pair of bodies, joined together
        by a link, it will be appreciated that these elements can be
        integrated into a unitary structure rather than composed of
        distinct components. Also the timbre of the tones may be made
        different in compression (i.e., -- hollow tones) from tension
        (nasal tones). </p>
      <p>Furthermore the exerciser may incorporate setting means to
        calibrate the system to produce a given number of beeps at a
        standard pressure. A particular advantage of the device is that
        it permits exercise or play within a confined area, while still
        involving muscular effort, skill, scorability and
        competitiveness. It may therefore by used by invalids in
        hospitals as well as in schools and old-age homes. </p>
      <p>In practice, the ends of the exerciser may be provided with
        handles in strap or other suitable form to facilitate the
        engagement therewith, by the feet of the user or by one foot and
        one hand rather than by both hands. The free moving exerciser is
        particularly useful in rehabilitation centers. Because of its
        scorability, it lends itself to graduated exercises as
        prescribed by an attending therapist. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, the exerciser may be in the form of a
        fluid-filled body having a football-like shape or other
        configuration which facilitates grasping thereof by the hands of
        a user, with a transducer so suspended within the body as to
        effectively float therein whereby a force applied to the ends of
        the body acts pneumatically or hydraulically on the transducer
        and gives rise to an output which is translated into an audible
        signal that may be registered or scored in the manner previously
        described. </p>
