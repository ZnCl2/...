      The present invention relates to electric energy generation
      equipment comprising a basic circuit formed by a rectifier (10),
      for example, an AC/DC converter connected in series to an inverter
      (12), for example, a DC/AC converter, and a bank of batteries (13)
      connected in series between the rectifier (10) and the inverter
      (12). An electron capturing element (14), which can be either a
      free space electron capturing element or, alternatively, an earth
      electron capturing element, is connected in series to the basic
      circuit formed by the rectifier (10), the inverter (12) and the
      battery assembly (13). The bank of batteries (13) powers the basic
      circuit because it is connected to the system. Consequently, the
      inverter (12) converts direct current into alternating current and
      supplies this current to the electron capturing element (14).
      After receiving the electric current from the inverter (12), the
      electron capturing element (14) starts capturing electrons from
      the alternating current and powering the rectifier (10), which
      converts the alternating current into a direct current in order to
      recharge the bank of batteries (13) and power the inverter (12)
      which powers the electron capturing element, closing the feedback
      loop, and also providing electric energy for consumption by
      external loads.<br>

      </b><b> Detailed Description of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      There are different ways of closing the self-feeding cycle
      depending on the structure of the electrical circuit. Such
      constructive arrangements are shown in Figures 2 to 6, where the
      main structure of the circuit, which is an open and closed circuit
      generating electricity instantly is maintained.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 1, the self-powered system for generating
      electricity comprises a basic circuit consisting of a rectifier
      (AC DC converter) 10 which is connected in series with an inverter
      (inverter DC / AC) 12 3 a battery bank that is connected in series
      between the rectifier 10 and the inverter 12. A sensor of 14
      electrons - which could be a sensor of electrons of the free space
      (defined in application Brazilian Patent No. BR1020120008378
      equipment, 13.01.2012) or, alternatively, a sensor of electrons
      from the earth (equipment set out in patent No Brazilian
      BR1020120008386 of 13.01.2012) - is connected in series to the
      basic circuit formed by the rectifier 10, the inverter 12 and
      battery pack 13.<br>
      <br>
      Be connected to the system, the battery bank 13 provides power to
      the basic circuit. Consequently, the inverter 12 converts direct
      current into alternating current and provides such current to the
      sensor of electrons 1. The captor of electrons 14, after receiving
      electrical current from the inverter 12, passes to capture
      electrons into alternating current and feed the rectifier 10 which
      converts alternating current to direct current to recharge the
      battery bank 13 and feed the inverter 12, which will keep feeding
      the captor of electrons, ending the cycle of self-feeding, and
      also providing electricity for consumption of external loads.<br>
      <br>
      This particular mode, the rectifier 10 and the inverter 12, which
      initially received electrical current from the battery bank 13,
      started to use the current generated by electron sensor itself.
      Thus, the power supply from the battery bank 13 is switched to the
      power supply from the captor of 14 electrons, ie, the sensor of 14
      passes electrons to provide power feeding the system itself, and
      providing, in output port 18, electricity consumption for external
      loads.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in Figure 2 , another embodiment of the
      self-powered system for generating electricity comprises a device
      that includes a basic circuit of a typical system power supply
      uninterrupted power , known as UPS consists of a battery charger (
      AC DC converter ) 21 connected to a drive device (inverter DC / AC
      ) 23 and connected to them , accumulators energy devices ( battery
      bank ) 22 - with this basic circuit plus other devices and
      connected to a sensor of electrons from space 27 free (defined in
      Brazilian patent application No. BR1020120008378 equipment,
      13.01.2012 ) or, alternatively, a sensor of electrons from the
      ground 27 ( as defined in Australian patent application No.
      BR1020120008386 equipment, 13.01.2012 ) , comprising thus, the
      battery charger ( AC DC converter ) 21 is connected in series to
      the battery bank 22 connected in series with the inverter 23 ,
      which is connected in series with the key phase transfer at the
      connection point 24.1 , which is connected at the connection point
      24.1 the point 24.3 the binding key itself phase transfer 24 ,
      connected in series to the sensor of electrons 27 electrons , in
      parallel with the battery charger (inverter AC / DC) 21 , and this
      is in parallel to surge suppressor 25 to disarm the connection
      points 24.1 and 24.3 of the phase transfer switch 24 and connect
      the connecting points 24.3 and 24.2 , and the connection point
      24.2 is connected in series with the filter 26, which is in series
      with the surge suppressor 25 , which is in parallel to the battery
      charger (inverter AC / DC) 21 , the battery bank 22 , the inverter
      23 and the point of attachment 24.1 , which are in series with the
      transfer switch phase 24 , which is in series with the connection
      point 24.3 and the sensor of electrons 27 electrons , which is in
      series with the phase output 28 .<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative constructive manner, for use in emergency
      situations, in which the system ceases to be self-powered, the
      system may comprise a power input of an external source of
      electricity at the point of interconnection 29 to power surge
      suppressor 25, which provides power to feed exit point 28, to feed
      external loads.<br>
      <br>
      The battery bank 22 releases energy to the inverter 23 and
      inverter 23 converts the DC current into alternating current,
      which shall feed the transfer switch 24. The transfer switch (24)
      is connected to the filter 26 and the captor of electrons 27.<br>
      <br>
      After being fed, the sensor 27 is electron capture electrons into
      alternating current and feed the battery charger (inverter AC /
      DC) 21, the filter 26 which is connected to the surge suppressor
      25 which is connected to the transfer switch 24, which feeds the
      sensor 27, which feeds the battery charger (AC DC converter) 21,
      which is feeding the batteries and switching occurs by the
      transfer switch 24 when the surge suppressor 25 is powered disarms
      the transfer switch 24 cutting off the supply of power from the
      batteries to the inlet of the electric current sensor of 27
      electrons.<br>
      <br>
      When the electron sensor 27 is turned off, the transfer switch 24
      back to baseline (24.1 and 24.3 point connected to the system to
      function as self-feeding.<br>
      <br>
      The electron sensor 27 provides power to the transfer switch 24
      without interruption of power because the transfer switch 24 has
      been switched by the surge suppressor 25 that provides power to
      feed the system itself, ie, closing the cycle of self-feeding and
      providing energy to the point of exit 28, which feeds the external
      loads.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 3 , another embodiment of the self-powered
      system for generating electricity comprises a device that includes
      a basic circuit of a typical system power supply uninterrupted
      power , known as UPS , consisting of a battery charger ( AC / DC
      converter ) 31 connected to a drive device (inverter DC / AC ) 35
      , and connected to them power devices accumulator ( battery bank )
      32 , and this basic circuit together with other devices and
      connected to an electron sensor space 37 free ( equipment as
      defined in Brazilian patent application No. BR1020120008378 of
      13.01.2012, or , alternatively, a sensor of electrons from the
      ground 37 ( as defined in Australian patent application No.
      BR1020120008386 equipment, 13.01.2012 ) comprising , as a bank of
      batteries 32 connected in series with the DC / DC converter 33 ,
      which is connected in series with the switch 34 in the phase
      transfer connection point 34.1 which is connected in series to the
      connection point of 34.3 , which is in series with the inverter 35
      , which is connected in series with the sensor of 37 electrons ,
      and 38 three-phase output , which is in parallel with the battery
      charger (inverter AC / DC) 31 , the rectifier 36 is in parallel to
      the battery charger ( AC / DC) converter 31 , and in series with
      the phase transfer switch 34, 34.2 at the connection point , which
      is in series with the connection point of 34.3 , and in parallel
      with the connection point 34.1 ; switching point 34.3 is in series
      with the DC / AC inverter 35 , which is connected in series with
      the sensor of 37 electrons , which is in parallel to the battery
      charger (inverter AC / DC) 31 , the battery bank 32 , the standby
      inverter DC / CC 33 and the point of attachment to 34.1.<br>
      <br>
      n an alternative constructive manner, for use in emergency
      situations, in which the system ceases to be self-powered, the
      system may comprise a power input of an external source of
      electricity at the point of interconnection 39, connected to the
      rectifier 36, which provide electrical power to three-phase
      transfer switch 34, the inverter DC / AC 35, which is supplying
      electricity at exit 38, which is also the power point of the
      external load.<br>
      <br>
      The battery bank provides power to 32 DC / DC converter 33, to
      feed the transfer switch 34.<br>
      <br>
      At this time, the transfer switch 34 does not switch, because it
      receives direct current of 34.1 and 34.2 points and simultaneously
      transfers the electrical current to the point that feeds the 34.3
      DC / AC inverter 35, which when fed, transforms the dc to
      alternating, and provides alternating current to the sensor of 37
      electrons.<br>
      <br>
      The rectifier 36 provides the transfer switch 34 and the power
      transfer switch 34 receives power from the batteries and the
      inverter 33 which feeds the DC / AC inverter 35. At this time, the
      DC / AC inverter 35 goes to feed the sensor of 37 electrons,
      leaving the supply of energy from the batteries to the power
      supply by the captor, who shall provide power feeding the system
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      Thus , the sensor 37 starts to capture electrons in alternating
      current and starts to feed the battery charger (inverter AC / DC)
      31 . The battery charger (inverter AC / DC) 31 continues to supply
      power to the drive ( 33 ) , continuing the flow of energy<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in Figure 4 , another embodiment of the
      self-powered system for generating electricity equipment that
      comprises a basic circuit of a typical system power uninterrupted
      power , known as UPS , consisting of a battery charger ( AC / DC
      converter ) (A ) connected to a drive device (inverter DC / AC )
      42 and attached to them , devices accumulator of energy ( battery
      bank ) 41 , and this basic circuit together with other devices and
      connected to an electron captor of free space 44 (defined in
      Brazilian patent application No. BR1020120008378 equipment,
      13.01.2012 ) or, alternatively, a sensor of electrons land 44
      (defined in the application equipment Brazilian patent No.
      BR1020120008386 of 13.01.2012 ) thus, a battery charger comprising
      (A) connected to a battery bank 41, which is connected in series
      with inverter 42 at point (B) which is in series with the point (
      C ) of the inverter 42, which is in series with the electron
      sensor 44, which is in series with the phase transfer switch 43
      through the connection point of the three-phase load output 45 ,
      the phase transfer switch 43 is in series with the inverter 42,
      which is connected in series to (AC / DC converter) at (A ) the
      battery bank 41 .<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative constructive manner , for use in emergency
      situations , in which the system ceases to be self-powered , the
      system may comprise a power input of an external source of
      electricity at the point of interconnection 46 , and providing
      power at the output 45, which is also the feed point of the
      external loads.<br>
      <br>
      The battery bank 41 provides power to the inverter 42 which
      converts the direct current into alternating current and feeds the
      sensor of 44 electrons .<br>
      <br>
      The transfer switch closes when the batteries need recharging .<br>
      <br>
      The sensor 44 captures electrons with alternating current , which
      feeds the transfer switch 43 in one of his points of departure
      load receiving alternating current , which becomes the input power
      . The transfer switch 43 feeds the inverter 42 and inverter 42
      supplies the batteries , charging them and closing the cycle of
      self-feeding and providing energy at exit 45 , which is in series
      with the power input , which is also the power point external
      loads. <br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in Figure 5 , another embodiment of the
      self-powered system for generating electricity comprises a device
      that includes a basic circuit of a typical system power
      uninterrupted power , known as UPS , consisting of a battery
      charger ( AC drive / CC ) 51 connected to a drive device (inverter
      DC / AC ) 53 and attached to them , devices accumulator of energy

      parallel to the battery charger 51, ??52 batteries, and the
      inverter 53 and the point (C) of the transformer 55.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an electromagnetic equipment for
      power generation and alternatively for thermal power generation .
      More specifically a device capable of producing electrical energy
      and abundant thermal energy from a tiny power consumption.<br>
      <br>
      When the magnet is removed from the loop , the induced current in
      the loop has a counter to the direction shown in Figure 1 , thus
      generating a magnetic field whose south pole is facing the north
      pole of the magnet. The two poles attract each other , i.e., the
      field generated by the induced current opposes the movement away
      from the magnet. This behavior , in this current generators and
      energy known as engine braking , it is highly undesirable to raise
      the resistance and thereby increase the energy loss.<br>
      <br>
      When two electromagnetic coils are placed facing each other, as in
      figure 2 , there is no power in any of them. At the moment when a
      power switch of one of the closed coil If, in the corresponding
      coil current surge , causing an induced current in the second coil
      . When you close the switch , the corresponding coil current goes
      from zero to a certain maximum value , thereafter remains constant
      .<br>
      <br>
      Thus , when the current is changing , the magnetic field generated
      by it , whose north pole facing the second coil is also changing
      and so is the magnetic flux of this field through the second coil.
      Then comes a current induced in the second coil whose sense is
      such that the magnetic field it generates tends to decrease the
      flow mentioned, i.e., it has a north pole confronting north pole
      of the first field coil.<br>
      <br>
      When the power switch is open , the current in the first coil will
      given its maximum value to zero , the corresponding field
      decreases . The flux of this magnetic field in the second coil
      also decreases , so that the induced current now has an opposite
      direction. This direction is such that the field which generates
      induced current is added to that , that is , has a south pole
      faced the north pole of that field.<br>
      <br>
      Thus , there is a realization of the principle of conservation of
      energy, expressed in Lenz's Law , in which any induced current has
      an effect that opposes the cause that produced it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Assuming that the induced current acts to favor the change of the
      magnetic flux that produced the magnetic field of the coil would
      have a south pole confronting north pole of the magnet approaches,
      causing the magnet to be attracted towards the coil.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If the magnet was then released, would suffer an acceleration
      toward the coil , increasing the intensity of the induced current
      to thereby generate a growing field. This field , in turn ,
      attract the magnet with<br>
      increasing force, and so on, with a continuing increase in kinetic
      energy of the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      If it was drawn power magnet - coil system at the same rate at
      which the kinetic energy of the magnet increases , there would be
      an endless supply of energy. So it would be a motor - perpetual,
      which would violate the principle of conservation of energy.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore , we can conclude that current generators feature a
      large energy loss in electricity generation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Objects of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention aims to contribute to the generation of
      sustainable energy , proposing an electromagnetic machine capable
      of producing abundant electricity from a negligible power
      consumption .<br>
      <br>
      The goal above and other objectives are achieved by the present
      invention by a device comprising at least one electromagnetic
      field generator device - without a nucleus or with at least one
      core - powered<br>
      by a power source - without a core or at least one core - having
      their centers or their extension , preferably their coils or sets
      of coils , wrapped by at least one common conductive member in a
      closed circuit in itself polarized voltage is connected to the
      induction least one conductive interconnection element , which is
      connected to a grounding grid , causing these interconnections ,
      as new technical effect , the appearance of an electric current
      that keeps circling the conductive element in self-enclosed
      circuit for powering&nbsp; external loads.<br>
      <br>
      The device object of the present invention operates as follows :
      the electromagnetic field generating device to be powered by a
      power source , produces an electromagnetic field that induces an
      electric current in the conductor element in self-enclosed circuit
      , creating an interaction one between the magnetic poles of the
      equipment and the magnetic poles of the earth , turning into a -
      through electromagnetic attraction and repulsion - an endless
      supply of electrons from the earth to the conductive element in
      self-enclosed circuit, which is connected to a ground grid through
      the conductive interconnection element.<br>
      <br>
      Attracted electrons are added to the current circulating in this
      closed loop conductive element itself, where electricity is
      available for powering loads of high power, although the device
      object of the present invention is supplied with a small power.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, advantageously, the device object of the present invention
      discloses a sensor of electrons from the earth to generate
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the present electromagnetic equipment to generate
      electricity or thermal energy generation provides access to this
      new source of energy through a magnetic field .<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the interconnections of the components of the
      electron captor object of the present invention cause, as new
      technical effect, the appearance of an electric current that keeps
      circling with or without voltage on conductor element in a closed
      circuit in itself , even without a load consumer connected to it,
      while the sensor is connected.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the proposed sensor can also be used for thermal
      power generation, depending on the way you intend to use the
      effect of the flow of electrical current produced in this
      electromagnetic equipment .<br>
      <br>
      For the generation of thermal energy proportional to the power of
      the sensor values through the movement of electrons in the
      conductive element in self-enclosed circuit, the resistance should
      be increased by increasing the amount of turns that the conductive
      element in a closed circuit in itself gives around the cores, or
      any extension of them, preferably the coils or sets of coils of
      the electromagnetic field generating device, and is made of a
      thermal insulation protection of circuit components, according to
      the temperature to be reached . The thermal energy generated by
      the sensor can be used in any application, from domestic to
      industrial.<br>
      <br>
      This technology can also be used in various technical applications
      in electrical machines. By "electric machines", one should
      understand static electrical machines, transformers, reactors,
      rotating electrical machines, synchronous machines , dual power
      machines , synchronous rectifiers current cascade external pole
      machines , synchronous machines flow , current machines
      alternating or continuous current machines , electronic equipment
      and electrical resistances . The captors of electrons can be
      single-phase , two-phase or three-phase type , in low, medium or
      high voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The uptake by induction does not impact the environment . The fact
      of using , as a force for uptake , only electricity , resulting in
      a negligible consumption in relation to the current generated and
      captured<br>
      by the sensor . The relationship between consumption and
      generation of electricity in the captor is at least 1 per 100, ie
      , for each 1Watt consumption of the sensor , obtains at least 100
      Watts for powering external loads . The relationship , however, is
      not limited , it depends on the mounting position of the sensor
      and its objectives , the generation may be greater than 100 times
      the consumption .<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage of the captor of electrons land proposed in the
      present invention is that the sensor can transport electrons from
      point " A" to "B " point without voltage drop in the conductor
      element in a closed circuit in itself - if it is polarized voltage
      regardless of the distance between the points depending on the
      quantity and power of the electromagnetic field generating devices
      in the same phase . It is also possible to transport electrons
      when the conductive element in a closed circuit itself is not
      polarized . Thus , the electric current is carried without strain
      , only through the magnetic field formed between the device (s) (
      s ) generator (s ) of magnetic field .<br>
      <br>
      In addition , because the electric current is around 7 by
      induction, independent of the voltage at the (s) link ( s) / coil
      (s) driver (s ) 4 of the sensor proposed by the present invention
      , it can be used as a current stabilizer at medium or high voltage
      single-phase , two-phase or three-phase power grids, low .<br>
      <br>
      Although the present invention has been described with reference
      to preferred embodiment and practical applications thereof will be
      apparent to those skilled in the art that a variety of types,
      shapes , models , gender , modifications and changes can be made
      or used without departing from the scope of the invention which is
      intended to be defined by the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      It will be understood that each of the elements described above ,
      or two or more together may also find a useful application in
      other types of equipment and effects that differ from the type
      described above.<br>

      <b>Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The present invention relates to an electromagnetic equipment for
      power generation and alternatively for thermal power generation.
      More specifically a device capable of producing electrical energy
      and abundant thermal energy from a tiny power consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      According to Lenz's law, any induced current has a direction such
      that the magnetic field it generates opposes the change in
      magnetic flux that produced it. Mathematically, the Lenz's law is
      expressed by the negative sign (-) that appears in the formula for
      Faraday's Law, as follows.<br>
      <br>
      The magnitude of the induced electromotive force (E) in a
      conductive loop is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux (F
      ') with time:<br>
      <br>
      d&lt;PB<br>
      <br>
      e =—— - dt Equation 1<br>
      <br>
      As an example of application of Faraday's Law, we can calculate
      the electromotive force induced in a rectangular loop that moves
      in or out at a constant speed, in a region of uniform magnetic
      field. The flow of the magnetic field through the area bounded by
      the loop is given by:<br>
      <br>
      ø = xLB Equation 2<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      and its variation over time is:<br>
      <br>
      At<br>
      <br>
      Equation 3<br>
      <br>
      so<br>
      <br>
      e = vLB Equation 4<br>
      <br>
      e, if the loop has a resistance), the induced current is:<br>
      e vLB<br>
      <br>
      R R Equation 5<br>
      <br>
      A conductor traversed by a current immersed in a magnetic field is
      acted upon by a force given by:<br>
      <br>
      F - IL x B Equation 6<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the effect of the induced current in the loop, come the F *,
      F forces - and FM. The first two cancel each other and the third
      is canceled by an external force FEXT required to maintain the
      loop at constant speed.<br>
      <br>
      As the force F must oppose the force ^ EXT, current (i) induced in
      the loop by the variation of the magnetic flux must have the
      meaning indicated in figure 1. This fact is a particular example
      of Lenz's Law.<br>
      <br>
      Considering the experimental activities discussed with Faraday's
      law, when a magnet is approaching a turn, the induced current in
      the loop has a meaning as shown in Figure 2. This generates a
      magnetic field whose north pole is facing the north pole of the
      magnet. The two poles repel each other, ie, the field generated by
      the induced current opposes the approach movement of the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      When the magnet is removed from the loop, the induced current in
      the loop has a counter to the direction shown in Figure 2, thus
      generating a magnetic field whose south pole is facing the north
      pole of the magnet. The two poles attract each other, ie, the
      field generated munity induced current opposes the movement away
      from the magnet. This behavior, in this current generators and
      energy known as engine braking, it is highly undesirable to raise
      the resistance and thereby increase the energy loss.<br>
      <br>
      When two coils are placed facing each other, there is no power in
      any of them. At the moment when a power switch of one of the coils
      is closed, a corresponding current in the coil arises, generating
      an induced current in the second coil. When you close the switch,
      the corresponding coil current goes from zero to a certain maximum
      value, thereafter remains constant.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when the current is changing, the magnetic field generated
      by it, whose north pole facing the second coil is also changing
      and so is the magnetic flux of this field through the second coil.
      Then comes a current induced in the second coil whose sense is
      such that the magnetic field generates EFA tends to decrease the
      flow mentioned, ie, it has the north pole confronting north pole
      of the first field coil.<br>
      <br>
      When the power switch is open, the current in the first coil will
      given its maximum value to zero, the corresponding field
      decreases. The flux of this magnetic field in the second coil also
      decreases, so that the induced current now has an opposite
      direction. This direction is such that the field which generates
      induced current is added to that, that is, has a south pole faced
      the north pole of that field.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, there is a realization of the principle of conservation of
      energy, expressed in Lenz's Law, in which any induced current has
      an effect that opposes the cause that produced it.<br>
      <br>
      Assuming that the induced current acts to favor the change of the
      magnetic flux that produced the magnetic field of the coil have a
      south pole confronting north pole of the magnet approaches,
      causing the magnet to be attracted towards the coil.<br>
      <br>
      If the magnet was then released, would suffer an acceleration
      toward the coil, increasing the intensity of the induced current
      to thereby generate a growing field. This field, in turn, attract
      the magnet with increasing force, and so on, with a continuing
      increase in kinetic energy of the magnet.<br>
      <br>
      If it was drawn power magnet-coil system at the same rate at which
      the kinetic energy of the magnet increases, there would be an
      endless supply of energy. So it would be a motor-perpetual, which
      would violate the principle of conservation of energy.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, we can conclude that current generators feature a large
      energy loss in electricity generation.<br>

      <b>Objectives of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The present invention aims to contribute to the generation of
      sustainable energy, proposing an electromagnetic device able to
      produce abundant electricity from a negligible power consumption.<br>
      <br>
      The goal above and other objectives are achieved by the present
      invention by a device comprising at least three sets of at least
      one electromagnetic field generator device - without a nucleus or
      at least a core - powered by a power source taking their nuclei or
      any extension of them , preferably their coils or sets of coils ,
      surrounded by at least one conductive element even closed in
      itself , polarized voltage circuit , and these sets of
      electromagnetic field generating devices are arranged with its
      poles in conflict, to promote the interaction of its
      electromagnetic fields , and preferably allocated between two semi
      - hollow metal spheres , in order to concentrate and strengthen
      their electromagnetic fields - that cause these interconnections ,
      as new technical effect , the emergence of an electric current
      that keeps circulating , with or without tension , the conductive
      element in a closed circuit itself - point of connection of
      external loads - even * without having a load of consumption
      linked to it .<br>
      <br>
      The device object of the present invention operates as follows : .
      Sets of electromagnetic field generating devices to be powered by
      a power source , produces an electromagnetic field that induces an
      electric current in the conductor element in self-enclosed circuit
      , creating one interaction between their magnetic poles , going to
      be - through electromagnetic attraction and repulsion - an endless
      supply of electrons to the conductive element in self-enclosed
      circuit. Attracted electrons are added to this current flowing in
      the conductor element in self-enclosed circuit , where electricity
      is available to power external loads of high power , although the
      device object of the present invention is supplied with a small
      power . Thus , advantageously , the device object of the present
      invention discloses a scavenger of free space electrons to
      generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the interconnections of the components of the
      electron captor object of the present invention cause, as new
      technical effect, the appearance of an electric current that keeps
      circling with or without voltage on conductor element in a closed
      circuit in itself, even without a load consumer connected to it,
      while the sensor is connected.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the present electromagnetic equipment to generate
      electricity or thermal energy generation provides access to this
      new source of energy through a magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the proposed sensor can also be used for the
      generation of thermal energy depending on the form is to be used
      to effect of the flow of electrical current produced in this
      electromagnetic equipment.<br>
      <br>
      This field generates an electric current flow, induced by
      electromagnetic coils, which appears in the links interconnecting
      the electromagnetic field generating devices with electromagnets,
      inductors or magnets. This chain operates in favor of the change
      of the magnetic flux produced by the magnetic field in the
      electron captor sense. Thus, it creates a north pole and a south
      pole, providing an endless supply of electric current without
      resistance interconnection links between the electromagnetic field
      generating devices. Thus, it generates electric current induced
      voltage with or without the links interconnecting the
      electromagnetic field generating devices, depending on the
      connection of the electrical circuit in the sensor.<br>
      <br>
      The captor of electrons from space can generate alternating
      current (AC) or direct current (DC). The ratio of energy
      consumption of devices generating electromagnetic field of the
      sensor is<br>
      <br>
      1 x 100, or the generation can be 00 times greater than the
      consumption when they have at least one link / coil driver (s)
      between the coils and the inductors or electromagnets. This
      relationship, however, is not limited, it depends on the mounting
      position of the sensor and its objectives.<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage of the captor of electrons of the free space of
      the present invention is that, with the thermal insulation of the
      components of the electrical circuit, it is possible to produce
      average thermal energy of low or high temperatures, through the
      movement of electrons in the link (s) / turn (s) driver (s)
      between the coils and / or inductors and / or electromagnets. The
      temperature generated is directly related to the amount of turns
      that the link (s) / loop (s) driver (s) gives the coils.<br>
      <br>
      The generation of thermal energy carried by the transducer can be
      used for boiling and evaporation of the liquids to be used in
      other types of power generation, replacing the use of coal and
      natural gas, for example.<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage of the captor of electrons proposed in the
      present invention is that the sensor can transport electrons from
      point " A" to "B " point without voltage drop in the conductor
      link - if it is polarized - regardless of the distance between
      points depending on the amount of power and electromagnetic field
      generating devices . It is also possible to transport electrons
      when the link ( s ) / loop ( s ) driver (s ) of the
      electromagnetic field generating devices is not polarized . Thus ,
      the electric current is carried without tension only by the
      magnetic field formed between the coils . This methodology can be
      used in various fields.<br>
      <br>
      By having a simple constructive manner , the sensor of electrons
      is a simple , compact , low-cost equipment for power generation
      and can be used on all types of machines, equipment and objects of
      all kinds , segments , sectors or areas application requiring
      electrical power for its operation . The captor of electrons can
      be single phase, two phase or three phase and can be used in all
      segments of generating electric current in low, medium or high
      voltage power anywhere .<br>
      <br>
      The present invention will be hereinafter described with the aid
      of drawings, but they are not absolutely limiting, which can be
      seen further details and advantages of the present invention , in
      an example implementation with four coil sets / inductor /
      electromagnets .<br>

      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b>Figure 3 shows a top view of one of the two
      semi-hollow metallic spheres that is one of the scavenger of free
      space electrons proposed in the present invention. This
      half-sphere 1 is made preferably but not limitedly, of aluminum,
      having locking tabs.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 4 shows a bottom view of one of the metal half-spheres 1.
      It is observed are four magnetic field generating devices, in this
      case four coils / inductor 3 arranged around the first hemisphere
      and fixed in a bracket 6 which is secured to the first semi-sphere
      by two locking tabs.<br>
      <br>
      A side view of the sensor of electrons from the free space is
      shown in Figure 5. We can observe the two metal half-spheres 1
      (forming an imperfect sphere and three coils fixed on three
      securing tabs and two inductors connected to three conductive
      elements 4 via a closed circuit itself, in this case bond (s) /
      loop (s) driver (s) 5. 6 gives support to support the entire
      sensor and its components.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 6 and 7, respectively, show views of the upper and lower
      metal half-sphere 1, which accommodates four coils 3 fixed on the
      holder 6 (not shown) which is secured to the first semi-sphere by
      two locking tabs. It is still observed in Figure 6, the inductors
      4 - or electromagnets interconnected to the respective coils 3
      through link (s) / coil (s) driver (s) 5. Each coil 3 forms a
      conjunction with their respective inductive 4. In Figures 6 and 7
      are observed in four of these sets A, B, C and D.<br>
      <br>
      Involving the turns of the coil 3 , there is at least one common
      link ( s ) / loop ( s ) driver (s ) 5 - may have other shapes -
      making at least one turn around the turns of the coil 3 ,
      preferably two turns if the goal is to generate electric power ,
      and preferably four laps if the goal is the generation of thermal
      energy. Both this winding, as the number of laps around the turns
      of the coil 3 are directly related to the amount of current to be
      generated in ( s ) link ( s ) / loop ( s ) driver (s ) 5 . The
      link ( s) / coil (s) driver (s ) 5 may be formed by one or more
      conductor elements cross section dimensioned according to the
      desired power .<br>
      <br>
      In clusters A, B , C and D , the coils 3 present their twisted
      loops for at least the same link ( s ) / loop ( s ) driver (s ) 5
      , which should occur at least once around the loops of 3 reels .
      This winding is connected to the respective electromagnets 4 of
      each set A, B, C or D according to figures 6 and 7. It is
      noteworthy that inducers or electromagnets 4 can be any type of
      inductor, or even use other types of coils .<br>
      <br>
      Figure 8 shows the connection of the coils of the link
      interconnecting conductors 5 in either set A, B , C and D formed
      by the inductor coil 3 and 4 . As shown in Figures 6 and 7 , the
      link (s) / coil (s) driver (s) 5 is closed between the coils 3 and
      4 the respective inductors . So we have that to 5.1 in figure 8
      must be connected together , as well as 5.2 points . Thus, the
      interconnection links 5 are sealed between the coils 3 and
      respective electromagnets 4 and inducers . Still observed the
      power conductors 7.1 , 7.2 , 7.1 where points should be connected
      to each other , as well as 7.2 points . To the coils 3 and 4 are
      respective inductors fed , feeding must be one of the power
      conductors 7.1, 7.2 with the stage while the other conductor 7.1,
      7.2 should be fed neutral .<br>
      <br>
      In the sensor of free space electrons proposed in the present
      invention , the coils 3 may be of any monophasic, biphasic or
      triphasic power . Furthermore, the coils 3 may be powered by any
      voltage value (V). <br>
      <br>
      The power coil 3 can be provided from any source of electrical
      supply to the electromagnetic potential as a power grid . And the
      captor of electrons can be built with configuration for direct
      current or alternating current setup . Thus, if the power source
      is alternating electrical current - CA , the sensor provides
      alternating electrical current - CA . If the energy source is a
      continuous electrical current - DC , the sensor provides
      continuous electrical current - DC . The captor of electrons from
      the earth can be single phase, two phase or three phase , low,
      medium or high voltage.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 9 shows a circuit diagram representation of the sensor with
      four sets A , B, C and D inductor coils 3 and 4 . Note the
      induction 9 around the nucleus of 3 sets of coils A, B , C and D.
      The effect of the interaction of electromagnetic fields 11 is
      shown . With the induction 9 , the flow of electrical current in
      10 link ( s ) / loop ( s ) driver (s ) 5 occurs , attracting the
      free electrons through the electromagnetic field of the sensor .
      Then , the electrons join with the current generated by induction
      on link ( s ) / loop ( s ) driver (s ) 5 , circulating among the
      north-south magnetic poles , north and south .<br>
      <br>
      By way of example, the coils 3 are formed by a single-phase core
      type column system with windings and insulating loop around the
      core, but the genus coils and any shape may also be used. The
      electron sensor proposed by the present invention can be
      constructed with another type of electromagnetic field generating
      device, as at least one electromagnetic coil or magnet or
      electromagnetic inductor of any kind and form, with any
      combination of them, and in unlimited quantities at each stage of
      electron captor.<br>
      <br>
      The uptake occurs via an electromagnetic field that is formed by
      the closure of 3 reels with electromagnets or inducers 4 through
      link (s) / loop (s) driver (s) 5 among the eight elements.<br>
      <br>
      This produces the closing movement of electrons from the coil
      assembly 3 (A) ( for simplicity , referred to as a coil 3a ,
      attracted by proton coil assembly 3 (D) 3 -D coil , and electrons
      are repelled by the electromagnetic field the actual 3 - D coil.
      Such electrons of 3 - D coil protons are attracted by the coil 3b,
      and electrons are repelled by the coil itself (3b ) . Such
      electrons coil 3b are attracted by the protons coil 3 - C , and
      electrons are repelled by the electromagnetic field of the coil
      itself 3c. Similarly , electrons coil 3 - C protons are attracted
      by the coil 3a , and electrons are repelled by the electromagnetic
      field of the coil itself 3a. Such electrons coil 3a are attracted
      by the protons of the 3 - D coil , and electrons are repelled by
      the magnetic field of its own 3 -D coil. Similarly , the electrons
      in the 3 - D coil are attracted by proton coil 3b, and electrons
      are repelled by the electromagnetic field of the coil itself 3b.<br>
      <br>
      These electrons coil 3b are attracted by the protons coil 3c, and
      electrons are repelled by the armature coil own 3-C, and then the
      electrons of the coil C-3 protons are attracted by the coil 3a,
      and electrons are repelled by the magnetic field of the coil
      itself 3a, which extends cycle while the coil sets a, B, C and D
      are being fed by a voltage. These endless attractions and
      repulsions generate an electric current in the link / coil driver
      5.<br>
      <br>
      In the sensor, the voltage is stable. Regardless of the amount of
      current generated - which can be very high - the voltage will be
      the same in the sensor circuit, because the current moves through
      the attraction and repulsion of the electrons, regardless of
      voltage.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 10 shows a representation of the electric circuit diagram
      of the connection between the coils 4 and inducers 3 , clusters A,
      B , C and D. It is noted that the sets A , B, C and D are enclosed
      between the coils 3 and respective electromagnets 4 and inducers .
      The power conductors 7.1 , 7.2 , 7.1 where points of sets A , B ,
      C and D must be connected between ' itself , as well as 7.2 points
      . To the coils 3 and 4 are respective inductors fed , feeding must
      be one of the power conductors 7.1, 7.2 with the stage while the
      other conductor 7.1, 7.2 should be fed neutral .<br>
      <br>
      Sets A, B , C and D after being fed generate voltage electrical
      current through the attraction and repulsion of electrons in the
      link / coil conductor 5 , where there is at least one load output
      8.1 , which should be connected joining the sets A and C, and at
      least one output load 8.2 , which should be connected joining the
      sets B and D. The output points 8.1 , 8.2 are the respective
      phases and neutral of power points 7.1 , 7.2 .<br>
      <br>
      Thus, it constitutes one of the electron sensor phase space in
      which the phase and neutral are formed each by two pairs of sets
      of coils / inductors 3 and 4.<br>
      <br>
      The coil assembly 3/4 the electromagnet can be replaced by a set
      coil 3/3 spool without damage to the sensor.<br>
      <br>
      The sets A, B, C and D are inserted in a metal semi-hollow sphere
      1 formed preferably - but not limited extent - aluminum. The
      semi-sphere 1, whose function is to focus and enhance their
      electromagnetic fields, simulating an electron cloud is fixed to
      the ground by a support 6 and has 2 mounting tabs, which are fixed
      coils 3.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 11 shows the electromagnetic diagram of the north and south
      poles of the coils 3 and 4 inducers of sets A, B, C and D of the
      captor. The electromagnetic behavior described for Figure 9 is
      again demonstrated by the formation of the set of magnet with the
      north pole and south pole being attracted and repelled by the
      lines of force of the magnet starting from point "A" to "D" dot
      dot "A "to point" B ", the" B "point to point" C "point" C "to
      point" A ", and so on, while the electromagnetic field there.<br>
      <br>
      The captor of free space provides the electrons, so that the
      electric current induced by the electromagnetic field circulate in
      favor of change of the magnetic flux that produced sense. Thus,
      the magnetic field creates a north pole and a south pole at each
      of the sets A, B, C and D, as shown in Figure 11.<br>
      <br>
      By feeding the coils 3 of the sensor with a desired voltage, a
      magnetic field is generated in the coils 3, between the four sets
      A, B, C and D form a flow of electrons. This flow in order to
      offset electrical current - ordered motion of electrons - that
      flows in link (s) / loop (s) driver (s) 5 closed captor, thus
      generating the capture of electrons from the free space.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic field of the coil 3-A circulates in the
      direction north-south, the electromagnetic field of the coil 3-B
      circulates in the north-south direction, the electromagnetic field
      of the coil 3-C circulates in the direction north-south, and the
      electromagnetic field of the coil 3-D circulates in the direction
      north-south, as the figure 11. We emphasize that up SETS A, B, C
      and D can be formed by any major combination between coil, magnet
      and electromagnet.<br>
      <br>
      What coil induces 3-A is the electromagnetic field north-south,
      which induces the coil 3-B, is the north-south field. The field
      that induces a 3-coil C is the field north-south. And the field
      that induces the coil 3-D is the north-south field. Assim, um is
      created electromagnetic field induced in the coils of conjunto and
      can have any major power, single phase, three phase or biphasic.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 12 shows the electrons being attracted and repelled from
      the coil inductors 3 and 4. Being repelled and attracted by
      electromagnetic induction, the current movement is elétrica sem
      resistance.<br>
      <br>
      The detector produces electromagnetic waves that Can I be used for
      various purposes, including those of transmission of any major
      signal frequencies for any major purpose.<br>
      <br>
      The uptake is stemmed through these electromagnetic waves. You can
      get the same physical effect of uptake with the combination of
      other technologies, including electromechanical, electromagnetic,
      electro-electronic or by combining magnetized magnet or any other
      type material equipment.<br>
      <br>
      The captor of electrons of the free space of the present invention
      is also a renewable source for the production of electrical
      current and a new way of generating energy through the capture
      effect, generating flows of electrons, generating ordered motion
      of electrons - electric current - as shown in Figures 9, 11 and
      12. Electrons can move without tension in the link (s) / loop (s)
      driver (s) 5 and may alternatively be biased at any voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The structure type of electric circuit - open and closed - makes
      possible the generation of electric current through the
      electromagnetic link (s) / loop (s) driver (s) 5 - where the
      current is generated and moves with or without strain. Thus, the
      present invention provides a new concept of power generation, as

      <b>Technical Field</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a system for generating
      electrical energy comprising an electric generator coupled to a
      power-controlled by a frequency inverter through a shaft that
      includes at least one or conforms concentric solid motor
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The conventional generators and alternators need at least a
      combustion engine coupled to its operation in rotation and torque
      to generate electricity. By way of example, the document
      PI9102642-3 describes a synchronous generator with autoexcitED
      injected engine copper or aluminum. Such generators are used
      coupled to a internal combustion engine having means which allow
      the generator to operate in the most appropriate range of rotation
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, the known generators to generate electricity at a
      desired frequency generally behave at a set rotation, ie 1800 rpm
      60 Hz, 1500 rpm 50 Hz These conventional generators and
      alternators have a high energy consumption at the time of
      departure and consumption energy considerably high.<br>
      <br>
      Generators are facilities for the production of electricity, are
      alternative energy sources, and come in different shapes and
      types. The different types of generators include, for example,
      electric generators, portable wind generators, emergency
      generators and RV generators. Each type has a specific function
      and can be fed, for example, propane gas, gasoline, diesel and
      natural gas. All these forms of energy are used as initial force
      to fuel generators, contributing to global warming and attacking
      the environment.<br>
      <br>
      A fully electric generator does not pollute. However, when using
      an electric motor, the motor power is above the power generator.
      Thus, the energy consumption to generate energy through alternator
      electric generator electric motor is greater than the power to be
      generated, because to produce the traction force would be
      necessary for the engine to consume more power than the generator
      generates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The present invention is a system for generating electrical energy
      comprising a three phase frequency inverter, a three-phase
      electric motor, alternator and a generator includes a shaft that
      conforms or at least a concentric solid structure arranged between
      the electric motor and generator. Such elements, appropriately
      arranged, allow the set to operate in rotation and proper
      operation of the electric motor, which drives the generator to
      power consumption savings for generation without considerable loss
      of power generated and output current traction force.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Objectives of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      In view of the problems described, and in order to overcome them,
      we propose a system to generate electricity that is powered by
      electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The cost of power generation is less than the cost of generating
      combustion, can generate benefits for medium and large consumers,
      reducing operating cost through energy savings.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, when it generates a large amount of electricity from the
      power consumption low, is contributing with the environment and
      reduces the cost of generation.<br>
      <br>
      The cost of generation is reduced due to the replacement of the
      combustion engine with an electric motor. Thus, the energy
      consumption to be provided by the initial source that feeds the
      engine is electricity.<br>
      <br>
      The objectives of the present invention are achieved through a
      system of generating electricity using a shaft that includes
      conform or at least a concentric structure with proper solid mass,
      which, when turning, due to the transfer of inertia of its mass in
      displacement rotation, generates kinetic energy by means of a
      centrifugal force, increasing the engine speed. Thus, the motor is
      replaced by the tensile force required to drive the generator
      shaft connected to a load.<br>
      <br>
      The system for generating electrical energy comprises a frequency
      converter connected to an electric motor to control engine speed,
      and a generator alternator connected to the electric motor via a
      shaft that includes at least one or conforms concentric solid
      structure arranged between the altemador generator and electric
      motor, with the mass of the shaft that includes at least one or
      conforms concentric solid structure proportional to power the
      electric motor.<br>
      <br>
      Proper rotation is defined as a generator voltage and frequency.
      To obtain the proper rotation frequency of an inverter is
      necessary for the low speed or high speed for the proper rotation
      of the generator motor.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the engine power can be up to four times smaller than the
      electric power generator. Thus, although the engine being below
      the generator, the consumption of electric energy consumed by the
      engine to generate drops considerably, ie, is consumed very little
      power and generates a lot of electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the voltage and number of phases of the motor and the
      generator may be identical or different.<br>
      <br>
      The power generation system of the present invention allows the
      use of an electric motor coupled by a shaft that includes either
      at least one concentric conforms solid structure to an electric
      generator alternator. The electric generator starts to generate
      electricity with low power consumption, since consumption of the
      motor becomes smaller, consuming less energy from the initial
      source to rotate the generator shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of the electric motor generator alternator of the
      present invention in comparison to other existing alternators
      generators is the generation of electricity with low power
      consumption to perform work rotation of three-phase generator.<br>
      <br>
      The system of power generation is easy to use, as it features a
      compact structure. The mounting base is light, since the motor is
      lightweight and does not use any type of liquid or gaseous fuel
      tank<br>
      <br>
      The system for generation of electricity is silent because the
      electric motor and generator are, and also because the axis that
      includes at least one or conforms concentric solid structure does
      not produce noise, since it does not suffer intense friction.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention will be described below, using drawings, but
      they are not absolutely limiting, which can be seen further
      details and advantages of the present invention..<br>
      <br>
      <b>Brief Description of the Drawings</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Figure 1 - A schematic representation of the power
        generation system of the present invention.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Detailed Description of the Drawings</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b>Figure 1 shows a system for generating electrical
      energy comprising a three-phase frequency inverter 1 connected to
      a three phase electric motor high speed (2) and a three-phase
      alternator generator 8.<br>
      <br>
      The system further comprises a shaft conforms or 4.1 that includes
      at least one concentric solid structure 7 arranged between the
      engine 2 and the generator 8 to generate a force necessary to
      reduce the power consumption while maintaining, totally or
      partially, the traction force of the traction electrical
      alternators generators provided by the electric motor.<br>
      <br>
      The concentric solid structure 7 can have a variety of shapes,
      such as square, rectangular, hexagonal, round, spherical, oval,
      and star and others.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the shaft conforms or comprising at
      least a concentric solid structure 7 as well as the very solid
      structure concentric 7 are constructed of resilient metal, the
      latter of which has a rounded shape of a wheel.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in Figure 1, the system further comprises a metal
      shaft 4.1 connecting the generator motor 2 to 8 couplings 3.1 and
      3.2 which are used to secure the second motor shaft 7 to the wheel
      axis and the wheel axis 7 axis of the generator 8 and a base for
      supporting and fixing the equipment (9).<br>
      <br>
      the concentric structure 7 must be seven to nine times the mass of
      the shaft 4.1, more preferably eight times, even more preferably
      nine times. Thus, each horsepower - CV of the electric motor 2,
      the sum of the masses of the concentric axis 4.1 and solid
      structure 7 must be between 5 Kg and 15 Kg per unit horsepower
      electric motor (2) more preferably between 8 kg to 12 kg and most
      preferably 10 kg<br>
      <br>
      Thus, for a motor 5 CV 2, the sum of the masses of concentric
      solid structure 7 and the metal shaft must be 4.1 to about 50
      pounds. Whereas the mass of the metal shaft 4.1 is about 1 kg per
      CV, the mass of the solid structure 7 is concentric about 9 kg per
      CV.<br>
      <br>
      The three-phase generator altemador 8 provides energy savings to
      be consumed in work to generate electricity and can be configured
      with the power of 10 KVA to 300 KVA single-phase, two-phase or
      three-phase type, and may be above or below these powers.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the system uses an electric motor 2
      high-spin to work at low rpm. The inverter controls the rotation
      of the motor 2 rotation and to achieve the ideal frequency of the
      system which are determined in compliance rotation and frequency
      of generator 8, which can be 50 Hz or 60 Hz depending on the
      desired tension. Only when the system reaches the optimum tension
      is that energy is released for consumption by an electrical
      control connected at the output of the generator 8, that is, the
      command only releases energy when the generator 8 reach the
      rotation, frequency and voltage suitable for power loads, avoiding
      under-and overvoltage.<br>
      <br>
      In fixing the shaft bearing 4.1 is used and bearing 6.1 and 6.2
      5.1 and 5.2. Axis 4.1 weighs about 1 kg per hp / HP in relation to
      engine power, so there is a transfer of appropriate inertia.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the metal wheel 7 weighs about 9 kg per
      hp / HP in relation to power the electric motor so there is the
      transfer of appropriate inertia.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred embodiment, the electric motor can be direct
      current or alternating current and is controlled by frequency
      inverter 1, which reduces power consumption when the motor starts
      and controls the rotation of the generation (may be substituted
      for any other similar equipment with the power of 10 KVA to 300
      KVA, single phase, two phase or three phase).<br>
      <br>
      In a second preferred embodiment, the generator (8) has a power of
      10 KVA to 300 KVA.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of preferred embodiments having been described, it should
      be understood that the scope of the invention covers other
      possible variations, being limited solely by the terms of the
      appended claims, including therein the possible equivalents.<br>

      The present invention relates to an electromagnetic device for
      generating electricity. More specifically a device capable of
      producing electricity using the return current consumption, and
      propagate the electrical current in the air.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      There are countless designs of mechanisms for the generation of
      electricity based on electromagnetism, but the projects have
      hitherto known technical limitations concerning generating
      capacity and ecological implications that prevent use in economic
      scale.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Objectives of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Compaction equipment of electric current , comprising a device
      that includes a shaft concentrically incorporates a metallic disc
      , preferably an aluminum disk , and also fixed to the shaft near
      the disk at least one magnetic field generator device is proposed
      ( magnet) or electromagnetic, with the end of the shaft , but not
      attached to it , at least one other device for generating magnetic
      field ( magnet) or electromagnetic, fixed to a base, getting close
      to the magnetic field generating device ( magnet) or fixed axis ,
      arranged with their poles in confrontation with that , and
      adjacent to the axis electromagnetic willing , being part of the
      aluminum disc between them , at least two devices generating
      electromagnetic fields - which are connected to the power source
      and loads external - and at least one inductor , both arranged
      near the magnetic field generating devices ( magnets) or
      electromagnetic aligned to the axis , so that their magnetic and
      electromagnetic fields is to interact with the movement of the
      shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The device object of the present invention operates as follows for
      the compression of electric current: the electromagnetic field
      generating devices are powered by an external power source such as
      a dealership. Thus, the shaft is rotated through electromagnetic
      induction and electric current drawn by the load inductor.<br>
      <br>
      The inductor receives the return current, provokes confrontation
      and interaction of electromagnetic fields generated by devices
      generating electromagnetic fields with magnetic fields of the
      magnet, whereupon rotation of the metal disc occurs, turning the
      shaft and magnet fixed to it along with its magnetic field. Thus,
      there is generation of tension and compression of the electrical
      current return to feed a new load again.<br>
      <br>
      It is further proposed a device for the propagation of electric
      current in the air, which device comprises a device that includes
      a driving force to rotate a shaft concentrically incorporates a
      metallic disc , preferably an aluminum disk , and also fixed to
      the shaft near the disk device generating at least one
      electromagnetic magnetic field (magnet ), or having the end of the
      shaft but not attached to it at least one other magnetic field
      generating device ( magnet) or electromagnetic, fixed to a base,
      getting near the generator device fixed to the shaft , arranged
      with their poles in confrontation with that , electromagnetic
      magnetic field ( magnet) or and disposed adjacent to the axis ,
      being part of the aluminum disc between them , at least two
      devices generating electromagnetic fields - which are connected to
      the power supply and the external loads - at least one of them an
      inductor , both arranged near the magnetic field generating
      devices ( magnets) or electromagnetic aligned to the axis , so
      that their magnetic and electromagnetic fields to interact if ,
      with the axis movement.<br>
      <br>
      The device object of the present invention operates as follows for
      the propagation of electrical current in the air: a driving force
      rotates the shaft, rotating metal disc and along with it the
      magnet that is attached to the axis, comparing with the magnetic
      field of the magnet that is attached to the base. Thus, the
      magnetic fields of the magnets interact with the electromagnetic
      field of the external load. With this interaction of fields in
      rotation, the inductor starts to generate voltage that will
      provide the potential difference (ddp) when closing the circuit
      with the neutral or earth, neutral or earth that feeds the
      external load may be used. Thus, the electric current through the
      interaction of magnetic and electromagnetic fields propagating in
      the air.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides an apparatus for generating
      electrical voltage which generates energy by reusing the current
      drawn from consumer sources. Thus, the equipment does not harm the
      environment when used as force generating electricity itself,
      having a negligible consumption in relation to the current
      generated.<br>
      <br>
      The generation of voltage equipment is compact and inexpensive and
      can be used in various types of machinery, equipment or
      application areas that require electricity for operation.<br>

      Figure 1 shows an apparatus for generating electrical energy
      capable of compressing electrical current and propagate electrical
      current in the air. The equipment comprises a driving force, in
      this example, an electric motor 1 fixed to a central shaft 4 by a

      devices, in this case, magnets 9.1, 9.2 to the central axis 4 and
      a coupling metal engages the motor shaft 1 to the drive shaft 4.<br>
      <br>
      The center shaft 4 is connected to a metal fixing plug fixing the
      disk 5 and an upper 6 and a lower support bracket 8 which are used
      to attach the magnets 9.1, 9.2.<br>

      A pin 2.2 centralizes at least two magnetic field generating
      devices, in this case, magnets 9.1, 9.2 to the central axis 4 and
      a coupling metal engages the motor shaft 1 to the drive shaft 4.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus further comprises electromagnetic field generation
      means, in this case an inductor 12 coupled to a support holder 10
      and another electromagnetic field generating device, in this case
      a coil 14. The support bracket 10 is connected to the coil 14 via
      a bracket-type iron "U" 13 which centralizes the disk space 6
      between the inductor 12 and the coil 14.<br>
      <br>
      Although coils are shown, magnets and inductors in the present
      exemplary embodiment, other types of electromagnetic field
      generating devices, such as at least one electromagnetic coil or
      magnet or electromagnetic inductor of any kind and form, with any
      combination of them can be used , and suitable for every
      application equipment quantities.<br>
      <br>
      The inductor 12 receives current from a power source 17, which may
      be any electrical circuit or electrical machine that generates or
      consumes electricity in performing work.<br>
      <br>
      The coil 14 and the inductor 12 comprises at least one core of any
      geometric shape. The core may be, for example, silicon iron. The
      core is formed by more than a number of members, which together
      form one or more core windows.<br>
      <br>
      The coil 14 may have a rounded, square shape with no columns or
      columns. The coil 14 rounded form must be fully insulated with
      insulating material as its phase: single phase, two phase or three
      phase.<br>
      <br>
      By way of example, the coil 14 with central square columns, the
      columns should be insulated with insulating material as its
      phases: single phase, two phase or three phase. Have the coil 1
      square without column, the coil must be fully insulated with
      insulating material as its phases: single phase, two phase or
      three phase.<br>
      <br>
      One form of primary coil winding 14 is made with enameled copper
      wire members and cross section is defined according to the iron
      used and the desired coil voltage 14.<br>
      <br>
      The power generator can be from 1 KVA to 1000 MVA and may be lower
      or higher than this, with the single phase, two phase or three
      phase type.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the coil comprises a core 14 formed of
      laminated oriented silicon iron sheets. The core is formed by a
      number of members which together form one or more core windows.<br>
      <br>
      The inductor 12 also provides any shape such as round, square and
      with or without columns.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, as can be seen in figure 2, the
      inductor 12 comprises two columns with iron tablets, one over the
      other forming a format type "U". Columns are completely isolated
      and a conductive member 30 is wrapped around the columns
      concentrically, involving the columns of the inductor 12.<br>
      <br>
      The conductive member 30 is closed shorted ends, forming an
      artificial load. The number of turns and cross-section are
      calculated and sized according to the power of the inductor (12).<br>
      <br>
      Upon closing of the artificial load, the member (30) must be
      insulated to not have contact points 21 and 22. A second
      conductive member is wound concentrically in the columns of the
      inductor 12 and the sizing and number of turns are calculated as
      the electrical current reception desk where the term corresponding
      to paragraphs 21 and 22 of the ends of the conductor member 30
      receiving current loads external.<br>

      The captors of electrons from the earth and the captors of
      electrons from space perform the function of capturing power
      generation. The captors of electrons in free space are described
      in Australian patent application No. BR1020120008378 of
      13.01.2012. The transducer refers to an electromagnetic device for
      generating electrical current through the capture of free
      electrons. The electron earth sensors are described in Australian
      patent application No. BR1020120008386 of 13.01.2012, which
      relates to a device for generating electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Compression of current consumed:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The term "consumed electric current" refers to the return current
      of the power from any power source 17 to produce work, consumption
      factor.<br>
      <br>
      For the compression of electric current, the inductor coil 12 and
      14 are powered by an external power source such as the
      concessionaire. Thus, do not use the electric bike 1 to rotate the
      shaft 4, the shaft 4 is rotated by electromagnetic induction and
      the electric current drawn by the load inductor 12.<br>
      <br>
      To generate tension and compact electric current, with voltage
      feeding the coils inductors 14 and 12 of this equipment is only
      the generation of tension and compression of the electrical
      current return by moving the shaft that can be of any equipment
      that generates or consumes electrical current, which will
      transform the current return in power to be reused.<br>
      <br>
      It should be switched point (A) of the coil 14 to point 21 of
      inductor 12 which is connected to the stage, and the point (B) of
      the coil 14 is connected to the neutral and may also be powered by
      the neutral of the power source to be compacted 17.<br>
      <br>
      The inductor 12 to receive electrical current from the power
      source to be compressed by paragraph 21 (which is the phase of the
      inductor 12 which is connected to the point (1A) of the coil 14
      generates a return of the compressed stream that will come out in
      the form of power point 22 of the inductor 12 can connect any
      external load 17 at point 22 which is the output stage of the
      inductor 12 to the neutral point (B) of the coil for consumption
      according to its compressed output through the physical effect and
      the current flow 7. connection with this form of electrical
      current is compressed.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in Figure 3, the generation of the electromagnetic
      field has the opposite effect 7. The saw is compact as the
      rotation axis 4, which rotates through electromagnetic induction
      generated by the current. The stream is compressed in the form of
      power to be used again, regardless of the voltage and frequency of
      rotation of the shaft 4 is transferred because the voltage and
      frequency of supply to the coil 14 and the inductor 12 to the
      current that was compressed into power for reuse again working.<br>
      <br>
      By feeding coil circuit 14 and the inductor 12, an electromagnetic
      field is generated, where the phase must be connected in point 21
      of inductor 12 which is connected to the point A of the coil 14,
      the load neutral is connected to point B the coil 14, the load 17
      to be compressed must be connected at point 22 and the inductor
      coil to point B 14.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the load 17 is turned on and the return current of the load
      17 arises, and said chain will return to the starting point is
      point 22 which supply output.<br>
      <br>
      The inductor 12, to receive the return current in paragraph 22,
      the physical effect happens 7 that will confront the
      electromagnetic field generated by the inductor 14 and the coil
      12, and the magnetic field of the magnet 9.1 and 9.2. Through
      interaction of electromagnetic and magnetic fields, rotation of
      the disc 6, which turns the shaft 4 and the magnet 9.1 along with
      its magnetic field occurs. Thus, the feed stream is compressed to
      a new load 17 again.<br>
      <br>
      The power source 17 may be any machine that consumes or generates
      electric current, ie, is a device that consumes energy for its
      operation, causing return electrical current to be compressed, or
      any machine that generates electrical current through the capture
      and movement of electrons, providing electrical current to be
      compacted.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the device recycles the current consumption of a device or
      machine, transforming the current power consumption to be reused
      without having to return to the external consumer supply point, or
      the initial source.<br>
      <br>
      The higher the speed, the greater the compression chain and the
      greater the compaction of the current, the greater the power.<br>
      <br>
      It is noteworthy that the electromagnetic field generating devices
      12 and 14 are powered by a power source, as the circuit shown in
      Figure 4, to generate tension and compression of electrical
      current.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Propagation of current in the air:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The equipment can also be used for the propagation of the air
      stream. For the spread of current in the air, the inductor 12 and
      the coil 14 are not supplied with power from an external source,
      only the electric motor 1 is fed to move the axis 4, which by
      rotation, creates tension in paragraphs 21 and 22 of inductor 12,
      and at the same time, the electric current propagates in air.<br>
      <br>
      The device operates at a constant rotation speed synchronized with
      low or high speed, generating frequency and alternating electrical
      voltage applied to an inductor 12 terminals due to equal rotation
      between the rotating field of the magnet 9.1 with the field of
      electric current backfire 7 shown in figure 3 and the magnetic
      field produced by the magnets which are fixed to 9.2 0 base.<br>
      <br>
      The propagation of the air current is directly proportional to the
      rotation axis, the greater the rotation, the higher the voltage
      generation inductor 12 and the current spreading in the air.<br>
      <br>
      The manner of connection to the voltage generation and propagation
      of the air stream through the shaft 4 by rotating the disk 6 by
      any mechanism synchronized to a constant rotational speed, with
      low or high rotation frequency, and generates an alternating
      voltage applied to the terminals points 21 and 22 of inducer 12,
      wherein the entry point 21 and 22 becomes external current output
      terminals of this shape for powering loads.<br>
      <br>
      Point 21 and point 22 of the inductor 12 will leave the generated
      voltage and frequency according to the rotation, ie, due to the
      equal rotation between the rotating field and the magnetic field
      produced by the magnets 9.1 and 9.2, and the coil 14 and the
      inductor 12 are not fed and are close to the magnets 9.1 and 9.2.
      Thus, the voltage is generated in the inductor 12 in points 21 and
      22, where the exit phase. The neutral is connected to ground, and
      when the neutral phase generation will leave the closing of three
      coils 14 star.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnetic field of magnets 9.1 and 9.2, as the rotation
      shaft 4 with the electromagnetic field produced between the
      magnets 9. and 9.2 and the inductor 12, expands the electric
      current through the electromagnetic field of magnets 9.1 and 9.2,
      where 9.1 is the magnet rotating with the shaft 4 and the 6 disc
      by rotating electromagnetic field generated. As the phase is
      lagged 360p degrees from one another, with the rotation of the
      electromagnetic field at 360 °, the phases cancel each other, and
      the chain expands in the free space in the air.<br>
      <br>
      The engine or any other mechanism which can rotate the shaft 4 at
      a constant rotation, rotates the magnet 9.1 which is connected to
      the shaft 4 with the magnetic field of the magnet 9 1 that is
      confronting the magnetic field of the magnet 9.2, which is fixed
      to the base 10<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the magnetic fields of the magnets 9.1 and 9.2 interact with
      the electromagnetic field of the load 17 which may be the sensor
      of electrons. With this interaction of rotating field, the
      inductor 12 is generating voltage in paragraphs 21 and 22 that
      will provide the potential difference (ddp) when closing the
      circuit with the neutral or earth, you can use the neutral or
      earth that feeds external load.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the electric current through the interaction of magnetic and
      electromagnetic fields propagating in the air.<br>
      <br>
      The equipment can be used with any type of electric motor:
      Single-phase, two-phase or three-phase AC or DC voltage or any
      combustion engine, or any other type of mechanism that can rotate
      the generator shaft which operates on a constant speed synchronous
      rotation with low or high rotation rate and generating alternating
      electric voltage applied to the terminals of the inductor 12 due
      to the equal rotational movement between the rotating field and
      the magnetic field produced by the magnets 9.1, 9.2.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that the electromagnetic field generating devices 12
      and 14 are feed points of cargo, electric circuit as shown in
      Figure 5 for voltage generation and propagation of electric
      current in the air.<br>

      overunity.com forum comment -- A thousand amps now! Or is it zero
      amps like the meter showed just before the camera panned away in a
      hurry? At least his heavy wires look a bit more plausible for
      heavy current, but a thousand amps for any length of time would
      vaporize that heavy cable just as surely as it would a smaller
      one.<br>
      <br>
      Don't believe me? Then take that heavy cable and hook it directly
      across the poles of a fully charged car battery. You'll see what a
      kiloamp of Real Current can do. But please wear safety glasses and
      stand well back.<br>
      <br>
      Let's say the resistance of that two feet of heavy cable is 0.001
      ohm. It is probably much higher than that but let's use one
      millOhm. The power dissipated in that cable, then, is I2R, or
      (1000 x 1000) x 0.001, or One KiloWatt. It would be glowing
      red-hot in moments. If the resistance of the cable/connectors is
      only 0.01 ohm, one hundredth of an ohm.... you then have TEN
      KILOWATTS of dissipation in your cable.<br>
      <br>
      And I think a very good and impressive demonstration of real power
      would have been for him NOT to have switched it off, and let it
      start glowing from the heat.<br>
      <br>
      I've deliberately blown components to illustrate my points in
      videos.... and you can bet I would have supported a claim of a
      thousand amps with something other than an unstable meter reading
      from an unknown uncalibrated instrument. But that's just me,
      nobody pays attention to me, because I don't make claims I can't
      support with real data.<br>
      <br>
      Here's a challenge: Put a 30 amp fuse in series with that cable
      and repeat the experiment. Or if you are really confident, use a
      100 A fuse. <br>

      add another inductor to give this current flow suddenly boom!
