      ... Several years ago, a local HS science teacher with a Ph.D.,
      was introduced to me and I was told that he had a device that
      would sit on top of the roof of a home, and produce energy free
      for 25 years. That went in one ear and out the other, then he
      produced a letter from the head of the physics department of a
      highly regarded engineering school validating the statement. I
      phone the professor and made it a point to visit him personally.
      He validated the statement by saying that the lab prototype did
      indeed prove itself. <br>

      A thermoelectric battery is disclosed which uses pipes connected
      in series made from two different metallic materials. The pipes
      are connected in an alternating manner and exposed to sunlight to
      increase the temperature therein. Other parts of the pipes are
      connected to a cooler temperature such as water or the ground to
      produce a temperature differential suitable to produce a voltage
      potential. The thermoelectric battery is also used to supply power
      to a swinging pendulum in which two different ionic chemicals are
      mixed at a selected time to generate electrical power. The
      thermoelectric battery, connected through a pacemaker circuit,
      produces a magnetic field at predetermined periods equal to a
      multiple of the period of oscillation of the pendulum, the field
      acting to give the pendulum a push in order to keep the pendulum
      from stopping.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention.</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a thermoelectric battery which
      produces an electrical charge from sunlight, and a power system
      which produces an electric current or potential from stored
      chemical energy in which the thermoelectric battery provides
      energy to make up for losses therein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The thermoelectric battery of the present invention makes use of
      dissimilar metals or metal alloys connected in series in an
      alternating manner to produce an electrical current when the
      dissimilar metals or metal alloys are exposed to a high
      temperature such as that produced by direct sunlight. The
      dissimilar metals or metal alloys of the battery can be flat
      plates made of copper and aluminum and separated by a nickel
      plate, or can be a series of copper and iron pipes connected in an
      alternating series. The thermoelectric battery is partially
      submerged in a water tank or in the ground to maintain the ends of
      the plates or pipes in a lower temperature than the plate or pipe
      section exposed to the sunlight. Adjacent pipe sections are
      connected together by a wire to maintain the series linkage.<br>
      <br>
      The power system of the present invention uses a thermoelectric
      battery to provide make-up power to overcome frictional losses in
      the power system. The power system includes a pendulum device
      having a sphere filled with an ionic chemical mixture separated by
      a vegetable membrane. The ionic compound can be vinegar and water,
      a mixture of 20% sodium and 20% calcium and 60% chlorine, or other
      well known ionic compounds. Movement of the pendulum causes an
      agitation of the ionic mixture, which then produces electrical
      power to charge an external capacitor. The thermoelectric battery
      is used to supply electrical current to a pacemaker circuit, which
      then supplies pulses of electrical power to a magnetic field
      generating device which produces a "kick" to maintain the pendulum
      in a swinging manner. At the top of the pendulum is located a
      permanent magnet. Adjacent to the permanent magnetic is a bar
      magnet surrounded by a wire coil connected to the pacemaker
      circuit. When the pacemaker circuit produces a pulse of electrical
      current, the coil produces a magnetic field in the bar magnet, and
      the resulting magnetic field is used to push and/or pull (the
      "kick") on the permanent magnetic attached to the pendulum to add
      energy to the swinging pendulum.<br>

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The power system of the present invention is shown in FIG. 1. A
      thermoelectric battery 10 is partially submerged in a body of
      water 15. The thermoelectric battery includes a copper plate 12
      and an aluminum plate 14 separated by an electrically conductive
      plate 13 made of nickel. The nickel plate 13 binds the two outer
      plates 12 and 14 together. The nickel plate could be made of other
      materials that have high electrical conductivity. Electrical
      conducting wires 17 and 18 are connected the respective plates 12
      and 14 to a pacemaker circuit 20. The thermoelectric battery 10
      can be partially submerged halfway in fresh water or salt water,
      or can be partially submerged underground halfway. The size of the
      plates of the thermoelectric battery 10 would depend on the amount
      of electric power needed for the pacemaker circuit 20 and the
      pendulum 30.<br>
      <br>
      The pacemaker circuit 20 includes a 6-volt battery 22, a first
      resistor 21, a switch 25, a capacitor 23, a second resistor 24,
      and a transformer 26. The pacemaker circuit 20 makes use of the
      electrical energy stored in the internal battery 22 and the
      electrical energy supplied by the thermoelectric battery 10 to
      charge the capacitor 23. The internal battery 22 would supply the
      pacemaker circuit with the necessary electrical power to charge
      the capacitor 23 when the thermoelectric battery 10 is producing
      less electrical power than usual such as when a cloud blocks the
      sunlight 16. When a charge on the capacitor reaches a
      predetermined electrical potential, the built-up charge in the
      capacitor 23 is released into the transformer 26 and an electrical
      current is released through wires 43 and 44. The charge in the
      capacitor 23 is released when the switch 25 is moved to the right
      side position in FIG. 1. The switch is a well known self-acting
      switch that moves to the discharge position when a certain
      potential voltage is reached, and returns to the charge position
      when the voltage drops below a certain level. The values for the
      battery, resistors, capacitor and transformer can vary depending
      on the characteristics of the pendulum (which is described below).<br>
      <br>
      The output of the pacemaker circuit 20 is connected by the wires
      43 and 44 to a bar magnet 41. The bar is approximately 1 inch in
      diameter and 12 inches in length. The wires 43 and 44 coil around
      the bar magnet 41 a number of times to form an impulse device 40
      for generating a timed pulse (force) or "kick" that acts on the
      swinging pendulum at specified points in the motion of the
      pendulum in order to keep the pendulum swinging. The number of
      coils 42 would depend upon the amount of magnetic field to be
      generated by the bar magnet. When a current from the pacemaker
      circuit 20 is induced in the wires 43 and 44, a magnetic field is
      generated by the coils 42 and the bar magnet 41. The resulting
      magnetic field generated is used to apply a pushing or pulling
      force on a magnet 50 located near the top of a pendulum 30. The
      direction of the current generated in the wires 43 and 44 would
      determine in which direction the magnetic force generated in the
      coils 42 would act. To produce the correct direction of force, the
      wires 43 and 44 could be reversed in their connection to the
      pacemaker circuit 20, or the magnet 50 on the pendulum 30 could be
      turned so that the other pole faces the bar magnet 41.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical parts of the pacemaker circuit 20 can be chosen
      such that the natural frequency at which the pacemaker circuit
      discharges would be synchronized with the natural frequency of the
      swinging pendulum. Another embodiment would provide a sensor (not
      shown) near the pendulum 30 to determine when the pendulum 30 is
      in a certain position. When the pendulum is in a certain
      position--such as all the way to the right in FIG. 1--a control
      system (not shown) connected to the sensor would allow discharge
      of the pacemaker circuit 20 to provide the electrical current to
      the wires 43 and 44 to produce the "kick" in a timed relation to
      the motion of the pendulum 30.<br>
      <br>
      The pendulum 30 includes a hollow sphere 33 made of an
      electrically conductive material such as aluminum having a
      diameter in this embodiment of about 1 1/2 feet. A pendulum arm 32
      connects the sphere 33 to a fixed pivot point 31. The length of
      the entire pendulum in the preferred embodiment is about 70 feet.
      Inside the hollow sphere 33 is a non-conductive insulator 34
      dividing the hollow sphere into two equal volumes 35 and 36. The
      insulator 34 can be a vegetable membrane. Inside the hollow sphere
      are chemical ionic substances, which function as an
      electrochemical battery to generate an electric current. The
      chemical ionic substances could be a mixture of 5% to 10% water
      and the rest vinegar, or a mixture of 20% sodium, 20% potassium
      and 60% chlorine. The ionic compound is placed in both halves of
      the sphere 32 in equal proportions. Movement of the sphere causes
      the ionic chemicals to agitate. The ionic mixture includes
      compounds of different charges. In the water and vinegar mixture,
      the vinegar includes an OH compound having a negative charge. The
      smallest ion will pass through the membrane 34. This flow of
      charged ions through the membrane 34 would result in a voltage
      potential being established within the hollow sphere. Also located
      in the sphere are two metallic electrodes 37 and 38. One electrode
      37 is made of gold while the other electrode 38 is made of silver.
      Other materials could be aluminum and iron. The electrodes 37 and
      38 carry an electric current developed by the ionic chemicals in
      the sphere 33 through wires 53 and 54 to a capacitor 52. A voltage
      is developed in the capacitor 52, which can be used for electrical
      power.<br>
      <br>
      In order for the timed pulses from the pacemaker circuit 20 to be
      effective in maintaining the swinging motion of the pendulum 30,
      the values of the resistors 21 and 24 and capacitor 23 must be
      related to the length of the pendulum. The frequency of the
      pacemaker circuit must be equal to or proportional to the natural
      frequency of the pendulum. The voltage in the capacitor 23 is Vc
      =.epsilon.(1-e@-t/RC) where .epsilon. is the voltage in the
      battery 22, R is the value of the resistor 21, and C is the value
      of the capacitor 23. The thermoelectric battery 10 is required to
      provide at least 120 volts of electrical power to the pacemaker
      circuit 20. For the pulsed force applied to the pendulum 30 to be
      effective, .tau.c =100*.tau.p or the characteristic time constant
      of the pacemaker circuit 20 should be 100 times the value of the
      period of oscillation of the pendulum. When this occurs, the
      voltage in the capacitor 23 will be 0.63.epsilon. or 75.6 volts.
      Letting the value of the capacitor 23 to be 100 micro-farads, and
      the length of the pendulum is 70 feet (or 21.34 meters), the value
      for the resistor 21 becomes R=9,267,000 ohms. The discharge of the
      pacemaker circuit 20 will occur when the switch 25 is in the left
      side position of FIG. 1, which is after 100 oscillations of the
      pendulum. Since Vc =VMAX *e@-t/rC and I=VMAX /r*e@-t/rC, and if I0
      =10 amps, then r=75.6 volts/10 amps or 7.56 ohms. The resistor 24
      is r=7.56 ohms. Then, the discharge time of the pacemaker circuit
      20 is .tau.=rC=0.000756 seconds or about 1 micro-second.<br>
      <br>
      When the stored chemical energy in the ionic compound is used up,
      the mixture in the sphere 33 is replaced with a new mixture for
      the next operation of the pendulum system.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows another embodiment of the thermoelectric battery 110
      used to convert sunlight into electrical power. The thermoelectric
      battery 110 includes a series of galvanized iron pipes 117 and
      copper pipes 118 arranged in an alternating pattern. The pipes are
      connected together in the middle of a sunlight accumulation tank
      by a metal joiner 114 such as a metal tube. The metal tube could
      be made from the same material in which one of the pipes 117 or
      118 is made from. Two pipes can be connected to the connector 114
      by welds or threads cut into the connector 114 and the pipes 117
      and 118. Outside the accumulation tank 110, the pipes are
      connected together by elbow joints 115. The accumulation has a
      Plexiglas layer 112 for structural support, and an insulation
      layer of Styrofoam 116. Covering the top of the accumulation tank
      is a glass pane or window 113. The window allows the sunlight to
      pass into the interior of the accumulation tank but does not allow
      the ultraviolet energy to escape (the greenhouse effect). The rise
      in temperature inside the accumulation tank heats up the pipes and
      produces the desired electrical voltage and current in the series
      of pipes. The outside ends of the pipes are buried into the ground
      15 or submerged halfway into a body of water to cool the ends of
      the pipes in relation to the pipes inside the accumulation tank.
      The series of pipes are connected together by wires 121 such that
      an alternating series of pipes in formed (as in FIG. 4). The first
      and last pipes in the alternating series would be connected to the
      wires 17 and 18 leading to the pacemaker circuit 20.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows another embodiment of the thermoelectric battery 110
      in which a series of pipes are connected together. The galvanized
      iron pipes 117 and copper pipes 118 arranged in an alternating
      pattern and together inside the accumulation tank by the
      connectors 114. Outside the accumulation tank the pipes are
      connected together in the alternating pattern by wires 121. Also,
      the pipe sections extending on the outside of the accumulation
      tank would be submerged in water or placed in the ground to
      maintain the outside ends of the pipes at a lower temperature to
      that inside the accumulation tank. FIG. 4 shows the alternating
      pipe connection arrangement. The ends of the series of pipes are
      connected to the pacemaker circuit by wires 17 and 18. As shown in
      FIG. 5, increasing the number of pipes produces a linear increase
      in the power supplied by the pipe arrangement.<br>
      <br>
      In order for the thermoelectric battery of the present invention
      to produce the largest amount of power, the pipes inside the
      accumulation tank should be as hot as possible while the ends of
      the pipes outside the acccumulation tank should be as cold as
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the thermoelectric battery and the pendulum system will
      now be described. The two halves 35 and 36 of the hollow sphere 33
      are first filled with the desired ionic chemical compounds. If the
      water and vinegar mixture is desired, a fully mixed solution of
      the vinegar and water are placed in both halves in equal
      proportions. The pendulum 30 is manually positioned at an angle of
      about 30 degrees off center and held by a latch (not shown) or the
      like until ready for release. While the pendulum 30 is in this
      positive potential energy state, the thermoelectric battery 10 is
      collecting sunlight 16 and producing electrical power. The
      electric power is delivered through wires 17 and 18 to the
      pacemaker circuit 20, which charges the capacitor 23 while the
      switch 25 is in the left side or charge position. The electrical
      output of the thermoelectric battery 10 is also used to supply
      power to a user (not shown). Under low load situations, the power
      supplied by the thermoelectric battery 10 would be enough to power
      the user. In the situation where the supplied power is not
      enough--such as in high demands or a loss of sunlight--the
      pendulum can be released to produce the required agitation of the
      ionic chemicals and thus the electrical power therefrom. As the
      pendulum is swinging, the pacemaker circuit--in synchronized
      operation with the pendulum--will provide an electrical current or
      pulse to the wire coils 42 around the bar 41 such that a magnetic
      field is generated. The magnetic field will produce an impulse
      force (the "kick") on the magnet 50 connected to the pendulum arm
      32 and thus add enough energy to the swinging pendulum to make up
      for the normal losses therein to keep the pendulum swinging. The
      power developed in the ionic chemicals in the hollow sphere 33 can
      be used to charge a capacitor 52 or used to supply power to the
      user of the thermoelectric battery 10. When the ionic chemicals
      have been fully used up and no more electrical power is generated
      in the sphere, the used chemicals can be drained and the sphere
      refilled. The pendulum is then positioned at about 30 degrees and
      locked in place awaiting another instance when the potential
      energy of the pendulum is required.<br>
      <br>
      The bar magnet 40 and pacemaker circuit 20 can supply the "kick"
      to the pendulum 30 after 100 cycles of the pendulum 30, or any
      other number of cycles depending on the amount of energy the
      pendulum losses during its swinging motion. The purpose of the
      "kick" is to make up for losses in the movement of the pendulum.
      Also, the timing of the pacemaker circuit 20 can be done through a
      position sensor and capacitor 23 discharge system that will detect
      a predefined number of oscillations of the pendulum and the proper
      position of the pendulum before releasing the "kick".<br>
