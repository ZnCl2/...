      The notion of drawing up electrical power from the ground sounds
      incredibly fanciful to conventional scientists, but numerous
      patents support the claim. A number of retrieved patents list
      compact batteries which can operate small appliances by drawing up
      ground electricity. Others describe methods whereby enough usable
      electrical power may be drawn out of the ground itself for
      industrial use.<br>
      <br>
      Earth batteries have been detailed in a previous article. Their
      history can be traced back to experiments performed by Luigi
      Galvani on copper plates in deep stone water wells. Currents
      derived through these gave Galvani and his assistants "shivering
      thrills and joyous shocks".<br>
      <br>
      The most notable earth battery patent is one which operated arc
      lamps by drawing "a constant electromotive force of commercial
      value" directly from the ground. In addition to this remarkable
      claim, a vocal radio broadcast system... through the ground.<br>
      <br>
      It all began one hundred and fifty years ago with the advent of
      telegraphy. The meandering wire went through rich dark ever-green
      forests. Lush com flowing valleys sparkled and languidly waved as
      the linesmen drew their trail. Across meadows where wild flowers
      covered the earth in fragrant bouquets, there went the line in its
      curious path.<br>
      <br>
      Over rolling hills which soared into the hazy sunlight, the
      telegraph linesmen sang as they went. And the lines followed a
      mysteriously winding trail which few discern. Sorciers and
      Templars alike called these trails "woivres". Anglo-Saxon
      geomancers called it VRIL, the black radiant organismic energy of
      earth.<br>
      <br>
      Who is Nathan B. Stubblefield, and why do most citizens in the
      state of Kentucky justifiably revere his name? A native of Murray,
      Kentucky, Nathan B. Stubblefield had a love for the lonely wooded
      areas on the outskirts of town. Certain spots in these woods were
      mysterious and possessed of a strange magic all their own. Few
      would seek the magic of these places, and learn its true and deep
      power. There the song is sweet and deep, and still.<br>
      <br>
      Vitalizing and sense-provocative, Stubblefield knew that specific
      locations could be unique natural energy sources. Rock outcrops,
      evergreens, and flowing springs each registered as strong sensual
      attractants. Could it be that they were sensual attractants
      because they conducted and projected special energetic ground
      currents? Can it he that we are enthralled and drawn into certain
      spots because of their projective energy? Furthermore, what is the
      exact nature of this energy? Does it contain or exceed the
      qualities of electricity?<br>
      <br>
      A self-educated experimenter and avid reader of every kind of
      scientific literature, Nathan Stubblefield supplemented his living
      with farming. He remained a practical inventor of some of the most
      unusual electrical devices ever developed in America.. What he
      discovered and demonstrated before hundreds of qualified observers
      in his day seems to challenge many basic axioms of electrical
      dynamics.<br>
      <br>
      He developed an extraordinary receiver of ground electricity
      (which produced great quantities of electric power) and numerous
      "vibrating telephones" which were used by local residents in 1887.
      The telephonic devices were patented in 1888 and represent the
      first commercial wireless telephones, using the ground as the
      transmission medium. The years when telephonic lines were suddenly
      made available to the world betrayed the fact that the new medium
      was one which only the very rich could afford. Common people could
      simply not be serviced with local telephones until prices were
      made cheaper.<br>
      <br>
      While telegraphy employed thrifty iron wire, telephony demanded
      the expensive and better conducting copper lines. Telephones
      designed by A. G. Bell did not give powerful enough signals
      through iron wire at any distance because of the additional
      resistance represented. Other problems included the fact that the
      Bell telephone could not transmit or receive a strong and clear
      vocal signal without excessive battery power. The Bell System was
      not a truly "democratic" medium of communications.<br>
      <br>
      A mysterious and unrecorded sequence of discoveries preceded
      Stubblefield's early developments, but he was able to dispense
      with wire connections entirely. His was not a "one-wire" system.
      Nathan Stubblefield performed the "impossible": he developed,
      tested, demonstrated, and established a small, democratic
      telephone service which did not require wire lines at all! His
      system utilized the ground itself as the conductive medium.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Stubblefield discovered that telephonic signals of exceptional
      clarity could be both transmitted and received through the ground
      medium. There was simply no precedent for this development. The
      first effect of this wonder was that common people could now have
      the much needed communications which both great distance and
      poverty prevented. Farms could be interlinked by the Stubblefield
      exchange by simply plugging both terminals into the ground. Wire
      would not take up the expense which the telephone exchange would
      later charge to the customers in addition to service. Signals were
      loud and clear. All those who experienced this kind of telephonic
      conversation declared that Stubblefield had discovered a true
      wonder.<br>
      <br>
      We have photographs of his telephone sets. These reveal small,
      ruggedly built wooden cases which are surmounted by conventional
      transmitter-receiver sets. Heavy insulated cables rim to the outer
      ground from this apparatus. Stubblefield developed an
      "annunciator" (horn loudspeaker) which amplified the voice of
      callers. These sets of his appeared in numerous demonstrations on
      the east coast, from New York to Delaware. The signals were so
      loud and clear that they defied commercial levels of excellence
      provided by the now growing monopolies of American Telephone and
      Western Telegraph.<br>
      <br>
      Thomas Edison broke the Bell telephone monopoly when he developed
      the carbon button microphone for Western Union. Sounds were louder
      when using the Edison carbon microphone. These carbon microphones
      needed excessive battery power, and batteries were not cheap. Some
      telephone companies began utilizing dynamo systems to power their
      lines. The fuel needs of dynamos drive customer costs much too
      far, prohibiting the ordinary people from having the system for
      their own moments of need.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield developed remarkably unexpected systems by which
      available resources became the commodity. In the early
      Stubblefield system, twin terminals into the ground formed the
      initial bridge among telephones. System users were effectively
      joined together through the ground itself: wires were eliminated!
      The signals were exceptional, and did not fade or intensify with
      rain, a fact later to be considered in theoretical discussions.
      Those who experienced speech through the Stubblefield system each
      reported similar impressions.<br>
      <br>
      Ordinary soil conduction telephonics require a certain degree of
      ground water for their operation. Stubblefield's system did not
      operate on this principle for reasons which will become more
      obvious as we continue recounting his tale.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield developed a means by which calls could be
      individualized among customers. Later, his central telephone
      exchange included power-amplifying relays, set in the ground at
      specific distances. Calls were handled by an elaborate system of
      two-wire, ground connected automatic switches and relays. Signal
      purity was remarkable for the time, using a single carbon button
      for both transmission and reception.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, Stubblefield's telephones could be left on for days
      without weakening the power system at all. Now hundreds of
      ordinary people in widely separated places could afford the [12]
      installation of telephone service.<br>
      <br>
      The theoretical reasons why ground conduction telephony can occur
      had later been established by researchers in England, notably Sir
      William Preece. Preece successfully attempted only telegraphic
      signals across great distances of land and sea. Stubblefield was
      telephoning through greater distances with the legendary clarity
      and strength which became equal to his other mysterious
      developments.<br>
      <br>
      The true difference between the Stubblefield system and these
      early "conduction telegraphy" systems becomes obvious as soon as
      we delve further into his biography. How were ground plugged
      relays acting as amplifiers in the Stubblefield system? This
      feature forms the core of an intensive investigation which several
      have reproduced in various forms today.<br>
      <br>
      His discovery of an earth charging phenomenon permitted the
      development of an equally astounding invention, the Stubblefield
      earth battery. This device, an earthed electrode, drew up enough
      natural electric charge from the earth to operate motors, pumps,
      arc lamps, and his ground telephone system. The implementation of
      his earth energy technology would have changed the nature of
      American Society were it permitted free market expression in its
      day.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MEANDERING WAYS</b><br>
      <br>
      As telephony gradually replaced the telegraph service, lines were
      also accommodated to telephony. Before becoming entirely
      reclusive, Mr. Stubblefield befriended a few employees of the
      telephone service. These friends obtained cast-off telephone
      equipment and parts for his experiments.<br>
      <br>
      He became very familiar with the behavior of telephone exchange
      equipment in the natural environment. The telephonic systems of
      existing service companies were grounded systems. Each end of both
      telegraphic and telephonic lines were sunk into the ground, while
      the single expensive copper line formed the communications link.
      Ground sites terminated specific lengths of these service lines in
      special, thick metal plates. Plates were well-buried in selected
      ground. These plates were composed either of zinc or copper, and
      required specific ground placement for their continued operation.<br>
      <br>
      Linesmen were taught to find "good ground" for these sites. Some
      later insensitivity among the growing numbers of hired crew
      members required the development of "ground location meters"; none
      of which were to give the special and anomalous characteristics
      observed in early linework.<br>
      <br>
      Certain telephonic patents reveal extremely articulated"
      termination plates for these service lines: folded, stacked,
      coiled, and interleaved. Acting as accumulators of earth energies,
      these often became extremely charged. It was found that signals
      would both self-clarify and self-amplify to unexpected degrees
      when these special terminations were employed.<br>
      <br>
      Telegraph linesman "felt" their way through woods, laying the
      paths for lines according to a peculiar intuition. Theirs was an
      intuitive path rather than a strictly mathematical one, carved
      through woods and vales in the artistic meandering way of the
      ancient "geomancers". Older linesmen recalled the days when line
      installations took their winding routes through woods, across
      meadows, and sinuously along ridges, lakes, and streams. Linesmen
      innately sensed the most favorable paths along which lines should
      pass.<br>
      <br>
      Geomancy is the ancient qualitative science by which "holy spots"
      are discerned, and sacred edifices are properly founded. Intuitive
      discernment, rather than mathematical objectivity, governs the
      geomancer's aesthetic. Geomantic aesthetics governed the building
      of ancient villages and towns, and it is no wonder that most
      architects of any real artistic worth exercise these same
      aesthetics. Art-governed architects are natural geomancers.<br>
      <br>
      Geomantic qualitative science precedes geologic quantitative
      science. A surveyor might simply draw a straight line across a
      section of land, and engineers would then employ powerful means to
      cut that straight path despite all natural barriers. Much of
      modern housing development is based on this "draw and cut" method.
      The sharp paths of engineers is effective and direct, but the old
      meandering rural roads dotted with their naturally placed homes
      are beautiful.<br>
      <br>
      The old linesmen trekked across woods in a careful manner, turning
      aside from natural barricades. Maps of these first telegraphic
      lines may be consulted. It will be seen that these lines meandered
      with natural features. Telegraphic lines twisted and turned
      through the countryside and wilds; a twisting vine of iron on
      tar-covered wooden poles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ELECTRICAL OCEAN</b><br>
      <br>
      Properly ground-conformed telegraph lines were known to produce
      unexpected signal strengths, as well as unexpected signals. Night
      station operators were often "haunted" by spurious messages. These
      contained fragmentary words and sentences, and could not be traced
      to other station operators.<br>
      <br>
      It is curious that the older placed lines demonstrated a
      remarkable and constant feature throughout their years, requiring
      few, or no batteries for their operation. This absolutely
      astounding fact is well documented in the telegraph and telephone
      literature of the day.<br>
      <br>
      In these trade journals we find reports of lines in which current
      was everflowing! Company owners found this fascinating natural
      fact quite lucrative as well as surprising. The question was,
      where is the current coming from? The echo of the linesman
      resounded in the forest, the answer singing beneath his feet.
      Another equally remarkable fact involved the engineer's
      methodically driven lines across land and through mountains. These
      lines did not manifest electrical self-excitations. Clearly, the
      difference of methods had produced completely opposed energetic
      results; the one active and the other inert.<br>
      <br>
      As companies expanded across greater regions of ground, engineers
      replaced the oldtime lineman's sense of "proper placement" with
      surveyor's charts. It is not unusual for corporate expansions to
      bring about such a dramatic loss of quality — in exchange for a
      growth of quantity.<br>
      <br>
      MrStubblefield pondered the question of "taking current from the
      ground". He stated in very plain language that the earth was
      filled with "an electrical ocean". This electrical ocean was
      surging with huge "electrical waves" which could be felt in
      certain places. No doubt, he was one who felt the ground energy.<br>
      <br>
      Telegraph lines were once two-wire lines: each completing the
      circuit among station receivers, batteries, and keys. It was
      quickly [13] discovered that single lines, terminated in the
      ground with heavy metal plates, could achieve similar results. The
      immense savings in wire, poles, insulators, and maintenance was an
      attractive feature of this method for company owners.<br>
      <br>
      Telegraph linesmen required skill in finding proper ground
      terminals. Improperly placed ground plates could ruin a system by
      not conducting signals properly through time. Spurious
      conductivity in a line could ruin critical transmissions and
      receptions. Telegraphic lore is filled with discussions about both
      "good ground" and "bad ground".<br>
      <br>
      The linesmen were workers in a yet primarily agrarian society,
      having experience with soil and earth in general. Many of them
      were farmboys who watched the oldtimers "divining" for water.
      Linesmen frequently discussed such natural means for discerning
      the "good ground" for terminating a telegraph line.<br>
      <br>
      Thomas Edison adopted a method which could "valve" line signal by
      preventing unnecessary signal leakages into the ground. His method
      included the use of terminal rheostats in order to control the
      amount of current flowing to the ground during signal time.
      Several of these terminal rheostat patents have been found. One
      familiar model uses a thick cylinder of carbon with a slide spring
      contact.<br>
      <br>
      The most amazing thing to the telegraph linesmen was the variation
      of rheostatic settings which each ground required before strong
      signalling could occur. Some terminal rheostats needed to be
      closed completely. Others could be opened full until signals were
      of sufficient strength to operate the system. Each ground had its
      own "character". Each ground was possessed of activities which
      defied description except but by poetry, song, and twisting green
      vine.<br>
      <br>
      Telegraph line was not copper, neither was it insulated throughout
      its length. Telegraph line was bare iron wire, and was supported
      on porcelain insulators fixed to tarred wooden poles. Signal
      strength along such resistive wire would have theoretically been
      extremely poor, but was exceedingly strong at times. So great was
      the developed signal strength that operators could "remove battery
      cups" and work with almost no current at all. Where did this extra
      energy come from? From what mysterious depths did this strange
      power emerge? Examination of telegraph systems reveals them to be
      radionic tuners on a vast scale. I suggest that VRIL articulate
      energy, the dendritic living energy found in the ground, was at
      work in all these systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EARTH RESERVOIR</b><br>
      <br>
      Nathan Stubblefield's experiments involved the development of
      earth batteries: buried metallic arrangements which produced
      electrical power. We find a good number of the earth battery
      designs in the Patent Registry. The earliest designs appeared in
      1841 when Alexander Bain discovered the phenomenon. While working
      a telegraphic line, he chanced to discover that his leads had
      become immersed in water. This short-circuit through earthed water
      did not stop the actions which resounded through his system.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Bain took the next step to a greater distance, burying copper
      plates and zinc plates with a mile of ground between them. These,
      when connected to a telegraphic line performed remarkably well
      without any other battery assistance. Bain obtained a patent for
      his earth battery in 1841, using it to drive telegraph systems and
      clocks.<br>
      <br>
      Stephen Vail (1837) observed the same effect, not knowing what
      caused it. The establishment of the first functional telegraph
      line seemed to require ever few batteries with time. Vail began
      with some 12 battery cups, reducing them gradually until 2 were
      needed. There came a point where he found it possible to remove
      even these, while operating the system.<br>
      <br>
      This mystery persisted for years. I have heard such an account by
      a close friend and electrical engineer who reported that local
      telegraph stations remained in operation despite the fact that
      their batteries had not been recharged for a great number of years
      (W. Lehr).<br>
      <br>
      J. W. Wilkins in England (1845) corroborated findings made by
      Bain, developing a similar earth battery for use in telegraphic
      service. An early English Patent appears in 1864 by John Haworth,
      the first true composite earth battery. This battery is drum
      shaped, having numerous solid discs mounted on an insulative axis,
      end braced, and buried. Their power was rated in terms of disc
      diameter and telegraph line distance: 1 foot diameter discs for 75
      miles of line, 2 foot discs for up to 440 miles of line.<br>
      <br>
      Patent Archives have revealed a great number of these devices
      including several remarkable operative descriptions. Earth
      batteries by Garratt (1868), Edard (1877), Mellon (1889), and
      Hicks (1890) yield therapeutic powers. Earth batteries by Bryan
      (1875), Cerpaux (1876), Bear (1877), Dieckmann (1885), Drawbaugh
      (1879), Snow (1874), Spaulding (1885), and Stubblefield (1898)
      produce usable power. In addition to these marvelous patents,
      there are those which found their way into telephonic service
      later: designs by Strong (1880), Brown (1881), Tomkins (1881),
      Lockwood (1881) provided power assistance and primary power for
      telephonic systems through out the countryside.<br>
      <br>
      The well reputed fame of "earth batteries" centers around their
      very anomalous electrical behavior. The central mystery about
      earth batteries is that they do not corrode to the degree in which
      their electrical production rate theoretically demands. Exhumed
      earth batteries reveal little surface corrosion.<br>
      <br>
      Nathan Stubblefield knew that probes (placed into various soils)
      reveal an amazing degree of strong electrical activity. These
      currents show an amazing degree of variation across any chosen
      plot of ground. Wet soils often reverse the expected electrical
      strength: weakening, instead of strengthening their appearance.
      Proper placements of metallic probes can produce strong currents
      for use.<br>
      <br>
      Touching a well-grounded iron rod is a good first experiment to
      try in these regards. Try and find a place where power leakage
      into the ground is minimal, such as a park or wooded area. Take a
      yard-long solid iron rod whose surface is free of shellac or
      insulator coatings. Carefully drive the rod into the ground with a
      hammer. Wetted hands on the iron should produce a mild electrical
      sensation. These voltages may be measured. They "pin" sensitive
      galvanometers. The current does not cease after several weeks of
      activity when properly placed.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield's observations of natural electrical manifestations
      led him to consider the taking of "free" electrical energy from
      the earth. His initial revelation contended that such vast amounts
      of energy could be used to drive the engineworks of industry.
      Stubblefield sensed that the ground currents were arriving as [15]
      electrical waves.<br>
      <br>
      In Stubblefield's view the electrical waves permeate the earth.
      Electrical waves were treated as ocean waves, constantly surging
      and cresting in specific locales. As ocean waves crash against
      fixed shores and rocks, so electrical waves also surge and crash
      against underground geological features. Stubblefield reasoned
      that this electroactivity should be extreme in certain locales:
      the "rocky shores" of the electrical ocean. Just as there are
      rocky shores, calm beaches, and surging ocean depths, Stubblefield
      clearly envisioned the mysterious dark waves of the vast and
      unsuspected electrical ocean.<br>
      <br>
      Knowing these truths, Stubblefield arranged ground rods in
      specific locales in order to intercept the electrical waves for
      power. He knew that these electrical waves would only appear in
      very specific places, so he did not expect to find them everywhere
      in abundance. Stubblefield constantly spoke of "working the
      ground" before power could be taken from it.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield observed the natural tides and boundaries of the
      electrical ocean in and around his lovely rural hometown.
      Concerning this earth energy, Tesla and other investigators later
      developed equivalent models. Tesla charted and used the earth
      waves in their surging impulses. Moray also intercepted these
      natural impulses in the "radiant energy" generator.<br>
      <br>
      Some researchers believed that the vast electrical ground
      reservoir finds its source in the enormous solar efflux. Certainly
      daytime grounds yield a remarkable amount of static. Ground
      terminal shortwave reception is excessively "choked" during the
      daylight hours on certain bands. Despite the supposed insulative
      qualities of the atmosphere the solar efflux finds its way through
      space, eventually permeating the ground. Some researchers have
      referred to the ground-permeating solar energy as the "slow solar
      discharge".<br>
      <br>
      The "slow discharge" represents the enormous drift of aether
      through the entire body of ground. The earth evidences a
      constantly self regenerating charge. Tesla opposed the notion that
      this potent field was the result of decaying radioactive materials
      deep in the crust.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous other researchers would refer to this "electrical ocean"
      as the vast reservoir of untapped natural energy. Somehow this
      reservoir is regenerated in a constant swelling. Where did the
      energy come from? Earth static was presumed by Tesla to be a solar
      activity which manifested in and across the ground. The ever
      growing static of earth was problematic for physicists who could
      not see the source for such energetic growth potentials. Tesla
      believed that ultrafine corpuscles from the sun permeated the
      entire earth, manifesting as static charge, and further
      conjectured that these rays came primarily from the sun, since it
      was ejecting matter "at excessively high voltages". If this were
      so, reasoned Tesla, then sunlight contained something of this
      electroactive component, and it was certainly possible to derive
      electrical energy from sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      Nikola Tesla announced these facts in 1894, finding only the
      silencing ridicule of academicians already hating his very name.
      When Tesla declared that "rays from space" were "bombarding the
      earth" he was absolutely rejected by the academic club who
      rejected these claims as "superstitious". Upbraiding his findings,
      they later claimed for themselves the very same discovery
      (Millikan, 1932).<br>
      <br>
      Tesla stated that the electrical energy released by the sun is a
      far greater, more permeating supply than sunlight itself. He
      certainly believed it should be considered as a first rate natural
      electrical source of enormous potential for commercial
      applications. His assertion was based on experimentally verified
      facts when, measuring steadily growing charge states in vacuum
      tubes, it occurred to him that earth charge was sourced in solar
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      Tesla also demonstrated the extraction of free electrical power
      from solar energy. A well grounded mica capacitor is surmounted by
      a highly polished zinc plate. This plate may be poised in a highly
      evacuated glass container to best advantage, the zinc not exposed
      to corrosive influences. The tube is elevated and exposed to
      sunlight. The mica capacitor is connected in series with the
      vacuum tube. After only several minutes of exposure time, the
      stored electrical energy is formidable: producing a powerful white
      arc discharge.<br>
      <br>
      Tesla patented this device. Since earth absorbs the permeating
      solar efflux, then these energies can be extracted for aeons.<br>
      <br>
      Others have viewed the generation of ground static as a natural
      "radiant process" from the ground itself. Static charge appears as
      the inert by-product of the mysterious VRIL, the self magnifying
      organismic ground energy. VRIL, according to medieval mystical
      philosophers, is the ground of being from which all material
      manifestations emerge. VRIL connectively fuses metaphysical
      realities (dream, vision, ideation, impulse) with physical
      realities. (mineralogy, botany, zoology). By the radionic method
      by which telegraph lines may be locally "tuned" we may well
      surmise that this ground based regenerative supply is the true
      source of static.<br>
      <br>
      Samuel Morse originally planned the burial of telegraphic lines
      between cities. Having done so across several tens of miles at
      great expense and through great labor, Morse found his system
      utterly incapable of operation. Static had so flooded his
      receivers that no signalling was possible at all. This first bad
      experience with the static of ground presented such a
      discouragement, that he almost stopped the entire plan. The
      uneconomical task of elevating all his cables later became the
      normal procedure.<br>
      <br>
      Early telegraphers observed a steady growth of static throughout
      night seasons. This growth continued despite the absence of winds
      or storm conditions anywhere along the line. Researchers have
      often referred to this kind of power as "free energy", meaning
      that the power source is extraterrestrial and natural in supply.
      Such an energy source would remain cost-free. The privatization of
      utility companies could conceivably be municipal and democratic;
      municipal groups could share the cost of installing the ground
      energy stations.<br>

          U.S. Patent No. 600,457 - N. B. Stubblefield, Electrical
          Battery - Patented Mar. 8, 1898.</i><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Mr. Stubblefield developed a peculiar bi-metallic induction coil
      which could (when buried) draw up sufficient electrical power to
      operate lamps and other appliances which he designed and tested.
      The patent specification describes a terminal which draws
      electricity out of the ground. This device required very specific
      placement — it would not work with equal effectiveness in all
      locations. A very precise placement of the device required an
      equally precise knowledge, and Stubblefield shared this knowledge
      with only a few of his associates.<br>
      <br>
      I spoke with an academician who had the extreme privilege of
      speaking with Mr. Stubblefield's son, Bernard Stubblefield.
      Bernard, by this time himself quite aged, told that his father's
      method in locating the "right spot" was deliberate. His father
      referred to the device as indeed a receptive terminal and not a
      battery.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the insistence of Patent Officers in calling the device a
      "battery", Stubblefield declared it to be an energy receiver, a
      receptive cell for intercepting electrical ground waves. Its
      conductive ability somehow absorbs and directs enormous volumes of
      electrical energy. With this energy Nathan Stubblefield operated a
      score of arc lamps at full brightness for twenty four hours a day.<br>
      <br>
      It becomes apparent that Mr. Stubblefield had witnessed (or
      experienced) some natural occurrence of discharging electrical
      energy in a telephonic system, and had determined the mode of its
      manifestation with simple means. His ground energy receiver (Pat.
      600,457) remains a true electrician's mystery. There was a
      definite trigger by which this energy was stimulated and
      maintained. The induction coil which bears his name is equipped
      with three coils which are wrapped around upon a heavy iron core.
      Bare iron wire and cotton covered copper wire are wrapped side by
      side, comprising a primary coil body. Each layer of this primary
      coil body is covered by a band of cotton insulation, bringing four
      wire leads to the coil terminus. Two leads of iron and two of
      copper are external to the coil. Commercial-electrical power is
      obtained through these connective terminals.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to this bimetallic winding, there is a third winding:
      the "secondary". This third coil is insulated from the primary
      bimetallic coil, serving as a trigger device. Presumably, a
      stimulating impulse shock was introduced into the tertiary coil,
      after which the upwelling electrical ground response brought forth
      powerful currents in both iron and copper coils.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolytically (as a battery in acid or saltwater) the
      Stubblefield coil is disappointing, producing less than one volt
      according to those who have duplicated its construction.
      Stubblefield's bimetallic coil was a "plug": a receiver which
      intercepts the vast and free electrical reservoir of the ground
      itself. His patent and subsequent company brochures define the
      manner in which his earth battery was to be activated.<br>
      <br>
      Technically, the Stubblefield device is a modified thermocouple (a
      bimetal in tight surface contact) but could not supply the degree
      of power which he reported. While this arrangement could develop a
      few milliwatts of power in appropriately hot ground spots, the
      thermoelectric explanation of the device cannot explain the
      phenomenal output reported in news reports of Stubblefield's
      demonstrations.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, though the Stubblefield power receiver is wound like
      an induction coil, it produces a steady direct current output.
      This poses additional problems for the conventional engineers.
      Electrical induction only occurs with electrical alternations,
      oscillations, and impulses. Witnesses described ground-powered
      motors which ran unceasingly and unattended for months without
      need for replacing or replenishing the ground battery. Small
      machinery, clocks, and loud gongs were run by other ground-buried
      cells as reported by credible witnesses.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Stubblefield reported that the burial of his "earth energy
      cell" required time to build up charge. Once the cell was
      saturated, however, the cell became a conduit of earth charge and
      flowed over in "commercial electrical volumes". He did not claim
      complete knowledge of the phenomenon. He simply stated that (once
      the coil became saturated with the earth charge) it suddenly
      manifested an electromotive force "far greater than any known wet
      cell reaching into weeks and months of continuous work night and
      day" and poured this charge out for use.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield used the cell as a "plug", drawing out the electrical
      charge of the ground. The cell coilings acted as a lumped
      conductor. Charge saturated this conductor and flowed up into it,
      powering any electrically connected appliance. After repeated
      exhumations, the copper element of these cells "is not acted on in
      a perceptible degree . . . even after repeated renewals".<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Stubblefield described means by which such cells could be
      connected in series at short distances from one another. "With
      these, acting as electrodes . . . you draw from the electrical
      energy of the earth a constant E.M.F. of commercial value". The
      phrase "acting as electrodes" is the heart of the Stubblefield
      energy cell. It is not a battery. It absorbs and flows over with
      the stupendous energy of the earth's charge. Stubblefield may have
      discovered the auto-magnifying voltage effect of electrostatic
      induction in coils before Tesla, who later utilized the effect in
      his special electrostatic transformers.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield's buried bifilar coils may have become saturated with
      earth electrostatic energy, travelling up the coil. In such a
      case, the mere battery power of the coil was replaced by the
      electrostatic flow, the coil acting as an electrode. This seemed
      obvious when considering the fact that its ordinary battery
      current (1 watt) was gradually replaced by a continually growing
      electrical current of far greater proportion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TREE ROOTS</b><br>
      <br>
      Experimenters have observed the "slow accumulation and creep" of
      current up through vertically buried coils and large solid rods.
      This current has growth characteristics which gains strength with
      lengthened burial time. Buried coils and rods do not give their
      full output until they have "developed" power over a few hours of
      time.<br>
      <br>
      This behavior resembles nothing like a true electrical current.
      The best model to explain the phenomenon is vegetative growth — a
      biological expression. Only a full scale test of the reconstructed
      Stubblefield device in proper grounds will give conclusive and
      satisfying answers.<br>
      <br>
      Witnesses convey that Mr. Stubblefield's batteries were usually
      buried at the roots of certain very old oak trees. From these
      sites it was possible for him to bring small arc lamps to their
      full candlepower. Tremendous amounts of energy are required for
      this expenditure of power. Not only was he remarkably able to draw
      such volumes of current from the ground reservoir for lamp
      lighting, but the power was available to him throughout the day.
      Arc lamps were hung in the trees themselves with their receiver
      coils buried in the roots. Such was the nature of this current
      that the lamps did not heat excessively, and seemed to burn
      forever.<br>
      <br>
      Nathan was not replacing his lamps with the frequency demanded by
      such continuous operation. Obtained through his employment with
      the telephone company, he was able to recharge old wetcell [17]
      batteries with energy from these buried receivers for other
      experiment. Certain conventional thinkers claimed that the
      Stubblefield simply used wetcell power for his telephones. Later
      demonstrations indicate the fundamental error of this conventional
      view. Stubblefield ran most of his apparatus nonstop for days —
      without turning off the power.<br>
      <br>
      It is more than likely that charged wetcells were used to "jump
      start" the ground electrode during certain seasons, since the
      patent reveals that an outer third coil could be added to the
      copper-iron bimetal. We do not know the secrets of the earth
      charge as Nathan determined. Others since this time have observed
      fluctuations at certain times of the year in ground energy. It may
      be that a sudden induction is required before the excess ground
      charge surges to the surface — like priming a pump.<br>
      <br>
      The arc lamps could have been low pressure gas arc-lamps of the
      kind demonstrated by Daniel MacFarland-Moore; but these required
      high voltages. Nathan did not utilize such excessive voltages.
      Another paradox deals with the notion that Stubblefield simply
      connected hundreds of his small-wattage batteries together,
      producing a large and commercial output. Nowhere is this
      evidenced. Nathan showed that one or two such batteries were
      sufficient to draw off "the charge of the earth" . . . a very
      different kind of energy.<br>
      <br>
      When properly placed, the weak power of the Stubblefield "battery"
      becomes an electrode for the powerful earth charge. But arc
      lighting and battery charging was not his only specialty; there
      were other marvels which he began developing in methodic
      succession. His bimetallic coil receiver intercepted electrical
      waves and produced enormous power outputs which could be
      modulated: superimposed with additional signals, sounds, and
      voices.<br>
      <br>
      <b>GROUND RADIO</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Salva (1795) suggested several electrical schemes for
      long-distance, and even an aquatic telegraphy. He suggested that
      physiophonic telegraphy be the communications mode; where human
      recipients would receive the mild shocks of a distant signal
      station, and so convey messages.<br>
      <br>
      Salva also believed that earthquakes had subterranean electric
      origins. Working on the hypothesis that subterranean electricity
      caused violent communications under vast earth strata, Salva
      suggested that ground and water be used to replace wires for
      electrical signalling.<br>
      <br>
      Sommerring (1811) first attempted telegraphic transmissions
      through water-filled wooden tubs. The signals were effectively
      passed as if through wire conductors, the thought of wireless
      ground resulting.<br>
      <br>
      James Lindsay (1830) first developed the notion of utilizing
      artificially generated electricity for special modes of lighting,
      motor-power, and communication. Mr. Lindsay suggested that
      submarine cables might be laid between land masses while using
      "earth batteries and bare wires" as the means for power transfer.<br>
      <br>
      Steinheil (1838) demonstrated the remarkable passage of signals
      along one-wire to the ground. When trying to use earth as the
      "second line" he measured large currents. This complete success
      proved the great conductivity of ground; and so the "earth
      circuit" was born, liberating telegraph systems from the expense
      of using the two-wire system.<br>
      <br>
      Morse (1842) sent telegraph signals across a river. Antonio Meucci
      (1852) had already demonstrated the transmission of vocal signals
      through seawater, but traversing the ground represents a different
      thing altogether. Mr. Stubblefield reasoned that, since electrical
      waves traverse the whole earth, it might be possible to send
      signals to distant places. These ground-permeating natural
      electrical waves might serve as carriers for the human voice. The
      ground would act as both power generator and signal conductor.
      Like a gale carrying messages downwind, these electrical waves
      could bring wireless communications instantly to any part of the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      To this end, Mr. Stubblefield experimented with the buried power
      receiver and a system of telephone sets. He found it possible to
      send vocal signals through the ground to a distant receiver,
      referring to this system as a "ground telephone". Telephoning
      through the ground became routine for this remarkable man. Signals
      sent through the Stubblefield method were notable for their
      reported "great clarity". What is strange about this system is its
      elegant simplicity: Stubblefield's transmitting system evidences
      an almost crude minimalism which offends some researchers, while
      surprising others.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous private and public demonstrations of this first system
      were made in Murray, Kentucky (1886-1892), where the mysterious
      "black boxes" were seen. Two metal rods were stuck into the ground
      a few feet apart from each distantly placed set. Speech between
      the two sets was clear, loud, and startling despite distances of
      3500 to 6000 feet. These transmissions were made through the
      ground itself and used the Stubblefield cell for power.<br>
      <br>
      As mentioned, in several photographs we see special loudspeaking
      telephones outfitted with long (1 foot) horns, designed to act as
      annunciators. Calls from these annunciators brought his son
      Bernard to the telephone transmitter. The system was never
      switched off. Power was limitless and did not diminish with time
      of day or length of use.<br>
      <br>
      While Marconi and others were barely managing the transmission of
      telegraph signals for equivalent distances, Nathan Stubblefield
      was transmitting vocal dialogue. The clarity of these signals and
      their sheer volume was the most widely recognized feature of the
      Stubblefield system. He was developing the system to operate
      through far greater distances, using automatic relays to boost
      signals for very great distances.<br>
      <br>
      He published an extraordinary brochure in 1898 to attract
      investors who had expressed interest in consolidating a small
      corporation. In this brochure, Stubblefield insisted that power
      for his device was not generated in the cell. He calmly stated
      that the cell received energy from the earth. In a less discussed
      portion of this brochure, Stubblefield stated that
      electrotherapeutic potentials were derived from the earth battery.
      Other researchers made similar claims for their earth batteries
      (Hicks, Mellon).<br>
      <br>
      In 1902, Stubblefield set up one of his sets in a "Mainstreet"
      upper office — in a hardware shop. From that point to his farm
      (some 6000 feet distant) he conducted continuous conversations
      with his son Bernard. Tapping with a pencil on his one-piece
      transceiver, Bernard was quickly heard in aloud, very clear voice.
      This transceiver was a carbon button placed in a tin snuff box.
      Speech and response were transacted through the self-same device,
      [18] which acted as both microphone and loudspeaker. Cells were
      placed downstairs from the office in the ground. They were never
      removed and never wore out, though operating twenty four hours
      around the clock.<br>
      <br>
      Nathan Stubblefield offered to construct a large scale power
      station for the town of Murray. His quoted initial installation
      cost were estimated at five thousand dollars. The town politicians
      declined the offer. Now, the technique of drawing up electricity
      from the earth remains a mystery.<br>

      <b>STATIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      The Stubblefield ground radio system was demonstrated for
      approximately one thousand Murray residents (January 1902).
      Photographs of Stubblefield and his family, and a good crowd of
      witnesses from town show the cell lying on the ground among all
      his assembled inventions; a flower-pot sized coil of good volume.
      Other devices show motors and large capacitor stacks for aerial
      voice transmission experiments.<br>
      <br>
      After the successful completion of these preliminary tests,
      Stubblefield travelled to Washington, D.C. for a public
      demonstration which was to be one of his crowning public
      achievements (March 1902). Stubblefield sent wireless messages
      from a steamship to stations on the shores of Georgetown. This
      successful test employed trail-wires in the river water. While
      successful, witnesses acknowledged that Stubblefield's ground
      telephony sounded louder and came through with greater clarity.
      Photographs of this event are all available.<br>
      <br>
      He declared that news, weather, and other announcements could be
      broadcast through the ground across a great territory for private
      reception. Simultaneous messages and news of all kinds would soon
      be transmitted through the ground from a central distribution
      station.<br>
      <br>
      He also stated that (while such broadcasts required wide
      transmissions) he was developing a means by which privacy of
      ground telephonic messages could be maintained among callers. This
      method of individuation would take place through the ground,
      insuring that no one could eavesdrop on anyone's conversations.<br>
      <br>
      The Washington D.C. demonstrations were followed by a trip further
      north. Mr. Stubblefield took his apparatus to New York City for
      additional tests, preparing for a public demonstration in
      Manhattan's Central Park. The demonstration was to take place in
      less than twenty four hours after his arrival.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield found (to his shock) that the ground was not
      permeable to earth charge in all places, and not conducive to easy
      ground telephony. He requested more time to discover the
      powerpoints before setting up the stations properly. Time to "work
      the stony earth" of the Park left a few investors foolishly wary
      of the system's worth. This demonstration was withdrawn.<br>
      <br>
      His next public expositions were given in Philadelphia's Fairmont
      Park with greater success (May 1902). He now recognized, more than
      ever before, the role of geologic formations in determining and
      establishing stations.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield published a prospectus for his WTCA (Wireless
      Telephone Company of America), stating that "I can telephone
      without wires a mile or more now, and when the more powerful
      apparatus I am working on is finished and combined with further
      developments, the distance will be unlimited". He sold only one
      telephonic system to another corporation: the Gordon Telephone
      Company of Charleston. This system was used to communicate with
      offshore islands. It would be interesting to retrieve this system
      and examine its contents.<br>
      <br>
      He entered these commercial aspects with some trepidation. By June
      of the same year he withdrew from the project completely. A few
      persons managed to discover the reason for his quiet, sudden
      retreat. Because of his difficulty in instantly stationing his
      system in New York City, it was suggested that he adopt the method
      of burying lines to "fake" the operation — if just for the purpose
      of making a good show. Nathan declined.<br>
      <br>
      After witnessing these demonstrations, another inventor (A. F.
      Collins) duplicated some of Nathan's inventions and filed a
      counter-patent for a ground telephonic system (patent 814,942 for
      "Wireless Telephony", 1906). One of the signing witnesses on the
      Collins patent was one Walton Harrison.<br>
      <br>
      Harrison, a WTCA member later infringed on another Stubblefield
      experiment with his "Transmitter for Wireless Communication", a
      telegraphic-telephonic system (patent 1,119,952, 1914). It became
      apparent that certain WTCA members were trying to oust
      Stubblefield himself!<br>
      <br>
      The WTCA now took on a life of its own. Stubblefield was
      thoroughly disgusted at the display of human greed and ambition,
      and left them to their own devising. Collins and others were later
      accused of petty crimes having to do with mail fraud, and the WTCA
      failed in time. Internal disputes over money, rather than
      technological progress and implementation, was their own death
      knell.<br>
      <br>
      Marconi arrived with an inferior (though highly publicized)
      system. When Marconi began his work, the effective signal
      transmission distance was equal to that achieved by Stubblefield.
      Stubblefield was experimenting with ground radio since 1888, but
      did not patent his developments until much later. Credible
      witnesses saw his ground radio experiments in action during this
      time frame, establishing the historical priority of Stubblefield —
      a true and original American genius.<br>
      <br>
      While Marconi could barely send telegraphic "dot and dash" signals
      with great difficulty (and static), Nathan had already transmitted
      the human voice with loud, velvet clarity. Others would adopt and
      implement the Collins system (Fessenden, DeForest, Bethenod,
      Braun).<br>
      <br>
      Nikola Tesla performed double ground experiments with impulses as
      early as 1892, reporting these in lectures and patenting some
      embodiments in 1901. No one of these later systems ever achieved
      the same results of clarity, tone, and volume of Stubblefield
      ground telephony. Priority in this art belongs to Nathan
      Stubblefield. In addition, his was the only system in which
      natural energies were obtained, magnified, and entirely employed
      as the empowering source. All the other inventors used
      "artificial" sources (batteries, alternators, dynamos).<br>
      <br>
      Following all these ground radio demonstrations, Stubblefield
      researched "magnetic waves" and developed several systems which
      did not use ground terminals for exchanging signals. Long distance
      wireless telephone communications were his aim. Many imagined this
      to be radio as we know it, but several features of the
      Stubblefield aerial system are distinctive and different. First,
      his transmitters and receivers were telephonic, [19] not
      telegraphic. In his preliminary experiments, the earth battery was
      used to energize an apparatus to which was connected a long
      horizontal aerial line. Marconi later adopted this "bent L"
      symmetry in conjunction with a grounded copper conduction screen.
      We do not have photographs of these arrays, but have handwritten
      manuscript copies of certain diary notes in which a progressively
      greater telephonic distance is reported. Nathan made steady
      progress in this form of telephonic transmission, but used neither
      alternators or spark discharge.<br>
      <br>
      A second series of experiments reveal the development of stacked
      capacitors. Photographs reveal two large capacitor stacks,
      presumably for inductive transmission purposes. Some researchers
      induced ground oscillations of electrical current, while absorbing
      each "flyback" into large capacitors. This system evidenced the
      "hydraulic" model of electricity, popular during the latter
      Victorian Epoch.<br>
      <br>
      Tesla would later show the essential differences between current
      species developed in various electrical machines. Each of these,
      when separated, evidenced entirely unsuspected new phenomena. It
      is most probable that Stubblefield was one of the first
      individuals to discover some of these strange effects, even before
      Tesla himself.<br>
      <br>
      Direct current impulses have very different characteristics than
      alternating high frequency currents, used by Marconi. Vocal
      modulations of strong direct currents release polarized impulses.
      Impulses do not produce the inductive waves used in conventional
      radio transmission: they produce inductive rays which travel in
      straight lines. These inductive rays are penetrating and more like
      electrostatic energy than electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      Photographs reveal a final form of Stubblefield's aerial telephone
      which utilizes a two foot in diameter single turn copper band.
      This outer copper band is spaced from a second inner copper band,
      and is mounted on wooden pedestals. A telephone is connected to
      this array. This compact apparatus transmitted inductive rays for
      great distances when earth energy was modulated by the human
      voice.<br>
      <br>
      A truly honest and humble man, he justly considered the ambitious
      and aggressive (northern) investors as "scalawags and damned
      rascals". He became suspicious of others. Considering the time
      frame in which these events took place, we may understand his
      reaction. Rejecting their tempting swindle, he was compelled to
      leave for home in order to continue his beloved experiments in
      privacy. He became mysteriously compulsive about his privacy after
      this.<br>
      <br>
      In the words of several persons with which I have had the good
      fortune to speak, "Nathan was honest to a fault". He, disappointed
      again in human behavior, packed away his equipment and went home.
      After this unfortunate time period, Mr. Stubblefield preferred to
      be alone. Some say he became increasingly intolerable to be with.
      These patterns mark the genius, the dreamer. Those who walk in the
      future, while being in the here and now. Finally, his wife left
      him.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOMESTEAD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As visitors approached the Stubblefield farm, yet a good way off,
      Stubblefield would appear at the door to wave them away. This
      often occurred when they were simply too far away to be visually
      located. He refused to speak to anyone for long periods. This
      occurrence was reported during the night, when visibility from the
      cabin to the distant parts of his fields would be impossible.
      Nathan would always appear at the door, somehow knowingly, and
      wave them off.<br>
      <br>
      Pranking schoolboys, intent on stealing vegetables or fruits,
      would ever so secretly crawl onto his farm quite out of possible
      sight. Nathan would always be right next to them laughing in no
      time, somehow mysteriously detecting their presence. In a later
      embodiment, bells would sound when anyone approached so much as a
      half-mile from his cabin. It has been suggested that he had
      developed a device which could actually indicate the positions of
      any intruder across a space of ground.<br>
      <br>
      Some declared that Nathan, jealous of his privacy, rigged the
      whole farm with delicate trip wires in order to locate and
      surprise pranksters. Sometimes the intruders would be met by
      Stubblefield, waiting at the very spot where they were stealthily
      heading. No intruder ever managed to feel or find these supposed
      wires. Others would say that Nathan buried sound-sensors all over
      the farm. These, when pressed, could model a trace across a map of
      the farm inside the cabin. Each sensor, tied to an indicator,
      could show up on the map, and studying this map, he could see
      where intruders were on the fields. Nathan could then gleefully
      sneak up on them and chase them away. This tantalizing mystery has
      never been fully explored.<br>
      <br>
      Methods of distant ranging and location were devised by Antonio
      Meucci, employing tone signals. These required receivers, however,
      at the distant end. But Nathan knew where the intruders were
      coming from and where they were going as well. Nathan may have
      developed ground-wireless relays which responded to ground-buried
      sensors. These may have transmitted a tonal signal to the cabin,
      where a receiver would he triggered. This receiver may have been
      the bell-sounding mechanism. How did he locate people with pin
      point. accuracy however? No complex array of detectors was ever
      found in his cabin when he died.<br>
      <br>
      In light of all his experimentation with earth energy and
      wireless, we will assume that his last two mysterious inventions
      speak of utterly new and unknown (though related) ground energy
      phenomena. But, what natural phenomenon permitted him to achieve
      this feat?<br>
      <br>
      Ocean waves often contour the shoreline, evidencing something of
      the shore outlines to distant places. Electrical waves might
      conceivably do this. But how would Nathan model this inside his
      cabin? No such map was ever really found. Also, if he were using
      some kind of ground impulse Doppler radar or sonar (electrical
      ground impulses outward) then what feature beneath the approaching
      intruders would signal an echo back to the receiver?<br>
      <br>
      Some have suggested that Stubblefield was utilizing distant
      variable ground conductivity. Intruders would alter this by their
      weight and step. How would such a signal be transferred back to
      the measuring station? Such reciprocation in ground currents would
      require that they are irritable and sensitive. This would evidence
      an unsuspected permeating biological nature in geology; a song, a
      personality with which the old linesmen~dowsers were intimate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MOTORS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A motor, designed by Stubblefield to operate entirely by [20]
      fluctuations in ground static, has been stored in a local museum.
      The device features several mobile pithballs around a compass-like
      perimeter, resembling the equally mysterious electrostatic hoop
      telegraphs of the 1700's. Students of Stubblefield's work have
      examined the pithball pendulum device and ignorantly concluded it
      to be useless.<br>
      <br>
      Pithball (static) telegraphs of the early 1700's reveal this
      Stubblefield design to be a very special "find". Pithball
      telegraphs utilized a grounded metal hoop, an underlying dial, and
      a pendulum on which a pithball (cork) was hung. A single line
      (sometimes of silk) connected two such arrangements.<br>
      <br>
      Signals were made and received in a very curious manner with
      pithball hoops, an equally historic mystery. Moving the pithball
      to a particular letter on the dial resulted in identical
      displacements in the receiver: an anomaly. These arcane devices
      managed the articulate transaction of messages by unknown
      phenomena approaching intelligent transfer.<br>
      <br>
      Witnesses of these signalling devices were credible persons in the
      scientific community. No one questioned how it was possible to
      articulate such a transfer with static electricity. In any event,
      any researcher not familiar with the designs would pass over
      Stubblefield's "pithball table" without counting it as worthy of
      study.<br>
      <br>
      Another device, found in Nathan's cabin after he passed away, is
      of singular mystery. One person actually thought that Nathan built
      it because it "looked really strange" — like some science artform.
      It sat upon a trunk of to the side of his cabin room. Bernard
      Stubblefield, his son, did not recognize the device. Nathan must
      have built it after Bernard was taken away with his mother.
      Bernard did not remember seeing the device before this moment. It
      was taken to a local museum, where it now resides.<br>
      <br>
      The device is a square arrangement, having several
      insulator-mounted pithballs in each quadrant of the central square
      table. It is quite likely that this was the means by which Nathan
      detected movements and positions in his field. If this analysis
      proves true, then it represents a major leap in his earth power
      technology. I have surmised that this device is the Stubblefield
      long-range detector. Motions in a specific pithball pendulum gave
      the direction and position of the intruder. Such a device relies
      on phenomena which are unknown in conventional science.<br>
      <br>
      Natural observations in systems lead to unexpected, theory-busting
      discoveries. Such an effect demonstrates that an articulate
      quasi-intelligent energy permeates the natural environment of
      which electricity is a minor part. The natural phenomenon which is
      responsible for this ability is truly remarkable, nothing short of
      the miraculous. In its realm, we see that nature is suffused with
      an almost biological organization which includes the supposed
      inert world of geology. This would be equivalent to acknowledging
      that geological structure is suffused with a neurological
      sensitivity; a thing which academic science is neither prepared
      nor equipped to endorse. Nevertheless, different aspects of this
      ground sensitivity were discovered and differently implemented
      throughout the following years.<br>
      <br>
      T. H. Moray (1935) also discovered long-range articulate tuning
      through the ground from a fixed single site. His "radiant energy
      listening device" permitted him to scan a tract of land and
      actually eavesdrop on distant conversations and sounds with
      earphones. This device did not implement a microphone: the Moray
      Listening Device used a grounded rod and special large germanium
      detector. How does a stationary tuner sweep across land and
      pinpoint sound sources?<br>
      <br>
      Stanley Rogers (1932) discovered the same long-range scanning
      effect when, using a radionic tuner for mineral detection, he
      found it possible to sweep a field or meadow with a variable
      capacitor. Adjustments on these grounded tuners could sweep across
      land, revealing and mapping every mineral contour. Dr. Ruth Drown
      (1951) independently, developed a compact device which could
      sweep, scan, and delve through subterranean grounds for the
      specific purpose of ore detection. This device permitted
      photographic detection of ores swept through the ground, isolating
      specifically sought mineral deposits.<br>
      <br>
      The Stubblefield pithball pendulum represents a leap in ground
      power technology. It is an engine which operates without
      electrical transformations at all: a ground-powered "auric"
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUNLIGHT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Two more mysteries have lingered from this latter period of
      invention in the Stubblefield biography. The nature of each
      reveals the extent to which he had developed and advanced his new
      technology. Nathan continued to pursue his experiments, but little
      was seen of him for long time periods. Alone and tired, Nathan
      stopped working his farm completely.<br>
      <br>
      Later visitors felt sorry for Nathan, now aged and abandoned by
      his wife and children. Several of the town's many charitable
      ladies decided to take him some food. On one occasion, they
      arrived at his farm to find the ground "ablaze with light . . .
      like pure sunlight was coming right up out of the hillside". Later
      investigators entered his land area and found heavy wires leading
      from the roots of trees. To these wires were attached small arc
      lamps, hung in the trees. These were long extinguished. They
      imagined this to be the explanation of his hillside sunlight.
      Their hasty analysis proved problematic from stories which
      witnesses report.<br>
      <br>
      The warm and diffuse sunlight which came from the ground itself
      around his house was not localized in specific lamps. The light
      came from the ground, not from the trees as before "a whole
      hillside that would blossom with light" [. . .] "lit up like
      daytime". These observations indicate that Stubblefield had
      managed indeed the direct conversion of earth energy to light and
      warmth.<br>
      <br>
      This would be acceptable, were Mr. Stubblefield simply working on
      a newer means of drawing electricity from the ground to light
      small arc-lamps; a feat which he had accomplished earlier. But
      these kind persons could never find any evidence of arc-lighting
      or any other form of known lighting anywhere near the area. In
      their own words "the light seemed to come from the ground itself".
      In addition to the ground sunlight effect, many heard very loud
      and unfamiliar noises coming from the whole area surrounding his
      cabin. What could this be? Had he managed to directly transduce
      the natural impulses of the ground energy into audio?<br>
      <br>
      His own last claim, made two weeks before he passed away was made
      to a kind neighbor: "The past is nothing. I have perfected now the
      greatest invention the world has ever known . . . I have taken
      light from the air and earth . . . as I did sound".<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUNSET</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I was the quite fortunate recipient of an unexpected personal
      letter while writing my original treatise on Nathan Stubblefield.
      It was told by a gentleman who received the account through a man
      who witnessed the following story:<br>
      <br>
      Neighbors had not seen Nathan for several days. As they were
      worried about his health, they attempted to call on him. The lock
      was secured from the inside. It was a lonely, cold, and rainy
      March day when old friends and neighbors broke the lock on
      Nathan's cabin and entered. He had passed away in his bed, the
      probable victim of malnutrition and fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      They all noticed that the interior of the cabin was "toasty warm",
      as if heated by a strong fire. Moved to locate the source of this
      heat, town officials found "two highly polished metal mirrors
      which faced each other, radiating this great heat in rippling
      waves".<br>
      <br>
      Now this, I must say, is a truly great discovery and last mystery.
      It fulfills what Nathan reported in his last testimony. Nathan's
      deepest confidence was in those kind and compassionate people who
      continued to seek him out with love and concern to his last days.
      Abandoned by all, he wished one of his dearest neighbors to write
      a biography. Perhaps he wished to explain his life, an apology for
      all his ways. He said "I have lived fifty years ahead of everybody
      else". While often sounding inspirational, these are words of
      deepest sorrow.<br>
      <br>
      To live with a vision of the future is to experience the
      surprising, often disappointing rejection and resistance of all
      who surround. The conspiracy of human nature. Some said he was
      incapable of loving others. It was his love which coaxed the
      living sunshine out of hard, rocky ground. And his love brought up
      the resounding waves of an eternal sea of energy. Love, like the
      rose, often hides within its shelter of thorns; singing lonely,
      windy songs to the deep. In endless dreams of night, the stars
      listen.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      I built a 6" acrylic frame for the coil. That way I can insert
      different cores, or no core. I also built this winding machine
      yesterday. I've had the motor for some time and it has a nice
      reduction gear box on it. I also put a foot switch on it so I can
      have my hands free.<br>
      <br>
      Theres no speed control, but the price was right since I salvaged
      the motor. The speed is fine for most winds anyway.<br>
      <br>
      I suppose I should also get a counter for it, but I don't
      generally use one. It would be nice for the new motor though.
      Balancing the coils would be better than guessing.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, I decided to start with 20 AWG wire. I got 150 feet of
      both bare copper and steel. I have a plan to weave the cotton into
      the wind so I won't need cloth covered wire.<br>
      <br>
      We'll see how it goes...<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="coilwinder.jpg" height="370"

      <div align="center">***<br>
      </div>
      I got a few layers put on today. I wound one row of steel, then
      put a layer of cotton down. Then I wound a row of copper. I left
      enough space between the loops to keep them insulated from one
      another, and to have a space for the next winding to fit into.<br>
      <br>
      Each row is a separate strand and I just connect them at the ends.
      This makes it much easier to wind.<br>
      <br>
      I think in the end the result will be satisfactory since the
      copper will be right next to the steel, separated by a layer of
      cotton and all the layers will be in series.<br>
      <br>
      I haven't taken any measurements yet except to check for shorts. I
      should have it done by tomorrow and then we'll see if it works.<br>
      <br>
      Cheers,<br>
      Ted<br>

      <br>
      Finished it. It took forever to wind. I used about 200 feet of
      both copper and steel 20awg wire. <br>
      <br>
      The dry voltage across the coil was .69 volts with the copper
      positive. Current was a minuscule 40 ua.<br>
      <br>
      I sprayed it with some tap water, which got about a third of the
      layers wet, and the voltage went up to .75 volts. The current
      jumped up to 19 ma.<br>
      <br>
      The current and voltage were unaffected by inserting an iron core
      into the coil. The iron did polarized and would deflect a compass
      at either end. However, I couldn't get any response from either
      the compass or a piece of steel wire when I shorted the coil.<br>
      <br>
      I'm not used to these low power devices. If I fire one of my motor
      coils up on the bench, I get all kinds of metal crap flying
      around.<br>
      <br>
      Anyway, I decided to soak it in salt water and see how it worked
      after that. It currently reads .82 volts at a respectable 85ma.
      I'll dry it out and see if those values hold up.<br>
      <div align="center">***<br>
      </div>
      These things are weird. When I shorted the two ends of the copper
      together and short the two steel ends, the current between the two
      went up to 106ma. Instantaneous current is over 200ma, then it
      drops down to a steady 106.<br>
      <br>
      I couldn't detect any solenoidal pull either. A steel rod
      partially out of the center exhibits no detectable movement when
      the leads are shorted, even when balanced on a very soft spring.
      This indicates little or no net current flow in one direction,
      which would be keeping with two generators (the two wires) pushing
      current in opposite directions. But then how do we get a polarity
      on the steel? A slight imbalance maybe?<br>
      <br>
      I'm not really sure anymore how Laser's motor is running either.
      Perhaps there's some inductance from the spinning magnets that
      dictates polarity? I'll have to think about it.<br>
      <div align="center">***<br>
      </div>
      Continuing along with the weird theme... I shorted all the
      separate windings together, both top and bottom... and the current
      increased. You can see when it's in the vertical position the
      current is around 119ma. When I tipped it over to show the bottom
      shorts, it gave me a few more ma's. <br>
      <br>

      I don't know whether to consider this a battery or a self filling
      capacitor (is there a difference?). I doesn't act like a coil
      though. I'll bet you could get the same results with two sheets of
      metal coiled up like a capacitor with some cotton in between.
      That's essentially what I have here. I may try that next...<br>
      <div align="center">***<br>
      </div>
      I went to check on it this morning and I think it died overnight.
      It read only .2 volts and the current was a paltry 10ma.<br>
      I stuck it outside in the sun to warm it up. Perhaps that will
      revive it. Maybe it needed a constant load to keep it going?<br>
      We'll see if the patient revives in a couple of hours. <br>
      <div align="center">***<br>
      </div>
      I think I read somewhere that the copper has to be corroded. If
      so, you'd need to use bare copper wire and swab it with copper
      sulfate. You can get this 'antiquing' solution, which is called
      Copper Patina, at a stained glass store. <br>
      <div align="center">***<br>
      </div>
      Thanks for the info. I'm using bare wire and I dipped it in salt
      water, so that's a start.<br>
      I did find a short and managed to isolate that section. The
      voltage is back up to .49 volts, but it's still nothing to write
      home about. I think you would have to make a really big coil for
      it to do much.<br>
      I really should get back to my sammich motor but I've lost the
      momentum. I need to find some inspiration somewhere. 10 hours more
      work will see it running, but I can't seem to kindle the spark.<br>
      I even cleaned the shop...<br>

      We do not know the secret of the earth charge as Nathan
      Stubblefield determined it. Others since his time have observed
      fluctuations at certain times of the year in ground energy. It may
      be that a sudden induction is required before the excess ground
      charge surges&nbsp; to the surface..... like priming a pump.<br>
      <br>
      So I did some experiments in building different types of cells. I
      used a 10 inch carriage bolt 3/4 inch diameter between two delron
      spacers. I used steel wire and copper wire that was coated. I
      would wind one layer and sand it off, check for shorts,&nbsp; and
      then wrap it with gauze and start the next winding. I then put the
      secondary induction coil windings on.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="overunity.jpg" height="775"
          width="464"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      These are the results I got in a one gallon plastic jug filled
      with water. Volts .07,&nbsp; 250ma into dead short through meter
      shunt. I'm still working on a better cell to go into the ground at
      this time.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield published an extraordinary brochure in 1898 to
      attract investors who had expressed interest in consolidating a
      small corporation around his work. In this brochure, Stubblefield
      insisted that power for his device was not generated in the cell.
      He calmly stated that the cell received its surplus energy from
      the earth. In a less discussed portion of the brochure,
      Stubblefield stated that "electrotherapeutic" devices had been
      developed from his earth battery. Other researchers made similar
      claims for their earth batteries (Hicks, Mellon). During this
      time, Stubblefield declared that news, weather, and other
      announcements could be broadcast through the ground across a great
      territory for private reception. He also added that simultaneous
      messages and news of all kinds would soon be transmitted through
      the ground from a central distribution station. (Shades of Tesla!)<br>
      <br>
      In 1902 Stubblefield set up one of his sets in a "Mainstreet"
      upper office... in a hardware shop. From that point to his farm
      (some 6000 feet distant) he conducted continuous conversations
      with his son Bernard. Tapping with a pencil on his one-piece
      transceiver, Bernard was quickly heard in a loud, very clear
      voice. This transceiver was a carbon button placed in a tin snuff
      box. Speech and response were transacted through the same device,
      which acted as both microphone and loudspeaker. Cells (EARTH
      BATTERIES) were placed downstairs from the office in the ground.
      They were never removed and never wore out, though operating
      twenty-four hours a day around the clock.<br>
      <br>
      Nathan Stubblefield offered to construct a large scale power
      station for the town of Murray. His quoted initial installation
      costs were estimated at five thousand dollars. The town
      politicians declined the offer. As a result, the&nbsp; technique
      of drawing up electricity from the earth remains a mystery.<br>
      <br>
      The Stubblefield ground radio system was demonstrated for
      approximately one thousand Murray residents. Photographs of
      Stubblefield and his family, and a good crowd of witnesses from
      town, show the cell laying on the ground among all his assembled
      inventions; and a flower-pot sized coil of good volume. Other
      devices show motors and large capacitor stacks for aerial voice
      transmission experiments.<br>
      <br>
      Stubblefield declares it to be an "energy receiver....a receptive
      cell for intercepting electrical ground waves". Its conductive
      ability somehow absorbs and directs the enormous volumes of earth
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      Whether the current derived from this cell is electricity as we
      know it has been questioned. One indicator is not found when
      considering his use of the energy in lighting lamps. With this
      energy Nathan Stubblefield operated a score of arc lamps at full
      brightness for twenty-four hours a day. There was a definite
      trigger by which this energy was stimulated and maintained.<br>
      <br>
      The induction coil which bears his name is equipped with three
      coils which are wrapped around and upon a heavy iron core. Bare
      iron wire and cotton-covered copper wire are wrapped side by side,
      comprising a primary coil body. Each layer of the primary
      coil&nbsp; body is covered by a band of cotton insulation,
      bringing four wire leads to the coil terminus. Two leads of iron
      and two of copper are external to the coil. Commercial electrical
      power is obtained through these connective terminals.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to this bimetallic winding, there is a third winding:
      the "secondary". This third coil is insulated from the primary
      bimetallic coil, serving as a trigger device. Presumably, a
      stimulating impulse shock was introduced into the tertiary coil,
      after which the upwelling electrical ground response brought forth
      powerful currents in both iron and copper coils.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolytically (as a battery in acid or saltwater) the
      Stubblefield coil is disappointing, producing less then one volt
      according to those who have duplicated its construction.
      Stubblefield's bimetallic coil was a "plug": a receiver which
      intercepts the vast and free electrical reservoir of the ground
      itself. His patent and subsequent company brochures define the
      manner in which his earth battery was to be activated.<br>
      <br>
      Technically, the Stubblefield device is a modified thermocouple (a
      bimetal in tight surface contact) but a thermocouple could not
      supply the degree of&nbsp; power which he reported. While this
      arrangement could develop a few milliwatts of power in
      appropriately hot ground spots, the thermoelectric explanation of
      the device cannot explain the phenomenal output reported in the
      news reports of Stubblefield's demonstrations.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, though the Stubblefield power receiver is wound like
      an induction coil, it produces a steady direct current output.
      This poses additional problems for the conventional engineer.
      Electrical induction only occurs with electrical alternations,
      oscillations, and impulses.<br>

      January 1, 1902<br>
      <br>
      Witnesses describe ground-powered motors which ran unceasingly and
      unattended for months without need for replacing or replenishing
      the ground battery. Small machinery, clocks, and loud gongs were
      run by other ground-buried cells as reported by credible
      witnesses. Stubblefield may have discovered the auto-magnifying
      voltage effect of electrostatic induction in coils before
      Tesla,&nbsp; who later utilized the effect in his special
      electrostatic Transformers.<br>
      <br>
      These buried coils may have become saturated with earth
      electrostatic energy, which travelled from subterranean depths. In
      such a case, the mere battery power of the coil was replaced by
      the electrostatic flow, the coil acting as an electrode. This
      seems obvious when considering the fact that its ordinary battery
      current (1 watt) was gradually replaced by continually growing
      electrical current of far greater proportion.<br>
