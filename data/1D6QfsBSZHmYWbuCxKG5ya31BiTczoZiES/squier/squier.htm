            <p>With a pair of receives to his ears, an amazed visitor to
              a certain radio station heard a high-toned hum which
              changed to a low growl, then skied to the upper reaches of
              the musical scale in a</p>
          </font></font></font> faint, very faint buzz, as if some
      microscopic mosquito had had his song made audible. The operator
      rapidly rapidly turning the knobs on his couplers and condensers,
      raised his hand: suddenly, through the changing radio signals
      which were clamoring for attention together in the receivers came
      his voice; "There --- the loud, easily heard one is New Brunswick;
      the fainter, lower one is Nauen, in Germany".
      <p>If all this had taken place in the great Arlington station one
        would not have wondered, save perhaps at the inability to tune
        out all radio but Nauen. But it was a little portable house
        erected in thick woods near the edge of the District of Columbia
        and the signals were received through an oak tree for an
        antenna. </p>
      <p>It is not a joke nor a scientific curiosity, this strange
        discovery of Gen. George O. Squire, Chief Signal Officer, that
        trees --- all trees, of all kinds and all heights, growing
        anywhere --- are nature's own wireless towers and antenna
        combined. The matter first came to his attention in 1904,
        through the use of trees as grounds for Army buzzer and
        telegraph and telephone sets, which, in perfectly dry ground and
        in a dry season, functioned poorly or not at all with ordinary
        grounds. Right then he began experiments with a view to seeing
        what possibilities, if any, the tree had as an aerial. But in
        1904 radiotelegraphy was far more undeveloped than at present,
        and vacuum amplifying tubes were not thought of. </p>
      <p>During the war the Signal Corps established a chain of special
        receiving stations in different localities to copy and record
        enemy and allied radio messages. Some of those stations were
        instructed to test the efficiency of growing trees as receiving
        antennae. </p>
      <p>With the remarkably sensitive amplifiers now available, it was
        not only possible to receive signals from all the principle
        European stations through a tree, but it has developed beyond a
        theory and to a fact that a tree is as good as any man-made
        aerial, regardless of the size or extent of the latter, and
        better in the respect that it brings to the operator's ears far
        less static interference. </p>
      <p>This is a rather broad statement, yet there beyond the Capital
        of the nation stands a little portable house, the oak tree, a
        small receiving set and a couple of enlisted men and an officer
        on duty; and the curious may, with permission, hear for
        themselves that the signals so received are neither faint not
        interrupted, but strong, full-toned dots and sashes even when
        they come from far-off Nauen. Page after page is copied daily
        from the propaganda material which Nauen sends out by the ream.
        Lyons, Poldhu, ships at sea, even the NC-4 on her way, are heard
        plainly. As for New Brunswick or nearby Arlington --- they
        deafen the listener if he is unwise enough to try to "take" them
        otherwise than with the phones lying on the tables. </p>
      <p>It will puzzle the amateur as it has puzzled the experts, how a
        tree, which is certainly well grounded, can also be an insulated
        aerial. The method of getting the disturbances in potential from
        treetop to instrument is so simple as to be almost laughable.
        One climbs a tree to two-thirds of its height, drives a nail a
        couple of inches into the tree, hangs a wire therefrom, and
        attaches the wire to the receiving apparatus as if it were a
        regular lead-in from a lofty copper or aluminum aerial.
        Apparently some of the etheric disturbances passing from treetop
        to ground through the tree are diverted through the wire --- and
        the thermionic tube most efficiently does the rest. </p>
      <p>It is interesting to learn that the tree behaves very much like
        any other aerial; it receives better in dry clear weather than
        in muggy, damp weather. It plucks messages from the ether more
        clearly at night than in the day. It is affected very little by
        rain. It is affected not at all by the presence of other trees;
        so far as has yet been ascertained it makes little difference
        whether one drives his nail in a tree in the forest or a lone
        tree on the plain. Certainly it makes no difference that amounts
        to anything whether the tree be just an ordinary tree or a
        giant; it was a 60-foot oak over which the very awe-struck
        correspondent heard Nauen telling a waiting world what good
        people the Germans really are. And to prove that it made no
        particular difference what kind of tree was used the officer in
        charge switched to a pine tree, which received equally well. </p>
      <p>A dead tree will not do, and a tree not in leaf is not so
        sensitive as one in full foliage. It makes much difference where
        the nail is driven. General Squier calls the proper place the
        optimum point, and experimentally it has been determined that
        two-thirds of the distance from ground to top is the best place
        -- in a 60-foot tree, 40 feet from the ground. </p>
      <p>One nail is sufficient, and it may be any kind of nail; but
        copper is preferred as not rusting. In practice, if a tree
        station is to be at all permanent, several nails would be driven
        and connected to the same wire, each additional nail up to 6 or
        8 making the diverted current a little stronger. But 40 nails
        apparently produce no clearer signals than half a dozen. </p>
      <p>The tree may serve as a receiving station for several sets,
        either connected in series with the same material or from
        separate terminals. </p>
      <p>Some skeptics have expressed the belief that it was not the
        tree, but the wire leading to the nail in the tree which was the
        real aerial. The absurdity of thinking a 40-foot wire could
        receive the widely differing wave lengths which come through the
        tree station is obvious, but to set any doubt at rest, the wire
        to the tree has been hung to the nail by means of an insulator,
        when the signals immediately cease, only to come in as strong as
        ever just as soon as the connection is again established. </p>
      <p>Just what will the tree do as a transmitting station for radio
        telegraphic messages has not been determined in the Signal Corps
        Experimental Laboratory. As those in charge express it, "The
        fact has been demonstrated, but the matter is still in
        laboratory stage only. What remains to be done now is to develop
        the best methods of using the demonstrated fact". </p>
      <p>But it has already been shown that the tree can be used in
        wireless telephony and for short distances it has been shown
        that two-way telephonic communications is easily established
        through trees with remarkably low values of transmitting antenna
        current. </p>
      <p>If a tree may be used to send wireless telephonic waves it
        seems not unreasonable to suppose that it will do so as easily
        with the telegraphic waves. At present the Signal Corps is at
        work on apparatus to test the possibilities of the tree as a
        transmitting station. </p>
      <p>Just what this development of the art of radio telegraphy may
        mean has not yet been worked out. It is the history of most
        discoveries that their potentialities are hardly dreamed of when
        they are first made --- for instance the telephone, the
        electromagnet, the vacuum tube amplifier. But it seems fairly
        obvious that in war, at least, the tree receiving station opens
        up great possibilities. </p>
      <p>True enough there are few trees which remain intact under shell
        fire, and doubtless with this possibility in mind the armies of
        the future (if there be such) will in action consider all trees
        as dangerous enemy aerial stations. But there will always be
        trees behind the lines and not all actions will be fought on
        bare ground. What would it have meant to the "lost battalion" to
        have had a tree wireless set along by which it could have heard
        that every effort was being made to find and relieve it, or by
        which it might have sent back messages supplementing that
        carried by the pigeon? </p>
      <p>The greatest development, however, of the tree as the
        foundation for a receiving and possibly a sending station will
        come in peace uses. General Squier has written: </p>
      <p>"In view of what has been accomplished in space telegraphy, it
        is difficult to predict to what extent this means of
        communication may ultimately be developed. If, as indicated in
        these experiments, the earth's surface is already generously
        provided with efficient antennae, which we have but to utilize
        for such communication, even over short distances, it is a
        fascinating thought to dwell upon in connection with the future
        development of the transmission of intelligence. </p>
      <p>"Since a transmitting station is a central point for
        electromagnetc waves sent out in all directions over the surface
        of the earth, a large class of information, such as
        meteorological reports, crop reports, and general news items of
        interest to all, may in time be sent from central points, to be
        received in many places within the radius of influence of the
        signal station, and this, too, by the simplest form of
        apparatus." </p>
      <p>The amateur wireless world will unquestionably take an intense
        interest in the tree radio work. At present, while the
        government has lifted the ban upon amateur aerials, it has not
        removed the structures against sending. </p>
      <p>The aerial is always the greatest problem for the amateur. Lack
        of both money and material prevents him from erecting anything
        very large or of very great capacity. If any lad with a
        receiving set and some thermionic tubes can hook to a tree and
        take in any wavelength he can tune to, will not tree radio
        vastly increase the devotees of this particular variety of
        indoor sport? The matter is one of some importance, inasmuch as
        many valuable recruits to the radio world have come from amateur
        ranks, and many a radio engineer had got his first taste for the
        fascinating art through a homemade tuning coil and detector,
        under the attic roof. The greater the amateur wireless world,
        the quicker the development of the art as a whole. </p>
      <p>Explorers, discoverers, engineers in far places, the forest
        service, the woodsman, all have use for the new development.
        Moreover the tree as an antenna offers unusual possibilities for
        the investigation of atmospheric phenomena and for what may be
        called the physics of botany (or the botany of physics) and
        perhaps is the road by which the unsolved puzzle of growth may
        be studied. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is a thought not without great power to move the
        sensitive imagination that every tree, growing everywhere, is a
        wireless tower and antenna and that, as General Squier says, "It
        is significant that a tree, possessing utility and natural
        strength, architectural beauty of design and endurance far
        superior to artificial structures prepared by man, should be
        able yet further to minister to his needs". </p>

      <p>As long ago as 1904, the author conducted some experiments with
        a view to utilizing growing trees as antennae for
        radio-telegraphy and discovered the efficacy, in a general way,
        of using a direct metallic contact to certain trees (principally
        Eucalyptus) to increase the audibility of radio signals. My
        attention was first called to this phenomenon during the course
        of summer maneuvers of the Army at Camp Atascadero, CA, where,
        due to the prevalence of the dry season of the soil, it was
        found that the regular Army buzzer telephone and telegraph sets
        were inoperative with any ordinary ground or earth but became
        operative when connected to a metallic nail driven in the trunk
        or roots of a live tree. This incident led the author to pursue
        the subject experimentally in the autumn of 1904 continuing the
        experiments to the range of frequencies than employed in
        radio-telegraphy. </p>
      <b>
        <p><b>Tree Antennae</b> </p>
      </b>
      <p>In connection with the organization and development of
        Transatlantic radio reception, which was carried out during the
        period of the war to provide against the possibility of the
        interruption of the submarine cable system, the Signal Corps
        established a chain of special receiving stations in different
        parts of the United States to copy and record enemy and Allied
        radio messages from European stations for the information of our
        Army General Staff. </p>
      <p>In the prosecution of this work, directions were given to the
        Signal Corps Laboratory at Camp Alfred Vail, Little Silver, NJ,
        and also to the experimental staff in Washington to test the
        efficiency of growing trees as receiving antenna, in connection
        with this service, using the vastly superior technique and
        facilities now represented in the radio Art as compared with the
        crude apparatus with which the discovery was made in 1904. With
        a collection of apparatus representing the most advanced state
        of the radio Art, the problem, as a war measure, was attacked
        anew and has now reached a point where a very brief outline of
        some of the physical results obtained should be presented in the
        interests of the development of the Art in general. Since the
        phenomena involved embrace a variety of physical problems rather
        than strictly engineering ones, these data are presented in the
        hope that our scientists may see in the experiments some points
        of departure for further research. </p>
      <p>It was immediately discovered that with the sensitive
        amplifiers now in use it was possible to receive signals from
        the principal European stations by simply laying a small wire
        netting on the ground beneath the tree and connecting an
        insulated wire to a nail driven in the tree well within the
        outline of the tree top. See Figure 1. Messages having been
        received from England, France, Germany and Italy. </p>
      <p>This encouraging first result justified a more careful
        examination of the phenomena and the most suitable arrangement
        of circuits for the purpose. </p>
      <b>
        <p><b>And Now For the Floraphone</b> </p>
      </b>
      <p>The messages carried over this tree telephone and telegram
        system have been named by the writer. They are to be
        ‘floragrams’. The tree telephone is to be a ‘floraphone’; the
        tree telegraph a ‘floragraph’. </p>
      <p>The discovery is now announced after experiments covering 15
        years, beginning in California and continuing intermittently
        until the outbreak of the war, when they went forward with vigor
        as an emergency means of communication. The system was utilized
        during the war in listening-in on the German radio
        communication. </p>
      <p>The final development took place in a small portable
        laboratory, purchased from a mail order house, capable of being
        carried to any place in the woods. A group of soldiers, taking
        turns at copying messages, assisted the writer in the
        development of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>Without entering into the details of these preliminary
        experiments here it may be said that one fo the best receiving
        arrangements is found to be an elevated tree earth-terminal in
        the upper part of the tree top, and an earth consisting
        practically of several short pieces of insulated wire, sealed at
        the outer end, radiating out from a common center, and buried a
        few inches beneath the surface of the ground in the neighborhood
        of the tree. See Figure 2. </p>
      <p>It was soon found that a tree-antenna could be used efficiently
        as a multiple radio receiving set over widely different
        wavelengths, see Figure 3A, receiving either from separate
        terminals at the same (shown dotted in Figure 3A) or different
        heights of the tree, or in series from the same terminal. See
        Figure 3B. </p>
      <p>This same type of circuit was employed in an inverse manner for
        radio-telephonic transmitting purposes, although the experiments
        thus far have been limited to short distances. It was found that
        2-way radio-telephonic communication was easily established with
        remarkably low values of transmitting antenna current. See
        diagram of this test illustrated at Figure 4. </p>
      <p>The flexibility of this arrangement is very striking. The
        linking up of wire and wireless methods was found to be both
        convenient and efficient. Radio-telephonic messages from
        airplanes were readily received by the tree-antenna arrangement
        and transferred thence to the wire system of the city of
        Washington and finally received at any point desired. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, radio-telephonic transmission through the
        tree-antenna was received by another tree-antenna, and
        automatically returned to the sender on a wire system, thus
        making a complete circuit. Illustrated at Figure 6. </p>
      <p>Long distance reception on any wave length from all the larger
        European stations and from our ships at sea was easily
        accomplished and traffic copied on a 24 hour schedule by the
        regular enlisted operators of the Signal Corps. A small portable
        house serving as a field laboratory was erected in the midst of
        the forest area on Grant Road, Washington DC, and here was
        assembled a collection of amplifiers from the Army, navy, the
        British and French, and American manufacturers. With these
        facilities it was a matter of a few days to test out, at least
        in a superficial manner, a large number of proposed arrangements
        using trees as antenna. </p>
      <p>Figure 7 shows how a number of trees can be connected up to
        give the effect of one large antenna. </p>
      <p>In France officers of the Signal Corps, by the simple device of
        driving a spike into a tree-trunk to which connect the audion
        set which wireless operators use to make up wireless messages,
        it was found possible to listen in on communications between

        <p><b>The Physics of Tree Wireless</b> </p>
      </b>
      <p>We may regard the metallic electrode rigidly driven into the
        living organism of a tree, as described above, as a potential
        earth-terminal for the study of the potential distribution on
        the surface of the earth itself. It has been shown in these
        experiments that this metallic terminal intimately connected to
        the earth itself and a part thereof is subject to changes of
        potential representing the innumerable frequencies required by
        modern radio-telephony and telegraphy, as well as any other
        electrical disturbances which may occur on the surface of the
        earth or the atmosphere above the earth. </p>
      <p>It has also been shown, as expected, that we can select from
        this composite one or more of the different frequencies by tuned
        electrical loop circuits suitably connected to this electrode
        and study each in turn, at will, just as color screens can
        select a particular component of white light. We may, indeed, by
        means of a highly insulated conductor bring this terminal
        directly to the laboratory and connect it immediately to the
        modern thermionic tube and amplify almost at will the particular
        effects we are studying… </p>
      <p>We can consider that trees have been pieces of electrical
        apparatus from their beginning and with their manifold chains of
        living cells are absorbers, conductors and radiators of the long
        electromagnetic waves as used in the radio Art. </p>
      <p>For our present purpose we may consider, therefore, a growing
        tree as a higly organized piece of living earth, to be used in
        the same manner as we now use the earth as a universal conductor
        for telephony and telegraphy and other electrical purposes… </p>

                Communication Systems</font></b> </p>
          <p><b>George O. Squier</b></p>
        </center>

      <p>This invention relates to radio communication systems. More
        particularly, the invention relates to radio transmission and
        reception through the use of living vegetable organisms such as
        trees, plants, and the like. </p>
      <p>As disclosed in the Specification of my prior Letters Patent
        No. 25,610 (1904), I have discovered heretofore that tall trees
        and like growing vegetation possessed electrical conductivity of
        a certain nature adapted for the reception of signaling
        electromagnetic waves and capable of forming a part of an
        antenna or serial with the use of a direct earth "ground" or
        equivalent point of connection with the tree, in the potential
        node region. </p>
      <p>I have recently discovered that living vegetable organisms
        generally are adapted for transmission and reception of radio or
        high frequency oscillations, whether damped or undamped, with
        the use of a suitable counterpoise. I have further discovered
        that such living organisms are adapted for respectively
        transmitting or receiving a plurality of separate trains of
        radio or high frequency oscillations simultaneously, in the
        communication of either or both telephonic or telegraphic
        messages. </p>
      <p>In such use of an antenna comprising living vegetable organism
        and a counterpoise, I have discovered that optimum results are
        obtained upon arranging the point of connection of the
        transmitting or the receiving set within a certain range of the
        tree, or other living vegetable organism; for trees indigenous
        in the temperate zones, I have discovered that such optimum
        point of connection is in a region approximately two-thirds of
        the height of the tree above the exposed surface of the earth. </p>
      <p>In accordance with my invention for receiving radio trains of
        telephonic or telegraphic high frequency oscillations, a
        plurality of receiving sets attuned respectively to any desired
        frequency, may be connected by the same leading-in wire to the
        same tree, whereby such tree serves as the common receiving
        antenna for the respective individual receiving sets; and,
        similarly, for transmitting radio trains of telephonic or
        telegraphic high frequency oscillations, a plurality of
        transmitting sets respectively resonant to any desired frequency
        may be connected by a common lead-in wire to the same tree
        serving as the common antenna. </p>
      <p>In the more preferred forms of my invention, I have devised
        suitable means for selective directional reception of radio
        oscillations of any desired definite frequency, by the use of a
        coil having the turns of its windings disposed in substantial
        parallelism and mounted to be rotated in a horizontal plane,
        whereby the received oscillations are restricted to the
        direction coincident with or parallel to a plane lying normal to
        any plane passing through any turn of the windings of the coil.
      </p>
      <p>The counterpoise comprises preferably a suitable extent of
        conductor in the form of one or more lengths of wire disposed
        below the surface of the earth and suitable insulated therefrom;
        it is desirable to arrange a number of individual counterpoises,
        each extending rectilinearly in different directions to one
        another and to employ in directional selection the particular
        counterpoise extending substantially in the selected direction.
      </p>
      <p>Further features and objects of the invention will be more
        fully understood from the following description and the
        accompanying drawings, in which: </p>

      <p>Referring to Figure 1, the circuit designated 1 represents any
        approved form of resonant receiving circuit comprising the
        variable condenser 2, and detector, rectifier or amplifier 3,
        arranged with a telephone or any suitable recording device in
        the usual manner. Such attuned receiving circuit 1 is suitably
        coupled through transformer windings or otherwise with proper
        regulatable reactance with the tree or other living vegetable
        organism and in Figure 1 I have indicated the location 4 as
        representing the location of a metallic nail, or equivalent,
        affixed to and extending within the body of such tree. I have
        discovered that optimum results for any particular tree are
        dependent upon the physical contour of the space occupied by the
        branches and leaves as well as the subterranean portions of the
        tree such as the roots and that generally the optimum results
        are attained by affixing the nail 4 within the region of the
        tree substantially two-thirds of the height of the tree above
        the surface of the earth. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>To such nail 4 is connected one end of the lead-in wire 5,
        preferably enclosed in suitable insulation, and connected at its
        other end with the resonant circuit 6 comprising the adjustable
        inductance coil 7 and the adjustable condenser 8. The lead 9
        connects the circuit 6 with the counterpoise 10, preferably
        comprising one or more metallic wires, 11, extending
        substantially rectilinearly and electrically insulated from the
        earth 12 by means of suitable insulation 13, as by enclosing
        such wire or wires 11 within a suitable insulating coating. Such
        coating 13 extends preferably an appreciable distance above the
        surface 14 of the earth 12. In the use of my invention with
        living antennae, I have arranged the counterpoise 10-13
        extending in the rectilinear direction substantially parallel to
        the plane passing through the transmitting station, the
        receiving station and the center of the earth. It is
        advantageous to arrange a plurality of individual counterpoises
        10 radiating in different rectilinear directions, with a
        suitable switching device for connecting the lead 9 with the
        particular counterpoise parallel to or most closely parallel to
        the selected direction. </p>
      <p>Such coil 7 is preferably a primary coil suitably spacially
        coupled with an adjustable secondary coil 15 connected in the
        circuit comprising the variable condenser 2 and 3. In the
        specific form of the invention shown in Figure 1, such secondary
        coil 15 is provided with the lead wire 16 connected to the
        terminal 17 of the reversing switch 18 (shown diagrammatically)
        the other end of the secondary coil 15 being connected by the
        cross wire 20 of the reversing switch 18. Such terminal 17 is
        connected by the cross wire 21 with the terminal 24. The pivoted
        knife blades 25, 26, having the handle 27, are mounted in the
        usual manner on the central terminals 28, 29. The coil 30
        represents diagrammatically a coil comprising a desired number
        of windings or successive turns of exposed or insulation covered
        wire, each turn lying substantially in a common vertical plane
        and the coil indicated at 31 represents a similar plurality of
        turns of windings mounted in substantially a common vertical
        plane. One terminal of the coil 30 is connected with one of the
        central terminals of the reversing switch 18, say terminal 28,
        and one terminal of the coil 31 is connected with the other
        central terminal 29, of the reversing switch 18. The other
        terminal of the coil 30 is connected by the wire 32 with the
        leads of the variable condenser 2 in shunt with the detector or
        amplifier 3, while the other terminal of the coil 31 is
        connected by the wire 33 to the opposite lead of the variable
        condenser 2 and the detector or amplifier 3. </p>
      <p>Such set of coils 30, 31 are suitably mounted to be rotated
        horizontally, whereby all turns of the coils 30, 31, at any
        given position lie substantially in a common vertical plane.
        Such coils 30, 31 may be arranged on a common wooden or like
        insulating frame of cylindrical, rectangular or other desired
        contour on cross section. </p>
      <p>By virtue of such an arrangement, the primary and secondary
        circuits are respectively directly exposed to and simultaneously
        electromagnetically acted upon by the incoming oscillations, and
        by means of the reversing switch 18 the oscillations generated
        in the coil 30 may be neutralized or accumulated relatively to
        the oscillation generated in the coil 31 to produce either the
        "barrage" or the "amplifying" effect. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>By means of such "barrage" effect, the oscillations of any
        given wavelength directed in any absolute direction are cut out
        from the detector or amplifying circuit and enable oscillations
        of similar or the same wave length received in any definite
        direction to be conducted to the detector or amplifying circuit.
        By means of such accumulating effect of the coils 30, 31, and
        the switch 18, the waves of any definite wavelength received in
        any definite absolute direction are amplified and enable long
        distance reception at any wave length. </p>
      <p>In practice, I have carried out the invention for reception by
        the use of either a single receiving set or a plurality of
        receiving sets. Such receiving set or sets may be arranged
        either to receive damped high frequency oscillations or undamped
        high frequency oscillations. </p>
      <p>In Figure 2 I have illustrated diagrammatically one form of the
        application of the invention for the simultaneous reception of a
        plurality of different trains of high frequency oscillations. </p>

      <p>The nail 4 is indicated as located in electrical connection
        with the tree 35 at an optimum point 36, the lead-in wire 37
        being connected at its upper end with the nail 4 and at its
        lower end with the incoming connector bar 38. The connector 38
        is provided with the individual switches 39-40-41, etc.,
        corresponding to the number of individual receiving sets. The
        outgoing connector bar 42 is connected by the lead 43 with the
        counterpoise 10, preferably constructed and arranged as set
        forth hereinabove. </p>
      <p>In suitable relation with the incoming connector bar 38 and
        outgoing connector bar 42 and the switches 39, 40, 41 are
        arranged the respective primary coils 44, 45, 46, etc.,
        respectively coupled in any approved arrangement with the
        secondary coils 47, 48, 49. </p>
      <p>The receiving set 50 is arranged for the reception of undamped
        waves and is shown of the vacuum tube valve type. The terminals
        of the secondary 47 are suitably connected in the input circuit
        including the filament cathode 51 of the vacuum valve 52 and the
        grid 53 and comprises the variable condenser 54 in shunt with
        the secondary 47, the condenser 55 and the grid leak resistance
        56. The output circuit comprises the battery 58, the filament
        cathode 51, and the telephone receiver or other audible, or any
        visual indicator 57. The heating circuit of the filament cathode
        includes the battery 60 and the variable resistance 61. </p>
      <p>The receiving set 62 is shown of a similar undamped oscillation
        receiving type and like elements are designated by like
        reference numbers. </p>
      <p>The receiving set 63 is indicated of the damped oscillation
        receiving type and comprises the additional inductance turns 64
        having one terminal connected to one terminal of the filament
        cathode 51 and its other terminal connected to the variable
        condenser 65 in shunt with the telephone receiver 57 and the
        storage battery 58. The remaining elements of the receiving set
        63 correspond to like elements of the receiving set 50 and are
        designated by like reference numbers. </p>
      <p>In Figure 2 I have shown the switch 39 in closed position with
        the primary inductance 44 of the receiving set 50, the switch 40
        in closed position with the primary inductance 45 of the
        receiving set 63 and the switch 41 in open position with the
        primary inductance 46 of the receiving set 62, and accordingly
        enabling the reception and detection of undamped oscillations of
        the frequency to which the receiving set 50 is tuned and
        simultaneously the reception and detection of damped
        oscillations of the frequency to which the receiving set 53 is
        tuned. </p>
      <p>Figure 3 shows one form of practical application of my
        invention for transmitting simultaneously radio oscillations,
        either telephonic or telegraphic, either damped or undamped, or
        both. The nail 4, lodged at an optimum point 36 in the tree 35,
        is connected by the lead 70 to the connector bar 71, and the
        counterpoise 10 is connected by the lead 72 to the connector bar
        73. </p>
      <p>The transmitting sets 74, 75, etc., of the desired number, are
        suitably arranged for single or multiple transmission, for which
        purpose the switches 76, 77, etc., are provided. The
        transmitting sets 74, 75 are shown of any approved type, such as
        the oscillating vacuum tube type comprising the filament cathode
        78, the grid 79 and anode 80, arranged in the vacuum tube 81,
        suitably connected with the primary inductance 84, 85. The
        primary inductances 84, 85 are suitably connected to the
        connector bar 73 and the connector bar 71 through the respective
        switches 76, 77. The battery or other source of electric current
        is indicated at 86. The adjustable heating circuit of the
        cathode filament 79 is shown comprising the battery 87 and the
        variable resistance 88. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>In Figure 3, the switch 77 is in closed position thus placing
        the transmitting set 75 in operative connection with the tree
        serving as the antenna. Upon closing the switch 76 the
        transmitting set 74 is similarly placed in operative connection
        with the tree antenna 35. Upon closure of both switches 76, 77
        the tree serves as the antenna for the transmission of
        simultaneous trains of oscillations emitted by the respective
        transmitting sets 74, 75, modified by a key or telephone
        transmitter, or other suitable modulator, for the transmission
        of telegraphic or telephonic messages as desired. </p>
      <p>In the use of trees or other living vegetable organisms serving
        as the antenna or a art thereof, I have discovered from tests
        that such tree possess impedance consisting of two components,
        resistance and reactance, the latter being usually condensive,
        for oscillation within the range of present day wavelengths. The
        tests also show that the apparent capacity of a tree serving as
        an antenna is substantially proportional to the height of
        contact of the lead wire connecting the transmission set with
        the tree. </p>
      <p>The tests also show that the apparent resistance of a tree
        serving as an antenna is appreciably greater than the resistance
        of the ordinary metallic antenna, and it is accordingly
        desirable to modify the resistance or alter the design of the
        receivers, if it desired to increase the effectiveness of the
        energy of the electromagnetic radiation impinging on the tree;
        however, the ordinary receivers of present design may be used
        and are responsive to any wave length of radiation employed in
        present day practice. </p>
      <p>Whereas I have described my invention by reference to specific
        forms thereof, it will be understood that many changes and
        modifications may be made without departing from the spirit of
        the invention as defined by the appended claims. </p>
      An alternative electric power generating system that draws energy
      from a seemingly unlikely yet abundant, eminently renewable and
      virtually free power source has been submitted for patenting by
      MagCap Engineering, LLC, Canton, Mass., in collaboration with
      Gordon W. Wadle, an inventor from Thomson, Ill. Wadle has invented
      a way to capture the energy generated by a living non- animal
      organism --- such as a tree. <br>

          <p><b><font size="+1">"Unlimited Electric Energy from the
                Environment?"</font></b></p>
        </center>
      </b>
      <p>Chris Lagadinos, president of MagCap, developed circuitry that
        converts this natural energy source into useable DC power
        capable of sustaining a continuous current to charge and
        maintain a battery at full charge. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>"As unbelievable as it sounds, we've been able to demonstrate
        the feasibility of generating electricity in this manner," said
        Wadle. </p>
      <p>"While the development is in its infancy, it has the potential
        to provide an unlimited supply of constant, clean energy without
        relying on fossil fuels, a power generating plant complex or an
        elaborate transmission network." </p>
      <p>Wadle likened the invention to the discovery of electricity
        over 200 years ago when charged particles were harnessed to
        create an electric current. "Now we've learned that there is an
        immense, inexhaustible source of energy literally all around us
        that can be harnessed and converted into usable electric power,"
        he said. Ultimately, it should prove to be more practical than
        solar energy or wind power, and certainly more affordable than
        fuel cells, he added. </p>
      <p>Wadle said he got the original idea of harnessing a tree for
        electrical energy from studying lightening, more than 50 percent
        of which originates from the ground. This prompted him to
        develop the theories resulting in a method to access this power
        source. </p>
      <p>Lagadinos then designed circuitry that filtered and amplified
        these energy emanations, creating a useable power source. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>Basically, the existing system includes a metal rod embedded in
        the tree, a grounding rod driven into the ground, and the
        connecting circuitry, which filters and boosts the power output
        sufficient to charge a battery. </p>
      <p>In its current experimental configuration, the demonstration
        system produces 2.1 volts, enough to continuously maintain a
        full charge in a nickel cadmium battery attached to an LED
        light. "Think of the environment as a battery, in this case,"
        said Lagadinos, "with the tree as the positive pole and the
        grounding rod as the negative." </p>
      <p>Lagadinos said the system could be enhanced enough to generate
        12 volts and one amp of power, "a desirable power level that
        could be used to power just about anything," he said. It is
        enough power to charge batteries for any type of vehicle,
        including hybrids and electric cars, or to use with an AC
        converter to produce household power, he added. The LED industry
        is a prime example of a potential user of this power source. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>While the basic concept of this invention -- using a tree to
        generate electric power -- seems too incredible to be true,
        Lagadinos said it can be demonstrated quite simply. "Simply
        drive an aluminum roofing nail through the bark and into the
        wood of a tree -- any tree -- approximately one half inch; drive
        a copper water pipe six or seven inches into the ground, then
        get a standard off-the-shelf digital volt meter and attach one
        probe to the pipe, the other to the nail and you'll get a
        reading of anywhere from 0.8 to 1.2 volts of DC power," he said.

      <p>"You can't do anything with it in that form because it is
        'dirty' -- i.e. highly unstable and too weak to power anything,"
        he added. In order to properly harness this potential energy
        source, MagCap devised two test circuits: one with three
        capacitors that were connected in parallel by means of a switch
        and charged to 0.7 volts each. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>When fully charged they are switched to a series mode,
        multiplying the voltage to 2.1 volts and flashing an LED to show
        that sufficient power could be generated to produce a useable
        result. The second circuit included a filtering device to
        stabilize and "clean" the current so it could be used to charge
        and maintain a NiCad battery. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>The battery then could be connected to the LED to keep the LED
        lit continuously. Wadle pointed out that there seems to be no
        limit to the amount of power that can be drawn from an
        individual tree, no matter how many "taps" are inserted -- each
        produces the same amount of energy, an average of 0.7 - 0.8
        volts. Size of the tree also seems not to matter. </p>
      <p>Interestingly, while conventional wisdom would seem to indicate
        that the tree draws much of its energy from photosynthesis via
        its leaves, the voltage output actually increases to 1.2-1.3
        volts in the winter after the leaves have fallen. </p>
