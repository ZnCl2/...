        <p><b>Treating cancer by ultra high frequency waves.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Cancer - Three features uniquely define cancer. </p>
      <p>1 - It grows exponentially. That means every cell is dividing
        all the time. One cancer cell divides into two, then into four,
        then into eight, 16, 32 etc etc. <br>
        2 - It is irreversible. <br>
        3 - It passes on these traits from generation to generation. </p>
      <p><b>Glucose</b> </p>
      <p>This sugar is used for three purposes. Firstly it provides
        energy from converting glucose into lactic acid for cancer cells
        to divide, without using oxygen. Secondly glucose uses oxygen
        and provides all the energy for your brain to function. Thirdly
        glucose with oxygen controls normal cell division. Cancer is a
        fault in this control which makes it cancerous. </p>
      <p><b>434 MHz Ultra High Frequency Radiowaves</b> </p>
      <p>I discovered in 1973 that this frequency (used throughout the
        continent of Europe as the standard frequency for medical
        purposes) will temporarily activate cancer's burning of glucose
        without oxygen for between 20 and 30 minutes. Millions of
        patients throughout Europe have been treated since 1948 with
        this frequency for stimulating the repair of injuries,
        fractures, wound healing etc without any side effects being
        discovered. It stimulates normal cell division which is self
        limiting when repair is complete. </p>
      <p>If the cancer cells' uptake of glucose from the blood can be
        blocked before applying UHF radiation the cancer cell will die.
        This is selective killing because it ONLY acts on the Glucose to
        Lactic Acid system. </p>
      <p><b>The Treatment Method</b> </p>
      <p>Intravenous injection of glucose blocking agents immediately
        before UHF are essential and have to be given quickly through a
        vein or an intravenous line. The blocking agents consist of
        cystine and oxidised glutathione and other similar forms of
        amino acids in their fully oxidised state. They carry a lot of
        oxygen with them, they look like glucose to the cancer cell and
        are therefore rapidly absorbed by them immediately the UHF
        radiation commences. The glucose is “burnt” by the blocking
        agent's oxygen and the cancer cell dies. </p>
      <p>Large arm veins are the most suitable site for injection. The
        smaller veins of the hand are unsuitable. The injection is
        slightly irritant and is approximately 50 ml of fluid. Before
        treatment starts a PICC line (Per Intravenous Cutaneous
        Catheter) can be inserted if the patient has poor veins. The
        line is inserted by a radiologist using ultrasound placement
        into a deep vein in the upper arm and can only be done in Perth
        if the patient has private health insurance. At the end of
        treatment the PICC line can be easily removed. </p>
      <p>Results have come from 15 treatments over three weeks, Monday
        to Friday - 15 working days (remember WA's public holidays!). </p>
      <p>The infusion of the glucose blocking agent takes approximately
        fifteen minutes and is immediately followed by 20 to 25 minutes
        of UHF therapy using the radiowave machine to part or all of the
        body. </p>
      <p><b>Complications of Treatment</b> </p>
      <p>434 MHz UHF creates resonance (it shakes cancer cells like a
        bell) and fluorescence (the cancer re-radiates different
        frequencies) and the energy does create some heat in the normal
        cells similar to sitting in front of a large electric fire. It
        must be emphasised that this is not heat treatment and MUST NOT
        be called hyperthermia where the body is deliberately raised to
        41.8°C by non electrical methods. After treatment half an hour's
        rest on a relaxing chair/bed under a fan allows the patient to
        drive their car away if they wish. </p>
      <p><b>Side Effects</b> </p>
      <p>Every patient has their haematology, biochemistry and proof of
        cancer levels etc estimated before and after treatment. The only
        contraindication to treatment is a rare disease called
        thalassaemia because the red blood corpuscles in this disease
        (there are a few lesser variants which also may cause trouble)
        are readily damaged by mild warming (body temperature never
        exceeds 39.5°C, upper limit of human tolerance is 41.8°C) and
        the patients become anaemic. This may need fairly urgent
        transfusion if it occurs. </p>
      <p>Approximately 1% or 2% of patients slight symptoms of the brain
        being starved of glucose may occur. The cancer obtains its
        glucose supply using the amino acid cysteine but the brain
        extracts its glucose using the amino acid methionine. This rare
        complication can be completely avoided by eating 100 to 200
        grams of cooked red meat five times a week. If you are not
        willing to eat red meat during treatment there is 1 in 50 chance
        that you will experience these side effects and require
        admission to hospital. Patients must understand that if they do
        not eat red meat that treatment is at their own risk and that
        they must bear all consequences thereof. </p>
      <p>No patient will be treated who is taking any antioxidant other
        than that which is contained in a normal, simple diet. For
        example large doses of Vitamin A, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, selenium
        and multiple other so-called anti-cancer antioxidants may result
        in ineffective treatment simply because these substances destroy
        the glucose blocking agents before they reach the cancer cell. </p>
      <p><b>General Features for Successful Treatment</b> </p>
      <p>A: The smaller the individual lesions the better the result
        because as cancer masses become bigger so the blood supply to
        the centre decreases and the drug cannot penetrate there. <br>
        B: The total mass of cancer is important. Any estimated load in
        excess of 100 grams will probably require more than one session
        of treatment. </p>
      <p><b>The Practical Regime</b> </p>
      <p>I treat every patient whom I consider have a chance of response
        with 15 days of treatment. Then wait six to eight weeks and
        reassess the situation. If there is significant improvement -
        decrease by 10-20% of the cancer mass - then retreatment should
        be carried out because cure is possible in such patients. The
        maximum number of treatment courses given was seven in a patient
        with mesothelioma treated twelve years ago who now is alive and
        well without evidence of the disease. </p>
      <p><b>Specific Contraindications to Treatment</b> </p>
      <p>1. A major contraindication to UHF therapy is having had any
        form of chemotherapy (also called cytotoxics, or cytotoxic
        treatment). These drugs are non-specific cell poisons designed
        to act against the genetic material in the cell nucleus. They do
        not act specifically on the cause of cancer, which is damage in
        the cytoplasm or extra-nuclear part of the cell. Normal cells
        are designed and controlled perfection using genetic
        information. Cancer is caused by irreparable damage to the
        system which interprets our genetic “blueprint”. It is pointless
        to destroy genes when their instructions are ignored by a
        defective system. </p>
      <p>Some cytotoxic drugs may make normal cells more conductive to
        electricity so that there is little electrical difference
        between cancer cells and normal cells and then UHF no longer
        only acts on cancer cells. </p>
      <p>2. Collections of fluid in the chest cavities, heart cavity or
        abdominal cavity must be drained and the cavities dry if
        satisfactory results are to be obtained in the underlying
        cancer. As examples - cancer of the lung and breast can cause
        outpourings of fluid in the left or right pleural space (cavity
        surrounding the lung) and more rarely in the pericardial (heart)
        space. UHF radiation will not penetrate collections of fluid.
        They may become hot enough to increase the damage in the
        cavities. </p>
      <p>Fluid in the peritoneal cavity is called ascites. This is a
        common accompaniment of ovarian cancer and partial blockage to
        the lymphatics draining the abdominal cavity and occasionally
        due to obstruction in the liver from secondary cancer in that
        organ. Ascites may also get worse after UHF treatment and may
        prevent the underlying cancer receiving any effective UHF
        dosage. Ascites, pleural and/or pericardial collections of fluid
        are best treated by aspiration and installation of appropriate
        substances so that the surfaces of the space are inflamed and
        stick together thus obliterating the space. The effusion must
        have been controlled completely by such measures before
        radiowave therapy is possible . </p>
      <p>If patients arrive with collections of fluid and this minor
        operation has to be performed before or during treatment they
        will be referred for drainage by another doctor. Patients
        without private hospital insurance cover with this complication
        will be referred to a public hospital, if so requested. </p>
      <p>3. Smoking is absolutely contraindicated to the treatment.
        Treatment must not be commenced until at least several weeks
        after smoking has ceased. The carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke
        may inactivate the oxygenating effect of the glucose blocking
        agent. </p>
      <p><b>Further Information</b> </p>
      <p>Treatment is given only as out-patient attendance. Stretcher
        patients do not fit within the machine and wheel chair bound
        patients can only be treated if they are fairly mobile. Should
        any problem arise and a public hospital admission is essential,
        not only is Dr Holt unable to supervise you in such an
        institution but UHF therapy cannot be given whilst an in-patient
        in one. </p>
      <p>All hospitals in WA require every interstate patient admitted
        to have a certificate from their local pathologist stating that
        they are free from MRSA (Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus
        Aureus infection). To minimise cross infection in our own rooms
        the results of the MRSA test must be known to us before arriving
        for a course of therapy. </p>
      <p>The treatment centre is in West Perth, an inner suburb with
        free bus travel to the city. Short term rental flats are
        available within a one to five kilometre radius. Your travel
        agent can arrange an hotel to start and then you can find your
        exact needs at leisure. </p>
      <p><b>Costs</b> </p>
      <p>A three week course of treatment is a total of $6550 with a
        Medicare rebate (at 85% of the scheduled fee) of $2206.50 (as at
        1 November 2003). The difference of $4343.50 must be paid during
        the first week of treatment. </p>
      <p>Under the new Safety Net Medicare will now meet 80% of the
        out-of-pocket costs for medical services. Medicare may therefore
        give you a further rebate after the account for treatment has
        been processed by them. </p>
      <p>Always make a claim from your State against your travel costs
        to WA (Patients’ Assisted Travel Scheme/Patient Transport
        Assistance Scheme). These forms are available from your local
        hospital. </p>
      <p>Please note that we do not have the facilities to accept eftpos
        or credit card transactions. Payment can be made via cash or
        cheque. </p>
      <p>If you do not have a referral from your GP or a specialist
        Medicare will not pay their portion of your account. Please
        ensure you bring one with you. </p>

        <p><b>Review of Microwave Cancer Therapy</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Commonwealth Government has today released a review by the
        National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of the
        microwave therapy practiced by Dr John Holt in Western
        Australia. </p>
      <p>The Review Committee on Microwave Cancer Therapy undertook a
        comprehensive assessment of the methods used by Dr Holt,
        including examination of Dr Holt's past and present patient
        records. The committee also examined all published scientific
        evidence on microwave cancer therapy. </p>
      <p>The review committee found no scientific evidence to support
        the use of microwaves in treating cancer, either alone or when
        combined with other therapies. </p>
      <p>The final report on the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of
        microwave cancer therapy concluded that: </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * There is no high-quality published
        scientific evidence which shows superior benefit in terms of
        therapeutic effectiveness for the treatment of cancer with: <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o
        microwave (or UHF) cancer therapy when combined with
        radiotherapy (used by Dr Holt before 1991); or <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o
        microwave cancer therapy when used in combination with glucose
        blocking agents (used by Dr Holt since 1991) <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Microwave cancer therapy in combination
        with radiotherapy was inferior compared to standard conventional
        radiotherapy with respect to disease control and survival for
        patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma or prostate
        cancer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * There was no significant difference in
        survival between conventional radiotherapy and microwave therapy
        used in combination with radiotherapy for patients with head and
        neck, colorectal or bladder cancer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Microwave therapy in combination with
        glucose blocking agents was inferior to radiotherapy in terms of
        symptom control and disease control in patients with bladder or
        any invasive cancer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * There is insufficient information to make a
        reliable assessment of the safety of UHF in combination with
        radiotherapy, or in combination with glucose blocking agents for
        the treatment of patients with cancer. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Conventional radiotherapy had better
        symptom control rates in bladder cancer patients, than UHF in
        combination with radiotherapy or in combination with glucose
        blocking agents. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * UHF in combination with glucose blocking
        agents appeared to have a lower rate of toxicity than UHF in
        combination with radiotherapy, or conventional radiotherapy. </p>
      <p>It is important that every effort is made to ensure cancer
        patients continue to have access to proven effective cancer
        therapies. </p>
      <p>It is important that patients have access to accurate
        information about benefits and risks of treatment for cancer and
        other diseases so they can make fully informed decisions. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Review of Dr Holt's Microwave Cancer
              Therapy</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>You may have been following the story of Perth based surgeon Dr
        John Holt, which has caused a great deal of comment and
        controversy in the media. The Cancer Council WA funded a trial
        of a previous version of Dr Holt's therapy in the 1980s (then
        called the Tronado treatment), and found it was no better than
        existing treatments such as conventional radiotherapy. </p>
      <p>As an evidence-based organisation, The Cancer Council NSW is
        interested in developments in cancer treatment that are
        supported by rigorously conducted clinical trials. Following the
        initial report on A Current Affair , The Cancer Council said it
        would welcome an evidence-based review of Dr Holt's revised
        treatment. The Federal Government, under the auspices of the
        National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC),
        subsequently announced a review. </p>
      <p>Visit the NHMRC website to read more about the review
        www.nhmrc.gov.au/advice/microw.htm </p>
      <p>We are keen to hear the results. However, along with cancer
        specialists, treatment centres and organisations across
        Australia, we strongly recommend that cancer patients do not
        stop or postpone their prescribed treatment in the meantime.
        Thanks to advances in cancer treatment over the years, around
        60% of cancer patients are now cured and many proven and
        promising therapies are available. However, what may be an
        effective treatment for one kind of cancer may not be
        appropriate for another, so please ask your doctor before making
        any decision. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">John Holt and the Media</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>John Holt was virtually unknown until Australia's Channel 9 "A
        Current Affair" (ACA) program, hosted by Ray Martin, took up the
        story on 9th August 2004. </p>
      <p>In a series of programs up to 29th September 2005, they
        interviewed a number of his patients with remarkable cases and
        portrayed Dr. Holt as a doctor who had developed a treatment
        that thousands of patients claimed to have worked for them, yet
        the medical establishment was ignoring and even ridiculing this
        treatment. </p>
      <p>After the first such program, the establishment replied in
        newapaper articles criticising the Tronado machine, used by
        Holt, and that their was no scientific evidence to back his
        claims! </p>
      <p>The next program from ACA pointed out that John Holt had not
        used the Tronado machine for 15 years, the establishment had not
        even bothered to find out what he was doing in the past 15
        years, despite repeated requests from hin for scientific studies
        to be carried out. </p>
      <p>As all his requests for such studies had been rejected, how
        could there been any scientific proof of the effectivness of his
        therapy! </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, literally thousands of his patients were lobbying on
        behalf of John Holt with remarkable stories of how his methods
        had helped them. </p>
      <p>Due to the public uproar caused by the series of TV programs,
        the Australian health minister was forced to launch a public
        enquiry looking into Dr. Holt's therapy. Dr. Holt himself
        retired at the end of June 2005. </p>
      <p>On the 29th Sept 2005, the study was released and the report
        basically claimed the therapy was not any better than
        conventional therapies. </p>
      <p>Two of Australia's TV News channels aired their 8-minute
        segments concerning the results of that enquiry into Dr Holt's
        cancer therapy. TV Channel 9's presenter (pro-Dr Holt) Ray
        Martin had Australia's federal Minister for Health as a guest in
        his Newsroom studio to announce the long-awaited findings of the
        12-months long official investigation of Dr Holt's radiowave
        therapy and its results. Presenter Ray Martin again took a
        pro-Dr Holt stand. </p>
      <p>The other TV channel (Channel 7) News report went one step
        further, reporting that the medical council is now calling for
        an official move to shut down the Dr Holt cancer clinic in Perth
        in order to "protect the public and cancer sufferers". </p>
      <p>This is a contest between the allopathic medical cancer
        industry and supporters of Dr Holt's effective and proven
        radio-wave cancer therapy. The Australian National Health and
        Medical Research Council did not find in favour of Dr Holt. As
        would be expected in light of their medical and financial
        politics. </p>
      <p><b>Reaction to the Official Review by Dr. John Holt</b> </p>
      <p>In an interview with Dr. Holt, I asked him about how the
        government committee had assessed his therapy. </p>
      <p>John Holt: They have never assessed it. Nobody has ever seen a
        patient I have treated. The three enquires just setup a
        committee to look at the results, so say, but they never
        bothered with that, they never asked me for the results, they
        never asked me for the figures. </p>
      <p>Question: So they just invented a report? </p>
      <p>John Holt: Yes ... as my wife just pointed out, most of the
        patients I treat are those that failed with every other method
        and I can still get those results. </p>

        <p><b>Fighting Cancer with Radio Waves</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Originally published in Issue 2 2005 </p>
      <p><b>John Holt has retired.&nbsp; Whilst we are told that his
          work has now been taken over by Hugh Tinsley in Ireland</b>,
        we are currently checking whether Hugh Tinsley is following John
        Holt's protocol or whether he has changed it in any way. </p>
      <p>There is no-one else continuing with Holt's work, to our
        knowledge, here or abroad. </p>
      <p>We will update this information as soon as we have any further
        clarification. </p>
      <p><b>Radio Waves</b> </p>
      <p>In November 2004, the Minister for Health and Ageing in
        Australia, Tony Abbott asked the National Health and Medical
        Research Council to review the effectiveness of radio waves as a
        cancer therapy. In particular he asked them to look at the work
        of Dr John Holt, the former head of Western Australia's main
        Cancer Institute. </p>
      <p>The report was due on December 21st. Unfortunately the council
        appointed could not prepare the report on time as it had
        received over 250 submissions from both patients and doctors
        claiming the treatment was a success. </p>
      <p>Quite correctly it wants to review all the claims in detail. </p>
      <p><b>Dr John Holt</b> </p>
      <p>Dr John Holt was born in Bristol some 80 years ago. He is a GP,
        Gynaecologist, Obstetrician, Radiologist, Surgeon, and more. He
        was in charge of Western Australia's Cancer Institute for more
        than a decade, until the late 70's. </p>
      <p>Dr Holt is now 80 and still runs his cancer clinic which is
        fully booked five months in advance. However he plans to retire
        in June 2005 and, as yet, has no-one to succeed him in
        Australia, although a former colleague hopes to set up a
        treatment centre in Ireland. </p>
      <p>On 17th May 2004 Dr John Holt visited the Dublin Institute of
        Technology - Kevin Street, to meet with Dr Hugh Tinsley (GP) and
        Mr Victor Thorne of the School of Electronic and Communications
        Engineering. </p>
      <p>Victor Thorne has been associated with the late Professor
        Douglas Thornes in the use of radio waves as a means of
        producing hypothermia in cancer therapy. This work was carried
        out in Dublin's St Laurence's Hospital - now Beaumont Hospital.
        Hopefully John Holt's work will not end when he retires. </p>
      <p><b>The Treatment?</b> </p>
      <p>"Holt does not claim it works every time, but it is
        non-invasive, inexpensive and the theory behind it is sound" </p>
      <p>In simple terms, Dr Holt gives the patient an injection of
        glucoseblocking agent (glucose is the favourite food of cancer
        cells). He then directs radio waves of a specific frequency into
        the infected area. Usually, the tumour cells liquefy. </p>
      <p>Holt does not claim it works every time, but it is
        non-invasive, inexpensive and the theory behind it is sound. <br>
        The Science? </p>
      <p>Cancer cells feed on glucose, and without the involvement of
        any oxygen, produce lactic acid. This is broken down in the
        liver to form glucose, which recycles and feeds the cancer cell.
        The cancer has thus taken over the parent, host organism. </p>
      <p>When glucose is present with oxygen in a normal cell, it
        stimulates normal cell division. Not so with a cancer cell which
        thrives without oxygen. </p>
      <p>If the glucose can be cut off from the cancer cell, the only
        remaining glucose will be that inside the cancer cell. </p>
      <p>In 1973 Holt discovered that Ultra High Frequency Radio waves
        (at 434 MHz) were used throughout Europe to stimulate repair,
        wound healing and fracture healing. They also stimulate normal
        cell division in the presence of oxygen. </p>
      <p>Holt thus reasoned that by using sound waves of this frequency
        on the infected area, the normal cells would merely divide while
        the cancer cells would die if they could be starved of glucose.
      </p>
      <p><b>Therapy method</b> </p>
      <p>"The treatment period is three weeks, five days per week" </p>
      <p>An intravenous injection of glucose blocking agents is given
        quickly through a vein or intravenous line. The blocking agents
        used are cystine and oxidised glutathione plus other similar
        amifno acids in their fully oxdised state. The cancer cell is
        'fooled' into absorbing them rather than oxygen. The UHF
        radiation encourages their uptake, the glucose is used up or
        'burnt' by the blocking agent's oxygen and the cancer cell dies.
      </p>
      <p>The treatment period is three weeks, five days per week and the
        infusion of blocking agent takes 15 minutes followed immediately
        by 20-25 minutes of UHF therapy using a radio wave machine
        directed at the infected area or to the whole body. </p>
      <p><b>Side effects and complications</b> </p>
      <p>UHF causes resonance in cancer cells and this produces heat.
        The cancer cells re-radiate this heat (fluorescence) and even
        normal cells can heat up. This can cause a little discomfort. </p>
      <p>The only other side effect is that people with thalassaemia, a
        rare blood disorder, cannot have the therapy as it makes them
        anaemic. </p>
      <p>In 1 to 2 per cent of patients some brain glucose starvation is
        possible. This can be avoided by eating red meat beforehand for
        the methionine content. </p>
      <p>"No supplementation of vitamins A, C, E and selenium or other
        antioxidants is allowed as these render the treatment
        ineffective" </p>
      <p>No supplementation of vitamins A, C, E and selenium or other
        antioxidants is allowed as these render the treatment
        ineffective. </p>
      <p>Smoking is also contra-indicated and the treatment cannot
        commence for several weeks after smoking has ceased. </p>
      <p>Finally, a major contra-indication is chemotherapy. Either
        current or past. Dr Holt is quite adamant about this. Indeed he
        questions the logic, at the cellular level, of many chemotherapy
        'poisons', as he calls them. <br>
        Details </p>
      <p>Full haematology and monitoring takes place and treatment is
        given only as an out-patient. A three week course costs about
        Â£2,500, plus flights, hotels etc. </p>

        he is planning to retire, and his therapy may retire with him. </p>

      <p>9 August 2004 <br>
        Reporter: <b>Ray Martin</b> </p>
      <p>Watch video: dial-up | broadband [Don't miss the amazing short
        video clip available at above link] </p>
      <p>Over a period of 30 years, highly qualified Perth-based surgeon
        Dr John Holt has had some startling successes with a radio-wave
        therapy treatment for cancer patients. </p>
      <p>However, this radical treatment has polarised the medical
        community in Australia. His supporters say he's been vilified,
        while his detractors point out there is no scientific basis for
        his claims. </p>
      <p>Elvina Johnson had a lot of living to do when she was told she
        had an aggressive form of bone cancer. At 18, doctors discovered
        she had a "galaxy of tumours". She lost her leg and underwent
        intensive chemo treatment to try and stop it spreading. Her
        cancer was so severe that she relapsed soon after. </p>
      <p>"It was through both of my lungs and by that stage it was
        pretty terminal," she told Ray Martin. </p>
      <p>Elvina was desperate. Quite by chance she heard about a cancer
        specialist with a highly controversial procedure. </p>
      <p>"By taking the chance and finding this man, I am here six years
        later and probably feeling better than ever, so I have had a
        rebirth," she said. </p>
      <p>Dr Holt's controversial treatment works, in layperson's terms,
        by giving the patient an injection of a glucose-blocking agent.
        He then shines "radio waves" into the body at a specific
        frequency. Dr Holt doesn't guarantee it will cure every cancer,
        but it's not expensive and there's no quackery about it. </p>
      <p>Born in Bristol 80 years ago and a member of the Royal
        Colleges, Dr Holt has 26 medical letters after his name. For
        more than a decade he was in charge of Western Australia's main
        cancer institute, until the late '70s, when he was blacklisted
        by his medical colleagues and politicians. </p>
      <p>"The doctors took up such an action initially, they said the
        treatment was fake and useless," said former WA Premier John
        Tonkin. But Tonkin added, "There is no doubt whatsoever in my
        mind that this is the most advanced form of cancer treatment in
        the world today." </p>
      <p>The polarisation of the medical and scientific community in
        Perth over Dr Holt's treatment has been evident since the
        mid-'70s. </p>
      <p>"It is an unproven form of cancer treatment and it's not part
        of the armoury of orthodox ways of treating cancer in
        Australia," said Clive Deverill, the former boss of WA's Cancer
        Council. "Equally, there are legions of patients who have been
        down that track who can't say anything about their position
        because they're dead." </p>
      <p>While the medical community continues to argue the merits of Dr
        Holt's unorthodox measures, the families of his successes feel
        they owe everything to this gentle man. </p>
      <p>After two brain tumours and a tumour on her spine, Sophia Rosa
        was sent by pre-eminent brain surgeon Dr Charlie Teo for the
        radical treatment. Two years later, the only sign Sophia had
        cancer are the side-effects from the massive doses of
        chemotherapy given in Sydney. </p>
      <p>"Sometimes I think maybe Sophia's reason for getting sick was
        so people would know about Doctor Holt," said Louisa Raso,
        Sophia's mum. </p>

        Health and Medical Research Council found the microwave
        treatment touted by Perth doctor John Holt as a cancer cure was
        not superior to conventional therapy. </p>
      <p>The committee found there was no proof to support the use of
        microwaves in fighting cancer, either alone or when combined
        with radiotherapy. </p>
      <p>Releasing the findings of the year-long review in Melbourne, Mr
        Abbott said he was disappointed the treatment was not the
        magical cure that many had hoped it would be. </p>
      <p>"I have to say I am a little disappointed at this result," Mr
        Abbott said. </p>
      <p>"But the fact is, we have to be objective. </p>
      <p>"Now, I have to say that the conclusions of the study were that
        there is no evidence that Dr Holt's treatment is superior to
        conventional, orthodox cancer treatment. <br>
        AdvertisementAdvertisement </p>
      <p>"And there is considerable evidence that in at least some
        areas, Dr Holt's treatment is inferior to conventional, orthodox
        cancer treatment ... and my very strong recommendation to people
        suffering cancer would be, use orthodox treatment, don't use
        this treatment." </p>
      <p>But he stopped short of saying Dr Holt, who has since retired,
        had placed patients' lives in danger. </p>
      <p>"I think it would be fairer to say that their cancer has not
        been improved by Dr Holt's treatment in ways that couldn't more
        readily have been achieved by more conventional treatment," Mr
        Abbott said. </p>
      <p>Australian Medical Association president Mukesh Haikerwal went
        further, saying the findings showed the treatment could in fact
        be "more dangerous" than conventional methods. </p>
      <p>"It's very important when there are novel treatments out there
        people do not lose sight of the fact that conventional therapies
        are actually there to help them, can make them better and
        shouldn't be discarded for something that's not true and not
        trusted," Dr Haikerwal said. </p>
      <p>The committee examined Dr Holt's patient records along with
        scientific evidence on the therapy, which has gained wide
        publicity amid positive accounts from cancer sufferers. </p>
      <p>The review found microwave cancer therapy in combination with
        radiotherapy was inferior - compared to conventional
        radiotherapy alone - in the treatment of breast cancer, lung
        cancer, lymphoma or prostate cancer. </p>
      <p>It also found radiotherapy resulted in improved symptom control
        rates in bladder cancer patients, than when used in combination
        with microwave treatment. </p>
      <p>The committee recommended a review of the eligibility for
        Medicare funding of Dr Holt's treatment and also called for the
        Therapeutic Goods Administration to examine the safety of the
        microwave machines he used. </p>
      <p>Mr Abbott rejected suggestions Dr Holt had been irresponsible,
        describing him as a very dedicated doctor. </p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Dr Holt declined to comment on the review's
        findings. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Tronado Machine</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Tronado Machine was a device which employed ultra high
        frequency or microwave radiation as a treatment for cancer. A
        man named Tronado designed the machine in the 1970s. </p>
      <p>The treatment was improved and a new type of machine built by
        Dr John Holt who was formerly Head of Oncology at Sir Charles
        Gairdner Hospital, Perth, Western Australia. He later
        established an independent clinic in West Perth. After John
        Holt's retirement the clinic moved to Claremont where a research
        institute was established alongside the clinic. A further
        treating facility was established by Dr Hugh Tinsley in Dublin
        Ireland. This clinic and the treatment were assessed by the
        Irish government and the clinic received government grants to
        assist with the ongoing costs of establishment. </p>
      <p><b>Lack of Scientific Validation</b> </p>
      <p>Tests conducted on behalf of the National Health and Medical
        Research Council of Australia have concluded that UHF Radiowave
        therapy produces no therapeutic benefit when used in conjunction
        with conventional cancer treatment. The report Review of the Use
        of Microwave Therapy for the Treatment of Patients with Cancer
        conducted a review of the literature as well as an audit of Dr.
        Holt's patient records between 1973 and 2003. Regarding the
        literature review, the report stated "There is currently no
        published scientific evidence that shows benefit of UHF cancer
        therapy alone or when combined with ‘glucose-blocking agents’
        (GBA) as treatment for patients with cancer." Regarding the
        audit of Dr. Holt's clinical data, the report says, in part,
        "Despite the small patient treatment groups, some trends were
        evident in this audit. Firstly, the complete remission rates
        were not high in any group. The study did not confirm Dr Holt’s
        previous reports of a 100% response rate for bladder tumours
        (Holt, 1988). The initial response rate (complete response and
        partial response) was 50% for RT alone, 34% for RT + UHF and 17%
        for UHF + GBA. Following salvage surgery, the overall response
        rate (complete response and partial response) was higher for
        patients treated with RT alone (44%) compared to RT+UHF (25%) or
        UHF + GBA (11%)." </p>
      <p>Political motivation is suspected in this finding and in a
        subsequent government report into the Microwave treatment
        practiced by Dr Holt. </p>

          ( 13-Aug-2004 ) </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Concern over Media Coverage Surrounding
              the Tronado Microwave Treatment of Cancer</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The Australian Medical Association (WA) today expressed concern
        over media coverage surrounding the Tronado microwave treatment
        of cancer. </p>
      <p>"We want to send a very strong message to our patients that
        there is no evidence to show the treatment works and they must
        continue conventional treatment," AMA (WA) President Dr Paul
        Skerritt said today. </p>
      <p>"Reports so far have failed to present a complete picture of
        the treatment and its history." </p>
      <p>"The machine has been around for more than 30 years and has
        been subject to many evaluations and reviews around the world
        over that time." </p>
      <p>"There has been no evidence that the treatment is effective in
        curing cancer," Dr Skerritt said. </p>
      <p>"The treatment does not on its own attract a Medicare rebate
        for the patient unless it is used in conjunction with
        conventional treatment." </p>
      <p>"Regretfully there is no published evidence that the treatment
        works." </p>
      <p>"However, we strongly support the open-minded offer of the
        Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists to
        conduct an independent audit so that we can be better informed
        as to the efficacy of the Tronado treatment." </p>
      <p>"It should be noted that there will always be a number of
        patients who will recover from illness without explanation and
        we believe it is irresponsible to present any treatment as a
        cure." </p>
      <p>"It is the doctors and patients of Perth who will have to deal
        with unrealistic expectations that have been created long after
        the publicity has gone and the media has moved on to another
        miracle cure," Dr Skerritt said. </p>
      <p>An email survey of Perth doctors by the AMA (WA) failed to
        produce any evidence the treatment works. </p>
      <p>One Doctor responding to the survey said: "I am fully aware of
        the unrealistic expectations of patients re the Tronado
        Microwave Cancer Treatment. As a Radiation Oncologist working in
        Perth I am faced with these patients virtually every day, as are
        my colleagues. </p>
      <p>"My major concern is that as an oncologist, we are striving to
        practice evidence-based medicine and that sensationalising
        treatments such as the tronado is counter to all of our efforts.
        "It is difficult for patients to understand the complexity of
        medical evidence and research which ultimately guide us in
        patient treatment and decision-making.<br>
