      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0002]</b>The germicidal properties of silver, even not known
      as such, have been utilized since the early Mediterranean
      cultures. It has been known since 1000 BC and possibly before that
      water kept in silver vessels and then exposed to light and
      filtered could be rendered potable. Other forms of silver have
      been used throughout centuries for various applications, such as
      coatings for prevention of beverages from spoilage or silver
      plates and foils in the surgical treatments of wounds and broken
      bones.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003]</b>The lethal effects of metals towards bacteria and
      lower life forms were first scientifically described by von Nageli
      in the late nineteenth century, and this phenomenon has been
      defined as an "oligodynamic effect" (N. R. Thompson, Silver, in
      Comprehensive Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. III D, J. C. Bailer, H. J.
      Emeleus, R. Nyholm and A. F. Trutman-Dickenson, Editors, Pergamon
      Press, Oxford (1973)). The term oligodynamic effect is typically
      restricted to describing solutions in which the metal
      concentration is several orders of magnitude lower than that which
      would be lethal to higher organisms.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004]</b>The investigation of the bacteriostatic properties of
      pure metals such as Fe, Mo, Cu, V, Sn, W, Au, Al, Ta, Nb, Ti, Zr,
      Ni, Co, Ag and Cr, has proved that Co was the only element which
      was inhibitory for the bacterial growth under anaerobic conditions
      (K. J. Bundy, M. F. Butler and R. F. Hochman, "An Investigation of
      the Bacteriostatic Properties of Pure Metals", Journal of
      Biomedical Materials Research, Vol. 14 (1980) 653-663). Under
      aerobic conditions both Cu and Co consistently display inhibitory
      effects. Some antimicrobial effects have been seen for Ni, Fe and
      V. However, other metals such as Mo, W, Al, Nb, Zr, Cr and most
      importantly for the present invention Ag and Sn never showed any
      tendency to inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0005]</b>In the case of silver metal, it was in 1920, when
      Acel who was the first to attribute the antimicrobial properties
      of silver to the liberation of Ag.sup.+ ions from the material (D.
      Acel, "Uber die oligodynamische Wirkung der Metalle", Z. Biochem.,
      112 (1920) 23).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0006]</b>Gibbard reported in 1937 that pure metallic silver
      has no antimicrobial activity (J. Gibbard, "Public Health Aspects
      of the Treatment of Water and Beverages with Silver", Journal of
      American Public Health, Vol. 27 (1937) 112-119). His experiments
      showed that if silver is cleaned mechanically with an abrasive
      cloth or paper it becomes inactive. Similarly, if molten silver is
      allowed to cool in a reduction atmosphere (e.g. hydrogen), no
      antimicrobial activity is found. When cooling of molten silver is
      carried out in air, and formation of surface oxide occurred, an
      antimicrobial activity may be observed. Similar results were found
      when silver metal was treated with nitric acid in an air
      atmosphere (dissolution and formation of an oxide layer). Based on
      Gibbard's results, pure silver was devoid of activity, but surface
      oxidized silver was active. Silver oxide, silver nitrate and
      silver chloride were always active. Also, Gibbard observed that
      the antimicrobial properties of silver and its compounds were
      reduced in the presence of proteins or glucose.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0007]</b>Djokie investigated the behavior of silver films,
      e.g. physical vapor deposited, electrodeposited, electroless
      deposited and metallurgical in physiological saline solutions (S.
      S. Djokie and R. E. Burrell, "Behavior of Silver in Physiological
      Solutions", Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Vol. 145 (5)
      (1998) 1426-1430). Djokie found that an essential factor leading
      to an antimicrobial activity of metallic silver is a presence of
      Ag oxide(s) at the surface of this material. It was demonstrated
      that only silver films containing silver oxides (most likely
      Ag.sub.2O) showed an antimicrobial activity. The behavior was
      attributed to the dissolution of Ag.sub.2O from the "silver"
      material and formation of Ag.sup.+ or other complexed ions which
      become antimicrobially active. There was no evidence that pure
      metallic silver, no matter which way it was produced i.e.,
      physical vapor deposited, electrodeposited or electroless
      deposited could be dissolved in physiological media, or that these
      materials would exhibit antimicrobial activity.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0008]</b>It should be noted that when the physical vapor
      deposition of silver was carried out in an atmosphere containing
      oxygen the resulted product, as found by the XRD analysis
      contained silver oxide. Consequently, these samples exhibited
      antimicrobial activity. Conversely, when the physical vapor
      deposition was carried out from an argon atmosphere (no presence
      of oxygen) pure metallic, nanocrystalline silver film was
      deposited as confirmed by the XRD analysis. However, these films
      did not dissolve in physiological saline solutions, nor they
      exhibited antimicrobial activity at all.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0009]</b>For an in depth understanding of structural
      properties of silver films produced by reactive sputtering, see
      Djokie et al. (S. S. Djokie, R. E. Burrell, N. Le and D. J. Field,
      "An Electrochemical Analysis of Thin Silver Produced by Reactive
      Sputtering", Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Vol. 148 (3)
      (2001) C191-C196.). To prove the concept that only oxidized silver
      species are responsible for the antimicrobial activity, Djokie
      further oxidized pure metallic silver samples (i.e. those produced
      by the electrodeposition, electroless deposition, physical vapor
      deposition in an argon atmosphere or metallurgically). The
      oxidation of these samples was carried out electrochemically in 1
      M KOH solutions, using a process very well established in the art.
      The electrochemically oxidized silver samples were tested for the
      antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. Clear
      evidence was found that the electrochemically oxidized silver
      samples exhibited antimicrobial activity.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0010]</b>The above referenced work shows that only oxidized
      silver species, but not elemental silver will affect antimicrobial
      activity. The findings to date show that the "nanocrystalline" or
      "macrocrystalline" elemental silver does not have antimicrobial
      activity at all. Elemental silver, either nanocrystalline or
      "macrocrystalline" may exhibit some antimicrobial activity only if
      oxidized silver species are present at these surfaces or within
      the silver metal. Only the formation of silver oxide(s),
      carbonates or other silver salts (except silver sulfide, due to
      its extremely low solubility) at the surface or within the
      material, which may be influenced by an exposure of elemental
      silver to various bases, acids or due to atmospheric corrosion may
      lead to an antimicrobial activity of this material.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0011]</b>The use of silver on chronic wounds dates back in the
      17.sup.th and 18.sup.th centuries. In the early 19.sup.th century,
      silver nitrate began to be used on burns and in opthalmology.
      Concentrations of the solution ranged from 0.20 to 2.5 wt. % with
      the weaker solutions being reserved for children. Silver has been
      found to be active against a wide range of bacterial, fungal and
      viral pathogens. Topical treatment of acute and chronic wounds is
      a preferred and selective approach to the prevention of infection
      and healing. In order to achieve these requirements products that
      are used in the prevention of infections must have certain
      physical and chemical properties.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0012]</b>When used for<br>
      &nbsp;topical dressings, silver compounds must have relatively low
      solubility. This is usually achieved by choosing compounds with a
      relatively low solubility products (e.g. AgCl, Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4,
      Ag.sub.2CO.sub.3, Ag.sub.3PO.sub.4, Ag-oxides). Kinetics of
      dissolution of these compounds in neutral aqueous solutions is
      quite slow. This property is very convenient for two reasons.
      First, a sustained release of silver ions from the silver
      compounds is more likely to provide a prolonged antimicrobial
      activity. Second, low amounts of the silver ions released into
      wound exudates may not give rise to transient high tissue blood
      and urine levels, thus avoiding systemic toxicity. The choice of a
      particular silver compound will depend upon its reactivity with
      wound exudates. This reactivity should preferably be minimized in
      order to achieve the desired effect of the released silver ions
      (i.e., antimicrobial activity without systemic toxicity).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0013]</b>Besides silver nitrate, one of the most widely used
      topical antimicrobial materials is silver sulfadiazine (C. L. Fox,
      "Topical Therapy and the development of Silver Sulfadiazine",
      Surgery, Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics, 157 (1) (1983) 82-88). This
      compound is synthesized from silver nitrate and sodium
      sulfadiazine. Silver sulfadiazine has been used in treatments of
      burns, leg ulcers and also as a topical antimicrobial agent in the
      management of infected wounds.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0014]</b>Products such as silver protein (argyrols) or mild
      silver protein are mixtures of silver nitrate, sodium hydroxide
      and gelatin. These products are recommended for internal use and
      are promoted as essential mineral supplements. Although there is
      no theoretical or practical justification for their use, this
      class of compounds has been recommended for the treatment of
      diverse diseases such as cancer, diabetes, AIDS and herpes (M. C.
      Fung, D. L. Bowen, "Silver Products for Medical Indications:
      Risk--Benefit Assessment", Clinical Toxicology, Vol. 34 (1) (1996)
      119-126).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0015]</b>Silver-zinc-allantoinate has been formulated as a
      cream and represents a combination of silver, zinc and allantoin
      (an agent that stimulates debridement and tissue growth (H. W.
      Margaf, T. H. Covey, "A Trial of Silver-Zinc-Allantoinate in the
      Treatment of Leg Ulcers", Arch. Surg., Vol. 112 (1977) 699-704).
      This composition exhibited promising effects in preliminary
      studies.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0016]</b>In the past few decades several topical dressings
      containing silver have been developed for wound care. Such
      materials include Arglaes.TM., Silverlon.TM., Acticoat.TM.,
      Actisorb.TM., and Silver 220.TM..
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0017]</b>Antimicrobial coatings and methods of forming same
      are the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,575 (Burrell et al) and
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,686 (Burrell et al). The coatings are formed
      by the physical vapour deposition of biocompatible metal and the
      preferred biocompatible metal is silver.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0018]</b>Burrell et al teach that atomic disorder may be
      created in metal powders or foils by cold working and in metal
      coatings by depositing by vapor deposition at low substrate
      temperatures and that such metal coatings constitute a matrix
      containing atoms or molecules of a different material. The
      presence of different atoms or molecules results in atomic
      disorder in the metal matrix, for instance due to different sized
      atoms. The different atoms or molecules may be one or more second
      metals, metal alloys or metal compounds which are co- or
      sequentially deposited with the first metal or metals to be
      released. Alternatively, the different atoms or molecules may be
      adsorbed or trapped from the working gas atmosphere during
      reactive vapor deposition.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0019]</b>In U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,686 Burrell et al claim a
      modified material comprising one or more metals in a form
      characterized by sufficient atomic disorder such that the
      material, in contact with a solvent for the material, releases
      atoms, ions, molecules or clusters containing at least one metal
      at an enhanced rate relative to its normal ordered crystalline
      structure. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,575 Burrell et al claim a
      medical device which includes a coating of one or more
      anti-microbial metals having a "sufficient atomic disorder".
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0020]</b>It is unclear from either U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,575 or
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,238,686 what would constitute a material
      characterized by "sufficient atomic disorder". In nature, most
      materials would exhibit sufficient atomic disorder if the true
      atomic disorder described (by drawings or mapping) in ordinary
      Chemistry or Physics handbooks were insufficiently ordered (with a
      regular geometric structure or like).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0021]</b>In any event, the teachings of Burrell et al appear
      to connect "atomic disorder" with an "enhanced rate" of release of
      "atoms, ions, molecules or clusters". If the term "release"
      further relates to a dissolution (as defined in textbooks of
      General Chemistry and Physics), then this dissolution should lead
      to the liberation of ions or molecules in solvent. When released
      in the solvent, these ions or molecules are usually solvated i.e.
      surrounded by the molecules of the solvent. It is very unlikely
      that atoms of a metal will be released into a solution comprising
      of water such as in the wound environment. If released into
      solution in its elemental state, metals would rather represent a
      relatively larger particles comprising of more than one or a few
      atoms.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0022]</b>As a result, the term "atom" as used in Burrell et al
      is not exactly descriptive. It is not known yet scientifically
      whether atoms of metals can be released into aqueous solutions at
      pH close to neutral (e.g., pH range 6 to 8), except in the case of
      colloidal solutions which are usually prepared by adequate
      chemical reactions in-situ.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0023]</b>U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,549 (Flick) discloses a
      multilayer laminate wound dressing comprising a plurality of
      layers of a fibrous material, with each layer comprising a unique
      ratio of metalized fibers to nonmetalized fibers. In a preferred
      embodiment the wound dressing consists of three layers and the
      metal is silver. The wound contact layer has the highest ratio of
      metalized fibers to nonmetalized fibers, the intermediate layer
      has a lower ratio of metalized fibers to nonmetalized fibers, and
      the outer layer has the lowest ratio of metalized fibers to
      nonmetalized fibers. The wound dressing described by Flick is
      commercially available under the trade-mark Silverlon.TM..

      immersion of the article to be treated (e.g., fiber, yarn or

      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0027]</b>The present invention is directed at deposition
      products, composite materials and at methods for the production of
      deposition products and composite materials. The deposition
      products are comprised of at least one oxidized species of a
      metal.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0028]</b>The methods of the invention are based upon chemical
      deposition principles and techniques. The methods of the invention
      may be carried out under either acidic or alkaline conditions. The
      methods of the invention may comprise the step of exposing ions of
      the metal to an oxidizing agent to produce the deposition product.
      The methods of the invention may involve the production of the
      deposition product itself or the production of a composite
      material which comprises a substrate and the deposition product.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0029]</b>The methods of the invention are particularly suited
      for producing a composite material which is comprised of a
      substrate and a very thin coating or deposition layer of the
      deposition product. This thin coating or layer may be in the order
      of one or several atoms in thickness, which facilitates the
      production of a composite material which has a relatively high
      surface area to volume ratio. The coating may also be deposited so
      that it does not completely cover the substrate, thus leaving
      portions of the surface of the substrate uncoated. Composite
      materials produced using the methods of the invention may be
      useful for a variety of applications, including but not limited to
      electronics, materials engineering and medical applications.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0030]</b>The methods of the invention may be carried out at
      relatively low temperatures. Preferably the methods of the
      invention are carried out at temperatures of no greater than about
      60 degrees Celsius. More preferably the methods of the invention
      are carried out at room temperature (i.e., between about 10
      degrees Celsius and about 25 degrees Celsius).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0031]</b>The metal and the oxidizing agent are selected so
      that they are compatible with the production of the desired
      deposition product. As a result, any suitable metal and any
      suitable oxidizing agent may be used in the invention. The metal
      may also be comprised of more than one element, with the result
      that the deposition product may be comprised of at least one
      oxidized species of more than one metal element.

      <b>[0032]</b>Preferably the metal is comprised of silver and the
      deposition product is comprised of at least one oxidized species
      comprising silver. The metal may, however, be further comprised of
      other metal elements such as gold, copper, tin or zinc so that the
      deposition product is comprised of at least one oxidized species
      comprising silver and one or more other metals.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0033]</b>Where the metal is comprised of silver, the resulting
      deposition product may exhibit significant antimicrobial
      properties. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is
      believed that these antimicrobial properties are due to the
      presence in the deposition product of one or more oxidized silver
      species. The presence of other metals in the deposition product
      may enhance these antimicrobial properties or may provide other
      complementary properties to the deposition product.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0034]</b>More particularly, it is believed that silver
      containing deposition products produced using the methods of the
      invention may be comprised of silver ions having valent states
      higher than one, such as for example Ag (II) and Ag (III) valent
      states. It is also believed that silver containing deposition
      products produced using the methods of the invention may be
      comprised of silver ions having more than one valent state so that
      the oxidized silver species may be comprised of a multivalent
      substance. Finally, it is believed that silver containing
      deposition products produced using the methods of the invention
      may be comprised of a silver containing substance or a plurality
      of silver containing substances which react over time to form
      other silver containing substances which may exhibit differing
      antimicrobial properties. It is believed that if this is the case,
      the deposition products produced by the invention may be useful
      for providing a varied antimicrobial response and for overcoming
      bacterial resistance.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0035]</b>In particular, in certain aspects, the methods of the

      comprises a substance having the general formula Ag.sub.7O.sub.8X,
      where X is an anion. The deposition product may be further
      comprised of Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4. The deposition product may also be
      comprised of other oxidized silver compounds such as one or more
      silver oxides selected from the group of silver oxides consisting
      of monovalent silver oxide, bivalent silver oxide, trivalent
      silver oxide and mixtures thereof.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0036]</b>The anion X may be comprised of a single anion or may
      be comprised of a plurality of different anions. The anion may
      therefore be comprised of any anion or combination of ions. The
      anion may, for example, be selected from the group of anions
      consisting of HCO.sub.3.sup.-, CO.sub.3.sup.2-, NO.sub.3.sup.-,
      ClO.sub.4.sup.-, SO.sub.4.sup.2-, F.sup.-, and mixtures thereof.
      The source of the anion may be a metal compound which provides the
      ions of the metal. For example, where the deposition solution is
      comprised of a silver salt such as silver nitrate, the anion may
      be comprised of the nitrate ion (NO.sub.3.sup.-). An alternative
      or secondary source of the anion X may optionally be provided in
      order to provide sufficient quantities of the anion for production
      of the deposition product. Where an alternative or secondary
      source of the anion X is provided, the source of anions may be
      comprised of any source, including but not limited to any organic
      or inorganic acid.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0037]</b>Where the metal is comprised of silver, the composite
      materials produced by the methods may therefore be useful as
      medical devices or as components of medical devices due to their
      specific antimicrobial properties. These composite materials may
      also provide other advantages. As one example, the ability to
      provide a very thin coating or layer of the deposition product on
      the substrate makes it possible to minimize the amount of silver
      which must be used in the composite material in order to provide a
      desired antimicrobial response. As a second example, the ability
      to provide a very thin coating or layer of the deposition product
      on the substrate minimizes the extent to which the deposition
      product will interfere with the properties and functions of the
      substrate, particularly if the deposition product is deposited on
      the substrate so that it does not completely cover the surface of
      the substrate. This second example may be particularly significant
      where the substrate is comprised of an adhesive material such as a
      skin adhesive layer.

      <b>[0078]</b>In a preferred embodiment, the substrate is comprised
      of a wound dressing. The wound dressing may be comprised of any
      material or combination of materials, including but not limited to
      metals, ceramics, glass, polymers, plastics, composite materials,
      natural materials, synthetic materials, synthetic textiles such as
      HDPE, rayon, nylon, polyacetates, polyacrylics and glass and

      <b>[0079]</b>In a preferred embodiment of wound dressing, the
      wound dressing may be comprised of a polymer material such as high
      density polyethylene and may be further comprised of an adhesive
      material comprising a skin adhesive layer. The skin adhesive layer
      may be comprised of a cross-linked silicon gel material. The wound
      dressing and/or the cross-linked silicon gel material may for
      example be comprised of a product sold under the Mepitel.TM.

      trade-marks are owned by Molnlycke Health Care AB of Sweden.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0080]</b>In one application, the deposition product may be
      selectively deposited on the skin adhesive layer and the
      production of the deposition product is preferably controlled so
      that the deposition product does not materially interfere with the
      adhesive properties of the skin adhesive layer, yet still provides
      an acceptable antimicrobial effect without significant undesirable
      toxic effects. This result may be achieved by depositing the
      deposition product on the skin adhesive layer such that the
      deposition product provides a desired antimicrobial effect but
      does not completely cover the surface of the skin adhesive layer.
      In this application, preferably the amount of the deposition
      product which is deposited on the substrate is such that the
      amount of total silver on the substrate is selected to be between
      about 0.1 mg/cm.sup.2 and about 1.0 mg/cm.sup.2, or more
      preferably between about 0.2 mg/cm.sup.2 and about 0.6
      mg/cm.sup.2, in order to achieve the desired result.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0081]</b>In other applications in which the deposition product
      is not deposited on an adhesive such as the skin adhesive layer,
      the amount of the deposition product is preferably controlled to
      balance the desired antimicrobial effect, undesirable toxic
      effects, and economic considerations.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0082]</b>In a third aspect, the invention is a medical device
      comprising a composite material, wherein the composite material is
      comprised of a substrate and a deposition product and wherein the
      deposition product is comprised of an antimicrobially active
      oxidized silver species comprising a silver salt and a silver

      <br>
      <b>[0084]</b>In certain preferred embodiments the invention
      provides methods for depositing a deposition product comprising at
      least one oxidized silver species onto a substrate, thus producing
      a composite material. Since the oxidized silver species of the
      invention exhibit an antimicrobial activity, composite materials
      comprising the oxidized silver species can be used in various
      medical devices for prevention or inhibition of infections. These
      medical devices may include but are not limited to wound
      dressings, adhesives, sutures, catheters and other articles where

      a reasonable etching and cleaning of the surface, followed by
      washing of the article with distilled water until a pH of 7 is
      attained, in order to remove residual alkali; <b>[0088]</b>(b)
      immersing the article in an aqueous silver salt solution. The

      agent can be any oxidizing substance such as persulfates,
      permanganates, hydrogen peroxide and the like, with potassium
      persulfate (K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8) being the most preferred
      oxidizing agent; <b>[0090]</b>(d) adding a stoichiometrically
      suitable quantity of an acid to the mixed silver salt solution
      containing the immersed article in order to provide a source of
      anions. The acids that can be used include any inorganic or
      organic acids including, but not limited to carbonic acid, nitric
      acid, perchloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, fluoroboric
      acid, phosphoric acid, phosphorous acid, citric acid,

      (preferably AgNO.sub.3), the acid (preferably nitric acid,
      perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid or sulfuric acid),
      and the oxidizing agent (preferably potassium persulfate) at
      temperatures between 2 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius with
      temperatures between 10 degrees Celsius and 25 degrees Celsius
      being the most preferred for between about 2 and 40 minutes until
      the article is coated with a grayish, gray or black color; <b>[0092]</b>(f)
      removing the article from the slurry and washing the article with
      distilled water until a pH of 7 is achieved; and <b>[0093]</b>(g)
      drying the article at room temperature.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0094]</b>Alternatively after step (e) the article may be
      immersed in boiling water (about 90 degrees Celsius to about 100
      degrees Celsius) for at least 1 minute.

      <br>
      <br>
      <font size="+1"><b> </b></font><b>[0095]</b>(a) immersing an
      article to be used as a medical device in an aqueous/alcohol
      solution of NaOH for a sufficient time to provide a reasonable

      the article into a solution containing a silver diamino complex in
      a concentration sufficient to adsorb the silver ions at the
      surface of the article and for a duration of about 2 minutes to
      about 5 minutes. The silver diamino complex may be prepared by
      dissolving any silver salt or silver oxide in ammonium hydroxide,
      and may be achieved by adding a stoichiometrically suitable
      quantity of ammonium hydroxide to an aqueous solution or
      suspension of the silver salt or silver oxide until a clear
      colorless solution containing [Ag(NH.sub.3).sub.2].sup.+ is
      obtained. The pH of this solution is usually in the range from
      about 8 to about 12; <b>[0097]</b>(c) removing the article
      without washing or rinsing into another solution containing a
      strong alkali, most preferably NaOH or KOH, and agitating the
      article in this solution until a clear colorless solution is
      obtained and the article is clearly dyed with a tan, gray, brown
      or black color, depending on the desired amount of oxidized silver
      species. The time of contact of the article with the alkaline
      solution may vary, depending on temperature and silver ion
      concentration, but the most preferable duration is about 1 minute
      to about 15 minutes at room temperature or about 1 minute to about
      10 minutes at a temperature of between about 40 degrees Celsius
      and about 60 degrees Celsius; <b>[0098]</b>(d) removing the dyed
      article from the solution and washing with distilled water until a
      pH of 7 is achieved; and <b>[0099]</b>(e) drying the article at
      room temperature.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0100]</b>Alternatively, in step (c), the method may involve,
      depending on the amount of silver required at the surface of the
      article, further additions to the strong alkali solution of the
      silver diamino complex solution and/or additions to the strong
      alkali solution of an oxidizing agent such as a persulfate,
      permanganate, peroxide or a mixture thereof, with potassium
      persulfate being the most preferred oxidizing agent.

      <font size="+1"><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b></font>
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0119]</b>In preferred embodiments of the invention,
      antimicrobial properties of medical devices are achieved by the
      adsorption and deposition of a deposition product comprising an
      antimicrobially active silver species within or at the surface of
      the medical device. These active silver species may include but
      are not limited at all oxidized silver species such as silver
      salts, silver oxide (Ag.sub.2O), higher silver oxides i.e. Ag(II)
      and Ag(III) (AgO, Ag.sub.2O.sub.3, Ag.sub.3O.sub.4 or like),
      silver oxy-salts with a general formula Ag.sub.7O.sub.8X where X
      can include one of acid anions such as sulfates, chlorides,
      phosphates, carbonates, citrates, tartrates, oxalates and like.
      The deposition product may also contain some elemental silver
      deposited during the process.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0120]</b>The term "total silver" as used in herein is the
      total amount of silver as determined by a chemical analysis, which
      may include elemental (metallic) silver as well as silver
      originating from oxidized silver species.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0121]</b>The term "oxidized silver species" as used herein may
      involve but is not limited at all compounds of silver where said
      silver is in +I, +II or +III valent states or any combinations
      thereof. These oxidized silver species include, for example silver
      (I) oxide, silver (II) oxide, silver (III) oxide or mixtures
      thereof, all silver salts having a solubility product higher than
      10.sup.-20 (such as for example Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4, AgCl,
      Ag.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8, Ag.sub.2SO.sub.3, Ag.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.3,
      Ag.sub.3PO.sub.4, and the like), and silver oxy-salts such as
      Ag.sub.7O.sub.8X were X can include but is not limited at
      NO.sub.3.sup.-, ClO.sub.4.sup.-, SO.sub.4.sup.2-, F.sup.- etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0122]</b>The term "medical device materials" as used herein
      may include materials such as metals, ceramics, glass, polymers,
      plastics, composite materials, a variety of natural materials,
      fabrics, textile made of either synthetic (HDPE, rayon, nylon,
      polyacetates, polyacrylics, glass etc.) or natural (cellulose,
      wool, jute, cotton, etc.) fibers.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0123]</b>The term "bacteriostatic activity", as used herein
      relates to the inhibition of bacterial growth, but not to actually
      killing the bacteria. Successful treatment therefore requires the
      host's immune system to clear the pathogen. Treatment is
      compromised when the antimicrobial materials are stopped before
      the pathogen has been completely cleared.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0124]</b>The term "bactericidal activity" as used herein
      relates to killing bacteria with or without lysis of the target
      cell. These types of antimicrobial materials are particularly
      advantageous in immunosuppressed individuals. A disadvantage to
      bactericidal activity is cell lysis, which can release
      lipolysaccharides which are toxic to the host. However, if the
      concentration of the said antimicrobial material is relatively low
      so that toxic effects cannot occur, a combination of both
      bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities may be ideal for
      antimicrobial materials.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0125]</b>In the preferred embodiments, the deposition of the
      deposition product comprising the oxidized silver species is
      accomplished by first providing an aqueous solution of monovalent
      silver salt or a silver complex such as silver nitrate,
      perchlorate or silver diamino complex, with silver nitrate being
      the most preferable if the reaction is carried out under acidic
      conditions or at close to neutral conditions (i.e. at pH below 7),
      and with silver diamino complex, (i.e.,
      [Ag(NH.sub.3).sub.2].sup.+) being the most preferable if the
      reaction is carried out under alkaline conditions (i.e. at pH
      above 7).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0126]</b>Prior to the production of the composite material
      comprising the article as a substrate and the deposition product,
      the article is preferably immersed in an alkaline solution
      containing 50 vol. % ethanol and 50 vol. % of an aqueous solution
      containing 30 g/L NaOH. Other cleaning and etching solutions can
      be used depending upon the material from which the medical device
      is made, upon the toxicity of the said cleaning or etching
      solutions, and upon the possibility that some toxic substances may
      adsorb at the surface of the article. Of course any use of toxic
      or carcinogenic substances during the etching step should be
      avoided. If production of the deposition product is carried out
      under acidic conditions, the article is preferably washed with
      distilled water after the etching step until a pH of 7 is achieved
      in order to remove residual alkali remaining after the etching
      step.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0127]</b>When the reaction is carried out in the pH range
      below 7 (i.e., under acidic conditions), the clean pretreated
      article to be used as a medical device containing oxidized silver
      species at the surface of the same is simply immersed into an
      agitated 1% AgNO.sub.3 aqueous solution as a deposition solution.
      After exposure of the said article to the deposition solution for
      a duration preferably of about 2 to about 10 minutes, a solution
      of an oxidizing agent is added. Alternatively, the oxidizing agent
      may be added to the deposition solution before the article is
      immersed into the deposition solution, but this may result in some
      production of the deposition product before the article is present
      in the deposition solution.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0128]</b>Although a wide range of oxidizing agents such as
      permanganates, persulfates, hydrogen peroxide, hypochlorites etc.,
      may be used under specific conditions and with the proper
      concentrations, the preferred oxidizing agent is a persulfate,
      more preferably either ammonium persulfate or potassium
      persulfate., and most preferably potassium persulfate The
      persulfate facilitates the precipitation and deposition of the
      deposition product on or within the article.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0129]</b>The concentration of persulfate in the deposition
      solution may be in a range from about 1 gram per liter to about
      250 gram per liter with the concentration of about 50 gram per
      liter being the most preferable. After agitation for about 2
      minutes to about 5 minutes, the solution of 1% AgNO.sub.3 and
      persulfate may be acidified with an organic or inorganic acid such
      as HNO.sub.3, HClO.sub.4, H.sub.2SO.sub.4 or CH.sub.3COOH such
      that the concentration of the free acid preferably is about 9%
      HNO.sub.3, 9% HClO.sub.4 acid, 5% H.sub.2SO.sub.4, or 5%
      CH.sub.3COOH. Although other acids may be used the most preferable
      acids are H.sub.2SO.sub.4, HClO.sub.4 or HNO.sub.3.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0130]</b>The agitation of the deposition solution is not
      strictly required, but in order to achieve a more uniform
      distribution of the deposition product and an efficient reaction
      yield, the agitation of the solution is recommended. Agitation can
      be realized by many different ways such as for example mechanical
      stirring, magnetic stirring or ultrasonic agitation.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0131]</b>Following addition of the persulfate (preferably
      potassium persulfate) to the deposition solution of 1% AgNO.sub.3
      within the time of about 1 minute to about 10 minutes, and
      depending on the concentration of the persulfate as well as on the
      conditions of agitation, the formation first of a yellow brown
      color of the solution and then a black grayish precipitate will
      occur. This brown color of the solution is attributed to the
      oxidation of Ag(I) to Ag(II).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0132]</b>The black grayish deposit at the article or in the
      bulk solution is a consequence of the formation of silver
      oxy-salts such as Ag.sub.7O.sub.8X, were X is an anion, depending

      <b>[0136]</b>When the reaction is carried out in the pH range

      comprising an alkaline solution containing alcohol. The most
      preferable solution according to this invention is either NaOH or
      KOH with concentrations 15 to 40 g/L. The alcohol used in this
      solution may be ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol or mixtures therein
      in a concentration above 50 vol. %. The immersion of the article
      into the etching solution is carried out in order to etch and
      clean the surface of the article to provide a reasonable adhesion
      of the deposition product comprising an oxidized silver species
      which is deposited on or within the article thereafter. The
      immersion time of the article is preferably in the range of
      between about 5 minutes and about 20 minutes, with about 10
      minutes being the most preferable.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0137]</b>After the exposure to the alkali/alcohol solution for

      solution containing silver diamino complex i.e.
      [Ag(NH.sub.3).sub.2].sup.+ in a concentration sufficient to adsorb
      silver ions at the surface of the article and for a duration of
      about 2 minutes to about 5 minutes. The silver diamino complex is
      preferably prepared from a silver salt or silver oxide dissolved
      or suspended in water by a dissolution with NH.sub.4OH (28 vol.
      %).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0138]</b>Consequently, the first basic solution is prepared in

      the ammonium hydroxide is added in a stoichiometrically suitable
      concentration so that a clear colorless solution is obtained. The
      concentration of silver ion in this silver diamino complex
      solution, as calculated for Ag.sup.+ ion can vary from 1 to 20 g/L
      with about 10 g/L being the most preferable. The pH of the first
      basic solution is usually between about 8 and about 12 with the
      most preferred pH being in the range of between about 10 and about
      11.

      removed without washing or rinsing into a second basic environment
      comprising a second basic solution containing a strong alkali,
      most preferably NaOH or KOH. The article is kept in this solution
      under agitation until a clear colorless solution is obtained and
      the article is dyed with a tan, gray, brown or black color,
      depending on the desired amount of oxidized species to be
      deposited at or within the surface of the article. The time of
      contact of the article with the second basic solution may vary
      depending on temperature and the silver ion concentration, but
      most preferable time is about 1 minute to about 15 minutes at room
      temperature or about 1 minute to about 10 minutes at a temperature
      of between about 40 degrees Celsius and about 60 degrees Celsius.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0140]</b>Alternatively, the method may involve an addition of
      an oxidizing agent to the second basic solution, preferably a
      persulfate, more preferably either ammonium persulfate or
      potassium persulfate, and most preferably potassium persulfate.
      The oxidizing agent may be added directly to the second basic
      solution containing the article. In addition, depending on the
      amount of silver desired to be deposited as the deposition
      product, addition of a residual silver compound such as the silver
      diamino complex [Ag(NH.sub.3).sub.2].sup.+ may also be beneficial.

      <br>
      <b>[0141]</b>Upon immersion of the article, previously exposed to
      the first basic solution, into the second basic solution, the

      (NH.sub.4).sub.3S.sub.2O.sub.8) to the second basic solution may
      result in the oxidation of silver ions and the reduction of

      C.sub.2H.sub.5OH and 5% CH.sub.3OH) and 50 mL of 28 g/L NaOH
      solution for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes of etching the HDPE mesh
      was transferred without washing or rinsing into 40 mL of an
      Ag.sup.+ solution, containing 15.3 g/L AgNO.sub.3 and a
      stoichiometrically suitable volume of NH.sub.4OH (28 vol. %). The
      HDPE mesh was kept in this solution for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes
      of exposure to the ammoniacal Ag(NH.sub.3).sub.2.sup.+ solution,
      the HDPE mesh was transferred without washing or rinsing into 150
      mL of a 28 g/L NaOH solution stirred with a magnetic stirrer. As
      soon as the HDPE mesh was immersed into NaOH solution, the
      formation of a precipitate yellowish-brown in color occurred.
      Under agitation a residual silver compound (about 38 mL of the
      Ag(I) solution) was added and after that 5 mL of a 250 g/L
      (NH.sub.4).sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8 solution was added. Agitation was
      continued for 10 minutes. During this time the

      immediately became brown. Upon addition of a residual silver
      compound (about 38 mL of the Ag(I) solution) the solution turned
      to a dark brown color and with a continued agitation for about 5
      minutes the solution became black. When the agitation was stopped,
      the black precipitate occurred in the bulk solution as a result of

      perchloric acid (HClO.sub.4), sulfuric acid (H.sub.2SO.sub.4) and
      acetic acid (CH.sub.3COOH) respectively were used as a source of
      anions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0163]</b>Samples of HDPE mesh were immersed in 100 mL of a
      solution containing 1 g AgNO.sub.3. To this solution 1 mL of
      HClO.sub.4 (70%) (Example 7), 0.5 mL of H.sub.2SO.sub.4 (98%)
      (Example 8) and 15 mL of CH.sub.3COOH (5%) (Example 9) were added.
      After 2 minutes of the exposure of HDPE mesh to these solutions,
      20 mL of 250 g/L (NH.sub.4).sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8 was added. The
      mixing was continued for the next 30 minutes. In the solutions
      containing HClO.sub.4 (Example 7) and H.sub.2SO.sub.4 (Example 8)
      formation of a black grayish precipitate occurred similar to
      Example 4. When the precipitate settled the solutions were clear
      and yellow-brown in color. The yellow-brown color suggests the
      presence of Ag(II) complexes in the solution. The coated HDPE mesh
      was then removed from the slurry and carefully washed and rinsed
      with distilled water and thereafter dried at room temperature.
      After drying the HDPE mesh coated in the presence of 1 mL of
      HClO.sub.4 (70%) (Example 7), or in the presence of 0.5 mL of
      H.sub.2SO.sub.4 (98%) (Example 8) appeared to be grayish in color.
      However, the HDPE mesh coated in the presence of 15 mL of
      CH.sub.3COOH (5%) (Example 9) was white and it did not change its
      color.

      <b>[0164]</b>The coated HDPE mesh (Examples 7-9) were analyzed for
      the total silver content, and the antimicrobial activity was also
      evaluated against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Staphylococcus
      Aureus. The amount of total silver deposited on the HDPE mesh was
      estimated at 0.08 mg/cm.sup.2 (for samples coated in the presence
      of HClO.sub.4), 0.07 mg/cm.sup.2 (for samples coated in the
      presence of H.sub.2SO.sub.4) and 0.01 mg/cm.sup.2 (for the samples
      coated in the presence of CH.sub.3COOH). The bactericidal
      activities against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa and Staphylococcus
      Aureus were positive. The CZOI was estimated at about 6 mm (for
      samples coated in the presence of HClO.sub.4 or H.sub.2SO.sub.4)
      and about 1 to 2 mm (for samples coated in the presence of
      CH.sub.3COOH).

      immediately became brown. After mixing for 2 minutes, the solution
      became clear and colorless and the mesh was tan in color. When the
      agitation was stopped, the HDPE mesh was removed from solution and
      washed with distilled water. After washing and rinsing the mesh
      appeared to be tan in color as a consequence of the coating with
      silver compounds.

      <br>
      (a) Deposition of Silver Deposition Products Using
      (NH.sub.--4).sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0178]</b>Upon addition of ammonium persulfate to the
      AgNO.sub.3 solution, a gradual color change from colorless through
      yellow, brown and finally to a cloud solution containing
      grayish-black precipitate was observed. Time for the appearance of
      the grayish-black precipitate at room temperature was estimated at
      5 to 10 minutes. It was noted that if the reaction takes place at
      temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius, the precipitation and color
      change do not occur.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0179]</b>Persulfates are powerful oxidizing agents. In aqueous
      solutions persulfates can be reduced to sulfates (S. I. Zhdanov,
      Sulfur, Selenium, Tellurium and Polonium, in Standard Potentials
      in Aqueous Solutions, A. J. Bard, R. Parsons and J. Jordan
      Editors, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York (1985)). A consequence of
      the reduction of persulfate is the oxidation of Ag(I) to Ag(II)
      and Ag(II) to Ag(III). The grayish-black precipitate deposited on
      the HDPE mesh was formed as a result of the reduction of
      persulfate and a consequent oxidation of Ag(I) ions.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0180]</b>During precipitation of the deposition product, the
      pH of the solution dropped from about 2 to below 1. The decrease
      in pH of the solution was more significant when
      K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8 is used as an oxidizing agent instead of
      (NH.sub.4).sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8, in that a decrease in pH from
      about 7 to below 1 was observed.
      <br>
      <br>
      (b) Properties of Deposition Products Produced Using
      (NH.sub.4).sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0181]</b>The grayish-black precipitate itself represents a
      mixture of silver argentic nitrate
      Ag(Ag.sub.3O.sub.4).sub.2NO.sub.3Ag.sub.7NO.sub.1, and
      Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4. Indeed, as found by XRD analysis, the peaks in
      the patterns showed a reasonable match for Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4 and
      Ag.sub.7O.sub.8NO.sub.3 (FIG. 1). It is apparent that the
      oxidation of AgNO.sub.3 with (NH.sub.4).sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8 leads
      to the precipitation of silver oxy-salt Ag.sub.7NO.sub.11, and
      also Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4. The precipitation of Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4 is
      usually not observed when K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8 is used as an
      oxidizing agent of Ag(I) ions (see the discussion below relating
      to oxidation with K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8).
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0182]</b>FIG. 2 provides a SEM micrograph of the grayish black
      precipitate. The smaller "cubical" particles represent
      Ag.sub.7O.sub.8NO.sub.3 and their size, based on SEM is estimated
      at about 2.5 .mu.m. The shape of these particles was found to be
      in very good agreement with the results of Skanavi-Grigoreva (M.
      S. Skanavi-Grigoreva, I. L. Shimanovich, Zh. Obsh., Khim., 24,
      1490 (1954)). who produced this material by the electrolysis of an
      aqueous AgNO.sub.3 solution. The larger, cylindrical particles
      represent silver sulfate (Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4).

      (c) Deposition of Silver Deposition Products Using
      K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0183]</b>Some differences in the formation of the
      grayish-black precipitate were observed when K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8
      was used instead of (NH.sub.4).sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8, as the
      oxidizing agent of Ag(I). The precipitation of the grayish-black
      compound was significantly faster, and occurred within 1 minute
      upon addition of K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8 to the AgNO.sub.3 solution.
      During this time, the pH of the solution changed from the initial
      pH of about 7 to below 1 after the precipitation.

      <br>
      (d) Properties of Deposition Products Produced Using
      K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0184]</b>As determined by XRD analysis in FIG. 3, all the
      peaks in the pattern exactly match the compound of composition
      Ag.sub.7O.sub.8NO.sub.3. No other compounds were identified in
      this XRD pattern.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0185]</b>The theoretical amount of Ag in the compound
      Ag.sub.7O.sub.8NO.sub.3 is 79.90%. The chemical analysis
      determined that the grayish black precipitate contained about
      78.80% Ag. This result shows a good agreement of the experiments
      with the theory.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0186]</b>The SEM micrographs of the powder produced by the
      chemical oxidation of AgNO.sub.3 with K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8 are
      presented in FIG. 4. It appears that the particles are uniform and
      cubical in their shape. The size of these particles is estimated
      at about 2.5 .mu.m.
      <br>
      <br>
      (e) Antimicrobial Activity
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0187]</b>The comparison of the SEM micrographs of uncoated and
      coated HDPE mesh samples is presented in FIG. 5. As shown in FIG.
      5, the surface of the HDPE is partially covered with the
      Ag(Ag.sub.3O.sub.4).sub.2NO.sub.3 particulates.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0188]</b>These samples were tested for bioactivity against the
      bacteria Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, Staphylococcus Aureus or fungi
      Candida Albicans. As can be seen from the photographs presented in
      FIG. 6, clear zones surrounding the test samples (where a growth
      of tested microorganisms did not occur) were observed in all cases
      for Staphylococcus Aureus (a gram-positive bacteria), Pseudomonas
      Aeuguginosa (a gram-negative bacteria) and Candida Albicans (an
      example of fungi). The size of the controlled zone of inhibition
      (CZOI), where the growth of tested microorganisms was not
      observed, was estimated at 3 mm to 5 mm for all tested samples.
      These results suggest that the deposition products have
      antibacterial and antifungal properties. Furthermore these results
      are in agreement with previously published results, where was
      suggested that only oxidized silver species, but not metallic
      silver exhibit an antimicrobial activity.
      <br>
      <br>
      (f) Conclusions Relating to Examples 15-16
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>[0189]</b>It has been demonstrated that deposition products,
      namely those of composition
      Ag.sub.7NO.sub.11.times.3Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4 or Ag.sub.7NO.sub.1, can
      successfully be deposited as powders or on a substrate such as
      HDPE mesh, by a simple reaction between AgNO.sub.3 and
      (NH.sub.4)S.sub.2O.sub.8 or K.sub.2S.sub.2O.sub.8. These compounds
      are soluble in both concentrated HNO.sub.3 or NH.sub.4OH.
