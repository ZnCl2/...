      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      AIM: Venous ulcers are a common, chronic medical and social
      problem. These ulcers are difficult to heal in most patients with
      sustained venous hypertension. This pilot product evaluation
      registry study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of an
      antimicrobial silver oxide wound dressing ointment ("Silver Oxide
      Ointment") as part of the treatment of 'difficult' venous
      ulcerations.<br>
      <br>
      METHODS:<br>
      The study was conducted measuring the variations in the area of
      the ulceration and microcirculatory parameters.<br>
      <br>
      RESULTS:<br>
      After four weeks, treatment with the Silver Oxide Ointment proved
      more effective than the 'best management' used in controls.
      Transcutaneous PO2 was increased (improved); Laser Doppler skin
      flux and transcutaneous PCO2 were improved (decreased). Also in
      the silver oxide group a significantly higher number of venous
      ulcers were completely healed at four weeks. The silver oxide
      ointment improved both the microcirculation and the healing rate
      of their ulcers. No significant tolerability problems were
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION:<br>
      In difficult venous ulcerations, local treatment with this Silver
      Oxide Ointment, as one component of the total wound dressing,
      improved microcirculation measurements and healing rate. Most of
      the treatments were done at home by the patients or by their
      tutors. This study indicates the important role of this type of
      treatment and indicates the need to plan larger and more prolonged
      studies.<br>

          with topical multivalent silver oxide ointment</b><br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>AIM: In addition to contemporary compression therapy, one of
      the therapeutic approaches is the use of a topical wound care
      agent. The goal of this pilot registry study is to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of a uniquely designed ointment containing
      multivalent silver oxide (Ag4O4) in the healing of difficult
      diabetic or venous ulcerations.<br>
      <br>
      METHODS: Patients who had ulcers resulting from chronic venous
      insufficiency or diabetes participated in this open-label,
      randomized registry study. All patients were evaluated by
      measuring both the area of the ulceration and microcirculatory
      parameters. 148 patients were included in the study and
      categorized into two main groups: venous ulcers and diabetic
      ulcers. Each main group was then randomized into two sub-groups:
      topical treatment with silver oxide ointment and the control group
      (standard cleaning and compression management methods, without
      silver ointment). All patients were treated with accepted cleaning
      and compression management. RESULTS. In subjects with venous
      ulcers: After 4 weeks, the silver treatment was more effective
      than the control group treatment: Skin PO2 was increased 2.1 times
      more than the control group (17.4% to 8.2%) and skin flux (RF) was
      improved 1.6 times more than the control group (-38.7% to -24.2%).
      The total surface area of the ulcer was significantly reduced in
      the silver treatment group by 1.9 times the control group (-88.7%
      to -46.9%). In addition, in the silver treatment group we observed
      complete closure of the ulceration in 42% of subjects compared to
      22% in the control group (P=&lt;0.05). In subjects with diabetic
      ulcers: after 4 weeks, the silver treatment was more effective
      than the control group treatment: Skin PO2 increased 2.6 times
      more than the control group (23.3% to 9.1%) and skin flux (RF) was
      significantly improved 4.3 times more than the control
      group(-26.7% to -6.2%). The total surface area of the ulcer was
      significantly reduced in the silver treatment group by 3.7 times
      the control group (-89.0% to -23.9%). In addition, in the silver
      treatment group we observed complete closure of the ulceration in
      39% of subjects compared to 16% in the control group
      (P&lt;/=0.05).<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides observational data on the
      efficacy of local treatment of ulcers with a multivalent silver
      oxide containing ointment. The silver ointment improved
      microcirculation and the healing rate of all 78 patients that were
      treated with multivalent silver ointment and closed twice as many
      ulcers in 4 weeks compared to the control groups (40.7% silver
      treatment compared to 19.4% for the control). This study
      demonstrates the feasibility of this type of treatment and
      provides evidence of efficacy to plan larger randomized controlled
      studies. The large number of patients that were helped in this
      study demonstrates the efficacy of multivalent silver oxide
      topical ointment and its important role in ulcer therapy.<br>

          nanoparticles against drug-resistant bacteria and leishmania

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Nanotechnology is the creation of functional materials,
      devices and systems at atomic and molecular scales (1-100 nm),
      where properties differ significantly from those at a larger
      scale. The use of nanotechnology and nanomaterials in medical
      research is growing rapidly. Recently, nanotechnologic
      developments in microbiology have gained importance in the field
      of chemotherapy. Bacterial strains that are resistant to current
      antibiotics have become serious public health problems that raise
      the need to develop new bactericidal materials. Metal oxide
      nanoparticles, especially TiO(2) and Ag(2)O nanoparticles, have
      demonstrated significant antibacterial activity. Therefore, it is
      thought that this property of metal oxide nanoparticles could
      effectively be used as a novel solution strategy. In this review,
      we focus on the unique properties of nanoparticles, their
      mechanism of action as antibacterial agents and recent studies in
      which the effects of visible and UV-light induced TiO(2) and
      Ag(2)O nanoparticles on drug-resistant bacteria have been
      documented. In addition, from to previous results of our studies,
      antileishmanial effects of metal oxide nanoparticles are also
      demonstrated, indicating that metal oxide nanoparticles can also
      be effective against eukaryotic infectious agents. Conversely,
      despite their significant potential in antimicrobial applications,
      the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles restricts their use in
      humans. However, recent studies infer that metal oxide
      nanoparticles have considerable potential to be the first-choice
      for antibacterial and antiparasitic applications in the future,
      provided that researchers can bring new ideas in order to cope
      with their main problem of toxicity.<br>

      Autism brains have DNA with 8 RNA viruses which may be inhibited

      <br>
      Hello parents and family members of autistic children:<br>
      <br>
      I have found some interesting information about the RNA viruses
      associated with autism.&nbsp; RNA viruses for HIV and cancer are
      inhibited by Tetrasilver Tetroxide US Pat 5676977 and US Pat
      6485755 respectively...<br>
      <br>
      <hr width="100%" size="2"><br>
      <a href="http://www.hivaidsguide.com/2011/09/tetrasil-imusil/"><b>http://www.hivaidsguide.com/2011/09/tetrasil-imusil/</b></a><b><br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b>Tetrasil (Imusil)</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Tetrasil, also known as Imusil, is a fake-AIDS cure that is based
      on tetrasilver tetroxide, a chemical used to clean pool water.
      Apparently, people are supposed to believe that because a tiny
      amount of this highly dangerous chemical kills bacteria and virii
      in swimming water, that a larger amount will kill infections in
      humans. Of course, it is well known that it is poisonous to drink
      rubbing alcohol. Not many people are familiar with tetrasilver
      tetroxide. This is like saying that because you can use rubbing
      alcohol to clean a cut or scrape, you should drink it to kill a
      cold virus. This ‘cure’ is more likely to poison the user than
      help fight the disease.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, the marketers of Tetrasil, like most proponents of fake
      cures, can’t have a single explanation for how their cure works.
      Apparently the more extreme and outrageous the claims the better.
      So, in addition to the ‘fact’ that tetrasilver tetroxide is used
      in pool ‘proves’ that it is safe to ingest and will kill
      infections, these tiny molecules are actually machines that
      generate electricity and kill the AIDS virus, HIV, by zapping it
      with electricity. (This claim is straight from the US patent for
      Tetrasil, by the way. For those who don’t know – you can file a
      patent for anything, including a time machine that will take you
      to a non-existent universe. The patent office doesn’t care if the
      thing works, just if you are copying someone else. So if you ever
      see anyone waving around a patent as proof that their crazy claim
      is valid – all it proves it no one else was crazy enough to want
      to claim the idea.)<br>
      <br>
      It is, however, very very interesting that the patent claims that
      Tetrasil cures AIDS by electrocuting HIV, since the patent is held
      by a ‘Dr’. Marvin S. Antelman, the maker of Tetrasil, who claims
      that HIV has nothing to do with AIDS! Alright ‘Dr.’ Antelman, I’ll
      give you the benefit of the doubt. Assuming that HIV has nothing
      to do with AIDS, how do you cure a disease by killing something
      that is totally unrelated to it?<br>
      <br>
      You can’t. And you can’t cure AIDS without attacking HIV. Which is
      just one more proof that the so-called doctor doesn’t know what he
      is talking about and is just out to make a buck. Illogical claims
      like this can be sold to people if the seller talks fast enough
      and doesn’t give them time to stop and question the absurdity of
      it, but a legitimate health professional wants people to ask
      questions, wants to have problems pointed out so they can be
      corrected. And a legitimate health worker does not make ridiculous
      claims that directly contradict his OWN PATENT!<br>
      <br>
      That isn’t the only difference between ‘Dr.’ Antelman and a
      legitimate health worker. There are quite a few more. Among them,
      a real researcher wants other people to test their findings, and
      make sure their medicines work. This is called ‘third party
      testing’. A researcher wants this for two reasons. First, someone
      else doing the testing in a different way can make sure they
      didn’t miss anything in their work. Second, it’s a promise to
      their customers – ‘I have let my work be examined by other people,
      who agree that it works and is safe.’ Apparently, ‘Dr.’ Antelman
      feels neither of these are valid concerns, as the company he keep
      proclaiming has tested Tetrasil and found it safe and effective,
      is one that he owns. So basically he is saying ‘I have tested my
      own invention and proved to myself that it is safe and will work –
      and you can take my word for it!’<br>
      <br>
      Worse, it isn’t safe, as Antelman’s own reported test results
      prove. All but one of the people who took part in Antelman’s
      ‘clinical test’ of Tetrasil developed hepatomegaly or enlarged
      livers. An enlarged liver only happens when a person has developed
      a serious medical condition such as liver disease, congestive
      heart failure or cancer! Of course, ‘Dr’. Antleman insists that
      none of the test participants were harmed, and that an enlarged
      liver is not dangerous. No, an enlarged liver doesn’t endanger a
      person – but the problems that cause it DO! Of course, Antleman
      couldn’t be bothered to test for further problems that might have
      led his patients to develop hepatomegaly.<br>
      <br>
      Yet this man, who wants us to take his word, has already
      contradicted himself about how his so-called ‘cure’ works and
      claims it is safe while publicly announcing that his test subjects
      developed medical problems. It’s hard to trust someone who won’t
      play straight, who contradicts himself, and is not open and
      aboveboard.<br>
      <br>
      At this time, Tetrasil is banned in Zambia because it has no
      proven effects for people living with HIV. It is still legal to
      sell in America (people need to be able to disinfect their pools)
      but it is illegal to promote it as a treatment or preventative for
      any disease.<br>
      <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Zambia Bans Untested AIDS Cures</b><br>
      </div>
      November 01, 2009<br>
      <br>
      In Zambia, the government has introduced a law to protect people
      infected with the AIDS virus, HIV, from drugs that could harm
      their health. The law will require all anti-AIDS medications
      coming into the country to undergo clinical testing before being
      sold on the local market. From Lusaka, Danstan Kaunda has the
      story.<br>
      <br>
      Many HIV patients in Zambia have abandoned life-prolonging
      anti-retroviral drugs for what is said to be a miracle cure,
      called ‘Tetrasil.’<br>
      <br>
      Tetrasil appeared on the local market shortly after a Zambian
      weekly newspaper published a story saying it can cure HIV with 21
      days.<br>
      <br>
      The tabloid quoted a controversial US-based California activist,
      Boyd Graves, who said over 10 HIV patients have been disease-free
      since January.<br>
      <br>
      Graves has also said the U.S government manufactured the HIV virus
      in a lab – a charge disputed by the mainstream scientific
      community. According to the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease
      Control, a team of international researchers reported in 1999 that
      they had traced the origins of HIV-1, the predominant strain of
      HIV in the developed world, to chimpanzees in west equatorial
      Africa. The CDC's web page says, "The researchers believe that
      HIV-1 was introduced into the human population when hunters became
      exposed to infected blood." (www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa3.htm)<br>
      <br>
      In response to the controversy over the alleged cure, the
      government of Zambia has banned a local chemist – a sister company
      to the tabloid that published the claims – from selling Tetrasil.
      The government has also banned any press advertisements for it.<br>
      <br>
      Under the new law, the Pharmaceutical Regulatory Authority of the
      Ministry of Health will test the safety and efficacy of all drugs
      and natural remedies, whether they are western medications or
      locally available herbs.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Canisius Banda is a spokesperson in the Ministry of Health.<br>
      <br>
      "A technical working group," he said, "will be put in place to
      study these claims through scientific scrutiny, and if the drug
      (Tetrasil) passes the tests, than we will find ways on how will it
      be rolled out to the public, because it has to be an orderly
      process. We are saying that about 1.6 million people in Zambia are
      living with the HIV virus. Seventy-six thousand of them are on
      ARVs (antiretrovirals), and about 200,000 need to be on them. So
      if the process is not managed properly there could be a stampede
      or chaos."<br>
      <br>
      Banda said claims of a cure for HIV / AIDS are often false – and
      hurt efforts to protect those infected – like government programs
      to provide free anti-retrovirals to pregnant mothers.<br>
      <br>
      "Derailing government programs is not a wise thing to encourage,"
      he said, "because it can threaten national security, and again
      that is a criminal activity. We will continue with the measures in
      place, but also encourage people with these claims, so that they
      are submitted to the ministry for scientific verification."<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the Network of Zambian People Living with HIV and AIDS
      wants the government to arrest anyone found selling Tetrasil.<br>
      <br>
      Zambia has one of Africa’s highest infection rates – with about 16
      percent of its population of 11 million infected.<br>

          5,676,977)</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In October 1977, the United States patented a "method for curing
      AIDS', US Patent # 5,676,977. The product is called
      TETRASIL/IMUSIL and is a one-time injection/infusion that
      eliminates bacterial pathogens in the blood system of an
      individual. It is this cheap and effective cure for AIDS that is
      the subject of my presentation.<br>
      <br>
      As a 29-month recipient of this one time injection, I further
      submit that we have an effective and cheap remedy for AIDS that is
      ready now. Our goal in bringing this information to the
      international community is to serve as aconduit for the necessary
      global "double blind" efficacy clinical trials of this U.S.
      patented CURE for AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      ...Marantech has identified a number of Electron Jumping Compounds
      (EJCs) that have been found in independent laboratory testing to
      exhibit<br>
      antimicrobial activity. However, to date the bulk of Company
      testing of EJCs for pharmacological safety and efficacy has
      centred on tetrasilver<br>
      tetroxide, a multivalent metal oxide also known as Tetrasil..<br>
      <br>
      Independent laboratory and clinical testing indicates that
      Tetrasil molecules selectively target and kill rapidly
      proliferating organisms (e.g., cancer cells and pathogenic
      micro-organisms) through a multitude of nano-level electrical
      discharges followed by physical combination (chelation), while
      leaving normal tissues generally unaffected. The unusual suspected
      kill method may thwart the development of pathogens resistant to
      Tetrasil therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Antimicrobial Activity: It has been known for several years that
      Tetrasil is a potent antimicrobial agent that kills a broad
      spectrum of viruses, fungi, algae and bacteria (including drug
      resistant strains) in vitro at concentrations that have been
      certified safe by the EPA for usage in swimming pools ("EPA
      Levels").<br>
      <br>
      Recent clinical studies commissioned by Marantech and conducted by
      Exetec Labs in Honduras, indicate that topically applied Tetrasil
      can<br>
      lead to dramatic improvements in such infection-caused skin
      conditions as acne, cold sores, herpes lesions, conjunctivitis,
      chickenpox,<br>
      shingles, dermal tuberculosis and ringworm.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, building on earlier informal testing against systemic
      infections (including Candida albicans, dysentery and AIDS),
      Exetec has<br>
      been commissioned to conduct clinical studies of Tetrasil as an
      intravenous treatment for AIDS and tuberculosis.<br>

      Tetrasilver - Not!<br>
      <br>
      What ever happened to the Aids cure Tetrasilver Tetroxide (US
      Patent #5,676,977) which you commented about a few years ago. The
      company marantech is gone from the net and all discussion has
      stopped.<br>
      <br>
      Response from Dr. Pierone<br>
      <br>
      Although the company appears to have vanished there was a small
      study reported last year from Kinshasa on Tetrasilver Tetroxide
      (Imusil). Here is the link.<br>
      <br>
      Actually not all the news was bad. Of the 3 subjects treated, one
      had a false positive HIV test with a negative HIV viral load at
      baseline this subject appears to have done quite well after
      treatment. The other 2 subjects who actually were infected with
      HIV did not so well with a consistent increase in viral load
      following Imusil.<br>

      Tetrasilver Tetroxide (US Patent #5,676,977)<br>
      <br>
      Dear Dr. Pierone, MD.<br>
      <br>
      Recently you were asked online about the possibility that
      Tetrasilver Tetroxide was patented as a "cure" for AIDS/HIV. Your
      response was that it was a pesticide with "little hope" and you
      gave an EPA reference.<br>
      <br>
      I would invite you to look at Dr. Marvin S. Antelman's background
      as a world renowned chemist, who patented the Tetrasilver, and now
      Tetracopper, TetraCobolt, (there are many other) Tetroxides
      multivalent crystal redox devices...as well as USPTO Patents
      pertaining to these devices as to their pharmaceutical efficacy
      against bacteria, fungus and viruses. Because these novel devices
      are miniature reduction/oxidation devices that have polyvalent
      cations in their crystall latices, they posess unique electrical
      activity, and activity against pathogens, unlike the mechanism of
      action of other anti-virals aimed at fusion inhibition or viral
      replication via those target sites (eg. cell surface receptors,
      GP41/GP120 or transcriptases) or the terrible toxic-poisons known
      as nucleoside-derivates...AZT might as well be the HIV equivalent
      to Uracil Mustard.<br>
      <br>
      In your expert medical opinions, before to discount Ag404, Could
      you please review USPTO Patents (5,676,977)(6,645,531)(5,571,520)
      (5,336,499) &amp; (6,258,385)...all relevant on Imusil (infusion)
      and Tetrasil(Tetrasil marketed as a topical ointment)..both
      Ag404...you're previous reference to the EPA compound was one of
      Dr. Antelman's earlier compounds used as an agent against bacteria
      in water sources. These newer compounds are formulated and being
      tested in vitro/vivo against HIV, Herpses, and other viral agents
      and bacteria and have shown great efficacy against the virus and
      associated infections in AIDS patients. You can contact Dr. Marvin
      S. Antelman yourself as well at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot,
      Israel. impy@netvision.net.il.<br>
      <br>
      I think its important to look at the data, the science, and the
      real possibility that the antivirals on the market including
      Fuzeon (Trimeris) may have a unique competitor that has fewer
      toxic effects, and a wide spectral activity against many human
      pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      I would love to see/hear your response after reading thru those
      patents... If you would like to rephrase the reply to your last
      questionaire that it "doesn't look promising" after more thorough
      research, that would be delightful.<br>
      <br>
      Not only is it "promising", it appears to work.<br>
      <br>
      Best, Mark<br>
      <br>
      Response from Dr. Pierone<br>
      <br>
      I first thought that Tetrasil was just another harmless and
      ineffective treatment promoted by herb merchants. The patent
      reports are beyond imagination and show that this is really scary
      stuff!<br>
      <br>
      Data are presented with intravenous infusions of Tetrasil in a
      clinic in Honduras for people with the "candidiasis etiological
      category of AIDS". Well, did they have HIV at all? One would never
      know from this "research report".<br>
      <br>
      "All were terminal, some, however, were in moderate condition, and
      others in poor" What is this nonsense about terminal AIDS
      patients?<br>
      <br>
      "...indicates whether hepatomegaly occurred. This was an
      unfortunate consequence of the treatment which resulted in
      enlarged livers in all patients except the second one"
      Unfortunate, indeed!<br>
      <br>
      As I read this patent report detailing the "cure" or AIDS with
      Tetrasil my overwhelming sense was that the evidence presented
      would fail a 5th grade science project. But beyond that, the
      studies detailed were unethical to the exteme.<br>
      <br>
      Stay away from this stuff like the plague!<br>
      <br>
      See excepts below:<br>
      <br>
      Five patients afflicted with AIDS of the candidiasis etiological
      category were segregated for Tetrasil treatment. The rationale for
      selecting them was based on facts presented in an article by Peter
      H. Duesberg and Brian J. Ellison entitled "Is The AIDS Virus A
      Science Fiction?" (Policy Review, Summer 1990 pp. 40-51).<br>
      <br>
      Only the factual presentations of the article were utilized and
      the hypothesis of the authors was ignored. The facts presented in
      the article related to the method of selecting AIDS patients based
      on the five aforementioned etiological subgroups targeted by the
      CDC, and the evidence presented, that there is AIDS without HIV as
      well as with it so that an anti-viral agent in most instances will
      not necessarily restore the immunity system.<br>
      <br>
      Evaluations with Tetrasil were conducted on AIDS patients at Lucha
      Contra el Sida, Comayaguela, Honduras. The patients two weeks
      prior to inoculation were removed from their AZT, AIDS therapy.
      Tetrasil was administered at approximately 40 PPM of blood volume
      per patient as a suspension in a proprietary buffer solution
      (pH=6.5), supplied by Holipharm Corporation.<br>
      <br>
      The results of evaluations with candidiasis are tabulated in Table
      I under its disease category. All patients evaluated were
      terminal. Some, however, were in moderate (m) condition and others
      in poor (p) as designated in the Table. The I and F designations
      refer to initial and final values as shown. WBC indicates white
      cell blood count. The H column, following CD 8, indicates whether
      hepatomegaly occurred. This was an unfortunate consequence of the
      treatment which resulted in enlarged livers in all patients except
      the second one. Despite hepatomegaly, there was no interference
      with liver function.<br>

      For several years, Boyd Graves and Leonard Horowitz have spoken
      about HIV AIDS being manufactured and funded by the US government
      with the knowledge that it could be used to kill massive
      populations of humans. Since the mid-1980s, I have maintained that
      it is a race-specific weapon and even wrote about it being such in
      1990-91. It was in 1996 that some scientists found this to be the
      case, linked to the CCR5 Delta 32 negative genetic mutation making
      it impossible for millions of whites to contract HIV AIDS. Such is
      not the case for Africans and Asians, the highest birthrate
      groups. I also indicated they manufactured a strain of the virus
      that targeted certain genetic characteristics with white
      homosexual men. The reason for the targeting of this group was
      because eugenicists discovered that where there is high
      homosexuality among whites, the birthrates are lower. The case I
      quoted in 1988-89 was with Denmark and Sweden, having the highest
      homosexuality rate and the lowest negative birthrate of all
      Western European countries. This videos main theme is about the
      patent, purported to be a cure for HIV AIDS. The text of this
      patent in this video is clear and readable. Barack Obama has
      stated publicly that it is absurd to believe the US government
      created the HIV AIDS. We did not press him about his wrong
      assumption because had he stated the truth, as most blacks know it
      to be, it would have politically stopped his run for the
      presidency. You can't bring about big changes if you're not the
      president. It is now different and we're going to press this very,
      very serious issue far more devastating to Blacks around the
      world. I promise that we shall make this a key agenda in America,
      far beyond gays wanting to be married. I'm sure millions of blacks
      dying in Africa, in America and elsewhere is a much more important
      issue. It is crippling economies all across the African continent
      with millions of orphaned children and adults too sick to work and
      build economies.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      TETRASILVER has been studied for over 10 years, showing that it
      is, both, very effective and very safe in skin care applications.<br>
      <br>
      In-Vitro Testing:<br>
      "In-vitro" means an artificial environment created outside a
      living organism (e.g., a test tube or culture plate) used in
      experimental research to study a disease or process. Before
      tetraSILVER became our products’ unique ingredient it was tested
      by 14 independent research labs against gram-negative bacteria,
      gram-positive bacteria, fungi, yeast, and viruses. The labs
      included Quintiles, Parexel, MDS/Pharma, and other world renowned
      research organizations. Test after test documented the powerful
      antimicrobial properties of tetraSILVER.<br>
      <br>
      Toxicity Testing:<br>
      In 1966, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved
      tetraSILVER as an effective disinfectant in swimming pools, after
      extensive tests showed this Silver Oxide was capable of quickly
      killing a wide spectrum of germs. In the same series of studies,
      the EPA also determined that TetraSILVER was safe, after passing a
      series of oral (swallowing), dermal (skin), and ocular (eye)
      toxicity tests. These tests were very important because some
      people are in pools every day.<br>
      <br>
      Clinical Testing:<br>
      Initial clinical investigations with 328 people (conducted by
      research dermatologists), in addition to reports from doctors
      throughout the world, strongly suggest that TetraSILVER, as a key
      ingredient in skin care products, provides outstanding benefits
      and supports the body's ability to quickly resolve many common
      skin problems.<br>

      Compassion Response Network developed action projects in both
      Kinshasa and Harare. In all, once adequately funded, the projects
      would treat 43<br>
      advanced AIDS patients over six months, each patient being on one
      of nine alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS;<br>
      <br>
      Zapper + colloidal silver + ozonated water, Dr Bob Beck treatment,
      Tetrasil/Imusil,&nbsp; Essiac formula, Flor Essence, Aurea Cento
      Spice Oils, Glyco-nutritional supplements, Absolutely pure
      colloidal silver + Oxyrich, Sutherlandia herb.<br>
      <br>
      Each of these treatments has impressive claims for treating
      HIV/AIDS, but we remain impartial and detached from those claims.<br>
      <br>
      Our task is to provide an independent comparative assessment of
      many alternative treatments for HIV/AIDS, something we believe had
      never been<br>
      done before. A daily nutritious meal would be provided to each of
      the patients (for otherwise many were so poor that once they were
      half better they would need to go and look for work simply to
      eat.)<br>
      <br>
      The treatments were donated or provided for free, and the
      networking facilitators within Compassion Response Network serve
      on a voluntary<br>
      basis. However conditions in Africa are difficult and to do things
      properly various expenses would arise, food, transport, wages for
      cooks<br>
      and staff to provide treatments, comprehensive blood testing every
      two months of treatment and miscellaneous costs.<br>
      <br>
      Blood tests would involve state of the art medical tests; bDNA
      viral load, CD4 immunity tests, full blood count and several other
      tests pre-treatment and at every 2-month stage of the 6 months of
      treatment.<br>

      As soon as I spotten Dusenberg's name in the links, I knew we were
      dealing with fringe science. These hucksters tack "TETRASIL is
      currently sold without FDA approval as a no-claim product" in an
      effort to avoid the FDA approval process, and then make treatment
      claims for the product: "treat a variety of bacterial, viral,
      fungal and other skin conditions". Sorry, but any firm that
      doesn't want to prove that their product works and won't hurt me
      in the process doesn't get my business. Posts: 88 | From: Metro DC

      Amazing. When/where can I get some stock in the company. This

      Here's an idea: instead of clinical trials, let's have Xtreme
      Pharmaceuticals - a reality show where contestants with a range of
      conditions, from life threatening to minor, take an unidentified
      substance to see if it helps or hurts them.<br>
      <br>
      Watch the bodybuilder's liver implode! Share the drama of the
      little old lady with arthritis as she realizes she'll never see
      her grandkids graduate. Jeer the male model with mild acne that
      winds up disfiguring himself.<br>
      <br>
      There can be twists - when a drug is found that actually works,
      the contestant has to select their drug from several different
      sources - which is from an inspected US factory? - which is from
      an uninspected factory in China? - which was concocted in a garage
      in Arizona?<br>

      It is legal to use it in the US--it has been registered since 1996
      by the US EPA as a pesticide to disinfect swimming pools and hot
      tubs. You can buy it as SilSpa and SilDate. That means the
      registrant had to prove it controls bacteria in pools &amp; spas,

      <br>
      Controlling bacteria in water is a far cry from curing AIDS in
      people. I found a lot of good studies where silver oxide is being

      I've used Tetrasil and it works. It's the best anti-fungal cream
      I've ever used. Athletes foot gone on day 2, and it never came
      back.<br>
      <br>
      People who say the people making it are evil for making false
      claim and providing false hope know nothing.<br>
      <br>
      There have been clinical trials regarding AIDS patients and
      Tetrasil does work as claimed.<br>
