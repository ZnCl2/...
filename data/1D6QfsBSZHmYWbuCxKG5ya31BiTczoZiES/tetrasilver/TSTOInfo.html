      In October 1977, the United States patented a "method for curing
      AIDS', US Patent # 5,676,977. The product is called
      TETRASIL/IMUSIL and is a one-time injection/infusion that
      eliminates bacterial pathogens in the blood system of an
      individual. It is this cheap and effective cure for AIDS that is
      the subject of my presentation.<br>
      As a 29-month recipient of this one time injection, I further
      submit that we have an effective and cheap remedy for AIDS that is
      ready now. Our goal in bringing this information to the
      international community is to serve as aconduit for the necessary
      global "double blind" efficacy clinical trials of this U.S.
      patented CURE for AIDS.<br>
      Independent laboratory and clinical testing indicates that
      Tetrasil molecules selectively target and kill rapidly
      proliferating organisms (e.g., cancer cells and pathogenic
      micro-organisms) through a multitude of nano-level electrical
      discharges followed by physical combination (chelation), while
      leaving normal tissues generally unaffected. The unusual suspected
      kill method may thwart the development of pathogens resistant to
      Tetrasil therapy.<br>

      The germicidal properties of silver, even not known as such, have
      been utilized since the early Mediterranean cultures. It has been
      known since 1000 BC and possibly before that water kept in silver
      vessels and then exposed to light and filtered could be rendered
      potable. Other forms of silver have been used throughout centuries
      for various applications, such as coatings for prevention of
      beverages from spoilage or silver plates and foils in the surgical
      treatments of wounds and broken bones...<br>
      Djokie found that an essential factor leading to an antimicrobial
      activity of metallic silver is a presence of Ag oxide(s) at the
      surface of this material. It was demonstrated that only silver
      films containing silver oxides (most likely Ag.sub.2O) showed an

      ...it appears that in addition to acting as a killing agent in its

      antimicrobial activity of tetrasilver tetroxide, thus yielding a
      synergistic killing effect exceeding the individual killing
      effects of either non-activated tetrasilver tetroxide or ozone. <br>
      <b>Example 5: </b>Ozone Stability Testing 6.1 mg/L (6.1 ppm) of

      period. The solution was allowed to stand with stirring by a
      magnetic stirrer over a 24-hour period, taking periodic readings
      of the ozone concentration. By 2 hours, the ozone concentration
      was 3 ppm and progressively dropped to 0.01 ppm by 18 hours. This
      represented a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When 2 ppm
      tetrasilver tetroxide was added, the rate of decay was
      unexpectedly lengthened, such that 0.12 ppm of ozone was present
      after 18 hours (approximately an order of magnitude higher than
      would have been expected in the absence of tetrasilver tetroxide)

      A novel molecular scale device is described which is bactericidal,
      fungicidal, viricidal and algicidal. The anti-pathogenic
      properties of the device are attributed to electron activity
      indigenous to diamagnetic semiconducting crystals of tetrasilver
      tetroxide ( Ag4O4 )... When the crystals are activated with an
      oxidizing agent, they release electrons equivalent to 6.4 x 10-19
      watts per molecule which in effect electrocute pathogens. A
      multitude of these devices are effective at such low
      concentrations as 0.3 PPM used as preservatives in a variety of
      formulations ranging from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals. Indeed,
      they are intended as active ingredients for pharmaceuticals
      formulated to destroy such pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus, and
      epidermidis, the latter of which it completely destroys in a
      nutrient broth culture of about 1 million organisms at 0.6 PPM, or
      Candida albercans, the vaginal yeast infection at 2.5 PPM, and the
      AIDS virus at 18 PPM...&nbsp; [t]he devices were able to kill two

      0.6 PPM; Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1.25 PPM; and Streptococcus

      The ozonated form of the compound tetrasilver tetroxide has an
      antimicrobial effect greater than that of non-oxidated tetrasilver
      tetroxide..In embodiments of the invention, ozonated tetrasilver
      tetroxide has an antimicrobial effect at least equal to that of
      potassium monopersulfate-activated tetrasilver tetroxide. <br>

      <b> </b>CONCLUSION: This pilot study provides observational data
      on the efficacy of local treatment of ulcers with a multivalent
      silver oxide containing ointment. The silver ointment improved
      microcirculation and the healing rate of all 78 patients that were
      treated with multivalent silver ointment and closed twice as many
      ulcers in 4 weeks compared to the control groups (40.7% silver
      treatment compared to 19.4% for the control). This study
      demonstrates the feasibility of this type of treatment and
      provides evidence of efficacy to plan larger randomized controlled
      studies. The large number of patients that were helped in this
      study demonstrates the efficacy of multivalent silver oxide
      topical ointment and its important role in ulcer therapy.<br>

      After four weeks, treatment with the Silver Oxide Ointment proved

          effects of TiO(2) and Ag(2)O nanoparticles against

      </div>
      Metal oxide nanoparticles, especially TiO(2) and Ag(2)O
      nanoparticles, have demonstrated significant antibacterial
      activity. Therefore, it is thought that this property of metal
      oxide nanoparticles could effectively be used as a novel solution
      strategy. In this review, we focus on the unique properties of
      nanoparticles, their mechanism of action as antibacterial agents
      and recent studies in which the effects of visible and UV-light
      induced TiO(2) and Ag(2)O nanoparticles on drug-resistant bacteria
      have been documented. In addition, from to previous results of our
      studies, antileishmanial effects of metal oxide nanoparticles are
      also demonstrated, indicating that metal oxide nanoparticles can
      also be effective against eukaryotic infectious agents.
      Conversely, despite their significant potential in antimicrobial
      applications, the toxicity of metal oxide nanoparticles restricts
      their use in humans. However, recent studies infer that metal
      oxide nanoparticles have considerable potential to be the
      first-choice for antibacterial and antiparasitic applications in
      the future, provided that researchers can bring new ideas in order
      to cope with their main problem of toxicity.<br>
