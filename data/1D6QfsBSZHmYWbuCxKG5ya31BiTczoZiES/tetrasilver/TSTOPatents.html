      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      The germicidal properties of silver, even not known as such, have
      been utilized since the early Mediterranean cultures. It has been
      known since 1000 BC and possibly before that water kept in silver
      vessels and then exposed to light and filtered could be rendered
      potable. Other forms of silver have been used throughout centuries
      for various applications, such as coatings for prevention of
      beverages from spoilage or silver plates and foils in the surgical
      treatments of wounds and broken bones.<br>
      <br>
      The lethal effects of metals towards bacteria and lower life forms
      were first scientifically described by von Nageli in the late
      nineteenth century, and this phenomenon has been defined as an
      "oligodynamic effect" (N. R. Thompson, Silver, in Comprehensive
      Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. III D, J. C. Bailer, H. J. Emeleus, R.
      Nyholm and A. F. Trutman-Dickenson, Editors, Pergamon Press,
      Oxford (1973)). The term oligodynamic effect is typically
      restricted to describing solutions in which the metal
      concentration is several orders of magnitude lower than that which
      would be lethal to higher organisms.<br>
      <br>
      The investigation of the bacteriostatic properties of pure metals
      such as Fe, Mo, Cu, V, Sn, W, Au, Al, Ta, Nb, Ti, Zr, Ni, Co, Ag
      and Cr, has proved that Co was the only element which was
      inhibitory for the bacterial growth under anaerobic conditions (K.
      J. Bundy, M. F. Butler and R. F. Hochman, "An Investigation of the
      Bacteriostatic Properties of Pure Metals", Journal of Biomedical
      Materials Research, Vol. 14 (1980) 653-663). Under aerobic
      conditions both Cu and Co consistently display inhibitory effects.
      Some antimicrobial effects have been seen for Ni, Fe and V.
      However, other metals such as Mo, W, Al, Nb, Zr, Cr and most
      importantly for the present invention Ag and Sn never showed any
      tendency to inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of silver metal, it was in 1920, when Acel who was the
      first to attribute the antimicrobial properties of silver to the
      liberation of Ag.sup.+ ions from the material (D. Acel, "Uber die
      oligodynamische Wirkung der Metalle", Z. Biochem., 112 (1920) 23).<br>
      <br>
      Gibbard reported in 1937 that pure metallic silver has no
      antimicrobial activity (J. Gibbard, "Public Health Aspects of the
      Treatment of Water and Beverages with Silver", Journal of American
      Public Health, Vol. 27 (1937) 112-119). His experiments showed
      that if silver is cleaned mechanically with an abrasive cloth or
      paper it becomes inactive. Similarly, if molten silver is allowed
      to cool in a reduction atmosphere (e.g. hydrogen), no
      antimicrobial activity is found. When cooling of molten silver is
      carried out in air, and formation of surface oxide occurred, an
      antimicrobial activity may be observed. Similar results were found
      when silver metal was treated with nitric acid in an air
      atmosphere (dissolution and formation of an oxide layer). Based on
      Gibbard's results, pure silver was devoid of activity, but surface
      oxidized silver was active. Silver oxide, silver nitrate and
      silver chloride were always active. Also, Gibbard observed that
      the antimicrobial properties of silver and its compounds were
      reduced in the presence of proteins or glucose.<br>
      <br>
      Djokie investigated the behavior of silver films, e.g. physical
      vapor deposited, electrodeposited, electroless deposited and
      metallurgical in physiological saline solutions (S. S. Djokie and
      R. E. Burrell, "Behavior of Silver in Physiological Solutions",
      Journal of the Electrochemical Society, Vol. 145 (5) (1998)
      1426-1430). Djokie found that an essential factor leading to an
      antimicrobial activity of metallic silver is a presence of Ag
      oxide(s) at the surface of this material. It was demonstrated that
      only silver films containing silver oxides (most likely Ag.sub.2O)
      showed an antimicrobial activity. The behavior was attributed to
      the dissolution of Ag.sub.2O from the "silver" material and
      formation of Ag.sup.+ or other complexed ions which become
      antimicrobially active. There was no evidence that pure metallic
      silver, no matter which way it was produced i.e., physical vapor
      deposited, electrodeposited or electroless deposited could be
      dissolved in physiological media, or that these materials would
      exhibit antimicrobial activity.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that when the physical vapor deposition of
      silver was carried out in an atmosphere containing oxygen the
      resulted product, as found by the XRD analysis contained silver
      oxide. Consequently, these samples exhibited antimicrobial
      activity. Conversely, when the physical vapor deposition was
      carried out from an argon atmosphere (no presence of oxygen) pure
      metallic, nanocrystalline silver film was deposited as confirmed
      by the XRD analysis. However, these films did not dissolve in
      physiological saline solutions, nor they exhibited antimicrobial
      activity at all.<br>
      <br>
      For an in depth understanding of structural properties of silver
      films produced by reactive sputtering, see Djokie et al. (S. S.
      Djokie, R. E. Burrell, N. Le and D. J. Field, "An Electrochemical
      Analysis of Thin Silver Produced by Reactive Sputtering", Journal
      of the Electrochemical Society, Vol. 148 (3) (2001) C191-C196.).
      To prove the concept that only oxidized silver species are
      responsible for the antimicrobial activity, Djokie further
      oxidized pure metallic silver samples (i.e. those produced by the
      electrodeposition, electroless deposition, physical vapor
      deposition in an argon atmosphere or metallurgically). The
      oxidation of these samples was carried out electrochemically in 1
      M KOH solutions, using a process very well established in the art.
      The electrochemically oxidized silver samples were tested for the
      antimicrobial activity against Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. Clear
      evidence was found that the electrochemically oxidized silver
      samples exhibited antimicrobial activity.<br>
      <br>
      The above referenced work shows that only oxidized silver species,
      but not elemental silver will affect antimicrobial activity. The
      findings to date show that the "nanocrystalline" or
      "macrocrystalline" elemental silver does not have antimicrobial
      activity at all. Elemental silver, either nanocrystalline or
      "macrocrystalline" may exhibit some antimicrobial activity only if
      oxidized silver species are present at these surfaces or within
      the silver metal. Only the formation of silver oxide(s),
      carbonates or other silver salts (except silver sulfide, due to
      its extremely low solubility) at the surface or within the
      material, which may be influenced by an exposure of elemental
      silver to various bases, acids or due to atmospheric corrosion may
      lead to an antimicrobial activity of this material.<br>
      <br>
      The use of silver on chronic wounds dates back in the 17.sup.th
      and 18.sup.th centuries. In the early 19.sup.th century, silver
      nitrate began to be used on burns and in opthalmology.
      Concentrations of the solution ranged from 0.20 to 2.5 wt. % with
      the weaker solutions being reserved for children. Silver has been
      found to be active against a wide range of bacterial, fungal and
      viral pathogens. Topical treatment of acute and chronic wounds is
      a preferred and selective approach to the prevention of infection
      and healing. In order to achieve these requirements products that
      are used in the prevention of infections must have certain
      physical and chemical properties.<br>
      <br>
      When used for topical dressings, silver compounds must have
      relatively low solubility. This is usually achieved by choosing
      compounds with a relatively low solubility products (e.g. AgCl,
      Ag.sub.2SO.sub.4, Ag.sub.2CO.sub.3, Ag.sub.3PO.sub.4, Ag-oxides).
      Kinetics of dissolution of these compounds in neutral aqueous
      solutions is quite slow. This property is very convenient for two
      reasons. First, a sustained release of silver ions from the silver
      compounds is more likely to provide a prolonged antimicrobial
      activity. Second, low amounts of the silver ions released into
      wound exudates may not give rise to transient high tissue blood
      and urine levels, thus avoiding systemic toxicity. The choice of a
      particular silver compound will depend upon its reactivity with
      wound exudates. This reactivity should preferably be minimized in
      order to achieve the desired effect of the released silver ions
      (i.e., antimicrobial activity without systemic toxicity).<br>
      <br>
      Besides silver nitrate, one of the most widely used topical
      antimicrobial materials is silver sulfadiazine (C. L. Fox,
      "Topical Therapy and the development of Silver Sulfadiazine",
      Surgery, Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics, 157 (1) (1983) 82-88). This
      compound is synthesized from silver nitrate and sodium
      sulfadiazine. Silver sulfadiazine has been used in treatments of
      burns, leg ulcers and also as a topical antimicrobial agent in the
      management of infected wounds.<br>
      <br>
      Products such as silver protein (argyrols) or mild silver protein
      are mixtures of silver nitrate, sodium hydroxide and gelatin.
      These products are recommended for internal use and are promoted
      as essential mineral supplements. Although there is no theoretical
      or practical justification for their use, this class of compounds
      has been recommended for the treatment of diverse diseases such as
      cancer, diabetes, AIDS and herpes (M. C. Fung, D. L. Bowen,
      "Silver Products for Medical Indications: Risk--Benefit
      Assessment", Clinical Toxicology, Vol. 34 (1) (1996) 119-126).<br>
      <br>
      Silver-zinc-allantoinate has been formulated as a cream and
      represents a combination of silver, zinc and allantoin (an agent
      that stimulates debridement and tissue growth (H. W. Margaf, T. H.
      Covey, "A Trial of Silver-Zinc-Allantoinate in the Treatment of
      Leg Ulcers", Arch. Surg., Vol. 112 (1977) 699-704). This
      composition exhibited promising effects in preliminary studies.<br>
      <br>
      In the past few decades several topical dressings containing
      silver have been developed for wound care. Such materials include
      Arglaes.TM., Silverlon.TM., Acticoat.TM., Actisorb.TM., and Silver
      220.TM..<br>
      <br>
      Antimicrobial coatings and methods of forming same are the subject
      of U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,575 (Burrell et al) and U.S. Pat. No.
      6,238,686 (Burrell et al). The coatings are formed by the physical
      vapour deposition of biocompatible metal and the preferred
      biocompatible metal is silver.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,087,549 (Flick) discloses a multilayer laminate
      wound dressing comprising a plurality of layers of a fibrous
      material, with each layer comprising a unique ratio of metalized
      fibers to nonmetalized fibers. In a preferred embodiment the wound
      dressing consists of three layers and the metal is silver. The
      wound contact layer has the highest ratio of metalized fibers to
      nonmetalized fibers, the intermediate layer has a lower ratio of
      metalized fibers to nonmetalized fibers, and the outer layer has
      the lowest ratio of metalized fibers to nonmetalized fibers. The
      wound dressing described by Flick is commercially available under
      the trade-mark Silverlon.TM..<br>
      <br>
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,855 (Antelman), U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,977
      (Antelman) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,420 (Antelman) teach that
      tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag.sub.4O.sub.4) containing two monovalent
      and two trivalent silver ions exhibits bactericidal, fungicidal
      and algicidal properties. As a result, "tetrasilver tetroxide" is
      suggested for use for water treatment in U.S. Pat. No. 5,211,855
      and for use in destroying the AIDS virus in U.S. Pat. No.
      5,676,977.<br>
      <br>
      In U.S. Pat. No. 6,436,420, Antelman describes a method of
      deposition or interstitial precipitation of tetrasilver tetroxide
      (Ag.sub.4O.sub.4) crystals within the interstices of fibers, yarns
      and/or fabrics forming such articles in order to produce fibrous
      textile articles possessing enhanced antimicrobial properties. The
      interstitial precipitation of Ag.sub.4O.sub.4 is achieved by
      immersion of the article to be treated (e.g., fiber, yarn or
      fabric) in an aqueous solution containing a water soluble silver
      salt, most preferably silver nitrate. After uniformly wetting the
      article, the article is removed into a second heated aqueous
      solution (having a temperature of at least 85 degrees Celsius or
      more preferably at least 90 degrees Celsius) containing strong
      alkali (most preferably NaOH) and a water soluble oxidizing agent
      (most preferably potassium persulfate) for 30 seconds to 5 minutes
      to facilitate the precipitation of tetrasilver tetroxide.<br>
      <br>
      After the reaction is completed, the article is removed and
      washed. The article treated in this way is described as exhibiting
      outstanding antimicrobial resistance towards pathogens such as
      bacteria, viruses, yeast and algae. The article is also described
      as being resistant to ultraviolet light and as maintaining its
      antimicrobial properties after a number of launderings</blockquote>

      <b>OZONATED SOLUTIONS OF TETRASILVER TETROXIDE</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote><br>
      ...it appears that in addition to acting as a killing agent in its
      own right, ozone is surprisingly able to activate the
      antimicrobial activity of tetrasilver tetroxide, thus yielding a
      synergistic killing effect exceeding the individual killing
      effects of either non-activated tetrasilver tetroxide or ozone. <br>
      <br>
      Example 5: Ozone Stability Testing 6.1 mg/L (6.1 ppm) of ozone was
      provided in deionized, distilled water over a 15 minute period.
      The solution was allowed to stand with stirring by a magnetic
      stirrer over a 24-hour period, taking periodic readings of the
      ozone concentration. By 2 hours, the ozone concentration was 3 ppm
      and progressively dropped to 0.01 ppm by 18 hours. This
      represented a half-life of approximately 2 hours. When 2 ppm
      tetrasilver tetroxide was added, the rate of decay was
      unexpectedly lengthened, such that 0.12 ppm of ozone was present
      after 18 hours (approximately an order of magnitude higher than
      would have been expected in the absence of tetrasilver tetroxide)
      and by 24 hours, 0.03 ppm of ozone oxidizing activity was still
      present.<br>
      <br>
      Further research showed that neither tetrasilver tetroxide alone
      nor chemically-activated tetrasilver tetroxide (i. e., activated
      with potassium monopersulfate as described in the Comparative
      Examples) gave measurable oxidation as measured by the indigo dye
      method. Thus, the reduced half-life of ozone in the presence of
      tetrasilver tetroxide does not appear to be merely an additive
      effect or an experimental flaw arising from the use of the indigo
      dye method, but rather appears to be a surprising synergistic
      effect. </blockquote>

      <b>Molecular Crystal Device for Pharmaceuticals</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote><br>
      <b>Abstract ~</b> A novel molecular scale device is described
      which is bactericidal, fungicidal, viricidal and algicidal. The
      anti-pathogenic properties of the device are attributed to
      electron activity indigenous to diamagnetic semiconducting
      crystals of tetrasilver tetroxide ( Ag4O4 ) which contains two
      monovalent and two trivalent silver ions in each molecular
      crystal. When the crystals are activated with an oxidizing agent,
      they release electrons equivalent to 6.4 x 10-19 watts per
      molecule which in effect electrocute pathogens. A multitude of
      these devices are effective at such low concentrations as 0.3 PPM
      used as preservatives in a variety of formulations ranging from
      cosmetics to pharmaceuticals. Indeed, they are intended as active
      ingredients for pharmaceuticals formulated to destroy such
      pathogens as Staphylococcus aureus, and epidermidis, the latter of
      which it completely destroys in a nutrient broth culture of about
      1 million organisms at 0.6 PPM, or Candida albercans, the vaginal
      yeast infection at 2.5 PPM, and the AIDS virus at 18 PPM. <br>
      <br>
      The electron transfer can be depicted by the following half
      reactions in which the monovalent silver ion loses an electron and
      the trivalent silver gains one as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Ag+ -e = Ag+2<br>
      <br>
      Ag+3 +e = Ag+2<br>
      <br>
      The molecular crystal then will become stabilized with each silver
      ion having a divalent charge.<br>
      <br>
      Stringent testing was performed in which cultures were actually
      placed in trypticase soy nutrient broth, which allowed the
      pathogens being tested to replicate without being detached from
      its own food supply. Under these conditions the devices were able
      to kill two strains of E. Coli at 2.5 PPM; Micrococcus Luteus at
      1.25 PPM; Staphylococcus aureus at 2.5 PPM; Staphylococcus
      epidermidis at 0.6 PPM; Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1.25 PPM; and
      Streptococcus pyogenes at 2.5 PPM.<br>
      <br>
      The devices were then evaluated in analogous nutrient used for
      yeasts, algae and molds utilizing Sabouraud dextrose broth. The
      infectious yeast pathogen Candida ALBICANS was totally killed at
      2.5 PPM and that of the Saccharomycetpideae variety at 1.25 PPM.<br>
      <br>
      If we are to consider one molecular device in operation, then each
      molecule would release two electrons having each a charge of 4.8 x
      10-10 e.s.u. equivalent to approximately 1.6 x 10-19 coulombs. The
      EMF given in my Encyclopedia of Chemical Electrode Potentials
      (Plenum 1982), page 88, for the oxidation of Ag(I) to Ag(II) is
      1.98 volts which approximates 2.0 V. The total power output per
      device can be calculated in watts by multiplying the power output
      for each electron by 2. Since power is the product of the
      potential times the charge, P = EI; for each electron it would be<br>

      device are attributed to electron activity indigenous to
      diamagnetic semiconducting crystals of tetrasilver tetroxide
      (Ag4O4) which contains two monovalent and two trivalent silver
      ions in each molecular crystal. When the crystals are activated
      with an oxidizing agent, they release electrons equivalent to 6.4
      x 10-19 watts per molecule which in effect electrocute pathogens.
      A multitude of these devices are effective at such low
      concentrations as 0.3 PPM where they can kill 100% of 100 K/cc
      Streptococcus faecalis, and E. coli colonies in three minutes
      meeting the ten-minute EPA criteria of 100% kills within ten
      minutes for swimming pool and hot-tub applications. The devices
      can be used in utilitarian bodies of water, such as municipal and
      industrial water reservoirs. <br>
      <br>
      While the formula AgO accurately designates the silver:oxygen
      ratio, the molecular weight of the compound is actually 495.52.
      Further elucidation of the molecule's electromagnetic properties
      revealed that it is a diamagnetic semiconductor. The structure is
      electronically active because of the trivalent sp2 electron
      configuration disparity of the electrons within the crystal. The
      oxide as presented in my patent was actually capable of killing
      100% of standardized E. coli and Strep. faecalis colonies in less
      than five minutes at concentratiors of 0.5 PPM. My independent
      evaluations of this oxide in areas unrelated to water treatment
      resulted in the "molecular device" concept which was substantiated
      by submission of the oxide for testing with a preferred embodiment
      of the invention (10 PPM of sodium persulfate) at an Environmental
      Protection Agency (EPA) certified laboratory which revealed that
      0.5 PPM of oxide only yielded 0.003 PPM of silver in solution, a
      silver concentration entirely too low to cause this level of
      bactericidal activity. Indeed, the killing of the bacteria was
      analogous to that obtained by electron generating devices utilized
      in swimming pools or water towers for killing bacteria. It was
      therefore postulated that the oxide efficacy at low concentrations
      could only be attributed to regarding each oxide molecule as a
      device. Further testing was continued on algae and viruses. The
      accumulated data of efficacy at low concentrations, coupled
      together with a reinterpretation of silver oxide efficacy, has led
      to the final development of this invention, namely, a molecular
      device for killing algae, bacteria and viruses in utilitarian
      water bodies, such as swimming pools. <br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a molecular scale device capable of
      destroying gram positive and gram negative bacteria as well as
      viruses and algae. Said molecular scale device consists of a
      single crystal of tetrasilver tetroxide. Several hundred thousand
      trillion of these devices may be employed in concert for their
      bactericidal, viricidal, and algicidal properties and applied to
      industrial cooling towers, swimming pools, hot tubs, and municipal
      water supplies. <br>
      <br>
      The molecular crystals which are the subject of this invention are
      commercially available and can be prepared by reacting silver
      nitrate with sodium or potassium peroxydisulfate according to the
      following equation:</blockquote>
    <blockquote style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: center"><b>4AgNO3
        + 2Na2 S2 O8 + 8NaOH = Ag4O4 + 4Na2SO4 + 4NaNO3 + 4H2O</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote><br>
      The oxide lattice represented by the formula Ag4O4 is depicted in
      the Drawing FIG. 1. It is a semiconducting electron active
      diamagnetic crystal containing two monovalent and two trivalent
      silver ions in combination with four oxygen atoms. The distance
      between the Ag(III)-O Ag(I)O units equals 2.1 A. Ag(III)-Ag(III) =
      Ag(I)-Ag(I) = 3.28A and Ag(I)-Ag(III) = 3.19 A. Each trivalent
      silver ion is coordinated via dsp2 electron bonds to 4 oxygen
      atoms. The depiction of this lattice is based on several
      literature references relating to crystallographic studies.
      Exemplary of this literature are J. A. McMillan's studies
      appearing in Inorganic Chemistry 13,28 (1960); Nature vol. 195 No.
      4841 (1962), and Chemical Reviews 1962, 62,65. Alvin J. Salkind
      elucidated studies involving neutron diffraction with his
      coworkers (J. Ricerca Sci. 30, 1034 1960) proving the
      Ag(III)/Ag(I) nature of this molecule and states in his classic
      entitled Alkaline Storage Batteries (Wiley 1969), coauthored with
      S. Uno Falk, that the formula is depicted by Ag4O4&nbsp; (page
      156).<br>
      <br>
      That same year a scientific communication appeared in Inorganic
      Nuclear Chemistry Letters (5,337) authored by J. Servian and H.
      Buenafama which maintained that their neutron diffraction studies
      also confirmed the tetroxide lattice and the presence cf Ag(III)
      and Ag(I) bonds in the lattice, a conclusion also reported
      previously by Naray-Szahn and Argay as a result of their x-ray
      diffraction studies (Acta Cryst. 1965, 19,180). Thus the effects
      of this invention can be explained in terms of these structural
      elucidations, namely, that the single molecular semiconductor
      crystal which inevitably must be electronically active exchanging
      two electrons per crystals between its mono and trivalent bonds is
      in reality a device which kills pathogens in the same manner as
      electrically active large-scale devices utilized in water
      supplies.<br>
      <br>
      When the tetroxide crystals are utilized to destroy pathogens,
      they will not do so unless activated by an oxidizing agent. This
      is analogous to the behavior of single semiconducting photovoltaic
      molecular devices such as copper indium selenide whose surfaces
      must be "etched" in order to activate the photovoltaic activity,
      i.e., for light to facilitate the release of electrons from the
      molecule. The tetroxide was activated by persulfates [ or:
      hydrogen peroxide ]. It was found that when the persulfates were
      tested as a control by themselves, they failed to exhibit any
      unilateral antipathogenic activity at the optimum level selected
      of 10 PPM. The persulfates evaluated varied from OXONE (Registered
      Trademark Du Pont Company) brand potassium monopersulfate to
      alkali peroxydisulfates. <br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <br>
      Tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag4O4 ) crystals were prepared by modifying
      the procedure described by Hammer and Kleinberg in Inorganic
      Syntheses (IV,12). <br>
      <br>
      A stock solution was prepared by dissolving 24.0 grams of
      potassium peroxydisulfate in distilled water and subsequently
      adding to this 24.0 of sodium hydroxide and then diluting the
      entire solution with said water to a final volume of 500 ml. Into
      20 ml. vials were weighed aliquots of silver nitrate containing
      1.0 g. of silver. Now 50 ml. of the aforementioned stock solution
      were heated in a 100 ml. beaker, and the contents of one of the
      vials was added to the solution upon attaining a temperature of
      85.degree. C. The beaker was then maintained at 90.degree. C. for
      15 minutes. The resulting deep black oxide obtained consisting of
      molecular crystal devices was washed and decanted four times with
      distilled water in order to remove impurities. <br>
      <br>
      The purified material was collected for further evaluation and
      comparison with commercial material. <br>
      <br>
      The commercial material was purchased from Johnson Matthey's
      Catalog Chemicals Division of the Aesar Group of Ward Hill,
      Massachusetts, under product code 11607 and generically listed in
      its materials Safety Data Sheet as both silver peroxide and silver
      suboxide, having a purity of 99.9%.<br>
      <br>
      Both the prepared and commercial device crystals were submitted
      for bactericidal evaluation following "good laboratory practice"
      regulations as set forth in Federal Regulations (FIFRA and
      ffdca/40 CFR 160, May 2, 1984). The protocols consisted of
      exposures to Streptococcus faecalis, a gram positive pathogenic
      bacillus utilizing AOAC (15th) 1990:965:13: at colony densities of
      100 000 colonies/cc. and two exposure times of five and ten
      minutes. The devices were tested at concentrations of 0.3, 0.5 and
      1.0 PPM in distilled water adjusted to pH = 7.5 and containing
      Oxone (Registered Trademark Du Pont Company), which is potassium
      monopersulfate at a level of 10 PPM. The evaluations were repeated
      at the same persulfate concentration utilizing commercial grade
      sodium persulfate manufactured by FMC. 100% kills were actually
      obtained after three minutes at all the aforementioned device
      concentrations, there being actually zero colonies at the 0.5 and
      1.0 PPM levels after five minutes and at the 0.3 PPM level after
      ten minutes. Analogous testing employing the same colony density
      of the gram negative bacillus E. coli were carried out. The same
      results were obtained. EPA criteria require that 100% kills be
      obtained within ten minutes for a substance to meet EPA criteria
      for swimming pool utilizatior. In this case, the devices at 0.3
      PPM, equivalent to approximately 360,000 trillion devices, were
      able to far exceed EPA criteria for sanitizing a swimming pool. </blockquote>

      In this paper, it was reported that the effects of the electron

      antimicrobials than Ag (I) compounds, they pale by comparison to
      the tetroxide and so does colloidal silver that derives its

      </b>The diamagnetic semiconducting molecular crystal tetrasilver
      tetroxide ( Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4 </sub>) is utilized for
      destroying the AIDS virus, destroying AIDS synergistic pathogens

      trigger a redox chelation mechanism resulting in divalent silver
      moieties which chelate and bind active sites of the entities
      destroying them. The devices are completely non-toxic. However,
      they put stress on the liver causing hepatomegaly, but there is no

      intravenous injection will completely obliterate acquired immune
      deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans. Furthermore, said devices
      are capable of killing pathogens and purging the bloodstream of
      immune suppressing moieties (ISM) whether or not created by the
      AIDS virus (HIV); so as to restore the immune system. </blockquote>

    <blockquote>Another object of this invention is to destroy the AIDS

    <blockquote><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This invention relates to a molecular scale device not
      only capable of de33stroying the AIDS virus, but of purging the
      human bloodstream of pathogens and restoring immunity to AIDS
      patients of the candidiasis and wasting syndrome categories. Said
      molecular device consists of a single crystal of tetrasilver
      tetroxide (Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). The crystal lattice of
      this molecule has a unique structure since it is a diamagnetic
      semiconducting crystal containing two mono and two trivalent
      silver ions, which in effect are capable of "firing" electrons
      under certain conditions which will destroy AIDS viruses, other
      pathogens and immune suppressing moieties (ISM), not only through
      the electrocution mode, but also by a binding process which occurs
      simultaneously with electron firing, namely, binding and chelation
      of divalent silver, i.e., the resulting product of the electron
      transfer redox that occur when the monovalent silver ions are
      oxidized and the trivalent ions are reduced in the crystal. The
      binding/chelation effect occurs at active sites of the AIDS virus,
      pathogens and ISM. Because of the extremely minute size of a
      single molecule of this crystal, several million of these devices
      may be employed in concert to destroy a virus colony to purge a
      life support system of ISM and pathogens with the consumption of
      only parts per trillion of the crystal devices. Thus an optimum of
      40 PPM of the devices by weight of human blood was found to be
      sufficient to completely obliterate AIDS. This concentration is
      slightly over double of the optimum concentration recommended in
      applicant's aforementioned U.S. patent for the destruction of the
      human AIDS virus in vitro. Other details concerning the structure
      of the crystal and its mechanism against pathogens, the AIDS virus
      and ISM would analogously hold here, and have already been further
      elucidated in said patent. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The actual destruction of pathogens, ISM and the AIDS
      virus is effectuated by injection of a suspension of these devices
      in distilled or deionized water with a non-reacting electrolyte
      directly, i.e. intravenously, into the bloodstream. A single
      injection is all that is required under these conditions.
      Accordingly, humans injected in this manner, upon being inspected
      after three weeks or more had elapsed and compared with similar
      humans that had been given placebos, were completely cured of
      AIDS. The control group still manifested AIDS. Accordingly, the
      tetrasilver tetroxide device performed in concert with and in full
      conformity with the ultimate objects of this invention.
      Furthermore, three out of four wasting syndrome terminal patients
      and four out of the five candidiasis terminal patients were still
      alive in 1995 after a year and a half had elapsed from their
      initial injection. By that time all the AIDS patients had been
      released from the clinic and allowed to return home. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Other objects and features of the present invention
      shall become apparent to those skilled in the art when the present
      invention is considered in view of the accompanying examples. It
      should, of course, be recognized that the accompanying examples
      illustrate preferred embodiments of the present invention and are
      not intended as a means of defining the limits and scope of the
      present invention. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 1 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Five patients afflicted with AIDS of the candidiasis
      etiological category were segregated for Tetrasil treatment. The
      rationale for selecting them was based on facts presented in an
      article by Peter H. Duesberg and Brian J. Ellison entitled "Is The
      AIDS Virus A Science Fiction?" (<i>Policy Review</i>, Summer 1990
      pp. 40-51). Only the factual presentations of the article were
      utilized and the hypothesis of the authors was ignored. The facts
      presented in the article related to the method of selecting AIDS
      patients based on the five aforementioned etiological subgroups
      targeted by the CDC, and the evidence presented, that there is
      AIDS without HIV as well as with it so that an anti-viral agent in
      most instances will not necessarily restore the immunity system. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Evaluations with Tetrasil were conducted on AIDS
      patients at Lucha Contra el Sida, Comayaguela, Honduras. The
      patients two weeks prior to inoculation were removed from their
      AZT, AIDS therapy. Tetrasil was administered at approximately 40
      PPM of blood volume per patient as a suspension in a proprietary
      buffer solution (pH = 6.5), supplied by Holipharm Corporation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The results of evaluations with candidiasis are
      tabulated in Table I under its disease category. All patients
      evaluated were terminal. Some, however, were in moderate (m)
      condition and others in poor (p) as designated in the Table. The I
      and F designations refer to initial and final values as shown. WBC
      indicates white cell blood count. The H column, following CD 8,
      indicates whether hepatomegaly occurred. This was an unfortunate
      consequence of the treatment which resulted in enlarged livers in
      all patients except the second one. Despite hepatomegaly, there
      was no interference with liver function. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The onset of hepatomegaly was not spontaneous and varied
      from patient to patient, being in the range of 4-16 days. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It should also be noted that shortly after injection of
      Tetrasil there were indications of fever (symbolized by T in the
      Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> column), sometimes accompanied by
      fatigue (F). The body temperature was invariably 38.5.degree. C.
      (101.3.degree. F.). This was indicative of restoration of the
      immune response of the body, since normally the body will destroy
      pathogens when the immune system is functional by raising the
      temperature. The patient who died; first responded favorably to
      Diflucan, which previously gave no response. He was cured of his
      candidiasis, but unfortunately succumbed to his previous body
      damage. All the other candidiasis syndrome people who previously
      did not respond to the indicated medications subsequently
      responded after the Tetrasil treatment. Further evidence of the
      recovery of the AIDS patients manifested itself 30 days after the
      initial injection when white blood cell counts were taken. They
      are shown in Table I under the WBC column, which gives the initial
      and final WBC. All candidiasis patients showed a dramatic increase
      in their white blood cell counts, indicative of the restoration of
      their immunity systems. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 2 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The above protocol of Example 1 was repeated with AIDS
      patients exhibiting wasting syndrome. The results of their
      treatment are tabulated in Table I under the disease category of
      said syndrome. It should be noted that two of the four wasting
      syndrome patients showed improved white blood counts. The female
      patient, whose condition improved from poor and terminal to be
      among the living, showed a decrease in the WBC. However, she
      showed an increase in body temperature which was indicative of
      immune response. The test results indicate that one cannot rely on
      a single factor to indicate the demise of AIDS. The usual HIV
      marker CD 4 initial and final are irrelevant. ISM suppression
      appears to be more critical than the destruction of HIV. AIDS was
      suppressed, any permanent damage that had been done to the
      patients in the course of their succumbing to AIDS was not
      obviously cured or corrected by said crystal device treatment,
      rather said injury persisted and the patient was improved with
      respect to AIDS but still suffered from said permanent injury or
      impairment previously inflicted. </blockquote>

      No. 07/971,933, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,336,499 and is incorporated
      herein by reference. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The crystal lattice of the Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
      device operates by transferring electrons from its two monovalent
      silver ions to the two trivalent silver ions in the crystal in
      aqueous media in which it is immersed, and which conducts
      electrons, contributing to the death of pathogens by traversing
      the cell membrane surface of the pathogens being "electrocuted",
      not only by these electrons but also by others emanating from
      other molecular devices in the vicinity of the pathogen. The
      device is attracted to the cell membrane surface by powerful
      covalent bonding forces caused by the well-known affinity of
      silver to certain elements present in the membrane, such as sulfur
      and nitrogen. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The electron transfer can be depicted by the following
      redox half reactions in which the monovalent silver ion loses an
      electron and the trivalent silver gains one as follows: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ag<sup>+</sup> -e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Ag<sup>+3</sup> +e = Ag<sup>+2</sup> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The molecular crystal then will become stabilized with
      each silver ion having a divalent charge. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Stringent testing was performed in which cultures were
      actually placed in trypticase soy nutrient broth, which allowed
      the pathogens being tested to replicate without being detached
      from its own food supply. Under these conditions the devices were
      able to kill two strains of E. coli at 2.5 PPM; Micrococcus luteus
      at 1.25 PPM; Staphylococcus aureus at 2.5 PPM; Staphylococcus
      epidermidis at 0.6 PPM; Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1.25 PPM; and
      Streptococcus pyogenes at 2.5 PPM. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The devices were then evaluated in analogous nutrient
      used for yeasts, algae and molds utilizing Sabouraud dextrose
      broth. The infectious yeast pathogen Candida albicans was totally
      killed at 2.5 PPM and that of the Saccharomycetpideae variety at
      1.25 PPM. These were also evaluated successfully in mice against
      murine aids, and in humans against Candida albicans both as a
      douche and intravenously. The devices also were successful
      externally in humans against Staphylcoccus epidermidis, nail
      fungus and athlete's foot. Intravenous injections completely cured
      subjects who were suffering from acute diarrhea of ameobic
      dysentery. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It was found that oxidizing agents, particularly
      persulfates, enhance the efficacy of said devices. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 1 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The molecular crystal devices were tested as to whether
      they could kill pathogenic microorganisms with the intent of
      utilizing them in pharmaceutical applications. Once it could be
      determined that the devices inhibited a particular microorganism,
      the minimal concentration required of the Ag<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
      molecular crystal devices was determined to inhibit the
      microorganism in nutrient broth. One family of pathogens that are
      known for their deleterious effects on humans are popularly called
      "staph" infections. These infections are commonly contracted in
      hospitals having lax infectious screening procedures. Accordingly,
      three staph strains were selected as follows for evaluation:
      Staphylococcus aureus 9027, 27543 and Staphylococcus epidermidis
      12228. The inoculum nutrient broth was prepared according to AOAC
      specifications so as to contain 0.6-1 million organisms per drop
      of inoculum, each drop being equal to 0.05 ml. The broth itself
      was trypticase soy broth BBL 11766 prepared according to label
      instructions. Accordingly, the broth was prestandardized for the
      microorganisms in question in order to assure that the number of
      organisms remained constant within the margins of statistical
      allowance during the test period. Having carried out the
      procedures with 0.05 ml. of inoculum and having incubated the
      organisms for 24 hours at 34.degree.-35.degree. C., it was found
      that staph organism 9027 was inhibited at 2.5 PPM; number 27543 at
      5.0 PPM; and the 2228 organism at 0.625 PPM all in the presence of
      10 PPM sodium persulfate. This data was utilized to formulate a
      dermatological cream which would contain 100 PPM sodium persulfate
      and 10 PPM of device crystals to inhibit staph infections. The
      cream was applied to a "staph" infection. The infection
      disappeared overnight. The subject was a 24-year old female. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 2 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The procedures described in Example 1 were analogously
      followed for the yeast pathogen Candida albicans using strain
      16464 excepting that the nutrient broth was changed to accommodate
      this yeast pathogen to Sabouraud dextrose broth (Difco 038217-9).
      It was found that 2.5 PPM of molecular crystal devices completely
      inhibited the growth of this gynecological yeast infection. A
      gynecological cream and a douche were formulated against yeasts
      based on the results. The douche which contained 10 PPM of
      crystals and 40 PPM sodium persulfate was self-administered by a
      woman in her thirties who had suffered an entire year from the
      infection and who had taken virtually every prescription medicine
      for the infection to no avail. After taking two 2-quart douches
      within 24 hours, all signs of the candida infection had
      disappeared and her doctor pronounced her completely cured. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 3 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Device crystals were administered intravenously into a
      person in such a manner as to give a concentration of said
      tetroxide crystals of 40 PPM in the bloodstream. The person was
      chronically ill from Candida albicans. The subject, a citizen and
      resident of Honduras, was a 33-year old female. She was completely
      cured within a month of taking the crystals intravenously. It
      should be noted that the subject was close to death as a
      consequence of exposure to the disease prior to the aforesaid
      treatment. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 4 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Two patients at the same clinic where Example 3 patient
      was treated, in San Pedro Sultas, Honduras, were suffering from
      acute ameobic dysentery with diarrhea and dehydration. They were
      similarly intravenously treated to a level of 40 PPM of the
      crystals. Both patients, one a 19-year old male, and the other a
      62-year old male, after being given one injection started to show
      slight improvement after one week. After one month had elapsed,
      they were completely cured from their condition. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The human dosages of this and the previous example were
      known to be safe as they were pretested in mice by injecting them
      with said crystal devices. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 5 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Six C57BL mice were selected that were six months old.
      One mouse was untreated as a control. Another control mouse was
      treated with an intravenous injection via its tail with 0.1 ml. of
      tetrasilver tetroxide devices calculated to contain 40 PPM in the
      bloodstream of the mouse. Two more control mice were now infected
      with MAIDS virus designated culture LP-BM5. Two test mice were
      then infected with culture LP-BM5. The LP-BM5 culture infection
      was achieved with intra-peritoneal injections of 0.4 ml. of said
      viral suspension. Subsequent to these vital injections the test
      mice were injected intravenously with 0.1 ml. (through the tail)
      of the 40 PPM (0.08 mg.) tetrasilver tetroxide devices. The
      devices in each case were suspended in distilled water for 3 days
      prior to injection and conditioned with sodium acetate as the
      electrolyte of choice. After 4 weeks had elapsed, the untreated
      and device treated control mice were killed. The untreated control
      mouse had a spleen weight of 90 mg., and the device treated mouse
      that of 89 mg. Both mice were seen to be in perfect health. After
      3.5 weeks had elapsed, one of the infected control mice was killed
      and showed signs of MAIDS infection with a spleen weight of 138
      mg. After 4 weeks had elapsed, the second infected control mouse
      was killed. It too showed signs of MAIDS infection with a spleen
      weight of 158 mg. As for the test mice, the vital suspension
      injection was injected immediately prior to the silver device
      treatment. They were then killed after 4 weeks. Both mice showed
      no signs of MAIDS infection, and their spleens weighed 103 and 95
      mg., respectively, which are normal weights for these mice, whose
      body weight varies between 15-30 g. and whose blood volume is
      approximately 2.0 ml. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 6 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A 29-year old male suffering from athlete's foot soaked
      his feet in a solution containing 100 PPM of the crystal devices.
      The subject was completely cured within 24 hours. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>EXAMPLE 7 </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A 61-year old male who suffered from a toenail fungus
      was treated with a 25% suspension of said crystal devices. The
      nail fungus, which had bothered the subject for three years, was
      gone after a week. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>While there is shown and described herein certain
      specific examples embodying the invention, it will be manifest to
      those skilled in the art that various modifications and
      rearrangements of the invention may be made without departing from

      <br>
      According to two kinds of fungicide mechanism of action: &#9312; by
      interfering with the respiratory process of germs, inhibit the
      production of energy to kill bacteria. &#9313; interfere with microbial
      life substances such as proteins, nucleic acids, alcohols and
      other biosynthesis to kill bacteria. Tetraoxide silver tetraoxide
      prepared four silver fungicides as fungicides belong to the second
      type of mechanism of action. The mechanism of Ag4O4 was analyzed.
      The antibacterial order of Ag4O4 was: Ag &lt;3 +&gt; Ag &lt;2
      +&gt; Ag &lt;1+&gt;, and Ag4O4 was a kind of Ag4O4 with A unique
      conformation of "multivalent silver" oxide that redox reactions
      with exposed 2N and 2S groups on the protein surface produces
      electrical kill and chelation that result in altered protein
      conformation. Its mechanism of action is different from the
      general antimicrobial agents, the mode of action is not easy to
      cause the pathogen resistance or mutation, no toxicity to normal
      tissues, with anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory cells.<br>
      <br>

      function of preventing biosynthesis of bacterial cells, especially
      bacteria and viruses, and antimicrobial plastic products,
      antimicrobial fiber products, antibacterial fabrics , Against
      various pathogenic microorganisms caused by plant diseases,
      medical equipment and reagent additives, antibacterial coatings
      and antibacterial ware widely used in these fields, with good
      inhibition of bacteria, viruses, the preparation method of the
      present invention is simple, suitable for large Scale industrial

          The diamagnetic semiconducting molecular crystal tetrasilver
          tetroxide (Ag4O4) is utilized for destroying the AIDS virus,
          destroying AIDS synergistic pathogens and immunity suppressing
          moieties (ISM) in humans. A single intravenous injection of
          the devices is all that is required for efficacy at levels of
          about 40 PPM of human blood. The device molecular crystal
          contains two mono and two trivalent silver ions capable of
          "firing" electrons capable of electrocuting the AIDS virus,
          pathogens and ISM. When administered into the bloodstream, the
          device electrons will be triggered by pathogens, a
          proliferating virus and ISM, and when fired will
          simultaneously trigger a redox chelation mechanism resulting
          in divalent silver moieties which chelate and bind active
          sites of the entities destroying them. The devices are
          completely non-toxic.; However, they put stress on the liver
          causing hepatomegaly, but there is no loss of liver function.

          multivalent silver compounds that have been exposed to ozone,
          and more particularly to aqueous solutions containing
          ozone-activated tetrasilver tetroxide. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><b>BACKGROUND OF THE
          INVENTION</b></strong><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal"> </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">It is conventionally understood that water,
          particularly standing bodies of water, can be an effective
          breeding ground or reservoir for a variety of undesirable
          microbes. Thus, a wide variety of water treatment systems have
          been developed to disinfect potable water and/or maintain it
          at a safe level. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Perhaps the most common disinfection method for
          drinking or recreational water is chlorination. However, it
          has been found that chlorine has an objectionable odor, and
          can cause skin irritations and serious eye irritations to
          users of recreational bodies of water, such as pools, spas,
          etc. More importantly, chlorine forms trihalomethanes in the
          presence of organic materials and these compounds present a
          potential health threat due to their carcinogenicity and
          mutagenicity. Because of the long term health threat and
          objectionable physical properties of chlorine, a number of
          alternate water treatment systems that operate without
          chlorine have been developed in recent years. </span></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Another gas used to disinfect water is ozone.
          According to U. S. Patent No. 4,176,061 to Stopka, the ability
          of ozone to purify drinking water has been appreciated for
          some time. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Stopka cites a number of references that teach the
          advantages of using ozone rather than chlorine to
          decontaminate water. What Stopka does not disclose is that
          ozone, like chlorine, has some disadvantages. Perhaps most
          significant of these disadvantages is that ozone, as a gas,
          can dissipate from water over time, leaving the water once
          again susceptible to contamination by various pathogens. </span></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">A number of water disinfection systems rely on the
          oligodynamic effect provided by the addition to water of, e.
          g., transition metals such as silver. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">For example, U. S. Patent No. 4,608,247 to Heinig, Jr.
          discloses water treatment systems comprising exposing the
          water to a material which erodes to provide particulate silver
          in the water. Although the particulate silver is said to be
          ionic, and the patent does not disclose the valency of the
          ions formed by erosion, other references, such as
          Antelman,"Silver (II, III)
          Disinfectants,"Soap/Cosmetics/Chemical Specialties, pp. 52-59
          (March 1994) at page 52, third paragraph, suggest that trace
          ions formed from silver metal are monovalent. </span></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">U. S. Patent No. 5,352,369 to Heinig, Jr. acknowledges
          that water treatment systems like that disclosed in Heinig's
          earlier 247 patent are only partially effective in avoiding
          the use of chlorine as an antimicrobial agent, in that such
          systems often require the addition of reduced amounts of
          chlorine to water treated by such systems. The 369 patent
          purports to avoid this limitation on prior silver-based
          systems, in providing a method of treating water by generating
          an active oxidizer in the water which is capable of attacking
          and killing a wide range of microorganisms therein. The method
          comprises exposing the water to a silver catalyst in the
          presence of oxygen to form an active oxidizer in the water
          and, in some instances to also release silver ions (presumably
          monovalent silver ions as discussed above) therein via an
          erosion process similar to that set forth in Heinig's 247
          patent. The silver catalyst utilized in the method comprises
          an alumina matrix having between approximately 0.1% and 5% by
          weight of elemental silver chemically deposited thereon. The
          oxygen utilized in the method preferably also comprises ozone.

    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">The inventor has discovered that the ozonated form of
          the compound tetrasilver tetroxide has an antimicrobial effect
          greater than that of non-oxidated tetrasilver tetroxide. Prior
          to the inventor's discovery, it was known that potassium
          monopersulfate could activate the antimicrobial effect of
          tetrasilver tetroxide, but the inventor is unaware of any
          suggestion in the prior art that ozone is also capable of
          activating this effect. In embodiments of the invention,
          ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide has an antimicrobial effect at
          least equal to that of potassium monopersulfate-activated
          tetrasilver tetroxide. Moreover, activating tetrasilver
          tetroxide with ozone avoids the drawbacks of using potentially
          hazardous and/or toxic chemicals as activation agents. </span></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Although there has been some confusion in the art
          regarding the precise nature of tetrasilver tetroxide, U. S.
          Patent No. 5,211,855 describes tetrasilver tetroxide as a
          molecule, Ag404, having one pair of monovalent silver atoms
          and one pair of trivalent silver atoms. While not necessarily
          wishing to be bound by this theory in its entirety, the
          term"tetrasilver tetroxide"as used herein is intended to
          identify the compound Ag404. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Tetrasilver tetroxide is the most preferred
          oligodynamic compound of the invention; however, it is
          contemplated that the other oligodynamic compounds, such as
          trivalent silver (see, e. g., U. S. Patent No. 5,223,149 to
          Antelman), multivalent copper (see, e. g., U. S. Patent No.
          5,336,416 to Antelman), and other multivalent heavy metal
          compounds, can be substituted for tetrasilver tetroxide in
          certain embodiments of the invention. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Tetrasilver tetroxide is ozonated by a process
          comprising providing non-activated tetrasilver tetroxide and
          ozone in a fluid medium. The medium can be ozonated before,
          during and/or after addition of tetrasilver tetroxide thereto.
          Water is the preferred fluid medium, but other liquid or
          gaseous media in which ozone can be solubilized can be
          suitable for use in the invention, e. g., various peroxides,
          ethers, alcohols or acids, such as peracetic acid. </span></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">The initial ratio of ozone to tetrasilver tetroxide
          provided in the medium is preferably 1: 10 to 10: 1, more
          preferably at least 1: 2, most preferably at least 1: 1. The
          amount of ozone is preferably from 0.5 to 7.0 ppm, and more
          preferably from 4 to 6 ppm. The concentration of non-activated
          tetrasilver tetroxide is preferably from 0.5 to 7.0 ppm, and
          more preferably from 2 to 6 ppm. Greater amounts of either
          ingredient might be wasteful or cause undesirable side
          effects. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Lesser amounts of either ingredient might not be
          sufficiently microcidal to achieve a desired antimicrobial
          effect. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Although it is preferred to initially provide ozone in
          the above-identified concentrations, such concentrations need
          not be maintained throughout the life of the resulting
          composition. In embodiments, ozone is actively removed or
          passively dissipates from the composition over time, yielding
          a composition substantially devoid of ozone in which
          ozone-activated tetrasilver tetroxide continues to function as
          an antimicrobial agent. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">In view of the heretofore unknown ability of ozone to
          activate tetrasilver tetroxide, it is not necessary to provide
          other activating agents in the composition, such as potassium
          monopersulfate. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Compositions of the invention are suitable for a wide
          variety of purposes. For example, the compositions can be
          consumed as beverages (e. g., as bottled water, municipal tap
          water, etc.) or can be applied as cleaning agents to
          substrates in need of cleaning (i. e., disinfection, etc.).
          The concentration of tetrasilver tetroxide and/or ozone may be
          adjusted according to the intended use. For example, the
          concentration of at least one ingredient might be raised above
          the preferred concentrations mentioned above to prepare a
          disinfectant composition unsuitable for human consumption. Of
          course, such a composition would preferably be packaged in a
          container labeled as a cleaning product so as to avoid
          accidental human consumption. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Water disinfection is the most preferred use for
          ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide of the invention. water
          disinfection according to the invention can be as simple as
          providing ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide in water. This can be
          done in accordance with the methods described above for
          providing ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide compositions. The
          water decontaminated can be used for consumption (e. g., via
          municipal water distribution systems), recreation (e. g., in
          pools), manufacturing (e. g., as a raw material, solvent,
          etc.), etc. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">The water disinfection method of the invention enjoys
          several advantages over conventional water treatment methods
          employing ozone without tetrasilver tetroxide or tetrasilver
          tetroxide without ozone. In addition to the unexpected
          activation of tetrasilver tetroxide by ozone described above,
          tetrasilver tetroxide has an unexpected effect on ozone. The
          inventor has discovered that the half-life of ozone in water
          is increased by tetrasilver tetroxide. As the dissipation of
          ozone from treated water over time and distance has posed a
          major limitation on the use of ozone in municipal water
          treatment, the ability of tetrasilver tetroxide to extend the
          half-life of ozone in water is a very significant advantage of
          the invention. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">The combined effects of ozone and tetrasilver
          tetroxide also facilitate the use of lesser amounts of at
          least one of the two ingredients relative to prior art methods
          using only one of the two ingredients. This can improve the
          quality of the product of the method (e. g., by minimizing the
          undesirable odor of ozone), while decreasing production costs.

          effects of: (a) a sixty-minute treatment with 2 ppm

          ppm ozone; and (c) a twenty-minute treatment with 0.3 ppm
          ozone and 2 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide. The tetrasilver
          tetroxide alone (a) was little more effective than the
          untreated control (d). Twenty minutes of ozone alone (b)
          produced a significant killing effect, but the combination of
          ozone and tetrasilver tetroxide (c) was much more potent than
          either compound alone. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Without wishing to be bound by any theories, it
          appears that in addition to acting as a killing agent in its
          own right, ozone is surprisingly able to activate the
          antimicrobial activity of tetrasilver tetroxide, thus yielding
          a synergistic killing effect exceeding the individual killing
          effects of either non-activated tetrasilver tetroxide or
          ozone. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Example 5: Ozone Stability Testing 6.1 mg/L (6.1 ppm)
          of ozone was provided in deionized, distilled water over a 15
          minute period. The solution was allowed to stand with stirring
          by a magnetic stirrer over a 24-hour period, taking periodic
          readings of the ozone concentration. By 2 hours, the ozone
          concentration was 3 ppm and progressively dropped to 0.01 ppm
          by 18 hours. This represented a half-life of approximately 2
          hours. When 2 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide was added, the rate of
          decay was unexpectedly lengthened, such that 0.12 ppm of ozone
          was present after 18 hours (approximately an order of
          magnitude higher than would have been expected in the absence
          of tetrasilver tetroxide) and by 24 hours, 0.03 ppm of ozone
          oxidizing activity was still present. </span></strong> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.79in"><strong><span style="font-weight:
          normal">Further research showed that neither tetrasilver
          tetroxide alone nor chemically-activated tetrasilver tetroxide
          (i. e., activated with potassium monopersulfate as described
          in the Comparative Examples) gave measurable oxidation as
          measured by the indigo dye method. Thus, the reduced half-life
          of ozone in the presence of tetrasilver tetroxide does not
          appear to be merely an additive effect or an experimental flaw
          arising from the use of the indigo dye method, but rather
          appears to be a surprising synergistic effect. </span></strong>
