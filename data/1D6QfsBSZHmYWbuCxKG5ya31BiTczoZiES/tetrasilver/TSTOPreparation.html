        <b>Silver (II) Oxide</b><br>
        <b>by</b><br>
        <b>Robert Hammer &amp; Jacob Kleiberg</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Silver (II) oxide has been made by the hydrolytic action of
      boiling water on a substance of the approximate formula Ag7O8NO3,
      a material which obtained by the electrolytic oxidation of silver
      (I) nitrate solutions (Ref. 1-4). A more rapid and convenient
      process for the preparation of this oxide involves the oxidation
      of silver (I) nitrate by means of potassium peroxydisulfate
      ("Oxone") in an alkaline medium (Ref. 5, 6).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Procedure</b><b><br>
      </b>72 grams of sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 1.8 mols) in pellet form
      is added portionwise, with constant stirring, to 1 liter of water,
      which is maintained at approximately 85°. Seventy-five (75) grams
      of potassium peroxydisulfate (0.28 mols) in the form of an aqueous
      slurry is added to the hot alkaline solution; this is followed by
      the addition of 51 gr of silver (I) nitrate (0.30 mol) dissolved
      in a minimum amount of water. The temperature of the resulting
      mixture is raised to 90°, and stirring is continued for
      approximately 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The precipitate of black silver (II) oxide is filtered on a large
      Buchner funnel, and sulfate ion is removed by washing with water
      which has been made slightly alkaline with sodium hydroxide. The
      product is air-dried.<br>
      <br>
      Yield, 35 gr (94%).<br>
      <br>
      Analysis: Calculated for AgO: Ag, 87.08%. Found: Ag, 86.93%,
      86.90% (by gravimetric chloride method, after dissolution of the
      product in 3N nitric acid).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Properties</b><b><br>
      </b>There are many indications that AgO is a true oxide, rather
      than a peroxide, and is, therefore, properly named silver (II)
      oxide. The compound does not give free hydrogen peroxide when
      acidified but behaves in a manner more characteristic of a
      compound in which the metal ion is present in a strongly oxidized
      valence state, which may be stabilized by coordination. In dilute
      acid, oxygen is immediately evolved; in concentrated acid,
      intensely colored solutions are formed (brown in nitric acid and
      olive green in sulfuric acid). These latter solutions are
      relatively stable, though they gradually decompose with an
      accompanying liberation of oxygen, and have been show to possess
      paramagnetism which is quantitatively consistent with the expected
      magnetic moment of the postulated silver (II) species (Ref. 7). In
      the solid state, this oxide is stable when heated to 100°, but it
      decomposes at higher temperatures. The solid possesses
      semiconductor properties and is diamagnetic. These phenomena have
      been explained by Neiding and Kazarnovskii (Ref. 7) on the
      assumption that the silver is actually trivalent in its crystal
      lattice with both O-Ag and Ag-Ag bonds. The difference in the
      specific volumes of AgO and Ag2O is less than would be expected if
      AgO were a peroxide (Ref 7). Equilibrium of silver (II) oxide with
      dilute nitric acid gives the black paramagnetic oxynitrate
      (Ag7O8NO3), a substance in which part of the silver is apparently
      in the tripositive state.<br>

          PREPARATION OF TETRASILVER TETROXIDE</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Oxidation of silver to its +3 oxidation state</b><b><br>
      </b>Prepare a solution of silver nitrate or silver oxide in dilute
      nitric acid. Any concentration of 1 to 2 mol/l for the nitric acid
      is OK.<br>
      <br>
      Add some solid sodium persulfate to the liquid. Adding a fairly
      concentrated solution of sodium persulfate also works. When this
      is done, then the liquid becomes brown and remains clear. The
      brown color is due to silver (III) ions. The brown color is formed
      quickly, although not instantaneously. It takes a few seconds.<br>
      <br>
      Silver (III) ions are not very stable. Even in the fairly strongly
      acidic liquids, the compound slowly decomposes. A black
      precipitate is formed and oxygen is released very slowly. This
      black precipitate is due to combined hydrolysis and reduction of
      the silver (III) ions. A mixed silver (I) silver (III) oxide is
      formed, which precipitates from the liquid as a black solid.<br>
      <br>
      Remarkably, when persulfate is added to a neutral solution of
      silver nitrate, then no brown color is formed. In that case the
      liquid first remains colorless, but in the course of a few minutes
      it slowly turns turbid and a dark brown/black precipitate is
      formed. Apparently, at higher pH, the brown silver (III) ion is
      not formed at all and the mixed silver (I) silver (III) oxide is
      formed immediately.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Addition of sodium hydroxide, quick formation of Ag(I)Ag(III)O2</b><b><br>
      </b>When the brown liquid is added to a solution of sodium
      hydroxide, then the process of formation of the black silver (I)
      silver (III) oxide is almost immediate. As soon as the brown
      liquid is added to a solution of sodium hydroxide, a dark brown
      very finely divided precipitate is formed. The solid particles
      stick together quickly and larger black particles are formed. The
      black solid slowly evolves oxygen and every few minutes it moves
      to the surface, due to many small bubbles of oxygen, which are
      trapped inside the precipitate. When these small bubbles of oxygen
      are lost, then the solid mass sinks to the bottom again. This
      'dance' is repeated several times.<br>
      <br>
      The three pictures below show the liquid, immediately after adding
      it to a slight excess amount of a solution of NaOH. The second
      picture shows the same liquid a few minutes later, when the
      particles of the precipitate stick to each other. The final
      picture shows the precipitate near the surface, due to lots of
      trapped bubbles of oxygen. All the pictures clearly show the
      bubbles of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Whether the brown color is due to plain Ag3+ or due to some mixed
      valency complex of silver (I) and silver (III) is not clear to me.
      It might be that the brown color is due to a mixed valency complex
      of silver (I) and silver (III). Examples of mixed valency
      complexes are also given on the following pages: copper (I) /
      copper (II) and titanium (III) / titanium (IV).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Reaction with silver</b><b><br>
      </b>In acidic media, persulfate is capable of oxidizing silver (I)
      ions to silver (III) ions. These silver (III) ions are brown.<br>
      <br>
      Ag+(aq) + S2O82-(aq) ? Ag3+(aq) + 2SO42-(aq)<br>
      <br>
      Silver (III) ions are not very stable. This liquid slowly looses
      its color and gives off oxygen. A black precipitate is formed of
      silver (I) silver (III) oxide. The silver (III) ions slowly
      oxidize the water, in which they are dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      4Ag3+ + 6H2O ? 2AgIAgIIIO2 + 12H+ + O2<br>
      <br>
      When the liquid is made more basic, then the reaction proceeds
      much faster, as the experiment demonstrates. The following
      reaction occurs in that case.<br>
      <br>
      4Ag3+ + 12OH– ? 2AgIAgIIIO2 + 6H2O + O2<br>
      <br>
      The compound AgAgO2 in turn also decomposes. It slowly looses
      oxygen and is converted to simple silver (I) oxide.<br>
      <br>
      2AgIAgIIIO2 ? 2AgI2O + O2<br>
      <br>
      <b>General remarks</b><b><br>
      </b>Both the silver (III) compounds and the NiO2 compound are very
      strong oxidizers. Both compounds are capable of oxidizing
      manganese (IV) and manganese (II) to the +7 oxidation state as
      permanganate and chromium (III) is oxidized to the +6 oxidation
      state as dichromate or chromate.<br>
      <br>
      Silver nitrate is a catalyst in many reactions with persulfate in
      acidic media. Persulfate is a strong oxidizer, but it also is
      somewhat sluggish. The reaction between silver (I) and persulfate
      in acidic media, however is quite fast. Silver (III) in turn
      reacts with manganese (II) or chromium (III) quickly to form
      permanganate or dichromate, itself being converted to silver (I)
      again. So, in the presence of a small amount of silver nitrate,
      the persulfate anion can be used as a fast and very strong
      oxidizer. The catalytic action of silver is based on the fact that
      an other pathway for the final redox reaction is provided, with
      Ag3+ as intermediate species.<br>
      <br>
      A similar catalytic action can be observed with nickel hydroxide
      in basic solutions. The reaction between nickel hydroxide and
      persulfate is very fast (instantaneously, at least in terms of
      human observation). Nickel (IV) oxide in turn is capable of
      oxidizing e.g. manganese (IV) oxide to permanganate. This property
      can be used as a sensitive method for detecting manganese.<br>
      <br>
      Another important remark is that in both experiments, the presence
      of chloride ions should be avoided. Especially with the silver
      experiment, chloride ions are really disturbing. They make the
      liquid cloudy, due to formation of silver (I) chloride and they
      interfere, due to oxidation to chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      For the nickel experiment the presence of chloride is not of a
      direct concern, but if one wants to use NiO2 for detection of
      manganese by conversion to the deep purple permanganate, then even
      small amounts of chloride interfere and make the detection fail.<br>

      (III) chemistry can be found in the following book: Chemistry of

      "Tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag4O4 ) crystals were prepared by
      modifying the procedure described by Hammer and Kleinberg in
      Inorganic Syntheses (IV,12). A stock solution was prepared by
      dissolving 24.0 grams of potassium peroxydisulfate in distilled
      water and subsequently adding to this 24.0 of sodium hydroxide and
      then diluting the entire solution with said water to a final
      volume of 500 ml. Into 20 ml. vials were weighed aliquots of
      silver nitrate containing 1.0 g. of silver. Now 50 ml. of the
      aforementioned stock solution were heated in a 100 ml. beaker, and
      the contents of one of the vials was added to the solution upon
      attaining a temperature of 85.degree. C. The beaker was then
      maintained at 90.degree. C. for 15 minutes. The resulting deep
      black oxide obtained consisting of molecular crystal devices was
      washed and decanted four times with distilled water in order to
      remove impurities. The purified material was collected for further
      evaluation and comparison with commercial material. The commercial
      material was purchased from Johnson Matthey's Catalog Chemicals

      <br>
      Potassium peroxymonosulfate (also known as MPS, potassium
      monopersulfate, and the trade names Caroat and Oxone) is widely
      used as an oxidizing agent. It is the potassium salt of
      peroxymonosulfuric acid.<br>
      <br>
      The potassium salt is marketed by two companies: Evonik (formerly
      Degussa) under the tradename Caroat and DuPont under the tradename
      Oxone, tradenames which are now part of standard chemistry
      vocabulary. It is a component of a triple salt with the formula
      2KHSO5·KHSO4·K2SO4.[1] The standard electrode potential for this
      compound is +1.44 V with a half reaction generating the hydrogen
      sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      HSO5- + 2 H+ + 2 e- ? HSO4- + H2O<br>
      <br>
      Reactions<br>
      Oxone is a versatile oxidant. It oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic
      acids; in the presence of alcoholic solvents, the esters may be
      obtained. Internal alkenes may be cleaved to two carboxylic acids,
      while terminal alkenes may be epoxidized. Thioethers give
      sulfones, tertiary amines give amine oxides, and phosphines give
      phosphine oxides.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Illustrative of the oxidation power of this salt is the conversion
      of an acridine derivative to the corresponding
      acridine-N-oxide.[3]<br>
      <br>
      It will also oxidize a thioether to a sulfone with 2
      equivalents.[4] With one equivalent the reaction converting
      sulfide to sulfoxide is much faster than that of sulfoxide to
      sulfone, so the reaction can conveniently be stopped at that stage
      if so desired.<br>
      <br>
      Uses<br>
      Potassium peroxymonosulfate can be used in swimming pools to keep
      the water clear, thus allowing chlorine in pools to work to
      sanitize the water rather than clarify the water, resulting in
      less chlorine needed to keep pools clean.[5]<br>

      transfer involved with respect to the tetroxide, rendered it a
      more powerful germicide than other silver entities. The instant
      inventor holds patents for multivalent silver antimicrobials,
      e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,295 for Ag(II) and U.S. Pat. No.
      5,223,149 for Ag (III); and while these entities are stronger
      antimicrobials than Ag (I) compounds, they pale by comparison to
      the tetroxide and so does colloidal silver that derives its
      germicidal properties from trace silver (I) ions it generates in
      various environments. Accordingly, the oligodynamic properties of
      these entities may be summarized as follows, which is referred to
      as the Horsfal series:<br>
      <br>
      Ag4O4 &gt; Ag(III) &gt; Ag(II) &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Ag(I)<br>
      <br>
      The other unique property of the tetroxide was that it did not
      stain organic matter such as skin in like manner as Ag(I)
      compounds do. In addition, it was light stable.<br>
      <br>
      If we are to consider one molecular device in operation, then each
      molecule would release two electrons having each a charge of 4.8 x
      10-10 e.s.u. equivalent to approximately 1.6 x 10-19 coulombs. The
      EMF given in my Encyclopedia of Chemical Electrode Potentials
      (Plenum 1982), page 88, for the oxidation of Ag(I) to Ag(II) is
      1.98 volts which approximates 2.0 V. The total power output per
      device can be calculated in watts by multiplying the power output
      for each electron by 2. Since power is the product of the
      potential times the charge, P = EI; for each electron it would be<br>
      <br>
      2.0 x 1.6 x 10^-19 = 3.2 x 10^-19 watts<br>
      <br>
      From this, and using Avogadro's number, we can calculate that the
      power flux of one liter of solution containing 0.5 PPM of devices
      would be 0.064 watts.<br>
      Since the electronic charges of the devices are directly
      proportional to the number of devices in solution, i.e., the
      concentration of the oxide in the solution, we can arbitrarily
      assign our own device power flux constant which can be used to
      gauge the concentrations of the devices required in order to kill
      particular organisms in specific environments. I have found the
      following formula useful for this purpose:<br>
      <br>
      Power Flux = EMF generated per molecule x Concentration x 5 (the
      EMF being 4.0 volts per molecular device; and the concentration is
      in PPM).<br>
      Utilizing this formula, the power flux to effectuate 100% kills
      for the following organisms is given in Table I which follows.<br>

      When the tetroxide crystals are utilized to destroy pathogens,
      they will not do so unless activated by an oxidizing agent. This
      is analogous to the behavior of single semiconducting photovoltaic
      molecular devices such as copper indium selenide whose surfaces
      must be "etched" in order to activate the photovoltaic activity,
      i.e., for light to facilitate the release of electrons from the
      molecule. The tetroxide was activated by persulfates [ or:
      hydrogen peroxide ]. It was found that when the persulfates were
      tested as a control by themselves, they failed to exhibit any
      unilateral antipathogenic activity at the optimum level selected
      of 10 PPM. The persulfates evaluated varied from OXONE (Registered
      Trademark Du Pont Company) brand potassium monopersulfate to
      alkali peroxydisulfates.<br>
      <br>
      The oxidizing agent to activate the crystals for water supplies
      would be OXONE (Registered Trademark Du Pont Company) or hydrogen
      peroxide.<br>

      Prepare a solution of silver nitrate or silver oxide in dilute
      nitric acid. Any concentration of 1 to 2 mol/l for the nitric acid
      is OK.<br>
      <br>
      Add some solid sodium persulfate to the liquid. Adding a fairly
      concentrated solution of sodium persulfate also works. When this
      is done, then the liquid becomes brown and remains clear. The
      brown color is due to silver (III) ions. The brown color is formed
      quickly, although not instantaneously. It takes a few seconds.<br>
      <br>
      The two pictures below show the brown liquid and a small quantity
      of this liquid, diluted in some dilute nitric acid. These picture
      clearly show the brown color of silver (III) ions
      (*).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*) see remark below.<br>
      <br>
      Silver (III) ions are not very stable. Even in the fairly strongly
      acidic liquids, the compound slowly decomposes. A black
      precipitate is formed and oxygen is released very slowly. This
      black precipitate is due to combined hydrolysis and reduction of
      the silver (III) ions. A mixed silver (I) silver (III) oxide is
      formed, which precipitates from the liquid as a black solid.<br>
      <br>
      Remarkably, when persulfate is added to a neutral solution of
      silver nitrate, then no brown color is formed. In that case the
      liquid first remains colorless, but in the course of a few minutes
      it slowly turns turbid and a dark brown/black precipitate is
      formed. Apparently, at higher pH, the brown silver (III) ion is
      not formed at all and the mixed silver (I) silver (III) oxide is
      formed immediately.<br>
      <br>
      Addition of sodium hydroxide, quick formation of Ag(I)Ag(III)O2<br>
      <br>
      When the brown liquid is added to a solution of sodium hydroxide,
      then the process of formation of the black silver (I) silver (III)
      oxide is almost immediate. As soon as the brown liquid is added to
      a solution of sodium hydroxide, a dark brown very finely divided
      precipitate is formed. The solid particles stick together quickly
      and larger black particles are formed. The black solid slowly
      evolves oxygen and every few minutes it moves to the surface, due
      to many small bubbles of oxygen, which are trapped inside the
      precipitate. When these small bubbles of oxygen are lost, then the
      solid mass sinks to the bottom again. This 'dance' is repeated
      several times.<br>
      <br>
      The three pictures below show the liquid, immediately after adding
      it to a slight excess amount of a solution of NaOH. The second
      picture shows the same liquid a few minutes later, when the
      particles of the precipitate stick to each other. The final
      picture shows the precipitate near the surface, due to lots of
      trapped bubbles of oxygen. All the pictures clearly show the
      bubbles of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Discussion of the results<br>
      <br>
      Here, the reactions with nickel (II) and silver (I) are covered
      separately.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction with nickel<br>
      <br>
      Persulfate oxidizes nickel hydroxide to nickel (IV) oxide in
      water.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ni(OH)2 + 2OH– + S2O82- ? NiO2 + 2SO42- + 2H2O<br>
      <br>
      In the wet environment, the compound NiO2 does not exist as such,
      as suggested by the simplified equation, given above. In fact a
      non-stoichiometric compound, which can best be described as
      NiO2.nH2O is formed, with n some indeterminate number.<br>
      <br>
      On acidification with nitric acid or sulphuric acid, the nickel
      (IV) compound decomposes again:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2NiO2.nH2O(s) + 4H+(aq)&nbsp; ? 2Ni2+(aq) +
      O2(g) + 2H2O + nH2O<br>
      <br>
      When dilute hydrochloric acid is added, then the liquid gives a
      strong smell of chlorine. In that case, the chloride ion is
      oxidized to chlorine. The liquid still bubbles in that case.
      Probably there will be oxidation of chloride to chlorine and still
      the decomposition reaction, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      Reaction with silver<br>
      In acidic media, persulfate is capable of oxidizing silver (I)
      ions to silver (III) ions. These silver (III) ions are brown.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Ag+(aq) + S2O82-(aq) ? Ag3+(aq) + 2SO42-(aq)<br>
      <br>
      Silver (III) ions are not very stable. This liquid slowly looses
      its color and gives off oxygen. A black precipitate is formed of
      silver (I) silver (III) oxide. The silver (III) ions slowly
      oxidize the water, in which they are dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;4Ag3+ + 6H2O ? 2AgIAgIIIO2 + 12H+ + O2<br>
      <br>
      When the liquid is made more basic, then the reaction proceeds
      much faster, as the experiment demonstrates. The following
      reaction occurs in that case.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;4Ag3+ + 12OH– ? 2AgIAgIIIO2 + 6H2O + O2<br>
      <br>
      The compound AgAgO2 in turn also decomposes. It slowly looses
      oxygen and is converted to simple silver (I) oxide.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;2AgIAgIIIO2 ? 2AgI2O + O2<br>
      <br>
      (*) Remark: Whether the brown color is due to plain Ag3+ or due to
      some mixed valency complex of silver (I) and silver (III) is not
      clear to me. It might be that the brown color is due to a mixed
      valency complex of silver (I) and silver (III). Examples of mixed
      valency complexes are also given on the following pages: copper
      (I) / copper (II) and titanium (III) / titanium (IV).<br>
      <br>
      General remarks<br>
      Both the silver (III) compounds and the NiO2 compound are very
      strong oxidizers. Both compounds are capable of oxidizing
      manganese (IV) and manganese (II) to the +7 oxidation state as
      permanganate and chromium (III) is oxidized to the +6 oxidation
      state as dichromate or chromate.<br>
      <br>
      Silver nitrate is a catalyst in many reactions with persulfate in
      acidic media. Persulfate is a strong oxidizer, but it also is
      somewhat sluggish. The reaction between silver (I) and persulfate
      in acidic media, however is quite fast. Silver (III) in turn
      reacts with manganese (II) or chromium (III) quickly to form
      permanganate or dichromate, itself being converted to silver (I)
      again. So, in the presence of a small amount of silver nitrate,
      the persulfate anion can be used as a fast and very strong
      oxidizer. The catalytic action of silver is based on the fact that
      an other pathway for the final redox reaction is provided, with
      Ag3+ as intermediate species.<br>
      <br>
      A similar catalytic action can be observed with nickel hydroxide
      in basic solutions. The reaction between nickel hydroxide and
      persulfate is very fast (instantaneously, at least in terms of
      human observation). Nickel (IV) oxide in turn is capable of
      oxidizing e.g. manganese (IV) oxide to permanganate. This property
      can be used as a sensitive method for detecting manganese.<br>
      <br>
      Another important remark is that in both experiments, the presence
      of chloride ions should be avoided. Especially with the silver
      experiment, chloride ions are really disturbing. They make the
      liquid cloudy, due to formation of silver (I) chloride and they
      interfere, due to oxidation to chlorine.<br>
      <br>
      For the nickel experiment the presence of chloride is not of a
      direct concern, but if one wants to use NiO2 for detection of
      manganese by conversion to the deep purple permanganate, then even
      small amounts of chloride interfere and make the detection fail.<br>
      <br>

      (III) chemistry can be found in the following book: Chemistry of
      the Elements, second edition, written by Greenwood and Earnshaw,

      According to the book "Chemistry of the Elements" of Greenwood,
      the compound silver (II) oxide is not a true silver (II) compound,
      but a mixed oxidation state silver (I) silver (III) oxide, hence
      AgO can better be described as Ag(I)Ag(III)O2, or if you wish
      Ag(I)2 Ag(III)2 O4.<br>
      <br>
      Silver (III) compounds can even be formed in solution by
      dissolving some silver nitrate in dilute nitric acid and adding a
      solution of sodium persulfate or potassium persulfate. The
      solution becomes brown and remains clear. After a while, however,
      it becomes lighter again and while doing so, it slowly produces
      oxygen (I think the Ag(3+) oxidizes the water). I'm not sure
      whether the brown ion is plain aqueous Ag(3+) or a mixed valency
      compound of Ag(3+) and Ag(+). When the solution is not
      sufficiently acidic, then a black precipitate is formed of the
      above mentioned silver (I) silver (III) oxide.<br>

      What guy? I have not seen any references to cancer here. I
      certainly do not have cancer. It is insoluble in water, so how
      would one cure cancer with it?<br>

      All on can get from this cure is a nice gray shade in the face
      from Ag poisoning. (The medical term is argiria.)<br>
      <br>
      First it is argyria, not argiria. Second it is not silver
      poisoning, it is silver deposits in the skin which is only a
      cosmetic condition.<br>

      That is correct. There are two Ag+ and two Ag+++ in Ag4O4. I have
      found this documented elsewhere as well.<br>

      Somewhat similar results can be obtained by mixing a dilute
      solution of silver hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide from
      experiments I have run...<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>The often called silver peroxide and silver(II) oxide, AgO or
      Ag2O2, is actually a mixed oxidation state silver(I,III) oxide. A
      thermochemical cycle, with lattice energies calculated within the
      "volume-based" thermodynamic approach, explain why the
      silver(I,III) oxide is more stable than the hypothetical
      silver(II) oxide. The coordination geometries of silver and copper
      in their known oxides correlate with those associated to their
      electron configurations in coordination compounds. The second
      ionization energy is higher for Ag than for Cu, which can be
      related to the small size of 3d orbitals and the resulting high
      electron repulsion for the first transition series elements.<br>
