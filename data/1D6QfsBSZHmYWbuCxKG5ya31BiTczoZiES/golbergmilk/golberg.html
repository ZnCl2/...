      </b>Intermittently delivered pulsed electric fields technology
      could replace boiling and refrigeration of milk in the low-income
      countries<br>
      <br>
      Milk is a key element for household food security and provides a
      stable income to farmers including women, who are usually in
      charge of taking care of the milk-producing animals in the
      low-income countries. Currently pathogen growth in milk is managed
      with refrigeration or with chemicals. Although bacterial growth in
      milk is managed with refrigeration in the high-income countries, a
      high cost of infrastructure and a demand for a permanent
      electricity supply prevent milk refrigeration in the rural areas
      in the low-income countries. Moreover, certain pathogens, for
      example Listeria monocytogenes, are less sensitive to low
      temperature; therefore, they can proliferate at refrigeration
      during transportation and storage.<br>
      <br>
      "There is a constant search for new, low-cost, chemical-free
      technologies for milk preservation, especially for the small
      farmers in the low-income countries," says Alexander Golberg, PhD
      of Porter School at TAU, the paper's author. "In many rural places
      refrigeration is not possible and its alternative, lactoperoxidaze
      system may be misused to disguise milk produced under poor
      hygienic conditions as Codex Alimentarius. This development not
      only holds great promise for unraveling many aspects of the
      complex wound healing process but can also potentially lead to new
      therapies," Golberg says, " We believe that this model will enable
      other laboratories to learn and uncover new aspects of adult
      tissue growth and development."<br>
      <br>
      Pulsed electric fields is an emerging technology in the food
      industry. It was shown in multiple studies to effectively kill
      multiple food born microorganisms and could provide an
      alternative, non-thermal pasteurization process.<br>
      <br>
      "In the storage application, developed in this work, we use the
      fundamentally different approach for microorganisms control.
      Refrigeration, the major milk preservation technology, slows the
      bacteria metabolism, pulsed electric fields kill them." Alex
      Golberg says. " Moreover, Our model shows that pulsed electric
      fields preservation technology does not require a constant
      electricity supply and can be powered 5.5 hours a day using small,
      family scale solar panels. I believe that this technology can
      provide a robust, simple and energy-efficient milk preservation
      system that would decrease the wasted milk thus increasing the
      income of the small farmers in developing countries."<br>

      Microbial density control is a major challenge for food
      preservation especially in the low-income countries, where 850
      million undernourished people live. In this work, we report on
      non-thermal, chemical-free microbial cell density control by
      intermittently delivered pulsed electric fields (IDPEF). We show
      that IDPEF allows for precise control of L. monocytogenes density
      in contaminated milk, an essential product for small farmers in
      low-income countries. Using L. monocytogenes growth kinetics, we
      designed an IDPEF protocol that consists of 2 sequences of 10
      square wave pulses, 50 µ s duration, 12.5 kV cm-1 electric field
      strength, delivered at 0.5 Hz and 1 min pause between the
      sequences applied every 1.5 hours. In a 12 hours experiment at 32
      °C, L. monocytogenes density of untreated samples reached (9.1 ±
      0.6) · 107 CFU ml-1 and (7.1 ± 0.3) · 108 CFU ml-1 for initial
      load of (1.4 ± 0.2) · 103 CFU ml-1 and (3.1 ± 0.3) · 106 CFU ml-1
      respectively; the final density in the IDPEF treated samples,
      however, was 120 ± 44 CFU ml-1 and (1.1 ± 0.3) · 105 CFU ml-1. The
      energy required for IDPEF storage of milk in the low-income
      countries could be generated by a small-scale 2kW solar energy
      system operating 5.5 hours per day in combination with small-scale
      energy storage system. We believe that IDPEF storage technology
      can empower millions of small farmers in the low-income countries
      by providing them a simple and energy efficient technology for
      milk preservation.<br>

      [0019] Materials which are prone to undesirable organic
      contamination are sterilized prior to storage. For example one
      method for sterilization is pasteurization. Pulsed electrical
      fields have been used for sterilization since the 19thcentury (1).
      A very thorough study on the parameters of pulsed electrical
      fields that destroy microorganisms for sterilization was described
      in a series of three fundamental papers by Sale and Hamilton in
      the 1960's (2, 3, 4). Substantial research has been done over the
      last fifty years to produce better fundamental understanding of
      the mechanism of cell damage during the application of an
      electrical pulse on living organisms (5). Moreover, the range of
      electrical fields and electrical parameters that destroy cells has
      been expanded in recent years (6, 7).<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Patents on devices and methods for using pulsed electrical
      fields for sterilization and destruction of microorganisms are
      known for over fifty years. One of the first patents U.S. Pat. No.
      3,265,605 on the use of pulsed electrical fields for sterilization
      of meat was in Germany by Doevenspeck, H. (8). The use of pulsed
      electrical fields for sterilization of solid and fluid matter has
      become a well established method in the food industry (9).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Several examples of methods and devices for IRE are known.
      U.S. Pat. No. 5,462,644 discloses a method of killing
      microorganisms which form a biofilm on surfaces, including the
      surfaces of medical articles or on tissue or implant surfaces in a
      living subject. Killing of biofilm microorganisms is accomplished
      by applying an electric field to an electrically conductive medium
      in which the biofilm is contained. The electrically conductive
      medium either includes a biocide or is capable of generating a
      biocide in situ upon application of an electric field.<br>

      an energy storage component in circuit communication with the
      power source and for storing energy from the power source, a
      plurality of switches for opening and closing periodically to
      discharge the energy storage component, and a load comprising at
      least one PEF treatment chamber in which biological cells are
      subjected to PEF treatment.<br>

      signal generation circuit is connected with control signal input
      end of pulse generation circuit, two pulse signal output ends of
      said pulse generation circuit are connected with two pulse control
      signal input ends of its discharge circuit, the voltage signal
      input end of said discharge circuit is connected with voltage
      signal output end of its boost up circuit, two electrode plates of
      its sterilization condenser are respectively connected with
      discharge signal output end of discharge circuit and power supply,
      and its treatment chamber is a sealed rectangular space, two
      electrode plates of sterilization condenser are respectively fixed
      on two large-area opposite inner walls of said treatment chamber
      interior, and on a side wall of said treatment chamber a material
      inlet is opened. It can be used in the field of liquor food
      sterilization.<br>

      <br>
      [0028] CN1615759 discloses high voltage pulse electric field
      processing device for food and beverage consisting of two
      electrodes connected to two poles of high voltage pulse power
      supply. The two electrodes are two coaxial hollow pipes in

      separated with insulating rings on two ends and sealed with
      insulating discs. The ring interval between two hollow tubular
      electrodes is cavity for the material to be treated, and there are
      material inlet and material outlet in the outer layer electrode.
      The high voltage pulse electric field processing device is
      suitable for sterilizing food and beverage at normal temperature
      and artificial ageing of wine, and produces no change of treated

      manufacturing facility after sterilization. Liquid drugs for
      example are kept in containers, in which they are stored for
      periods of time after production. Contamination of these liquid
      drugs occurs in many circumstances with substantial detrimental
      effects to the health of the user. There are several possible
      scenarios in which the products may become not sterile. The first
      may be related to residual contamination during manufacturing and
      possible microorganism growth even when the containers are sealed
      and not in contact with the environment. Another such example of
      infections engendered by microorganisms are ophthalmic medications
      contaminated owing to use by a patient, interaction with the
      environment and incubated for several days/weeks and in particular
      those used chronically for many weeks, as in glaucoma patients.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Among the methods for avoiding microorganism growth during
      storage are refrigeration and the addition of chemical additives.
      Refrigeration is not always effective, in particular during long
      term storage. Refrigeration can also be detrimental to the
      composition of the preserved compound, for instance by inducing
      coagulation of organic molecules. Furthermore, it requires an
      infrastructure that can support refrigeration. In addition,
      refrigeration is dependent on the behavioral pattern of the users.
      The use of chemical additives to drugs that are in potential
      contact with the environment during storage is also very common.
      Typically, growth of microorganisms in mediums such as medication,
      vaccines or cosmetic substances is reduced by the inclusion of
      preservatives therein, for example, benzalkonium chloride (BAK)
      used in ophthalmic medication. However, contamination rates as
      high as 40% are still determined in the presence of preservatives
      (11,12). Moreover, most preservatives may cause considerable side
      effects, particularly when applied chronically over long periods
      of time (13,14,15).<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Although application of preservative-free medications seems
      to produce fewer complications to the user, it is appreciated that
      such medications have relatively short life span when opened. A
      possible solution to the use of preservative free,
      non-refrigerated drugs is to ensemble the drugs into sterilized
      single use units, which are used immediately after opening. These,
      however, are considerably more expensive and require a long term
      supply of such single unit dose medications (16).<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Although the aforementioned examples refer to ophthalmic
      medication, it should be appreciated that the same complications
      apply to other type of medications, cosmetic substances, crèmes,
      vaccines etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Another situation involving contamination of matter during
      storage is storage of solid objects in a fluid filled chamber. For
      example, the storage of contact lenses or prosthesis (e.g. teeth,
      eye(s) etc.) or medical implants, in a chamber with saline or
      other fluids. Often the fluids in that chamber become contaminated
      leading to infections (17). Similarly, medical instruments and
      devices may become contaminated when stored especially for reuse.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Another situation involving contamination of matter during
      storage involves various foods in solid or liquid form. For
      instance such fluid foods as milk, water or wine are kept in
      closed containers after sterilization. Other types of solids such
      as meat are also kept in closed containers after sterilization. It
      is often desired to prevent undesirable microbial contamination
      from occurring in those foods after they are opened to the
      environment or from residual contamination. Means to this end
      include keeping the foods at low temperature in refrigeration to
      reduce microbial metabolism or treating the foods with such means
      as pasteurization or adding preservatives, such as sulfides.
      However each of those methods has drawbacks such as the need for
      refrigeration facilities or the changes in chemical composition
      induced by pasteurization or addition of additives.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The invention disclosed here presents a solution to storage
      of matters with the potential for becoming contaminated during the
      storage without the use of refrigeration or chemical additives.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0036] The present invention is directed towards a device, a
      system and a method adapted for use during storage and prior to
      use of a matter stored within the container, to reduce or
      substantially eliminate undesirable organic contamination of the
      stored matter when there is the potential for the matter to become
      contaminated during storage without affecting the intended nature
      of the matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Specific to the devices, systems and methods discussed here
      are that the materials can be stored and sterilized for periods of
      time, under conditions giving rise to the possibility of
      undesirable microorganisms contamination. Possibilities for
      undesirable microbial contamination during storage can occur
      through various means such as interaction between the materials
      and a biologically uncontrolled environment or because of residual
      microorganism inadvertently left after sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The present invention is directed towards devices, systems
      and methods adapted to reduce microorganisms in a matter stored
      therein using electrical pulses. The pulses may be delivered as
      several series, with each series spaced a part from the other so
      as to allow the heat produced and pH changes produced by the
      electrical pulses to dissipate, and with the pulses so designed to
      cause only irreversible damage to microorganisms (s) contained
      within the matter without affecting the matter itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The present invention is further directed towards a system
      comprised of the stored matter and the storage container that has
      the capability to sterilize the matter during storage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Terminology And General Principles of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] The term “reduction” as used herein means that the
      treatment applied on a matter results in mortality of some or all
      target organisms. In other words, after treatment in accordance
      with the present invention, the treated matter contains a
      substantially decreased number of viable microorganisms as
      compared to control. The microorganism may include bacteria,
      fungi, protozoa, algae, spores and the like in any of their forms.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The term “matter” includes mediums such as liquid fluids
      (e.g. emulsions, liquid medications, vaccines, liquid foods etc.),
      substances of various viscosities (e.g. creams, gels, medical or
      cosmetic substances), solid(s) in fluid solution (e.g. eye lenses
      in a preservation medium), solids such as meat etc., which have a
      potential of becoming microbiologically contaminated and capable
      of causing harm to those consuming or coming in contact with such
      medium.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] “Microorganism reduction” is achieved by applying pulsed
      electrical energy having defined voltage, frequency and pulse
      waveform characteristics to the target microorganisms contained in
      the matter. The control settings are designed to treat the entire
      range of possible undesirable microorganisms, for this purpose
      different parameters of the treatment may be changed during
      application of treatment protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] By the terms “pulsed electrical field” or “pulsed
      electrical energy” or “pulsed energy” (PEF), it is meant that the
      combination of electrical field, frequency and pulse waveform
      applied to the organic contaminants is such that substantially no
      free radicals are formed, no ionizing radiation is created, no
      significant temperature rise is detected, no pH change is detected
      etc. such that by application of electrical pulses no detrimental
      effect on the matter is detected, namely the pulsed electrical
      field will affect only the target contaminant, not the matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In accordance with the present invention, it is important
      not to affect the molecular structures of the components in the
      stored matter and therefore the treatment is delivered in such a
      way that the parameters to be monitored and controlled are
      conductivity of the matter within a defined treatment space, pH of
      the matter, temperature of the mater, voltage potential between
      the cathode and anode electrodes of the puller, current generated
      by the electrodes into the matter, pulsed electrical energy, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The term “stored volume” or “storage volume” in accordance
      with the invention may be a volume of any shape and size suitable
      for storage of the matter and which contains at least part of the
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The term “treatment space” or “treatment volume” in
      accordance with the invention may be a volume of any shape and
      size suitable for holding at least part of the matter and
      subjecting it to pulsed energy. The treatment space is defined by
      walls of an enclosure comprising at least a pair of electrodes for
      generating the pulsed energy within the enclosure. The treatment
      space may coincide at least in part with the treatment volume or
      at least with the inlet and/or outlet of the treatment volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The term “treatment protocol” refers to a protocol applied
      on the matter within the treatment space comprising a sequence of
      electrical pulses with various voltages and amplitudes whose
      outcome is the desired reduction in contamination of matter. An
      aspect of this invention is that during the storage of matter the
      treatment protocol is delivered to the treatment space at least
      one time and may be delivered as needed for the period of storage
      to handle recontamination or residual contamination during
      storage. During the application of the treatment protocol, the
      different parameters of the PEF system may change during
      application of the protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The term “active agent” in accordance with the invention
      refers to a pharmaceutically active agent (such as a drug or a
      vaccine), an agent used for imaging, a cosmetically active agent,
      or an hygiene—related active agent such as that used for cleaning
      teeth, contact lenses or any device to be places on or in the body
      (including medical devices).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In such a case the “matter” is in fact the carrier of the
      active agent and is in fact a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier
      (adapted for any type of administration including: oral,
      intravenous, intra-muscular, ophthalmic, by inhalation, to the
      ear, topical, sub-cutanous, transdermal etc.); a cosmetically
      acceptable carrier (in the form of a liquid, a lotion, a cream, a
      salve, an ointment), or a carrier for oral hygiene, contact lens
      hygiene, or medical device hygiene purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Different active agents can “tolerate” different elevation
      of temperature or change of pH before they are damaged. Basically,
      the more sensitive the active agent, the pulse intensity has to be
      lower and or the duration between pulses/series of pulses has to
      be longer to avoid elevation of temperature of the medium or
      changed in pH or changed in the configuration of molecules in
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Design Principles of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      a) Use of pulsed electrical fields (PEF) for sterilization;<br>
      b) The use is for stored matter;<br>
      c) The matter is kept in a storage volume;<br>
      d) In one implementation the matter undergoes several use cycles
      each use episode composed of an opening event where material is
      extracted, a closing event where the container is closed, and a
      storage period between one closing event and the next opening
      event. It each opening event the material is exposed to the
      environment and has a danger of being contaminated. The PEF are
      delivered at least once every use cycle;<br>
      e) In another implementation the matter in the storage volume
      undergoes at least one treatment cycle, during which the matter is
      moved to a treatment space and the PEFs are delivered and the
      matter is then returned to the storage volume;<br>
      f) Matter is treated in a treatment volume where the pulsed
      electrical field is applied;<br>
      g) The treatment volume coincides at least in part with storage
      volume or at least with the inlet and/or outlet to the storage
      volume;<br>
      h) The electrical fields are delivered through at least two
      electrodes fitted at a vicinity of the treated volume<br>
      i) Because of the coinciding volumes of treatment and storage
      volumes the electrodes are disposed in the storage volume or a
      portion thereof or at least at the inlet/outlet of the storage
      volume;<br>
      j) Treatment protocols may be delivered once or more and may
      differ from one another;<br>
      k) Sterilization through PEF is based on producing an electrical
      field in the entire medium or a portion thereof that has the
      ability to cause electrical field induced damage to microorganisms
      in the part of the medium that is targeted. The electrical fields
      can be produced through reacting electrodes in contact with the
      solution, through salt bridges, through electrical discharge in a
      solution across a dielectric barrier or by induction
      electromagnetic field. The electrical fields which are produced
      can vary as a function of time and space and depend on the
      electromagnetic boundary conditions set from the exterior of the
      system as well as the electrical properties of the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In accordance with the above specified principles, the
      geometry of the container is assessed and the positioning of the
      electrodes is determined. Then the electrical field is calculated
      and the ability of the field to sterilize the desired volume is
      evaluated. The temperature is calculated and the thermal damage to
      the medium is estimated. The pH changes are evaluated and the
      pulses are designed to minimize changes to important molecules in
      matter. The electrical field that may induce chemical changes to
      important molecules in matter is assessed and the pulses are
      further designed to minimize changes to important molecules in
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] One aspect of the present invention is to provide a device
      and system adapted to reduce microorganisms in the matter stored
      therein using PEF treatment protocol affecting the target
      microorganism(s) without causing detrimental effects to the stored
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In accordance with one embodiment of this aspect the device
      and system of the invention comprise a space adapted for long term
      storage of matter. The device is provided with an opening through
      which the matter is introduced/dispensed. The storage volume is
      fitted with a PEF system comprising:<br>
      <br>
      a. two or more electrodes disposed within said space and
      contacting the matter directly or through a conductive fluid or
      gel; and<br>
      b. an electric pulse source connected to the two or more
      electrodes and adapted to pass electric current through a
      treatment volume which constitutes the entire or part of the
      storage volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In accordance with another embodiment of this aspect the
      device of the invention comprises a main space adapted for holding
      and long term storage of matter and a dispensing space adapted to
      hold and dispense a dose volume. The dispensing space is in flow
      communication with the main space and is provided with a
      dispensing outlet; and wherein the main space or/and at least the
      dispensing space is fitted with a PEF system.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] In accordance with yet an embodiment of this aspect, the
      device of the invention comprises a main space adapted for holding
      and long term storage of matter and a treatment space. The matter
      is circulated between the main space and the treatment space and
      the PEFs are applied to the matter in the treatment space during
      flow of the matter therethrough.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a
      device having a storage volume containing the matter to be
      treated, a PEF system for microorganism reduction in the matter
      within the storage volume which affects the target
      microorganism(s) without causing detrimental effects to the stored
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The present invention further concerns a device as
      described herein containing a fluid holding at least one active
      agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Another aspect of the invention is to provide a system for
      applying PEF comprising<br>
      <br>
      a container adapted to receive a matter, comprising a space
      adapted for holding the matter and having an inlet/outlet opening;<br>
      a matter;<br>
      two or more electrodes disposed within said container and
      contacting at least a portion of the matter;<br>
      electric pulse source connected to the two or more electrodes and
      adapted to pass electric current through the matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] According to an embodiment of this aspect, the container
      further comprises a dispensing space for dispensing of a volume,
      said dispensing space being in flow communication with the space
      and formed with a dispensing outlet.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a method for
      reducing microorganisms and comprises the following steps:<br>
      <br>
      Providing a container adapted to hold a medium comprising active
      agents, fitted with an PEF system comprising two or more
      electrodes disposed within said container so as to contact the
      medium; an electric pulse source connected to the two or more
      electrodes and adapted to pass pulsed electrical energy through
      the medium; and a control unit connected to the electric pulse
      source adapted to allow the user to control the pulsed electrical
      energy output of the system;<br>
      Setting the electrical energy of the system; and<br>
      Applying a sterilization/treatment protocol that may consist of
      application of electrical pulses that can range in length, in
      pulse amplitude, may vary in shape, applied at least once and
      whose effect is such that it reduces the number of viable
      microorganisms in stored matter without inducing any change in the
      matter medium that may damage the active agents contained therein.<br>
      The entire sterilization protocol is delivered to the stored
      medium or portions thereof once or more to facilitate long term
      storage while interacting with the environment. The parameters of
      the PEF system may be determined on a case by case basis.
      Typically this may be done easily by introducing into a model
      system a fluid containing an active agent of interest such as a
      drug or a vaccine together with a known amount of a microorganism
      that can infect the container. Than a series of pulses varying in
      intensity, duration and frequency are applied and the parameters
      of the medium that can cause damage to the active ingredient (e.g.
      temperature, pH, ionic content etc.) are monitored.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The parameters chosen are such that on the one hand do not
      cause substantial damage to the matter or the active agent, and on
      the other hand cause a significant reduction of the target
      microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Any one or more of the following features/parameters and
      designs may be applied to any one of the aspects subject of the
      present invention:<br>
      <br>
      the sterilization/treatment protocol is applied to the stored

      the power may be applied to the system through a fixed power
      source, e.g. batteries, electric cord coupled to the mains; a
      detachable attachable power source, eg. a pack of batteries; or by

      event that the pulses are delivered in a discrete fashion, the
      pulse(s) are delivered with a time interval therebetween. The time
      interval may range from nanoseconds to minutes, more preferable
      from 10 microseconds to 1 millisecond.<br>
      twenty pulses may be given in four sets of five pulses separated
      by one minute interval between the sets.<br>
      at least 10 pulses may be delivered continuously.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0123] The present invention discloses a device, a system and a
      method for reducing microorganisms in matter utilizing PEF for
      sterilization of matter. Embodiments of the invention may be
      defined in accordance with several groups, as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] I. A container adapted to contain and store matter
      comprising a PEF system with the electrodes fitted within the body
      of the container and in which the PEF sterilization/treatment
      protocol will be applied on the volume of matter stored therein at
      least once to sterilize and maintain the matter sterile;<br>
      II. A container adapted to contain and store matter comprising a
      PEF system with the electrodes fitted at an inlet/outlet portion
      of the container storing the matter to prevent the stored matter
      from becoming contaminated through the inlet outlet;<br>
      III. A container adapted to contain and store matter comprising a
      PEF system with the electrodes fitted at an inlet/outlet portion
      of the container storing the matter to prevent contaminated stored
      matter from contaminating an organism using the stored matter.<br>
      IV. A container adapted to contain and store matter having a
      storage space and a treatment space, comprising at least one PEF
      system where the electrodes are fitted at least at the treatment
      space such that when matter is propelled through the treatment
      space, the PEF system is activated and the matter is
      treated/sterilized.<br>
      V. A container containing matter and adapted to store the matter
      comprising at least one PEF system for sterilizing the stored
      matter within the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] In the figures, like reference numerals indicate the same
      elements throughout.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Attention is first directed to FIGS. 1 to 4 of the
      drawings, illustrating a “real-time” sterilization container, in
      accordance with one aspect of the invention, generally designated
      10. In accordance with one example, the container comprises a main
      body 12 having a space 16, a secondary body 14 having a dispensing
      space 18 having a bottom portion 13 connected to the main body 12
      such as to be in the fluid flow communication with the space 16,
      and adapted for holding at least one dose of a medium therein and
      a top portion provided with a dispensing aperture 17 for
      dispensing the medium therethrough and a PEF system, generally
      designated 20, fitted between the secondary body 14 and the main
      body 12 such as to allow sterilization at least of the medium in
      the vicinity thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] The container as illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 is further
      provided with a membrane 30 fitted with a one way valve 32, such
      as a mushroom type valve, allowing the medium to flow through an
      opening 33 in the membrane towards and into the dispensing space
      18 when the container 10 is for example turned over or tilted to a
      side.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] It will be appreciated that the container may also be
      fitted with any type of dosing mechanism extending through the
      membrane so as to pump a metered dose of medium from the reservoir
      of the medium in the main body 12 into the dispensing space 18 of
      the secondary body 14, thus eliminating the need in turning over
      or tilting the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The PEF system 20 comprises two electrodes 22a and 22b
      disposed on the inside of the secondary body 14, so as to come in
      contact with the medium when contained within the dispensing space
      18, an electric pulse generating source 24 in contact with the
      electrodes 22a and 22b. The electric pulse generating source 24
      comprises a power source (e.g. battery, a rechargeable battery,
      conductive chargeable capacitor etc.), pulse controller, adapted
      to generate pulsed electric energy and an activation mechanism 26
      adapted to activate the electric pulse generating source 24 so as
      to close an electric circle between the electrodes and the
      electric pulse generating source 24 and discharge pulsed electric
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] According to an example of the invention, the PEF system is
      further provided with a control unit 37 connected to the electric
      pulse source adapted to allow the user to control the values of
      the pulsed electrical energy output of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] According to the example illustrated in FIG. 1, the main
      body 12 of the container 10 and the secondary body 14 are
      integrally formed. According to the examples illustrated in FIGS.
      2 and 3, the main body of the container comprises a base 15, side
      wall(s) 19 and an attachment portion 11. According to these
      examples, the secondary body 14 is an add-on member and may be
      mounted on the main body 12 of the container 10 through the
      attachment portion 11 thereof. According to these examples the
      attachment portion 11 of the main body is fitted with the
      electrodes and the membrane fitted with the one-way valve, whilst
      the electric pulse generating source 24 and the activation
      mechanism are fitted on the secondary body 14 such that when the
      secondary body 14 is mounted on the main body 12 the electric
      pulse generating source 24 and the electrodes are in contact so as
      to allow activation of the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Attention is now directed to FIGS. 4a to 4c of the drawings
      illustrating a different concept, wherein the PEF system is
      provided at inlet/outlet of the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Referring first to FIG. 4a there is illustrated a neck
      portion 100 of a liquid holding container 102 (partially
      illustrated) with a PEF system 120 comprising a first electrode
      122a and a second electrode 122b each fitted with a dispensing
      133a and 133b respectively, constituting together a flow path
      between the storage space 112 within the container and the
      outlet/inlet 137 thereof. Each of the electrodes 122a and 122b is
      coupled through a conductive segment 150a and 150b to an electric
      pulse generating source (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0133] In this example a treatment space 154 extends between two
      electrodes 122a and 122b whereby a liquid medium dispensed through
      the outlet 137 flows through said space 154 whereupon it is
      sterilized/treated prior to dispensing thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] The example illustrated in FIG. 4b differs from the example
      of FIG. 4a in that the neck portion 200 of the container 202
      (partially illustrated) is fitted with a different PEF system 220.
      The PEF system 220 is constituted by a first electrode 222a and a
      second electrode 222b both of a substantially cylindrical cross
      section and substantially coaxially disposed within the neck
      portion 200 each of which is coupled through a conductive segment
      250a and 250b to an electric pulse generating source (not shown)
      (in the examples of FIGS. 4a to 4c the conductive segments are in
      the form of conductive wires embedded within or along the
      containers body).<br>
      <br>
      [0135] In FIG. 4b, a diaphragm member 255 in a form of a porous
      filter is provided between the two electrodes 222a and 222b
      thereby constituting a barrier to prevent a 30 free flow of the
      medium from the storage space to the inlet/outlet 237 so as to
      ensure that the dispensed medium undergoes sterilization/treatment
      protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The example of FIG. 4c discloses a neck portion 300 of a
      container 302 (partially illustrated) fitted with a modified PEF
      system 320. The PEF system 320 is constituted by a pair of
      electrodes 322a and 322b each coupled to an electric pulse
      generating source (not shown) through a conductive segment 350a
      and 350b, respectively. The electrodes are disposed substantially
      opposite one another defining a treatment space 354 with a flow
      path extending between the storage space 312, through the
      treatment space 354 and out through the outlet 337.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] Further attention is directed to the examples illustrated
      in FIGS. 5a to 5c showing three examples of matter holding
      containers fitted with a PEF system received within the container.
      In the example of FIG. 5a there is illustrated a container 400
      with a PEF system in the form of a coaxial pair of electrodes 422a
      and 422b each coupled to an electric pulse generating source (not
      shown). In this example the coaxial electrodes are cylindrical
      with the space 423 extending within the electrode 422b being
      sealed by seal 425 to prevent matter from entering said space
      without being treated. The example illustrated in FIG. 5b
      describes a container 500 fitted at its interior with a PEF system
      comprising a pair of substantially opposed electrodes 522a and
      522b for treating a liquid matter stored within the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] FIG. 5c is a schematic top sectioned view of the container
      600 fitted at its interior with a PEF system comprising a central
      first electrode 622a and surrounded by a plurality of
      substantially parallely extending second electrodes 622b for
      treating a liquid matter stored within the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] The container in accordance with any of the examples
      provided herein is suitably made of a non conductive material,
      such as plastic, ceramics, glass etc., or a combination of
      materials. The container may be of any geometrical shape and
      volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] The electrodes according to the present invention may be
      molded or otherwise integrated within the container or a treatment
      space.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] According to the present invention, the container described
      herein with reference to FIGS. 1-3 may be pre-filled prior to
      being purchased by the user (e.g. FIG. 1) or may be filled by the
      user with medium acquired separately (e.g. FIG. 2). Prior to the
      activation of the PEF system on the container, the parameter
      values of the system are set/adjusted as desired through the
      control unit connected to the electric pulse source such as to
      allow the user to control the pulsed electrical energy output of
      the system. According to an example of the invention, the
      parameter values of the system are pre-set (e.g. during the
      manufacturing process). A desired amount of the medium is caused
      to flow into the dispensing space either by the dosing mechanism
      or simply by tilting or turning over the container. Electrical
      pulses are then delivered either continuously or discretely by
      activating the system and the medium is substantially sterilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] FIGS. 6a-6d illustrate a container, generally designated
      700 comprising a main space 744 adapted to receive a medium. FIG.
      6a is a schematic illustration of a contact lens storage container
      fitted with a PEF system 720 comprising pair of electrodes 722a
      and 722b parallely extending within the container defining between
      them a treatment space 754. Whilst not seen, the container
      comprises an electric pulse generating source and a power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] According to the examples described herein, an activation
      mechanism and the control unit may be wirelessly connected to the
      rest of the PEF system so as to allow the user to activate the
      system from a distance.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The example of the FIG. 6b differs from the example of FIG.
      6a by a provision of fluid inlet 755 and a fluid outlet 757 with a
      flow path extending between the inlet and outlet and a treatment
      space 754. This arrangement facilitates circulation of fluid
      through the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] A container 40 illustrated in FIGS. 6c and 6d is further
      provided with a tray 36 positioned within the main space 44 and
      immersed within the medium. The tray 36 has a holding portion 38
      provided with at least one opening 39 so as to allow fluid to pass
      therethrough and elevating portion 49a and 49b supporting the tray
      at an elevated position. FIG. 6d is a modification of the
      container 40 exemplified in FIG. 6c, having a top cover 42 with
      one electrode mounted on the base of the container 40 and the
      other on the inside of the cover 42.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Such container may be used to sterilize semi solid or solid
      materials immersed in the fluid medium such as contact lens 47.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] FIG. 7 illustrates a torus shaped vessel 800 fitted with an
      intergraded circulation pump 803 for circulating fluid through the
      interior space 805. Disposed within the torus 800 is a PEF system
      807 comprising a pair of electrodes 809a and 809b defining a space
      therebetween constituting a treatment space 811 and connected to
      an electric pulse generating source so as to apply a sterilization
      protocol at least to the medium circulated through the treatment
      space 811. The electrodes may be in the form of perforated disks
      to facilitate medium flow circulation through the torus 800. It is
      appreciated the system exemplified in FIG. 7 may comprises one or
      more PEF systems disposed along the vessel and further, the pump
      803 may be of any type such as a peristaltic pump etc. whereby
      medium continuously flows through the torus and continuously
      undergoes sterilization.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The following Example is representative of techniques
      employed by the inventors in carrying out aspects of the present
      invention. It should be appreciated that while these techniques
      are exemplary embodiments for the practice of the invention, those
      skilled in the art, in light of the present disclosure, will
      recognize that numerous modifications can be made without
      departing from the spirit and intended scope of the invention,
      mutatis mutandis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE:</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Pharmaceutical</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0149] Preservative free drop solution (HYLO-COMOD® Sodium
      Hyaluronate 0.1% from URSAPHARM, Arzneimittel GmbH &amp; Co. KG
      Indutraiestrasse, D-66129, Saarbruken, Germany) was used as a
      model for a preservative free liquid solution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Microorganisms</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0150] Escherichia coli tetracycline stable bacteria cultures were
      used. The cultures of microorganisms were prepared by transferring
      the organisms from Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates to 500 ml
      LB-Miller broth, which was agitated in a temperature controlled
      incubator at 37° C. until 10&lt;8 &gt;CFU/ml were achieved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>3. Electroporation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0151] 5 µl of the culture was added to 1 ml of the preservative
      free drop solution. Several dilutions were performed until the
      final concentration of microorganism in drops was 10&lt;6
      &gt;CFU/ml. Electroporation was performed using a system of the
      invention. The cells, 80 µl in volume at a concentration of one
      million cells per milliliter, were placed in the container and
      subjected to an uni-polar rectangular electrical pulse 100 µsec
      width with 1 second interval between the pulses.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] Immediately after the electroporation the temperature in
      the cuvette was measured by Reflex Signal Conditioner with 0.7 mm
      probe covered with polyimide (Neoptix, Inc, Québec, Canada).<br>
      <br>
      [0153] The pH of the solution was measured immediately after the
      electroporation with<br>
      <br>
      [0154] Neutralit® pH 5,0-10,0 (MERCK, KGaA, Germany),
      pH-Indikatorpapier Spezialindikator pH 8.2-10.0 (MERCK, KGaA,
      Germany), Acilit® pH-Indikatorpapier pH 0.5-5 (MERCK, KGaA,
      Germany).<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Microorganisms Viability Test</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0155] Pour plating counting method was used. After the treatment
      the solution was dissolved 10 fold in Dulbecco's phosphate
      buffered saline (Biological Industries, Kibutz Beit Haemek,
      Israel) in order to eliminate the effect of the eye drops contents
      on cell growth as described in European Pharmacopoeia Test for
      efficiency of antimicrobial preservations. 100 µl of each solution
      was plated in duplicate on LB-Miller Tetracycline agar. Plates
      were incubated at 37° C. for 18 h. Counting was done using MRC
      colony counter model 570 (MRC, Israel).<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Experimental Protocol</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0156] A study was performed to determine the combinations of PEF
      parameters in which the fluid drug can be sterilized while atored
      without a substantial increase in temperature and change in pH. An
      important aspect of this study was to determine if the drug can be
      stored in a sterile form using PEF pulses. Furthermore, in the
      food industry the electrical fields used can be very high, the
      goal of this study was to determine if lower fields than those
      used in the food industry are possible so as to allow the system
      to be used outside laboratory or industry settings.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] Electroporation parameters for bacterial sterilization were
      investigated by comparing the effects of electrical fields of 5.4
      kV/cm, 7.2 kV/cm or 10 kV/cm, delivered as 100 µsec length square
      pulses at a frequency of 1 Hz in sequences of: a) as twenty pulses
      given four sets of five pulses separated by one minute interval
      between sets, b) twenty pulses and c) ten pulses. Pour plate
      counting method was used to determine the bacterial survival
      percentage after the treatment. The impact of the treatment
      parameter on temperature and pH was monitored. The end point of
      each experiment was to measure viability, temperature and pH. All
      experiments were repeated 5 times.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6. Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0158] FIGS. 8a and 8b show the effect of the number of PEF pulses
      and the sequence in which they are delivered, on microorganism
      survival and solution temperature, respectively. The results are
      for an electrical field of 10 kV/cm and the pulse sequences of
      case a (20 pulses—4 discrete sets of 5 pulses), b (20 pulses), and
      c (10 pulses).<br>
      <br>
      [0159] The figures show that doubling the number of pulses from 10
      to 20 causes a more than tenfold reduction in the percentage of
      microorganisms' survival, from 4.33% to 0.37%. Doubling the number
      of pulses causes only a 3° C. increase in the sample temperature.
      Changing the sequence in which the 20 pulses are delivered, from
      continuous in case (b), to discrete four groups of five in case
      (a), resulted in additional 3 times further decrease of survival
      number of microorganisms from 0.37% to 0.14%. However, the
      temperature increased less than when 10 pulses were delivered
      continuously.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] In all the experiments the pH of the samples after
      treatment remained the same as in the control sample, 7.5.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] FIGS. 9a and 9b show the effect of the field intensity on
      the microorganism survival and solution temperature, respectively.
      The experiments reported here are for a sequence of 20 pulses of
      5.4 kV/cm, 7.2 kV/cm and 10 kV/cm, delivered at a frequency of 1
      Hz. Increasing the field strength from 5.4 kV/cm to 10 kV/cm
      caused more than 100 fold reduction in microorganisms' viability
      from 53.49% to 0.37%. The temperature difference between the
      highest and lowest field was about 6° C. The highest temperature
      did not exceed 36 C°. In all the experiments the pH of the samples
      after treatment was the same as that of the control sample, 7.5.<br>
