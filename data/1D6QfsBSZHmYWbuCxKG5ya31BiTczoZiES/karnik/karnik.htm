        <i>MIT group shows xylem tissue in sapwood can filter bacteria
          from contaminated water.</i><br>

        <b>Jennifer Chu, MIT News Office</b><br>
        <br>
        <img alt="" src="Xylem.jpg" height="358" width="537"><br>

      <br>
      If you’ve run out of drinking water during a lakeside camping
      trip, there’s a simple solution: Break off a branch from the
      nearest pine tree, peel away the bark, and slowly pour lake water
      through the stick. The improvised filter should trap any bacteria,
      producing fresh, uncontaminated water.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, an MIT team has discovered that this low-tech filtration
      system can produce up to four liters of drinking water a day —
      enough to quench the thirst of a typical person.<br>
      <br>
      In a paper published this week in the journal PLoS ONE, the
      researchers demonstrate that a small piece of sapwood can filter
      out more than 99 percent of the bacteria E. coli from water. They
      say the size of the pores in sapwood — which contains xylem tissue
      evolved to transport sap up the length of a tree — also allows
      water through while blocking most types of bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Co-author Rohit Karnik, an associate professor of mechanical
      engineering at MIT, says sapwood is a promising, low-cost, and
      efficient material for water filtration, particularly for rural
      communities where more advanced filtration systems are not readily
      accessible.<br>
      <br>
      “Today’s filtration membranes have nanoscale pores that are not
      something you can manufacture in a garage very easily,” Karnik
      says. “The idea here is that we don’t need to fabricate a
      membrane, because it’s easily available. You can just take a piece
      of wood and make a filter out of it.”<br>
      <br>
      The paper’s co-authors include Michael Boutilier and Jongho Lee
      from MIT, Valerie Chambers from Fletcher-Maynard Academy in
      Cambridge, Mass., and Varsha Venkatesh from Jericho High School in
      Jericho, N.Y.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tapping the flow of sap</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are a number of water-purification technologies on the
      market today, although many come with drawbacks: Systems that rely
      on chlorine treatment work well at large scales, but are
      expensive. Boiling water to remove contaminants requires a great
      deal of fuel to heat the water. Membrane-based filters, while able
      to remove microbes, are expensive, require a pump, and can become
      easily clogged.<br>
      <br>
      Sapwood may offer a low-cost, small-scale alternative. The wood is
      comprised of xylem, porous tissue that conducts sap from a tree’s
      roots to its crown through a system of vessels and pores. Each
      vessel wall is pockmarked with tiny pores called pit membranes,
      through which sap can essentially hopscotch, flowing from one
      vessel to another as it feeds structures along a tree’s length.
      The pores also limit cavitation, a process by which air bubbles
      can grow and spread in xylem, eventually killing a tree. The
      xylem’s tiny pores can trap bubbles, preventing them from
      spreading in the wood.<br>
      <br>
      “Plants have had to figure out how to filter out bubbles but allow
      easy flow of sap,” Karnik observes. “It’s the same problem with
      water filtration where we want to filter out microbes but maintain
      a high flow rate. So it’s a nice coincidence that the problems are
      similar.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>Seeing red</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To study sapwood’s water-filtering potential, the researchers
      collected branches of white pine and stripped off the outer bark.
      They cut small sections of sapwood measuring about an inch long
      and half an inch wide, and mounted each in plastic tubing, sealed
      with epoxy and secured with clamps.<br>
      <br>
      Before experimenting with contaminated water, the group used water
      mixed with red ink particles ranging from 70 to 500 nanometers in
      size. After all the liquid passed through, the researchers sliced
      the sapwood in half lengthwise, and observed that much of the red
      dye was contained within the very top layers of the wood, while
      the filtrate, or filtered water, was clear. This experiment showed
      that sapwood is naturally able to filter out particles bigger than
      about 70 nanometers.<br>
      <br>
      However, in another experiment, the team found that sapwood was
      unable to separate out 20-nanometer particles from water,
      suggesting that there is a limit to the size of particles
      coniferous sapwood can filter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Picking the right plant</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Finally, the team flowed inactivated, E. coli-contaminated water
      through the wood filter. When they examined the xylem under a
      fluorescent microscope, they saw that bacteria had accumulated
      around pit membranes in the first few millimeters of the wood.
      Counting the bacterial cells in the filtered water, the
      researchers found that the sapwood was able to filter out more
      than 99 percent of E. coli from water.<br>
      <br>
      Karnik says sapwood likely can filter most types of bacteria, the
      smallest of which measure about 200 nanometers. However, the
      filter probably cannot trap most viruses, which are much smaller
      in size.<br>
      <br>
      Karnik says his group now plans to evaluate the filtering
      potential of other types of sapwood. In general, flowering trees
      have smaller pores than coniferous trees, suggesting that they may
      be able to filter out even smaller particles. However, vessels in
      flowering trees tend to be much longer, which may be less
      practical for designing a compact water filter.<br>
      <br>
      Designers interested in using sapwood as a filtering material will
      also have to find ways to keep the wood damp, or to dry it while
      retaining the xylem function. In other experiments with dried
      sapwood, Karnik found that water either did not flow through well,
      or flowed through cracks, but did not filter out contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      “There’s huge variation between plants,” Karnik says. “There could
      be much better plants out there that are suitable for this
      process. Ideally, a filter would be a thin slice of wood you could
      use for a few days, then throw it away and replace at almost no
      cost. It’s orders of magnitude cheaper than the high-end membranes
      on the market today.”<br>
      <br>
      While the pores in sapwood are too big to filter out salts, Saurya
      Prakash, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Ohio
      State University, says the design could be useful in parts of the
      world where people collect surface water, which can be polluted
      with fine dust and particles of decaying plant and animal matter.
      Most of this detritus, Prakash says, could easily be filtered out
      by the group’s design.<br>
      <br>
      “The xylem tissue acts as a natural filter, similar to a manmade
      membrane,” says Prakash, who was not involved in the research.
      “The study by the Karnik group shows that use of abundant,
      naturally occurring materials could pave the way for a new
      generation of water filters that are potentially low-cost enough
      to be disposable.”<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Effective point-of-use devices for providing safe drinking water
      are urgently needed to reduce the global burden of waterborne
      disease. Here we show that plant xylem from the sapwood of
      coniferous trees – a readily available, inexpensive,
      biodegradable, and disposable material – can remove bacteria from
      water by simple pressure-driven filtration. Approximately 3 cm3 of
      sapwood can filter water at the rate of several liters per day,
      sufficient to meet the clean drinking water needs of one person.
      The results demonstrate the potential of plant xylem to address
      the need for pathogen-free drinking water in developing countries
      and resource-limited settings.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The scarcity of clean and safe drinking water is one of the major
      causes of human mortality in the developing world. Potable or
      drinking water is defined as having acceptable quality in terms of
      its physical, chemical, and bacteriological parameters so that it
      can be safely used for drinking and cooking [1]. Among the water
      pollutants, the most deadly ones are of biological origin:
      infectious diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria, viruses,
      protozoa, or parasites are the most common and widespread health
      risk associated with drinking water [1], [2]. The most common
      water-borne pathogens are bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli,
      Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae), viruses (e.g. adenoviruses,
      enteroviruses, hepatitis, rotavirus), and protozoa (e.g. giardia)
      [1]. These pathogens cause child mortality and also contribute to
      malnutrition and stunted growth of children. The World Health
      Organization reports [3] that 1.6 million people die every year
      from diarrheal diseases attributable to lack of access to safe
      drinking water and basic sanitation. 90% of these are children
      under the age of 5, mostly in developing countries. Multiple
      barriers including prevention of contamination, sanitation, and
      disinfection are necessary to effectively prevent the spread of
      waterborne diseases [1]. However, if only one barrier is possible,
      it has to be disinfection unless evidence exists that chemical
      contaminants are more harmful than the risk from ingestion of
      microbial pathogens [1]. Furthermore, controlling water quality at
      the point-of-use is often most effective due to the issues of
      microbial regrowth, byproducts of disinfectants, pipeline
      corrosion, and contamination in the distribution system [2], [4].<br>
      <br>
      Common technologies for water disinfection include chlorination,
      filtration, UV-disinfection, pasteurization or boiling, and ozone
      treatment [1], [2], [5]. Chlorine treatment is effective on a
      large scale, but becomes expensive for smaller towns and villages.
      Boiling is an effective method to disinfect water; however, the
      amount of fuel required to disinfect water by boiling is several
      times more than what a typical family will use for cooking [1].
      UV-disinfection is a promising point-of-use technology available
      [1], yet it does require access to electricity and some
      maintenance of the UV lamp, or sufficient sunlight. While small
      and inexpensive filtration devices can potentially address the
      issue of point-of-use disinfection, an ideal technology does not
      currently exist. Inexpensive household carbon-based filters are
      not effective at removing pathogens and can be used only when the
      water is already biologically safe [1]. Sand filters that can
      remove pathogens require large area and knowledge of how to
      maintain them [1], while membrane filters capable of removing
      pathogens [2], [4] suffer from high costs, fouling, and often
      require pumping power due to low flow rates [6] that prevents
      their wide implementation in developing countries. In this
      context, new approaches that can improve upon current technologies
      are urgently needed. Specifically, membrane materials that are
      inexpensive, readily available, disposable, and effective at
      pathogen removal could greatly impact our ability to provide safe
      drinking water to the global population.<br>
      <br>
      If we look to nature for inspiration, we find that a potential
      solution exists in the form of plant xylem – a porous material
      that conducts fluid in plants [7]. Plants have evolved specialized
      xylem tissues to conduct sap from their roots to their shoots.
      Xylem has evolved under the competing pressures of offering
      minimal resistance to the ascent of sap while maintaining small
      nanoscale pores to prevent cavitation. The size distribution of
      these pores – typically a few nanometers to a maximum of around
      500 nm, depending on the plant species [8] – also happens to be
      ideal for filtering out pathogens, which raises the interesting
      question of whether plant xylem can be used to make inexpensive
      water filtration devices. Although scientists have extensively
      studied plant xylem and the ascent of sap, use of plant xylem in
      the context of water filtration remains to be explored.
      Measurements of sap flow in plants suggest that flow rates in the
      range of several liters per hour may be feasible with less than 10
      cm-sized filters, using only gravitational pressure to drive the
      flow [7].<br>
      <br>
      We therefore investigated whether plant xylem could be used to
      create water filtration devices. First, we reason which type of
      plant xylem tissue is most suitable for filtration. We then
      construct a simple water filter from plant xylem and study the
      resulting flow rates and filtration characteristics. Finally, we
      show that the xylem filter can effectively remove bacteria from
      water and discuss directions for further development of these
      filters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Branches were excised from white pine growing on private property
      in Massachusetts, USA, with permission of the owner and placed in
      water. The pine was identified as pinus strobus based on the
      5-fold grouping of its needles, the average needle length of 4.5
      inches, and the cone shape. Deionized water (Millipore) was used
      throughout the experiments unless specified otherwise. Red pigment
      (pigment-based carmine drawing ink, Higgins Inks) was dissolved in
      deionized water. Nile-red coated 20 nm fluorescent polystyrene
      nanospheres were obtained from Life Technologies. Inactivated,
      Alexa 488 fluorescent dye labeled Escherichia coli were obtained
      from Life Technologies. Wood sections were inserted into the end
      of 3/8 inch internal diameter PVC tubing, sealed with 5 Minute
      Epoxy, secured with hose clamps, and allowed to cure for ten
      minutes before conducting flow rate experiments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Construction of the Xylem Filter</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1 inch-long sections were cut from a branch with approximately 1
      cm diameter. The bark and cambium were peeled off, and the piece
      was mounted at the end of a tube and sealed with epoxy. The
      filters were flushed with 10 mL of deionized water before
      experiments. Care was taken to avoid drying of the filter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Filtration and Flow Rate Experiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Approximately 5 mL of deionized water or solution was placed in
      the tube. Pressure was supplied using a nitrogen tank with a
      pressure regulator. For filtration experiments, 5 psi (34.5 kPa)
      pressure was used. The filtrate was collected in glass vials. For
      dye filtration, size distribution of the pigments was measured for
      the input solution and the filtrate. Higgins pigment-based carmine
      drawing ink, diluted ~1000× in deionized water, was used as the
      input dye solution. For bacteria filtration, the feed solution was
      prepared by mixing 0.08 mg of inactivated Escherichia coli in 20
      mL of deionized water (~1.6×107 mL-1) after which the solution was
      sonicated for 1 min. The concentration of bacteria was measured in
      the feed solution and filtrate by enumeration with a hemacytometer
      (inCyto C-chip) mounted on a Nikon TE2000-U inverted
      epifluorescence microscope. Before measurement of concentration
      and filtration experiments, the feed solution was sonicated for 1
      min and vigorously mixed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Imaging</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Xylem structure was visualized in a scanning electron microscope
      (SEM, Zeiss Supra55VP). Samples were coated with gold of 5 nm
      thickness before imaging. To visualize bacteria filtration, 5 mL
      of solution at a bacteria concentration of ~1.6×107 mL-1 was
      flowed into the filter. The filter was then cut longitudinally
      with a sharp blade. One side of the sample was imaged using a
      Nikon TE2000-U inverted epifluorescence microscope and the other
      was coated with gold and imaged with the SEM. Optical images were
      acquired of the cross section of a filter following filtration of
      5 mL of the dye at a dilution of ~100×.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Particle Sizing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dynamic light scattering measurements of particle size
      distributions were performed using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-ZS.<br>

      <b>Xylem Structure and Rationale for use of Conifer Xylem</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The flow of sap in plants is driven primarily by transpiration
      from the leaves to the atmosphere, which creates negative pressure
      in the xylem. Therefore, xylem evolution has occurred under
      competing pressures of providing minimal resistance to the flow of
      sap, while protecting against cavitation (i.e. nucleation) and
      growth of bubbles that could stop the flow of sap and kill the
      plant, and to do this while maintaining mechanical strength [7].
      The xylem structure comprises many small conduits that work in
      parallel and operate in a manner that is robust to cavitation [7],
      [8] (Figure 1). In woody plants, the xylem tissue is called the
      sapwood, which often surrounds the heartwood (i.e. inactive,
      non-conducting lignified tissue found in older branches and
      trunks) and is in turn surrounded by the bark (Figure 1b,c). The
      xylem conduits in gymnosperms (conifers) are formed from single
      dead cells and are called tracheids (Figure 1c), with the largest
      tracheids reaching diameters up to 80 µm and lengths up to 10 mm
      [7]. Angiosperms (flowering plants) have xylem conduits called
      vessels that are derived from several cells arranged in a single
      file, having diameters up to 0.5 mm and lengths ranging from a few
      millimeters to several meters [7]. These parallel conduits have
      closed ends and are connected to adjacent conduits via “pits” [8]
      (Figure 1d,e). The pits have membranes with nanoscale pores that
      perform the critical function of preventing bubbles from crossing
      over from one conduit to another. Pits occur in a variety of
      configurations; Figure 1d,e shows torus-margo pit membranes that
      consist of a highly porous part shaped like a donut (margo) and an
      impermeable part in the center called torus, occurring in conifers
      [8]. The porosity of the pit membranes ranges in size from a few
      nanometers to a few hundred nanometers, with pore sizes in the
      case of angiosperms tending to be smaller than those in
      gymnosperms [8], [9]. Pit membrane pore sizes have been estimated
      by examining whether gold colloids or particles of different sizes
      can flow through [8], [10]. Remarkably, it was observed that 20 nm
      gold colloids could not pass through inter-vessel pit membranes of
      some deciduous tree species [10], indicating an adequate size
      rejection to remove viruses from water. Furthermore,
      inter-tracheid pit membranes were found to exclude particles in
      the 200 nm range [8], as required for removal of bacteria and
      protozoa.<br>

      comprises radial spoke-like structures that suspend the torus,
      which are only barely visible overlaying the cell wall in the

      amplification, defined as the pit membrane area divided by the
      nominal filter area, on the tracheid aspect ratio L/D and
      fractional area a occupied by pit membranes.<br>
      <br>
      Since angiosperms (flowering plants, including hardwood trees)
      have larger xylem vessels that are more effective at conducting
      sap, xylem tissue constitutes a smaller fraction of the
      cross-section area of their trunks or branches, which is not ideal
      in the context of filtration. The long length of their xylem
      vessels also implies that a large thickness (centimeters to
      meters) of xylem tissue will be required to achieve any filtration
      effect at all – filters that are thinner than the average vessel
      length will just allow water to flow through the vessels without
      filtering it through pit membranes (Figure 1a). In contrast,
      gymnosperms (conifers, including softwood trees) have short
      tracheids that would force water to flow through pit membranes
      even for small thicknesses (&lt;1 cm) of xylem tissue (Figure 1a).
      Since tracheids have smaller diameters and are shorter, they offer
      higher resistance to flow, but typically a greater fraction of the
      stem cross-section area is devoted to conducting xylem tissue. For
      example, in the pine branch shown in Figure 1b used in this study,
      fluid-conducting xylem constitutes the majority of the
      cross-section. This reasoning leads us to the conclusion that in
      general the xylem tissue of coniferous trees – i.e. the sapwood –
      is likely to be the most suitable xylem tissue for construction of
      a water filtration device, at least for filtration of bacteria,
      protozoa, and other pathogens on the micron or larger scale.<br>
      <br>
      The resistance to fluid flow is an important consideration for
      filtration. Pits can contribute a significant fraction (as much as
      30–80%) [7], [8] of the resistance to sap flow, but this is
      remarkably small considering that pit membrane pore sizes are
      several orders of magnitude smaller than the tracheid or vessel
      diameter. The pits and pit membranes form a hierarchical structure
      where the thin, highly-permeable pit membranes are supported
      across the microscale pits that are arranged around the
      circumference of the tracheids (Figure 1a). This arrangement
      permits the pit membranes to be thin, offering low resistance to
      fluid flow. Furthermore, the parallel arrangement of tracheids
      with pits around their circumference provides a high packing
      density for the pit membranes. For a given tracheid with diameter
      D and length L, where pit membranes occupy a fraction a of the
      tracheid wall area, each tracheid effectively contributes a pit
      membrane area of pDLa/2, where the factor of 2 arises as each
      membrane is shared by two tracheids. However, the nominal area of
      the tracheid is only pD2/4, and therefore, the structure
      effectively amplifies the nominal filter area by a factor of
      2a(L/D) (Figure 1f). The images in Figure 1c indicate that typical
      D ~ 10–15 µm and a ~ 0.2 yield an effective area amplification of
      ~20 for tracheid lengths of 1–2 mm. Therefore, for a filter made
      by cutting a slice of thickness ~L of the xylem, the actual
      membrane area is greater by a large factor due to vertical packing
      of the pit membranes. Larger filter thicknesses further increase
      the total membrane area, but the additional area of the membrane
      is positioned in series rather than in parallel and therefore
      reduces the flow rate, but potentially improves the rejection
      performance of the filter due to multiple filtration steps as
      shown in Figure 1a.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Construction of the Xylem Filter and Measurement of Flow Rate</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The xylem filter device was constructed by simply peeling off the
      bark and cambium from a section of the pine branch and inserting
      it into a tube (Figure 2a). Although a simple tube fastener could
      provide a leak-tight seal between the tube and the xylem, we used
      epoxy to ensure that there was no inadvertent leakage. When
      deionized water was loaded into the tube above the xylem and
      subjected to pressure in the 0.5–5 psi (3.45 to 34.5 kPa) range,
      we found that water readily flowed through the xylem. The flow
      rate was proportional to applied pressure (Figure 2b), which
      allowed for the extraction of the hydrodynamic conductivity K (m2
      Pa-1 s-1) of the filter, defined by(1) where Q is the volumetric
      flow rate (in m3 s-1) under pressure difference ?P across the
      filter, while l and A are the thickness and the cross-section area
      of the filter, respectively. The observed conductivities for three
      different filters were in the range of ~5–6×10-10 m2 Pa-1 s-1
      (Figure 2c), or equivalently, ~0.5–0.6 kg s-1 m-1 MPa-1 when
      defined with respect to mass flow rate of water.<br>

      b) Effect of applied pressure on the water flux through the xylem
      filter. <br>
      c) Hydrodynamic conductivity of the filter extracted at each
      measured pressure using the total filter cross-section area and
      thickness as defined by Equation 1. Error bars indicate ±S.D. for
      measurements on three different xylem filters.<br>
      <br>
      Biologists have performed similar flow rate measurements by
      cutting a section of a plant stem under water, flushing to remove
      any bubbles, and applying a pressure difference to measure the
      flow rate [11], [12]. Xylem conductivities of conifers [7]
      typically range from 1–4 kg s-1 m-1 MPa-1, which compares very
      well with the conductivities measured in our experiments. Lower
      conductivities can easily result from introduction of bubbles [11]
      or the presence of some non-conducting heartwood. We can therefore
      conclude that the flow rate measurements in our devices are
      consistent with those expected from prior literature on
      conductivity of conifer xylem.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Filtration of Pigment Dye</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      After construction of the filter, we tested its ability to filter
      a pigment dye with a broad particle size distribution. The red
      color of the feed solution disappeared upon filtration (Figure 3a)
      indicating that the xylem filter could effectively filter out the
      dye.<br>
      <br>

      compared to the filtrate (right). <br>
      b) Size distribution of the pigment particles in the feed and
      filtrate solutions measured by dynamic light scattering. <br>
      c) Dependence of the rejection on the particle size estimated from
      the data in (b). <br>
      d) Cross-section of the xylem filter after filtration. Scale is in
      centimeters and inches.<br>
      <br>
      Since the dye had a broad pigment size distribution, we
      investigated the size-dependence of filtration by quantifying the
      pigment size distribution before and after filtration using
      dynamic light scattering. We found that the feed solution
      comprised particles ranging in size from ~70 nm to ~500 nm, with
      some larger aggregates (Figure 3b). In contrast, the filtrate
      particle size distribution peaked at ~80 nm, indicating that
      larger particles were filtered out. In a separate experiment, we
      observed that 20 nm fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles could
      not be filtered by the xylem filter, confirming this size
      dependence of filtration. Assuming that pigment particles 70 nm or
      less in size were not rejected, the size distributions before and
      after filtration enable calculation of the rejection performance
      of the xylem filter as a function of particle size (Figure 3c). We
      find that the xylem filter exhibits excellent rejection for
      particles with diameters exceeding 100 nm, with the estimated
      rejection exceeding 99% for particles over 150 nm. Smaller
      particles are expected to pass through the larger porosity of the
      pit membrane: SEM images in Figure 1e indicate sub-micron spacing
      between the radial spoke-like margo membrane through which the
      pigment particles can pass, although the porosity is difficult to
      resolve in the SEM image.<br>
      <br>
      After filtration, we cut the xylem filter parallel to the
      direction of flow to investigate the distribution of dye in the
      filter. We observed that the dye was confined to the top 2–3
      millimeters of the xylem filter (Figure 3d), which compares well
      with the tracheid lengths on the millimeter scale expected for
      coniferous trees [7]. These results show that the majority of the
      filtration occurred within this length scale, and suggests that
      the thickness of the xylem filter may be reduced to below 1 cm
      while still rejecting the majority of the dye.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Filtration of Bacteria from Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Finally, we investigated the ability of the xylem filter to remove
      bacteria from water. As a model bacterium, we used fluorescently
      labeled and inactivated Escherichia coli bacteria that are
      cylindrical in shape with a diameter of ~1 µm. Use of
      fluorescently labeled bacteria enabled easy enumeration of their
      concentrations, and also allowed us to track the location in the
      xylem filter where they were trapped. Since filtration is
      dominated by size-exclusion at this length scale, we do not expect
      modification with the dye to significantly affect filtration
      characteristics. Filtration using three different xylem filters
      showed nearly complete rejection of the bacteria (Figure 4a).
      Using a hemacytometer to count the bacteria, we estimate that the
      rejection was at least 99.9%.<br>
      <br>

      a) Concentrations of bacteria in the feed and filtrate solutions.

      b) Fluorescence image of xylem filter cross-section showing
      accumulation of bacteria over the margo pit membranes. Scale bar
      is 20 µm. c) Low-magnification fluorescence image shows that
      bacteria are trapped at the bottoms of tracheids within the first
      few millimeters of the top surface. Scale bar is 400 µm. Arrow
      indicates top surface of the xylem filter and also the direction
      of flow during filtration. Autofluorescence of the xylem tissue
      also contributes to the fluorescence signal in (b) and (c). d), e)
      SEM images showing bacteria accumulated on the margo pit membranes
      after filtration. Scale bars are 10 µm and 2 µm, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      To investigate the mechanism of filtration, the xylem filter was
      cut parallel to the direction of flow after filtration. When
      examined under a fluorescence microscope, we observed that the
      bacteria accumulated over the donut-shaped margo pit membranes
      (Figure 4b). This distribution is consistent with the expectation
      that the bacteria are filtered by the porous margo of the pit
      membranes. The distribution of trapped bacteria was not uniform
      across the cross section of the filter. Similar to the case of the
      dye, bacteria were observed only within the first few millimeters
      from the end through which the solution was infused (indicated by
      the white arrow in Figure 4c). In addition, the low-magnification
      fluorescence image shows that the bacteria had accumulated
      primarily over pit membranes at the bottom of the tracheids, which
      is again not unexpected. Further investigation by SEM clearly
      showed individual bacterial cells accumulated on the pit membranes
      over the porous margo (Figure 4d,e). These results confirm the pit
      membranes as the functional units that provide the filtration
      effect in the xylem filter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Wood has been investigated recently as a potential filtration
      material [13], showing moderate improvement of turbidity. While we
      showed filtration using freshly cut xylem, we found that the flow
      rate dropped irreversibly by over a factor of 100 if the xylem was
      dried, even when the xylem was flushed with water before drying.
      We also examined flow through commercially available kiln-dried
      wood samples cut to similar dimensions. Wood samples that
      exhibited filtration showed two orders of magnitude smaller flow
      rates than in the fresh xylem filter, while those that had high
      flow rates did not exhibit much filtration effect and seemed to
      have ruptured tracheids and membranes when observed under SEM.
      Wetting with ethanol or vacuuming to remove air did not
      significantly increase the flow rate in the wood samples that
      exhibited the filtration effect, suggesting that the pit membranes
      may have a tendency to become clogged during drying. These results
      are consistent with literature showing that the pit membranes can
      become irreversibly aspirated against the cell wall, blocking the
      flow [14]. In fact, the pit membranes in the SEM images (Figure
      1d,e and Figure 4d,e), which were acquired after drying the
      samples, appear to be stuck to the walls. Regardless, our results
      demonstrate that excellent rejection (&gt;99.9%) of bacteria is
      possible using the pit membranes of fresh plant xylem, and also
      provide insight into the mechanism of filtration as well as
      guidelines for selection of the xylem material.<br>
      <br>
      Peter-Varbanets et al. [2] have outlined the key requirements for
      point-of-use devices for water disinfection: <br>
      <br>
      a) performance (ability to effectively remove pathogens), <br>
      b) ease of use (no time-consuming maintenance or operation steps),
      <br>
      c) sustainability (produced locally with limited use of chemicals
      and non-renewable energy), and <br>
      d) social acceptability. <br>
      <br>
      Meeting all of these requirements has proved to be challenging,
      but point-of-use methods that have been successfully used for
      low-cost water treatment in developing countries include
      free-chlorine/solar disinfections, combined coagulant-chlorine
      disinfection, and biosand/ceramic filtrations [5]. While chlorine
      is a very effective biocide, its reaction with organic matter can
      produce carcinogenic by-products [15] and some waterborne
      pathogens such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Mycobacterium avium
      are resistant to the chlorine [16]. Solar disinfection based on
      ultraviolet irradiation can effectively inactivate C. parvum, but
      this requires low turbidity of source water [17] and is not
      effective for control of viruses [16]. Filtration based on biosand
      and ceramic filters is also effective at removing pathogens, but
      the effectiveness against viruses is low or unknown [18].
      Coagulation combined with chlorine disinfection removes or
      inactivates viruses and pathogens effectively. However, necessity
      of an additional filtration step and relatively high cost are
      potential barriers for practical use [18]. Among these methods, a
      review on field studies by Sobsey et al. [5] suggested that
      biosand and ceramic filtration are the most effective methods in
      practice, because once the apparatus is installed, the effort for
      use and dosage is significantly reduced and therefore promotes
      persistent use compared to disinfection approaches. Although
      membrane-based filtration is the most widely used for water
      treatment in industrialized nations and the cost of membranes has
      significantly decreased, membranes are still unaffordable to poor
      communities in the developing world [2]. Ultrafiltration systems
      run by hydrostatic pressure [19] and some recently invented
      point-of-use devices using ultrafiltration membranes may provide
      water to developing regions at reasonable cost [2]. However,
      membranes still require specialized chemicals and processes for
      manufacture, and need cleaning or replacement.<br>
      <br>
      Xylem filter technology could be an attractive option for low-cost
      and highly efficient point-of-use water treatment by filtration,
      overcoming some of the challenges associated with conventional
      membranes. Xylem filters could provide the advantage of reduced
      human effort compared to existing point-of-use water treatment
      options, requiring only simple periodic filter replacement. In
      addition, the pressures of 1–5 psi used here are easily achievable
      using a gravitational pressure head of 0.7–3.5 m, implying that no
      pumps are necessary for filtration. The measured flow rates of
      about 0.05 mL/s using only ~1 cm2 filter area correspond to a flow
      rate of over 4 L/d, sufficient to meet the drinking water
      requirements of one person [20]. This is comparable to
      chlorination and biosand filtration, which have the highest
      production rates of prevalent point-of-use water treatment
      methods, and far exceeds typical production rates for solar
      disinfection. Xylem filters could potentially be produced locally
      and inexpensively, and disposed of easily owing to their
      biodegradability. The high flow rates and low cost would certainly
      help address the issues of maintenance and replacement. For
      example, 200 filters of 10 cm2 area and 0.5 cm thickness could be
      packaged into a volume of about 1 L, which will be inexpensive and
      last a few years even with weekly replacement. Furthermore, as
      suggested by the dye filtration experiment, xylem filters should
      be able to significantly reduce water turbidity, enhancing the
      aesthetic qualities of the drinking water, which is hardly
      achieved by chlorination and solar disinfection.<br>
      <br>
      Wood is an easily available material. While use of fresh xylem
      does not preclude its use as a filter material, dried membranes
      have definite practical advantages. Therefore, the process of wood
      drying and its influence on xylem conductivity needs further
      study. In particular, processes that yield intact yet permeable
      xylem tissues that can be stored long-term will be helpful for
      improving the supply chain if these filters are to be widely
      adopted. In addition, flow through xylem of different plants needs
      to be studied to identify locally available sources of xylem,
      which will truly enable construction of filters from locally
      available materials. In the present study, we report results using
      xylem derived from only one species. These xylem filters could not
      filter out 20 nm nanoparticles, which is a size comparable to that
      of the smallest viruses. It will be interesting to explore whether
      there exist any coniferous species that have pit membranes with
      smaller pore sizes that can filter out viruses, or whether conifer
      xylem can be impregnated with particles such as carbon black to
      improve rejection of viruses. In their absence, angiosperms with
      short vessels that yield practical filter lengths may be the best
      alternative due to their smaller pit membrane pore sizes [8].
      Further exploration of xylem tissues from different plants with an
      engineering perspective is needed to construct xylem filters that
      can effectively reject viruses, exhibit improved flow rates, or
      that are amenable to easy storage. It is also conceivable that
      plants could be selected or developed for enhanced filtration
      characteristics, as has been the norm in agriculture for
      enhancement of many desirable characteristics including resistance
      to pests, flavor, or productivity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Plant xylem is a porous material with membranes comprising
      nanoscale pores. We have reasoned that xylem from the sapwood of
      coniferous trees is suitable for disinfection by filtration of
      water. The hierarchical arrangement of the membranes in the xylem
      tissue effectively amplifies the available membrane area for
      filtration, providing high flow rates. Xylem filters were prepared
      by simply removing the bark of pine tree branches and inserting
      the xylem tissue into a tube. Pigment filtration experiments
      revealed a size cutoff of about 100 nm, with most of the
      filtration occurring within the first 2–3 mm of the xylem filter.
      The xylem filter could effectively filter out bacteria from water
      with rejection exceeding 99.9%. Pit membranes were identified as
      the functional unit where actual filtration of the bacteria
      occurred. Flow rates of about 4 L/d were obtained through ~1 cm2
      filter areas at applied pressures of about 5 psi, which is
      sufficient to meet the drinking water needs of one person. The
      simple construction of xylem filters, combined with their
      fabrication from an inexpensive, biodegradable, and disposable
      material suggests that further research and development of xylem
      filters could potentially lead to their widespread use and greatly
      reduce the incidence of waterborne infectious disease in the
      world.<br>
