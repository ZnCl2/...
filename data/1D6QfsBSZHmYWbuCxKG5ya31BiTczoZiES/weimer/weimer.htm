        <i>A collaboration of Colorado-based researchers is taking the
          next step toward the synthesis of carbon-negative biofuels.</i><br>
        <br>
        <b>by </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Jessica Ebert</b><br>

      <b><br>
      </b>One of the drawbacks of biomass gasification systems is that
      the energy to power these reactors is typically drawn from
      coal-fired power plants. To produce a truly carbon-neutral, or
      even better, a carbon-negative fuel, the electricity to turn waste
      biomass feedstocks into a syngas, which can be further processed
      into fuels, must come from a renewable energy source.<br>
      <br>
      To that end, a team of scientists including engineers and
      horticulturists from the University of Colorado in Boulder,
      Colorado State University in Fort Collins and the National
      Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., have embarked on a
      project to develop rapid solar-thermal reactor systems for the
      conversion of biomass to syngas. The project is being funded by a
      three-year, $1 million USDA and U.S. DOE grant, which was
      announced in early March as part of an $18.4 million package to
      fund 21 biomass research and development demonstration projects.<br>
      <br>
      The collaboration is led by Alan Weimer, a professor at CU-Boulder
      and executive director of the Colorado Center for Biorefining and
      Biofuels who worked for Dow Chemical Co. for more than 16 years
      before pursuing a career in academia. At Dow, Weimer worked in the
      area of ultra high-temperature processing for the synthesis of
      fine materials like tungsten carbide, which is used in the
      manufacture of mining instruments and other high-tech tools. The
      materials were generated by flowing chemical precursors through a
      graphite reactor tube that is heated indirectly by electricity.<br>
      <br>
      When he joined the university's Department of Chemical and
      Biological Engineering, his first project was an extension of his
      earlier research, but rather than using electricity from the grid,
      his work involved using concentrated sunlight for chemical
      processing. "The process looks a lot like the technology developed
      at Dow except instead of heating with electricity, we use
      sunlight," Weimer explains. "We can achieve the same temperatures
      without generating any greenhouse gases."<br>
      <br>
      During these early studies, Weimer and colleagues established a
      relationship with the engineers at NREL who had designed what's
      called a high-flux solar furnace in the late 1980s.<br>
      <br>
      The furnace facility sits on top of a high, barren mesa and
      consists of two main components: a flat mirror called a heliostat
      that tracks the sun as it moves across the sky and a primary
      concentrator, which consists of a series of 25 curved,
      hexagonal-shaped mirrors. The large, 32-square meter (38-square
      yard) heliostat reflects sunlight onto the primary concentrator,
      which focuses the sun to a single point. "It's basically similar
      to using a magnifying glass to concentrate sunlight to a point,
      although we use mirrors instead of lenses," explains Carl Bingham,
      staff engineer at NREL. This concentrated sunlight, which has been
      reduced to a beam measuring 10 centimeters (4 inches) in diameter,
      is reflected a second time at a target area inside the test
      building where researchers run their experiments.<br>
      <br>
      "The original intent was to see what we could do with highly
      concentrated solar radiation," Bingham says. By tightening the
      focus of the sunlight or increasing its concentration,
      temperatures pushing greater than 2,000 degrees Celsius (3,632
      degrees Fahrenheit) can be reached. "The idea is that heating
      things with concentrated sunlight gets things very hot, very
      quickly," he says. In addition to scorching temperatures, the
      furnace allows for the selective heating of the sample surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      Bingham, who has worked on the solar furnace nearly since its
      inception, explains that the early experimentation involved
      materials synthesis including the application of films onto
      various substrates, the formation of silicon crystals, the
      development of new methods for bonding metal onto ceramics and the
      manufacture of fullerenes, which are carbon structures used in
      semiconductors, superconductors, high-performance metals and
      medical technologies.<br>
      <b><br>
        A New Research Path<br>
        <br>
      </b>Eventually, the NREL engineers started collaborating with the
      researchers from Boulder. "We developed an alliance with CU and
      started doing work in the hydrogen program, which is still going
      on today," Bingham says. This research involved splitting water
      into hydrogen and oxygen, which requires very high temperatures
      and special materials. "It's a difficult and challenging problem,"
      Weimer says. A challenge his team continues to tackle. However, it
      also led one of Weimer's graduate students to suggest an
      alternative research path.<br>
      <br>
      "He came in one day and said ?with all this interest in biomass, I
      bet biomass is a piece of cake compared with splitting water,'"
      Weimer recalls. He proceeded to collect some Kentucky bluegrass
      from outside the laboratory, grind it up and process it. "What we
      discovered was that at temperatures of about 1,200 degrees C
      (2,192 degrees F) the short, rapid pyrolysis or gasification in
      the presence of steam of the biomass, produced syngas with usage
      in excess of 90 percent of the biomass," he says. This is
      significant, Weimer explains, because conventional gasification
      processes require a partial oxidation of the feedstock, which
      leads to yield loss. In addition, the very rapid heating for a
      very short time prevented the formation of tars. This eliminates
      the need for cleaning the syngas before it's reformulated to fuel,
      which is a pricey capital cost for a biomass plant, Weimer says.<br>
      <br>
      At CU-Boulder, Weimer's students and staff work with two
      electrically-heated transport tube reactors. As biomass flows
      through the tube, either by itself or with some inert gas or
      steam, the feedstock is heated to high temperatures for only a few
      seconds. The kinetics of this reaction are closely monitored for
      various feedstocks and used to develop mathematical models that
      predict how the solar reactors at NREL should behave. These models
      are then used to design the reactors that will be used for on-sun
      demonstrations.<br>
      <br>
      This includes a secondary concentrator, which is a cone-shaped
      device that essentially wraps the sunlight around the reaction
      tube. The biomass is gasified as the tube absorbs the heat. "Our
      students build these reactors here in the shop in our department.
      They mount them on skids. They put the skids in the back of a
      pickup truck and drive up to NREL where they locate the reactors
      in the corner of the test building," Weimer explains.<br>
      <br>
      "With the biomass we're really in the sweet spot," Weimer
      explains. "The materials issues associated with the water
      splitting go away." But there are other challenges. The biggest of
      these is finding biomass feedstocks independent of the food chain.
      "At the conditions that we operate, however, we can handle huge
      variability in feedstocks," he says. Weimer's team has gasified
      grasses, sorghum and even lignin. "Our feedstock could be lignin,
      sawdust, forestry waste, spent grains from a brewery, switchgrass,
      corn stover, sorghum," he says. "It could also be municipal solid
      waste or paper. It could even be glycerin."<br>
      <br>
      The team is also planning to develop algae for gasification. "We
      see algae as an ideal feedstock," Weimer says. But rather than
      extracting oil from the microbes for the production of biodiesel,
      the algae themselves will serve as a biomass feedstock for the
      production of syngas. In addition to algae processing, researchers
      at CSU led by Yaling Qian are working to understand how
      switchgrass can be grown on marginal lands using brown water. "You
      could consider our process as a renewable, thermochemical
      sledgehammer," Weimer says.<br>
      <br>
      Another challenge is interfacing the on-sun gasification with the
      reforming of the syngas. This represents the other half of
      Weimer's research: the work to develop catalytic processes to do
      the seamless downstream reforming of the syngas to biofuel.<br>
      <br>
      These are the obstacles that Weimer aims to iron out in the next
      three years. However, "we don't envision any showstoppers for the
      conversion of biomass," he says. For one thing, the process is a
      small version of the system he worked on at Dow to synthesize
      materials. This process is now commercial and used in large scale
      to make advanced materials. "So we feel very comfortable that this
      design can be scaled up," he says. Weimer has also looked into the
      economics of building solar-powered biomass gasification and
      conversion plants and it looks encouraging, he says. For this
      current USDA/DOE funded project, Weimer and colleagues have teamed
      with several companies including Xcel Energy, Arizona Public
      Service, Abengoa Bioenergy and Copernican Energy Inc. Weimer
      expects interest in this type of research to continue to grow.<br>
      <br>
      "There's been a lot of funding-research emphasis on using
      concentrated sunlight to make electricity," Weimer says. "There's
      also been a lot of interest in biomass gasification. We operate at
      the interface of those technologies. Although there's typically
      not a lot of money at that interface, it has been recognized that
      when you operate at the interface, there's a huge opportunity for
      innovation."<br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>Biomass gasification is a potential route to renewable fuel
      production from a domestically produced source.&nbsp; In theory,<br>
      all forms of carbonaceous material could be used including energy
      crops, agricultural and forestry waste, or municipal waste.&nbsp;
      When biomass and steam are combined at high temperature they react
      to form synthesis gas, a mixture of H2, CO, and CO2.&nbsp; This
      synthesis gas can then be sent to a catalytic reactor where it is
      converted into a variety of fuels such as methanol, ethanol and
      gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      Currently, the only industrial scale processes to produce biofuels
      from biomass are the production of biodiesel from bio-oil, and
      fermentation of sugar cane and corn to produce ethanol.&nbsp; In
      both cases a high value feedstock is consumed.&nbsp; If renewable
      fuels are ever going to displace a significant portion of our
      fossil fuel consumption they need to be produced from a widely
      available biomass source.&nbsp; Cellulosic ethanol and other
      bioprocesses that can utilize cellulose are steps in the right
      direction, but they still only convert a fraction of the biomass
      feedstock into a useable fuel.&nbsp; Thermochemical conversion is
      an attractive route because all of the carbon in the feedstock can
      be utilized. <br>
      <br>
      In traditional gasification, 20-25% of the energy in the biomass
      is burned to provide the process heat(1).&nbsp; If air is used for
      combustion, this also dilutes the product stream with large
      amounts of nitrogen.&nbsp; Solar thermal gasification offers a
      solution to both of these problems by supplying process heat with
      an external, renewable, heat source.&nbsp; Another advantage of
      solar thermal gasification is the relative ease of obtaining high
      temperatures.&nbsp; Most of the research done on biomass
      gasification has been performed in the 500-1000 °C range and
      production of tar has been a significant issue.&nbsp; Operating at
      higher temperature (1000-1300 °C) allows for better heat transfer,
      faster reaction kinetics(2; 3), and the breakdown of unwanted
      tars(4; 5).<br>
      <br>
      In order for solar thermal gasification to become a commercial
      scale process, a detailed understanding of the important
      parameters associated with solar thermal reactor design must be
      developed.&nbsp; Our lab is working on optimizing the solar
      thermal receiver/reactor system for biomass gasification.&nbsp;
      This is a combined effort of detailed CFD modeling coupled with
      laboratory experiments in a tightly controlled environment and
      validation in a solar thermal environment.&nbsp; Our solar testing
      is conducted at NREL’s High Flux Solar Furnace shown in.&nbsp; We
      hope that these efforts will lead to a process for large scale
      reactor design that can be applied in a commercial setting.<br>

      </b>The Sundrop Fuels unique ultrahigh-temperature bioreforming
      process produces a higher yield of renewable liquid fuel per ton
      of biomass feedstock than any other production method. <br>
      <b><br>
        How it works<br>
        <br>
      </b>1. Cellulosic biomass material is delivered by entrained flow
      into Sundrop Fuels’ proprietary ultra-high temperature pressurized
      bioreforming system, which converts the material.&nbsp; Natural
      gas is used to power the radiation-driven bioreforming reactor,
      generating temperatures of more than 1,400 degrees Celsius (2,552
      degrees Fahrenheit).<br>
      <br>
      2. Hydrogen-rich natural gas is added after bioreforming to allow
      for a two-to-one hydrogen-to-carbon ratio – the chemical make-up
      necessary for transportation fuels that can be used in today’s
      internal combustion engines.&nbsp; This combination of converted
      biomass and additional hydrogen creates a renewable feed that is
      the key ingredient for Sundrop Fuels drop-in biogasoline.<br>
      <br>
      3. The renewable feed is converted into methanol using a
      commercially available catalyst process.<br>
      <br>
      4. Using a well-established commercial fuels synthesis process,
      the methanol that was created from the renewable feed is then made
      into in ready-to-use “green gasoline” – or more easily referred to
      as biogasoline.<br>
      <br>
      5. The Sundrop Fuels high-octane, drop-in biogasoline is blended
      and ultimately delivered to the marketplace through the nation’s
      existing pipeline and distribution infrastructure.<br>
      <b>&nbsp;<br>
        THE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND SUNDROP FUELS’ ULTRA-EFFICIENT CONVERSION
        OF BIOMASS TO LIQUID FUEL<br>
      </b><br>
      At the center of its advanced biofuels production is the Sundrop
      Fuels proprietary, ultra-high temperature pressurized bioreforming
      system.&nbsp; Inside a specially-designed thermochemical reactor,
      biomass is quickly converted, then combined with hydrogen from
      clean-burning natural gas to create a renewable feed stream – the
      key ingredient for biogasoline that is 100 percent compatible with
      today’s combustion engines and transportation fuels
      infrastructure.&nbsp; Sundrop Fuels first converts this renewable
      feed into methanol using a syngas-to-methanol process, then
      creates “green gasoline” using a commercially-established
      methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) fuels synthesis. <br>
      <br>
      Sundrop Fuels’ innovative bioreforming production method is unique
      from conventional biomass gasification in that it uses indirect
      radiation heat transfer to rapidly drive the extremely high
      temperatures needed to create the renewable gas feed, which is
      then processed to create liquid advanced cellulosic biofuel.&nbsp;
      Using natural gas, temperatures inside the Sundrop Fuels
      radiation-driven bioreformer reach more 1,400 degrees Celsius
      (2,552 degrees Fahrenheit) – hotter than lava flowing from a
      volcano.<br>
      <br>
      By steadily maintaining these ultra-high temperatures to drive the
      endothermic bioreforming reaction, the Sundrop Fuels process
      operates at an extraordinary high-efficiency, producing more yield
      of renewable liquid fuel per ton of biomass feedstock than any
      other production method.<br>
      <br>
      As importantly, the Sundrop Fuels biogasoline production path
      significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions as compared to the
      production of conventional petroleum fuels. Every gallon of
      Sundrop Fuels drop-in cellulosic advanced biofuel will generate
      RIN credits under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).<br>
      <br>
      Sundrop Fuels is currently in engineering design stage for its
      inaugural production facility located just outside of Alexandria,
      Louisiana – the first operational milestone in the company’s path
      toward becoming a mass-scale provider of renewable, drop-in
      biogasoline.&nbsp; When fully operational, Sundrop Fuels’ first
      facility will produce 15,000 barrels per day of finished,
      87-octane gasoline.&nbsp; It will also represent the world’s
      largest commercial production of cellulosic advanced biofuel using
      methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) technology, which was originally
      demonstrated as a commercially available process in the 1980s.<b><br>

      Baking biomass: Sundrop Fuels has built a solar gasification
      R&amp;D facility in Colorado.<br>
      <br>
      Sundrop Fuels, a startup based in Louisville, CO, says it has
      developed a cleaner and more efficient way to turn biomass into
      synthetic fuels by harnessing the intense heat of the sun to
      vaporize wood and crop waste. Its process can produce twice the
      amount of gasoline or diesel per ton of biomass compared to
      conventional biomass gasification systems, the company claims.<br>

      Gasification occurs when dry biomass or other carbon-based
      materials are heated to above 700 ºC in the presence of steam. At
      those temperatures, most of the biomass is converted to a
      synthetic gas. This “syngas” is made up of hydrogen and carbon
      monoxide, which are the chemical building blocks for higher-value
      fuels such as methanol, ethanol, and gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      But the heat required for this process usually comes from a
      portion of the biomass being gasified. “You end up burning 30 to
      35 percent of the biomass,” says Alan Weimer, a chemical
      engineering professor at the University of Colorado, Boulder.<br>
      <br>
      A few years ago, Weimer and his research team began looking at
      ways of using concentrated solar heat to drive the gasification
      process. It worked so well that Weimer and Chris Perkins, the
      graduate student who came up with the idea, went on to cofound
      Copernican Energy to commercialize the approach. Copernican was
      acquired by Sundrop Fuels in 2008, and its solar-reactor
      technology is now at the heart of a 1.5-megawatt thermal solar
      gasification demonstration facility in Colorado.<br>
      <br>
      The gasifier system consists of ceramic tubes that pass through a
      furnace. The gasifier is mounted atop a tower surrounded by a
      field of solar concentrating mirrors that reflect sunlight back to
      the furnace. As the biomass is dropped through the intensely hot
      ceramic tubes, it is vaporized into syngas.<br>
      <br>
      Weimer, a former Dow Chemical engineer, says the system is
      “agnostic” to the types of biomass it can process. “It’s like a
      sledgehammer because of the (1,200 to 1,300 ºC) temperatures it
      operates at,” he says, explaining that conventional gasification
      uses lower temperatures to try to minimize the volume of biomass
      used to fuel the process. But keeping the temperature lower poses
      another problem. Gasification at temperatures below 1,000 ºC
      leaves behind tar. “And that tar is expensive to get rid of,” says
      Weimer. “If you leave it in there, it will end up killing your
      catalysts downstream when you try to reform your product into
      (liquid) fuel.”<br>
      <br>
      The higher temperatures also make for a better quality syngas.
      Conventional gasification typically produces a syngas mixture
      that’s half hydrogen and half carbon monoxide. Sundrop’s process
      achieves a hydrogen-to-CO ratio of two to one.<br>
      <br>
      “I can tell you, the economics have been looked at quite
      extensively, and the idea of being able to produce gasoline at
      less than $2 a gallon without subsidies, we believe that’s a real
      number,” Weimer says. The financial upside is even greater if
      carbon pricing becomes a reality, because the solar-driven process
      results in a reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions compared to
      conventional fuel production. “The key now is to design a scalable
      solar reactor.”<br>
      <br>
      Ajay Dalai, an associate professor of chemical engineering at the
      University of Saskatchewan, says powering gasification with solar
      energy has merit but could prove tricky. “When you’re transferring
      the heat into the pipe, how do you make sure that it is
      distributed thoroughly through the biomass?” Controlling heat
      transfer and temperature levels will be key, he says.<br>
      <br>
      Wayne Simmons, chief executive officer of Sundrop Fuels, doesn’t
      underestimate the challenges to commercializing the technology. He
      acknowledges, for example, that the greatest biomass resources
      aren’t located where the greatest solar resources are. Still, some
      woody biomass does exist in the U.S. Southwest, where Sundrop
      plans to build its first commercial plant. States such as New
      Mexico and Arizona, for example, regularly thin their forests to
      lower the risk of forest fires. But to access more feedstock,
      Sundrop is also looking at transporting energy crops, such as
      switchgrass, by rail from as far north as Kansas and as far east
      as Texas.<br>
      <br>
      Construction on Sundrop’s first commercial facility is expected to
      begin this year. The company plans to couple its solar
      gasification plant with a pilot-scale biorefinery that can produce
      up to eight million gallons of transportation fuel annually. It’s
      targeting 2015 for a full-scale biorefinery that can produce 100
      million gallons a year.<br>
      <br>
      The company has attracted some key investors, including
      venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A improved solar biochar reactor, system including the reactor,
      and methods of forming and using the reactors and systems are
      disclosed. The methods and system as described herein provide
      sufficient solar energy to a biochar reactor to convert animal
      waste or other biomass to biochar in a relatively cost-effective
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present disclosure generally relates to thermal
      treatment systems and methods. More particularly, exemplary
      embodiments of the disclosure relate to systems and methods that
      use solar thermal processes to produce biochar from biomass.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Animal waste, such as human waste, can be an agent that
      carries and/or transmits infectious pathogens. Accordingly, such
      waste is often treated. Typical sewage treatment requires
      significant infrastructure and large-scale plants to treat the
      waste. Unfortunately, such systems may not be suitable in
      developing areas or where such large-scale, high-infrastructure
      systems are not practical.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Biochar reactors can be used to treat animal waste in areas
      where typical sewage treatment systems are not practical. A
      typical biochar production reactor relies on combustion of
      material to provide the necessary heat to convert biomass into one
      or more desired products. Unfortunately, use of combustion to heat
      the reactor may generate unwanted greenhouse gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Other bioreactors may rely on sunlight to produce requisite
      reactor temperatures for conversion of biomass to desired
      products. To achieve the requisite temperatures for such
      reactions, the solar reactors use concentrated sunlight. For
      example, a solar biochar reactor often includes a reactor located
      at a focus of an imaging optic, such as a parabola. Alternatively,
      solar furnaces or beam-down towers may be used; however,
      additional optical elements required for such systems increase the
      cost of the systems and the systems generally require
      sophisticated optical devices to achieve the suitably high solar
      concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Accordingly, improved solar biochar reactors and methods of
      forming and using the reactors are desired.<br>
      <br>

      discussed in greater detail below, in general, a method and system
      as described herein provide sufficient solar energy to a biochar
      reactor to convert animal waste or other biomass to biochar in a

      further include a carousel to transfer containers between a
      treatment area and a collection area.<br>
      <br>

      further aspects, the method includes condensing water vapor. And,
      in accordance with yet further aspects, the method includes
      removing condensable tars within pyrolysis gas using a removable

      pyrolysis gas using one or more of a biochar and activated carbon
      packed filter bed.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In accordance with yet additional exemplary embodiments of

      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0022] As set forth in more detail below, the present disclosure
      provides improved solar biochar reactors, systems including the
      reactors, and methods of forming and using the reactors and
      systems. The reactors, systems, and methods may be used to treat
      biomass, such as animal waste and convert the biomass to biochar,
      which may be used for various beneficial applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The systems and method described herein use concentrated
      sunlight to obtain desired operating temperatures within a
      reactor. In traditional solar thermal systems, the reactor or
      receiver is located at the focus of the imaging optic, which is
      typically a parabola. Several concepts have been proposed, and a
      few have been built, which utilize additional optical elements to
      redirect the concentrated beam to a more convenient location, such
      as on the ground level. These include solar furnaces and beam-down
      towers. Additional optical elements for this redirection drive up
      costs and require the use of sophisticated optical devices to
      achieve high concentrations. Thus, designing solar thermal
      reactors where their location is driven by process rather than
      optical requirements has not been a successful development path
      for large-scale applications. To overcome these issues, in
      accordance with various exemplary embodiments of the invention,
      concentrated sunlight is delivered via fiber optic cables from a
      concentrated source of sunlight to a reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The concept of solar concentrators using fiber optics for
      delivery of sunlight was first proposed over thirty years ago
      (Kato 1976); however, the successful demonstration of this
      approach was only made possible after the development of improved
      fiber optic technology for communications. The growth in use of
      fiber optics for a number of applications outside of solar enabled
      glass fibers of sufficient purity and low enough cost has spurred
      their use in solar thermal systems (Peill 1997, Zik 1999,
      Feuermann 1999). While certainly not a mainstream solar thermal
      approach, fiber optics-based systems have progressed enough to
      warrant a recent review article (Kandilli 2009). Small-scale
      demonstrations have been very encouraging and show the potential
      for both good performance and achievement of high temperature
      (Nakamura 2011).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] FIG. 1 illustrates a thermal treatment system 100 in
      accordance with exemplary embodiments of the disclosure. Thermal
      treatment system 100 includes a reactor 102, one or more fiber
      optic cables 104, a solar concentrator 108, having an area of
      concentrated solar power 106, and a container 110. In the
      illustrated example, concentrated sunlight is delivered to reactor
      102 via one or more fiber optic cables 104 (e.g. a fiber optic
      bundle) located at or proximate area of concentrated solar power
      106 (e.g., the focus of a parabolic concentrator 108) as shown in
      FIG. 1. Fiber optic cable 104 is fed to reactor 102 of the system
      100, where the various individual cables may terminate at, e.g.,
      the outside of the reactor or lid (e.g., between insulating
      material 114 and container 110). In this case, waste container 110
      is illuminated via radiation heat transfer, and container 110 is
      contained within insulated reactor 102. System 100 may
      additionally include a mirror 112 to concentrate the solar energy.
      A mirror size may range from, for example, about 2 m&lt;2 &gt;to
      about 100 m&lt;2 &gt;or about 2 m&lt;2 &gt;to about 50 m&lt;2&gt;.
      Compared to typical solar thermal reactors, where heat losses to
      the ambient environment are driven by radiation and convection,
      the illustrated reactor can achieve high temperatures with low
      solar input by limiting heat losses to conduction in the
      surrounding ground. In accordance with exemplary embodiments of
      the invention, at least some of the insulation may be movable. For
      example, a solar lid on reactor 102 may be coupled to fiber optic
      cables, and the lid can be removed or raised as material is
      collected in reactor 102 and then closed during treatment of the
      biomass material. See, e.g. system 700, below.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] A design of the solar concentrator may depend on a variety
      of factors, based on, for example, physical properties of the
      biomass or waste stream to be treated. An estimate of the energy
      input required for a family of 4 is from about 4,000 to about
      14,000 kJ, depending on specific reaction process and the
      temperature of that process. Energy inputs for families of 10 and
      shared toilets for 50 individuals are shown in Table 1. If 3 hours
      per day of solar operation are assumed, the power requirement is
      about 1300 W of net input to the reactor (using energy estimates
      for hydrothermal carbonization at 180[deg.] C. and accounting for
      conduction loss to the surrounding ground). For readily achievable
      values for concentrator reflectivity, secondary reflectivity,
      intercept factor, fiber bundle fill factor, fiber Fresnel
      reflections and fiber transmission, the solar efficiency can be
      estimated to be about 0.46. This efficiency with an average direct
      irradiance of 800 W/m&lt;2 &gt;over the operation period requires
      a mirror area of around 3.6 m&lt;2 &gt;(diameter about 2.1 m).
      This size is certainly small enough for use in a single family,
      developing community setting. Note that with higher efficiency,
      longer processing time or lower energy requirements, this size
      could be significantly reduced. A larger scale system supporting
      50 people could use an area of about 46 m&lt;2&gt;. This could be
      achieved with either multiple smaller units or a decreasing number
      of larger diameter concentrators. While a smaller family scale
      system may be desirable in some cases, intermediate and
      large-scale systems may be scaled for business management
      applications, where operations and maintenance can be integrated
      for savings.<br>

      [0027] The system and method described herein may be particularly
      suitable for a developing community environment. In this case,
      local materials can be used. The scale of such a system may depend
      on the degree to which the local labor force can be trained to
      build and operate the system, the availability of local materials,
      the cost for off-site versus local fabrication, and the overall
      economics of the concept as a business venture. Reactor 102 and
      solar receiving container 110 can be designed with solar power
      input scaled accordingly.<br>
      <br>

      container 202 and a second container 204, fiber optic cable 206, a

      a dry pyrolysis reactor system), and a waste receiver position
      236, where container 204 is in a collection position and waste
      receiver 202 in a treatment position. Systems in accordance with
      the present disclosure may also include a rotating mechanism to
      expose a reactor or portions thereof (e.g., a container) to one or
      more fiber optic cables.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In the illustrated system, first container 202 and a second
      container 204 can be switched between "collecting" and "treatment"
      positions, as shown in FIG. 2A. The containers may be switched
      using, for example a carousel to move the reactors-e.g., from the
      collection position to the treatment position. Although
      illustrated with only two containers 202, 204, systems in
      accordance with the present disclosure may include additional
      containers, which may be, for example on a carousel or track for
      easy moving between a treatment position and a collection
      position. Further, although not illustrated, systems in accordance
      with the present disclosure may include a trap for collecting
      condensing water vapor from a pyrolysis treatment rector, a
      removable tar trap for removing condensable tars within a
      pyrolysis reactor, and/or biochar and/or activated carbon to
      remove or filter odor-causing compounds.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Urine collected in urine collection container 234 may be
      treated using solar energy from one or more fiber optic cables 206
      or natural or otherwise concentrated sunlight-e.g., urine may be
      heat treated to temperature and time combinations that can render
      it disinfected. Alternatively, a means for continuously treating
      human fecal sludge using a solids-conveying system where an outer
      solar tube heats up an inner sheathed auger to produce char may be
      used. Alternatively, the urine could be treated using a thin film
      flow reactor using germicidal UV light (254 nm). Or, heat energy
      from the condensation of water vapor generated during solid waste
      treatment can be used to heat the urine to temperature and time
      combinations that can render it disinfected. In accordance with
      other aspects, a jacketed recirculation of urine around a
      pyrolysis reactor can be used to heat treat urine to temperature
      and time combinations that can render it disinfected.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] When a full collection container (e.g., container 202) is
      transferred (e.g., via a track and wheel system to a treatment
      (e.g., pyrolysis) zone, door 214 can be shut and sealed with a
      handle for the user, e.g., similar to a locking freezer door. The
      pyrolysis zone includes a gas discharge hole above the
      waste-filled collection container for product gases, roughly 14.2
      m&lt;3 &gt;of steam and 0.66 m&lt;3 &gt;of methane per day per
      family of four, that can be utilized onsite for heating and/or
      driving electrical generators for lighting and other minor
      electrical loads. For hydrothermal carbonization (1-ITC), the
      pyrolysis zone gas discharge can be fitted with a 20 psig
      pressure-relief valve to allow the reactor to maintain suitable
      reaction conditions of 180-220[deg.] C. and 18 psig. Fiber-optic
      cables carrying concentrated solar light can be fed into the walls
      of the pyrolysis zone (e.g., though walls 210), or through a lid
      of a container to heat the container up to reaction temperature
      ~400[deg.] C. for conventional pyrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 7 illustrates another system 700 in accordance with
      exemplary embodiments of the invention. Similar to systems 100 and
      200, system 700 includes a reactor 702, fiber optic cables 704, an
      area of concentrated sunlight 706, containers 708, 710, a carousel
      712 to switch containers 708, 712 between a collection area and a
      treatment area, a toilet 714, optionally including separate areas
      for solid 716 and liquid 718 collection, and a vent 720. All of
      the components of system 700 may be the same or similar to
      corresponding components of systems 100 and 200 as described
      herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] An estimated maximum energy requirement for the solar
      powered pyrolysis reaction is at about 14,000 kJ, assuming the
      system is used by 4 people per day (one household) operating at
      34.7 psia and 180[deg.] C. An estimated maximum energy
      requirement, for charring one person's daily waste at varying
      temperatures is shown in FIG. 3 for hydrothermal carbonization and
      in FIG. 4 for pre-dried and mixed pyrolysis in. Human waste is
      comprised mostly of water, 65% or more, which is energy intensive
      to heat and boil due to the high heat capacity of water.
      Approximately 12,800 kJ accounts for heating up wet feces to the
      boiling point of water and boiling the water off. The balance of
      heat accounts for estimated heat loss through the walls of the
      reaction zone to the surroundings. It is important to note that
      this energy estimate does not include any energy gained back from
      the exothermic pyrolysis reaction which would be driven by any
      air/O2 in the system. Exclusion of this energy return allows one
      to determine the maximum power requirement to achieve the reaction
      temperature. Table 2 lists assumed physical properties of an
      exemplary system, such as system 100 or 200.<br>

      [0034] The product gas stream of the system can be monitored in
      situ using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Gas
      products of pyrolysis are predominately CO2 and CH4 but other
      noxious gases will likely be present in dilute concentrations and
      to ensure that the reactor gases do not pose an environmental
      hazard to the user, adjustments can be made to the oxygen content
      of the reaction environment. Thus, a usable product for heating
      requirements in the single-user facility or at the local community
      level can be produced. The system may include additional controls
      to ensure proper temperature, pressure, and solar radiation
      control for the solar reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Exemplary materials of construction for the reactor include
      aluminum and stainless steel, both readily available and
      affordable. Reaction temperatures are unlikely to reach
      temperatures above the melting points of such metals or alloys.
      Additionally or alternatively, corrosion resistant materials such
      as stainless steel (Inconel, for example) that can also withstand
      high temperatures may be used. Several options for insulation may
      be suitable to reduce the energy losses to the environment
      surrounding the reactor (e.g., soil). Viable options include
      typical fiberglass insulation, ceramic fiber insulation (alumina
      or silica), and aerogels.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Design of the reactor may depend of a variety of factors,
      such as chemistry, namely hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and
      conventional pyrolysis, energy requirements, soil amendment
      characteristics and optimal use of nutrients as described below.
      Hydrothermal carbonization requires lower reaction temperatures,
      180-220[deg.] C. but pressures approaching 20 psig while
      conventional biomass pyrolysis takes place at atmospheric
      pressures but much higher temperatures, 400-800[deg.] C. (Libra,
      2011). The design of an HTC reactor addresses pressure and
      temperature control requirements. At increased pressures and
      temperatures, failure of the reactor wall could lead to a
      dangerous release in pressure. In both HTC and pyrolysis reactors,
      biomass conversion is an exothermic process, which carries
      increased risk of thermal runaway. Accordingly, reactor design
      accounts for the thermal properties of the respective system,
      including heat transfer, fluid flow, and time-dependent
      temperature profiles. Thermocouples, temperature controllers, and
      data acquisition software such as LabView or Matlab can be used to
      aide in the reactor design. Real-time analysis of the gas species
      generated during pyrolysis is used to optimize reaction conditions
      and, ultimately, the utility of the biochar. These data are
      obtained with the use of GC-MS. Evaluations of HTC and
      conventional pyrolysis can balance energy requirements with
      nutrient recovery as well as product quality and utility of
      by-product gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] An exemplary system may include a pyrheliometer-a device
      that accurately measures direct solar irradiance. Solar irradiance
      measurements may be desired to the optimization of the solar
      concentrator equipment and sun-tracking algorithms. Solar tracking
      can be accomplished via two pathways: closed- and open-loop
      control. Closed-loop control utilizes a sun-sensor, which is made
      up of several small cells around the base of a rod. Throughout the
      day, the shadow cast down onto the array changes and indicates the
      position of the sun in the sky. This system would be more
      expensive than open-loop but has the advantage of feedback control
      and less risk of error. The control system also includes a
      resolver or optical encoder to translate the data from the
      tracking system into a command for motors to adjust the position
      of the solar concentrator(s). Open-loop control involves motors
      that will adjust the solar collectors according to a
      pre-determined program based on latitude, longitude, date and
      time. This approach, though more affordable, has a high risk of
      error and may require extra maintenance and monitoring from a
      trained technician. If solar tracking is desired, a small PV
      system may be used to power the tracking motor.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Biochar, a value added product from the system and method
      described herein, has been utilized to improve agricultural soil
      fertility, sequester carbon, control transport of environmental
      contaminants, and remove pesticides as a water filter media
      (although the latter is not envisioned as a use for the latrine
      waste biochar). The processes for generation of biochar also
      produce gases that can be used as cooking and heating fuel or
      supplemental energy for the biochar production.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Biochar applied to soil can improve soil structure, water
      retention and lower the acidity of the soil (Winsley, 2007).
      Biochar material has high surface area which is capable of
      supporting microbiota and encouraging healthy biological activity
      in the soil. These microbiota act as catalysts in reducing
      nitrogen loss, making nutrients more available to plants. Biochar
      is made up of 70-80% carbon, a much more condensed quantity when
      compared to the biomass it is generated from. When it is placed in
      the soil, this carbon is permanently sequestered in this highly
      stable form for a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
      (Roberts, 2010). For this reason it has been proposed as an avenue
      for carbon sequestration credits and therefore these systems could
      be proliferated (multiplied to many locales) by revenue generated
      from selling carbon credits.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Two major factors that may impact the quality of a biochar
      include manufacturing conditions and the biomass (feedstock) used.
      Exemplary manufacturing methods include pyrolysis and hydrothermal
      carbonization (HTC) as these achieve high mass yield during the
      process and generate biochar with characteristics good for soil
      amendment (Funke &amp; Ziegler, 2010; Winsley, 2007; Kumar &amp;
      Gupta, 2009). Pyrolysis of animal waste and wastewater sludge have
      shown to generate effective biochar for soil amendments; more
      effective in agricultural field studies than cellulose/wood based
      feedstock (Meyer et al., 2011; Libra et al., 2011; Steinbeiss,
      2009). A potential for generation of fuel from the gases created
      during pyrolysis has also been documented (Ro et al., 2010). One
      study has been conducted which evaluates pyrolysis of fresh human
      waste (US Army, 1974). This study verified that human waste could
      be converted into a more compact and sterile material.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] For the reactor design, HTC has the advantage that no
      energy intensive pre-drying is necessary and because the waste is
      mixed (the waste includes solids and urine) it is thought that
      nutrients from the urine (as urine contains at least triple the
      mass of N, P and K of feces) will be taken up by the biochar,
      which would produce a nutrient enhanced biochar. Dry pyrolysis
      does not require a pressure rated reaction vessel and can be
      designed to use passive solar drying or rapid dewatering as the
      first phase of the solar pyrolysis process.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In the case of HTC, biochar can be generated in a
      pressure-rated metal reaction vessel and heated to the desired
      temperature under autogeneous pressure. The temperatures may range
      from about 150-300[deg.] C., with 200[deg.] C. expected to be
      optimal (Libra et al., 2011). The residence times at these
      temperatures range from about 10 to 90 minutes. For dry pyrolysis,
      the wet urine and fecal material can be collected in an open
      vessel and placed in an oven to be heated to the desired
      temperature. Dry pyrolysis will require higher temperatures
      between about 400-800[deg.] C. and the residence time will also be
      much greater because pyrolysis cannot begin until the liquid is
      evaporated away. Once the feedstock is dried to constant mass,
      subsequent pyrolysis times range from about 30 to 90 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Ultimate and proximate analysis of the char can be
      conducted, including C, N, H, S, elemental analysis, fixed carbon,
      moisture content, volatile matter, and ash content. Macro and
      micronutrients can be quantified by following ashing-digestion
      protocol and analyzing the samples with an Axial Spectrometer (P
      and K can be measured using an inductively coupled plasma (ICP)
      atomic emissions spectroscopy (AES)). The biochar product can be
      analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) to
      examine pore structure. Surface area of all resulting biochar can
      be measured using the method of Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET).
      Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) can be conducted as well as
      Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis in order to isolate the
      types of functional groups before and after charring.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] It is expected that the biochar yield will be 45-60% for
      HTC and 20-35% for dry pyrolysis. The oxygen to carbon (O/C) ratio
      should decrease in the conversion to biochar and the HTC generated
      biochar will have a higher O/C ratio compared to that of dry
      pyrolysis. The abundance of oxygen-rich organic compounds on the
      surface of the biochar generated by HITC adds cation exchange
      capacity (Kumar, 2011). In general a successful soil amendment
      should have an O/C ratio of less than 0.2 (Spokas, 2010), a
      volatile matter content less than 20% (Deenik, 2010), and a BET SA
      of at least 15 m&lt;2&gt;/g. (Brewer et al., 2011). Additionally,
      biochar successful as a soil amendment should exhibit a low
      intrinsic pH, high aromaticity, and lower ash content (Brewer et
      al., 2011). It is expected that higher amounts of nitrogen and
      phosphorus will be found in the HTC biochar as the urine is
      combined with feces. There is evidence of higher nitrogen content
      with wastewater sludge processed by HTC, but never with mixed
      fresh human excreta (Hossain et al. 2010). The option of
      separation of urine and feces may determine biochar quality,
      energy requirements and nutrient recovery optimization.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Pyrolysis of the combined urine and feces may mineralize
      the nutrients found in human excreta, such as nitrogen,
      phosphorus, and potassium, making them bioavailable for plants. At
      a biochar yield of 45%, an ideal 9 g of nitrogen and 1 g of
      phosphorus could be recovered per person per day through the HTC
      process (Torondel, 2010). Nitrogen and phosphorus recovery from
      urine alone has been demonstrated through the use of solar thermal
      evaporation from exposure to direct sunlight. A pilot-scale study
      evaporating 50 L of undiluted urine yielded 360 g of fertilizer
      (2% nitrogen and 2% phosphorus by weight), equaling approximately
      0.2 g of nitrogen and 0.2 g of phosphorus per person per day. The
      urine-derived fertilizer led to biomass yields and nutrient
      uptakes comparable to those from commercial fertilizers (Antonini
      2012).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Potential benefits of urine separation can be weighed
      alongside the added cost of separate urine purification. In the
      event that urine is separated for nutrient recovery, pathogens may
      desirably be inactivated by heat. This scenario may also consider
      fecal contaminants due to the potential for fecal
      cross-contamination during urine collection (WHO, 2006). Enteric
      viruses are killed rapidly at temperatures of 60[deg.] C.
      Entamoeba hystolytica cysts and hookworm eggs are killed after
      five minutes at 50[deg.] C. Schistosome eggs require one hour at
      50[deg.] C. and Taenia eggs 10 minutes at 59[deg.] C. Bacteria
      such as Vibrio cholerae and E. coli are killed rapidly above 55 or
      60[deg.] C. respectively and Salmonella requires 15 to 20 min at
      60[deg.] C. (Feachem 1980, Gottas 1956). Therefore, in the event
      that urine is separated for nutrient recovery, a temperature of at
      least 65[deg.] C. can be used for pathogen inactivation. This
      temperature is practical to achieve outside of the reactor through
      a passive solar thermal process. Additionally, flowing
      source-separated urine through a parabolic reflector could take
      advantage of natural UVB rays from the sun for pathogen
      inactivation (Mbonimpa 2012). Exemplary systems include thermal
      and/or natural UV inactivation of pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Both the initial human waste and biochar produced can be
      tested for indicator organisms of known pathogens. The material
      can be diluted into suspension and inoculated with the appropriate
      culture for each type of bacteria, including mesophile,
      thermophile, the organic decomposition bacteria, coliform
      bacteria, fecal coliform, E. coli salmonella and enterococci.
      Additional testing can be conducted for regrowth of indicator
      organisms during storage of biochar and more advanced testing for
      thermotolerant spores and cysts. Reactor exhaust can be analyzed
      for major hydrocarbons, sulfur containing gases, carbon monoxide,
      carbon dioxide and higher heating values. This analysis can be
      done with a GC-MS. This may provide information regarding whether
      the gases generated in either method present a health risk to the
      user or if they can be effectively harnessed as an energy source.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Various factors that can improve the performance of the
      system include: the tracking performance, reaction time, and
      insulation. In accordance with exemplary embodiments, the system
      exhibits hygienic reliability in terms of disinfecting waste on a
      consistent manner under a given environmental condition without
      the need for daily adjustments. An exemplary system also provides
      safe thermal, pressure and gaseous conditions by monitoring these
      inside the user compartment of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Individual components which may be optimized for
      performance and cost include the solar collectors, any necessary
      tracking system, the reaction chamber, and the biochar production
      process. Additionally the biochar may be evaluated for soil
      amendment capabilities as well as nutrient value.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In evaluating the cost of a waste treatment system, a life
      cycle approach may be taken that considers not just construction
      costs, but also costs related to the sustainable delivery of a
      sanitation service. The system may be maintained to ensure that
      the service level remains the same as originally intended. Thus
      "costs" refer to expenditures incurred by the household or
      community (in case of the public toilet/system) for construction,
      operation and maintenance, and rehabilitation. This analysis helps
      one understand cost drivers so as to enable more cost effective
      service delivery. The benefits, which include elimination of costs
      associated with emptying, transporting, treating and disposing of
      traditional latrine human waste material as well as the value
      added material can be balanced against the costs of the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Table 3 shows cost estimates for system components,
      annualized and reported as a cost per person per day (6% discount
      rate and 20 year life). The scenarios analyzed range from
      household systems (for 4 and 10 individuals) to shared community
      systems (50 individuals). An estimate of the cost of small-scale
      solar concentrator systems using fiber optics is in the range of
      $200-500/m&lt;2 &gt;with an average of $350/m&lt;2 &gt;used in the
      calculations. The size and cost associated with the solar
      concentrator system for each biochar production method are shown
      in Table 3. Other system costs include the solar reactor, toilet
      base structure and superstructure. The cost estimate for the
      reactor associated with each system size depends on the desired
      temperature of reaction and orientation/automation of the
      collection area below the toilet. Assuming a reactor design
      without costly automation and with the use of aluminum or
      stainless steel; a system that serves 4 people is estimated to
      cost $230 for aluminum or $545 for stainless steel. A system
      serving 50 people would require a larger reactor for pyrolysis and
      is estimated at $700 for aluminum or $1635 for stainless. The
      construction of the collection area and the platform on which to
      stand in the bathroom can be designed and built out of local
      materials, e.g., reinforced concrete and brick/mortar; estimated
      at $100. The superstructure can be largely up to the users, but
      could likely be safe and private for less than $50. Table 3 shows
      that the final cost per person per day for these toilet systems
      are in the range of $0.03-0.10, indicating that the system has a
      very feasible economic outlook.<br>

      [0052] The value of the products produced can also be factored
      into the economic picture. Biochar is incorporated at a
      conservative price of $57 per ton, based on biochar without any
      nutrient content (McCarl et al., 2008). Assuming 400 g of feces
      per person and a 50% mass yield during the pyrolysis process, a
      daily value for biochar was calculated. It was calculated that
      0.17 m&lt;3 &gt;of methane is produced per person per day and this
      added value is incorporated into Table 4 at a cost of $80 per
      1,000 m&lt;3 &gt;(IndexMundi, 2012). In the case of urine
      diversion and purification, the product has a high nutrient value
      and a current price of $506/ton ammonium nitrate (34% N) and
      $665/ton of a 45% super phosphate (USDA 2012). Table 4 shows the
      overall value of the products produced in one day from the system
      designs described herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The technology can serve individual families but
      additionally could be more economical in peri-urban communities.
      Depending on the value of the value added products, shared
      community toilets could generate a large amount of nutrient
      infused biochar as well as be a site for additional community
      services such as a kitchen, served by the flammable gases produced
      during the pyrolysis process. Additionally, maintenance could be
      paid for by biochar or nutrient sales to rural areas, carbon
      credits associated with biochar and toilet system user fees.<br>

      [0054] The alternatives for the system design desirably include
      ease of use and maintenance, safety, affordability, and cultural
      appropriateness in regards to sanitation practices. A squat or a
      pedestal/sitting toilet design can be used depending on the
      cultural preference of end users. For the dry pyrolysis
      application, a urine diversion variant toilet can be used. The
      toilet seat may have a slightly elevated position above the floor
      to minimize water or other cleaning liquid entering the
      receiver/reactor through the input holes. Foot operated hole seals
      may be provided to minimize odor and help keep liquid out. A
      latrine floor may be made of smooth, polished, and durable
      materials to minimize odor causing adsorption and facilitate
      cleaning (Rieck, Muench, 2011). Floor drains may be provided to
      avoid the possibility of reactor/receiver area flooding as some
      users may utilize the restroom as a bath/shower space for lack of
      other space. Wind driven ventilation may be used to keep odor to
      an acceptable level. If desired, however, wood ash, lime, sawdust,
      soil, etc. can be used to cover fresh excreta. The user may
      slide/guide the reactor/receiver to the location of the reactor
      lid and secure the lid in place. This can be done routinely, e.g.,
      every evening after transferring the pyrolysis end product to
      storage for later sale/use. The use of guides to move the
      reactor/receivers reduces accidental spilling of raw excreta. For
      the safety of the user, a temperature measurement unit may be
      installed to ensure that the reactor contents are cool enough to
      open. Periodically the user may be expected to replace the o-ring
      seals that help maintain a pressure seal for the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Turning now to FIG. 5, a method 500, which has been
      described above, is illustrated. Method 500 includes the steps of
      providing a solar collector to obtain concentrated solar thermal
      energy (step 502), providing a reactor (step 504), providing
      biomass to the reactor (step 506), providing concentrated solar
      thermal energy to the reactor using one or more fiber optic
      cables, (step 508) and treating the biomass with the concentrated
      solar thermal energy (step 508). Step 502 may include providing
      any suitable solar collector, such as concentrator 108. Step 504
      may include providing any suitable reactor, such as reactor 102,
      208, or 702. Providing biomass, step 506, may include, for
      example, providing animal waste, such as human waste, to the
      reactor. Concentrated solar thermal energy is provided to a solar
      reactor during step 508 using the techniques described
      herein-e.g., using fiber optic cables with fused fiber ends,
      terminating the end of the fibers prior to reaching the container,
      and the like. Method 500 may additionally include additional
      steps, as described herein, including rotating a carousel to
      expose the reactor to one or more fiber optic cables, using
      hydrothermal carbonization or pyrolysis, removing condensable tars
      within pyrolysis gas using a removable tar trap prior to further
      treatment or use of a gas, removing odor causing compounds from
      the pyrolysis gas using one or more of a biochar and activated
      carbon packed filter bed, and separately or not treating urine.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] FIG. 6 illustrates another method 600 in accordance with
      yet additional embodiments of the invention. Method 600 includes
      providing a waste treatment system comprising a solar collector
      and a reactor (step 602), wherein the reactor receives
      concentrated solar energy from the solar collector, exposing solid
      waste to the concentrated solar energy in the reactor to produce
      char (step 604); and exposing liquid waste to one or more of
      concentrated and passive solar energy to treat the liquid waste
      (step 606). The steps of method 600 may employ any of the
      corresponding techniques described herein. For example, step 602
      may include providing a system as described in connection with
      FIG. 1 or FIG. 2A or 2B. Step 604 may include exposing solid waste
      in a container to concentrated sunlight as described in connection
      with FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B. And step 606 may include any of the urine
      treatment techniques described herein.<br>

      In an embodiment, a method of conducting a high temperature
      chemical reaction that produces hydrogen or synthesis gas is
      described. The high temperature chemical reaction is conducted in
      a reactor having at least two reactor shells, including an inner
      shell and an outer shell. Heat absorbing particles are included in
      a gas stream flowing in the inner shell. The reactor is heated at
      least in part by a source of concentrated sunlight. The inner
      shell is heated by the concentrated sunlight.; The inner shell
      re-radiates from the inner wall and heats the heat absorbing
      particles in the gas stream flowing through the inner shell, and
      heat transfers from the heat absorbing particles to the first gas
      stream, thereby heating the reactants in the gas stream to a
      sufficiently high temperature so that the first gas stream
      undergoes the desired reaction(s), thereby producing hydrogen or
      synthesis gas in the gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] In general, the disclosure relates to solar-thermal
      reactors and processes for carrying out high temperature chemical
      reactions. More particularly in an embodiment, it relates to a
      rapid-heating, short residence time solar-thermal process for
      carrying out highly endothermic dissociation reactions to produce
      hydrogen or hydrogen containing gases. Most particularly, in an
      embodiment it relates to those dissociation reactions wherein a
      solid particulate material is produced by the dissociation of a
      gaseous precursor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] There is a significant interest to develop benign processes
      for producing hydrogen that can be used as a fuel to power fuel
      cell vehicles. Such processes should reduce the amount of
      greenhouse gases produced, thus, minimizing impact on the
      environment. However, current methods for producing hydrogen incur
      a large environmental liability, because fossil fuels are burned
      to supply the energy to reform natural gas (primarily methane,
      CH4) to produce hydrogen (H2).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] High temperatures above approximately 1500 K are required
      for producing hydrogen and carbon black at high rates by the
      direct thermal dissociation of methane [CH4+heat--&gt;C+2H2]
      (reaction 1), ethane [C2H6+heat-&gt;2C+3H2] (reaction 2), propane
      [C3H8+heat--&gt;3C+4H2] (reaction 3), or, in general, a mixture of
      gases such as natural gas generically represented as CxHy
      [CxHy+heat--&gt;xC+(y/2)H2] (reaction 4).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Hydrogen can also be produced by the dry reforming of
      methane with carbon dioxide [CH4+CO2--&gt;2CO+2 H2]. It is also
      possible to carry out dissociation of methane simultaneously with
      the dry reforming of methane if excess methane is present relative
      to that required to react carbon dioxide. Such processes are
      useful since they can provide for a high hydrogen content
      synthesis gas by utilizing natural gas from natural gas wells that
      contain a high concentration of carbon dioxide (typically 10 to 20
      volume % CO2) or using landfill biogas (30 to 40 volume % CO2).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Hydrogen can also be produced by the thermal dissociation
      of hydrogen sulfide [H2S+heat--&gt;H2+S] (reaction 5).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] For these types of dissociation reactions, a solid (either
      C or S) is formed as a co-product (with H2) of the reaction.
      Often, the solid that is formed is in the state of fine particles.
      These particles have a tendency to deposit along the walls of
      reaction vessels or cooling chambers where the dissociation is
      occurring. If deposition occurs along the inside walls of the
      heated reactor, the particles tend to aggregate and crystallize.
      For the case of carbon deposition, the normally amorphous
      ultra-fine particles will grow in size and graphitize. Large
      graphitic carbon particles are less reactive compared to more
      amorphous fine sized particles and, hence, are of lower value.
      Furthermore, deposition on the reactor walls can cause plugging of
      the reactor and eventual shutdown of the process, thus, preventing
      continuous operation. In addition, carbon deposition on an outer
      transparent wall of a solar reactor can lead to overheating of the
      reactor wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] U.S. Pat. No. 4,552,741, to Buck et al., reports carbon
      dioxide reforming of methane in a system comprising two catalytic
      reactors. One of the catalytic reactors is heatable with solar
      energy. In the abstract, the reactors are stated to be "filled
      with a catalyst".<br>
      <br>
      [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,877 reports solar energy gasification
      of solid carbonaceous material in a liquid dispersion. The solid
      carbonaceous material is heated by solar energy and transfers heat
      to a surrounding liquid. Hydrogen is produced in the process by
      the decomposition/gasification of the hydrocarbon (coal)
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] EP 0675075A reports the use of solar energy to generate
      hydrogen from water. In the reported process, water is reduced to
      hydrogen with a metal, followed by reduction of the metal oxide
      with a reducing agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Hence, there is a need to develop high temperature
      environmentally benign processes for the production of H2 by
      thermal dissociation of hydrocarbon gases, such as natural gas,
      and to prevent the deposition of the products of dissociation on
      reactor walls.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] Various methods and apparatus are described for a high
      temperature chemical reactor. In an embodiment, a high temperature
      chemical reactor conducts a reaction process to that produces
      hydrogen or synthesis gas. The reactor may have at least two
      reactor shells, including an inner shell and an outer shell. The
      inner shell has an inlet and an outlet and the outer shell is
      nonporous and substantially encloses the second inner shell. A
      particle inlet provides heat absorbing particles in a first gas
      stream flowing in the inner shell. The reactor is heated at least
      in part by a source of concentrated sunlight. The inner shell is
      heated by the concentrated sunlight, and the inner shell
      re-radiates from the inner wall and heats the heat absorbing
      particles in the first gas stream flowing through the inner shell,
      and heat transfers from the heat absorbing particles to the first
      gas stream. The heat absorbing particles heats the reactants in
      the first gas stream to a sufficiently high temperature so that
      the first gas stream undergoes the desired reaction(s), thereby
      producing hydrogen or synthesis gas in the first gas stream.<br>

      [0019] While the invention is subject to various modifications and
      alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof have been shown by
      way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in
      detail. The invention should be understood to not be limited to

      <b>DETAILED DISCUSSION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] In an embodiment, a high temperature chemical reactor
      conducts a reaction process to that produces hydrogen or synthesis
      gas. The reactor may have at least two reactor shells, including
      an inner shell and an outer shell. The inner shell has an inlet
      and an outlet and the outer shell is nonporous and substantially
      encloses the second inner shell. A particle inlet provides heat
      absorbing particles in a first gas stream flowing in the inner
      shell. The reactor is heated at least in part by a source of
      concentrated sunlight. The inner shell is heated by the
      concentrated sunlight, and the inner shell re-radiates from the
      inner wall and heats the heat absorbing particles in the first gas
      stream flowing through the inner shell, and heat transfers from
      the heat absorbing particles to the first gas stream. The heat
      absorbing particles heats the reactants in the first gas stream to
      a sufficiently high temperature so that the first gas stream
      undergoes the desired reaction(s), thereby producing hydrogen or
      synthesis gas in the first gas stream. A solar concentrator
      designed to optimize an amount of solar thermal heating for the
      reaction process by using concentrated sunlight to transfer heat
      at extremely high rates by radiation heat transfer from the inner
      shell. The length of the inner shell and amount of flux provided
      by the solar concentrator are designed to carry out high
      temperature thermal dissociation reactions requiring rapid-heating
      and short residence times using solar energy<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The disclosure provides a method for carrying out high
      temperature thermal dissociation reactions requiring rapid-heating
      and short residence times using solar energy. In particular, the
      method of the disclosure allows production of hydrogen and
      hydrogen containing gases through thermal dissociation of a gas
      comprising hydrocarbon gases or mixtures thereof (such as natural
      gas) and/or hydrogen sulfide. The methods of the disclosure also
      allow production of hydrogen through dry reforming of methane with
      carbon dioxide. The disclosure also provides high temperature
      solar reactors.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In particular, the disclosure provides a high temperature
      solar-thermal reactor comprising<br>
      <br>
      [0023] a. a first inner shell which is at least partially porous,
      the first inner shell having an inlet and an outlet;<br>
      <br>
      [0024] b. a second inner shell which is nonporous and which
      substantially encloses the first inner shell;<br>
      <br>
      [0025] c. a first gas plenum located substantially between the
      first and second inner shell, the first plenum having an inlet and
      an outlet, wherein the first plenum outlet is formed by the pores
      of the first inner shell;<br>
      <br>
      [0026] d. an outer shell which is nonporous, at least partially
      transparent, and which substantially encloses the second inner
      shell; and<br>
      <br>
      [0027] e. a second gas plenum located substantially between the
      second inner shell and the outer shell, the second plenum having
      an inlet and an outlet,<br>
      <br>
      [0028] wherein the reactor is heated at least in part by a source
      of concentrated sunlight and the first inner shell is prevented
      from fluid communication with the first and second gas plenums
      inside the reactor, except for fluid communication between the
      first inner shell and the first gas plenum through the pores of
      the first inner shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] FIG. 1 is a cross-section of the central portion of a
      reactor in the present disclosure. In the figures, the same
      numbers are used to identify like features. In the configuration
      shown in FIG. 1, the reactor (1) has a first, innermost, inner
      shell (3) which is at least partially porous, a second inner shell
      (5) which is non-porous, and an outer shell (7) which is at least
      partially transparent to solar radiation and is also non-porous.
      As used herein, "shells" encompass tubes, pipes or chambers which
      are elongated along a longitudinal axis. As used herein, a
      "porous" shell region permits gas flow through the walls of the
      region while a "nonporous" shell region does not. In a reactor
      with three shell, the first inner shell is substantially enclosed
      by the second inner shell and the outer shell and the second inner
      shell is substantially enclosed by the outer shell. As used
      herein, "substantially encloses" means that one shell is enclosed
      by another for most of the length of the shell. The ends of a
      shell that is substantially enclosed by another may extend past
      the ends of the other shell (e.g. the ends of the first inner
      shell may extend past the ends of the second inner shell and/or
      the outer shell). FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment where the
      "shells" are concentric tubes of circular cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] FIG. 1 also illustrates the central portion of the first
      (41) and second (43) gas plenums. During operation of the reactor,
      gases are flowed through the first inner shell and the two gas
      plenums by connecting each of the respective inlets to at least
      one gas source. The porous region(s) of the first inner shell
      serve as an outlet to the first gas plenum. FIG. 1 illustrates
      three gas streams, a first gas stream (21) flowing through the
      first inner shell, a second gas stream (23) flowing through the
      first plenum, and a third gas stream (25) flowing through the
      second plenum. Preferably, the first gas stream is prevented from
      mixing with the third gas stream within the reactor and mixing
      between the first and second streams is limited to mixing within
      the first inner shell due to flow of gas from the second gas
      stream through the porous region(s) of the first inner shell. In
      other words, the first inner shell is preferably prevented from
      fluid communication with the first and second plenum inside the
      reactor, except for fluid communication between the first inner
      shell and the first plenum through the porous region(s) of the
      first inner shell. In addition, during operation of the reactor
      fluid communication between the first inner shell and the first
      plenum is primarily in the direction from the first plenum to the
      first inner shell. The pressure within the first plenum is high
      enough to overcome the resistance of the porous first inner shell
      and still have a pressure (at the instant the gas from the second
      gas stream leaves the pore) greater than the pressure inside the
      shell. Restricting fluid communication between the first inner
      shell and the first and second plenum can prevent deposition of
      particulate reaction products on the other shells and reduce the
      amount of gas from the second and third gas streams which enters
      the first inner shell. The overall volumetric flow rate of gases
      through the first inner shell can affect the residence time and
      the production throughput of the reactor. If the second and third
      gas streams are different, it is also preferred to prevent mixing
      of the second and third gas streams within the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In one embodiment, mixing of the gas streams is restricted
      by seals. If the inner and outer shells are tubes as shown in FIG.
      1, the plenums are further defined by these seals, since they
      serve to define the gas volume. Statement that a plenum is located
      "substantially between" two shells encompasses an extension of the
      plenum beyond the two shells into a sealing structure. In
      addition, a plenum being "substantially located" between two
      shells encompasses reactor configurations where other reactor
      elements, for example thermal insulation, are also located between
      the two shells. FIG. 2 illustrates one sealing configuration which
      can be used to prevent mixing of the gas streams within the
      reactor. In FIG. 2, the inlet and outlets for the inner and outer
      shells are illustrated as part of the sealing structures (31) and
      (33). The inner shell inlet (11) and outlet (12) are substantially
      sealed from the first plenum (41) and second plenum (43). FIG. 2
      also shows the first plenum inlet (13), with the outlet of the
      first plenum being the porous region of the inner shell, and
      second plenum inlet (15) and outlet (16). The sealing structures
      shown in FIG. 2 are cooled with water (34) to prevent heat damage
      to the fitting and sealing materials. Other suitable seal
      configurations are known to those skilled in the art. Furthermore,
      the seal configuration may be different at the inlet and outlet
      ends of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The reactor shown in FIG. 1 is operated generally as
      follows. Concentrated solar-thermal radiation (91) passes through
      the outer "protection" shell (7) and directly heats the second
      inner "heating" shell (5). The nonporous heating shell re-radiates
      from its inner wall and heats the first inner "reaction" shell
      (3). Hence, the inner "reaction" shell (3) is heated indirectly by
      concentrated sunlight from the surrounding "heating" shell (5).
      The inner "reaction" shell (3) re-radiates from the inner wall and
      heats the radiation absorber particles (27) and first gas stream
      (21) flowing through it. When heated, the first gas stream
      undergoes the desired reaction(s). As the first gas stream is
      heated and the desired reaction(s) occur, one or more product
      gases are added to the gas stream. A second gas stream (23) of
      non-oxidizing and non-dissociating "fluid-wall" gas flows in the
      annular region between the central "heating" shell and the inner
      "reaction" shell. The "fluid-wall" gas enters the first plenum
      between the inner and outer shell through an inlet and exits the
      plenum through an outlet. One outlet of the first plenum is the
      porous section of the inner shell. An additional outlet for the
      first plenum may be used, so long as sufficient gas flow is
      provided through the porous section of the inner shell. The
      "fluid-wall" gas flows through the pores of the porous section of
      the "reaction" shell (3), exits radially along the inside of the
      "reaction" shell and provides for an inner "fluid-wall" gas
      blanket (29) that prevents deposition of dissociation product
      particles on the inside wall of the "reaction" shell. After
      entering the first inner shell, the "fluid-wall" gas exits through
      the outlet of the first inner shell. A third gas stream (25) of
      non-oxidizing and non-dissociating "purge" gas flows in the
      annular region between the outer "protection" shell and the center
      "heating" shell, thus preventing oxidation of the central
      "heating" shell and any insulation that may be present between the
      "protection" and "heating" shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In another embodiment, the reactor comprises<br>
      <br>
      [0034] a) an inner shell which is at least partially porous, the
      inner shell having an inlet and an outlet;<br>
      <br>
      [0035] b) an outer shell which is nonporous, at least partially
      transparent, and which substantially encloses the second inner
      shell; and<br>
      <br>
      [0036] c) a gas plenum located substantially between the inner and
      outer shell, the plenum having an inlet and an outlet,<br>
      <br>
      [0037] wherein the reactor is heated at least in part by a source
      of concentrated sunlight and the only fluid communication between
      the inner shell and the gas plenum inside the reactor occurs
      through the pores of the inner shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] This reactor is operated as follows. Concentrated
      solar-thermal radiation passes through the outer "protection"
      shell and directly heats the inner "reaction" shell. The inner
      "reaction" shell re-radiates from the inner wall and heats the
      radiation absorber particles and first gas stream flowing through
      it. When heated, the first gas stream undergoes the desired
      reaction(s). A second gas stream of non-oxidizing and
      non-dissociating "fluid-wall" gas flows in the annular region
      between the outer "protection" shell and the inner "reaction"
      shell. The "fluid-wall" gas enters the plenum between the inner
      and outer shell through an inlet and exits the plenum through an
      outlet. The porous section of the inner shell forms one outlet of
      the plenum. An additional outlet for the plenum may be used, so
      long as sufficient gas flow is provided through the porous section
      of the inner shell. The "fluid wall" gas flows through the pores
      of the porous section of the "reaction" shell, exits radially
      along the inside of the "reaction" shell and provides for an inner
      "fluid-wall" gas blanket that prevents deposition of dissociation
      product particles on the inside wall of the "reaction" shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In general, the shells comprising the reactors of the
      disclosure may be positioned vertically or horizontally, or in any
      other spatial orientation. For the case of a vertical reaction
      shell process, the apparatus may be arranged to provide upward or
      downward flow of the gas stream and the cloud of particles. Upward
      flow guarantees that aggregated particles will not be carried
      through the reaction shell. Downward flow reduces the potential
      for plugging in the solids feed line, if present. Preferably, the
      reactor shell is positioned vertically and flow is downward.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The disclosure provides a method for carrying out a high
      temperature chemical reaction process to produce hydrogen or
      synthesis gas comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      [0041] a) providing a reactor comprising at least two reactor
      shells, including an innermost and an outer shell, wherein the
      innermost shell is substantially enclosed by each of the other
      reactor shells, has an inlet and an outlet and is at least
      partially porous and the outer shell is nonporous and at least
      partially transparent;<br>
      <br>
      [0042] b) flowing a first gas stream comprising at least one
      reactant gas from the inlet to the outlet of the innermost shell;<br>
      <br>
      [0043] c) flowing a second gas stream comprising a
      non-dissociating gas inwardly through the pores of the first inner
      shell;<br>
      <br>
      [0044] d) providing heat absorbing particles in the first gas
      stream;<br>
      <br>
      [0045] e) heating the heat absorbing particles at least in part
      with a source of concentrated sunlight through indirect solar
      thermal heating; and<br>
      <br>
      [0046] f) transferring heat from the particles to the first gas
      stream, thereby heating the reactant gas to a sufficiently high
      temperature so that a desired amount of conversion of the reactant
      gas occurs, thereby producing hydrogen or synthesis gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] For a reactor having a first inner shell, a second inner
      shell, and an outer shell, the disclosure provides a method
      comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      [0048] a) providing a reactor comprising a first inner shell which
      is at least partially porous and has a first inner shell inlet and
      outlet, a second inner shell which is nonporous and substantially
      encloses the first inner shell, an outer shell which is nonporous,
      at least partially transparent and substantially encloses the
      second inner shell, a first plenum substantially located between
      the first inner shell and the second inner shell and having a
      first plenum inlet and outlet, and a second plenum substantially
      located between the second inner shell and the outer shell and
      having a second plenum inlet and outlet wherein the first plenum
      outlet is formed by the pores of the first inner shell and the
      first inner shell is prevented from fluid communication with the
      first and second gas plenums inside the reactor, except for fluid
      communication between the first inner shell and the first gas
      plenum through the pores of the first inner shell;<br>
      <br>
      [0049] b) flowing a first gas stream comprising at least one
      reactant gas from the inlet to the outlet of the first inner
      shell;<br>
      <br>
      [0050] c) flowing a second gas stream comprising a
      non-dissociating gas through the inlet of the first plenum,
      thereby causing part of the second gas stream to flow inwardly
      through the pores of the first inner shell;<br>
      <br>
      [0051] d) flowing a third gas stream comprising a
      non-dissociating, non-oxidizing gas from the inlet to the outlet
      of the second plenum;<br>
      <br>
      [0052] d) providing heat absorbing particles in the first gas
      stream;<br>
      <br>
      [0053] e) heating the heat absorbing particles at least in part
      with a source of concentrated sunlight through indirect solar
      thermal heating; and<br>
      <br>
      [0054] g) transferring heat from the particles to the first gas
      stream, thereby heating the reactant gas to a sufficiently high
      temperature so that a desired amount of conversion of the reactant
      gas occurs, thereby producing hydrogen or synthesis gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The innermost inner shell (the first inner shell in a
      three-shell reactor) has an inlet and an outlet for the first gas
      stream. The interior of the innermost shell defines a reaction
      chamber within which the high temperature reaction takes place.
      The innermost shell is capable of emitting sufficient radiant
      energy to raise the temperature of the reactant gas(es) within the
      reaction chamber to a level required to initiate and sustain the
      desired chemical reaction. The innermost shell is made of a high
      temperature refractory material. The refractory material
      subsequently heats flowing radiation absorber particles flowing
      through the first inner shell and is substantially chemically
      unreactive with the particles or the reactant or product gases. A
      preferred material for the innermost shell is graphite.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The innermost shell is at least partially porous. The
      innermost shell may be wholly of porous material or may comprise
      one or more regions of porous material. For example, the innermost
      shell may take the form of a graphite tube having a central porous
      region with nonporous ends. The porous region(s) of the innermost
      shell are selected so that sufficient uniform flow of
      non-dissociating gas occurs radially inward through the pores to
      provide a fluid-wall protective blanket for the radially inward
      surface of the innermost shell. The fluid-wall can prevent
      particle deposition on the radially inward surface of the
      innermost shell. The porosity of the porous region(s) can be
      varied and is selected on the basis of the required gas flow and
      allowable pressure drop to provide for a fluid-wall of gas to
      prevent deposition along the inside wall of the reactor. The
      length of the porous section(s) of the "reaction" shell can be
      varied and is determined by the zone where particle deposition is
      most likely to occur. Likewise, the placement of the porous
      section along the length of the "reaction" shell is determined by
      the most likely location of particle deposition. Preferably, the
      length of the porous section of the "reaction" shell is limited to
      where it is needed to prevent wall deposition of dissociation
      product particles. Too large of a porous section will provide for
      too much fluid-wall gas entering the interior of the innermost
      "reaction" shell. The entry of fluid-wall gas into the "reaction"
      shell increases the overall volumetric flow rate of gases through
      the "reaction" shell, thus reducing residence time and limiting
      the production throughput of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] A second inner shell substantially enclosing the first
      inner shell may be present, but is not required. If no second
      inner shell is present the "reaction" shell is heated directly by
      concentrated sunlight passing through the "protection" shell and
      "fluid wall" gas is flowed in the plenum substantially located
      between the "reaction" shell and the "protection" shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The use of a second inner shell offers several advantages.
      The use of a nonporous second inner shell distances the "fluid
      wall" gas from the outer "protection" shell, which can increase
      the safety of the process when the "fluid wall" gas is a flammable
      gas such as hydrogen. Furthermore, if the second inner shell is a
      tube made of a material such as graphite, an electrical current
      can be run from one end of the tube to the other and generate
      additional heat for the process through resistance heating of the
      tube. This additional heat can supplement the process at times
      when the source of concentrated sunlight does not provide the
      desired amount of energy (e.g. a cloudy day).<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Typically, the second inner shell is composed of nonporous
      high temperature refractory material. The second inner shell is
      most preferably made of solid graphite. As previously discussed,
      the second inner shell can function as a "heating" shell, since it
      radiates heat to the innermost shell. In addition, the combination
      of the first and the second inner shell at least partially defines
      a first plenum or volume for the non-dissociating fluid wall gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Additional inner shells can be used in the process. If
      used, they are sized and positioned so that the innermost shell is
      enclosed by each of the other reactor shells (i.e. the reactor
      shells are substantially "nested" one inside the other). If
      additional inner shells are used, "purge" gas can be used to
      prevent oxidation of these shells as well.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The outer "protection" shell is at least in part
      transparent or semi-transparent to the concentrated sunlight,
      thereby allowing concentrated sunlight to flow through and heat
      the inner shell(s) of the reactor. The "protection" shell is made
      of a high temperature material that is oxidation resistant. A
      suitable material for the transparent portion of the outer shell
      is quartz. The transparent portion of the outer shell may be a
      transparent section, window or opening to allow the concentrated
      sunlight into the vessel. The shell wall transparent area,
      allowing for concentrated sunlight entry and subsequent solar
      thermal heating, should be selected to provide heating during the
      desired reaction residence time requirements for the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The outer shell may be made entirely of quartz. In this
      case, the sections of the internal wall of the outer shell where
      sunlight is not being concentrated and entering the vessel, may be
      coated with a reflective material, such as silver, to keep the
      concentrated sunlight inside the reactor. If such a reflective
      coating is used, there must be an uncoated transparent section,
      window or opening to allow the concentrated sunlight into the
      vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Alternatively, the outer "protection" shell may be made of
      a refractory non-transparent material with a section containing a
      transparent window where concentrated sunlight can enter, as
      schematically illustrated in FIG. 3. In the configuration shown in
      FIG. 3, both a first (3) and a second inner shell (5) are
      substantially enclosed by the outer shell. The "heating" shell (5)
      is directly exposed to concentrated sunlight in the section of the
      shell located in the path of the sun through the transparent
      section (9) of the "protection" shell (7). As shown in FIG. 3, the
      "heating" shell may be surrounded by refractory insulation (6) in
      the region where it is not directly exposed to concentrated
      sunlight via the transparent section. The insulation may be
      concentrically placed and extends substantially from the "heating"
      shell to the concentric "protection" shell, although it may not
      completely fill the space between the heating shell and the
      protection shell. The refractory insulation can be a combination
      of graphite insulation near the "heating" shell and an alumina
      type refractory insulation near the "protection" shell. This
      design arrangement allows concentrated sunlight to enter through a
      transparent section and heat the "heating" shell while the
      surrounding insulation reduces losses of ultraviolet radiation
      from the "heating" shell, thereby increasing the efficiency of the
      process. It is also possible to provide cooling of the outer metal
      refractory "protection" shell, particularly in the region
      immediately surrounding the transparent window allowing
      concentrated sunlight to directly heat the "heating" shell. The
      non-transparent refractory material may be a metal with a
      sufficiently high melting point, such as steel. In FIG. 3, the
      inlet (11) to the first inner shell is shown as having a feed gas
      inlet (18) and optional heat absorbing particle feed inlet (19).
      The particle feed inlet is not required if the heat absorbing
      particles are wholly generated by the dissociation process.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The combination of the outermost inner shell and the outer
      shell at least partially defines a plenum or volume for gas. If no
      second inner shell is used in the reactor, non-dissociating fluid
      wall gas flows in the space between the outer shell and the inner
      shell. Otherwise, a non-oxidizing and non-dissociating "purge" gas
      typically flows between a second plenum substantially located
      between the outer shell and the second inner shell to protect the
      second inner "heating" shell from oxidation.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The first gas stream initially comprises at least one
      reactant selected from CH4, C2H6, C3H8, generally CxHy, H2S,
      natural gas, or a combination thereof. The first gas stream may
      contain substantial amounts of carbon dioxide, as may be present
      in "biogases" such as landfill gas. Landfill gases may contain as
      much as 40% carbon dioxide. The first gas stream may also
      initially comprise a non-reactive gaseous component. For example,
      in lab-scale tests, methane is sometimes diluted with argon for
      safety reasons. As the gas stream is heated and the reaction or
      reactions occur, one or more product gases are added to the gas
      stream. These product gases comprise H2 and, depending on the
      composition of the reactant gases, may also comprise incomplete
      dissociation products such as C2H2, C2H4, or other gases. In the
      case of reactions (1 to 4), additional carbon particles are also
      produced, and in the case of reaction (5), elemental sulfur is
      produced. A preferred reactant gas stream is natural gas or one
      containing natural gas. A most preferable reactant gas stream is
      natural gas which is free of mercaptans and hydrogen sulfide.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In the method of the disclosure, the first gas stream is
      heated to a sufficiently high temperature within the reactor that
      the desired amount of conversion of the reactant gas(es) is
      obtained. Hydrogen formation may take place below this
      temperature. Preferably the first gas stream is heated to at least
      about 1500 K within the reactor. As used herein, the use of
      "about" with reference to a temperature implies that the
      temperature is within 25 K of the stated temperature. In other
      embodiments, the reactant gas is heated to about 2100 K or heated
      to a maximum temperature in the range between about 1500 K and
      about 2700 K or between about 1800 K and about 2400 K. The
      temperature inside the innermost shell of the reactor can be
      measured with a thermocouple. Alternatively, temperatures inside
      the reactor can be measured with an optical pyrometer. For a
      three-shell reactor, the hot zone temperature measured with an
      optical pyrometer is typically the temperature of the nonporous
      "heating" shell, since the "heating" shell encloses the "reaction"
      shell in the hot zone. The temperature inside the inner "reaction"
      shell may be less than that of the "heating" shell due to thermal
      losses due to heating the porous shell and the gases in the first
      plenum and the reaction shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The reactors and methods of the disclosure allow conversion
      of at least about 30% of a hydrocarbon or hydrogen sulfide
      reactant gas. As used herein, the amount of conversion is the
      ratio of the moles of reactant gas reacted to the moles of
      reactant gas supplied. In various embodiments, the reactors and
      methods of the disclosure can produce at least 50% or at least 70%
      conversion of reactant gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] As used herein, the "residence time" is the time that the
      reactant gas(es) spend in the hot zone of the innermost "reaction"
      shell The hot zone length may be estimated as the length of the
      reactor directly irradiated by the source of concentrated
      sunlight. The residence time depends on the flow rate of the first
      gas stream containing the reactant gas(es), the flow rate of the
      fluid wall gas through the pores of the inner shell, the reactant
      gas temperature and the degree of conversion of the reactant
      gas(es). The residence time may be calculated through modeling or
      estimated by averaging the residence times of the components of
      the gas stream flowing through the innermost tube at reaction
      temperature and assuming that half of the actual conversion occurs
      over the entire length of the hot zone and contributes to the
      formation of additional moles of gas (e.g., 2 moles of hydrogen
      are formed for every mole of methane converted). In the methods of
      the disclosure, the residence time is preferably between about 1
      and about 50 milliseconds. More preferably, the residence time is
      between about 5 and about 30 ms. Most preferably, the residence
      time is between about 10 and about 20 ms.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In the methods of the disclosure, heat absorbing particles
      are provided in the first gas stream. The radiation absorbing
      particles are heated indirectly by solar-thermal heating, and they
      must be easily separated from the gas after processing. Typically,
      these radiation-absorbing particles are carbon black. As used
      herein, "indirect" heating means that the heating is by radiation
      from a heated wall that is itself heated indirectly or directly by
      solar-radiation. In one embodiment, the particles are fine carbon
      black particles. Carbon black is chemically stable at extremely
      high temperatures and can be easily separated from the flowing
      process gas using a filter and/or cyclone separator. Because
      carbon is produced according to hydrocarbon dissociation
      reactions, it is compatible with the hydrocarbon dissociation type
      of reactions to be carried out in the process for producing H2.
      Preferably, the particles comprise recycled carbon black
      synthesized according to the dissociation reactions of the present
      disclosure. More preferably, the particles are carbon black
      particles generated in-situ from the dissociation of a reactant
      gas. In this manner, the carbon black particles can be produced in
      situ via dissociation reactions of gaseous hydrocarbons, thereby
      eliminating the need to feed the particles into the reactor.
      Sulfur particles produced from dissociation of hydrogen sulfide
      are also suitable for use as heat absorbing particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The radiation absorbing particles must be dispersed in the
      reactor apparatus, and the form of dispersion is important. The
      particles should flow as a dust or particle cloud through the
      apparatus, dispersed in a dispersing process gas. The radiation
      absorbing particles should have a fine primary particle size,
      preferably in the sub-micron size range, and be non-agglomerated,
      thus providing the highest surface area possible for solar
      radiation absorption. The heat absorbing particles may be provided
      as a result of the dissociation reaction. For example, carbon
      black particles can be produced in situ via dissociation reactions
      of gaseous hydrocarbons. The particles produced via reactions 1-5
      using the methods of the disclosure typically have a primary
      particle size less than about 50 nm and are essentially amorphous.
      Carbon black particles produced using the methods of the
      disclosure are essentially ash-free and may be more amorphous than
      those produced using other commercially available carbon black
      producing processes. The particles may also be provided by feeding
      the particles into the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] When the particles are provided by feeding preformed
      particles into the reactor, several different methods can be used
      to disperse the particles. The particles can be dispersed
      mechanically, such as by shearing on the surface of a rotating
      drum or brush. Alternatively, the particles can be dispersed using
      the shear provided by high velocity gas exiting with the particles
      from a feed injection tube. Experience has shown that the exiting
      "tip speed" from the injection tube should be at least 10 m/s to
      provide the shear necessary for complete dispersion of fine
      powders. Particles generated in-situ are inherently well dispersed
      in the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The process gas used for dispersing the particles must be
      compatible with the reaction process or easily separated after
      processing. It may be a mixture of recycle gases from the process.
      Preferred dispersing process gases comprise natural gas, CxHy,
      CH4, or H2, or a combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In general, the radiation absorbing particles flow
      co-currently with the flowing gas stream through a reaction shell
      to maximize heat transfer from the particles to the gas. The shell
      may be oriented horizontally or vertically. For the case of a
      vertical reaction shell process, the flow direction may be upward
      or downward. Upward flow guarantees that aggregated particles will
      not be carried through the reaction shell, and downward flow
      reduces the potential for plugging in the solids feed line. A
      preferred flow direction is downward with particles generated
      internally and separated downstream.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The second gas stream used to provide the "fluid-wall"
      blanket gas flowing inward from the porous "reaction" shell wall
      is preferably a non-dissociating gas so as not to plug the pores
      of the porous wall. The fluid-wall gas is also selected to be
      compatible with the reactants and the products, i.e., so that it
      will not interfere with the reaction or be difficult to separate
      from the gas stream exiting the reaction shell. The fluid wall gas
      is preferentially a product of the reaction being carried out.
      Hydrogen (H2) is a preferred fluid wall gas when carrying out
      reactions (1) through (5). The H2 may be recycled from a
      downstream purification process. Inert gases, such as N2 or argon
      are also suitable for use as the second gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In reactors having a first and second inner shell and an
      outer shell, a third gas stream comprising a non-oxidizing and
      non-dissociating "purge" gas flows between the outermost
      "transparent or semi-transparent protection" shell and the solid
      "heating" shell. This "purge" gas can be an hydrogen or an inert
      gas such as N2 or argon.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In the methods of the disclosure, heat absorbing particles
      are heated at least in part with a source of concentrated sunlight
      (91). The reactors may be heated by solar energy alone or by a
      combination of solar energy and resistance heating of one of the
      shells of the reactor. The source of concentrated sunlight (91)
      may be a solar concentrator (50), as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. These
      two figures also show unconcentrated sunlight (90) entering the
      solar concentrator. Preferably, the solar concentrator of the
      apparatus is designed to optimize the amount of solar thermal
      heating for the process. Solar fluxes between about 1500 and about
      2000 kW/m2 have been shown to be sufficient to heat the particles
      to temperatures between 1675 and 1875 K. More preferably, solar
      fluxes between about 2000 and 5000 kW/m2 are desired to achieve
      even higher temperatures and reactor throughputs. Most preferably,
      reaction temperatures are approximately 2100 K.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The sunlight can be provided in the form of a collimated
      beam (spot) source, a concentric annular source distributed
      circumferentially around the reactor, or in the form of a
      linearized slot source providing heating axially along the length
      of reactor. The light can be redirected and focused or defocused
      with various optical components to provide the concentration on or
      in the reactor as required. An example of a suitable solar
      concentrator for use in the present disclosure is the High-Flux
      Solar Furnace (HFSF) at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
      (NREL) in Golden, Colo. The HFSF uses a series of mirrors that
      concentrate sunlight to an intensified focused beam at power
      levels of 10 kW into an approximate diameter of 10 cm. The HFSF is
      described in Lewandowski, Bingham, O'Gallagher, Winston and Sagie,
      "Performance characterization of the SERI Hi-Flux Solar Furnace,"
      Solar Energy Materials 24 (1991), 550 563. The furnace design is
      described starting at page 551, wherein it is stated, The
      performance objectives set for the HFSF resulted in a unique
      design. To enable support of varied research objectives, designers
      made the HFSF capable of achieving extremely high flux
      concentrations in a two-stage configuration and of generating a
      wide range of flux concentrations. A stationary focal point was
      mandatory because of the nature of many anticipated experiments.
      It was also desirable to move the focal point off axis. An
      off-axis system would allow for considerable flexibility in size
      and bulk of experiments and would eliminate blockage and
      consequent reduction in power. In particular, achieving high flux
      concentration in a two-stage configuration (an imaging primary in
      conjunction with a nonimaging secondary concentrator) dictates a
      longer f/D [ratio of focal length to diameter] for the primary
      [concentrator] than for typical single-stage furnaces. Typical
      dish concentrators used in almost all existing solar furnaces are
      about f/D=0.6. To effectively achieve high flux concentration, a
      two-stage system must have an f/D=2. Values higher than this will
      not achieve significantly higher concentration due to increased
      losses in the secondary concentrator. Values lower than this will
      result in a reduction of maximum achievable two-stage flux. At low
      values of f/D, the single stage peak flux can be quite high, but
      the flux profiles are also very peaked and the average flux is
      relatively low. With a longer f/D, two-stage system, the average
      flux can be considerably higher than in any single-stage system.
      The final design of the HFSF has an effective f/D of 1.85. At this
      f/D, it was also possible to move the focal point considerably off
      axis (about 30 degrees) with very little degradation in system
      performance. This was because of the longer f/D and partly because
      of the multi-faceted design of the primary concentrator. This
      off-axis angle allows the focal point and a large area around it
      to be completely removed from the beam between the heliostat and
      the primary concentrator.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] When the outer shell is wholly transparent or has a window
      which extends completely around the shell, the concentrated
      sunlight is preferably distributed circumferentially around the
      reactor using at least one secondary concentrator. Depending upon
      the length of the reaction shell, multiple secondary concentrators
      may be stacked along the entire length of the reaction shell. For
      the HFSF described above, a secondary concentrator that is capable
      of delivering 7.4 kW of the 10 kW available (74% efficiency)
      circumferentially around a 2.54 cm diameter times 9.4 cm long
      reaction tube has been designed, constructed, and interfaced to
      the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] The disclosure also provides reactor systems which combine
      the reactor of the disclosure with one or more other system
      elements. System elements useful for use in the present disclosure
      include, but are not limited to, particle dispersion and feeding
      devices, sources of concentrated solar energy, cooling zones,
      filtering devices, various purification devices, hydrogen storage
      devices, and thermophotovoltaic devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In one embodiment, a cooling zone is located downstream of
      the aerosol transport reactor. The cooling zone is preferably
      expanded and of a larger diameter than the inner "reaction" shell.
      The cooling zone is preferably a jacketed steel tube with a
      coolant flowing within the jacket of the tube. The function of the
      cooling zone is to provide a larger volume where product gases and
      dissociated product particles can be cooled. The purpose of the
      expanded tube is twofold. First, it provides for a reduced
      velocity of product gas and entrained particles flowing through it
      and, hence, an increased residence time for cooling. Second, the
      expanded design allows for dissociated product particles to be
      cooled while flowing in the gaseous space, thus, reducing
      thermophoretic deposition of fine particles on the cooler wall.
      This design reduces the tendency for dissociated product particles
      to deposit along the cooling zone wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Additionally, a system element for removing the solid
      dissociation products from the gas stream can be provided. Carbon
      black particles are preferably removed from the gas stream after
      the gas exits the reaction chamber. The carbon black may be
      removed from the gas stream by suitable methods as known in the
      art, such as by filtration, cyclonic separation, or a combination
      thereof. Some of the carbon black particles may be recycled in the
      process, preferably providing absorber surfaces for heating the
      gas. The carbon black may be sold as a product or may be used as a
      raw material to supply a carbon conversion fuel cell for
      generating electricity. The carbon black from the solar-thermal
      dissociation process is fine sized and preferably substantially
      free of sulfur and ash. Hence, it is a preferred feed stock for
      supplying a carbon conversion fuel cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The system may also comprise a system element for
      separating hydrogen from non-dissociated gaseous components or
      otherwise purifying the hydrogen produced by the process. The
      product gas that is separated from the heat absorbing particles
      can be purified using a pressure swing adsorber (PSA), membrane or
      some other type of gas separation device that will separate
      hydrogen from non-dissociated gaseous reactants (i.e. CH4, CxHy,
      natural gas, etc.) or byproducts of reaction (e.g. acetylene,
      etc). Some of the purified hydrogen can be recycled to the
      process, preferably as the "fluid-wall" gas and "purge gas". Some
      of the recycled hydrogen can be fed to an upstream hydrogenator to
      hydrogenate mercaptans that may have been added to the natural
      gas. The hydrogenated mercaptans are then removed along with H2S
      in a molecular sieve such as an adsorption bed of zinc oxide
      particles. The bulk of the hydrogen will be used in downstream
      processes, preferably to supply fuel cell batteries for stationary
      generation of electricity or for on board transportation
      applications involving fuel cell vehicles. The purified hydrogen
      exiting the separation device (PSA or membrane) may supply a
      hydrogen pipeline at lower pressure or may be compressed and
      stored in a storage tank, such as at a service station for
      servicing fuel cell vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] FIG. 4 illustrates one system comprising a hydrogenation
      and ZnO bed (70), solar-thermal fluid wall reactor (1), a cooling
      zone (60) immediately following the reactor, a baghouse filter
      (62), a low pressure compressor (64), a pressure swing adsorber
      (66), and a high pressure compressor (68). The high pressure
      compressor can additionally be connected to a hydrogen storage
      device, not shown in FIG. 4.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] In another embodiment, a reactor with a transparent outer
      shell such as a quartz tube may be coupled to one or more
      thermophotovoltaic devices. Thermal radiation from the outermost
      inner shell of the reactor (e.g. from a graphite heating tube in a
      three shell reactor) which passes out through the transparent
      outer shell can be used to power the thermophotovoltaic devices.
      The thermophotovoltaic devices are placed in locations not
      shielded by the solar concentrator.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of a Three-Shell Reactor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0087] In accordance with the present disclosure, a concentric
      three-tube aerosol transport reactor was constructed and
      vertically interfaced to the HFSF at NREL. The aerosol transport
      reactor consisted of an outer 5.1 cm outside diameter times 4 mm
      thick times 24 cm long quartz "protection" tube, a central 2.4 cm
      outside diameter times 4 mm thick times 35.6 cm long graphite
      "heating" tube, and a 1.8 cm outside diameter times 6 mm thick
      times 44 cm long graphite "reaction" tube. The "reaction" tube
      consisted of a 30 cm long porous graphite section with 7 cm of
      solid graphite tube on both ends of the "reaction" tube. The
      porosity of the graphite tube was 49% with a permeability of air
      (at standard temperature and pressure (STP)) of 1 ft3/ft2/min. It
      was a sunny day. A secondary concentrator delivered 7.4 kW of
      solar-thermal power over a 9.4 cm length. The concentrator was
      positioned concentrically around the outer quartz "protection"
      tube. A 99% methane/1% argon gas was fed at a rate of 4 standard
      liters per minute (slpm) into the top of the graphite "reaction"
      tube and flowed downward. Hydrogen "fluid-wall" gas was fed at a
      rate of 1 slpm to the annular region between the inner "reaction"
      tube and the central "heating" tube. The hydrogen flowed within
      the annular region and through the porous section of the
      "reaction" tube and exited radially inward providing a fluid-wall
      of hydrogen along the inside "reaction" tube wall. Argon "purge"
      gas flowed at a rate of 2 slpm in the annular region between the
      outer quartz "protection" tube and the central solid graphite
      "heating" tube. The argon prevented oxidation of the graphite
      "heating" tube. No carbon black absorber particles were fed to the
      inner "reaction" tube. The temperature of the reactor as measured
      by a Type B thermocouple inserted in the hot zone was 1873 K. Feed
      gas was flowed for approximately 1 hour. A downstream gas
      chromatograph analyzed the steady state composition of the exiting
      stream, after the 1 slpm "fluid-wall" hydrogen was subtracted out.
      A downstream flowmeter measured the gas flow rate as 3.2 slpm
      (after subtracting out the 1 slpm fluid-wall H2). The unreacted
      methane content was 30 mole % with the remaining gas essentially
      hydrogen. This corresponded to a conversion of 76% of the feed
      methane for a residence time of approximately 0.03 seconds. The
      system was taken off sun and allowed to cool. No dissociated
      carbon was found to be deposited anywhere along the inside wall of
      the "reaction" tube. The product carbon black collected downstream
      was analyzed by x-ray diffraction and found to be essentially
      amorphous carbon black with a primary particle size between
      approximately 20 and 40 nanometers. This example illustrates that
      the fluid-wall reactor tube prevented deposition of reaction
      products within the reactor and allowed continuous operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Operation of a Three-Shell Reactor with No "Fluid-Wall" Gas
        Flow</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0088] The process conditions of Example 1 were repeated except
      that no "fluid-wall" hydrogen gas was flowed through the porous
      "reaction" tube. Within 8 minutes, the process was shut down due
      to difficulties maintaining feed gas flow using mass flow
      controllers. After cooling, the reactor was dismantled and
      inspected. It was found that carbon was deposited inside of the
      "reaction" tube. The carbon was analyzed by x-ray diffraction and
      found to contain a large graphitic content. This comparative
      example illustrates that, without the fluid-wall, the reactor
      plugs and prevents continuous operation.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0089] The apparatus described in Example 1 was used except that
      the "fluid-wall" gas was changed to argon. It was fed at a rate of
      4 slpm through the porous tube wall. In addition, the argon
      "purge" gas flow was increased to 10 slpm.<br>

      </b><b>Reactor Operation with Varying Methane Flow Rate and Solar
        Flux</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0090] The apparatus described in Example 1 was used with the gas
      flow rates given in Example 3. The nonporous "heating" wall
      temperature was measured through a hole in the trough section of
      the secondary concentrator using a pyrometer. For this apparatus,
      the temperature of the wall of the nonporous carbon tube was
      typically about 100-200 K higher than the temperature inside the
      reaction tube. The solar flux was varied in order to achieve
      heating wall temperatures of 1716, 1773, 1923, 2073, and 2140 K.
      Although the "fluid-wall" argon flow rate was maintained at 4
      slpm, the methane flow rate was varied from 0.8 to 2.2 slpm. All
      flow rates corresponded to average residence times between
      approximately 10 and 20 milliseconds. The dissociation
      (conversion) of methane to hydrogen and carbon black was
      calculated from the measured concentration of H2 and is reported
      in Table 1.<br>

      [0091] This set of examples indicates that increasing the solar
      flux, which in turn increases the heating wall temperature and the
      temperature inside the reactor tube, results in an increase in the
      thermal dissociation (conversion) of methane to H2 and carbon
      black. The product carbon black for all runs was analyzed by x-ray
      diffraction and transmission electron microscope images to
      determine that it was amorphous carbon black with a primary
      particle size of 20 to 40 nanometers.<br>

      [0092] The apparatus described in Example 1 was used. During these
      experiments, the argon "purge gas" was fed at a rate of 10 slpm.
      The "fluid-wall" argon was fed at a rate of 4 slpm. The reactant
      gas was maintained at a two to one CH4 to CO2 feed ratio. Total
      flow rates of 1 and 2 slpm were used. By changing the solar flux,
      the heating wall temperature was varied from 1873 to 2123 K, with
      increments of 50 K. The conversion of methane was calculated from
      the measured concentration of H2, and the conversion of CO2 was
      calculated from the measured concentration of CO. Both values are

      sunlight can be used to carry out dry CO2 reforming of CH4
      reactions in short residence times. It is also evident that both
      increased temperature and decreased reactant gas flow rate result
      in higher conversion of CO2 to CO and CH4 to H2.<br>

      [0095] This set of experiments shows that the fluid-wall aerosol
      flow reactor can be used to carry out dry CO2 reforming of CH4
      reactions with various reactant feed ratios. It also indicates
      that for a given total flow rate, changing the feed ratio does not
      significantly change the conversion of CH4 to H2 or the conversion
      of CO2 to CO. However, both conversion values are increased when
      the total flow rate of CH4 and CO2 is decreased from 2 slpm to 1
      slpm.<br>
      <br>
      [0000] Additional points include<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The present disclosure provides a method for carrying out
      high temperature thermal dissociation reactions requiring
      rapid-heating and short residence times using solar energy. In
      particular, the present disclosure provides a method for carrying
      out high temperature thermal reactions such as dissociation of
      hydrocarbon containing gases and hydrogen sulfide to produce
      hydrogen and dry reforming of hydrocarbon containing gases with
      carbon dioxide. In the methods of the disclosure where hydrocarbon
      containing gases are dissociated, fine carbon black particles are
      also produced. The methods of the disclosure reduce or prevent the
      produced carbon black from depositing along the inside wall of the
      reactor or cooling zone. The present disclosure also provides
      solar-thermal aerosol transport reactors and solar-thermal reactor
      systems. The present disclosure also provides systems and methods
      for separating the produced carbon black from the product gases,
      purifying the hydrogen produced by the dissociation reaction, and
      using the carbon black and hydrogen to generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] There is an enormous environmental benefit for carrying out
      high temperature dissociation reactions directly without the
      combustion of carbonaceous fuels. Thus, the present disclosure
      provides a continuous cost-effective, solar-based method of
      deriving hydrogen and fine carbon black particles from hydrocarbon
      gases. The process does not result in increased environmental
      damage due to burning fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The process of the present disclosure uses concentrated
      sunlight to transfer heat at extremely high rates by radiation
      heat transfer to inert radiation absorbing particles flowing in
      dilute phase in the process gas. The heating to the particles is
      generally carried out indirectly from a heated wall or series of
      walls which are themselves heated indirectly or heated directly by
      solar-thermal radiative heating. The inside most wall ("reaction")
      is at least partially fabricated of a porous refractory material
      with a compatible "fluid-wall" gas flowing inward, thus, providing
      a blanket of gas and preventing deposition of particles on the
      inside wall. The particles subsequently become radiators
      themselves and heat flowing gases by conduction, thereby providing
      the energy to carry out highly endothermic gas phase dissociation
      reactions. The radiative coupling to heat flowing radiation
      absorbing particles is beneficial because the gases to be heated
      are themselves transparent to radiative heating. Preferably, the
      gases and the particles flow co-currently to maximize the
      temperature and heating rate of the gases. It is possible for the
      absorber particles to either be fed into the process with the
      reactant gas or to be generated in-situ by the reaction itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In an embodiment, a method for carrying out a high
      temperature chemical reaction process to produce hydrogen or
      synthesis gas may include at least the following the steps: a)
      providing a reactor comprising at least two reactor shells,
      including an innermost and an outer shell, wherein the innermost
      shell is substantially enclosed by each of the other reactor
      shells, has an inlet and an outlet and is at least partially
      porous and the outer shell is nonporous and at least partially
      transparent; b) flowing a first gas stream comprising at least one
      reactant gas from the inlet to the outlet of the innermost shell;
      c) flowing a second gas stream comprising a non-dissociating gas
      inwardly through the pores of the innermost shell; d) providing
      heat absorbing particles in the first gas stream; e) heating the
      heat absorbing particles at least in part with a source of
      concentrated sunlight through indirect solar thermal heating; and
      f) transferring heat from the particles to the first gas stream,
      thereby heating the reactant gas to a sufficiently high
      temperature so that a desired amount of conversion of the reactant
      gas occurs, thereby producing hydrogen or synthesis gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The reactant gas may be a gaseous hydrocarbon, hydrogen
      sulfide or a mixture thereof. For example, the gaseous hydrocarbon
      is methane, ethane, propane, butane, or a mixture thereof.
      Alternatively, the reactant gas maybe at least one gaseous carbon
      oxide including carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, or mixtures
      thereof. The volume concentration of carbon dioxide in the
      reactant gas can be less than 50 volume percent. The heat
      absorbing particles can be carbon particles, and the carbon
      particles are fed into the innermost shell with the first gas
      stream. The temperature of the reactor is at least about 1500 K.
      The source of concentrated sunlight can have a flux of between
      1500 and 5000 kW/m2.<br>

      <b>FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] In general, the disclosure relates to solar-thermal
      reactors and processes for carrying out high temperature chemical
      reactions. More particularly in an embodiment, it relates to a
      rapid-heating, short residence time solar-thermal process for
      carrying out highly endothermic dissociation reactions to produce
      hydrogen or hydrogen containing gases. Most particularly, in an
      embodiment it relates to those dissociation reactions wherein a
      solid particulate material is produced by the dissociation of a
      gaseous precursor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] There is a significant interest to develop benign processes
      for producing hydrogen that can be used as a fuel to power fuel
      cell vehicles. Such processes should reduce the amount of
      greenhouse gases produced, thus, minimizing impact on the
      environment. However, current methods for producing hydrogen incur
      a large environmental liability, because fossil fuels are burned
      to supply the energy to reform natural gas (primarily methane,
      CH4) to produce hydrogen (H2).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] High temperatures above approximately 1500 K are required
      for producing hydrogen and carbon black at high rates by the
      direct thermal dissociation of methane [CH4+heat--&gt;C+2H2]
      (reaction 1), ethane [C2H6+heat-&gt;2C+3H2] (reaction 2), propane
      [C3H8+heat--&gt;3C+4H2] (reaction 3), or, in general, a mixture of
      gases such as natural gas generically represented as CxHy
      [CxHy+heat--&gt;xC+(y/2)H2] (reaction 4).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Hydrogen can also be produced by the dry reforming of
      methane with carbon dioxide [CH4+CO2--&gt;2CO+2 H2]. It is also
      possible to carry out dissociation of methane simultaneously with
      the dry reforming of methane if excess methane is present relative
      to that required to react carbon dioxide. Such processes are
      useful since they can provide for a high hydrogen content
      synthesis gas by utilizing natural gas from natural gas wells that
      contain a high concentration of carbon dioxide (typically 10 to 20
      volume % CO2) or using landfill biogas (30 to 40 volume % CO2).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Hydrogen can also be produced by the thermal dissociation
      of hydrogen sulfide [H2S+heat--&gt;H2+S] (reaction 5).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] For these types of dissociation reactions, a solid (either
      C or S) is formed as a co-product (with H2) of the reaction.
      Often, the solid that is formed is in the state of fine particles.
      These particles have a tendency to deposit along the walls of
      reaction vessels or cooling chambers where the dissociation is
      occurring. If deposition occurs along the inside walls of the
      heated reactor, the particles tend to aggregate and crystallize.
      For the case of carbon deposition, the normally amorphous
      ultra-fine particles will grow in size and graphitize. Large
      graphitic carbon particles are less reactive compared to more
      amorphous fine sized particles and, hence, are of lower value.
      Furthermore, deposition on the reactor walls can cause plugging of
      the reactor and eventual shutdown of the process, thus, preventing
      continuous operation. In addition, carbon deposition on an outer
      transparent wall of a solar reactor can lead to overheating of the
      reactor wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] U.S. Pat. No. 4,552,741, to Buck et al., reports carbon
      dioxide reforming of methane in a system comprising two catalytic
      reactors. One of the catalytic reactors is heatable with solar
      energy. In the abstract, the reactors are stated to be "filled
      with a catalyst".<br>
      <br>
      [0010] U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,877 reports solar energy gasification
      of solid carbonaceous material in a liquid dispersion. The solid
      carbonaceous material is heated by solar energy and transfers heat
      to a surrounding liquid. Hydrogen is produced in the process by
      the decomposition/gasification of the hydrocarbon (coal)
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] EP 0675075A reports the use of solar energy to generate
      hydrogen from water. In the reported process, water is reduced to
      hydrogen with a metal, followed by reduction of the metal oxide
      with a reducing agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Hence, there is a need to develop high temperature
      environmentally benign processes for the production of H2 by
      thermal dissociation of hydrocarbon gases, such as natural gas,
      and to prevent the deposition of the products of dissociation on
      reactor walls.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0013] Various methods and apparatus are described for a high
      temperature chemical reactor. In an embodiment, a high temperature
      chemical reactor conducts a reaction process to that produces
      hydrogen or synthesis gas. The reactor may have at least two
      reactor shells, including an inner shell and an outer shell. The
      inner shell has an inlet and an outlet and the outer shell is
      nonporous and substantially encloses the second inner shell. A
      particle inlet provides heat absorbing particles in a first gas
      stream flowing in the inner shell. The reactor is heated at least
      in part by a source of concentrated sunlight. The inner shell is
      heated by the concentrated sunlight, and the inner shell
      re-radiates from the inner wall and heats the heat absorbing
      particles in the first gas stream flowing through the inner shell,
      and heat transfers from the heat absorbing particles to the first
      gas stream. The heat absorbing particles heats the reactants in
      the first gas stream to a sufficiently high temperature so that
      the first gas stream undergoes the desired reaction(s), thereby
      producing hydrogen or synthesis gas in the first gas stream.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] This invention is in the field of solar biomass
      gasification and pyrolysis<br>
      <br>
      [0004] As processes, biomass gasification and pyrolysis have been
      known for a long time. Several different types of reactors have
      been used to gasify and/or pyrolize biomass including fixed bed
      reactors, fluidized bed reactors, and entrained flow reactors. A
      variety of sources of heat for biomass gasification and pyrolysis
      processes have been used, including fossil fuels (Ni, et al, Fuel
      Processing Technology, 2006, pp. 461-472) and combustion of
      biomass or biomass reaction products such as pyrolysis oil (e.g.
      U.S. Pat. No. 4,497,637 to Purdy et al).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Solar gasification of carbonaceous particles has also been
      reported in the patent literature. U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,877 to
      Epstein reports solar energy gasification of solid carbonaceous
      material in a liquid dispersion. An aqueous dispersion of
      carbonaceous material is introduced into the reactor so as to form
      water droplets enclosing particulates of the carbonaceous
      material. The solid carbonaceous material is heated by solar
      energy and transfers heat to a surrounding liquid. Hydrogen is
      produced in the process by the decomposition/gasification of the
      hydrocarbon (coal) particles. A variety of carbonaceous materials
      are mentioned as possible feedstocks including coal and various
      biomasses.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] U.S. Pat. No. 4,290,779 to Frosch et al. reports a solar
      heated fluidized bed gasification system for gasifying
      carbonaceous material. Solar radiation is introduced into a
      refractory honeycomb shell which surrounds the fluidized bed
      reactor. Both coal and organic biomass materials are mentioned as
      possible powdered carbonaceous feedstocks.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 4,229,184 to Gregg reports an apparatus for
      using focused solar radiation to gasify coal and other
      carbonaceous materials. The solar radiation is directed down
      through a window onto the surface of a vertically moving bed of
      the carbonaceous material.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It has been shown that solar thermal reactors can achieve
      temperatures up to 2500 K (2227[deg.] C.). Temperatures even
      higher than this are achievable, but in those regimes materials
      and reradiation loss issues become major concerns. Solar thermal
      systems have been applied to the dissociation of methane (Dahl, et
      al., International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 29, 2004) or ZnO
      (Perkins, et al., International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 29,
      2004; Steinfeld, Solar Energy, 78, 2005). Carbon has been used as
      reducing agents for ZnO (Müller, R, P Haeberling, and R Palumbo,
      "Further advances toward the development of a direct heating solar
      thermal chemical reactor for the thermal dissociation of ZnO(s),"
      Solar Energy, 80, 2005, pp. 500-511).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] The invention provides processes that perform biomass
      gasification or pyrolysis for production of hydrogen, synthesis
      gas, liquid fuels, or other hydrocarbon based chemicals. The
      methods of the invention use solar thermal energy as the energy
      source for the biomass pyrolysis or gasification. This allows
      operation at temperatures above 950[deg.] C., speeding up reaction
      kinetics and shifting thermodynamics to various reaction end
      products, thus, bypassing the formation of tars and other liquids
      that have a tendency to cause plugging or increased pressure drop
      in gas/solid filtration devices downstream of the reactor and
      which are undesired side products. The increase in reaction rate,
      the use of a renewable energy resource, the avoidance of tars, and
      the wider range of available thermodynamic regimes give great
      advantage to one who would utilize solar thermal energy. Usage of
      solar thermal energy can reduce the overall amount of biomass
      required to produce the product chemicals, allows for a greater
      range of product control, does not rely on fossil fuel usage, and
      takes advantage of a freely available resource (solar energy).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In the methods of the invention, an entrainment flow
      solar-thermal reactor is used to carry out the high temperature
      thermal dissociation reactions, thereby permitting rapid-heating
      of the biomass particles and short residence times of the
      particles in the reactor. Rapid heating is of great advantage for
      this solar chemistry. Rapidly heating to high temperature
      (&gt;950[deg.] C.) prevents the biomass particles from spending
      significant portions of time in temperature regimes (200[deg.]
      C.-800[deg.] C.) where formation of liquid side products and tars
      is favorable. The selectivity of the reactor toward desired
      products is thus increased. Likewise, rapid heating allows the
      particles to spend the most time possible in the temperature
      regimes where reaction rates are fastest (950[deg.] C. to
      1400[deg.] C.). A rapid reaction allows the thermal energy
      imparted to the particles to be converted to chemical energy more
      quickly, reducing the portion of incident energy lost to
      re-radiation or conduction and increasing reactor efficiency.
      Additionally, a more rapid reaction leads to shorter effective
      residence times and higher reactor throughput; essentially, the
      production rates of fuels can be increased while leaving the area
      of solar concentrators constant. In different embodiments, the
      residence time is less than or equal to 5 seconds or less than or
      equal to 3 seconds. In an embodiment, the heating rate of the
      particles is greater than 100[deg.] C./s; preferably, this heating
      rate is greater than 1000[deg.] C./s.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present invention also provides a method for carrying
      out a closed thermochemical/photosynthetic cycle for splitting
      water to produce hydrogen. A biomass feedstock such as algae can
      be grown in a controlled atmosphere greenhouse environment with
      algae receiving direct sunlight and being fed water and carbon
      dioxide and releasing oxygen to the environment via
      photosynthesis. The algae can be cultivated and fed as a biomass
      reactant to the reactor described herein. The algae can be
      pyrolyzed by high temperature solar thermal heating as described
      herein. The resulting "syngas" of carbon monoxide and hydrogen can
      be fed to a conventional "water-gas shift reactor" where water is
      fed and hydrogen and carbon dioxide are produced via a controlled
      catalytic process (CO+H2O-H2+CO2). The exiting gas is primarily H2
      and CO2 which can be separated by conventional membrane or
      pressure swing adsorption processing. The H2 can be used as a
      reactant or a fuel while the CO2 is fed to the algae in the
      greenhouse. Water is effectively split to H2 and O2 via a combined
      solar thermochemical/photosynthetic process in two separate steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The present invention also provides processes which involve
      reduction of metal oxide particles with biomass pyrolysis products
      in a solar-thermal reactor. The invention also provides
      "renewable" hydrogen producing processes in which the hydrogen
      produced from reaction of the reduced metal oxide products with
      water is combined with hydrogen produced by reaction of gaseous
      products of the solar thermal reactor in a water-gas shift
      reactor, both processes being as described in Example 6 and
      elsewhere in this application. The invention also provides
      processes in which hydrogen produced by the methods of the
      invention are combined with conventional fossil feeds. For
      example, hydrogen can be combined with coal to produce methane as
      described in Example 7. Such a process represents a transitional
      bridge to a truly hydrogen economy.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0027] In the processes of the invention, a solid or liquid
      biomass feed is pyrolyzed or gasified in a solar thermal reactor
      system at elevated temperatures. In different embodiments of the
      pyrolyzation processes of the invention, no significant source of
      oxygen or water is supplied during the process. An oxidizing agent
      is conventionally present in gasification processes. In the
      gasification processes of the invention, water (generally in the
      form of steam) is supplied and contacted with the biomass
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In an embodiment, the biomass feed is in the form of solid
      particles. The biomass feed particles or droplets are entrained in
      a gas as they move through the reactor. In an embodiment, metal
      oxide particles are fed into the reactor concurrently with biomass
      particles. In another embodiment particles of a fossil fuel such
      as coal are fed into the reactor concurrently with biomass
      particles. In an embodiment, no additional catalyst is added to
      the biomass feed.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The necessary endothermic heat of reaction and sensible
      heat is supplied by a solar-thermal energy system. The biomass
      particles or droplets may be directly heated by solar radiation,
      in which case the reactor is configured to transmit solar
      radiation to the particles. In another embodiment, the biomass
      particles or droplets are indirectly heated. As used herein,
      "indirect" heating means that the heating is by radiation from a
      heated wall that is itself heated indirectly or directly by solar
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In an embodiment, the pyrolysis and gasification processes
      of the invention produce hydrogen and carbon monoxide (synthesis
      gas or syngas). Other products such as carbon dioxide, carbon,
      methane and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons may also be
      produced in the process. In different embodiments, the conversion
      of the non-ash components of the biomass is greater 30%, greater
      than or equal to 40%, greater than 50%, greater than or equal to
      60%, greater than or equal to 70%, greater than or equal to 75%
      greater than 80%, greater than 90% or greater than 95%. This
      extent of conversion may be achieved in a single pass. In
      different embodiments, the conversion of carbon to carbon monoxide
      is greater than 30%, greater than 40%, greater than 50%, greater
      than 60%, greater than 70%, greater than 80%, greater than 90% or
      greater than 95%. In different embodiments, the molar ratio of
      carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide is less than 25% or less than
      10%. In different embodiments, the molar ratio of hydrogen (H2) to
      carbon monoxide is 1:1, greater than 1:1 and less than 2:1; less
      than 2:1; greater than 2:1 and less than 3:1; or greater than 3:1.
      The ratio of hydrogen to carbon monoxide may be adjusted by
      adjusting the amount of water added to the feed.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The products of the biomass pyrolyzation or gasification
      process can be combined in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor to produce
      liquid hydrocarbon products, or can be reacted further with water
      in a Water-Gas Shift reaction to maximize hydrogen yield. Such a
      process makes use of renewable, biologically derived feedstocks
      and is, in a worst case, carbon and greenhouse gas neutral.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As stated above, the invention provides a chemical process
      in which carbon containing biomass feedstocks (for example, but
      not limited to, cellulose, hemi-cellulose, lignin, xylose, other
      plant sugars, algae, agricultural, industrial, brewery, or
      forestry residues) are either pyrolized or combined with water at
      high temperature (&gt;950[deg.] C.). In different embodiments, the
      biomass feedstock may be a tall prairie grass, such as switchgrass
      and/or miscanthus, algae, pressed algal residue from a biodiesal
      processing facility, spent grain from a brewery, wood chips, or
      sawdust. In an embodiment, feedstocks for use with the invention
      do not include mixtures of coal and biomass. In another embodiment
      particles of a fossil fuel such as coal are fed into the reactor
      concurrently with biomass particles. In one aspect of the
      invention, the biomass feedstock is selected to have an ash
      content less than about 15%, less than about 10% or less than
      about 5%.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In different embodiments, the maximum particle size of the
      biomass feedstock is less than 10 mm, less than 5 mm, less than 1
      mm, less than 500 microns, less than 200 microns, less than 100
      microns, less than 50 microns, or less than 20 microns. In an
      embodiment, the minimum "average" size of the biomass feedstock is
      10 microns, as identified by the volume average equivalent
      spherical particle diameter or as the volume average of the
      longest particle dimension (if the particles are long and flat,
      like blades of grass). There may be smaller particles in the
      system (e.g. submicron), but on a mass basis these particles will
      be a very small fraction (in an embodiment &lt;5 vol %) of the
      total.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The reactor product composition can be thermodynamically
      and kinetically controlled by reactor temperature, pressure,
      residence time, water concentration, feedstock concentration, and
      inert gas concentration, in addition to reactor design, solar
      energy concentration, and other factors not mentioned here. In
      different embodiments, the temperature in the hot zone of the
      reactor is between 750[deg.] C. and 1500[deg.] C., between
      950[deg.] C. and 1400[deg.] C., or between 1100[deg.] C. and
      1350[deg.] C., where the temperature is the average temperature of
      the particles in the reaction hot zone. The necessary energy to
      attain such temperatures and achieve the reaction is, in all
      cases, derived from a system which converts solar radiation into
      thermal energy ("solar-thermal").<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In an embodiment, the reactor operates at atmospheric
      pressure. In another embodiment, the reactor can be run at
      pressures above atmospheric pressure, but this will drive the
      thermodynamics toward the liquid products and the reactants. In
      this embodiment, the compressors can be removed from the
      downstream side of the reactor and replaced with water pumps.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] During the biomass gasification processes of the invention,
      the water concentration provides at least a one to one molar ratio
      of steam to biomass feed. In an embodiment, the water
      concentration may be increased slightly to compensate for a
      relatively high carbon to oxygen atomic ratio in the feedstock.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In an embodiment, the invention provides a method for at
      least partially converting biomass particles to hydrogen and
      carbon monoxide, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      [0038] a) providing a solar-thermal reactor comprising an outer
      protection shell and an inner reaction shell having an inlet and
      an outlet, the outer protection shell being at least partially
      transparent or having an opening to the atmosphere for
      transmission of solar energy,<br>
      <br>
      [0039] b) flowing a gas stream comprising entrained biomass
      particles from the inlet to the outlet of the reaction shell; and<br>
      <br>
      [0040] c) heating the biomass particles in the reactor at least in
      part with a source of concentrated sunlight through solar thermal
      heating to a temperature at which the biomass particles react to
      form products comprising hydrogen and carbon monoxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The invention also provides methods for at least partially
      converting the biomass particles to other products in addition to
      hydrogen and carbon monoxide. These other products include, but
      are not limited to, carbon and carbon dioxide. In an embodiment,
      the biomass particles are at least partially converted to carbon,
      hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. In another
      embodiment, the biomass particles are at least partially converted
      to hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. In other
      embodiment the reaction products can include higher molecular
      weight hydrocarbons (e.g. CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, C3s, C4s, etc),
      or hydrocarbons with oxygen bearing functional groups (e.g.
      alcohols, aldehydes).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 1 is a schematic top view of a horizontal
      cross-section of a solar reactor having an outer "protection
      shell" and a nonporous inner "reaction" shell. The solar reactor
      shown in FIG. 1 is operated generally as follows. Concentrated
      solar-thermal radiation (91) passes through an opening in the
      outer "protection" shell (7) and directly heats the inner
      "reaction" shell (3). In FIG. 1, the outer shell (7) is shown as
      having an opening (8) to the atmosphere, but in an alternative
      embodiment the outer shell contains a window which transmits solar
      radiation. In an embodiment, the inner surface of the outer shell
      may reflect solar radiation (in particular radiation in the
      visible range) and infrared radiation. In another embodiment, the
      inner surface is capable of absorbing and re-emitting radiation.
      The entrainment gas and the feedstock flow through the bore of the
      reaction shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In an embodiment, the inner "reaction" shell is at least
      partially transparent to solar radiation, in which case the
      biomass particles are directly heated by the solar-thermal
      radiation. In an embodiment, the inner shell is at least partially
      transparent to solar radiation in the wavelength range 200 nm to
      20 microns. When heated, the biomass particles undergo the desired
      reaction(s).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In another embodiment, the inner "reaction" shell is
      nonporous and does not transmit solar radiation. In an embodiment,
      the inner shell does not transmit solar radiation in the
      wavelength range 200 nm to 20 microns. In this case, the nonporous
      reaction shell is directly heated to temperatures above the
      reaction temperature and re-radiates from its inner wall to heat
      the biomass particles and entraining gas stream flowing through
      it. The biomass particles are thus indirectly heated. When heated,
      the biomass particles undergo the desired reaction(s).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The reactor may also have a plurality of non-concentric
      reaction shells substantially enclosed by the outer shell, as
      illustrated in FIGS. 2a and 2b. FIGS. 2a and 2b are also schematic
      top views of horizontal cross-sections of the reactor. FIG. 2a
      illustrates a configuration in which the inner tubes (3) are
      arranged along an arc within the outer tube (7). FIG. 2b
      illustrates an embodiment in which the inner tubes (3) are
      arranged in a staggered configuration within the outer tube (7).
      The tube arrangement is not limited to these two spatial
      configurations, as explained in more detail below. The specific
      arrangement can be selected to maximize efficiency. In one
      embodiment, the tubes are arranged in a staggered pattern. In
      another embodiment, the centers of the tubes are aligned along a
      semicircle. In an embodiment, the number of inner reaction shells
      is from 3 to 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] A non-oxidizing and non-dissociating "purge" gas may be
      flowed in a second plenum substantially located between the outer
      shell and the inner shells to protect the inner shells from
      oxidation, depending on the material(s) of the inner shells. In
      this case, the protection shell does not have an opening to the
      atmosphere. The purge gas may be argon, helium, neon, nitrogen, or
      any other chemically inert gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In another embodiment, the reaction shell is at least
      partially porous, to allow a "fluid wall" to be formed at the
      inner surface of the reaction shell. A "fluid wall" gas is flowed
      radically inward into the reaction shell through the porous
      section of the shell, thus providing a blanket of gas. The "fluid
      wall" can prevent deposition of particles on the inside wall and
      protect the inside wall from the reaction products. As used
      herein, a "porous" shell region permits gas flow through the walls
      of the region while a "nonporous" shell region does not. In one
      embodiment, a gas stream of "fluid-wall" gas flows in the annular
      region between the outer "protection" shell and the inner
      "reaction" shell. The "fluid-wall" gas enters the plenum between
      the inner and outer shell through an inlet and exits the plenum
      through an outlet. The porous section of the inner shell forms one
      outlet of the plenum. An additional outlet for the plenum may be
      used, so long as sufficient gas flow is provided through the
      porous section of the inner shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In another embodiment, an additional nonporous inner shell
      which substantially encloses the porous reaction shell can be
      provided. The "fluid wall" gas is supplied to the porous section
      of the reaction shell by flowing it through the annular space
      between the two inner shells; this annular space forms a plenum.
      The "fluid-wall" gas enters the plenum through an inlet and exits
      the plenum through an outlet. One outlet of the first plenum is
      the porous section of the inner shell. As used herein,
      "substantially encloses" means that one shell is enclosed by
      another for most of the length of the shell. The ends of a shell
      that is substantially enclosed by another may extend past the ends
      of the other shell (e.g. the ends of the first inner shell may
      extend past the ends of the second inner shell and/or the outer
      shell). In an embodiment, the solar thermal reactor is a
      solar-thermal fluid-wall reactor as described in United States
      Patent Application Publication US 2003/0182861 to Weimer et al.,
      which is hereby incorporated by reference to the extent not
      inconsistent with the disclosure herein. United States Patent
      Application Publication 20030208959 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,872,378 to
      Weimer et al. are also hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] A reactor having two concentric inner shells (a first
      innermost "reaction" shell and a second inner "heating shell") is
      operated generally as follows. Concentrated solar-thermal
      radiation passes through the outer "protection" shell and directly
      heats the second inner "heating" shell. The nonporous heating
      shell re-radiates from its inner wall and heats the first inner
      "reaction" shell. Hence, the inner "reaction" shell is heated
      indirectly by concentrated sunlight from the surrounding "heating"
      shell. The inner "reaction" shell re-radiates from the inner wall
      and heats the biomass particles and gas stream flowing through it.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for
      reduction of metal oxide particles comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      a) providing a solar-thermal reactor comprising an outer
      protection shell and an inner reaction shell having an inlet and
      an outlet, the outer protection shell being either at least
      partially transparent or having an opening to the atmosphere for
      transmission of solar energy;<br>
      b) flowing a gas stream comprising entrained biomass and metal
      oxide particles from the inlet to the outlet of the reaction
      shell, wherein the biomass and gas stream do not comprise
      substantial amounts of water;<br>
      c) heating the biomass and metal oxide particles in the reactor at
      least in part with a source of concentrated sunlight through solar
      thermal heating to a temperature at which the biomass particles
      paralyze to form reaction products comprising hydrogen, carbon,
      and carbon monoxide and the metal oxide particles react with at
      least one of the biomass paralysis reaction products to form a
      reduced metal oxide product which is a metal, a metal oxide of a
      lower valence state, or a combination thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In an embodiment, of the metal oxide reduction process,
      concentrated solar-thermal radiation passes through the outer
      "protection" shell and directly heats the inner "reaction" shell.
      The inner "reaction" shell conducts heat and re-radiates from the
      inner wall and heats the biomass and metal oxide particles and gas
      stream flowing through it. Other reactor designs described
      elsewhere in this application can also be used. When heated, the
      biomass particles undergo a paralysis reaction. Products of the
      paralysis reaction include hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon
      dioxide, and carbon. At elevated temperatures, metal oxide
      particles can react with hydrogen, carbon monoxide or carbon to
      form a reduced metal oxide product. Depending on the reactor
      temperature, the metal oxide particles may react with more than
      one of the biomass paralysis reaction products. For example, at
      temperatures above about 1475 K, both C and CO are expected to
      reduce Zone. The primary products exiting the solar thermal
      reactor are the reduced metal oxide product, H2, CO and CO2.
      Depending on the temperature distribution within the reactor, the
      reduced metal oxide product may be present in the reactor in
      gaseous, liquid, or solid forms, or in combinations thereof. If
      the reduced metal oxide product is present in gaseous form, a
      cooling device may be connected to the outlet of the reactor to
      nucleate reduced metal oxide particles (the reduced metal oxide
      particles can be metal particles) of the desired size. Cooling
      devices compatible with solar thermal reactors as described in
      United States Patent Application No. US 2006-0188433 to Weimer et
      al., hereby incorporated by reference to the extent not
      inconsistent with the disclosure herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Metal oxides suitable for use with the invention are
      compounds consisting essentially of one or more metals and oxygen,
      the compounds being solid at room temperature. In an embodiment,
      the impurity level is less than or equal to 1%. In an embodiment,
      the metal oxide is ZnO. In another embodiment, the metal oxide is
      SnO2. Metal oxides suitable for use with the invention include
      mixed metal oxides which include more than one metal, such as
      mixed metal ferrites. As used herein, mixed metal ferrites are
      compounds of iron oxide with oxides of other transition metals.
      For example, included would be iron oxides with Ni (II), Co (II),
      or Man (II) inclusions, such as MnFexO4, NiFexO4, Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4
      and Co0.5Mn0.5Fe2O4. High temperature dissociation of such oxides
      can produce an activated, oxygen deficient form, such as
      Ni0.5Mn0.5Fe2O(4-delta). This activated form could be combined
      with water at relatively low temperatures to yield hydrogen and
      the original mixed metal oxide. Ferrites useful in the present
      invention have decomposition temperatures substantially below that
      of iron oxide. In different embodiments, the particle size of the
      metal oxide is below 150 microns, or below 100 microns;<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The reduced metal oxide product is selected from the group
      consisting of a metal, a metal oxide and combinations thereof.
      These combinations can include combinations of metal oxides. For
      example, Fe2O3 may reduce partially to Fe3O4, partially to FeO,
      and partially to Fe.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In different embodiments, the conversion of the metal oxide
      to a reduced metal or to a lower oxidation state metal oxide is at
      least 50%, at least 75%, or at least 90%.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The present invention also provides processes for the
      production of hydrogen from the reaction of reduced metal oxide
      products with water. One step in the processes is the reduction of
      metal oxide particles with biomass pyrolysis products in a high
      temperature solar thermal reactor as described above. The products
      of the metal oxide reduction reaction can then be used to react
      with water in a succeeding step, generating hydrogen and the
      original metal oxide. Reaction and separation steps following the
      metal oxide reduction step may be performed "off-sun", allowing
      continuous production of hydrogen from stored reduced metal oxide
      product. The "off-sun" step is typically exothermic and can be
      driven by energy generated by the reaction itself, allowing the
      entire process to be run on only solar energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] As used herein, "shells" encompass tubes, pipes or chambers
      which are elongated along a longitudinal axis. The shells may be
      circular in cross-section (i.e. the shells are cylindrical tubes)
      or may have other shapes in cross-section, including, but not
      limited to ellipses, rectangles or squares. As shown in FIG. 1,
      the outer shell of the reactor may essentially form a cavity which
      is largely non-transparent to solar radiation but contains an
      opening or transparent window to admit solar radiation into the
      interior. In an embodiment, reflection or absorption and
      re-radiation occurs at the inner surface of the outer shell. In an
      embodiment, the inner surface of the outer shell may reflect solar
      and/or infrared radiation. In an embodiment, the inner surface of
      the outer shell reflects both solar and infrared radiation. In an
      embodiment, the inner wall of the outer protection shell is
      reflective or absorbing or re-emitting with respect to radiation
      in the wavelength range 200 nm to 20 micrometers. General designs
      for these types of cavities are known to those skilled in the art.
      In an embodiment, the inner wall of the outer protection shell
      comprises a reflective coating such as a gold, silver, or aluminum
      coating. The reflective coating can reflect incident solar energy
      and infrared (IR) radiation emitted from the inner shells. The
      reflective coating may be protected from oxidation by coating it
      with a thin layer of silica.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In an embodiment, the outer shell may be made of a
      plurality of layers in close proximity to one another. For
      example, the outer shell may have three layers. A three-layer
      outer shell may have an outer layer made of a metal (e.g. steel or
      an aluminum alloy), a middle layer made of a thermally insulating
      material (e.g. a refractory material such as alumina), and an
      inner layer which may be either absorbing or reflective. An
      absorbing inner layer may be made of a material having relatively
      low thermal conductivity and capable of withstanding high
      temperatures (e.g. zirconia, hafnia, alumina). In an embodiment,
      the absorbing inner layer is constructed of ytrria-stabilized
      zirconia (YSZ) which heats upon contact with solar energy and
      re-radiates to the reactor tubes. A reflecting inner layer may be
      made of a metal such as steel and coated with a gold or silver
      film; in such case a cooling mechanism may be provided in the
      middle layer to prevent melting of the reflective material. A
      reflecting inner layer may also be made of polished aluminum. In
      an embodiment, the outer shell contains a transparent window. Such
      a window may be a rectangular vertical quartz window (with the
      long axis of the rectangle aligned perpendicular to the
      longitudinal axis of the reactor).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In an embodiment, the outer shell effectively comprises two
      layers, an outer layer and an inner reflecting or absorbing layer.
      In an embodiment, the outer layer is made of quartz and the inner
      layer is a coating of a reflective material such as silver or
      gold. The coating is applied to the sections of the internal wall
      of the shell where sunlight is not being concentrated and entering
      the vessel in order to keep the concentrated sunlight inside the
      reactor. If such a reflective coating is used, there must be an
      uncoated transparent section, window or opening to allow the
      concentrated sunlight into the vessel. The shell wall transparent
      area, allowing for concentrated sunlight entry and subsequent
      solar thermal heating, should be selected to provide heating
      during the desired reaction residence time requirements for the
      process. If the temperatures at the outer shell wall exceed the
      melting temperature of the reflective coating, cooling is provided
      to prevent melting of the reflective coating.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In another embodiment, the outer shell may be formed of a
      single layer of material. In this embodiment, the shell is of a
      material which is either transparent or contains a hole or window
      which admits solar radiation to the interior.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Suitable transparent materials for the outer shell include
      oxidation resistant materials such as quartz. The "protection"
      shell may also be made of a metal with a sufficiently high melting
      point, such as stainless steel. The metal "protection shell" may
      have a transparent window which allows concentrated sunlight to
      directly heat the "heating" shell. At least part of the
      non-transparent part of the "protection" shell can be surrounded
      by heat transfer fluid contained by a jacket to provide cooling of
      the outer metal refractory "protection" shell, particularly in the
      region immediately surrounding the window. The heat transfer fluid
      can be water or a molten salt such as a mixture of sodium and
      potassium nitrates. Molten salts are capable of operating at
      temperatures up to about 500[deg.] C. Use of such a cooling jacket
      can allow for significantly improved efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In an embodiment, the "reaction" or "heating" shell may be
      surrounded by refractory insulation in the region where it is not
      directly exposed to concentrated sunlight via the transparent
      section. The insulation may be concentrically placed and extends
      substantially from the "reaction" or "heating" shell to the
      concentric "protection" shell, although it may not completely fill
      the space between the heating shell and the protection shell. The
      refractory insulation can be a combination of graphite insulation
      near the "heating" shell and an alumina type refractory insulation
      near the "protection" shell. This design arrangement allows
      concentrated sunlight to enter through a transparent section and
      heat the "reaction" or "heating" shell while the surrounding
      insulation reduces conductive and convective losses of energy from
      the "reaction" or "heating" shell, thereby increasing the
      efficiency of the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The innermost reaction shell has an inlet and an outlet for
      the entraining gas stream. The inlet end of the inner shell is the
      upstream end of the shell, while the outlet end is the downstream
      end. The interior of the innermost shell defines a reaction
      chamber within which the high temperature reaction takes place.
      The innermost shell is capable of emitting sufficient radiant
      energy to raise the temperature of the reactants within the
      reaction chamber to a level required to initiate and sustain the
      desired chemical reaction. The innermost shell is made of a high
      temperature refractory material. When the particles are indirectly
      heated, the refractory material subsequently heats flowing biomass
      particles flowing through the first inner shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] In an embodiment, the refractory material is substantially
      chemically unreactive with the particles or the reactant or
      product gases. In an embodiment, the innermost shell is graphite.
      In other embodiments, the innermost shell is silicon carbide or a
      refractory metal or alloy capable of withstanding the temperature
      required for a given decomposition reaction. Other suitable high
      temperature ceramics include ytrria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ),
      silicon nitride, hafnium boride, hafnium carbide, silicon
      carbide-silicon carbide composites, boron nitride or alumina
      (aluminum oxide). Refractory metal alloys suitable for
      temperatures below about 1200[deg.] C. include, but are not
      limited to, high temperature superalloys, including nickel-based
      superalloys such as Inconel(R) or Haynes(R) 214. In another
      embodiment, the innermost shell may be made of quartz. In an
      embodiment, the reaction shell is made of silicon carbide,
      Inconel, quartz, silicon nitride, or alumina.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The inner reaction shell may be made of a nonporous
      material. In another embodiment, the innermost shell is at least
      partially porous. The innermost shell may be wholly of porous
      material or may comprise one or more regions of porous material.
      The porous region(s) of the innermost shell are selected so that
      sufficient uniform flow of gas occurs radially inward through the
      pores to provide a fluid-wall protective blanket for the radially
      inward surface of the innermost shell. The porosity of the porous
      region(s) can be varied and is selected on the basis of the
      required gas flow and allowable pressure drop to provide for a
      fluid-wall of gas. The length of the porous section(s) of the
      "reaction" shell can be varied and is determined by the zone where
      oxidation of the "reaction" shell or particle deposition is most
      likely to occur. The placement of the porous section along the
      length of the "reaction" shell is determined by the same
      considerations. In an embodiment, the length of the porous section
      of the "reaction" shell is limited to where it is needed. The
      entry of fluid-wall gas into the "reaction" shell increases the
      overall volumetric flow rate of gases through the "reaction"
      shell, thus reducing residence time and limiting the production
      throughput of the reactor. In an embodiment, the porosity in a
      given porous region is substantially uniform. A partially porous
      reaction tube may be made by joining together a porous tube and a
      solid tube. Graphite tubes may be joined by high temperature
      sintering using a carbon-containing paste. Silicon carbide tubes
      may also be joined by sintering with the appropriate sintering
      aid. Metal or alloy tubes may be welded or brazed, including
      porous metal or alloy sections. In different embodiments, the
      ratio of the length of the reaction shell to the inner diameter of
      the reaction shell is from 2 to 12, from 2 to 4, from 4 to 6, from
      6 to 12, between 5 and 30, between 5 and 10, and between 20 and
      25.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] When a plurality of reaction shells are present in the
      reactor, the reaction shells may have the same inner diameter or
      may have different inner diameters. In an embodiment, the inner
      shells have different inner diameters and smallest inner shell has
      an inner diameter one third the inner diameter of the largest
      inner shell. In this embodiment, the larger inner shells may be
      located closer to the center of the outer shell then the smaller
      inner shells.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] If used, the second inner shell is typically composed of
      nonporous high temperature refractory material. In an embodiment,
      the second inner shell is made of solid graphite. As previously
      discussed, the second inner shell can function as a "heating"
      shell, since it radiates heat to the innermost shell. In addition,
      the combination of the first and the second inner shell can at
      least partially define a plenum or volume for the fluid-wall gas.
      Depending on the material of the second inner shell, a
      non-oxidizing and non-dissociating "purge" gas may be flowed in a
      second plenum substantially located between the outer shell and
      the second inner shell to protect the second inner "heating" shell
      from oxidation. The purge gas may be argon, helium, neon,
      nitrogen, or any other chemically inert gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In general, the shells comprising the reactors of the
      invention may be positioned vertically or horizontally, or in any
      other spatial orientation. For the case of a vertical reaction
      shell process, the apparatus may be arranged to provide upward or
      downward flow of the gas stream and the cloud of particles. Upward
      flow guarantees that aggregated particles will not be carried
      through the reaction shell. Downward flow reduces the potential
      for plugging in the solids feed line. Preferably, the reactor
      shell is positioned vertically and flow is downward.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Each of the shells is characterized by a longitudinal axis
      (vertical centerline). In the plane created by cross-sectioning
      the reactor transverse to the longitudinal axis of the outer shell
      so that the plane passes through the outer shell window or
      aperture, a first horizontal dividing line (this line can also be
      termed the horizontal centerline) can be defined which passes
      through the center of the outer shell and the window or aperture,
      dividing the outer shell and the window or aperture into two equal
      or nearly equal halves. This horizontal centerline can be said to
      establish right and left portions inside the outer shell. A second
      horizontal dividing line can be established in the same plane
      which passes through the center of the outer shell, is orthogonal
      to the horizontal centerline, and establishes front and back
      portions inside the outer shell, with the front portion being the
      portion nearest the aperture or window.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] To describe positions of the inner shells within the outer
      shell in a horizontal cross-section of the outer shell, an x,y
      coordinate system can be defined whose origin is at the center of
      the outer shell and in which the y axis of the coordinate system
      is aligned with the horizontal centerline as defined above and the
      x axis of the coordinate system is aligned with the second
      horizontal dividing line as defined above.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Locations of the inner shells can also be specified by
      their distance from particular locations with respect to the outer
      shell. For example, the location of the center of an inner shell
      can be specified by its distance from the intersection of the
      horizontal centerline with the inner surface of the outer shell at
      the "back" portion of this inner surface, opposite the aperture or
      window. Locations may also be determined with respect to the
      center of the outer shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Locations of the inner shell can also be specified by their
      orientation with respect to the average direction of the solar
      radiation entering the solar reactor. In an embodiment, the
      average direction of the solar radiation is generally aligned with
      the horizontal centerline.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] If the center of a first inner shell is "farther back" in
      the outer shell than the center of a second inner shell, the y
      component of the distance between the center of the first inner
      shell and the intersection of the horizontal centerline with the
      "back portion" of inner surface of the outer shell is smaller than
      the y component of the distance between the center of the second
      inner shell and the intersection of the horizontal center line
      with this back portion of the inner surface of the outer shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] In an embodiment, at least three inner shells are located
      within the outer shell. In another embodiment, the number of inner
      shells is from 3 to 10. In other embodiments, the number of inner
      shells is 3 or 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In an embodiment, the outer walls of the inner shells are
      not in contact with one another. In an embodiment, the spacing
      between the outer walls of the inner shells is a multiple of the
      diameter of an inner shell. In different embodiments, this
      multiple is 0.05 to 1.0, 0.05 to 0.1, 0.1 to 0.2, 0.2 to 0.5 and
      0.5 to 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The inner shells may be arranged in a variety of
      configurations. For convenience, the configurations may be
      described by the relative positions of the centers of the inner
      shells in a planar cross-section transverse to the longitudinal
      axis of the outer shell. In an embodiment, the centers of the
      inner shells do not lie along a single straight line.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In an embodiment, the centers of the inner shells lie along
      a circular arc, with the ends of the arc being established
      (anchored) by the positions of the center of the inner shells
      closest to the outer shell. The arc is bisected by the horizontal
      centerline. In an embodiment, the circular arc is a semicircle. In
      an embodiment the center of the arc is farther back in the shell
      than the ends of the arc (the arc bows towards the aperture).<br>
      <br>
      [0080] In another embodiment, the inner shells are arranged in a
      staggered pattern. In an embodiment, the inner shells can be
      grouped into a plurality of rows, each row being generally
      perpendicular to the horizontal centerline but having a different
      depth within the outer shell (different y coordinate). The rows
      may form a straight line or they may be somewhat curved. In an
      embodiment, the rows form a straight line parallel to the x axis.
      The centers of the shells in each row are positioned so that they
      do not "line up" with (do not have the same x coordinate as)
      shells in adjacent rows. Each row has at least one shell, and may
      have a plurality of shells. In an embodiment, the pattern is
      generally symmetric about the horizontal centerline. The pattern
      can also be viewed in terms of the geometric properties of lines
      drawn between the centers of neighboring inner tubes. For example,
      the angle made between a line drawn between the center point of a
      first inner tube in a "front" row and the center point of a second
      neighboring tube in the row behind the "front" row and the line
      drawn between the center point of the second tube and the center
      point of a third inner tube located in the "front" row (which is a
      neighbor to both the first and second tube) can be from 40 degrees
      to 140 degrees or from 60 degrees to 130 degrees. The specific
      arrangement is chosen so as to maximize interception of incident
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In an embodiment, three inner shells are arranged in a
      triangular configuration, so that the line between the centers of
      the shells forms a triangle in a horizontal cross-section. One of
      the shells is located farther back in interior of the outer shell
      than the other two. This can be viewed as a first row of two
      shells and a second row of one shell, with the second row being
      farther back than the first row. In an embodiment, the center of
      inner shell in the second is located along the horizontal
      centerline.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] In another embodiment, five inner shells are arranged in a
      staggered pattern. The five inner shells can be separated into a
      first group of three inner shells and a second group of two inner
      shells, the two inner shells in the second group being located
      farther back in the tube than the three inner shells in the first
      group. In an embodiment, the width (x component of the distance)
      spanned by the first group of shells is greater than the width
      spanned by the second group. If lines are drawn between the center
      points of neighboring inner tubes, a pattern of triangles may be
      formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] In an embodiment, the invention provides a solar thermal
      reactor system for heating particles entrained within a gas, the
      reactor comprising:<br>
      <br>
      [0084] a) an outer shell, the side wall of the outer shell not
      permitting transmission of solar radiation except at a window or
      aperture in the side wall, at least a portion of the side wall
      interior away from the window or aperture comprising a material
      reflective to solar radiation wherein in a cross-section of the
      reactor made through the outer shell window or aperture and
      perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the outer shell, the
      outer shell is characterized by a horizontal centerline which
      extends through the window or aperture;<br>
      <br>
      [0085] b) at least three inner shells at least partially located
      within the outer shell, each inner shell having a longitudinal
      axis parallel to the longitudinal axis of the outer shell, wherein
      the inner shells are not concentric and are arranged so that the
      outer side walls of the inner shells are not in contact with each
      other and so that in the reactor cross-section, the centers of the
      inner shells are not aligned along a single straight line; c) a
      particle entrainment feeding system in fluid communication with
      the inner shells; and d) a source of concentrated solar radiation
      disposed so that the window or aperture of the outer shell is
      exposed to solar radiation<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In the entrained flow reactors used in the practice of the
      invention, the biomass particles or droplets are entrained in the
      carrier gas and are generally transported along the longitudinal
      axis of the reaction tube (or tubes). The biomass particles or
      droplets are dispersed in the reactor apparatus, and the form of
      dispersion is important. Preferably, the particles or droplets
      flow as a dust or particle cloud through the apparatus, dispersed
      in a dispersing process gas. Preferably, the particles are
      non-agglomerated. In an embodiment, the biomass is in the form of
      solid particles. In an embodiment, the solid biomass particles are
      not enclosed in water droplets. Several different methods can be
      used to disperse solid particles. In an embodiment, the particles
      are entrained by a fluidized bed feeder. The particles can also be
      dispersed mechanically, such as by shearing on the surface of a
      rotating drum or brush. Alternatively, the particles can be
      dispersed using the shear provided by high velocity gas exiting
      with the particles from a feed injection tube. Experience has
      shown that the exiting "tip speed" from the injection tube should
      be at least 10 m/s to provide the shear necessary for complete
      dispersion of fine powders. In other embodiments, the biomass
      feedstock may also be a liquid and atomized into the aerosol
      stream or a solid mixed with liquid to create a slurry which is
      then introduced into the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The initial composition of the gas used to entrain the
      biomass particles or droplets may be an inert gas, steam, a
      recycled or compatible reaction product gas such as hydrogen,
      carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, or a mixture thereof. In an
      embodiment, the entraining gas is a mixture of inert gas and
      steam. Suitable inert gases include, but are not limited to
      nitrogen, argon, helium, or neon. In an embodiment, the initial
      composition of the entraining gas does not contain substantial
      amounts of molecular oxygen or air. The composition of the
      entraining gas may also vary along the reactor. For example, the
      entraining gas may be provided as an inert gas at the reactor
      inlet and become a mixture of inert gas and gaseous reaction
      products downstream of the reactor inlet. Steam can be introduced
      after the particles are entrained in a gas mixture, but prior to
      introduction of the entrained particles into the reactor. Steam
      can also be fed through a steam micronizer as jets of steam,
      located at the feed inlet of the reactor. In this case, jets of
      steam impinge on biomass being fed and provide a means to reduce
      the particle size of the biomass feed in-situ at the entrance of
      the reactor. The entraining gas stream is selected so that it is
      compatible with the biomass particle pyrolysis or gasification
      process and the "reaction" wall of the solar-thermal fluid-wall
      reactor. The gas stream can be preheated to reduce the
      requirements of the solar thermal field and increase efficiency by
      passing it through a heat exchanger, removing heat from the
      products of the solar thermal reactor. Additionally, heat could be
      removed from an exothermic downstream fuel processing unit
      (Fischer-Tropsch reactor, water gas shift reactor, or combustion
      turbine).<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In the methods of the invention, biomass particles are
      heated at least in part with a source of concentrated sunlight.
      The source of concentrated sunlight may be a solar concentrator.
      Preferably, the solar concentrator of the apparatus is designed to
      optimize the amount of solar thermal heating for the process.
      Solar fluxes between about 1000 and about 3000 kW/m&lt;2 &gt; have
      been shown to be sufficient to heat solar thermal reactors to
      temperatures between 1000 and 2500 K. In different embodiments,
      the solar flux is from 500 to 1500 kW/m&lt;2&gt; , from 1500 to
      3500 kW/m&lt;2&gt; , from 3000 to 5000 kW/m&lt;2&gt; , or from
      3500 to 7000 kW/m&lt;2&gt; . Fluxes above 3000 kW/m&lt;2 &gt; may
      be used achieve even higher temperatures, receiver efficiencies,
      and reactor throughputs, although the cost of using fluxes in this
      range is expected to be higher. Since the solar radiation is
      generally focused to approximately match the aperture/window size,
      the size of the aperture and the flux are correlated.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The temperature inside the innermost shell of the reactor
      can be measured with a thermocouple. Alternatively, temperatures
      inside the reactor can be measured with an optical pyrometer. For
      a three-shell reactor, the hot zone temperature measured with an
      optical pyrometer is typically the temperature of the nonporous
      "heating" shell, since the "heating" shell encloses the "reaction"
      shell in the hot zone. The temperature inside the inner "reaction"
      shell may be less than that of the "heating" shell due to thermal
      losses due to heating the porous shell and the gases in the first
      plenum and the reaction shell.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The sunlight can be provided in the form of a collimated
      beam (spot) source, a concentric annular source distributed
      circumferentially around the reactor, or in the form of a
      linearized slot source providing heating axially along the length
      of reactor. The light can be redirected and focused or defocused
      with various optical components to provide the concentration on or
      in the reactor as required. In an embodiment, the concentrated
      solar radiation is further concentrated by a secondary
      concentrating reflector before entering the reactor. An example of
      a suitable solar concentrator for use in the present invention is
      the High-Flux Solar Furnace (HFSF) at the National Renewable
      Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colo. The HFSF uses a series
      of mirrors that concentrate sunlight to an intensified focused
      beam at power levels of 10 kW into an approximate diameter of 10
      cm. The HFSF is described in Lewandowski, Bingham, O'Gallagher,
      Winston and Sagie, "Performance characterization of the SERI
      Hi-Flux Solar Furnace," Solar Energy Materials 24 (1991), 550-563.
      The furnace design is described starting at page 551, wherein it
      is stated,<br>
      <br>
      The performance objectives set for the HFSF resulted in a unique
      design. To enable support of varied research objectives, designers
      made the HFSF capable of achieving extremely high flux
      concentrations in a two-stage configuration and of generating a
      wide range of flux concentrations. A stationary focal point was
      mandatory because of the nature of many anticipated experiments.
      It was also desirable to move the focal point off axis. An
      off-axis system would allow for considerable flexibility in size
      and bulk of experiments and would eliminate blockage and
      consequent reduction in power.<br>
      In particular, achieving high flux concentration in a two-stage
      configuration (an imaging primary in conjunction with a nonimaging
      secondary concentrator) dictates a longer f/D [ratio of focal
      length to diameter] for the primary [concentrator] than for
      typical single-stage furnaces. Typical dish concentrators used in
      almost all existing solar furnaces are about f/D=0.6. To
      effectively achieve high flux concentration, a two-stage system
      must have an f/D=2. Values higher than this will not achieve
      significantly higher concentration due to increased losses in the
      secondary concentrator. Values lower than this will result in a
      reduction of maximum achievable two-stage flux. At low values of
      f/D, the single stage peak flux can be quite high, but the flux
      profiles are also very peaked and the average flux is relatively
      low. With a longer f/D, two-stage system, the average flux can be
      considerably higher than in any single-stage system. The final
      design of the HFSF has an effective f/D of 1.85. At this f/D, it
      was also possible to move the focal point considerably off axis
      (30[deg.]) with very little degradation in system performance.
      This was because of the longer f/D and partly because of the
      multi-faceted design of the primary concentrator. This off-axis
      angle allows the focal point and a large area around it to be
      completely removed from the beam between the heliostat and the
      primary concentrator.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] When the outer shell is wholly transparent or has a window
      which extends completely around the shell, the concentrated
      sunlight is preferably distributed circumferentially around the
      reactor using at least one secondary concentrator. Depending upon
      the length of the reaction shell, multiple secondary concentrators
      may be stacked along the entire length of the reaction shell. For
      the HFSF described above, a secondary concentrator that is capable
      of delivering 7.4 kW of the 10 kW available (74% efficiency)
      circumferentially around a 2.54 cm diameter*9.4 cm long reaction
      tube has been designed, constructed, and interfaced to the
      reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The invention also provides reactor systems which combine
      the reactor of the invention with one or more other system
      elements. Typically, the outlet of the reactor will be coupled to
      a device for collecting any solids exiting the reactor. These
      solids may be unreacted or partially reacted biomass particles,
      ash, or reaction products. Any suitable solids collection device
      known to the art may be used, including, but not limited to
      gravity collection vessels and filters.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] As used herein, the "residence time" is the time that the
      biomass particles spend in the hot zone of the innermost
      "reaction" shell. The hot zone length may be estimated as the
      length of the reactor directly irradiated by the source of
      concentrated sunlight. The residence time depends on the reactor
      dimensions, such as the hot zone length and the inner diameter of
      the "reaction" shell. The residence time also depends on the flow
      rate of the entraining gas stream containing the biomass particles
      and the flow rate of any fluid-wall gas through the pores of the
      inner shell. In addition, the residence time may vary across the
      diameter of the reaction shell, in which case a mean residence
      time may be calculated. The residence time may be calculated
      through modeling or estimated from ideal gas considerations. In
      different embodiments, the residence time is less than or equal to
      10 seconds, less than or equal to 5 seconds, or less than or equal
      to 3 seconds. The biomass may or may not be completely reacted
      before it leaves the hot zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] If used, the fluid-wall gas is selected to be compatible
      with the reactants and the products. The fluid-wall gas is
      compatible if it allows the desired reaction to take place and/or
      it is inert to the reactants, products, and materials of
      construction for the reaction and protection shells and/or is not
      difficult to separate from the gas stream exiting the "reaction"
      shell and/or the cooling device. The fluid-wall gas used in the
      solar-thermal reactor is also selected so that it is compatible
      with the "reaction" shell. The gas stream used to provide the
      "fluid-wall" blanket gas flowing inward from the porous "reaction"
      shell wall is also preferably not a dissociating gas whose
      dissociation products would plug the pores of the porous wall.
      Inert gases, such as helium, N2 or argon are suitable for use as
      the fluid-wall gas<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Downstream separation units are used to remove entrainment
      gas from the reaction products and separate the reaction products
      based on the end application. Possible separation units include
      pressure swing adsorbers, vacuum swing absorbers, membrane
      separators, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, CO2 in the
      reaction products is recycled and used as the entrainment gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Products from the process can be used in a number of ways.
      These ways include, but are not limited to:<br>
      <br>
      [0099] 1) Combination of product hydrogen and carbon monoxide or
      carbon dioxide in a Fischer-Tropsch (FT) style reactor to produce
      hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons could include, but are not
      limited to, methanol, methane, gasoline (C5-C12), ethanol,
      propane, butane, diesel fuels, jet fuels, and specialty organic
      chemical products. Uses for such hydrocarbons would include
      transportation fuels, heating fuels, and fuels for stationary
      electric power generation, but the uses are not limited to these.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] 2) Combination of the carbon monoxide product with
      additional water in a Water-Gas Shift reactor to produce
      additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The product hydrogen could
      be used in fuel cells for electrical power generation, as a
      combustion fuel, as a desulfurization agent for gasoline,
      transportation fuels, or coal, or for specialty chemical
      synthesis, but its uses are not restricted to this. 3) Direct
      separation of the product hydrogen for use as specified in #2) 4)
      Direct combustion of the product stream for power generation, heat
      generation, or other similar purposes.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Cellulose Gasification in an Electrically Heated Aerosol
        Transport Tube Reactor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0106] Cellulose was combined with water vapor in an electric tube
      furnace at temperatures between 1200 K and 1450 K. The cellulose
      was composed of fine particles (Sigma-Aldrich #310697, 20 [mu]m)
      with a monomer unit shown in FIG. 3. The reactor apparatus is
      shown in FIG. 4. The reactor consisted of a 99.8% Alumina tube (3)
      (McDanel Technical Ceramics), 3.635'' in internal diameter by 45''
      in length. This tube was heated indirectly using a surrounding
      electrically heated graphite resistance element (800). The
      interior of the Al2O3 tube was sealed from the outer graphite
      element and purged with argon gas to eliminate oxygen. Particles
      of cellulose were placed in a fluidized bed feeder (500);
      fluidization gas (21) (argon) entrained the particles, carrying
      them into the hot reactor, where they were combined with water
      vapor (23). The water flowrate was controlled by a syringe pump,
      and the water was introduced into the hot reactor environment
      through a capillary tube. The molar feed ratio of cellulose to
      water was approximately 1:1. A pyrometer (700) was used to measure
      the temperature of the reaction tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] After leaving the heated portion of the reactor, the
      reaction products were passed through a gravity collection vessel
      (350) and an HEPA (high efficiency particulate air) filter (400)
      (200 nm pore size). Large particles would be collected in the
      gravity vessel, with smaller, entrained particles accumulating on
      the HEPA filter. The gravity collection vessel was contained in an
      outer containment collection vessel (300). The exhaust gases (26)
      were analyzed using mass spectrometry and NDIR (nondispersive
      infrared) CO/CO2 detection.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Experiments were performed in a 2&lt;2 &gt; full factorial
      design. The two factors were temperature and total entrainment gas
      flow. The larger the value of the entrainment gas flow, the
      shorter the residence time within the reactor. The temperature
      factor levels were 1200 K and 1450 K, and the total gas flow
      factor levels were 10 SLPM and 15 SLPM (standard liters per
      minute).<br>
      <br>
      [0109] At the highest temperature condition and lowest flowrate,
      the mass spectrometer (MS) trace showed an immediate increase in
      H2 production at the start of feeding. (FIG. 5) The scales for the
      different molecules differ, so a relatively larger increase in
      partial pressure of one species does not necessarily mean a larger
      increase in molar flowrate of that species. This was better
      determined by NDIR analysis. An increase in CO concentration
      followed shortly after the H2 peak, and could be seen on the NDIR
      detector. At the start of feeding, the water concentration
      decreased, indicating reaction. This amount recovered with the
      waning of the hydrogen peak, indicating that at least some of the
      hydrogen was coming from the water. Integration under the NDIR
      peak yielded 0.006 mol of CO produced. Based on the amount of
      material fed, this gives conversion of cellulose to CO at 94%.
      When including CO2 production, the conversion increased to 98%.
      This is essentially complete gasification of the feed material. No
      differential pressure increase was detected, and no mass was
      collected in the gravity vessel, on the HEPA filter, or on the
      walls of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Reaction of material at 15 SLPM and 1450 K yielded similar
      results. Gasification conversion of the feed material was 95%, and
      no material was collected in the reactor for 0.9 g fed. There was
      no increase in differential pressure across the HEPA filter,
      indicating no buildup of material.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] At the lower temperature, 950[deg.] C., both flowrate
      conditions also showed fairly high conversion (65%). Much of this
      material was collected in the gravity vessel, and resembled the
      feed material in composition. Also, differential pressure across
      the HEPA filter indicated a large deposit of material, likely
      incomplete products of gasification. This differential pressure
      increased rapidly, and reached a level high enough to trigger the
      safety pressure relief devices on the apparatus. From the
      factorial experiments it was clear that more complete gasification
      was obtained in short residence times at ultra-high temperatures
      (&gt;1000[deg.] C.). These are temperatures are achievable in
      concentrated solar energy systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Lignin Gasification in an Electrically Heated Aerosol
        Transport Tube Reactor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0112] Lignin was combined with water vapor in an electric tube
      furnace at 1450 K. The lignin was composed of fine particles
      (Sigma-Aldrich #371017, 20 [mu]m) with a monomer unit shown in
      FIG. 6. The reactor was the same as in Example 1. The interior of
      the Al2O3 tube was sealed from the outer graphite element and
      purged with argon gas to eliminate oxygen. Particles of lignin
      were placed in a fluidized bed feeder; fluidization gas (argon)
      entrained the particles, carrying them into the hot reactor, where
      they were combined with water vapor. The water flowrate was
      controlled by a syringe pump, and the water was introduced into
      the hot reactor environment through a capillary tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] After leaving the heated portion of the reactor, the
      reaction products were passed through a gravity collection vessel
      and an HEPA filter (200 nm pore size). Large particles would be
      collected in the gravity vessel, with smaller, entrained particles
      accumulating on the HEPA filter. Gas analyses were performed using
      mass spectrometry and NDIR CO/CO2 detection.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] The demonstration experiment was performed at 1450 K and
      around a 1:1.5 molar feed ratio of lignin to water.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] Conversion of the material was essentially complete (98%),
      with products existing as C, CO2, and CO. The C was in the form of
      fine powder and made up about 30% of the carbon in the exit
      stream. With higher ratios of water to lignin, thermodynamics
      allow further gasification of this carbon. The CO2 to CO ratio in
      the outlet gas was about 1:10, showing conversion to favorable to
      CO.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Cellulose and Lignin Pyrolysis in an Electrically Heated
        Aerosol Transport Tube Reactor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0116] Cellulose and lignin were pyrolyzed in an electric tube
      furnace at temperatures between 1200 K and 1450 K. Each material
      was fed in separate experiments. The cellulose was composed of
      fine particles (Sigma-Aldrich #310697, 20 [mu]m) and the lignin
      was also composed of fine particles (Sigma-Aldrich #371017) The
      reactor apparatus is similar to that in Example 1. The interior of
      the Al2O3 tube was sealed from the outer graphite element and
      purged with argon gas to eliminate oxygen. Particles of cellulose
      or lignin were placed in a fluidized bed feeder; fluidization gas
      (argon) entrained the particles, carrying them into the hot
      reactor, where they joined by sweep argon gas to control residence
      time.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] After leaving the heated portion of the reactor, the
      reaction products were passed through a gravity collection vessel
      and an HEPA filter (200 nm pore size). Large particles would be
      collected in the gravity vessel, with smaller, entrained particles
      accumulating on the HEPA filter. Gas analyses were performed using
      mass spectrometry and NDIR CO/CO2 detection.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Experiments were performed in a 2&lt;2 &gt; full factorial
      design for each feed material. The two factors were temperature
      and total entrainment gas flow. The larger the value of the
      entrainment gas flow, the shorter the residence time within the
      reactor. The temperature factor levels were 1200 K and 1450 K, and
      the total gas flow factor levels were 10 SLPM and 15 SLPM.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The mass spectrometry trace for the high temperature, low
      flowrate cellulose pyrolysis experiment is shown in FIG. 7. As can
      be seen, both hydrogen and carbon monoxide increase rapidly upon
      introduction of the feed material. These are the thermodynamically
      expected products, and this trace is representative of all of
      experiments as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] For cellulose pyrolysis, conversion was high at high
      temperatures. For the short residence time point at 1450 K, the
      conversion to CO and CO2 was 80%, with CO:CO2 ratios around 12:1.
      This was similar for the long residence time point, with 85%
      conversion and CO:CO2 ratios near 10:1. The conversion was lower
      in the low temperature points, with a significant amount of solid
      material collected in the reactor (over [1/3] of the mass fed).
      LECO TC600 and C200 (Leco Corp.) analysis showed carbon and oxygen
      levels similar to the feed composition, but structural
      rearrangements would be possible. In any case, at the low
      temperatures, the conversions to carbon oxides in the gas were 60%
      and 61%, with similar CO:CO2 ratios as in the high temperature
      experiments. It is clear that high temperatures (&gt;1300 K)
      produced more effective pyrolysis of this material.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Lignin pyrolysis products included a significant amount of
      fine black powder. LECO C200 analysis of this powder showed it to
      be &gt;96% carbon for each of the high temperature points, and a
      lower &gt;75% carbon for the low temperature experiments. This is
      likely due to unreacted lignin in products. Conversion to CO was
      higher at higher temperatures, being between 40% and 45%. These
      are right around the theoretical maximum, although some adsorbed
      water on the feed material could push the theoretical conversion
      higher due to gasification. The conversion was lower at 1200 K, at
      16% and 18% for the low and high residence time points,
      respectively. In all of the experiments, the ratio of CO to CO2 in
      the exit stream was between 8:1 and 10:1.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Cellulose Gasification in Solar Heated Aerosol Transport
        Tube Reactor</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0122] Cellulose was combined with water vapor, at a temperature
      of 1423 K, in a solar heated tube furnace. The solar reactor
      apparatus is shown in FIG. 8. The reactor consisted of a 99.8%
      alumina tube (3) (CoorsTek ceramics) having an inner diameter of
      0.75'' and a total length of 14''. The heated length of the tube
      was 8''. The tube was surrounded by a quartz sheath, sealed to the
      outside air and purged with argon gas. The cellulose was composed
      of fine particles (Sigma-Aldrich #310697, 20 [mu]m). The cellulose
      particles (28) were introduced into the system from the top using
      a fluidized bed feeder (500). Argon was used as the fluidization
      gas (21) to entrain the particles and carry them into the hot zone
      of the reactor, where they combined with water vapor. The water
      was introduced into the reactor with a syringe pump. The molar
      feed ratio of cellulose to water was approximately 1:1.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] The tube was heated with concentrated solar energy at the
      High Flux Solar Furnace facility at the National Renewable Energy
      Laboratory. The solar concentration of the system at the front of
      the secondary concentrator (50) was approximately 1000 suns
      (approximately 1000 kW/m&lt;2&gt; ), and at the exit of the
      concentrator was approximately 2000 suns (approximately 2000
      kW/m&lt;2&gt; ).<br>
      <br>
      [0124] After leaving the heated portion of the reactor, the
      reaction products were passed through a gravity collection vessel
      and a HEPA filter (200 nm pore size). Large, heavy particles were
      collected in the gravity vessel (350), while smaller, entrained
      particles collected on the HEPA filter (400). The product gas (26)
      was analyzed using a mass spectrometer (MS).<br>
      <br>
      [0125] The entrainment gas flow rate correlated to the residence
      time of particles within the reactor. For this experiment, the
      entrainment flow rate was set to 1.25 SLPM. The MS trace showed an
      immediate increase in H2 and CO production at the onset of
      particle feeding, accompanied by a decrease in the water trace,
      indicating reaction of the water and cellulose (FIG. 9). The
      correlation between partial pressure and concentration for each
      species differ, so a relatively larger increase in the partial
      pressure of one species does not necessarily mean a larger
      increase in the molar flow rate of that species. Calibration of
      the MS device allowed to convert the partial pressure measurements
      to moles produced. After integrating the carbon monoxide and
      comparing it to the cellulose mass feed, the conversion of
      cellulose to CO was determined to be 92%. No carbon dioxide was
      detected in the outlet stream.<br>

      </b><b>Gasification of Clippings of the Grass Poa pratensis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0126] To demonstrate the gasification of biologically derived
      cellulose and lignin, grass clippings of the species Poa pratensis
      were gasified in an electrically heated aerosol transport tube
      reactor at a temperature of 1450 K. Sample preparation was as
      follows. 4 grams of clippings of the species Poa pratensis were
      rinsed in ethanol, and the rinsed clippings vacuum filtered. The
      residual clippings were dried for 24 hours in a vacuum furnace at
      200[deg.] C. The dried material was ground with a mortar and
      pestle until there were no longer fibers longer than 1 mm in the
      sample. These clippings were loaded into a fluidized bed feeder.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] The reactor apparatus the same as that in Example 1. The
      interior of the Al2O3 tube was sealed from the outer graphite
      element and purged with argon gas to eliminate oxygen. Particles
      of grass were placed in a fluidized bed feeder; fluidization gas
      (argon) entrained the particles, carrying them into the hot
      reactor, where they were combined with water vapor. The water
      flowrate was controlled by a syringe pump, and the water was
      introduced into the hot reactor environment through a capillary
      tube. The molar feed ratio of grass to water was approximately
      1:1.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] After leaving the heated portion of the reactor, the
      reaction products were passed through a gravity collection vessel
      and an HEPA filter (200 nm pore size). Large particles would be
      collected in the gravity vessel, with smaller, entrained particles
      accumulating on the HEPA filter. Gas analyses were performed using
      mass spectrometry and NDIR CO/CO2 detection.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] 3.2 g of powder was fed into the reactor during the
      experiment. After the experiment, 0.28 g were collected in the
      gravity collection vessel, and 0.15 g were collected on the HEPA
      filter. This material was a fine black powder, and LECO C200
      analysis confirmed it to consist of greater than 95% carbon. The
      mass spectrometer trace for the experiment is shown in FIG. 10.
      Less than 10% of the evolved gaseous carbon was as CO2. Conversion
      to CO of the feed carbon was 64%, nearly all of the unconverted
      carbon existing as the fine black powder collected.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLE 6</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Hydrogen Production Using Zn as an Energy Storage Medium</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0130] Biomass particles are reacted with zinc oxide (ZnO)
      particles, using the solar thermal process described herein.
      Sunlight is used to drive the endothermic biomass pyrolysis
      (biomass to CO/H2/C) and carbothermal reduction of ZnO (C,
      CO+ZnO-Zn+CO/CO2) reactions. The reactor temperature can be
      between approximately 1400 and 2200 K. The reaction is extremely
      fast at the high temperatures achieved via solar-thermal heating.
      The primary pyrolysis/carbothermal reduction products are Zn
      metal, H2, CO, and CO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] After cooling, the Zn metal is a solid and can be easily
      separated from the gaseous products and stored. The gaseous H2,
      CO, CO2 mixture can be fed to a conventional catalytic water gas
      shift reactor with water feed to carry out water gas shift
      (CO+H2O-CO2+H2) reaction producing H2 and CO2. The H2 can be used
      as a fuel or chemical feedstock for another process. The CO2 can
      be released to the atmosphere or fed to a greenhouse to grow
      biomass. The solar-thermal reactor process provides Zn metal to a
      Zn metal storage system and a water gas shift reactor feed at high
      rates on-sun. The Zn is effectively an energy storage medium. A
      secondary step in which the Zn is reacted at approximately 700 K
      with steam to produce H2 and ZnO is an exothermic process, and can
      be operated autothermally. Hence, the Zn/steam reactor can be
      designed to operate at a rate consistent with the production of Zn
      on-sun ([1/3] to [1/4] of the time) from the solar-thermal step
      (hence, the Zn/steam reactor will operate to react Zn at a rate of
      about [1/3] to [1/4] of the rate at which Zn is being produced
      on-sun, since on-sun time is [1/3] to [1/4] of the typical day).
      The Zn storage will increase during the daytime when the
      solar-thermal process is operating and will decrease during the
      evening when Zn is not being produced on-sun. The ZnO produced via
      the Zn/steam reaction step is recycled back to the solar-thermal
      reactor for on-sun reduction to produce Zn. The Zn/ZnO is a closed
      loop cycle. A schematic of this process is given in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Combined Solar-Thermal Biomass/Zn Process with Coal
        Hydrogenation Process</b><br>
      <br>
      [0132] A solar-thermal biomass/Zn process, producing renewable H2,
      can be integrated with a conventional fossil feed process. Such a
      process represents a transitional bridge to a truly hydrogen
      economy. FIG. 12 illustrates a process to produce methane by
      reacting coal with renewable hydrogen. In this process, H2 is
      supplied continuously via the Zn/steam reactor while the H2/CO/CO2
      from the on-sun solar-thermal reactor is supplied to a continuous
      water gas shift reactor, downstream of the coal hydrogenation
      reactor. The resulting product is CH4 out of a methanator. The
      renewable H2 to the process is supplied via pyrolyzed biomass from
      solar-thermal pyrolysis and water from the Zn/steam reactor. The
      carbon to the process is supplied by the coal and the biomass. The
      coal hydrogenator should be operated at high pressure of 1,000
      psig or greater. The hydrogen from the Zn/steam reactor can be
      supplied at the required delivery pressure in the reactor or may
      require compression.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Reduction of Fe3O4 by CO and H2 and Generation of H2 by
        Reaction of Water with the Reduced Products</b><br>
      <br>
      [0133] To demonstrate the feasibility of Fe3O4 reduction by the
      products of biomass gasification, Fe3O4 was loaded in a platinum
      crucible in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The system was
      heated to 1000[deg.] C. under 200 sccm of argon gas flow. At
      1000[deg.] C., the temperature was held constant while 22.5 sccm
      of H2 and 22.5 sccm of CO were introduced into the system. The
      mass of the sample decreased, indicating a reduction reaction; the
      change in mass was commensurate with that for complete reduction
      to FeO. The gas products were analyzed using mass spectrometry,
      and the trace for this analysis is shown in FIG. 13. As can be
      seen, both CO2 and H2O were produced by reaction, indicating
      reduction by both CO and H2. In a second experiment, the iron
      oxide reduced in the first experiment remained in the Pt crucible
      while water was introduced at 400[deg.] C. The mass of the sample
      increased, with a total level commensurate with re-oxidation of
      the FeO to Fe3O4. Gases were analyzed using mass spectrometry. As
      can be seen in FIG. 14, hydrogen was produced during a
      corresponding dip in the water concentration. These experiments
      demonstrate the viability of cycling iron oxide through reduction
      and oxidation steps for energy storage and hydrogen generation.<br>
