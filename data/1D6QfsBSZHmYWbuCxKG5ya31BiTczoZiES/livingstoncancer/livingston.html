      Cancer is the most frightening human disease and its cause remains
      elusive. Therefore, it seems inconceivable that the discovery of a
      germ cause of cancer would provoke such hostility among the cancer
      establishment. But, in truth, the belief in a cancer germ has
      always been the ultimate scientific heresy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In the long history of cancer research there was never a physician
      more outspoken and controversial than Virginia Wuerthele-Caspe
      Livingston (1906-1990). For more than 40 years she championed the
      revolutionary idea that bacteria caused cancer and devised a
      treatment to try and combat these microbes by immunotherapy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Sixteen years after her death she is now largely forgotten but
      still condemned by such powerful organizations as the American
      Cancer Society-and blacklisted on Quackwatch-a self-proclaimed
      "non-profit corporation dedicated to combating health-related
      frauds, myths, fads, and fallacies. "<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>LIVINGSTON'S CANCER RESEARCH</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      Beginning in the late 1940s, Livingston was able to grow bacteria
      from cancer tumors; and when she and her associates injected
      cancer bacteria into laboratory animals, some developed cancer.
      Other animals developed degenerative and proliferative diseases,
      and some animals remained healthy. Livingston believed the
      "immunity" of the host was an important factor in determining
      whether cancer would develop.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><b><img src="Livingston.jpg"
            alt="virginialivingston" width="198" height="259"><br>
          Virginia Livingston MD <br>
          (1906-1990)</b><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b>&nbsp;<br>
      In 1969 at a meeting at the New York Academy of Sciences ,
      Livingston and her colleagues proposed that cancer was caused by a
      highly unusual bacterium which she named Progenitor
      cryptocides-Greek for 'ancestral hidden killer.' Neverthless,
      Livingston claimed elements of the microbe were present in every
      human cell. Due to its biochemical properties, she believed the
      organism was responsible for initiating life and for the healing
      of tissue-and for killing us with cancer and other infirmities.
      Critics of this research continued to insist there was no such
      thing as a cancer germ.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In her attempt to use a variety of modalities (diet, supplements,
      antibiotics, as well as traditional methods) to treat cancer, she
      utilized an 'autogenous' vaccine derived from the patient's own
      cancer bacteria found in the urine and blood. Livingston explained
      it was not an anti-cancer vaccine, but rather a vaccine to help
      stimulate and improve the patient's own immune system. The
      administration of this unapproved vaccine caused a furor in the
      cancer establishment and eventually legal action was undertaken
      against her and the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic in San Diego. In
      spite of all her legal troubles, she continued seeing patients
      until her death at 83.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In March 1990, the year of her death, a highly critical article on
      the Livingston-Wheeler therapy appeared in the American Cancer
      Society-sponsored CA: A Cancer Journal for Physicians. (No authors
      were listed.) The report advised patients to stay away from the
      San Diego clinic and claimed: "Livingston-Wheeler's cancer
      treatment is based on the belief that cancer is caused by a
      bacterium she has named Progenitor cryptocides. Careful research
      using modern techniques, however, has shown that there is no such
      organism and that Livingston-Wheeler has apparently mistaken
      several different types of bacteria, both rare and common, for a
      unique microbe. In spite of diligent research to isolate a
      cancer-causing microorganism, none has been found. Similarly,
      Livingston-Wheeler's autologous vaccine cannot be considered an
      effective treatment for cancer. While many oncologists have
      expressed the hope that someday a vaccine will be developed
      against cancer, the cause(s) of cancer must be determined before
      research can be directed toward developing a vaccine. The
      rationale for other facets of the Livingston-Wheeler cancer
      therapy is similarly faulty. No evidence supports her contention
      that cancer results from a defective immune system, that a
      whole-foods diet restores immune system deficiencies, that
      abscisic acid slows tumor growth, or that cancer is transmitted to
      humans by chickens." (The full report is on-line at: <br>

      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      <b>BACTERIA AS A CAUSE OF CANCER</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      The recognition of disease-producing bacteria allowed medical
      science to emerge from the dark ages into the era of modern
      medicine. In the late nineteenth century when diseases like
      tuberculosis (TB) , syphilis, and leprosy were proven to be caused
      by bacteria, some doctors also suspected human cancer might have a
      similar cause.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The idea that bacteria cause cancer is considered preposterous by
      most physicians. However, despite the antagonistic view of the
      American Cancer Society and medical science, there is ample
      evidence in the published peer-reviewed literature that strongly
      suggests that 'cancer microbes' cause cancer.<br>
      <br>

      </div>
      <b> </b><b>&nbsp;</b><br>
      According to reports by Livingston and various other researchers,
      cancer is caused by pleomorphic, cell wall deficient bacteria. The
      various forms of the organism range in size from submicroscopic
      virus-like forms, up to the size of bacteria, yeasts, and fungi.
      In culture and in tissue the bacterial forms are variably
      'acid-fast' (having a staining quality like TB bacteria). These
      bacteria are ubiquitous and exist in the blood and tissues of all
      human beings (yet another 'heresy'). In the absence of a
      protective immune response, these cell wall deficient bacteria may
      become pathogenic and foster the development of cancer ,
      autoimmune disease, AIDS, and certain other chronic diseases of
      unknown etiology.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Needless to say, all this research fell on dead ears because
      bacteria were totally ruled out as the cause of all cancers in the
      early years of the twentieth century. Thus, bacteria observed in
      cancer were simply dismissed as elements of cellular degeneration,
      or as invaders of tissue weakened by cancer, or as 'contaminants'
      of laboratory origin.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      <b>LIVINGSTON AND PROGENITOR CRYPTOCIDES</b><b><br>
      </b><b>&nbsp;</b><br>
      Beginning in1950, in a series of papers and books, Livingston and
      her co-workers claimed the cancer microbe was a great imitator
      whose various pleomorphic forms resembled common staphylococci,
      diphtheroids, fungi, viruses, and host cell inclusions. Yet if the
      germ were studied carefully through all its transitional stages,
      it could be identified as a single agent. She was the first to
      suggest that the acid-fast stain was the key to the identification
      of the cancer microbe in tissue and in culture; and also
      demonstrated its appearance in the blood of cancer patients, by
      use of dark-field microscopy.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Anyone who takes the time to read Livingston's reports in the
      medical literature will quickly recognize that she was a credible
      research scientist, who allied herself with other experts-and was
      certainly not the quack doctor pictured by her detractors. Her
      achievements in cancer microbiology can also be found in her
      autobiographical books: Cancer, A New Breakthrough (1972); The
      Microbiology of Cancer (1977); and The Conquest of Cancer (1984).
      Her research has been confirmed by other scientists, such as
      microbiologist Eleanor Alexander-Jackson, cell cytologist Irene
      Diller, biochemist Florence Seibert, and dermatologist Alan
      Cantwell, among others.<br>

      <b>THE CANCER MICROBE AND BACTERIAL PLEOMORPHISM</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      Microbiologists have long resisted the idea of bacterial
      pleomorphism, and do not recognize or accept the various growth
      forms and the bacterial 'life cycle' proposed by various cancer
      microbe workers. Most bacteriologists do not accept the idea of a
      bacterium changing from a coccus to a rod, or to a fungus.
      Depending on the environment, the microbe in its cell
      wall-deficient phase may attain large size, even larger that a red
      blood cell. Other forms are submicroscopic and virus-sized.
      Electronic microscopic studies and photographs of filtered
      (bacteria-free) cultures of the cancer microbe show virus-size
      elements of the cancer microbe that can revert into
      bacterial-sized microbes.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The cancer microbe has adapted to life in man and animals by
      existing in a mycoplasma-like or cell wall deficient state. In
      tissue sections of cancer stained for bacteria with the special
      acid-fast stain, the microbe can be seen as a variably acid-fast
      (blue, red, or purple-stained) round coccus or as barely visible
      granules . At magnifications of one thousand times (in oil), these
      forms can be observed within and also outside of the cells.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Careful study and observation of the tiny round coccoid forms in
      cancer tissue indicate they can enlarge progressively up to the
      size of so-called Russell bodies, which are well-known to
      pathologists. Russell bodies can attain the size of red blood
      cells, and even larger.<br>
      <br>
      William Russell was a well-respected Scottish pathologist who in
      1890 first reported the finding of 'cancer parasites' in the
      tissue of all the cancers he studied. However, modern pathologists
      deny that Russell's bodies are microbial in origin. For more
      information on Russell bodies and Russell's 'cancer parasite' (and
      its intimate relationship to cancer microbes), Google: The
      forgotten clue to the bacterial cause of cancer; or go to: <br>

      <b>OVERLOOKING HIDDEN BACTERIA IN CANCER</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      Once bacteria were eliminated as a cause of cancer a century ago,
      it became dogma and impossible to change medical opinion. In this
      current era of medical science, one would think it impossible for
      infectious disease experts and pathologists to not recognize
      bacteria in cancer. However, bacteria can still pop up in diseases
      in which they were initially overlooked.<br>
      <br>
      When a new and deadly lung disease broke out among legionnaires in
      Philadelphia in July 1976, two hundred twenty-two people became
      ill and thirty-four died. The cause of the killer lung disease
      remained a medical mystery for over five months until Joe McDade
      at the Leprosy Branch of the CDC detected unusual bacteria in
      guinea pigs experimentally infected with lung tissue from the dead
      legionnaires. Further modification of bacterial culture methods
      finally allowed the isolation of the causative and previously
      overlooked bacteria, now known as Legionella pneumophila.<br>
      <br>
      Lymph node showing Hodgkin's lymphoma. Arrows point to
      variably-sized round coccoid forms and larger Russell bodies. Gram
      stain; magnification x1000, in oil. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Yet another example of dogma-defying research is provided by
      recent studies proving that bacteria (Helicobacter pylori) are a
      common cause of stomach ulcers, which can sometimes lead to
      stomach cancer and lymphoma. For a century, physicians refused to
      believe bacteria caused ulcers because they thought bacteria could
      not live in the acid environment of the stomach. In 2005 the Nobel
      Prize in Medicine was awarded to two Australian researchers for
      their 1982 discovery. These stomach bacteria could only be
      detected by use of special tissue stains. The CDC now claims that
      H. pylori causes more than 90% of duodenal ulcers and 80% of
      gastric ulcers. Approximately two-thirds of the world's population
      is infected with these microbes.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In the past four years there have been medical reports of newly
      discovered bacteria in serious lymph node disease; in Hodgkin's
      lymphoma; in cancer of the mouth; and in prostate cancer, to name
      only a few.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      All these studies prove bacteria can pop up in diseases where they
      are least expected. Such a caveat is appropriate for doctors who
      think they know everything about cancer and who pooh-pooh all
      aspects of cancer microbe research.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>A CENTURY OF CANCER MICROBE RESEARCH</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      Livingston never claimed that she was the discoverer of the
      microbe of cancer. In her writings she always gave credit to
      various scientists, some dating back to the nineteenth century,
      who attempted to prove that bacteria cause cancer. Some of these
      remarkable researchers include the long-forgotten cancer microbe
      studies of Scottish obstetrician James Young, Chicago physician
      John Nuzum, Montana surgeon James Scott, the infamous psychiatrist
      and cancer researcher Wilhelm Reich, microscopist Raymond Royal
      Rife, and others too numerous to mention.<br>
      <br>
      This cancer microbe research has been explored in my books The
      Cancer Microbe: The Hidden Killer in Cancer, AIDS, and Other
      Immune Diseases [1990] and in Four Women Against Cancer: Bacteria,
      Cancer, and the Origin of Life [2005]-the story of Livingston,
      Alexander-Jackson, Diller and Seibert-four outstanding women
      scientists who attempted to bring the cancer microbe to the
      attention of a disinterested medical establishment. I was
      privileged to have met all these remarkable women, who greatly
      influenced my own cancer research.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Why is research exploring bacteria in cancer so strongly opposed?
      Perhaps it poses a threat to the money interests involved in the
      established and orthodox treatment for cancer. Various forms of
      cancer treatment include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.
      These therapies might have to be reevaluated if it were proven
      that cancer was an infectious disease.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>

      </b><br>
      Further information pertaining to cancer microbe research (both
      pro and con) can be found by Googling: cancer microbe; bacterial

      For a list of scientific publications pertaining to the
      microbiology of cancer, go to the PubMed website hosted by the

      IC", "Seibert FB", etc. in the search box.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This short communication is unlikely to convince many health
      professionals that bacteria cause cancer. However, after four
      decades of studying cancer microbes in cancerous tissue, I am
      personally convinced that Dr. Virginia Livingston will one day be
      vindicated and recognized as one of the greatest medical geniuses
      of the twentieth century.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Ralph W Moss, cancer advocate and author of The Cancer Industry,
      notes her passing was "a major loss to the cancer world." In the
      Cancer Chronicles #6, 1990, he writes, "Virginia Livingston was a
      great person and a great scientist. Sadly, she never received the
      recognition she deserved in her lifetime. The true scope of her
      achievements will only become known in years to come."<br>

      Virginia Livingston (1906–1990) was an American physician and
      cancer researcher who advocated the unsupported theory that a
      specific species of bacteria she named Progenitor cryptocides was
      the primary cause of cancer in humans. Her theories about P.
      cryptocides have not been duplicated by researchers, and a
      clinical trial of her therapy did not show any efficacy in the
      treatment of cancer. The American Cancer Society, which did not
      support Livingston’s treatment protocol for cancer, categorically
      denied her theory of cancer origins.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Life</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Virginia Livingston was born Virginia Wuerthele in Meadville,
      Pennsylvania in 1906.<br>
      <br>
      Both her father and grandfather were physicians and she also
      pursued a degree in medicine. Prior to attending medical school,
      Livingston earned three BA degrees in English, history, and
      economics from Vassar College. She then attended New York
      University, Bellevue Medical College and in 1936, received her
      degree in medicine. She was one of four women in her graduating
      class.[1]<br>
      <br>
      Shortly after graduation, Livingston became the first female
      resident physician at a New York hospital where she was assigned
      to treat prostitutes infected with venereal diseases. While there,
      Livingston became interested in the study of tuberculosis and
      leprosy, and later scleroderma, a disease affecting the tissues
      and skin. After studying scleroderma tissues with the darkfield
      microscope, she claimed to find an acid-fast organism that
      consistently appeared in her slides. Thinking that scleroderma had
      some characteristics that were like cancer, Livingston then began
      studying malignant tissues and subsequently claimed to find
      evidence of acid-fast organisms in every sample. It was this early
      research that prompted the young physician to devote her career to
      the study of a specific microorganism involved in cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Early research</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1946, Livingston published a paper in which she stated she had
      established that a bacterium was a causative agent in
      scleroderma.[2] In 1947, she cultured a mycobacteria-like organism
      in human cancer and, according to her peer-reviewed paper,
      fulfilled Koch's postulates establishing an apparent cause and
      effect.[3] In 1949, Livingston was named chief of the
      Rutgers-Presbyterian Hospital Laboratory for Proliferative
      Diseases in New Jersey where she continued her cancer research.[4]
      It was during this time that Livingston formed a lifetime
      association with Dr. Eleanor Alexander-Jackson of Cornell
      University. Jackson's specialty was the study of mycobacteria and
      particularly, the species responsible for tuberculosis. Jackson
      had developed specific culture media for growing the microbe and a
      technique for observing it known as the "triple stain" because she
      felt this microbe wasn't amenable to conventional modes of
      culturing and microscopy.<br>
      <br>
      Livingston and Jackson also collaborated on work on the Rous
      sarcoma virus (RSV) at Lederle Laboratories. Livingston claimed
      that when RSV cultures were passed through special filters
      designed to hold back all but the smallest virus particles, she
      was able to grow bacteria; this was considered a controversial
      claim since bacteria are considerably larger than viruses and are
      not supposed to exist in filtered RSV serum. After healthy animals
      were exposed to the Rous bacterial filtrates, Livingston and
      Jackson claimed that cancerous lesions developed.[5] This finding
      led to speculation that such bacteria could be transmitted from
      poultry to humans and this became a primary reason Livingston
      ordered her cancer patients to not eat poultry while they
      underwent her treatment. Scientists have since rejected Livingston
      findings, arguing there is no evidence supporting her claim.[6]<br>
      <br>
      In 1956, Livingston published a paper suggesting a causative
      bacterium in Wilson's disease.[7] In 1965, she reported isolation
      of a variably acid-fast mycobacterium in patients with myocardial
      vascular disease. During this time, she also began a small test
      trial of anti-bacterial vaccines made from the body fluids of
      cancer patients and reported moderate success.[8] Between the
      years 1965-1968, Livingston received Fleet Foundation and Kerr
      Grants, and continued her investigation into a bacterial cause of
      human cancer. She also published a paper describing the presence
      of a substance identified as Actinomycin-D which she said could
      damage chromosomes and promote cancer.[9]<br>
      <br>
      In 1969, Livingston and her husband Afton Munk Livingston,
      established the Livingston-Wheeler Clinic in San Diego,
      California, and began formally treating cancer patients. The
      therapeutic program included autogenous vaccine made from killed
      bacteria derived from body fluids; a low sodium diet consisting of
      organic foods, fruits and vegetables high in a substance
      Livingston called "abscisic acid"; immune enhancing vaccines
      (gamma globulin, BCG) and antibiotics. Livingston prescribed
      antibiotics after cross testing them with patients' cultures to
      see which had the most antibacterial activity. Livingston also
      recommended that patients not consume poultry products based on
      her earlier research.<br>
      <br>
      After her husband’s death, she married Owen Webster Wheeler, one
      of the first patients she claims to have successfully treated for
      head and neck cancer. Shortly after, the clinic was renamed the
      Livingston-Wheeler clinic. In 1970, Livingston officially named
      her cancer organism Progenitor cryptocides, and presented her
      findings to the New York Academy of Sciences.[10] According to her
      biography, Progenitor was a pseudonym meaning "ancestral" and the
      name was chosen because Livingston believed the microbe existed as
      early as the Precambrian era, and it was an endegenous component
      of life itself. The name "cryptocides" was a Greek and Latin word
      which meant "hidden killer". The microbe was classified under the
      order Actinomycetales. Livingston described Progenitor as an
      intermittently acid-fast mycobacterium that displayed highly
      variable growth cycles. According to Livingston the microbe was
      pleomorphic, and had cell wall-deficient and filter-passing forms
      resembling viruses, with the ability to adopt a variety of shapes
      including spindles, rods and cocci.[10]<br>
      <br>
      <b>1974-1990</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1974, Livingston published a paper which described her
      isolation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from cancer
      bacteria.[11] She then advanced one of her central hypotheses.<br>
      <br>
      Livingston theorized that hCG is both a component of human cancer,
      but also innately involved in embryonic growth and fetal
      survival.[4] She wrote that hCG is saturated in the placenta, and
      blocks the mothers’ antibodies from attacking the fetus, partly
      made of foreign DNA (and not recognized by host immunity). By the
      same token, hCG performs a similar function in cancer, conferring
      protection to malignant tissues. Livingston believed that after
      Progenitor hybridizes with cancer cells, it imparts an ability for
      them to produce hCG in a manner similar to that of the developing
      fetus. Based on this duality of function, Livingston called hCG
      “the hormone of life and the hormone of death”. She also
      stipulated that vaccines which target hCG-producing bacteria could
      also halt the progression of cancer. And she claimed that absicins
      could also neutralize hCG.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Controversy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Though some bacteria have been associated with cancer[12] (for
      instance H. pylori has been associated with stomach cancer[13])
      Livingston's postulated relationship between cancer and P.
      cryptocides was never proven in several follow up studies
      conducted by independent investigators. Researchers confirmed that
      bacteria provided by Livingston produced hCG, but several other
      studies demonstrated that numerous bacteria in both cancer
      patients and healthy individuals also produced the substance.<br>
      <br>
      Occurring before the existence of techniques to analyze DNA,
      Livingston and other investigators' ability to differentiate
      bacteria based on morphology and chemical characteristics was
      limited. However, even given technological limitations at the
      time, Livingston's classification methods were described as full
      of "remarkable errors", attributing characteristics to
      Actinomycetales (the order Livingston believed P. cryptocides
      belonged to) shared by no other members of the order. Some
      evidence supports P. cryptocides is the result of a mistaken
      identification of a Staphylococcus strain of bacteria and later
      studies of the samples provided by Livingston proved to be
      Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus faecalis.[6]<br>
      <br>
      The American Cancer Society (ACS) did not support Livingston’s
      treatment protocol for cancer, and has categorically denied her
      theory of the cancer bacterium P. cryptocides the primary cause of
      human cancer. The ACS also challenged the efficacy of Livingston’s
      autogenous vaccine and concluded in its report that there was no
      corroboration of either P. cryptocides or the efficacy of her
      autologous vaccine.[6] Since Livingston hadn’t stocked earlier
      cultures of her alleged microbe, it is not possible to decipher
      precisely what those cultures contained.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Clinical testing</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A case-control study using self-selected, matched but not
      randomized groups with late stage cancer compared survival and
      quality of life between cancer patients receiving conventional
      treatment and those undergoing the Livingston-Wheeler therapy. The
      results were reported in The New England Journal of Medicine in
      1991, and found no differences in survival among patients whether
      treated conventionally, or via Livingston's treatment. The NEJM
      report also stated that when comparing the two groups, the
      "quality of life were consistently better among conventionally
      treated patients from enrollment on". Based on this trial, the ACS
      deemed Livingston's cancer therapy without efficacy, and
      considered it an "unproven therapy".[14]<br>
      <br>
      While both groups of patients in the trial deteriorated at equal
      rates---all in effect dying of their disease---patients in the
      Livingston-treated group were reported to have had a "poorer
      quality of life" at the start of the trial.[14] The study's lead
      investigator, Barrie Cassileth, acknowledged that "the University
      of Pennsylvania patients had a significantly better quality of
      life at all times, including enrollment" and that, quality of life
      "was different at base line", with Livingston's patients rated
      worse.[14] Patients in both treatment arms also received
      conventional therapies in addition to Livingston's therapy.
      Livingston's patients also received BCG during the trial---an
      FDA-approved cancer adjuvant which has been found effective for
      several cancers, including those of the bladder and colon.<br>
      <br>
      At the study's conclusion, Barrie Cassileth commented:<br>
      <br>
      "This study...involved only patients with diagnoses and stages of
      disease for which there is no effective conventional treatment.
      Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to patients with less
      advanced stages of disease or to other treatment regimens."
      Cassileth also said, her study group "hypothesized that survival
      time would not differ between the two groups on the basis of the
      assumption that the unproved remedy would be no more effective
      with end-stage disease than conventional care, itself largely
      ineffective".<br>
      <br>
      <b>Death</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Shortly after speaking before an Office of Technology Assessment
      (OTA) hearing on alternative cancer therapies and attending her
      60th reunion at Vassar College in 1990, Livingston accompanied her
      daughter Julie Anne Wagner on a European trip. She developed chest
      pains while visiting the Greek islands and then succumbed to heart
      failure in Athens on June 30, before being transported to a Paris
      Hospital.[15]<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Livingston-Wheeler's cancer treatment is based on the belief that
      cancer is caused by a bacterium she has named Progenitor
      cryptocides. Careful research using modern techniques, however,
      has shown that there is no such organism and that
      Livingston-Wheeler has apparently mistaken several different types
      of bacteria, both rare and common, for a unique microbe. In spite
      of diligent research to isolate a cancer-causing microorganism,
      none has been found. Similarly, Livingston-Wheeler's autologous
      vaccine cannot be considered an effective treatment for cancer.
      While many oncologists have expressed the hope that someday a
      vaccine will be developed against cancer, the cause(s) of cancer
      must be determined before research can be directed toward
      developing a vaccine. The rationale for other facets of the
      Livingston-Wheeler cancer therapy is similarly faulty. No evidence
      supports her contention that cancer results from a defective
      immune system, that a whole-foods diet restores immune system
      deficiencies, that abscisic acid slows tumor growth, or that
      cancer is transmitted to humans by chickens.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b>Guinea pigs became skin-positive to test doses of PPD
      (purified protein derivative-Seibert) and to other related PPD
      preparations in various degrees following immunization with
      phenolized cultures of Progenitor cryptocides, an intermittently
      acid-fast pleomorphic filterable Actinomycete isolated from human
      cancer patients. This reactivity, indicative of the relationship
      to M. tuberculosis as well as to several other related microbes,
      may account for the effective treatment of some types of human
      cancer with BCG (Bacillus Calmette Guérin). Another property of P.
      cryptocides is the production in vitro of a parahormone
      immunologically and biologically related to human chorionic
      gonadotropin. Since the cancer patient often exhibits various
      types of hormonal imbalance, the microbic exogenous production of
      this hormone may explain the neoplastic parahormone syndrome in
      man. There are some biological differences in experimental animals
      between the microbic and human chorionic gonadotropin, but the in
      vitro and radioimmunological tests are identical. The microbic
      hormone appears to play an important role in human cancer, since
      it not only is present in tumors, body tissues, and fluids but may
      be excreted in large amounts in the urine. The amount excreted is
      variable, depending upon the rate of microbic production of the
      hormone in vivo and the resistance of the host as expressed
      through immunological and metabolic degradation systems.<br>

            Cancer Cure</b><br>
        </font></div>
      <br>
      During the last hundred years, a surprisingly large number of
      doctors&nbsp; have found ways to cure or alleviate cancer. These
      ways are not the Big Three – surgery, radiation, and chemo – that
      are the ones almost exclusively recommended by the profession.<br>
      <br>
      Let’s begin with Virginia Livingston (1906-1990), a graduate of
      Bellevue Medical School, daughter of Herman Wuerthele, MD
      (1885-1967). In her first book, Cancer: A New Breakthrough (1972),
      she claimed a success rate of 82%. Here are four cases:<br>
      <br>
      D.K. – Age 71, operated on for carcinoma of prostate, followed by
      removal of testicle, 1966. He had multiple spinal metastases and
      arthritis of many joints. He was barely able to move around. He
      was placed on autogenous vaccine and mandelamine, 1 gram four
      times a day with dietary and vitamin adjuvants. Previous to his
      prostatic surgery he had a bowel resection for cancer of the
      colon. At the present time the spinal metastases have healed, he
      says he has no evidence of arthritis, is in perfect health and
      works.<br>
      <br>
      J.M. — Age thirty-five, had a left radical mastectomy March 3,
      1965, when four months pregnant. Pathological diagnosis was
      infiltrating&nbsp; arcinoma, scirrhus and medullary types. After
      delivery of a normal child she had a hysterectomy May 28, 1965,
      and was placed on estrogen therapy from August 24, 1966, through
      January 9, 1967. Autogenous vaccine was made which she took for a
      year and intermittently since. This type of tumor is universally
      fatal. Her physician says she is in good health at the present
      time (1972) with no signs of recurrence.<br>
      <br>
      F.B. — Male age twenty-seven from Utah, who was operated on for
      severe headaches after a number of convulsive seizures. The
      pathological diagnosis was astrocytoma, grade III to IV,
      infiltrating the surrounding area. He received anti-convulsants,
      radiotherapy and antibiotics. In 1966 when he was doing very badly
      and appeared to be terminal, he was placed on autogenous vaccines
      and mandelamine, one gram four times daily, plus vitamins and
      dietary supplements. He remained on this regimen for two years.
      The vaccine was discontinued in October 1970. His physician said
      there is no evidence of any tumor.<br>
      <br>
      A Longshoreman, age 46, operated 1967, for a mass on the right
      side of his neck. Pathological diagnosis was malignant lymphoma,
      reticulum-cell type with invasion of all glands. These were not
      resectable because they extended under the sternocleidomastoid
      muscle. He received X-ray, 4500 R, in eighteen treatments. Since
      then he has had no other treatment except autogenous vaccine
      continuously with erythromycin 250 mgm twice a day. He says he is
      completely well and works full time on the docks.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Leprosy the Clue</b><br>
      <br>
      After World War II, Virginia worked in a New York hospital and saw
      many cases of TB (tuberculosis) and leprosy. Note: every
      physician’s experience is unique. It is incorrect to think that
      all doctors possess the same knowledge; much depends on who
      happens to walk into their office one fine day.<br>
      <br>
      One fine day into Virginia’s office (she was a school doctor)
      walked the school nurse, complaining of ulcers on the fingers, a
      perforation in the septum (the piece of cartilage that separates
      the two nostrils), and hardening of the skin. This was in 1947.
      Her own doctor had given her a diagnosis of scleroderma.<br>
      <br>
      Virginia associated the symptoms with leprosy as the patient
      reported that she could not feel hot or cold on the affected skin.
      Virginia Livingston decided to do some lab work on this case. She
      took smears from the woman’s nose and the ulcers on her hands and
      stained them with the stain used for identifying both leprosy and
      TB, namely a “Ziehl-Neelsen” stain.<br>
      <br>
      Peering into the microscope, Virginia saw the same type of
      microorganisms one sees in leprosy. She treated this patient with
      the medication used for lepers, and the skin healed. Later,
      Virginia gave the same medication to other scleroderma patients
      and it worked!<br>
      <br>
      Whatever she saw in the microscope that day became central to her
      later theory that cancer is explainable by bacteria. That has not
      been widely accepted. But she made a separate discovery that did
      later become standard in science. Namely, she found that bacteria
      can and do secrete a hormone, human chorionic gonadatropin, hCG,
      which is essential for human life. Hooray!<br>
      <br>
      <b>In a Nutshell, Livingston’s Theory</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Virginia believed that cancer is not a foreign visitor. It is part
      of our body from birth and it is never going to go away. Cancer is
      characterized by mitosis, the dividing and replication of cells.
      Cell division itself is not to be despised; it is the basis of our
      initial growth in childhood, and occurs as part of the repair work
      that steadily goes on in the body. When a piece of skin gets
      scraped off, you just wait for it to regrow. We need cell
      division!<br>
      <br>
      If cell division gets out of control, however, it may make tumors.
      Tumors are bunches of new cells that don’t associate in the normal
      manner with surrounding cells and have no purpose. A cancer doctor
      has the title “oncologist” from the Greek word onco for mound.
      Virginia never became a “moundologist.”<br>
      <br>
      She surmised that a tumor happened because the person’s immune
      system was not functioning as it normally does. As for the cancer
      microbe that she believed to be ever-present in our body, she gave
      it the name Progenitor cryptocides (crypto=stealth; cide=to kill).<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Livingston Program for Treating Cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Virginia Livingston does not claim to have invented the bacterial
      theory of cancer. Others such as William Russell and Royal Rife,
      she notes, got there first.<br>
      <br>
      Now have a look at what she prescribes: she tells the cancer
      patient to get his Progenitor cryptocides back under control. That
      is something that, in a healthy person, is taken care of by the
      immune system.<br>
      <br>
      When your immune system sees the cryptocides microbes going where
      they shouldn’t go, she says, it treats them as invaders and acts
      to protect you. The immune system is ever-alert for the
      non-normal, and can do what must be done.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Run-of-the-mill miracles.</b><br>
      <br>
      One cancer patient, a physician named Owen Wheeler, was cured by
      Virginia, and subsequently married her. They established the
      Livingston-Wheeler Clinic in San Diego, and helped thousands of
      persons.<br>
      <br>
      But what if your immune system is not working well and can’t call
      up the right response? Then a tumor may form. Stuff may also
      travel around your body and metastasize.<br>
      <br>
      What should the doctor do? She will try to get your immune system
      working again.<br>
      <br>
      Livingston’s treatment program has two prongs:<br>
      <br>
      Use nutrition to build up the immune system. She advises fresh
      fruits, vegetables, and nuts (nothing out of a can). No meat or
      dairy until you are recovered. Lots of Vitamins A and C, and<br>
      <br>
      Vaccinate the patient with the antigen he needs. Material for that
      vaccination comes from the patient himself; his urine is used to
      culture the bacteria which are then made into an autogenous
      vaccine. In some cases she also gives antibiotics. She often gives
      a blood transfusion, from a family member.<br>
      <br>
      <b>“Getting” Virginia Livingston</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Virginia was still working at her clinic at age 83 when the
      government closed it down. The feds and most states do that to any
      doctor who dares defy the rule to use only the Big Three cancer
      cures. (surgery, chemo, radiation).<br>
      <br>
      A few months after that, she expired.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Livingston constantly made her patient’s progress available for
      inspection by the medical authorities. She also arranged for a
      random survey of the records, going so far as to hire an outsider
      to choose 62 cases under a meticulous set of guidelines. Yet when
      she published the survey no one was wiling to read it.<br>
      <br>
      In the back of her book you will find a section with the pitiful
      heading “Ten Cases That I Wish Someone Would Investigate.”<br>
      <br>
      In 2001, Saul Green wrote a bad evaluation of Livingston for Sloan
      Kettering, making nary a mention of cures she wrought for 20
      years! He did, however, importantly remind us that it is a felony
      in California to treat a cancer patient with unapproved methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cantwell and Pleomorphism</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One physician who came to Livingston’s aid was Los Angeles
      dermatologist Alan Cantwell, MD.<br>
      <br>
      He had already published his clinical finding of a cancer microbe,
      in 1968, before he got to know Livingston. Cantwell spends much
      time at an ordinary microscope using an “oil immersion lens” that
      allows him to see what most pathologists claim they don’t see. He
      credits a Spanish microbiologist for giving him the clue to
      cancer’s similarity to tuberculosis:<br>
      <br>
      “[Conrado] Xalabarder totally transformed my concept about how
      tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria reproduce and grow and
      drastically change their appearance.”<br>
      <br>
      Ah, changing appearance – and behavior – and size, and – who
      knows? Maybe their species identity – is the name of the game for
      the bacteria we are concerned with here.<br>
      <br>
      The pioneering taxonomist, Carolus Lineaus, born 1707 in Sweden,
      grouped animals together in phyla based on shared characteristics,
      for example, he put Homo sapiens into the phylum chordata, as we
      share the characteristic of having a backbone. (Sigh. If only we
      had backbone, and not just a backbone!)<br>
      <br>
      When a bacterium is not encased in the normal way by a cell wall
      (that is, when it’s CWD – cell-wall deficient), it has potential
      to sneak around and get up to no good. Harken to this:<br>
      <br>
      “There is increasing evidence that CWDB and CWD fungi are often
      associated with endocarditis, septicemia, meningitis, pneumonia,
      and infections of bones and joints. When prompt diagnosis is
      critical, it is helpful to include examination for CWD
      microorganisms as part of the first laboratory study.”<br>
      <br>
      That’s from an article that Lida Mattman, and her co-author Mehnga
      S. Judge, contributed to Domingue’s Cell Wall-Deficient Bacteria.
      (1982: 440). Amazingly, it did not spark eager research as to its
      rather glaring potential for meningitis cases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PATENT</b><br>
      <br>
      Patent #4, 692, 412 (expiry date 2006) was awarded to V.
      Livingston, and Afton Livingston, and Eleanor Alexander-Jackson
      for the making of an autogenous vaccine from the blood or urine of
      cancer patients. Their application for the patent claimed:<br>
      <br>
      “All cancerous bloods examined have revealed the cryptocides
      organisms. [It] is apparently ubiquitous in nature, existing in a
      reservoir in soil and water, and is found in all classes of
      animals…. It can exist as a latent infection in host tissue
      without causing apparent ill effects. However, when the
      immunologic barriers are lowered it can invade the host in
      prodigious numbers and involve any or all of the host tissues,
      causing various kinds and degrees of pathologic change.” [Note:
      Award of patent does not mean claim proven.]<br>
      <br>
      This Patent’s Method for Making Autogenous Vaccine:<br>
      <br>
      “Obtain a midstream clean-catch specimen of urine in a sterilized
      screw-top glass container. Make up DiFco’s brain-heart infusion
      agar: 37 grams of the agar base are added to a liter of distilled
      water heated to melt and mix, and distributed into flasks or
      bottles of 95 ml amounts, and autoclaved. Five percent (5%) human
      blood … is added when the melted agar has cooled down to 45-50
      degrees C., and the mixture is poured into sterile Petri dishes.
      Streak the surface of the blood agar plate with a sterile swab
      dipped in the urine. Incubate plate to 37 degrees C. and examine
      after 24 hours.<br>
      <br>
      “If growth has appeared, note types of colonies, make duplicate
      smears, and stain one by Gram’s stain and the other by
      Alexander-Jackson’s modified Ziehl-Neelsen technique: flood slide
      with Kinyoun’s carbolfuchsin for 3 to 5 minutes in the cold, wash,
      decolorize briefly with 70% alcohol containing 1 to 3% HCl as
      these organisms decolorize more readily than M. tuberculosis,
      counter stain by flooding slide with Loeffler’s methylene blue and
      add 6 to 8 drops of normal (4%) sodium hydroxide. Tilt slide to
      mix, and wash after 30 seconds.”...<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      <b>Clinical Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Livingston-Wheeler Therapy is an alternative approach to cancer
      treatment that gained popularity from the 1970s to early 1990. It
      used several treatments to supposedly stimulate the immune system,
      including a strict vegetarian diet, BCG vaccine, coffee enemas,
      autogenous vaccine, vitamins, antibiotics, antioxidants,
      nutritional counseling, and support groups/counseling. The regimen
      was based on the theory that cancer was caused by the bacterium
      Progenitor cryptocides, which developer Virginia
      Livingston-Wheeler reported to have isolated in a wide variety of
      cancer tissues (3) (4). A weakened immune system would then allow
      the bacterium to grow, and consequently the therapy’s focus was
      immune-stimulation. Although a number of viruses and bacteria have
      been associated with various cancers (8), a link between the
      bacteria named by Livingston-Wheeler and cancer was never
      confirmed by independent researchers.<br>
      <br>
      A self-selected, matched-cohort, prospective comparison of
      patients at Livingston-Wheeler Clinic and a conventional cancer
      center found no difference in survival times between groups, but
      did find consistently lower quality of life in the
      Livingston-Wheeler cohort (6).<br>
      <br>
      Metabolic diets may result in nutrient deficiencies (5). Repeated
      use of coffee enemas has been linked to several deaths from
      serious infection and electrolyte imbalance (2). In a 1990
      position paper, the American Cancer Society urged cancer patients
      not to use these treatments (1).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mechanism of Action</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although a number of viruses, bacteria, and parasites have been
      associated with various cancers (8), a link between the bacteria
      named by Livingston-Wheeler and cancer was never confirmed by
      independent researchers. Rather, independent analyses of cultures
      provided by Livingston-Wheeler identified these bacteria as Staph
      epidermis, Strep faecalis, Staph faecalis, and other unrelated
      bacteria (1).<br>
      <br>
      In a 1990 position paper, the American Cancer Society urged cancer
      patients not to use this treatment, as no evidence supports its
      efficacy (1). In addition, although the Livingston-Wheeler diet
      was similar to recommendations made by the American Cancer
      Society, its nutrient deficits, especially for calcium, iron,
      vitamins D and B12, and protein, would be unsuitable for some
      cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Adverse Reactions</b><br>
      <br>
      Common (metabolic diet): Nutrient deficiencies (calcium, vit B12,
      protein), anemia, and malabsorption may result from metabolic
      diets (1).<br>
      <br>
      Reported (autogenous vaccine): Malaise, aching, slight fever, and
      tenderness at injection site (1).<br>
      <br>
      Case Report (Coffee enemas): Death attributable to fluid and
      electrolyte imbalance causing pleural and pericardial effusions
      after use of coffee enemas, 4 per day for 8 weeks (2).<br>

      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LIVINGSTON VIRGINIA, et al.<br>
      <br>
      A method of preparing an autogenous vaccine for use in improving
      the immunocompetence of animals affected with neoplastic disease
      characterized by the production of choronic gonadotropin by the
      microorganism Progenitor cryptocides, ATCC 31, 874.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to chemical substances comprising a product
      of the growth of a microorganism of Order II, Actinomycetales
      Buchanan, as identified in Bergey's Manual of Determinative
      Bacteriology, Sixth Edition, 1948, p. 111, to method of preparing
      same and isolation thereof and to the chemotherapeutic treatment
      of animals and humans therewith. Published works have identified
      additional species and resulted in a classification of the
      organism under the order Actinomycetales. This order has been
      reclassified as follows:<br>
      ORDER--ACTINOMYCETALES<br>
      family--Progenitoraceae<br>
      genus--Cryptocides<br>
      species--<br>
      Cryptocides tumefaciens<br>
      Cryptocides sclerodermatis (sclerobacillus)<br>
      Cryptocides wilsonii<br>
      stains isolated from lupus erytheuratosis, rheumatoid, arthritis,
      periarthritis, nodosum, sarcoidoses (that is, from collogen
      diseases other than cancer and other such diseases specified
      elsewhere herein)<br>
      varieties: hominis, rodentii, avii, etc. A culture of Progenitor
      cryptocides was deposited in the American Type Culture Collection,
      Accession Number 31,874.<br>
      <br>
      All of the species noted above have been observed to be
      interchangeable within the scope of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      P. Cryptocides has been assayed and assigned the tentative
      formula, C30 H38 N2 O3 (certain products of Cryptocides were
      crystals extracted from cultures of urine from terminal cancer
      patients). Extracts also have been crystallized from the blood and
      urine of cancer patients and the crystals result from the presence
      of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      The microorganism involved (Cryptocides) has been identified as a
      highly pleomorphic intermittently acid-fact micro-organism, with
      both a virus-like and a PPLO or L transitional phase. This
      organism is a great simulator, whose various forms may resemble
      micrococci, diphtheroids, bacilli, fungi, viruses, and host-cell
      inclusions. Cryptocides has the ability to change its form and may
      vary its appearance from that of a fungus to that of a cluster of
      virus-size pleuro-pneumonialike organisms (PPLO or Mycoplasma).
      Collagenophillic mycobacterium-like, which include the cancer
      organism, are able to change their forms. Cryptocides has
      filterable or extremely small forms (submicroscopic) similar to
      viruses, and rather large mycelia. There were some variations as
      to size and some differences in the kind of media or material in
      which it will grow. Certain strains of it ferment one kind of
      sugar, some others, and some can live with little (or no) oxygen,
      whereas some require more. It can be identified as a single agent.
      The microorganism undergoes many changes in morphology and some of
      those forms might be zoogleal or "L" Forms. Zoogleals are
      intermediate forms of microorganisms which ordinarily have cell
      walls, but, in which, under certain circumstances the cell walls
      are absent. Some of these forms can be passed through very fine
      filters that hold back the usual bacteria and allow only very
      small particles such as viruses and small L forms to pass through.
      Such filter-passing bodies can regrow to become bacilli (bacterial
      cultures). The microoganisms involved have many forms but they
      always grow up to be the same thing no matter how often they are
      cultured. Cryptocides is not a virus but is a pleomorphic
      bacterium.<br>
      <br>
      Cryptocides is acid fast, that is, it retains the Ziel-Neelsen
      stain in the presence of acid. Cryptocides is related to the
      tuberculosis family of microbes. It is filterable through filters
      designed to hold back bacteria. It is sensitive to tetracycline,
      kanamycin, ampicillin and furacin, but occasionally resistant to
      pencillin, sulfa drugs and mycostatin. As for the pleomorphism,
      cryptocides exists as virus-sized bodies of 20 to 70 microns, as
      elementary bodies of 0.2 micron, and in coccoidal forms of 0.5
      microns or larger. The latter are usually gram-positive and
      resemble common micrococci but are distinguishable by variation in
      size and the sprouting of filaments or spicules. The organism may
      also appear in amorphous mycoplasmalike forms, as rods or
      filaments of varying lengths, and in older cultures, as spores and
      hyphae.<br>
      <br>
      Cultures made from animal tumors and fluid have great similarities
      with cultures derived from many types of fresh uncontaminated
      human tumors, from blood and other body fluids of patients who
      have advanced cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The L-forms are bacterial forms without cell walls. They resemble
      pleuro-pneumonilike organisms (PPLO), also known as mycoplasma.
      However, the mycoplasma appear to reproduce continously under some
      conditions in the same stage, with the absence of cell walls,
      while other organisms have a tendency to revert more quickly to
      the more stable bacillary or coccal forms of origin. The L-forms
      are the link between bacteria and the viruslike minute bodies that
      are a stage in the life cycle of certain microorganism. Many
      viruses may actually be L-forms of microbes which, under certain
      conditions may be induced to return to their original forms.
      Previously the appearance of the both adult and L-forms led to the
      erroneous conclusion that there was a mixture of microorganisms, a
      contamination of pure strains with other nonrelevant
      microorganisms, but this was shown to be an erroneous
      misconception. Some true contaminants are readily recognized by
      their growth pattern but the Cryptocides is a great simulator of
      other organisms. It requires infinite patience to observe its
      growth pattern and to recognize its transition from one form into
      another.<br>
      <br>
      The microorganism involved requires definitive bacteriologic media
      for its primary isolation, differential staining techniques for
      its identification, high power microscopic resolution, and the
      electron microscope to reveal its most minute forms. Specific
      cultures can be obtained on solid media used for the isolation of
      the tubercle bacillus. This mycobacterium-like organism is
      believed to be a primary etiologic agent in proliferative and
      degenerative diseases such as cancer and perhaps many other
      socalled autoimmune diseases. Cryptocides is believed to be the
      causative or infectious agent (microbial) of cancer, in all of its
      forms, Cryptocides would therefore be called an antigen. More
      specifically, the filterable forms of P. Cryptocides which are of
      virus size are the causative agents in human and animal cancers.<br>
      <br>
      Peyton Rous did not call his tumor filtrates (from chickens)
      viruses but instead "tumor agents." His material could be dried
      and held on a shelf at room temperature for months and then, mixed
      with saline, it could be reactivated to initiate fresh tumors. A
      true virus has been defined as a submicroscopic infectious unit
      that lives only in the presence of living cells and cannot exist
      even momentarily outside of them. Many have tried to find a virus
      implicated in some form of human cancer, but none has been found.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants have grown the Rous tumor agent in sterilized beef
      broth that contained suitable nutrients for bacterial growth, and
      traced its growth pattern through all of the bacteriological
      stages. Applicants knew that the infectious agent passed through
      filters that permitted only the passage of so-called viruses.
      Applicants filtered the cultures, not the extracts of the tumors,
      through bacteria restraining filters and studied these with a
      electron microscope. Applicants kept the cultures in which there
      did not appear to be any visible form of life, incubated them at
      37 DEG C. and from these seemingly clear broths with the agent in
      them, there arose the bacterial and fungal stages of the
      cryptocides. Applicants ruled out contamination that might account
      for the bacterial growth on incubation by repeating the experiment
      dozens of times. It was a tedious process but proved that this
      so-called virus could and did convert to a bacterium that had not
      only submicroscopic forms but also bacillary, coccal or round
      forms, and that could also develop funguslike stages and spores.
      (On studying the growth of the tubercle and lepra bacilli these
      stages were entirely comparable with the Cryptocides.)<br>
      <br>
      When applicants examined the cultures obtained from human cancers,
      there was no discernible difference in the growth pattern. The
      growth pattern of the chicken cancer isolates and that of man were
      the same. They grew in the same kind of broth in the same way and
      they appeared the same in chicken and human tissues. They had the
      same staining properties with the Ziehl-Neelsen dye. Applicants
      did sheep immunization studies in which they found significant
      cross-agglutination between the Rous sarcoma, fowl leukosis and
      various strains of human cancers. When applicants injected the
      isolated cultures into mice, the characteristic disease and
      lesions developed. The Rous isolates had to be readapted to
      chicken tissues by passage on the allantoic membrane of fertile
      eggs and then replanted into young chicks. Applicants also carried
      on immunization of rabbits with the leuokosis agent and used the
      antiserum to cure chickens dying of fowl leukosis. In every way
      the Rous agent appears to be a prototype for human cancer.<br>
      <br>
      The above studies led to the cultivation of the same kind of
      microorganisms from other animal tumors. These invariably grew and
      appeared similar to the Rous and human strains. Sometimes there
      were differences in size or different sugar or oxygen requirements
      for cultivation, but essentially they were the same basic type or
      organism.<br>
      <br>
      The cancer organisms (cryptocides) appear to resemble mycoplasma,
      organisms that exist without cell walls, expecially since the
      cytosinguanine ratio of their mucleic acid, DNA, is similar to
      that of certain mycoplasma. However, the usual mycoplasma tend to
      remain in their state of existence without cell wals but the
      Cryptocides may pass rapidly through the stage without walls to
      the form of true bacteria. Perhaps all mycoplasma could be induced
      to become bacteria but this is still a disputed point.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Robert Huebner, head of the National Institute of Allergy and
      Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Md., has stated that cancer is a
      viral infection. Of the various agents suspected, he stated that
      the C-particle is the most likely agent. It has been called by
      this name because the round bodies found in cancerous tissues
      often appear in a C shape. However, the comparison of the
      C-particles in mouse leukemia with the filted Cryptocides isolates
      examined under the electron microscope show them to be similar in
      size and shape. In preparations from cultures the round forms are
      often seen to split and assume the C form. It would seem that this
      splitting into a C is characteristic, but not necessarily a method
      of identification. All the other methods are necessary as well.<br>
      <br>
      The cancerous growth itself is not the entire disease. The small
      coccuslike granules which can be seen dividing in cancer cells
      represent the intracellular parasite that is the causative agent.
      The parasite within the cancer transforms the normal cell into a
      sick cell that cannot mature by differentiation. It is the
      filtered material from tumors and other cancerous growths, as well
      as the cells themselves, which transmit cancer from one species to
      another species. Or, in other words, the cancerous agent can cross
      species barriers and infect other species.<br>
      <br>
      P. Cryptocides not only causes cancer but a number of other
      ailments that effect man. The infectious nature of arthritis, of
      some kinds of heart, liver and kidney impairment, and most
      recently of diabetes is known. The patterns of these diseases
      point to their latent infectious nature. Cryptocides is an
      infectious agent. But, the tumors are only a part of the resultant
      disease. In addition to tumors, there are cheesy lesions or areas
      resembling tuberculosis, which can involve any one of the
      essential organs such as the liver, kidney heart or lung. These
      organs might show changes in the connective tissue, called
      collagen, which can lead to degeneration as seen in the chronic
      human degenerative diseases. The organism may assume a latent form
      and be inactive as long as the body's defense mechanisms are
      adequate, but when they are not, disease results. The exact kind
      of disease depends on the age of the host and its state of
      resistance, as well as the strain of the organism.<br>
      <br>
      All cancerous bloods examined have revealed the cryptocides
      organisms. Applicants have made a film of untreated blood from a
      terminal cancer patient in which the parasites are seen in
      Brownian motion in the red cells. The parasites stay inside the
      cells of patients who are holding their own against the disease,
      but in advanced cases, the numerous cells rupture, releasing the
      organisms.<br>
      <br>
      The microorganism is apparently ubiquitous in nature, existing in
      a reservoir in soil and water, and is found in all classes of
      animals, including man. It can exist as a latent infection in host
      tissue without causing apparent ill effects. However, when the
      immunologic barriers are lowered it can invade the host in
      prodigious numbers and involve any or all of the host tissues,
      causing various kinds and degrees of pathologic change
      equilibrated between the ferocity and numbers of the invader and
      the ability of the host to resist them. Not only is the organism
      pleomorphic but the pathologic changes induced in experimental
      animals show varying degrees of disease ranging from the lethal
      through the semi-immune, neoplastic and degenerative stages.
      Hyper-immune and degenerative stages may be relatively quiescent
      but can become slowly and progressively fatal.<br>
      <br>
      Man and/or animal can be a latent carrier of the Cryptocides. Many
      of applicants' experimental animals that have surived cancer have
      developed interstitial collagen disease as a result of their
      inoculations with applicants' bacterial isolates of Cryptocides,
      and also developed heart lesions. When baby mice born of infected
      mothers died, the autopsy showed destruction of heart muscle.
      These lesions contained the acid-fast organisms (Cryptocides) in
      the heart muscle. Also, a number of research people in England
      have reported strange microbic bodies previously unrecognized in
      the hearts of people who died of coronary disease. One of the
      applicants had cancer of the forehead treated successfully with
      radium fifteen years previously, but was a latent carrier of the
      Cryptocides. That applicant was treated after that period of time
      with an autogenous vaccine, has had a new vaccine prepared every
      year, and has continued treatment.<br>
      <br>
      "Mycobacterial Forms in Myocardial Vascular Disease", Virginia
      Wuerthele-Caspe Livingston and Eleanor Alexander-Jackson, (1965)
      proposes the theory that there are microbic bodies in the lesions
      of heart diseases and that they are especially numerous in the
      areas where the blood vessels have ruptured. Until recently the
      theory has been the coronary blood vessels of the heart are
      narrowed due to arteriosclerosis, and that fatty deposit in the
      wall of the vessels, and overweight are the determining factors in
      this type of heart disease. Now the medical researchers are
      becoming aware of the fact that the blood bessels themselves are
      often not involved so much as the supporting tissues and muscles
      of the heart so that the heart vessels rupture due to extrinsic
      factors outside the vessel rather than from intrinsic disease.
      This is particularily true of patients with collagen diseases such
      as scleroderma and lupus erythematosis. Vascular and myocardial
      pathology is related to chronic low-grade infection by the
      mycobacterium-like organisms (Cryptocides).<br>
      <br>
      Degenerative changes occur in coronary heart disease in the
      presence of the invasive mycobacterial parasite cryptocides.<br>
      <br>
      Postmorten heart sections of 6 patients with coronary and aortic
      disease were stained by the Fite modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen
      technique (for demonstrating Lepra bacilli in sections) using
      Kinyoun's carbon-fuchsin, and compared with sections of the same
      involved areas stained with conventional H and E. Eight
      predominant types of lesions were observed in the myocardium<br>
      <br>
      1. PERIVASCULAR CHANGES AROUND THE SMALL CORONARY VESSELS. In the
      loose connective tissues numerous small acid-fast bodies can be
      seen.<br>
      <br>
      2. CELLULAR INFILTRATION. This is frequently seen not only around
      the vessels but between the muscle fibers as well. These cells
      consists almost entirely of mononuclear types, predominantly
      lymphocytes, while large mononuclear phagocytes laden with
      organisms plasma and other mononuclear cells are present in
      relatively large number.<br>
      <br>
      3. FIBROBLASTIC INFILTRATION. The presence of these organisms
      appears to stimulate the formation of fibroblasts. In some areas,
      the muscle fibers and interstitial tissues appear to be replaced
      by fibroblasts.<br>
      <br>
      4. INFARCTION. Where there has been an infarct, there may be a
      softened central area with numerous small acid-fast cocci and
      coccobacilli present in the collagenous hemorrhagic softened area.
      5. NECROSIS. Necrotic changes may involve the blood vessels.
      Striking degenerative changes of the vessel walls are observed as
      illustrated not only by the sections of coronary vessels but also
      by the sections of in involved aorta. Proliferative changes may
      involve the endothelium, with invasion of the endothelial cells,
      and are accompanied by thickening and narrowing of the wall.
      Hairlike filaments of the organisms were seen protruding into the
      lumen. These changes are also present in the vasa vasorum of the
      aorta.<br>
      <br>
      6. THROMBOSIS AND RECANALIZATION. Some areas of recanalization
      were observed in heart, liver, and spleen.<br>
      <br>
      7. CHANGES IN THE ELASTIC LAYER OF THE AORTA. The elastic fibrils
      have lost their identity and have become collagenized with loss of
      structure. As scar tissue forms, cholesterol-like plaques occur.
      It seems possible that deposity may be derived in part from the
      fatty envelopes of these organisms. In other tissue where masses
      of the organisms have proliferated, polyhedral crystals resembling
      cholesterol have been observed.<br>
      <br>
      8. CHANGES IN THE HEART MUSCLE. Individual nuclei of the heart
      muscle are frequently parasitized, and replaced by small acid-fast
      globoidal bodies. The muscle fibers themselves appear in a state
      of gradual digestion and disintegration by both minute and larger
      acid-fast forms.<br>
      <br>
      All of the above can be treated and detected by this invention<br>
      <br>
      Neoplastic changes have been shown by Diller and Diller
      (Intracellular acid-fast organisms isolated from malignant
      tissues, Trans. Amer. Micr. Soc., 84:138-148, 1965), to arise in
      tissue culture as the result of exposure to this specific invading
      microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      The Journal of the American Medical Association, July 28, 1969
      Vol. 209, No. 4, contains a summary of the work of K. A. Bisset,
      New Scientist, June 12, 1969, who speculates that many diseases
      like leukemia and arthritis could be caused by Mycoplasma or by
      forms of this elusive bacteria and wrote that the fact that
      mycoplasm can break down into viruslike particles, easily
      identifiable on electron-microscope examination and similar to
      those found in blood of leukemia patients, leads to a strong
      suspicion that Mycoplasma may be a culprit in the development of
      certain malignant processes.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Florence B. Seibert, Veterans Administration Research
      Laboratory at Bay Pines, Fla., has reported immunologic studies
      with the organisms. Labeled antiglobulin, which was specific for
      an isolate from a human breast, adenocarcinoma induced specific
      fluorescence in the white blood cells of patients with leukemia
      and myeloma, demonstrating an immunologic relationship.<br>
      <br>
      Koch's law is the foolproof method of proving the cause of a
      disease. It is as follows:<br>
      1. The microorganism must be present in every case of the disease.<br>
      2. It must be possible to cultivate the microorganism outside the
      host in some artifical media.<br>
      3. The inoculation of this culture must produce the disease in a
      susceptible animal.<br>
      4. The microorganism must then be reobtained from these inoculated
      animals and cultured again.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants have fulfilled Koch's law using pure, uncontaminated
      cultures of cryptocides. Pure cultures were obtained repeatedly
      from the various proliferative and neoplastic diseases of both men
      and animals. Then they were injected into animals capable of being
      infected. Gradually diseased areas developed which resembled those
      from which the cultures were obtained. Then the pure cultures were
      reisolated from the infected animals. Thus Koch's postulates were
      fulfilled.<br>
      <br>
      A blood specimen of a terminal cancer patient was cultured, the
      culture was extracted and the extract produced tumors in mice.
      This demonstrates the growth factors.<br>
      <br>
      In one attempt to produce antibodies and antiserum in sheep that
      would be beneficial in the treatment of human cancer, sheep were
      immunized with an attenuated or weakened culture. Twenty sheep
      were examined and found to be free of disease. Some of the stock
      cultures applicants had on hand such as cultures from human breast
      cancer, from a sarcoma of a young boy, from a human leukemia, from
      the Rous chicken tumor, from arthritis, and from fowl leukosis,
      were attenuated. Applicants injected two sheep with each strain.
      After about four weeks, some of the sheep became sick. Attenuated
      vaccines from the cancer cultures were used weekly for
      immunization. Several ewes aborted their young. The fetuses were
      macerated. Some of the sheep developed very swollen painful joints
      and could scarcely graze. Others looked poorly because emaciated.
      Applicants realized that the vaccines which were attenuated were
      still alive and had not fully immunized the sheep but had diseased
      them. The sheep were bled in order to assay their serum for
      antibodies. Sera was obtained but the sheep had to be destroyed.
      Although the sheep had to be destroyed applicants learned that the
      fowl leukosis serum agglutinated in high dilution the cultures
      from the boy's sarcoma, that the breast cancer serum reacted with
      the human leukemia isolates, and that the Rous sarcoma serum
      reacted with all of the cultures. This meant that the cultures
      from the human cross-reacted with one another strongly and with
      the animal sera, showing that tumors are not tissue or species
      specific.<br>
      <br>
      Three chickens having fowl leukosos, a cancerous disease, and
      which could no longer stand up, were taken to applicants'
      laboratory and in a short time they were dead. Applicants made
      cultures from their heart's blood. These grew to be the same kind
      of cultures as those derived from all of the other tumors
      experimented with by the applicants.<br>
      <br>
      A pure, selectively grown bacterial culture of the type described
      above, obtained from urine and blood using sterile precautions,
      contains chemical substances related and/or identical to the
      actinomycin group. To test this point, a phenolized pure culture
      was acidified with HCl to pH 2 (Congo red/thymol blue) and was
      left standing overnight after short boiling. A mixture of
      n-butanol/conc. NaCl, equal parts by volume, containing a few
      drops of glacial acetic acid, was used for extraction. After
      gentle shaking for about 15 minutes a dark cherry-red layer of the
      solvent was separated for further processing. This crude mixture
      gave peak absorption at 440/450 mn and 410/425 mn values which
      compare favorably except for a third absorption peak at 240 m.mu.
      obtained by Waksman (Waksman, S. A., and Lechevalier, H. A.: The
      Actinomycetes, vol. III, The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co.,
      Baltimore, 1962, p. 168) which was missing. From an ascending
      paper chromatogram a reddish zone was eluted with ethylacetate and
      an acetone-ether mixture, both gave upon evaporation some
      microscopic crystals (red plates). The controls containing broth
      and 2% phenol but no organism gave upon extraction a barely
      yellow-tinted layer of the solvent. This exploratory separation
      technique was then repeated with several 25-hour urine specimens
      obtained from terminal cancer patients. After separation of the
      organic layer from the urine specimens again a more or less
      pronounced color was present ranging from dark honey-brown to
      cherry red; controls taken from healthy persons did not contain
      such colors. The presence of these dark colored compounds seems to
      be most pronounced in terminal cases. All crude mixtures isolated
      from cultures and/or urine were subjected to further separation by
      chromatographic techniques.<br>

      Isolation from Urine (Crofton Method)<br>
      <br>
      Obtain a midstream clean-catch specimen of urine in a sterlized
      screw-top glass container.<br>
      <br>
      Make up DiFco's brain-heart infusion agar: 37 grams of the agar
      base are added to a liter of distilled water, heated to melt and
      mix, and distributed into flasks or bottles of 95 ml amounts, and
      autoclaved. Five percent (5%) human blood (outdated bloodbank
      blood may be used) is added when the melted agar has cooled down
      to 45-50 degrees C., and the mixture is poured into sterile Petri
      dishes.<br>
      <br>
      Streak the surface of the blood agar plate with a sterile swab
      which has been dipped in the urine. Incubate plate to 37 degrees
      C. and examine after 24 hours. If growth has appeared, note types
      of colonies, make duplicate smears, and stain one by Gram's stain
      and the other by Alexander-Jackson's modified Ziehl-Neelsen
      technique: flood side with Kinyoun's carbolfuchsin for 3 to 5
      minutes in the cold, wash, decolorize briefly with 70% alcohol
      containing 1 to 3% HCl as these organisms decolorize more readily
      that M. tuberculosis, counter stain by flooding slide with
      Loeffler's methylene blue and add 6 to 8 drops of normal (4%)
      sodium hydroxide. Tilt slide to mix, and wash after 30 seconds.<br>

      <b>APPEARANCE OF THE MICROORGANISMS ON BLOOD AGAR</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Colonies--usual types of growth obtained<br>
      <br>
      1. white discoidal, often hemolytic, and with a raised
      center--having a fried egg appearance, but usually larger than
      classic PPLO colonies grown on PPLO agar.<br>
      <br>
      2. grayish muccoid, often confluent.<br>
      <br>
      3. pigmented: yellowish, occasionally pinkish coral.<br>
      <br>
      4. wrinkled intermediate SR worm-casting type resembling M.
      tuberculosis colony.<br>
      <br>
      5. dull granular surfaced, irregular edges, often hemolytic, and
      resembling B. subtilis, but virulent for mice. Motile forms
      transferred tp A-J broth produce a white or grayish white soft rim
      or pellicle, and a toxin-like substance.<br>
      <br>
      This organism tends to resist emulsification to some degree when a
      loop of culture is rubbed with a drop of water on a glass slide to
      make a smear.<br>
      <br>
      <b>MICROSCOPIC APPEARANCE</b><br>
      <br>
      The cancer isolate is either Gram positive or Gram variable. The
      Gram stain is not the stain of choice, but should be used to
      eliminate true Gram negative organisms, which show no Gram
      positivity at all such as B. coli, proteus or pseudomonas.<br>
      <br>
      Acid-fast forms may or may not be found, as this organism is
      intermittently acid-fast rather than more consistently so as in M.
      tuberculosis or other classic mycobacteria. However, if possible,
      careful search for acid-fast forms is desirable, as they are
      hallmarks of this mycobacterium-like organism. Slender filaments,
      sometimes with lateral branching, and sometimes acid-fast, help to
      distinguish it from common micrococci. The rods may be slender and
      diphtheroidal, or thicker and subtillis-like. The latter sometimes
      contain tiny brightly acid-fast bodies surrounded by a colorless
      vacuole-like area or capsule. This appearance plus virulence for
      mice and guinea-pigs distinguish them from subtillis rods. The
      main morphologic forms are:<br>
      <br>
      1. tiny acid-fast elementary-type bodies, often refractile;<br>
      <br>
      2. Coccoidal forms of varying sizes with or without threads or
      protruding filaments;<br>
      <br>
      3. rods as described above; X, Y, and V forms commonly seen,
      filaments may become very long and wide;<br>
      <br>
      4. cyst-like bodies of various sizes from 3 to more than 10.mu.
      and often containing smaller bodies which may be brightly
      acid-fast;<br>
      <br>
      5. L or PPLO forms consisting of a lightly stained matrix
      containing more deeply stained bodies of various sizes, or tangled
      branching threads and ring-forms. These are revealed by
      Alexander-Jackson's Triple Stain modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen
      technique;<br>
      <br>
      6. spore forms of oval shape seen in old cultures;<br>

      microscope, and of virus size.<br>

      (e) a brownish, foul aromatic residue.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CHROMATOGRAPHIC IDENTIFICATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To an acidfied (pH 5) sample of urine in which the organisms are
      grown, (phase I) and kept in the refrigerator, is added one-fourth
      volume of n-butyl alcohol and the mixture is shaken for one-half
      hour. The mixture is refrigerated until the layers separate.
      Separation is done by decantation first and then by using a
      separatory funnel. The butanol layer has attained a reddish brown
      color and in some cases a yellowish color. This procedure results
      in an aqueous phase (II) and a butanol phase (III). The aqueous
      phase is extracted once or twice more in the same manner with
      n-butanol, so long as the color appears in the extract.<br>
      <br>
      A portion of the combined extracts is evaporated in an evaporator
      at 35 DEG-40 DEG C. The dried residue is dissolved in a small
      amount of methyl alcohol, solution (IV). Layers of a silica gel
      preparation, MM-SGel-HR for thin layer chromatography, Machorey
      Nagel and Co. 516 Durem, Germany, is spread on glass plated,
      prepared, dried and stored in a dessicator. By means of a small
      pipette, a spot of solution (IV) is placed on the silica gel layer
      of one of these plates near one edge and near this spot at the
      same distance from this edge and in the same way, another spot of
      actinomycin D, (Merck, Sharp and Dohme), is placed in the same
      manner. Both spots appeared bright yellow. Other pairs of spots of
      these two solutions are placed on the same row using 5 m.mu., 10
      m.mu. and 15 m.mu.. (One m.mu. equals one microliter.) Of the
      solvents tried for developing the chromatograph, the most
      effective was butanol-methanol-water in the ratios of volume of
      6:1:3. 60 ml. of butanol, 10 ml methanol and 30 ml of distilled
      water are mixed and put into a thin layer chromatography chamber.
      The paper lining the walls of the chamber is wet by swirling the
      solution in the chamber. Then the plate with the spots is placed
      on edge in the chamber with the row of spots parallel to and near
      the bottom but above the surface of the solution. A cover is
      placed over the top of the chamber sealing it. The chamber is kept
      in the dark during the process of separation since a better yield
      elution is obtained. In previous runs each actinomycin D spot
      travelled as a single spot leaving nothing in the pathway by
      visible or ultraviolet light, and phase (III) left material spread
      from the top streaking down along the pathways. However the top
      was always at a level with and the same color as the actinomycin
      D. Subsequently, after drying the plates, the actinomycin D spots
      and those portions from the spots of phase (III) on a level with
      the actinomycin D spots are cut out and separately eluted with
      methanol, as are other portions from the spots of phase (III),
      since these may contain other actinomycins than actinomycin D.
      Visible ultraviolet and infrared absorption spectrograms are made
      of the different elutes and compared. The TLC method is based and
      adapted from methods reported by Cassani et al, J. Chrom. v. 13,
      1964, 238-239.<br>

      <b>ACTINOMYCIN BIO-ASSAY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Blood and tissue cultures and urine samples obtained in accordance
      with the foregoing procedures were extracted with and equal volume
      of butanol, water, acetic acid (4:5:1) and the upper phase taken
      to dryness. The residues were taken up into two 5 ml. portions of
      ether and evaporated at 35 DEG-40 DEG C. Paper discs were dipped
      into ether solutions of extract, the ether evaporated and the
      discs placed on standard actinomycin assay plates. A standard
      preparation of actinomycin D was also run. The zones of inhibition
      are shown in Table I; zones above 15 mm. in diameter fall within
      the standard range and are calculated in terms of actinomycin D

      <b>UV ABSORPTION CURVES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      0.2 ml. of each ether solution was evaporated to dryness and the
      residue taken up in 1 ml. of methanol and UV absorption curves
      were recorded. End absorption at this level of purity prevented
      measurement of 440 mm. absorption. Small peaks, typical of trace
      amounts of actinomycin, were found with samples 1-6 inclusive and
      sample 8 with a slight response present with sample 17. Definitive
      biochemical tests such as the cytosine-guanine percentage of the
      DNA have helped to classify the cryptocides microbial isolates.<br>
      <br>
      Further concerning cryptocides, these organisms, which appear
      primarily as small acid-fast granules in young cultures, and which
      tend to become non-acid-fast in the larger forms present in older
      cultures, may exhibit a number of morphologic phases with
      intermediate transitional forms. These include (1) filterable and
      submicroscopic bodies; (2) larger granules readily visible under
      the light microscope an often resembling ordinary micrococci; (3)
      larger globidal cystlike bodies and thin-walled sacs containing
      the smaller forms; (4) PPLO or L type zoogleal symplasms without
      cell walls; (5) rods of various sizes capable of developing a
      characteristic motility; (6) long filaments and threads which may
      show lateral branching; and (7) thick-walled spore-like bodies.
      The lesions produced by these organisms in experimental animals
      were generally pseudocaseous, degenerative in type, occasionally
      neoplastic, and occurred principally in the liver, kidneys, and
      lungs although at times, there was involvement of the heart,
      spleen adrenal glands, stomach, lymph nodes, and omentum.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Afton Munk Livingston, and Dr. Virginia Livingston,
      Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences, May 1972, report
      the recognition of the P. cryptocides organisms in the blood of
      cancer patients compared with the blood of healthy individuals, of
      which a summary follows. Examinations by darkfield microscope of
      fresh blood, and also by brightfield microscope using supravital
      stains serving as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in following
      the course of the cancerous disease in the patient in conjunction
      with several other microbiological evaluations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PREPARATION OF SLIDES FOR BLOOD EXAMINATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The patient's finger is immersed in 70 percent alcohol and air
      dried. A steril lancet is used to puncture the finger, a small
      drop of free-flowing blood is placed on a sterile clean slide and
      covered with a sterile covership. Care is taken that the blood
      does not flow beyond the edge of the coverslip. Using a small
      weight for approximately one minute, light pressure is applied to
      the coverslip to spread and separate the blood cells. The
      preparation is then examined under darkfield at .times.750 and
      .times.1350 magnification. For lightfield examination, the same
      method is followed and in addition, a small drop of 1 percent
      aqueous sterile crystal violet, freshly prepared and filtered,
      gently applied to the preparation. If the number of organisms, to
      the blood as well as the motility of the various stages are to be
      evaluted, then the blood is diluted 1:100 with sterile distilled
      water using a sterile red-blood-cell diluting pipette. The pipette
      is then thoroughly shaken and a few drops are expelled from the
      pipette into a sterile Petri dish. A small measured amount of 1
      percent aqueous crystal violet is added. This mixture may then be
      used to flood a blood counting chamber. This method provides a
      quantitative estimate of the numbers of the organism as well as
      their motility, which may last as long as fifteen minutes.
      However, for the usual brightfield examination of the blood with
      crystal violet, the blood drop is placed directly by the slide and
      the small amounts of crystal violet is added before the coverslip
      is placed over the preparation and light pressure applied.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DARKFIELD EXAMINATION OF UNSTAINED FRESH BLOOD PREPARATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A number of interesting observations may now be made by the
      darkfield, pulsating orange bodies in the red cells may be
      observed. In the background, there are bright dancing forms which
      appear to be small L-forms of the organism. In several infected
      hosts a number of motile rods may be observed. Spheroplasts and
      mesosomes both large and small are present. These may have many
      fine delicate vibrating forms in their periphery. Forms resembling
      a medusa or a octopus with waving filaments may be present.
      Organisms may bud from the surface of the red cells and from fine
      hairlike filaments which resemble the handle of a tennis racquet.
      There may also be numerous threadlike filaments free in the serum,
      varying in size, some 10-15 microns in length. These are motile
      and appear to wind in and out around the red cells. There are also
      long tubular structures 50 microns or more in length, and about 10
      microns in width that are milky white, highly luminescent,
      containing numerous refractile granules. The tube in some cases
      appears to arise from a coalescence of the L-forms or to bud from
      a spheroplast. It is transparent since cells can be seen through
      it. When the tube wall disintegrates the refractile bodies are
      released in the serum and may enter fresh red cells. There are
      also large round milky white forms appearing to be protoplasts
      about 20 to 60 microns in diameter which contain granules
      resembling spheroplasts or mesosomes. The protoplasts may have
      budding forms at the periphery and may release rather large
      vesicular refractile bodies resembling the spheroplasts or
      mesosomes. At times, the extruded mesosomes are large enough to be
      mistaken for red blood cells, but they do not have the bluish
      tinge of red cells seen in darkfield. Rather, minute dancing
      particles may later appear within them.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, shrunked red cells with a ground-glass appearance
      spiculated at the periphery may be observed. We have termed these
      structures "spent cells" since they appear to be red cells that
      have been consumed by the parasites. They are lighter and smaller
      than normal erythocytes and have a tendency to be pushed to the
      periphery of the blood drop when it is prepared for examination.
      Changes in the character of the leukocytes are also apparent. Many
      leukocytes in the advanced stages of diseases appear smudged,
      inactive and only dimly luminescent whereas normal leukocytes have
      vigorously active granules and active amoeboid movements. Under
      some circumstances great numbers of fine spicules occur in the
      dark field. These are very delicate and appear to arise from
      minute L-forms. They are not thrombocytes. At times they appear to
      shed from the surface of the protoplasts. Why they should be more
      numerous at one time than at another is not understood but their
      appearance may be related to the pH of the blood. Orange
      crystalline forms of the organisms as well as free crystals may
      also be seen in and around the microbial clusters in the plasma.
      They apparently arise from the waxy-secretions of these
      mycobacteriumlike organisms. These are the crystals that have been
      extracted from pure cultures and urines of terminal cancer
      patients and that have been used for various types of bioassay.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIGHTFIELD EXAMINATION OF SUPRAVITALLY STAINED FRESH BLOOD
        PREPARATIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      On a blood preparation stained with crystal violet and examined by
      the brightfield method a clear white light and a magnification of
      at least .times.1000 microbial forms are revealed that are not
      seen in the darkfield. There are large branching fungal forms that
      are not luminescent in the darkfield. These fungal forms may
      extend over a considerable area involving several microscopic
      fields. Some of these are branching and appear to have conidial or
      frutting bodies attached to their branches. Microcolonies may be
      clearly seen surrounding individual red cells and some appear to
      arise from parasites extruded from the cells. These microcolonies
      appear to develop into a network of interlacing branching fungal
      filaments which act as bridges between the red cells and cause
      them to adhere in clumps. The number of fungal forms which hold
      the erythrocytes together or adhere to their surfaces may be
      directly related to the sedimentation rate. The greater the
      adherence of the erythrocytes due to the mycelial forms, the more
      rapid the sedimentation rate. The red cells become separate and
      free as the number of both intra-and extracellular parasites
      diminish. The stained preparations in the counting chamber have
      L-forms, which appear much more numerous than in the darkfield,
      and occur in clusters, which have marked Brownian movement. These
      clusters agglutinate and become motionless after ten to fifteen
      minutes. Introduction of gamma globulin or specific antiserum
      under the coverslip of the counting chamber caused instant
      agglutination and cessation of motion. By this method, antibody
      activity of blood serum can be roughly estimated. Other dyed
      microbial forms in the brightfield may be compared with those in
      the darkfield. The vibrating orange bodies in erythrocytes in the
      darkfield appear as violet bodies in lightfield. The brightly
      luminous tubles take on a light violet color with deep purple
      granules.<br>
      <br>
      The same comparison between darkfield and stained brightfield
      preparations may be drawn by examining blood cultures grown in
      broth. Hanging drops of cultures sealed with sterile vaseline are
      preferable to ordinary wet perparations since they are safer to
      handle and can be preserved for a longer period of time.
      Conventional staining of slide preparations appears to break up
      many of the delicate microcolonies and interlacing fungal forms.
      Wet supravitally stained preparations in hanging drops also
      indicate the degree of motility of many of the microorganisms.
      Other dyes have been used which penetrate to some extent but do
      not provide sufficient contrast. They are Sudan black, saffron
      yellow, Congo red, May Grunwald, toluidine blue, gentian violet,
      as well as several others.<br>
      <br>
      All cancerous patients yielded L-forms as well as other
      pleomorphic stageson blood culture which, on further cultivation,
      developed the typical acid-fastness of the Progenitor cryptocides
      group as previously described. However, the cancer patient even in
      the advanced stages of the disease is usually afebrile. Comparable
      numbers of microorganisms other than the Progenitor cryptocides
      groups might be expected to produce an acute febrile reaction.
      There undoubtedly can be a mild or transitory bacteremia in blood
      due to relatively nonpathogenic bacteria such as some of the
      diphtheroids. However, with the previously described methods, the
      great numbers of the Progenitor group as a silent but lethal
      bloodstream infection may be readily demonstrated. Advancing
      infection of the bloodstream with P. cryptocides is relatively
      asymptomatic until large numbers of the organisms are present and
      there is a concomitant breakdown of the immunological and
      dextoxifying system.<br>
      <br>
      The autogeneous vaccine is known to exist by disc-saturated
      inhibition on culture plates of extracts and also from the serum
      of cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      Administration of the autogenous vaccine should be initiated by
      high dilutions of the lowest order of dosage at twice weekly
      intervals, with gradually increasing dosages until overdosage
      symptoms occur. Preferably, subcutaneous injection of the
      autogenous vaccine in a suitable pharmaceutical carrier, such as
      sterile water or saline solution may be employed, although oral
      administration of the product in a suitable carrier also may be
      employed.<br>
      <br>
      Use of the autogenous vaccine of this invention may prove to be of
      value in the palliative treatment of animals and humans afflicted
      with various forms of neoplastic diseases, as indicated by
      treatment thereof with autogeneous vaccines made from a suspension
      of the isolates in 2% phenol. In preparation, the vaccine is
      allowed to stand overnight at room temperatures, centrifuged and
      further diluted with 0.5 phenol or saline.<br>
      <br>
      Subcutaneous injection is initiated with the highest dilution of 1
      million organisms per ml and 0.1 ml twice weekly, until overdosage
      symptoms occur. Therapy is continued with higher concentrations,
      e.g., 10 million and 100 million organisms/ml. Oral administration
      of the same dosage can also be employed.<br>
      <br>
      A study of one hundred random blood samples, taken in the office
      of a physician who specialized in allergy and immunologic disease,
      showed that all tumor-bearing patients, in comparison to office
      personnel used as controls, gave positive cultures for the
      cryptocides organism. A number of patients with chronic
      degenerative disease were also positive. While many patients who
      had reached a healthy old age were negative, several "tired" young
      people without apparent disease were positive.<br>
      <br>
      A reddish brown material has been extracted from the tissue, urine
      and blood of cancer patients in increasing amounts as they became
      terminally ill, and (this material has not been found in normal
      controls. It is carcinogenic for mice, increasing the incidence of
      pulmonary tumors. The biological effects have been assayed in
      preliminary studies with tissue-culture systems and with
      tumor-genesis in mice.<br>
      <br>
      The applicants have found the presence of actinomycin-like
      crystals in body tissues and in cultures.<br>
      <br>
      The basic requirement for formation of the cancer cell is the
      causative microorganism; all other factors such as coal-tar
      irritants, other microorganisms, the aging process, any chronic
      irritants leading to poor local resistance and giving rise to
      immature, succeptible reparative cells, may prepare the living
      matter, e.g., for the multiplication of the cancer organism and
      its penetration into the cyptoplasm and nucleus of the host cell.<br>
      <br>
      Apparently the organism cryptocides can invade both cytoplasm and
      nucleus of host cells in any type of host tissue when body
      defenses are lowered. In experimental animals it can cause lesions
      that appear as necrotic abscesses, granulomas, fluid-filled cysts
      of neoplasms. The type of lesion apparently depends on specific
      and nonspecific immunocompetence and the age of the host.<br>
      <br>
      Certain chemicals can have a tremendous effect upon the entire
      hormonal system. One of these substances is actinomycin produced
      by several of the actinomyces organisms and probably by many of
      the Actinomycetales. There is a whole array of chemicals and
      biologic produced by this group of microbes, which have been used
      as antibiotics and antineoplastic agents in some cases. The
      actinomycins even in very high dilution of one part in a billion
      or more may have a profound effect upon the entire business of
      life. The important thing to remember is that no funtcion of the
      body is exempt from this toxic material which is produced by these
      microorganisms belonging to the Actinomycetales. Not only are the
      normal functions of the host's hormonal system deranged but there
      are "false or counterfeit hormones" produced with further throw
      the body off balance. There is a practice of castrating men and
      women to arrest the growth of cancer. If castration is successful
      in prolonging life, then adrenalectomy and pituary gland removal
      might be done when the effects of tumor inhibition from the
      castration have worn off. This hormonal ablation presents a grim
      picture to say the least. Applicants believe that the hormonal
      stimulation of the sex glands, the adrenals and the pituitary are
      the result of toxic materials, hormonal derangers and counterfeit
      hormones, such as, phytosterols produced by the Cyptocides, that
      upset the balance of the patient's hormones not only by inhibitory
      effects by production of pseudo or counterfeit hormones that act
      on the physiologically controlled, normal glands causing abnormal
      response. Also various kinds of cell poisons and inhibitors
      destroy the efficacy of the lymphocytes to attack the cancer
      cells. The cancer cells themselves are prevented from reaching
      maturation by these cell poisons They are sick cells unable to
      reach a normal maturity and normal function, whereever they are
      located and whatever tissue they may be whether glandular,
      interstital, bone or blood.<br>
      <br>
      The most important thing is to try to destroy the microbes that
      were producing the aberrant cell inhibitors and false hormones.
      However, it has been reported that low testosterone levels have
      been induced in patients with cancer of the prostate by treatment
      with diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic hormone; and
      amino-glutethimide, a powerful inhibitor of adrenal corticosteroid
      biosynthesis, with patient improvement. Furthermore, an
      immunological mechanism appears to be involved; the inhibition of
      steroid biosynthesis. By removing the lympholytic effect of
      corticosteroids, there is produced a marked hyperplasia and
      increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes which potentiate
      the immune response. The presence of lymphocytotoxic antibodies
      has been reported in patients with prostatic cancer. Perhaps this
      steroid is a "false steroid" and antagonism by the
      amino-glutethimidine and diethylstilbestrol may permit an increase
      in the production and circulation of normal lymphocytes capable of
      attacking the cancer cells.<br>
      <br>
      The role of steroids in chronic diseases was demonstrated by
      Edward Kendall and Philipp Hench in their studies in rheumatology
      for which they received the Nobel Prize in 1950. It is true that
      the steroids do not have an inhibitory effect on these diseases
      but at the expense of suppressing immunity and permitting the
      underlying latent infection to continue or to increase in its
      growth potential.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that a bacterium belonging to the Actinomycetales was
      able to produce unlimited amounts of steroids from the Mexican
      yam.<br>
      <br>
      It is stated that some steroids decrease the numbers of
      circulating lymphocytes as well as blocking immunocompetence.
      Perhaps the "false steroids" are really responsible for this
      action. It has been shown that certain toxic antigens prevent the
      lymphocyte from maturing and become immunocompetent. Leukemia, or
      an accumulation of large numbers of cells, either lymphocytes or
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes, may represent a blocking of the
      pathway to maturity by a toxic agent such as a steroidal or
      actinomycinlike compound produced by the cryptocides. Perhaps the
      blocking factor may be related to a protective mechanism directed
      toward making the cryptocides insusceptible through some
      biochemical fraction that blocks the immune reaction of the
      lymphocyte.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is useful in the treatment of man and/or
      animal. Safety and effectiveness of the present invention has been
      demonstrated in animals and has been indicated in the treatment of
      humans by administration of the aforesaid vaccine form.<br>
      <br>
      Among the various neoplastic diseases (often termed diseases of
      unknown etiology) subject to palliative treatment are cancer,
      tumor of the lymphoid tissues, Hodgkin's disease,
      reticulo-endothelial tissues, arthritis, lymphosarcoma, the broad
      spectrum of epidermoid cancer, scleroderma, adenocarcinoma,
      fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, myosarcoma, acute glomerulonephritis,
      leimoya sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chondro sarcoma, myeloma,
      rous chicken sarcoma, coal-tar-induced cancer, fowl leukosis,
      animal tumors such as Rous, Walker, Sprague-Dawley, Shope and
      Sarcoma 180, and the like. Many of the foregoing are degenerative
      and antoimmune diseases.<br>
      <br>
      Malignancy is a neoplastic infection, which depends on the number
      and virulence of the invading organism, the susceptibility of
      various organs to it, as well as the natural immunologic
      components of the host.<br>
      <br>
      The reddish-brown crystalline substances extracted from broths
      containing organisms within this invention are antibiotic to the
      bacteria and to all strains of the producing organisms themselves.<br>

      <b>MEDIA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The preferred media for growing cryptocides are obtained with
      Alexander-Jackson's broth, and with Wuerthele-Caspe's autoclaved
      chick embryo agar. The method of preparation of these two media is
      given below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ALEXANDER-JACKSON'S (A-J) SENSITIVE PEPTONE BROTH</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ingredients:<br>
      water (distilled)<br>
      2,000 ml<br>
      beef lung, cut up<br>
      2 pounds<br>
      peptones 20 grams; 5 grams of each of<br>
      (a) myosate, (b) gelysate,<br>
      (c) trypticase, (d) phytone<br>
      glucose 10 grams<br>
      glycerol 80 ml<br>
      <br>
      Boil the beef lung and water for 30 minutes. Filter through cotton
      or very coarse paper into a flask containing the other
      ingredients, and heat to dissolve. This crude lung broth can be
      autoclaved and stored in the icebox, and clarified subsequently.
      Autoclaving for a second time does not seem to produce any adverse
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      Clarification:<br>
      <br>
      A 1 to 2 mm layer of infusorial earth (Standard Filter Cel of
      Johns-Manville Co.) is deposited on a No. 42 Whatman paper disc by
      laying the disc on a Buchner funnel, applying suction, and then
      carefully pouring on about 500 ml of a 5 percent suspension of
      Filter Cel. After the deposition of the layer, when the water goes
      through clear, the suction flask is well rinsed out. The hot
      medium can now be filtered through the prepared disc into the
      flask.<br>
      <br>
      The medium should be filtered a second time through a Buchner-type
      funnel with a fine fritted glass disc, or else passed once more
      through the same Filter Cel.<br>
      <br>
      pH adjustment:<br>
      <br>
      The pH of the medium should be adjusted to 7.4 with sodium
      hydroxide. The medium is then tubed into screw-top glass tubes
      150.times.25 mm (Kimble Glass Co., Toledo, Ohio). The tops of the
      tubes are not screwed tightly until after autoclaving. Autoclave
      for 15 minutes at 15 pounds pressure. Place about 5 ml of medium
      into each tube; or place 50 ml in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask for
      primary isolates. Close the flasks with cotton plugs held in a
      single layer of gauze, and protect the plug by a paper drinking
      cup or cone.<br>
      <br>
      The A-J broth is obtainable from the Colorado Serum Company of
      Denver, Colo.<br>
      <br>
      Whole fresh citrated or untreated blood, 0.2 ml is added to 2 ml
      of broth at pH 7.4, and incubated for a week. A transfer to fresh
      broth is then made to rid the culture of antibodies or other
      inhibitory substances. After several days, the organisms appear as
      a mat at the bottom of the tube. When motile rod forms are
      present, a soft while ring or pellicle appears. Growth is often
      seen climbing up the side of the glass tube.<br>
      <br>
      The peptones included in the above broth have been studied
      individually. Myosate, a pancreatic hydrolysate of heart muscle,
      favors small virus-like and coccoidal forms. Gelysate, a gelatin
      hydrolysate, appears to favor slender acid-fast rods and
      non-acid-fast rods containing acid-fast granules. Phytone a papaic
      digest of soya meal, and trypticase, a pancreatic digest of
      casein, both favor the readily growing motile rods. A combination
      of all four peptones provides a medium which allows a wide variety
      of forms to develop, and makes it easier to recognize the presence
      of the organism in primary isolations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WUERTHELE-CASPE'S CHICK EMBRYO AGAR</b><br>
      <br>
      The contents of 8-15 days old embryonated hens' eggs are ground up
      on a Waring blendor, mixed with 1.5 percent melted agar, tubed in
      screw-top glass tubes, preferably large ones, slanted, an
      autoclaved at 15 pound for 20 minutes in the slanted position.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of other media which can be used are Difco's brain-heart
      broth with and without glycerin, Dubos medium, Alexander-Jackson's
      modification of von Szabocky's glycerol lung broth, dextrose blood
      agar, Alexander-Jackson's adaptation of Bushnell's poi agar,
      Petragnani, Lowenstein-Jensen, Dorset egg media, Witte's peptone,
      Difco's bactopeptone, Armour's peptone, a Merck peptone and
      Fairchild's peptone.<br>
      <br>
      <b>METHODS OF IDENTIFYING CRYPTOCIDES</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention also involves a test that will show the existance
      of a neoplastic disease before the tumor exists, or the existance
      of a chronic underlying infection in man and/or animal. Until now
      any aberrant symptom of a patient has to be evaluated in the light
      of a latent cancer until it was ruled out. A fever of unknown
      origin could turn out to be a sarcoma somewhere in the body made
      manifest weeks later after much laboratory work and X-rays. By
      then, it was already too late, to do anything. Even if it had been
      known that cancer was imminent there was no treatment. There was
      nothing to do but wait until a tumor presented itself and then
      attempt to cut it out or destroy it by radiation or chemicals.
      (Applicants' invention involves a cure for such cancer.)<br>
      <br>
      Tests for determining the presence of cancer such as the Pap
      smears testshave serious problems associated therewith. In the Pap
      smears tests, the body cells that are cast off from the uterus,
      cervix and vagina are smeared from the cervix, are placed on a
      silde and stained. Not only is the presence of cancer cells
      detected but the amount of estrogen in the body is indicated by
      the size and shape of the nucleus of the cell in relation to the
      cytoplasm. This test is useful in determining the stage of
      menopause in women. Unfortunately, when the smear for cancer is
      positive, the cancer is already there. However, it does permit
      early detection of some kinds of cancer of the female reproductive
      organs. The same method of cell determination is now applied to a
      number of other sites such as lung and stomach.<br>
      <br>
      As cancer is an infection, surgery, radiation and chemicals cannot
      eradicate a continuing infectuous process. For example, cobalt
      machines may reduce the size of tumors but contribute very little
      to the long-term cure of the disease.<br>
      <br>
      The test of this invention allows a screening program of the
      entire poputation by means of routine blood cultures to determine
      the presence of the cryptocides bacteria correlated with
      evaluation of blood smears and related to immune competency by
      various methods of antigen-antibody determination.<br>
      <br>
      There are a number of identifying biochemical tests that can be
      applied but these are too time-consuming and expensive for a
      routine laboratory. In the dying patient, a few drops of blood
      taken from the antecubital vein of the arm will grow out furiously
      on direct plating on the solid blood plates. Usually, isolation
      from blood is done by placing ony a few drops of blood, about
      five, in the bottom of a peptone-broth tube, and incubating. The
      organisms can be readily recognized either in hanging drops of the
      living cultures or by appropriate staining. The organisms grow up
      the side of the tube forming a lacy pattern and then produce a
      pellicle or doily on the surface. These usually signify the
      presence of motile rods. This is a good stage from which to make a
      vaccine. As the pellicle ages it has a tendency to drop into the
      tube again the spore stages are then formed. The spores cannot be
      used for vaccines as it is almost impossible to kill them. The
      liquid cultures will often transfer to solid media plates.
      Applicants' sensitive peptone broth for primary isolation is
      useful, and it can be obtained from the Colorado Serum Company in
      Denver, Colo. Dr. Diller's paper gives the various methods of
      isolation using the technique of Von Brehmer, Glover, Seibert and
      others. Applicants have also used synthetic broh media for primary
      isolation but these proved to be too toxic on animal
      experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      There are several other ways of making primary isolations of the
      cryptocides. Sterilely obtained tumor tissue fresh from the
      operating room can be placed into liquid media and later
      transferred to solid blood plates. Some people have ground up the
      tumors, filtered them and then cultured them. This is difficult
      because of the problem of maintaining sterility. These methods led
      to the recovery of the specific microorganism, the cryptocides.
      Still others have made various extractives of the tumors with
      alcohol, acetone or other solvents and used these for the vaccine.
      Another method is to grow the organism from one of its favored
      spots, the roots of infected teeth or tonsils. However, the mouth
      contaminants must be eliminated. Still another way is to dilute
      the patient's blood with equal parts of distilled water in order
      to disrupt the red cells wherein the parasites are contained as
      well as in the serum. The tubes are lightly boiled over an open
      flame two or three times and then incubated for eight to twelve
      days. Intervening examination of the blood will reveal the rate of
      growth. When the growth is abundant, usually in ten to twelve
      days, the blood can be filtered to remove larger particles, then
      formalinized, standardized and tested for viability. This method
      may have some advantages over the whole-cell antigens obtained by
      the Crofton method, because the whole-blood cultures will also
      contain toxins and antitoxins as well as many of the minute forms
      which do not grow out on artificial media. This is the German
      method.<br>
      <br>
      The following is a description of applicants' test method for the
      quick detection of the presence of the chorionic gonadotropic
      hormone (which is produced by cryptocides) in urine which
      indicates the existence of a chronic underlying infection in
      tissue and blood which produces the chorionic gonadotropic
      hormone, thus eliminating the need for study of individual
      colonies. This test can be of great importance to the medical
      profession, particularily in determining the presence of cancer or
      the likelihood of cancer proliferation. The test can be used in
      man and animal.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants theorize that the abnormal production of the steroid
      chorionic gonadotropic hormone, keeps the cancer cells growing.
      Chorionic gonadotropic hormone is made by the microbe Cryptocides.<br>
      <br>
      This tool allows the diagnosis and prognosis of chronic underlying
      infection or condition. Treatment can follow.<br>
      <br>
      Describing the diagnoistic test, the way that applicants have
      found to indicate whether or not choronic gonadotropic hormone is
      present in the urine is: to take a predetermined amount (usually
      10 ml.) from a urine specimen of the person or animal; prepare a
      blood culture using the urine sample; allow the blood culture to
      set (e.g., one day); take a predetermined amount (e.g., 3 to 5
      drops) from the blood culture and directly place it in the peptone
      broth described elsewhere herein; and incubate (e.g., at 37 DEG C.
      for 24 hours) the peptone broth. Blood plasma or serum can be used
      in a suitable container such as a test tube. Blood is its own
      media and no media need be added to it. This test procedure will
      give a negative or positive result depending upon the absence or
      presence, respectively, of chorionic gonadotropic hormone in the
      urine speciment. (It should be noted that minimal essentially,
      undetectable amounts of chorionic gonadotropic hormone may be
      present in the urine due to the presence of pathologically
      insignificant amounts of Cryptocides that are universally present
      in man and animal.) A positive indication (colony growth) will
      occur, if it is going to at all, in approximately ten days.<br>
      <br>
      (The microorganism from the colonies from the urine-blood cultures
      may be tumorogenic and antibiotic.)<br>
      <br>
      Negative, e.g., hormone, indications are always obtained when the
      sample from the blood specimen is first cultivated on a plate
      (e.g., agar) and then the colony is placed in the peptone broth.
      Negative indications are always obtained when the urine is culture
      on a blood plate (i.e., media has been added) and the colony is
      then placed (e.g., place blood plate with colony between fingers
      and squeeze over top of the broth test tube) in the peptone broth.
      In both instances negative indications are present even when more
      than normal amounts of chorionic gonedotropic hormone are present
      in the urine. Proper postivie indications are obtained when blood
      in test tube is used, but improper negative indications are
      obtained when blood in plates using a solid media is used. It has
      been reported that Cryptocides is anaerobic, which may explain the
      aforegoing. Also there may be present a mixture of phases of the
      microbe due to the pleomorphic nature of microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      A positive indication means that the person or animal from whom
      the urine specimen was taken has a chronic underlying disease or
      infection, such as, cancer. This test can be used to detect all of
      the above listed neoplastic diseases.<br>
      <br>
      Describing the prognostic test, the same procedure is used as
      described above for the preparation of the incubated peptone
      broth. Any resultant positive indication is measured
      conventionally for intensity or magnitude and/or length of
      duration of such positive indication. This gives results or
      measurements that can be compared with prior or future results or
      measurements from other incubated peptone broths made from the
      same patient. The prognostic test gives qualitative and
      quantitative results.<br>
      <br>
      Since the presence of the bacterium can be proven by the product
      it makes, if the patient is well, the bacterium is attenuated
      (surpressed) and does not make significant amounts of the product.
      When the patient gets worse, cryptocides makes more chorionic
      gonadotropic hormone so prognostic tests can successively be made.<br>
      <br>
      Corroboration was achieved by passing cultures, having positive
      indications, from primary blood isolates into the next test tube
      with the presence of blood. The passed cultures were allowed to
      grow until visible growth was seen. The growth was tested and it
      gave positive indications.<br>
      <br>
      Another test for determining or detecting the presence of
      chorionic gonadotropic hormone which indicates the presence of a
      chronic underlying disease or infection in blood and tissue which
      produces the chorionic gonedotropin hormone involves a skin test.
      The vaccine described above is subcutaneously placed under the
      skin. If a welt appears, it is a positive indication that
      chorionic gonadotropin hormone is present and that a chronic
      underlying disease or infection exists in the patient.<br>
      <br>
      A variation of the above skin test involves conventionally
      extracting a tuberculin-like substance from the vaccine described
      above, and subcutaneously inserting the extracted substance. If a
      welt appears, it is a positive indication that chronic
      gonadotropic hormone is present and that a chronic underlying
      disease or infection exists in the patient.<br>
      <br>
      The urine test is the preferred detection test.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants' urine test is exquisitively sensitive to a chorionic
      gonadotropic hormone--there are no interferring substance In other
      words, applicants' urine test is specific to chorionic
      gonadotropic hormones--it is a serological, higly specific test.<br>
      <br>
      The urine speciments from seven cancer patient were each placed
      into separate test tubes containing only A-J peptone broth as the
      medium. There was specific growth in each test tube. The colonies
      were removed in each instance and were subjected to separation
      (extraction) processes until only the microorganism was left. Each
      of the seven isolated microorganism specimens were placed in
      separate test tubes containing only A-J peptone broth (no blood or
      agar was used). In each of the seven tubes, a positive reaction
      was obtained confirming the fact that the microorganism which
      produces chorionic gonadotropic hormone was present.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants do not known of any other microorganisms besides
      Cryptocides which produces chorionic gonadotropic hormone, which
      gives a positive result in applicants' urine test.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that the standard pregnancy test will give a positive
      indication when chorionic gonadotropic hormone is present. It is
      also known that a positive indication can be obtained in the
      pregancy test from aspirin.<br>
      <br>
      Some state that cancer is essentially a cesspool for the
      collection of microorganisms, but applicants have found that only
      Cryptocides causes cancer and it is the only microorganism which
      produces chorionic gonadotropic hormone. Dr. Ross and others have
      stated in several instances that chorionic gonadotropic hormones
      are produced when a patient has cancer and that the chorionic
      gonadotropic hormone emanates from cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants have found that the chorionic gonadotropic hormone
      and/or biologically related hormones and sterols which yield a
      positive indication in a standard pregnency test and which can be
      identified by gas chromatography emanates from Cryptocides, which
      causes the cancer. An example of such a biologically related
      sterol are the phytosterols. An example of such a pregnency test
      is Walpole's "UCG-Test" pregnancy test which detects human
      chorionic gonadotropic immunologically in the urine of pregnant
      women.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Ross's tests used blood and found the presence of chorionic
      gonadotropic hormone. These are called the L-tests. Applicants are
      able to detect cancer by detecting the presence of chorionic
      gonadotropic hormone in urine. Applicants' can use their test in a
      diagnostic sense, that is, it can be used to determine if cancer
      is present. Applicants' can also use their urine test in a
      prognostic sense, that is, they can use it to see whether or not
      the amount of chorionic gonadotropic hormone has increased or
      decreased, and can use it to indicate the treatment to be used
      (depending on whether the patient's condition is better or worse).<br>
      <br>
      Lactrile states that the chorionic gonadotropic hormone which is
      in the embryo stage is different from the other stages.
      Applicants' urine test detects chorionic gonadotropic hormone
      regardless of the stage it is in. (Kitts stated that all of the
      cancer cells are in the first stage).<br>
      <br>
      Chorionic gonadotropic hormone is a water soluble,
      gonadstimulating glycoprotein.<br>
      <br>
      <b>VACCINE PREPARATION</b><br>
      <br>
      Researchers for a number of decades have been seeking tumor
      antagonists not only in the form of antibiotics, which are
      chemicals secreted by other microorganisms, but through potential
      immunization by the use of other microorganisms. These biologicals
      are in sharp contrast to the chemotherapeutic agents that seek to
      destroy the dividing tumor cell regardless of the entailed immune
      suppress Applicants have used the causative agent itself as a
      menas of immunization.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants have prepared and used an autogenous vaccine for the
      treatment of chronic, ongoing infections. Customarily the vaccines
      are prepared from urine, nasal, throat and bowel secretion as well
      as from various tissues and other secretions. The vaccines are
      used for the building up of immunity in the chronically ill
      patient who suffers from a failure to produce immune bodies
      against his chronic infection. This state of nonresponse is called
      immunoincompetence. Applicants do not represent to the cancer
      patient that the use of autogenous vaccine is proposed for the
      treatment of cancer but for their underlying failure of immune
      competence. In many cancer patients applicants do not use
      autogenous vaccine. The use of vaccines must be carefully weighed
      in the evaluation of the patients' immune status. In some cases
      the use of vaccines are actually contraindicated. In the seriously
      ill cancer patient the most important thing is to raise the
      patient's immunity by the use of fresh whole blood transfusions
      from suitable donors, and by the use of antibodies such as gamma
      globulin. The next most important thing is to treat their chronic
      underlying infection whatever it may be with suitable antibiotics.
      The removalof harmful substances from the diet is essential as
      well as the addition of needed vitamins and nutriments that may be
      lacking in the seriously ill because of lack of appetite and
      weight loss and faulty diet. Applicants do not believe that
      vaccines can cure the cancer patient. It is one of the modalities
      used for the chronically ill whatever their disease in the effort
      to restore their resistance to an ongoing; underlying chronic
      disease.<br>
      <br>
      It is now incontrovertible that the cancer disease results in the
      loss of immunity yet it is treated with radiation which destroys
      immunity and with drugs which encourage cancerous growth. An
      abstract of "Carcinogenicity Studies of Clinically used Anticancer
      Agents", D. P. Griswold, J. D. Prejean, A. E. Casey, J. H.
      Weisburger, E. K. Weisburger, H. B. Wood, Jr., and H. L. Falk.
      Southern Research Institute, Memorial Institute of Pathology and
      Baptist Medical Center, Birmingham, Ala. 35205, and National
      Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. 20014, shows a number of
      drugs, which produce cancer in experimental animals, yet whose use
      is advocated by a government agency and the medical profession.
      Such drugs include Melphalan, Chlorambucil, uracil mustard,
      Natulan, dimethyltriazenoimidazole carboxamide, and 1,3-bis
      (2-chloroethyl-) and 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea.
      Some of these are so-called anticancer drugs. Tumors of several
      types and at a variety of sites were seen in mice and rats during
      a testing of such drugs for carcinogencity.<br>
      <br>
      Applicants repeat that they do not treat cancer with vaccines, use
      autogenous vaccines obtained from the patients' own tissues and
      body fluids to treat an underlying chronic infection. These
      organisms are not present in cancer alone but also in a host of
      collagen diseases and in healthy carriers as well, and that the
      use of vaccines for chronic disease states is an accepted modality
      in therepeutic medicine. Use of applicants' autogenic vaccine is
      therefor beneficial to a patient whether or not the patient has
      cancer. However, by giving the patients good nutrition, by helping
      them fight off chronic infection, and by using any and all
      accepted modalities that may be helpful, applicants assist the
      patients in throwing off their diseased condition, whatever it may
      be.<br>
      <br>
      The production of vaccines from blood cultures is a rather long
      and tedious procedure. Applicants use the following method for
      making autogenous vaccines from urine. Applicants use sheep cell
      blood agar with phenyl ethyl alcohol, which inhibits the growth of
      E. coli, a common contaminant. Either the patient leaves the urine
      as directed with a testor or follows these directions at home:<br>
      1. Boil a screw-top bottle and top for twenty minutes. Let it
      cool. Remove with sterile tongs which have been boiled or
      disinfected in rubbing alcohol.<br>
      2. Take a bath. If a female, take a douche and wash off
      thoroughly.<br>
      3. Using three balls of sterile cotton wash off from front to back
      three times over the perineum with either Phisohex or some other
      mild disinfectant such as St 37. If a male, pull back the foreskin
      and wash throughly three times separately with each of the three
      cotton balls.<br>
      4. Start the urine stream over the toilet bowl and then catch the
      midstream into the sterile bottle without contaminating the
      inside. Be careful to keep the fingers out of the inside of the
      screwtop cap. Tighten the cap throughly to prevent leakage.<br>
      <br>
      When the urine is received in the laboratory it is streaked onto
      the sterile blood plates using sterile swabs. The plates are then
      incubated in the usual way. Generally within 12 hours small
      colonies have formed. When these have been properly identified by
      allowing the growth to continue for a day or two to be sure that
      the characteristic colonies are present, then a single colony is
      studied by Ziehl-Neelsen stain, Kinyoun type, for acid fastness
      and the characteristic morphology. Then a single, identified
      colony is spread on one or two additional plates where they are
      incubated until sufficient growth has accurred. Stained
      preparations are again examined. The colonies are then swabbed off
      into a 2 percent phenol solution and permitted to stand overnight.
      Then after about eight hours, the phenolized cultures are diluted
      to 0.5 percent phenol. It requires about two weeks to complete the
      sterility tests and to make several dilutions according to
      government regulations. Autogenous vaccines tailored for each
      individual are prepared, but this procedure is not so limited. The
      vaccines are made up into 10 million, 100 million, and 1,000
      million (=1 billion) organisms per c.c. The lowest amount, 10
      million organisms per cc, is used as the starting bottle for
      progressive immunization. Doses are taken every three to five days
      depending on the reaction. It is wise to start with 0.1 cc by
      subcutaneous injection of the lowest amount and observe for
      evidence of redness or soreness at the site of the injection or
      symptoms of hpersensitivity such as mild fever, lalaise, or muscle
      or joint pains. if there is a mild reaction, the patient waits
      until it subsides. before repeating the same dose or smaller in
      three to five days by mouth. If there is no reaction, then the
      dose is increased by 0.1 cc to 0.2 cc and administered first by
      subcutaneous and then orally in three to five days. The third
      week, the dose is increased again by 0.1 cc to 0.3 cc
      subcutaneously and repeated orally again in three to five days.
      The oral dose is taken under the tongue and held in the mouth for
      absorption. The vaccine is increased in this manner until twenty
      drops are taken. Then the next higher dilution of organisms is
      started in bottle number two or 100 million organisms per cc. The
      starting dose is only 0.1 cc since the second dilution is ten
      times as strong as the first one. Again the doses are increased
      gradually and so on with the other bottles of the vaccines. A
      vaccine usually lasts six months but if there is quite a change in
      the character of the organisms under treatment the occasionally it
      is good to prepare a new vaccine in three months. This method just
      described is applicants' preferred method of preparation of
      autogenous vaccines and their administration.<br>
      <br>
      The single most important factor in the presentation of vaccines
      is to rule out common contaminents. The colonies can be entirely
      confluent in severely infected hosts so that a transplant must be
      made in order to isolate individual colonies for study. The
      typical colony has an umbonate (fried egg) shape and may or may
      not be hemolytic. The colonies may also be wrinkled or smooth,
      china white or pale tan and even pale pink or orange when grown in
      the dark. The slides are made by lightly wiping a culture from the
      plate with a sterile cotton swab or with a platinum loop onto the
      surface of the glass slide and fixing it with gentle heat. One
      colony only should be selected and a cross-section should be
      studied by taking samples from the center outward to the periphery
      to obtain the different pleomorphic stages. If the material is
      handled gently they ray formation of the growth will not be broken
      up. The Kinyoum modification of the Ziehl-Neelsen stain is used
      since it can be applied in the cold for five minutes and does not
      require heating. The red dye is washed off with sterile distilled
      water and the slide is then briefly decolorized with 1 percent
      hydrochloric acid in 70 percent alcohol. The Cryptocides organisms
      are more sensitive to decolorization by acid-alcohol than the
      tubercle bacillus. The slide is washed again and the methylene
      blue counterstain is applied, 6 to 8 drops of normal (4%) of
      sodium hydroxide are added. After 30 seconds it is washed off.
      After the slide is air-dried it is ready for examination under the
      light microscope at not less than .times.800 with oil immersion.
      If slides are prepared from tissue impression smears of tumors,
      the same procedure is followed but Alexander-Jackson's triple
      stain may be applied to duplicate slides in order to differentiate
      the non-acid fast forms of Cryptocides from common contaminants.
      At times, the Cryptocides organism is not acid-fast in some stages
      of its growth.<br>
      <br>
      Usually the organism isolates out in the coccal form which has led
      many investigators to believe they are dealing with a
      staphylococcus. However, the cocci will be both acid-fast and
      non-acid-fast and will vary greatly in shape from the very small
      to the large globoidal or sac forms which often stain blue and
      appear to be spilling out the red acid-fast cocci much as marbles
      out of a bag. In addition, the cocci appear to split
      longitudinally into small rods. The cocci, after a period of time,
      have small filaments spouting from them which turn into rods that
      are red or acid-fast. If the culture is not mutilated by rough
      handling, often the large tublar forms can be seen which are
      observed by darkfield microscope in fresh blood. These are very
      delicate and disrupt easily. The ray formation may also be
      apparent but the sheath is extremely diaphanous and is destroyed
      often in the staining process. Sometimes the cancer organism can
      isolate out primarily as a rod or even as a branching hyphal form.
      At other times clublike bodies are seen which are blue in color
      and contain the acid-fast bodies within them. It is very important
      to study a number of the colonies on the plates and to be sure
      that the various transitional forms of the organism can be seen in
      one isolated colony. Only then may the organism be grown in
      sufficient amount to harvest for the vaccine. All of this work
      requires careful examination and experience to be sure of the
      growth pattern and morphology of the Cryptocides.<br>
      <br>
      The organisms isolated from the urine cultures have been
      classified under various names such as staphylococcus epidermidis
      and enterococcus fecalis, in other words, common organisms found
      on the skin and in the bowel. However, by careful sterile methods
      microorganisms are found to be growing from the urine in great
      abundance. Microbiologists are still debating the nature and
      classification of these organisms. A recent paper, which appeared
      in Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences, by Dr.
      Florence Seibert, claims that these isolates from her material
      which yield certain supposedly well-known microorganisms are not
      the standard well-recognized types at all but the acid-fast
      organisms which we have classified as the Cryptocides.
      Microbiologists who examined applicants' urine cultures state that
      there are a variety of organisms in applicants' urine vaccines.
      What is known is that these organisms occur in large numbers and
      are often hemolytic (destructive of red blood cells). Very
      possibly urine cultures contain a mixture of whatever microbes
      that happen to filter through the kidneys from distant body foci.
      Applicants use the mixture in vaccines only as nonspecific immune
      booster in chronic disease.<br>
      <br>
      The vaccine can be prepared by the following preferred method. To
      10 cc of heparinized freshly-drawn sterile blood add 10 cc sterile
      distilled water. Heat over the Bunsen burner to boiling several
      times (to break the red cells). Incubate for 10 to 12 days at 37
      DEG to 38 DEG C. This gives the growing culture without addition
      of media, since blood acts as its own medium without the addition
      of anything else. Add 4 percent formalin (formaldehyde) to
      inactivate (kill) the P. Cryptocides. The admixture is put through
      a microfilter to remove the dead or microorganisms. The live
      attenuated microorganisms go through the filters. Then dilute the
      filtrate with sterile saline solution until the final solution
      contains 1% formalin. This is then tested for sterility and than
      can be used as an autogenous vaccine.<br>
      <br>
      The autogenous vaccine can be used to immunize against underlying
      chronic diseases or infections, or neoplastic diseased which
      produce choroninic gonedotropic hormone and/or biologically
      related hormones and sterols which yield a positive indication in
      a standard pregnancy test and which can be identified by gas
      chromatography and which are caused by Cryptocides.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Research has found that certain bacteria are associated with human
      cancers. Their role, however, is still unclear. Convincing
      evidence links some species to carcinogenesis while others appear
      promising in the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of cancers.
      The complex relationship between bacteria and humans is
      demonstrated by Helicobacter pylori and Salmonella typhi
      infections. Research has shown that H. pylori can cause gastric
      cancer or MALT lymphoma in some individuals. In contrast, exposure
      to H. pylori appears to reduce the risk of esophageal cancer in
      others. Salmonella typhi infection has been associated with the
      development of gallbladder cancer; however S. typhi is a promising
      carrier of therapeutic agents for melanoma, colon and bladder
      cancers. Thus bacterial species and their roles in particular
      cancers appear to differ among different individuals. Many
      species, however, share an important characteristic: highly
      site-specific colonization. This critical factor may lead to the
      development of non-invasive diagnostic tests, innovative
      treatments and cancer vaccines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      An overwhelming body of evidence has determined that relationships
      among certain bacteria and cancers exist. The bacterial mechanisms
      involved are as yet unclear. These gaps in knowledge make it
      impossible to state the exact progression of events by which
      specific bacteria may cause, colonize or cure cancer. Therefore,
      many questions remain. For example, why do infections that are
      wide spread appear to cause cancer in only a minority of
      individuals? Do certain infective agents initiate or promote
      cancer or does an early undetected cancer facilitate the
      acquisition of the infection? Can the exposure to or colonization
      of specific bacteria prevent or treat certain cancers? Can the
      highly site specific colonization of certain bacteria for a tumor
      be clinically useful in the diagnosis of cancer or delivery of a
      therapeutic agent?<br>
      <br>
      The scope of this review is broad therefore a wide range of
      reports is presented. Recent findings that have found associations
      between certain bacterial infections and tumor development will be
      discussed as well as genetic factors that may predispose
      individuals to "cancer- causing" infections. Mechanisms thought to
      be involved with the carcinogenic, diagnostic and preventive or
      treatment roles of bacteria are introduced. As the carcinogenic
      potential of viral agents and H. pylori has been reviewed
      extensively elsewhere, it will not be included here.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bacteria and carcinogenesis</b><br>
      <br>
      It is estimated that over 15% of malignancies worldwide can be
      attributed to infections or about 1.2 million cases per year.
      Pisani et al. [1] Infections involving viruses, bacteria and
      schistosomes have been linked to higher risks of malignancy.
      Although viral infections have been strongly associated with
      cancers [2,3] bacterial associations are significant. For example,
      convincing evidence has linked Helicobacter pylori with both
      gastric cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
      lymphoma [4-6], however other species associated with cancers
      include: Salmonella typhi and gallbladder cancer [7-10],
      Streptococcus bovis and colon cancer [11-14] and Chlamydia
      pneumoniae with lung cancer [15-17]. Important mechanisms by which
      bacterial agents may induce carcinogenesis include chronic
      infection, immune evasion and immune suppression [18].<br>
      <br>
      It has been shown that several bacteria can cause chronic
      infections or produce toxins that disturb the cell cycle resulting
      in altered cell growth [15,16,19]. The resulting damage to DNA is
      similar to that caused by carcinogenic agents as the genes that
      are altered control normal cell division and apoptosis [20,21].
      Processes that encourage the loss of cellular control may be tumor
      initiators (directly causing mutations) or promoters (facilitating
      mutations). Tumorigenesis is initiated when cells are freed from
      growth restraints, later promotion results when the immune system
      is evaded favoring further mutations and increased loss of cell
      control. As the tumor proliferates an increased blood supply is
      needed resulting in the organization of blood vessels or
      angiogenesis. Subsequent invasion occurs if the tumor breaks down
      surrounding tissues. The worst outcome is metastasis which results
      when cells break away from the tumor and seed tumors at distant
      sites [8].<br>
      <br>
      The immune system is an important line of defense for tumor
      formation of malignancies that express unique antigens. Certain
      bacterial infections may evade the immune system or stimulate
      immune responses that contribute to carcinogenic changes through
      the stimulatory and mutagenic effects of cytokines released by
      inflammatory cells. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS),
      [22,23], interleukin-8 (IL-8) [11], cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),
      [24], reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) [25].
      Chronic stimulation of these substances along with environmental
      factors such as smoking, or a susceptible host appears to
      contribute significantly to carcinogenesis.<br>

      <b>Salmonella typhi and gallbladder cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Worldwide annual incidence of gallbladder cancer (GC) is 17
      million cases with high incidence rates in certain populations.
      The malignancy is usually associated with gallstone disease, late
      diagnosis, unsatisfactory treatment, and poor prognosis. The
      five-year survival rate is approximately 32 percent for lesions
      confined to the gallbladder mucosa and one-year survival rate of
      10 percent for more advanced stages [26]. Over 90 percent of
      gallbladder carcinomas are adenocarcinoma [27] involving
      gallstones in 78% – 85% of cases [26].<br>
      <br>
      There are several risk factors for gallbladder cancer. The main
      associated risk factors include cholelithiasis (especially
      untreated chronic symptomatic gallstones), obesity, reproductive
      factors, environmental exposure to certain chemicals, congenital
      developmental abnormalities of the pancreatic bile-duct junction
      and chronic infections of the gallbladder [26,28]. The interplay
      of genetic susceptibility, lifestyle factors and infections in
      gallbladder carcinogenesis is still poorly understood [29],
      however a link has been specifically proposed between chronic
      bacterial infections of the gallbladder and Salmonella typhi [26].<br>
      <br>
      The strongest epidemiological evidence of bacterial oncogenic
      potential, aside of Helicobacter pylori, concerns S. typhi.
      Infection with this bacterium of typhoid, can lead to chronic
      bacterial carriage in the gallbladder [30]. Recent epidemiological
      studies have shown that those who become carriers of S. typhi have
      8.47 times the increased risk of developing carcinoma of the
      gallbladder compared with people who have had acute typhoid and
      have cleared the infection [26]. These findings agreed with
      earlier investigations by Welton et al. [31] and Caygill [30].<br>
      <br>
      A case-control study by Welton et al [31] compared those who
      experienced acute infection with S. typhi to those who
      subsequently became chronic carriers following the 1922 typhoid
      outbreak in New York. Carriers were six times more likely to die
      of hepatobiliary carcinoma than matched controls. Additional
      evidence was found in an analysis of the 1964 typhoid outbreak in
      Aberdeen [30]. Their findings also suggested a strong association
      between chronic carrier status and hepatobiliary carcinoma. These
      studies also agreed, people who contracted typhoid but did not
      become carriers were not at higher risk of cancer [8,26,30,31].<br>
      <br>
      The highest incidence of gallbladder cancer (GC) in the world is
      among populations of the Andean area, North American Indians, and
      Mexican Americans. In Europe, the highest rates are found in
      Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The high rates observed
      in Latin America are primarily in populations with high levels of
      Indian mixture [32]. This evidence supports the notion that
      increased susceptibility to gallbladder cancer depends on genetic
      factors that predispose people to gallbladder cancer either as
      primary factors, or secondarily as promoters by favoring the
      development of cholesterol gallstones. The highest mortality rates
      are in South America, (3.5–15.5 per 100,000) and among Mexican
      Americans [26]. Incidence rates of GC in various ethnic groups in
      the USA confirmed the worldwide pattern, as GC was substantially
      more frequent among Hispanic than non-Hispanic white women and
      men. Interestingly, compared to non-Hispanic whites an excess of
      GC was also reported among American Indians in New Mexico, in
      agreement with the excess in incidence rates reported for American
      Indians and Alaskan Natives [33]. The malignancy is 3 times
      higher, however, among women than men in all populations [26].<br>
      <br>
      Two main pathways to GC exist worldwide. The predominant pathway
      involves gallstones and resultant cholecystitis and affects women
      to a greater extent than men. The risk of developing gallstones in
      response to environmental factors is genetically determined, as
      shown by the marked tendency of gallstones to cluster in families
      [34]. The other pathway involves an anomalous pancreatobiliary
      duct junction (APBDJ), a congenital malformation of the biliary
      tract that is more frequent in Japan, Korea, and possibly China,
      than in Western countries [28]. In APBDJ, the premature junction
      of common bile and pancreatic ducts results in regurgitation of
      pancreatic juice into the gallbladder, leading to bile stasis and
      inflammation, though generally less severe than that resulting
      from gallstones [28].<br>
      <br>
      Currently the prevention of gallbladder cancer in high risk
      populations depends upon the diagnosis of gallstones and removal
      of the gallbladder. Indeed, a strong inverse association between
      number of cholecystectomies and GC incidence and mortality rates
      can be found in many countries. The increase of GC mortality
      reported in Chile in the 1980s was related to decreased rates of
      cholecystectomies [35]. Increased rates led to the removal of
      gallbladders at risk, and a reduction of GC incidence and
      mortality in Europe and the United States [36].<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, information about the genetic changes involved in
      gallbladder carcinogenesis is limited. Most studies have focused
      on gene abnormalities and deletions ("loss of heterozygosity") at
      chromosomal regions harboring known or putative tumor suppressor
      genes [28]. It appears, however, that TP53 inactivation has an
      important and early role in gallbladder carcinoma associated with
      gallstones and chronic inflammation. This inactivation would
      abrogate the tumor suppressor function of the p53 protein
      resulting in impairments in cell cycle control, cellular repair
      and apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, KRAS mutations are frequent and early events in
      tumors associated with APBDJ [28] but detected less often in
      gallbladder carcinomas associated with gallstones. KRAS is an
      oncogene that encodes a protein that is a member of the small
      GTPase family. A mutation in this gene results in an abnormal
      protein implicated in several malignancies, including lung
      adenocarcinoma, ductal carcinoma of the pancreas and colorectal
      carcinoma among others.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Chlamydophila pneumoniae and lung cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United
      States and many countries in the Western world. In 2002, the most
      recent year for which statistics are available, 90,121 males and
      67,509 females died from lung cancer [37]. About 6 out of 10
      people with lung cancer die within 1 year of finding out they have
      lung cancer. Between 7 and 8 will die within 2 years [38].
      Although patients may experience a partial or complete response to
      treatment, most patients relapse and die. Increased dosage of
      chemotherapy or length of treatment has not been beneficial [39].<br>
      <br>
      Chlamydophila (formerly Chlamydia) pneumoniae infection has been
      implicated in several chronic lung diseases by serology and direct
      antigen detection. Acute lower respiratory tract infection caused
      by C. pneumoniae seems often to precede attacks of asthma in both
      children and adults but is also involved in some exacerbations of
      chronic bronchitis. More importantly it seems to be strongly
      associated with chronic obstructive lung disease irrespective of
      exacerbation status. Moreover, persistently elevated C. pneumoniae
      antibody titers have been observed in sarcoidosis and lung cancer
      [40].<br>
      <br>
      C. pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacillus and an intracellular
      parasite that causes respiratory infection in more than 50% of
      adults. The route of transmission is usually by aerosol and in
      most cases these infections are mild. The bacterium is, however,
      an important cause of pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, rhinitis
      and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [41]. Respiratory
      infections from C. pneumoniae vary in different countries and
      populations, being endemic in the United States and epidemic in
      Scandinavian countries [19].<br>
      <br>
      After acute infection the C. pneumoniae intracellular life cycle
      is characterized by the development of metabolically inert (and
      thus antibiotic resistant) atypical "persistent" inclusions. These
      inclusions contain increased quantities of chlamydial heat shock
      protein 60, a highly immunogenic protein implicated in the
      pathogenesis of chronic chlamydial infections. The resulting
      clinical course is acute symptomatic illness followed by chronic
      respiratory symptoms. Research also suggests that persistent C.
      pneumoniae inflammation correlates with increased risk of lung
      cancer [16,17,19]. Prospective and retrospective studies both
      report that individuals with elevated IgA antibody titers to this
      organism have 50% to 100% increased lung cancer risk [15].<br>
      <br>
      In a study by Kocazeybek et al. [19] the relationship between
      chronic C. pneumoniae infection and lung carcinoma was examined. A
      total of 123 patients who were smokers and diagnosed with lung
      carcinoma based on clinical and laboratory (radiological,
      cytological) findings were examined. 101 (82.1%) of the cases were
      male. 70 had small-cell, 28 squamous-cell and 7 large-cell
      carcinomas, while 18 had adenocarcinoma. 123 healthy controls were
      matched to the cancer patients by age, gender, duration of smoking
      and locality.<br>
      <br>
      Blood samples (5 ml) were withdrawn at the time of diagnosis (or
      enrollment for controls) and 1 month later. Values between IgG
      ≥512 and IgA ≥40 were set as the criteria for chronic C.
      pneumoniae infections. In male patients with lung carcinoma, IgG
      antibody titers of ≥512 and IgA antibody titers of ≥40 were found
      at a higher rate than in the control group, however, this ratio
      was not significant for female patients. These elevations in
      antibody titers were found in a total of 62 (50.4 %) cases, 54% of
      the male patients and 36% of the female patients. Chronic C.
      pneumoniae infections were seen statistically more often in male
      patients with carcinoma who were aged 55 years or younger than in
      controls (P &lt; 0.001). No difference was reported between male
      patients with lung carcinoma over age 55 and controls or in blood
      titers between female patients and controls.<br>
      <br>
      The relationship between C. pneumoniae infection and lung
      carcinoma was studied by Littman et al. [42] in a large
      prospective case-control study to investigate whether IgA antibody
      titers to C. pneumoniae were associated with lung cancer risk. A
      total of 508 pairs were enrolled and included both current and
      former smokers. Serum was collected at baseline and annually
      thereafter. Antibody determinations of each lung cancer subject
      and matched control were tested simultaneously in the same
      titration series in a blinded fashion. C. pneumoniae titers (IgA
      or IgG) ≥16 were considered seropositive, which was consistent
      with the cutoff used in other studies. Subjects were matched by
      age, gender, and smoking status at baseline. The median age of
      cases and controls was 59 years and about half were women. All
      subjects were also examined for demographic, lifestyle, dietary,
      and racial and ethnic factors. Lung cancer subjects had a heavier
      smoking history than controls.<br>
      <br>
      After adjusting for a history of chronic bronchitis or emphysema,
      lung cancer subjects were more likely to have IgA titers ≥16
      (55.4% vs. 51.3%) and ≥256 (5.1% vs. 2.5%) to C. pneumoniae than
      controls. Individuals with antibody tiers IgA ≥16 had 1.2 times
      the risk of lung cancer (95% confidence interval, 0.9–1.6)
      compared to those with lower titers. Investigators reported a
      significant trend (P = 0.007) of increasing odds ratios with
      increasing IgA titers primarily due to an odds ratio of 2.8 (95%
      confidence interval, 1.1–6.7) associated with titers ≥256.
      Elevated IgA was reported with squamous cell carcinomas and to a
      lesser extent, for small cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.
      There was no evidence of a stronger association with elevated IgG
      titers however. Subjects with race not classified as White or
      Black were more likely to have IgA titers ≥16. No significant
      differences in seropositivity were found, however, based on
      smoking behaviors.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Streptococcus bovis and colorectal cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignancy in developed
      countries and is the 3rd most common cancer in the United States
      [38]. Greater than 80% occur sporadically [43]. The American
      Cancer Society estimates that there will be about 104,950 new
      cases of colon cancer and 40,340 new cases of rectal cancer in
      2005 in the United States. Combined, they will cause about 56,290
      deaths. The risk of colon cancer increases after the age of 40 and
      rises exponentially from the ages of 50 to 55. In fact, more than
      9 out of 10 people found to have colorectal cancer are older than
      50 [38].<br>
      <br>
      Survival of CRC is related to the stage of disease at the time of
      the initial diagnosis. Between 1985 and 1997, death rates of colon
      cancer in the United States declined slightly due to earlier
      detection of primary tumors, via stool blood tests, sigmoidoscopy,
      colonoscopy, and screening tests for serum carcinoembryonic
      antigen concentration (CEA) [44]. The 5-year survival rate for CRC
      patients is greater than 90% when tumors are detected at a
      localized early stage. After the cancer has spread regionally and
      involves adjacent organs or lymph nodes, the rate drops to 40–65%;
      survival is less than 10% for patients with distant metastases.
      Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective treatment
      strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality. Surgery is currently
      the primary treatment modality for this disease. By the time the
      patient presents with recurrent symptoms, however, the disease is
      rarely curable by surgery even when combined with other therapies
      [45].<br>
      <br>
      Several species of bacteria have been linked to chronic infections
      of the colon and increased risk of colon cancer including
      Escherichia coli [46] and several streptococci [47,48]. Recent
      studies, however, have validated earlier findings of an
      association between colon cancer and Streptococcus bovis [11,12].
      As early as 1951, McCoy and Mason [49] suggested a relationship
      between colonic carcinoma and the presence of infectious
      endocarditis. It was not until 1974 [50] that the association of
      Streptococcus bovis and colonic neoplasia was recognized, as
      25–80% of patients who presented with a S. bovis bacteremia had a
      colorectal tumor. The incidence of S. bovis associated colon
      cancer has been determined as 18% to 62% [14].<br>
      <br>
      S. bovis is a normal inhabitant of the human gastrointestinal
      tract that can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, and urinary
      infection [51]. Although S. bovis is the 2nd greatest cause of
      infectious endocarditis from streptococci [50], it is frequently
      associated with gastrointestinal lesions, especially carcinoma of
      the colon [12,51-53]. Notably, the colonic neoplasia may arise
      years after the presentation of the condition of bacteremia or
      infectious endocarditis [12].<br>
      <br>
      A retrospective review of forty-five documented cases of S bovis
      bacteremia was conducted by Gold et al. [12]. Subjects were
      identified by a search of computerized bacteriology records from
      one tertiary referral hospital and 1 community hospital located in
      the same city. Patient records were reviewed to identify the
      presence of colonic neoplasia, the use of gastrointestinal
      endoscopy, and the presence of gastrointestinal or extraintestinal
      malignancies. Seventeen patients (41% of adult patients) underwent
      colonoscopy. Colonic neoplasia was present in 16 patients (39% of
      adults). Invasive cancer was present in 13 patients (32% of
      adults), 8 of these had malignant lesions arising within the
      gastrointestinal tract, 3 affecting the colon and 5 patients had
      extraintestinal malignancies. The authors concluded that S. bovis
      bacteremia was associated with both colonic neoplasia and
      extracolonic malignancy.<br>
      <br>
      It has been demonstrated that S. bovis or its wall extracted
      antigens (WEA) were able to promote carcinogenesis in rats [12].
      In one of these investigations a total of 10 adult rats received
      i.p. injections of the carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM) (15 mg/kg
      body weight) once per week for 2 weeks. Fifteen days after the
      last injection of AOM (week 4) the rats were randomly divided into
      three groups. Twice per week during 5 weeks, the rats received, by
      gavage either S. bovis (1010 bacteria Group I), WEA (100 μg Group
      II) and controls (Group III).<br>
      <br>
      One week after the last gavage (week 10), they found that
      administration of either S. bovis or its antigens promoted the
      progression of preneoplastic lesions. There were increased
      formations of hyperproliferative aberrant colonic crypts, enhanced
      expression of proliferation markers and increased production of
      IL-8 in the colonic mucosa. Normal rats treated with the bacteria
      did not develop hyperplastic colonic crypts, however. The authors
      concluded that S. bovis exerts its pathological activity in the
      colonic mucosa only when preneoplastic lesions are established.<br>
      <br>
      Under identical experimental conditions Streptococcus gordonii was
      substituted for S. bovis. The number of preneoplastic lesions in
      the colon of S. gordonii-treated rats was similar to rats treated
      with AOM alone (22 ± 2). The authors suggested that S. bovis and
      its wall extracted antigens, unlike S. gordonii, act as promoters
      of carcinogenesis in a chemically-induced animal model.<br>
      <br>
      In another investigation Biarc et al. [11] isolated 12 S. bovis
      cell-associated proteins (S300) and WEA. Cells of the human
      colonic epithelial cell line Caco-2 originally derived from an
      adenocarcinoma were grown to confluence and allowed to
      differentiate. These cells were stimulated with 200 ul of either
      S. bovis WEA (50 μg/ml) or cell-associated proteins S300 (100 μl).<br>
      <br>
      The purified S300 fraction was able to trigger the human cell line
      and rat colonic mucosa to release chemokines (human IL-8 or rat
      CINC/GRO) and prostaglandin E2 (PgE2). The 12 S. bovis proteins
      were highly effective in the promotion of pre-neoplastic lesions
      in azoxymethane treated rats. In fact the S300 proteins were able
      to induce a 5-fold increase in PGE2 secretion from Caco-2 cells,
      as compared with cells stimulated with WEA. The study found that
      PGE2 release in the human cells correlated with an over-expression
      of cyclooxygease-2 (COX-2).<br>
      <br>
      Evidence has shown that over-expression of COX-2 has a major role
      in mucosal inflammation [47] and is associated with inhibition of
      apoptosis [54] and enhancement of angiogenesis [55], which favor
      cancer initiation and development. It was reported by Biarc et al.
      [11] that S. bovis proteins also promoted cell proliferation by
      triggering mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which can
      increase the incidence of cell transformation, the rate of genetic
      mutations and up-regulate COX-2. The investigators concluded that
      colonic bacteria such as S. bovis can contribute to cancer
      development particularly in chronic infection/inflammation
      diseases where bacterial components may interfere with cell
      function [11].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Genetic predisposition to cancer-causing infections</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Research has shown that some populations are genetically
      predisposed to the infections that are associated with cancer and
      indeed have a higher risk of the cancer in question. The exact
      mechanisms remain unclear [38].<br>
      <br>
      <b>E. coli, crohn's disease and colon cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) includes both ulcerative colitis
      (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Both of these disorders have an
      increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) [38,46,56]. Although
      colorectal cancer (CRC) in individuals with IBD only accounts for
      1–2% of all cases of CRC in the general population, it is
      considered a serious complication of the disease and accounts for
      approximately 15% of all deaths in patients with IBD. The
      magnitude of the risk has been found to differ, however, in
      population-based studies [56-58]. Recent figures suggest that the
      risk of colon cancer for people with IBD increases by 0.5–1.0%
      yearly, 8–10 years after diagnosis. The magnitude of CRC risk also
      increases with early age at IBD diagnosis, longer duration of
      symptoms, and extent of disease, with pancolitis having more
      severe inflammation and a higher risk of dysplasia-carcinoma
      progression [56].<br>
      <br>
      E. coli are found at higher levels in inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), therefore, studies have examined the mechanisms that may
      explain this phenomenon. A cell culture study by Martin et al [46]
      attempted to quantify and characterize mucosa-associated and
      intramucosal bacteria, particularly E. coli, in these inflammatory
      conditions. Their hypothesis was that the disease-associated
      alterations in mucosal glycosylation found in inflammatory bowel
      disease and colon cancer might predispose to altered recruitment
      of bacteria to the mucosa.<br>
      <br>
      Mucosa-associated bacteria were isolated from biopsy samples of
      Crohn's disease, (n = 14); ulcerative colitis, (n = 21);
      noninflamed controls, (n = 24) and at surgical resection of colon
      cancer, (n = 21). Results found that mucosa-associated and
      intramucosal bacteria were cultured more commonly in Crohn's
      disease (79%, P = 0.03; and 71%, P &lt; 0.01, respectively), and
      colon cancers (71% and 57%) than in noninflamed controls (42% and
      29%) but not ulcerative colitis (38% and 48%). Mucosa-associated
      E. coli, which accounted for 53% of isolates, were more common in
      Crohn's disease (6/14; 43%) than in noninflamed controls (4/24,
      17%), and intramucosal E. coli more common in Crohn's disease
      (29%; controls, 9%).<br>
      <br>
      E. coli expressed hemagglutinins in 39% of Crohn's cases and 38%
      of cancers but only 4% of controls, and this correlated (P = 0.01)
      with adherence to embryonic intestinal cells (I407) and colon
      adenocarcinoma cells (HT29). Although close apposition of E. coli
      resulted in release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cellular
      invasion by bacteria was not essential to this process [46].<br>
      <br>
      Aspinell [59] suggested that the bacterial adherence found by
      Martin et al. [46] might result from activation of virulence genes
      following contact of the organisms with the inflamed mucosal
      cells. Martin et al. [46] found, however, that the mucosal
      isolates expressed of none of the known virulence genes, other
      than adherence genes. Martin and co-workers concluded that their
      findings supported a central role for mucosally adherent bacteria
      in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. They postulated that
      similar, lower grade, inflammatory changes could contribute to the
      risk of sporadic cancer development [46].<br>
      <br>
      The authors stated however that it was certainly possible that the
      presence of the bacteria in the sub-mucus niche in human Crohn's
      disease and colon cancer could have been encouraged by
      disease-associated changes [46] in the mucosa. If true, their
      findings would result from colonization coincidental to the
      disease-associated alterations in mucosal glycosylation found in
      inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.<br>
      <br>
      A study conducted by Masseret et al.[60] examined the E. coli
      strains isolated from patients with Crohn's disease (CD) with
      chronic ileal lesions (n = 14), early endoscopic recurrent lesions
      (n = 20), without endoscopic recurrence (n = 7), and controls (n =
      21). Genetically linked E coli strains were isolated significantly
      more frequently from patients with chronic and recurrent CD (24/33
      patients) than from controls (9/21) (p &lt; 0.05). Most patients
      operated on for chronic ileal lesions (78.5%) harbored E coli
      strains belonging to the same cluster (p &lt; 0.002 v controls).
      The prevalence of patients with early recurrent lesions harboring
      E coli strains belonging to this cluster was high but not
      significant. 21 of 26 strains isolated from patients with active
      CD demonstrated adherent ability to differentiated Caco-2 cells,
      indicating that most of the genetically related strains shared a
      common virulence trait. Comparison of E coli strains recovered
      from ulcerated and healthy mucosa of patients operated on for CD
      demonstrated in each patient that a single strain colonized the
      intestinal mucosa. The authors suggested that although a single E
      coli isolate was not found in Crohn's ileal mucosa, some genotypes
      were more likely than others to be associated with chronic or
      early recurrent ileal lesions.<br>

      <b>S. typhi and susceptible populations</b><br>
      <br>
      As previously stated, certain populations have an increased risk
      of gallbladder cancer (GC), however certain individuals may be
      predisposed to S. typhi infection which appears to increase the
      risk of GC. In an investigation by deJong et al. [61], three
      unrelated individuals with severe, idiopathic mycobacterial and
      Salmonella infections were found to lack IL-12Rβ1 chain
      expression. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a cytokine that promotes
      cell-mediated immunity to intracellular pathogens, such as S.
      typhi, by inducing type 1 helper T cell (TH1) responses and
      interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production. IL-12 binds to the high-affinity
      β1/β2 heterodimeric IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) complexes on T cell
      and natural killer cells. The cells of these patients were
      deficient in IL-12R signaling and IFN-γ production and their
      remaining T cell responses were independent of endogenous IL-12.
      IL-12Rβ1 sequence analysis revealed genetic mutations that
      resulted in premature stop codons in the extracellular domain. The
      genetic absence of IL12-Rβ1 expression represented an immune
      deficiency in these 3 patients. Interestingly, these patients did
      not develop any abnormal infections with other viral, bacterial,
      or fungal pathogens. The defect in IFN-production and extreme
      susceptibility to mycobacterial and Salmonella infections in these
      patients appeared to be a direct result of their lack of IL-12R
      expression and signaling. The authors concluded that selective
      susceptibility to mycobacterial and Salmonella infections,
      however, suggested that the type-1 cytokine pathway was essential
      for controlling resistance to the intracellular pathogens and that
      no redundant protective immune mechanism could compensate for this
      deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Respiratory conditions and increased susceptibility to lung
        cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      75–90% of people who develop lung cancer are smokers, however,
      only a small proportion of smokers develop lung cancer [42].
      Hence, epidemiological studies such as that of Littman et al [42]
      and Kocazeybek et al. [19] have been conducted to more closely
      identify risk factors. Identifying genetic factors that increase a
      smoker's risk of developing lung cancer may help scientists to
      better understand the etiology of lung cancer and more effectively
      target high-risk groups for screening. Additionally, genetic
      factors have been identified that appear to predict the prognosis
      of certain lung cancer patients [62]. For example, mutations
      affecting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were
      significantly associated with specific genetic alterations.
      Supervised clustering analysis based on EGFR gene mutations
      elucidated a subgroup including all EGFR gene mutated tumors,
      which showed significantly shorter disease-free survival<br>
      <br>
      To analyze the genetic alterations of primary lung adenocarcinoma
      in a high-throughput way, Shibata et al. [62] used laser-capture
      micro-dissection of cancer cells and array comparative genomic
      hybridization focusing on 800 chromosomal loci containing
      cancer-related genes. They identified a large number of
      chromosomal numerical alterations, including frequent
      amplifications. Three subgroups of lung adenocarcinoma were
      characterized by distinct genetic alterations and were associated
      with smoking history and gender. The authors concluded that
      multiple carcinogenic pathways exist; certain abnormalities appear
      related to gender and smoking while others may impact survival
      [62].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bacterial strategies: cell cycle control and toxic warfare</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Bacterial toxins can kill cells or at reduced levels alter
      cellular processes that control proliferation, apoptosis and
      differentiation. These alterations are associated with
      carcinogenesis and may either stimulate cellular aberrations or
      inhibit normal cell controls. Cell-cycle inhibitors, such as
      cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) and the cycle inhibiting
      factor (Cif), block mitosis and are thought to compromise the
      immune system by inhibiting clonal expansion of lymphocytes. In
      contrast, cell-cycle stimulators such as the cytotoxic necrotizing
      factor (CNF) promote cellular proliferation and interfere with
      cell differentiation [20].<br>
      <br>
      Bacterial toxins that subvert the host eukaryotic cell cycle have
      been classified as cyclomodulins. For example, CNF is a cell-cycle
      stimulator released by certain bacteria, such as E. coli. CNF
      triggers G1 – S transition and induces DNA replication. The number
      of cells does not increase, however. The cells become
      multinucleated instead, perhaps by the toxin's ability to inhibit
      cell differentiation and apoptosis [63,64].<br>
      <br>
      Conversely the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT), as previously
      mentioned, is a cell-cycle inhibitor used by several species of
      Gram-negative bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni and S.
      typhi. The CdtB unit of CDT is a DNAse that creates
      double-stranded DNA breaks causing cell cycle arrest, usually at
      the G2 checkpoint [65]. Cif is a cell cycle inhibitor found in
      enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli.
      EPEC and EHEC deliver this novel toxin by injecting it into the
      infected epithelial cells. Cif arrests the cells at the G2/M phase
      [66]causing unique alterations in the host cell that result in
      attachment of the cytoskeleton to the host cell membrane. This
      anchoring of the cytoskeleton inhibits mitosis, causing cellular
      and nuclear enlargement. Although DNA synthesis is initiated it
      does not lead to nuclear division. Endoreduplicaton occurs
      resulting in cellular DNA content of 8–16n [20,66].<br>
      <br>
      In a cell culture study, Haghjoo and Galán [65] found that S.
      typhi produced a unique cdtB-dependent CDT that required bacterial
      internalization into host cells. When Cos-2 cells were transfected
      with S. typhi the effects of the cdtB subunit were severe
      fragmentation of chromatin characteristic of the CdtB subunit of
      CDT expressed by other species. The authors proposed that S. typhi
      subsequent to internalization deviated from the usual endocytic
      pathway that leads to lysosomes, reaching an unusual
      membrane-bound compartment where it can survive and replicate. It
      is possible that this unique CDT may be involved in some aspects
      of the ability of S. typhi to cause long, persistent infections in
      humans, because, at least in other bacteria, this toxin has been
      shown to possess immunomodulatory activities.<br>
      <br>
      Toxins are not the only strategy for evading the host's immune
      system, however. An early study by Kilian et al. [67] reported
      that some strains of Capnocytophaga ochracea, an oral pathogen,
      are capable of hydrolytically degrading immunoglobulin A subclass
      1 found in the oral cavity. This property may enhance colonization
      and invasion of oral lesions which characterize many bacteremias
      due to Capnocytophaga species. [67]. Shurin et al. [68] obtained
      evidence that Capnocytophaga species inhibit polymorphonuclear
      leukocyte migration; a means by which these species may evade
      phagocytosis.<br>
      <br>
      The immune system may also be evaded by the protection offered by
      bacterial biofilms. An example of this phenomenon is provided by
      uropathic E. coli species whose biofilms protect it from the
      immune system and making it difficult to treat these infections
      effectively by antibiotics. This has been demonstrated in bladder
      infections where the same species is recovered after repeated
      flare-ups thought to have been cleared by antibiotic therapy,
      suggesting a subclinical infection that has become chronic [69].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bacterial site-specific colonization</b><br>
      <br>
      Bacterial adherence is thought to be the first important step in
      colonization. It is now recognized that bacteria bind to and
      colonize host cells in a highly selective manner via a "lock- and
      key" mechanism. This selectivity of bacterial adhesion plays an
      important role in many infectious processes, and an understanding
      of the mechanisms involved could provide molecular explanations
      for the innate resistance or susceptibility of hosts and tissues
      to many infectious agents.<br>
      <br>
      Regulators of complement activation (RCA proteins) prevent the
      destructive consequences of inappropriate immune activation.
      Decay-accelerating factor (CD55) is a member of the RCA protein
      family that protects host cells from complement damage and
      regulates the classical, alternative and lectin pathways that
      converge to target cells for destruction in all 3 pathways of the
      innate immune system [70]. CD55 is expressed on all serum-exposed
      cells. Perhaps due to its ubiquitous expression, it is thought
      that bacterial pathogens, including uropathogenic Escherichia
      coli, use CD55 as a receptor prior to infection. Williams et al.
      [70] suggested that pathogens have evolved to exploit the cellular
      roles of this molecule thereby gaining immunological advantage
      [70].<br>
      <br>
      The influence on E. coli binding of the two known single amino
      acid polymorphisms within short consensus repeat (SCR) domains of
      CD55 was examined by Pham et al. [71] and Nowicki et al [72]. The
      bacterial strains sensitive to a change in SCR3 were found to be
      insensitive to changes in SCR4 and vice versa, suggesting that
      multiple, independent binding sites of CD55 were used by different
      bacterial strains. Evidence from those investigations suggested
      that E. coli strains sensitive to changes in one binding domain
      were not affected by changes in other domains. Furthermore, the
      use of CD55 as a receptor by a variety of uropathic E. coli was
      found to correlate with symptomatic infections [71,72]. Evidence
      from those investigations indicated the extraordinary degree of
      site-specific colonization of these closely related strains.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bacteria associated with a coincidental or diagnostic role</b><br>
      <br>
      Each year nearly 30,000 Americans are diagnosed with oral cancer
      [73,74]. Over 90% of these malignancies are oral squamous cell
      carcinoma (OSCC). Despite advances in surgery, radiation and
      chemotherapy, the five-year survival rate is 54%, one of the
      lowest of the major cancer sites and this rate has not improved
      significantly in recent decades [38,75,76]. The disease kills one
      person every hour – more people than cervical cancer, Hodgkin's
      disease, or malignant melanoma [38]. Notably, incidence in young
      adults (&lt;40 years) is increasing in the U.S. [8,10] and
      worldwide [9,77]. The World Health Organization predicts a
      continuing worldwide increase in oral cancer over the next several
      decades [78].<br>
      <br>
      Early detection followed by appropriate treatment, increases cure
      rates to about 80%, and greatly improves the quality of life by
      minimizing extensive, debilitating treatments [75]. Oral cancer is
      asymptomatic in its early stages, however, and in spite of the
      accessibility of the oral cavity to direct examination, these
      malignancies are often not detected until a late stage [79-81].
      Oral cancer is unusual in that it carries a high risk of second
      primary tumors. Patients who survive a first cancer of the oral
      cavity have up to a 20-fold increased risk of developing a second
      primary oral cancer. The heightened risk can last 5–10 years,
      sometimes longer [82].<br>
      <br>
      In response to the difficulties in effectively treating oral
      cancer, research studies are focusing on prevention and early
      diagnostics. Some of these studies have found that OSCC lesions
      are colonized by an altered microbiota [83,84]. Other
      investigations have found bacterial DNA or live organisms within
      oral cancer tissues [85,86]. The true nature of the relationships
      between oral bacteria and oral or esophageal cancers is, however,
      currently unknown.<br>
      <br>
      PCR techniques have been used to seek the DNA of bacterial species
      in head and neck cancer tissues. Sasaki et al. [85] found S.
      anginosus DNA sequences in tissue samples from 127 cancer
      patients. Tissues examined included esophageal cancer, gastric
      cancer tissues, and dysplasia of the esophagus from esophageal
      cancer patients. No S. anginosus DNA was found in noncancerous
      esophagus or stomach samples. However, the degree of S. anginosus
      infection in biopsied tissues was much more obvious in the
      dysplastic and cancerous sections than in the noncancerous
      portions of the esophagus suggesting that S. anginosus infection
      occurred at an early stage of esophageal cancer. The authors
      suggested that S. anginosus could play a significant role in the
      carcinogenic process of most cases of esophageal cancer and some
      cases of gastric cancer by causing inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      Morita et al. [86] found that 8 of 18 (44%) samples from the
      esophagus contained a detectable level of S. anginosus DNA, but
      only 5 of 38 (13%) of oral cancer had detectable DNA levels of
      this organism. The quantity of S. anginosus DNA in the esophageal
      cancer tissues was significantly higher than in oral cancer. The
      maximum amount of S. anginosus DNA was approximately 10 times
      higher in esophageal than in oral cancer tissues. In addition,
      none of the 5 different oral cancer sites (floor of mouth,
      maxillary or mandibular gingiva, buccal mucosa, and tongue) showed
      significant signs of S. anginosus infection. Most non-cancerous
      tissues of the esophagus and tongue showed an undetectable level
      of S. anginosus. The authors concluded that S. anginosus is
      associated with esophageal cancer, but is not closely related with
      oral cancer.<br>
      <br>
      In a previous study by Mager et al. [87] it was determined that
      the salivary microbiota was similar to that of the oral soft
      tissues. Therefore, the investigators examined whether the
      salivary counts of 40 common oral bacteria in subjects with an
      oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) lesion would differ from those
      found in cancer-free (OSCC-free) controls [83]. Unstimulated
      saliva samples were collected from 229 OSCC-free and 45 OSCC
      subjects and evaluated for their content of 40 common oral
      bacteria using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.<br>
      <br>
      DNA counts per ml saliva were determined for each species,
      averaged across subjects in the 2 subject groups, and the
      significance of differences between groups determined using the
      Mann-Whitney test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. The
      diagnostic sensitivity and specificity in detection of OSCC by
      levels of salivary organisms were computed and comparisons made
      separately between a non-matched group of 45 OSCC subjects and 229
      controls and a group of 45 OSCC subjects and 45 controls matched
      by age, gender and smoking history.<br>
      <br>
      Counts of 3 of the 40 species tested, Capnocytophaga gingivalis,
      Prevotella melaninogenica and Streptococcus mitis, were elevated
      in the saliva of individuals with OSCC (p &lt; 0.001). When tested
      as diagnostic markers the 3 species were found to predict 80% of
      cancer cases (sensitivity) while excluding 83% of controls
      (specificity) in the non-matched group. Diagnostic sensitivity and
      specificity in the matched group were 80% and 82% respectively.
      These findings suggest that high salivary counts of C. gingivalis,
      P. melaninogenica and S. mitis could be diagnostic indicators of
      OSCC.<br>
      <br>
      The reasons for the differences in colonization patterns of
      specific bacterial species at different host locations are only
      partially understood. These reasons include differences in
      nutrient availability, competition among species for binding
      sites, inter-species antagonisms or cooperations, and the
      differences in receptors present on different tissues that permit
      binding by specific adhesins possessed by different species. Other
      factors that may partly explain the unfavorable microbial shifts
      observed in oral carcinoma surface biofilms are a compromised host
      response or the irregularity of the lesion surface providing
      stagnant habitats.<br>
      <br>
      The most intensely studied of these possibilities has been the
      specificity in adhesion of different bacterial species to
      receptors on oral soft tissues. Many studies have focused on
      fimbriae-mediated adhesion and adhesins in the adherence of
      different oral species to oral epithelial cells [88-91]. As a
      universal trait of cancer cells is alterations in cell surface
      receptors, studies have examined the colonization of healthy and
      cancerous epithelia [83,85-87,92].<br>
      <br>
      A study by Neeser et al. [92] examined the binding of a common
      oral bacterial species, Streptococcus sanguis OMZ 9 to healthy and
      cancerous buccal cell lines. Results showed that S. sanguis bound
      to exfoliated human buccal epithelial cells in a sialic
      acid-sensitive manner. The desialylation of such cells invariably
      abolished adhesion of S. sanguis to the epithelial cell surface.
      The resialylation of desialylated HBEC with CMP-sialic acid and
      Galß1,3GalNAc α2,3-sialyltransferase specific for O-glycans
      restores the receptor function for S. sanguis OMZ 9, whereas a
      similar cell resialylation with the Galß1,4GlcNAc
      α2,6-sialyltmnsferase specific for N-glycans is without effect.
      These findings suggested that a 23 kDa cell surface glycoprotein
      bearing a carbohydrate sequence, NeuNAc alpha 2-3Gal beta
      1-3GalNAc O-linked sugar chains, is recognized by S. sanguis on
      exfoliated human buccal epithelial cells. In similar experiments
      carried out with a buccal carcinoma cell line termed SqCC/Y1, S.
      sanguis did not attach in great numbers to cultured tumor cells.
      These cells were shown to not express the membrane glycoprotein
      bearing alpha 2,3-sialylated O-linked carbohydrate chains.<br>
      <br>
      Aberrations in the cell surface carbohydrate structures have now
      been established as a universal characteristic of malignant
      transformation of cells, and cancer has been referred to as a
      molecular disease of the cell membrane glycoconjugates [93,94].
      Thus, changes in the tumor cell surface structure could alter the
      adhesion of different species of oral bacteria. Notably, even
      species within the same genera, such as streptococci, have been
      found to differ in their colonization of healthy and cancerous
      oral tissues [83,87].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bacteria and the prevention or treatment of cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Evidence is mounting that certain species of bacteria or their
      toxins may indeed have a protective or curative role in some
      cancers. Factors that would suggest a protective role of a
      bacterial species include: (1) colonization lowers the risk of a
      certain cancer; (2) elimination or absence of colonization raises
      the risk, or (3) introduction of the bacteria or its toxins cures
      or causes remission of the cancer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tumors and coley's toxins</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Spontaneous tumor regression has followed severe bacterial,
      fungal, viral and protozoal infections. For hundreds of years this
      phenomenon inspired the development of the earliest cancer
      therapies. Reports of spontaneous remissions of advanced cancers
      infections can be found in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
      centuries. Many of these unexplained cures followed bacterial
      infections accompanied by high fevers.<br>
      <br>
      An American surgeon, Dr. William Coley began the first
      well-documented use of bacteria and their toxins to treat end
      stage cancers. Coley first used live Streptococcus pyogenes
      cultures. Problems with the predictability of patient responses
      caused him to develop a safer vaccine in the late 1800's composed
      of two killed bacterial species, S. pyogenes and Serratia
      marcescens. In this way he could simulate an infection with the
      accompanying fever without the risk of an actual infection
      [95,96].<br>
      <br>
      Coley's vaccine was widely used to successfully treat sarcomas,
      carcinomas, lymphomas, melanomas and myelomas. Complete, prolonged
      regression of advanced malignancy was documented in many cases.
      The combined reports of Coley and others estimated the 5-year
      survival rate at 80% in malignancies for which no treatment
      existed. Even in patients considered in the terminal stages of
      cancer some remarkable recoveries were reported with the patient
      often outliving the cancer [97].<br>
      <br>
      Coley considered 4 points critical to success: (1) initiation of a
      naturally occurring infection with fever, (2) avoidance of immune
      tolerance by gradually increasing the dosage, (3) directly
      injecting the vaccine into the tumor when accessible, and (4) a
      minimum of 6 months of injections to avoid recurrences. Today
      little credence is given to the febrile response in fighting
      cancer [96,97].<br>
      <br>
      A retrospective study was conducted in 1999 to compare the 10 year
      survival rate of patients treated by Coley's vaccine with modern
      conventional therapies. Richardson et al. [95] tried to match 128
      of Coley's cases with 1,675 controls from the Surveillance
      Epidemiology End Result (SEER) cancer registry. The 2 populations
      were matched by age, gender, ethnicity, stage and radiation
      treatment status. Limitations included sample size and staging of
      patients receiving Coley's vaccine. The authors concluded that
      "Given the tremendous advances in surgical techniques and medicine
      in general, any cohort of modern patients should be expected to
      fare better than patients treated 50 or more years ago. Yet no
      such statistical advantage for the modern group was observed in
      this study." These findings were supported by case reports of
      spontaneous remissions or significant benefits when accidental
      infections occurred [98-100].<br>
      <br>
      What role may a febrile response play in the remission of a tumor?
      Hobohm [101] offers the following hypothesis. Fever causes a
      cascade of events of inflammatory factors which activate resting
      dendritic cells (DC) that lead to the activation of T-cells.
      Cancer-cell specific T-cells usually remain in a state of anergy,
      most likely due to the absence of danger signals that usually
      accompany tissue destruction and inflammation upon acute infection
      [102]. A feverish bacterial infection may have a 3-fold beneficial
      effect. First, many infectious agents release endotoxins, like
      LPS, induce inflammatory cytokines and stimulate DC. Second, both
      thymocyte proliferation and generation of allo-specific CTL are
      increased with temperature in vitro [103]. Third, the vasculature
      of a tumor is more fragile than that of normal tissues and
      therefore more prone to destruction by the immune response. An
      infection causing hemorrhagic necrosis could trigger febrile
      collapse of the tumor vasculature [104,105]. Interestingly, the
      affinity of certain streptococci for binding to fibrinogen and
      fibrin may account for the 'homing' of bacterial enzymes to tumors
      as these cells are abundant in such proteins [106].<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism by which infection cures cancer has been
      investigated. It has been suggested by Zacharski and Sukhatme [96]
      that the tumor regression observed by Coley and others is due to
      the activation of plasminogen. For example when the streptococcal
      spreading factor known as streptokinase (SK) combines with host
      plasminogen, plasmin is released. Plasmin triggers protease
      cascades that degrade plasma and extracellular matrix proteins.
      These mechanisms of degradation are toxic to tumor cells, disrupt
      the tumor extracellular matrix, alter tumor growth and inhibit
      metastasis [96]. The notion that plasminogen activators like SK
      might result in the remissions reported by Coley is appealing as
      they appear to spare healthy cells while attacking tumors.
      Zacharski et al. [107] hypothesized that although the potent
      enzymes produced by plasminogen activation may have a direct
      effect on cancer cells it was more likely they disrupted the
      cell-extracellular matrix of the tumor.<br>
      <br>
      Investigators report that the traditional best treatment options
      for some candidate tumor types, such as advanced soft tissue
      sarcomas, breast cancer and melanoma, have not improved patient
      outcome substantially since Coley's day [96,108,109]. Currently,
      biologic response modifier therapies have moved beyond the
      nonspecific immunotherapy of Coley's era and laid the foundation
      for today's approaches. Zarcharski and Sukhatme [96] suggest that
      the early success of Coley's toxins are leading to therapies that
      engage the host's immune system against an individual's tumor
      offering new hope for cancer patients.<br>
      <br>
      Autologous tumor cell vaccine therapy is an example of this new
      approach to cancer treatment. These vaccines differ markedly from
      conventional cytotoxic drug therapy that affect both normal and
      tumor cells. Tumor vaccines stimulate an individual's
      cell-mediated immune response by targeting the patient's tumor
      antigens. While efficacy of standard chemotherapy relates to the
      dose of the drug, the efficacy of a tumor vaccine is more complex,
      involving host-vaccine interactions [110]. These include: (1)
      immunogenicity of the vaccine regarding tumor-associated antigens
      as opposed to self; (2) the host's immune response in terms of
      immune recognition and effector mechanisms; and (3) the
      development of host systemic cell-mediated immunity, including
      long-term immunologic memory, (3–5 years). Therefore, the potency
      of the vaccine is not determined by immunogenicity alone but by
      its ability to induce the host anti-tumor response [110].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Bacillus calmette-guérin and autologous tumor cell vaccine vs.
        colon cancer</b><br>
      <br>
      Certain tumor antigens are, however, normally weak immunogens.
      Therefore the use of adjuvants and the intradermal route of
      injection have, in some cases, produced an optimum antigenic
      vaccine. These adjuvant vaccines have induced effective host
      recognition of tumor-associated antigens and improved patient
      survival. For example, preliminary evidence by Hoover et al [111]
      suggested that active specific immunotherapy (ASI) of colon cancer
      using autologous tumor cell vaccines had potential in improving
      recurrence-free interval and survival. ASI assumes there are
      distinct tumor antigens on an individual's cancer cells that are
      either absent or in lower concentration on normal cells. The
      vaccine attempted to stimulate host's immune defenses against
      tumor-associated antigens by enhancing the immunogenicity of the
      patient's own tumor cells with an immunomodulating adjuvant, such
      as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG).<br>
      <br>
      In a study by Hoover et al. [111] 80 eligible subjects with colon
      (47) or rectal (33) cancer were enrolled into a prospectively
      randomized, controlled clinical trial of active specific
      immunotherapy (ASI). An autologous tumor cell-Bacillus Calmette-
      Guerin (BCG) vaccine was used to determine whether ASI could
      improve disease- free status and survival. Eligible subjects had
      colon or rectal cancers extending through the bowel wall or had
      positive lymph nodes providing adequate cells from the primary
      tumor. Wide surgical removal of all tumors was performed with
      histologically proven clear margins and removal of involved lymph
      nodes. Prior to randomization individuals were screened for
      metastatic disease. Colon cancer and rectal cancer subjects were
      in separate but parallel studies and randomized into groups
      treated by resection alone or resection plus ASI. 3–4 weeks
      following surgery, both controls and treatment subjects were skin
      tested for immune competence and sensitivity to tuberculin
      purified protein derivative (PPD). Vaccines were begun in the ASI
      treatment group 4–5 weeks following surgery to allow for adequate
      immune recovery from surgery and anesthesia. A total of 24 colon
      and 17 rectal subjects composed the treatment group. With a median
      follow-up of 93 months, there was a significant improvement in
      survival (two-sided P = .02; hazards ratio, 3.97) and disease-free
      survival (two-sided P = .039; hazards ratio, 2.67) in all eligible
      colon cancer patients who received ASI. With a median follow-up of
      58 months, no benefits were seen in patients with rectal cancer
      who received ASI. The authors concluded that the study suggested
      that ASI may be beneficial to patients with colon cancer.<br>
      <br>
      In 2005, Uyl-de Groot et al. [110] conducted a multicenter,
      randomized controlled phase III clinical trial with Stage II and
      III colon cancer patients using ASI. Autologous tumor cells were
      used with the immunomodulating adjuvant Bacillus Calmette-Guérin
      (BCG) in a vaccine (OncoVAX®). Patients were randomized to receive
      either OncoVAX® or no therapy after surgical resection of the
      primary tumor. The vaccine was processed within 48 h after surgery
      in order to have viable, metabolically active, autologous tumor
      cells.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of prognostic benefit with a 5.8 year median follow-up,
      showed that the beneficial effects of OncoVAX® were statistically
      significant at all endpoints including recurrence-free interval,
      overall survival, and recurrence-free survival in Stage II colon
      cancer patients. Surgery alone cures 65% of Stage II colon cancer
      patients. For the remaining patients, OncoVAX® in an adjuvant
      setting significantly prolongs recurrence-free interval and
      significantly improves 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free
      survival. Unfortunately, no statistically significant prognostic
      benefits were achieved in Stage III patients [110].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Immunization with bacillus calmette-guérin vs. lung cancer</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Grant et al [39] hypothesized that optimal chemotherapy with or
      without radiation followed by active immunization could eliminate
      microscopic residual disease and prolong survival. Immunization
      with GD3, a ganglioside expressed on the surface of most small
      cell lung cancers (SCLC) had not evoked a strong immune response.
      Therefore BEC2, a large xenogenic protein which mimics GD3, was
      judged to be a good immunogenic candidate. This approach had
      proven successful in extending the lives of melanoma patients
      [112].<br>
      <br>
      Chapman et al. [113] conducted a phase II trial comparing 5 dose
      levels of BEC2. The study population consisted of 15 patients with
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC). All subjects had completed standard
      therapy and had achieved a partial or complete response. Patients
      received a series of five intradermal immunizations consisting of
      2.5 mg of BEC2 plus BCG over a 10-week period. Blood was collected
      for serological analysis, and outcome was monitored. All patients
      developed anti-BEC2 antibodies, despite having received
      chemotherapy with or without thoracic radiation. Anti-GD3
      antibodies were detected in five patients, including those with
      the longest relapse-free survival. The median relapse-free
      survival for patients with extensive stage disease was 10.6
      months. In patients with limited stage disease a median
      relapse-free survival had not been reached with a follow-up of
      &gt;47 months and only one of the 7 patients in this group
      relapsed. The authors reported that immunization of SCLC patients
      using BEC2 plus BCG after standard therapy could induce anti-GD3
      antibodies and was safe. The survival and relapse-free survival in
      this group of patients was substantially better than those
      observed in similar patients receiving standard therapy.<br>
      <br>
      A Phase III trial was conducted to evaluate BEC2 plus BCG as
      adjuvant therapy for limited small-cell carcinoma after
      chemotherapy and irradiation [114]. A total of 515 subjects were
      randomly assigned. Unfortunately, in this trial there was no
      improvement in survival, progression-free survival, or quality of
      life in subjects that were vaccinated. A trend toward prolonged
      survival was observed in the one third of subjects who developed a
      humoral response (p = 0.085), however.<br>
      <br>
      The effectiveness of vaccines for several cancers was examined in
      a series of investigations. Xiang et al. [115] tested vaccines for
      human melanoma using the mutant S. typhi strain SL7207 as a DNA
      carrier. Tolerance against self-antigens was broken by genetically
      fusing ubiquitin with MHC I derivatives. Another approach coupled
      tumor-specific antibodies to functional IL-2. This combination in
      addition to oral vaccination with plasmid-encoded tumor antigens
      significantly enhanced protection against carcinoma of the colon
      [116], carcinoma of the lung [117] and melanoma [118]. Unstable
      cancer cells provided a challenge, however. Interestingly, this
      was overcome by targeting stable, proliferating endothelial cells
      of the tumor vasculature. This novel approach effectively
      inhibited angiogenesis [119].<br>
      <br>
      <b>Helicobacter pylori and esophageal adenocarcinoma</b><br>
      <br>
      In industrialized countries the incidence of H pylori has been
      steadily decreasing [120]. The incidence of esophageal cancer
      (EA), however, is increasing [121]. Surprisingly, there is
      evidence that these two trends may be related. Several studies
      have determined that virulent strains of H pylori are found less
      commonly among patients with Barrett's esophagus and EA when
      compared with controls [122-124]. This led to studies that found
      positive associations among the increased incidence of obesity,
      GORD, Barrett's esophagus and EA [125].<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a nested case-control study was conducted by de Martel
      et al [126] to assess the association between H. pylori infection
      and the risk of development of EA. Of a total of 128,992 members
      of an integrated health care system who had participated in a
      multiphasic health checkup (MHC) during 1964–1969, 52 patients
      developed EA during follow-up. Three randomly chosen control
      subjects from the MHC cohort were matched to each cancer subject,
      on the basis of age, gender, race, date and site of the MHC. Data
      on cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI),
      and education level were obtained. Serum samples collected at the
      MHC were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori and to the H.
      pylori CagA antigen associated with H. pylori virulence.<br>
      <br>
      Subjects with H. pylori infections were less likely than
      uninfected subjects to develop EA odds ratio (OR, 0.37) 95%
      confidence interval (CI, 0.16–0.88). This significant association
      was restricted to cancer subjects and control subjects &lt;50
      years old (OR, 0.20) (95% CI, 0.06–0.68). Interestingly, in
      patients with H. pylori infections, the OR for EA in those who
      tested positive for IgG antibodies to the CagA protein was similar
      to that for those who tested negative for it. BMI ≥25 and
      cigarette smoking, however, were strong independent risk factors
      for EA. The authors found, however, that the absence of H. pylori
      infection, independent of cigarette smoking and BMI, was
      associated with an increase in the risk of development of EA
      [126].<br>
      <br>
      An epidemiological study in Sweden sought to determine whether BMI
      was associated with esophageal malignancies compared to gastric
      adenocarcinoma and controls. In a nationwide, population-based
      case-control study by Lagergren et al [127], between 1995 through
      1997, a total of 189 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus
      and 262 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia were
      enrolled. These patients were compared with 167 patients with
      incident esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and 820 healthy
      controls.<br>
      <br>
      Odds ratios were determined from BMI and cancer case-control
      status and ratios estimated the relative risk for the two
      adenocarcinomas studied. Calculations used multivariate logistic
      regression with adjustment for potential confounding factors. The
      adjusted odds ratio was 7.6 (95% CI, 3.8 to 15.2) among persons in
      the highest BMI quartile compared with persons in the lowest.
      Obese persons (persons with a BMI&gt;30 kg/m2) had an odds ratio
      of 16.2 (CI, 6.3 to 41.4) compared with the leanest persons
      (persons with a BMI&lt;22 kg/m2). The odds ratio for patients with
      cardia adenocarcinoma was 2.3 (CI, 1.5 to 3.6) in those in the
      highest BMI quartile compared with those in the lowest BMI
      quartile and 4.3 (CI, 2.1 to 8.7) among obese persons. Although a
      strong dose-dependent relation existed between BMI and esophageal
      adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma was not
      associated with BMI. A modest but significant increase in
      intragastric acidity was also observed following the cure of H
      pylori infection which the authors postulated could contribute to
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD).<br>
      <br>
      The incidence of EA has increased rapidly over the last 30 years.
      During this period, the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori has
      decreased. Trends of increasing esophageal adenocarcinoma can be
      linked causally to increasing GORD which can be linked to an
      increasingly obese population. There appeared to be no plausible
      biological mechanism of association between H pylori, obesity, and
      GORD until studies of ghrelin, however.<br>
      <br>
      Ghrelin was the first circulating hormone demonstrated to
      stimulate food intake in man. This peptide is produced in the
      stomach and regulates appetite, food intake, and body composition.
      The effects of ghrelin were examined in H pylori positive
      asymptomatic subjects by several investigators [128-130]. In a
      randomized double-blind cross-over study, by Wren et al. [129],
      ghrelin was shown to acutely enhance appetite and increase food
      intake in 9 healthy human subjects. There was a clear-cut increase
      in calories consumed by every individual from a free-choice buffet
      (mean increase 28 +/- 3.9%, p &lt; 0.001) during ghrelin versus
      saline infusions. Furthermore, visual analogue scores for appetite
      were greater during ghrelin compared to saline infusion. Ghrelin
      had no effect on gastric emptying, however. The authors concluded
      that endogenous ghrelin was a potentially important new regulator
      of the complex systems controlling food intake and body weight.<br>
      <br>
      Evidence is accumulating that ghrelin may explain the relative
      rarity of H. pylori among patients with Barrett's esophagus and
      EA. Findings from these studies and others support the notion that
      H. pylori may have a "protective" effect against EA [122,124].
      Studies have found that curing H pylori infection increased plasma
      ghrelin in healthy asymptomatic subjects which may lead to
      increased appetite, weight gain and contribute to the increasing
      obesity seen in Western populations where the prevalence of H
      pylori is low. This evidence supports the notion that decreasing
      incidence of H pylori infection may lead to increased levels of
      plasma ghrelin and that this hormone appears to be a factor in
      increasing obesity which elevates the risk of GORD which is
      positively associated with Barrett's esophagus and increased risk
      of esophageal adenocarcinoma. It appears that the absence of H.
      pylori infection may be one of several factors that leads to the
      increased incidence in EA effect observed in Western populations.<br>
      <br>
      The implications for treatment of individuals with H. pylori
      infection were addressed by Nakajima and Hattori [131]. They
      systematically reviewed the literature and estimated the expected
      annual incidence of esophageal or gastric cancer with and without
      eradication of H. pylori infection in patients with chronic
      atrophic gastritis. The expected annual incidence of gastric
      cancer in patients with corpus atrophy with persistent infection
      was at least 5.8-fold higher than that for esophageal
      adenocarcinoma after the eradication of infection at all ages.
      Even for patients with accompanying reflux esophagitis or
      Barrett's esophagus, the incidence of gastric adenocarcinoma with
      persistent infection was higher than that of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma after eradication of infection. The authors
      concluded, therefore, that if eradication of infection lowers the
      incidence of gastric cancer, it should be recommended for patients
      with corpus atrophy at all ages irrespective of the presence of
      reflux esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, especially in
      populations having a high prevalence of gastric cancer [131].<br>
      <br>
      In summary, increased BMI has been linked with the elimination of
      H. pylori infection. As the sphincter mechanism at the
      esophagogastric junction is weakened by weight it is not
      surprising that obese individuals have a higher incidence of
      gastric reflux or GORD [127]. GORD may lead to the development of
      Barrett's esophagus, which increases the risk of EA by 40-fold
      [132,133]. The study by Lagergren [127] provides evidence that
      these associations may be related as increasing body mass was
      associated with a stepwise increase in the risk of EA. If
      eradication of H. pylori infection lowers the incidence of gastric
      cancer, however, it should be recommended for patients with corpus
      atrophy at all ages irrespective of the presence of reflux
      esophagitis or Barrett's esophagus, especially in populations
      having a high prevalence of gastric cancer [131].<br>
      Attenuated bacteria: Promising carriers of DNA vaccines<br>
      <br>
      Attenuated bacteria will enhance stimulation of the innate immune
      system yet increase the safety of a vaccine, [134] therefore they
      may be ideal for the delivery of vaccines. Animal studies have
      shown that attenuated S. typhimurium strains can successfully
      deliver a variety of genetically engineered DNA vaccine plasmids
      for therapeutic vaccination of mice against model tumors
      [117,118,135].<br>
      <br>
      The identification of bacterial "carriers" for DNA vaccines that
      target cancer cells by site-specific colonization may allow the
      selective delivery of vaccine plasmids into tumor cells [136].
      Colonization of these species may be considered coincidental to
      favorable conditions provided by the tumor yet prove clinically
      useful. Ultimately, however, the safety and efficacy of
      recombinant therapeutic agents expressed by plasmids must be
      conducted in appropriate animal models.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      Cancer is commonly defined as the uncontrolled growth of abnormal
      cells that have accumulated enough DNA damage to be freed from the
      normal restraints of the cell cycle. Several pathogenic bacteria,
      particularly those that can establish a persistent, infection, can
      promote or initiate abnormal cell growth by evading the immune
      system or suppressing apoptosis [54,137]. Intracellular pathogens
      survive by evading the ability of the host to identify them as
      foreign. Other species or their toxins can alter host cell cycles
      or stimulate the production of inflammatory substances linked to
      DNA damage [120].<br>
      <br>
      The highly site-specific adherence of bacteria involves binding
      species-specific adhesions to the required cell surface receptors.
      The role of species that colonize tumors could be causal,
      coincidental or potentially protective. If adhesion to the tumor
      in question is highly sensitive and specific it may be ideal not
      only in diagnosing the presence of a malignancy but also in
      delivering the appropriate therapy.<br>
      <br>
      The bacterial species associated with cancer etiology are diverse;
      however, the infections they cause share common characteristics
      [18]. The time between acquiring the infection and cancer
      development is most often years or even decades as seen in cancers
      associated with H. pylori, S. typhi and S. bovis infections.
      Chronic interactions between the infective agent and immune
      response and/or a susceptible host appear to contribute to
      carcinogenesis [8,18,38,138]. Preventing or treating the infection
      may prevent the cancer in question. Notably, the vast majority of
      individuals infected with a cancer-causing species will not
      develop cancer [18].<br>
      <br>
      Evidence suggests that certain individuals are more susceptible to
      infections linked to cancer development and that the incidence of
      certain cancers varies among populations. For example, gallbladder
      cancer is 3 times higher in females as in males in all populations
      [26]. Lung cancer is highest in populations that smoke however,
      only a small proportion of smokers develop lung cancer [42].
      Although colon cancer is the 3rd highest cancer in the United
      States, individuals with IBD have a far greater risk of colorectal
      cancer than individuals without IBD [56-58].<br>
      <br>
      A screening test for oral cancer based on salivary counts of
      bacterial species is appealing. Currently saliva is meeting the
      demand for inexpensive, non-invasive, and easy-to-use diagnostic
      aids for oral and systemic diseases, and for assessing risk
      behaviors such as tobacco and alcohol use. Although the
      colonization of certain bacterial species may be coincidental to
      favorable conditions provided by OSCC, increased numbers of
      certain salivary species may be clinically useful if shown to be a
      signature of oral cancer and if sensitivity and specificity are
      improved.<br>
      <br>
      Successful treatment for cancers was reported by Dr. Coley and
      others one hundred years ago. His approach of using killed
      bacterial vaccines was surprisingly effective in some patients
      even in the latest stages of cancer. Dr. Coley believed that the
      human immune system had the power to cure cancers if properly
      stimulated. Today, some investigators agree and have designed new
      treatments that stimulate the immune system to recognize and
      target the lesion. Recent reports suggest that attenuated
      bacterial vaccines can safely and effectively deliver plasmids
      encoding tumor self antigens. These studies have reported
      successful treatment of certain cancers and prevention of
      recurrences [39,110,111]. Cancer vaccines although promising,
      present significant challenges. These include identification of
      highly effective bacterial strains and their attenuations,
      addressing safety issues and the problem of overcoming the
      peripheral T cell tolerance against tumor self-antigens [139].
      Further, the response to vaccines will likely vary among
      individuals.<br>
      <br>
      It appears that colonization by certain bacteria may reduce the
      risk of cancer in some populations. The epidemiological trends of
      esophageal adenocarcinoma and Helicobacter pylori infection have
      stimulated research into whether these may be coincidental or due
      to an inverse association. Intriguing results suggest there is an
      association represented by a complex continuum that begins with
      curing infections of virulent strains of H. pylori. The absence of
      H. pylori appears to elevate ghrelin which stimulates increased
      appetite in some individuals. High ghrelin levels appear to be
      associated with increased incidence of obesity. Obesity is
      reported to be a contributing factor in GORD. Finally, GORD may
      lead to Barrett's esophagus which increases the risk of esophageal
      adenocarcinoma. If these relationships can be proven, then the
      colonization of this species and its seemingly negative
      association with EA may be more clearly understood.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, recent research has uncovered a great deal of
      information regarding the bacterial mechanisms used to cause,
      colonize or cure cancer, however, many questions remain. For
      example, do the bacteria in question initiate, promote, or merely
      show affinity for the neoplasm? Conversely does cancer weaken the
      host which facilitates acquiring the infection? Can the highly
      site specific colonization of certain bacteria for a tumor be
      clinically useful in diagnosis or treatment? Could attenuated
      bacteria be used in vaccines to safely and effectively deliver
      therapeutic agents? The continued exploration of these questions
      will bring research ever closer to the prevention, early diagnosis
      and truly effective treatment of this scourge of mankind. <br>
