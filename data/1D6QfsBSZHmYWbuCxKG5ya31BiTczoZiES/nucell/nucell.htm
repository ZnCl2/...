    <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A radioisotope
        electric power system developed by inventor Paul Brown is a
        scientific breakthrough in nuclear power. The battery utilizes
        the energy given off by decaying radioactive material,
        converting it directly into a continuous AC electrical current.
        Unlike conventional nuclear generating devices, the power cell
        does not rely on a nuclear reaction or chemical process and does
        not produce radioactive waste products.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Brown's first prototype
          power cell produced 100,000 times as much energy per gram of
          strontium-90 (the energy source) than the most powerful
          thermal nuclear battery yet in existence. The Nucell battery
          yielded 7500 watts per gram of strontium-90. Compare this to
          an advanced device recently developed by the US Dept. of
          Energy Byproducts Utilization Program. Their state-of-the-art
          thermal nuclear battery produced 0.063 watts per gram of
          strontium-90.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The key to the Nucell
          battery is Brown's discovery of a method to harness the
          magnetic energy given off by the alpha and beta particles
          inherent in nuclear material. Alpha and beta particles are
          produced by the radioactive decay of certain naturally
          occurring and man-made nuclear material (radionuclides).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electric charges of the
          alpha and beta particles have been captured and converted to
          electricity for existing nuclear batteries, but the amount of
          power generated from such batteries has been very small. Alpha
          and beta particles also possess kinetic energy by successive
          collisions of the particles with air molecules or other
          molecules. The bulk of the R&amp;D of nuclear batteries in the
          past has been concerned with this heat energy which is readily
          observable and measurable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The magnetic energy given
          off by alpha and beta particles is several orders of magnitude
          greater than either the kinetic energy or the direct electric
          energy produced by these same particles. However, the myriads
          of tiny magnetic fields existing at any tie cannot be
          individually recognized or measured. This energy is not
          captured locally in nature to produce heat or mechanical
          effects, but instead the energy escapes undetected. Brown has
          invented a way to "organize" these magnetic fields so the
          great amounts of otherwise unobservable energy could be
          harnessed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The weight of the
          strontium-90 used to generate 75 watts of power in the Nucell
          prototype is approximately the same as the weight of 2
          millimeters of wire cut off the end of a small paper clip.
          Projected sizes of the Nucell battery will range from the size
          of a soup can to the size of a small barrel or waste can for a
          50 kilowatt model.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The alpha and beta particles
          utilized in the Nucell battery have a limited ability to
          penetrate matter; alpha particles can be contained by a piece
          of paper; beta particles require 0.03" of aluminum. The Nucell
          battery is housed in a stainless steel, high-vacuum container,
          making it a safe, impermeable source of power.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In summary, alpha and beta
          decay are electrically charged particles expelled from the
          nucleus at near-light velocities. Any moving charged particle
          yields a magnetic field, in which energy is stored, that is
          carried along with it. The absorption of this charged particle
          causes the magnetic field to collapse and this produces an
          emf. The energy yielded from this field collapse is enormous
          and is called the alpha or beta voltaic effect.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The resonant nuclear battery
          is an LCR resonant tank circuit oscillating at its
          self-resonant frequency with energy contributed by the beta
          voltaic effect. The energy contributed to the tank, in excess
          of the circuit losses, must be removed through a high Q
          transformer impedance matched to the circuit. The result is a
          means for converting alpha and/or beta decay energy directly
          and efficiently into electricity, with a life expectancy
          determined by the half-life of the radioactive fuel used.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any radioisotope in the form
          of a solid that gives off alpha or beta particles can be
          utilized in the new power cell. The first cell constructed
          (that melted the wire components) employed the most powerful
          source known, radium-226, as the energy source. However,
          radium 226 gives rise through decay to the daughter product
          bismuth-214, which gives off strong gamma radiation that
          requires shielding for safety. This adds a weight penalty in
          mobile applications.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Radium-226 is a naturally
          occurring isotope which is formed very slowly by the decay of
          uranim-238. Radium-226 in equilibrium is present at about 1
          gram per 3 million grams of uranium in the earth's crust.
          Uranium mill wastes are a readily available source of
          radium-226 in very abundant quantities.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Uranium mill wastes contain
          far more energy in the radium-226 than is represented by the
          fission energy derived from the produced uranium.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Strontium-90 gives off no
          gamma radiation so it does not necessitate the use of thick
          lead shielding for safety. Strontium-90 does not exist in
          nature, but it is one of the several radioactive waste
          products resulting from nuclear fission. The utilizable energy
          from strontium-90 substantially exceeds the energy derived
          from the nuclear fission which gave rise to this isotope.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once the present stores of
          nuclear wastes have been mined, the future supplies of
          strontium-90 will depend on the amount of nuclear electricity
          generated. Hence strontium-90 decay may ultimately become a
          premium fuel for such special uses as for perpetually powered
          wheel chairs and portable computers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The most difficult problems
          in managing nuclear wastes are handling the great amount of
          heat generated by alpha and beta emitters and isolating the
          alpha and beta emmitters' biosphere. Virtually all other alpha
          and beta emitters in nuclear fission wastes can be employed in
          the new power cells. Hence these no longer constitute wastes
          but have become valuable energy assets.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Peripheral Systems Inc., a
          diversified technology firm based in Portland OR, has begun
          developing a production model of an extremely compact and
          highly efficient nuclear "battery" --- actually a
          radioisotopic generator --- that could help meet the
          military's need for a long-lasting power source in remote
          locations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unlike existing
          radioactivity-powered generators, the patented Nucell resonant
          nuclear battery (RNB) converts decaying radioactive material
          directly into electricity without first converting it to heat.
          A prototype about the size of a soup can generated up to 70
          watts of power.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Production of Nucell
          batteries, the size of a D-cell battery and producing one to
          five watts with a 3 to 5 year lifespan. Could begin by year's
          end, according to Paul Brown, vice president of R&amp;D and
          inventor of the device.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The small-scale dynamos
          could be used for powering underwater listening devices used
          in tracking submarine, and in generating electricity for
          satellites dedicated to command, control, communications and
          intelligence. They also would be ideal for other types of
          space duty, such as remote-sensing satellites widely used by
          NASA and various foreign governments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For these and similar
          applications, the Nucell battery will be capable of providing
          continuous electric power for 5 to 10 years.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chemical-type batteries,
          with their relatively short lifespan, and the less efficient
          radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) are now used in
          such applications. In these ordinary nuclear batteries, the
          nuclei of the radioisotopes normally used (like plutonium)
          emit their radiation in the form of alpha or beta particles.
          As the particles fly from the nuclei, they crash into other
          particles and nuclei, creating heat in the process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Most nuclear batteries
          exploit this heat by using materials&nbsp; --- thermocouples
          --- that generate electrical currents from differences in
          temperature. Such "thermoelectric generators" are reliable,
          but their efficiency leaves much to be desired.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The best RTGs in use manage
          to turn only about 5% of the available heat into electricity.
          Their output is usually less than 100 watts --- just enough to
          energize a light bulb.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Nucell RNB, on the other
          hand, is much more efficient because it exploits the particles
          themselves, not the heat they shed. "Independent and
          peripheral-sponsored tests indicate we are getting more than
          25% conversion efficiency", says Brown.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An earlier generation of
          nuclear batteries much larger than the Nucell was used aboard
          the Apollo spacecraft and produced 70 watts of power from the
          heat given off by more than 8 pounds of plutonium. Brown says
          the Nucell produces the same power using substantially less
          radioactive material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"As a potential fuel for the
          Nucell battery, strontium-90, which is abundantly available,
          would provide huge quantities of useful energy while decaying
          into harmless, non-radioactive zirconium", says Brown.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Beta Voltaic Effect may
          simply be defined as the conversion of ionizing radiation to
          electrical energy by a material or combination of materials.
          Radiation that is absorbed in the vicinity of any potential
          barrier, say a p-n junction, a metal-semiconductor contact or
          an electric field will generate separate electron-hole pairs
          which in turn flow in an electric circuit due to the voltaic
          effect. Of course, this occurs to a varying degree in
          different materials and geometries.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A cartoon representation of
          a basic beta voltaic conversion is shown in Figure 1.
          Electrode A has a positive potential while electrode B is
          negative with the potential difference provided by any
          conventional means. An electric field exists between the
          electrodes, and we shall call this zone the junction.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The junction between the two
          electrodes is comprised of a suitably ionizable medium exposed
          to decay particles emitted from a radioactive source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To explain the energy
          conversion mechanism for this arrangement, we will look at the
          energy flow in stages:</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Stage 1</i> ~ Before we
          introduce the radioactive source, we have a difference in
          potential between two electrodes provided by any means. An
          electric load R<sub>L</sub> is connected across the electrodes
          A and B. Although a potential difference exists, no current
          flows through the load R<sub>L</sub> because the electrical
          forces are in equilibrium and no energy comes out of the
          system. We shall call this the ground state Eo.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Stage 2</i> ~ Next, we
          introduce the radioactive source, say a beta emitter, to the
          system. Now, the energy of the beat particle E<sub>B</sub>
          generates electron-hole pairs in the junction by imparting
          kinetic energy to the generated ions through collisions.
          Energy is required to strip an electron from a neutral atom.
          We shall call this amount of energy the ionization potential
          of the junction E<sub>1</sub>. So a small portion of the beta
          particle's energy EB goes to generate ions firstly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Stage 3</i> ~ Secondly,
          the beta particle imparts an amount of energy in excess of the
          ionization potential. This additional energy raises the
          electron energy to an elevated level E<sub>2</sub>. Of course
          the beta particle does not impart its energy to a single ion
          pair, but rather a single beta particle will generate many
          thousands of electron-hole pairs. The total number of ions per
          unit volume of the junction is dependent upon the junction
          material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Stage 4</i> ~ Next, the
          electric field present in the junction acts on the ions and
          drives the electrons into electrode A. the electrodes
          collected in electrode A together with the electron deficiency
          of electrode B establishes a Fermi Voltage between the
          electrodes. Naturally, the electrons in electrode A seek to
          give up their energy and go back to their ground state (Law of
          Entropy).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Stage 5</i> ~ The Fermi
          Voltage drives electrons from the electrode A through the load
          where they give up their energy in accordance with
          conventional electrical theory. A voltage drop occurs across
          the load as the electrons give up an amount of energy E<sub>3</sub>.
          Then the amount of energy available to be removed from the
          system is:</font> </p>

          electrons, after passing through the load have an amount of

          driven into the electrode B where it is allowed to recombine
          with a junction ion, releasing the recombination energy E<sub>4</sub>
          in the form of heat. This completes the circuit and the
          electron has returned to its original ground state.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nucell, Inc., a subsidiary
          of Peripheral Systems, Inc., is developing alternative energy
          technologies for generating electrical power by employing
          radioisotopes as the prime power source. A phenomenon known as
          the "Beta Voltaic Effect" is used to directly convert
          radioactive decay energy into electricity without going
          through a thermal cycle. The great attraction of isotopic
          power supplies is that radioactive decay energy is several
          orders of magnitude greater than chemical energy.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Work Description ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Simply put, a resonant
          nuclear generator is an AC beta voltaic isotope electric
          generator. The energy conversion mechanism is the same as in
          DC secondary emission isotope electric cells; namely, ions,
          generated by the absorption of alpha or beta decay, in the
          region of an electric field potential results in charge
          separation with an accumulation of electrons at an elevated
          Fermi potential and these electrons, in turn, give up their
          energy through an external circuit and load in a conventional
          manner (See Figure 1)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The efficiency limitations
          of the DC secondary emission cell, such as polarization and
          space charge effects, may be overcome by suitable application
          of an alternating electric field. To limit the system losses
          to only the ohmic heating inherent to the device is must be
          tuned to resonance. That is to say, the capacitive resistance
          must just counteract the inductive reactance bringing the
          power factor to unity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many design variations
          (Figure 2) are available while maintaining the general spirit
          of resonant nuclear generators. An oscillation transformer is
          necessary for the transfer of energy from the primary tank to
          an output circuit and load. Also required are an inductance,
          the tuning capacitor and a means for introducing the decay
          energy into a region provided with an ionizable medium and a
          potential gradient. Some form of regenerative or positive
          feedback is usually required but not absolutely necessary.
          Also, these components do not physically have to be separate.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I prefer to use an
          open-ended flux-composite oscillation transformer (Figure 3)
          due to its low damping characteristics, high quality factor,
          and good transformer efficiency. This transformer actually
          consists of a central powdered iron core wound with a primary
          winding, encircled by 8 other powdered iron cores, each with a
          primary and secondary winding. The primary of this transformer
          is also the primary inductance for the tank circuit. Figure 4
          shows the magnetic flux path of this composite transformer. In
          one design, a custom capacitor is assembled utilizing an
          isotope such as tritium, krypton-85 or strontium-90 deposited
          in the dielectric or semiconductor material. Design parameters
          for optimum performance are still being pursued.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once assembled and properly
          tuned, the device requires an electrical impulse to initiate
          the oscillation in the tank circuit. We have utilized two
          methods for this purpose (Figure 5): the first is simply a
          capacitive discharge device where an external capacitor is
          charged by an external source and discharged into the
          secondary (the output circuit) while the second method (Figure
          6) utilizes a Class C amplifier with a charging source
          attached to the high side of the primary capacitor and the
          Class C amp is used to discharge the primary capacitor to
          ground at a rate equal to the fundamental frequency of the
          device. Figure 7 is the actual schematic of one successful
          design. Note the resemblance to a cold cathode oscillator, as
          this device also operates in a vacuum. Figure 8 is the
          component layout for the vacuum cell.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 9 is another
          promising design which utilizes the custom capacitor I
          mentioned earlier, along with the composite transformer. The
          feedback coil is actually wound directly on the composite
          transformer exterior.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experiments have shown that
          conversion efficiencies on the order of 50% are achievable.
          This technology promises low weight, long life, compact, solid
          state isotopic power supplies. However, material degradation,
          frequency stability and reliable performance remain as our
          primary deficiencies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nucell has focused its
          research since 1985 on the development of this resonant
          nuclear technology. Although recently we have turned our
          attention to product development of DC contact potential
          isotope electric generators in the range of 10 to 5000
          milliwatts with a working life of 10 years. Patents are
          currently pending on this technology; consequently I am not
          yet at liberty to disclose many details, but we expect to be
          production-ready on these devices this year.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Once we have completed the
          development phase for the contact potential cells, we shall
          resume our nuclear resonant research program in an aggressive
          manner utilizing new information gained from our current
          efforts. Material preparation techniques, geometric
          configuration and design alternatives will be our principal
          interest.</font> </p>

          first at rest and then moving with velocity <i>v</i>. The

          lines of force directed radially outwards (Figure 2A); in
          consequence of its motion the moving charged particle has, in
          addition, a magnetic field with circular lines of force around

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The presence of a magnetic
          field around the moving body implies that magnetic energy is
          stored up in the medium surrounding it. In a magnetic field of
          strength H the magnetic energy stored up in a unit of volume
          of the medium of unit permeability is given by H<sup>2</sup>/8pi.



          Integrating the value of this expression over the region&nbsp;

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This means that the moving
          charged particle has an amount of energy equal to its kinetic
          energy plus the energy of the magnetic field. The absorption
          of the charged particle is such that the velocity goes to zero
          causing the magnetic field to collapse. This in turn produces
          an emf which may be utilized by means of induction. The entire
          process is the reverse of a particle accelerator. In a
          particle accelerator, a great deal of energy is pumped into a
          slow moving charge to accelerate it to high velocities and a
          portion of this energy goes to increase the magnetic field
          strength. However, our device is a particle decelerator,
          utilizing high speed particles emitted from natural
          radioactive decay which we bring to a stop, releasing the
          stored energy. With this in mind, the Nuclear Powered
          Oscillator is more precisely an oscillating particle
          decelerator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Devices for converting
          natural radioactive decay directly into electricity are
          nothing new. The Beta Cell was first demonstrated by Mosely in
          1913 (Ref. 1) and over the years many types and methods have
          been developed (Ref. 2). This technology has been made
          possible due to the electrical nature of alpha and beta
          disintegrations.</font> </p>

          battery is the Burke Cell (US Patent # 3,939,366, Ref. 4).
          This method consists of a conventional battery and a
          conventional load connected by means of a radioactive
          conductor. If we inspect this arrangement we find that all of
          the power dissipated in the load is not drawn from the
          battery. And upon closer examination we find that a current
          amplification occurs within the radioactive conductor (Ref.

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This phenomenon is known as
          the Beta Voltaic Effect, and it may be explained by referring
          to Figure 6. For the simple case of this example, we will set
          the radioactive source (any alpha or beta emitter) external
          and separate from a silver wire. Now the battery from Figure 5
          provides an electromotive force (emf) across the wire and
          consequently, conduction electrons within the wire are set in
          uniform motion. By definition, electricity is measured in
          terms of the number of charged particles (electrons) moving
          past a point in a unit of time and we call this amperes.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The process by which a beta
          p[article is absorbed, is such that the beta particle collides
          with the molecular structure of the copper, knocking electrons
          free. This electron avalanche occurs until the beta particle
          (electron) effectively comes to rest. A single beta particle
          emitted from strontium-90 that is absorbed in copper will
          generate 80,000 ions in a distance of 0.030 inches. Now, as
          soon as these electrons are knocked loose, they effectively
          become free electrons in the wire, and as such these
          additional electrons are acted upon by the emf applied across
          the wire to give the avalanche electrons a uniform direction
          of flow, regardless of their incident angle. This increase in
          the number of moving charged carriers is measured in the real
          world as increased current. We also measure a reduction in the
          resistance of the wire (Ref. 6), an increase in its
          conductivity (Ref. 7), while the current is directly
          proportional to the voltage (Ref. 8). In other words, the
          current goes up with an increase in voltage (Ref. 5). This is
          basically attributed to the increased emf acting on a greater
          number of avalanche electrons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Additionally, flux cutting
          also occurs as the beta particle approaches the current
          carrying wire which yields an emf to help drive electrons
          (Ref. 9).</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now we will look at how we
          apply this phenomenon to our device. Figure 7 depicts a basic
          LC tank circuit comprised of an inductor and a capacitor.
          Theoretically, if this LC circuit were superconductive, then
          an externally applied electric impulse would yield an LC
          oscillation that would continue to oscillate forever due to no
          losses in the system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, our LC circuit is
          not superconductive, and the oscillation damps out due to the
          losses inherent to the LC tank. To minimize these inherent
          losses, we tune the circuit into resonance at the
          self-resonant frequency of the inductor. This causes the
          inductive and capacitive reactances to cancel, leaving only
          ohmic losses (resistance).</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If we apply a radioactive
          source as part of the LC tank, then through every cycle of the
          oscillation of which current is flowing, that current gets
          amplified by an amount proportional to the activity of the
          source. All we need is an input of an amount of energy equal
          to the system losses to achieve a sustained oscillation. At
          this point, we have a self-driven oscillator that we call a
          Nuclear Powered Oscillator.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any energy contributed to
          this oscillating LC tank must be removed and we accomplish
          this by simply impedance-matching a transformer which yields
          high-frequency AC current to drive a load. In a nutshell, that
          is the principle of operation for the Resonant Nuclear Power
          Supply: an LC tank circuit oscillating at its self-resonant
          frequency, driven by natural radioactive decay energy. Energy
          in excess of the operational requirements is removed through a
          transformer to yield electrical energy in usable form to drive
          a load.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 10 depicts the
          starting method which involves the use of a high voltage
          source to charge the capacitor of the tank circuit, which is
          then discharged to ground through a Class C amplifier at a
          rate equal to the resonant frequency of the tank circuit. A
          spectrum analyzer is used to monitor the activity within the
          tank and once a clean oscillation is started, the high voltage
          power supply and Class C amplifier are removed, a process that
          takes a few seconds. Then the power removed from the tank
          circuit is determined by measuring the voltage drop across a
          resistor of known value and double-checked by directly
          measuring the current delivered to the load.</font> </p>

          was performed including a search of the published literature.
          This revealed a significant amount of supportive data.
          Experiments followed on the effects of alpha and beta
          radiation absorbed in a current-carrying inductor. The results
          demonstrated (1) a reduction in the resistance of the coil,
          (2) an increase of the quality factor (Q) of the circuit, and
          (3) an increased conductivity of the inductor.</font> </p>

          demonstrated a frequency stability problem and showed signs of
          material degradation.</font> </p>

            Invention</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          relates generally to apparatus for the direct conversion of
          the energy of radioactive decay products to electrical energy
          and, more particularly, to the utilization of an alpha source
          to sustain and amplify oscillations in an LC oscillator
          circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A growing need exists today
          for small, compact, reliable, lightweight and self-contained
          rugged power supplies to provide electrical power in such
          applications as electric automobiles, homes, industrial,
          agricultural, recreational, remote monitoring systems and
          satellites. The majority of today's satellites are powered by
          solar cells and conventional chemical batteries and require
          only a small amount of power to operate. Radar, advanced
          communications satellites and, especially, high-technology
          weapons platforms will require much larger power sources than
          today's space power systems can deliver. For the very high
          power applications, nuclear reactors appear to be the answer.
          However, for the intermediate power range, 10 to 100 kilowatts
          (kw), the nuclear reactor presents formidable technical
          problems. Given today's efficiencies, it would require many
          acres of solar panels to provide 100 kw. Similarly, enough
          chemical fuel to provide 100 kw for any significant period of
          time would be too heavy and bulky for practical use.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Heretofore, there have been
          known several methods for conversion of radioactive energy
          released during the decay of natural radioactive elements into
          electrical energy. A grapefruit-sized radioisotope
          thermo-electric generator that utilized the heat produced from
          alpha particles emitted as plutonium-238 decays was developed
          during the early 1950's. However, the power output was limited
          to a few hundred watts. Other methods converting the energy of
          radioactive decay directly into electrical energy are
          disclosed in US Patent # 3,290,522, # 3,409,820, and #
          3,939,366.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">US Patent # 3,290,522
          entitled "Nuclear Emission Electrical Generator" issued to
          Robert Ginell on Dec. 6, 1966, discloses apparatus which
          provides electrical power by modulating the density of a cloud
          of charged particles confined within an enclosed space by a
          magnetic field. A radioactive material is positioned at the
          center of an enclosing hollow sphere having its inner surface
          coated with silver. The sphere is centrally positioned between
          the poles of a permanent magnet. The variation in the density
          of the cloud of charged particles causes a variation in the
          magnetic field created by the cloud. This variation in the
          magnetic field cuts an electrically conductive means to create
          an electrical potential and current therein. The density of
          the cloud of charged particles may be varied by applying a
          periodically varying electrostatic or electromagnetic field to
          the confined cloud of charged particles. The electrical energy
          is derived from the kinetic energy imparted to the charged
          particles (decay products) on the occurrence of a spontaneous
          disintegration event during the decay of the radioactive
          material. However, with this system, the conversion efficiency
          is very low and the amount of electrical power provided too
          small for most applications.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">US Patent # 3,409,820
          entitled "Electric Power Apparatus" issued to James O. Burke
          on Nov. 5, 1968, discloses an amplification of an electric
          current by the conduction of electric current through a
          radioactive material. While providing some current
          amplification, the system requires an external power source,
          such as a conventional battery, and thus, cannot provide
          sufficient power for most applications.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">US Patent # 3,939,366
          entitled "Method of Converting Radioactive Energy to Electric
          Energy and Device for Performing the Same" issued to Yasuro
          Ato, et al., on Feb. 17, 1976, discloses an apparatus in which
          radioactive energy is converted to electric energy by
          irradiating a semiconductor material with radioactive decay
          products to produce a number of electron-hole pairs in the
          material. A magnetic field is applied across the semiconductor
          material in a direction perpendicular to the direction of
          diffusion of the electron-hole pairs and to the direction of
          the applied magnetic field thus collecting the electrons and
          the holes at electrodes provided on the respective end faces
          of the semiconductor material to produce an electric potential
          across the semiconductor material. While the conversion
          efficiency of the system disclosed by Ato, et al., is
          considerably higher than that disclosed by either Burke or
          Ginell, the power output of the system is not great enough for

          single radioactive material by itself produces thereby
          providing the necessary flux for large power output from a
          small core volume. Use of long-lived isotopes, such as radium,

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Detailed Description of
            the Preferred Embodiment</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now to Figure 1,
          an equivalent electrical circuit of a nuclear battery
          constructed according to the principles of the present
          invention is shown. An LCR circuit 1 is comprised of a
          capacitor 3, inductor 5, transformer T primary winding 9 and
          resistance 11 connected in series. It is assumed that the
          electrical conductors connecting the various circuit elements
          and forming the inductor 5 and primary winding 9 are perfect
          conductors; i.e., no DC resistance. Resistor 11 is a lump
          resistance equivalent to the total DC resistance of the actual
          circuit components and conductors. The inductor 5 is wound on
          a core 7 which is composed of a mixture of radioactive
          elements decaying primarily by alpha particle emission.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When current flows in an
          electrical circuit energy is dissipated or lost in the form of
          heat. Thus, when oscillations are induced in an LCR circuit,
          the oscillations will gradually damp out due to the loss of
          energy in the circuit unless energy is continuously added to
          the circuit to sustain the oscillations. In the LCR circuit
          shown in Figure 1, a portion of the energy imparted to the
          decay products, such as alpha particles, during the
          radioactive decay of the materials making up inductor core 7
          is introduced into the circuit 1 when the decay products are
          absorbed by the conductor which forms inductor 5. Once
          oscillations have been induced in the LCR circuit 1, the
          energy absorbed by inductor 5 from the radioactive decay of
          the core 7 materials will sustain the oscillations as long as
          the amount of energy absorbed is equal to the amount of energy
          dissipated in the ohmic resistance of the circuit 1. If the
          absorbed is greater than the amount of energy lost through
          ohmic heating, the oscillations will be amplified. This excess
          energy can be delivered to a load 17 connected across the
          transformer T secondary winding 13.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The processes involved in
          the conversion of the energy released by the spontaneous
          disintegration of a radioactive material into electrical
          energy are numerous and complex. Materials that are naturally
          radioactive decay by the emission of either an alpha particle
          or a beta particle, and gamma rays may accompany either
          process. Radioactive materials that decay primarily by alpha
          particle emission are preferred as the inductor core 7
          material. Alpha particles are emitted with very high speeds,
          on the order of 1.6.times.10.sup.7 meters per second (m/s),
          and, consequently, have very high kinetic energy. Alpha
          particles emitted when radium, for example, decays are found
          to consist of two groups, those with a kinetic energy of
          48.79.times.10.sup.5 electron volts (ev) and those having an
          energy of 46.95.times.10.sup.5 ev. This kinetic energy must be
          dissipated when the alpha particles are absorbed by the
          conductor forming inductor 5. During the absorption process,
          each alpha particle will collide with one or more atoms in the
          conductor knocking electrons from their orbits and imparting
          some kinetic energy to the electrons. This results in
          increased numbers of conduction electrons in the conductor
          thereby increasing its conductivity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the alpha particle is
          a positively charged ion, while the alpha particle is moving
          it will have an associated magnetic field. When the alpha
          particle is stopped by the conductor, the magnetic field will
          collapse thereby inducing a pulse of current in the conductor
          producing a net increase in the current flowing in the circuit
          1. Also, there will be additional electrons stripped from
          orbit due to ionization produced by the positively charged
          alpha particles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now to Figure 2,
          the nuclear battery 20 is constructed in a cylindrical
          configuration. Inductor 5 is constructed of copper wire wound
          in a single layer around the radioactive core 7. Decay
          products, such as alpha particles, are emitted radially
          outward from the core 7 as indicated by arrows 2 to be
          absorbed by the copper conductor forming inductor 5. Eight
          transformers 15 are arranged in a circular pattern to form a
          cylinder concentric with and surrounding inductor 5. The
          transformers 15 have primary windings 9a-9h connected in
          series which are then connected in series with inductor 5 and
          capacitor 3 to form an LCR circuit. The central core 7,
          inductor 5 and the eight transformers 15 are positioned within
          a cylindrical-shaped container 19. Copper wire is wound in a
          single layer on the outside wall and the inside wall of
          cylinder 19 to form windings 23 and 21 respectively. The
          transformers 15 secondary windings 13a-13h and windings 21 and
          23 are connected in series to output terminals 25 and 27. The
          configuration of inductor 5 is designed to insure maximum
          irradiation of the copper conductor by the radioactive core
          source 7. The cylindrical configuration of the power
          transformer insures maximum transformer efficiency with
          minimum magnetic flux leakage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now to Figure 3,
          the radioactive core 7 comprises a radium needle 39 surrounded
          by a cylinder of powdered thorium 31 having a plurality of
          uranium rods 33 positioned within the thorium 31. The powdered
          thorium 31 is contained by concentric cylinder walls 35 and
          37. The use of a mixture of these radioactive materials for
          the core 7 produces a synergistic effect in that a greater
          flux of alpha particles is produced than by any one of the
          materials above due to additional induced disintegration
          events occurring.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring now to Figures 4
          and 5, top and side views of a nuclear battery constructed in
          accordance with the principles of the present invention is
          shown. The inductor core 7 consists of radium needle 39
          positioned longitudinally in the center of a cylinder of
          powdered thorium 31. The powdered thorium 31 is contained by
          concentric cylinder walls 35 and 37 (a material such as light
          cardboard may be utilized for this purpose). Inductor 5 is
          formed from two layers of American Wire Gage (AWG) #8 copper
          wire, one layer 41 wound on the inward facing wall 37
          surrounding the radium needle 39 and the other layer 43 wound
          on the outside of wall 35 thereby surrounding the powdered
          thorium 31 and uranium rods 33. The inductor core 7 is 11/4
          inches in diameter and 6 inches long, with an overall diameter
          of 15/8 inches for inductor 5. The eight transformers 15 each
          have a core 45 of laminated silicon steel 3/4 inches square by
          6 inches in length. The primary windings 9a-9h each consist of
          four layers of AWG #18 copper wire and the secondary windings
          13a-13h each consist of two layers of AWG #12 copper wire. The
          transformers 15 have an overall outside diameter of 11/4
          inches. The outer cylinder 19 is laminated silicon steel and
          an inner winding 21 of AWG #12 copper wire and an outer
          winding 23 of AWG #12 copper wire. End plates 47 and 49
          consisting of 1/2 inch thick annular rings of laminated
          silicon steel having an inner diameter of 23/4 inches and
          outer diameter of 43/4 inches are utilized to provide a low
          reluctance path to complete the magnetic circuit as shown by
          dashed line 51.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When assembled, the nuclear
          battery is immersed in an oil-filled can (not shown) equipped
          with heat sinks (not shown) to provide the necessary cooling
          for the power transformer. The capacitor 3 used in the LCR
          circuit is a high Q energy discharge resonant capacitor of the
          oil filled type.</font> </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> Disclosed is a radioactive waste treatment
        process for transmuting long-lived radioisotopes into
        short-lived radioisotopes through applied nuclear physics.
        Nuclear reactions, specifically of the (gamma, n) type, also
        known as photodisintegration, are utilized to accomplish this
        transmutation from troublesome, long-lived radioactive waste
        isotope(s) of given atomic mass to shorter-lived or stable
        materials of lower atomic mass, by exposing the troublesome
        isotopes to a high energy photon flux for a sustained time.
        Generally speaking, the target nucleus of the radioisotope(s) to
        be treated is irradiated by gamma photons of an energy greater
        than the binding energy of the neutron in the target nucleus.
        This causes the irradiated nucleus to absorb the gamma rays,
        thereby placing the nucleus in an excited state. Upon
        relaxation, the nucleus ejects a neutron through the (gamma, n)
        reaction, thereby transmuting the element to an isotope of lower
        atomic mass and shorter half-life.</p>
