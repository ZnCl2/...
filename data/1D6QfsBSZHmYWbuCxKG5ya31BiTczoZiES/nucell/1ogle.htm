"Ogle Fuel System - No Hoax"</font></b><a name="nohoax"></a> <br>
  <b>By Gregory Jones</b></p>
  </center>
  <p>Tom Ogle says it wasn't a hoax. </p>
  <p>He insists there were no hidden fuel tanks or other alternate fuel
sources
used to power a two-ton automobile for 205 miles Saturday on only two
gallons
of gasoline fumes. </p>
  <p>Ogle isn't alone in his no-hoax statements. </p>
  <p>Carl Wright, for example, has been working on internal combustion
machines
for 35 years. He is a certified teacher of auto mechanics and is
currently
shop foreman at Peck's Automotive Service, where Ogle built his
controversial
energy-saving fuel system. </p>
  <p>"It's no hoax." Wright said in straight-forward fashion. "There
were
no hidden tanks." Wright, who has no vested interests in the invention,
said at first he was skeptical of the young man's invention. </p>
  <p>"I've watched the thing from the time they built the fuel tank to
the
very present," Wright said, "It looks to me like it'll do what Tom said
it would do." </p>
  <p>Wright said any secret fuel compartments would have required many
extra
man-hours by Ogle to install in the car body. </p>
  <p>"He only worked on the car during office hours," Wright said,"and
he
didn't have a key to the door" to get into the automotive shop during
off-hours
or weekends. </p>
  <p><i>Experts Probe Ogle Fuel System</i> </p>
  <p>"He has not been here working on the car at nights, and the car
has
been locked up here every night." Wright said. </p>
  <p>James Peck, who owns Peck's Automotive, has a 50-50 partnership on
any
royalties from the invention. And he said he would stake his 30 year
professional
reputation in northeast EI Paso on the fact that there was no hoax
involved
in Saturday's test drive. </p>
  <p>"I personally believe he (Ogle) had some help some-where along the
way
developing the system, although he will not admit to that. But I can
vouch
that the system works. It's no hoax. It was my car hr converted. We
built
system in my shop. I'll put my name on the line. It definitely works. </p>
  <p>Peck said he provided financial back for Ogle's invention after he
and
Ogle met about a month ago and discussed the system. </p>
  <p>Frank Haynes Jr. is registered state engineer with degrees from
the
University of Texas at Austin and Southern Methodist University. He was
at Peck's Automotive Saturday where he looked the system over and
talked
with Ogle. </p>
  <p>"From what I saw, there was no hoax." Haynes said, adding that he
learned
of Ogle's invention in The Times. </p>
  <p>" I decided to venture out and see what was going on," he said. "
I'd
never even heard of Tom Ogle before. But I'm familiar with combustion
from
previous work and wondered what the kid had come up with. </p>
  <p>"What I saw was very convincing," Haynes said. Haynes said he felt
the
only chance of a hoax might have been in the amount of fuel that
actually
was in the tank. </p>
  <p>Prior to the test drive Saturday, reporters and onlookers
witnessed
a mechanic at Peck's empty the special, pressurized gas tanks, and pour
two gallons of fuel into the tank after it was empty. </p>
  <p>Haynes said he was additionally convinced of the system's
authenticity
by the fact it was difficult to start the car before heading to Deming.
  </p>
  <p>"The car had to be primed quite thoroughly in order to run. That
gave
me the idea that there weren`t any fumes in the system after drainage. </p>
  <p>"That was quite convincing for me personally. If there had been
hidden
fuel, there wouldn`t have been any difficulty in starting the car,
according
to how he (Ogle) described the system to me," Haynes said. </p>
  <p>Haynes described Ogle as an "open, earnest young man who convinced
me
everything he said should be true." </p>
  <p>Ogle all along has maintained nothing but simple trust in his
invention. </p>
  <p>"It works," he said frankly. "There is no hoax." </p>
  <p>He described his Saturday test drive, in which a times reporter
participated
as a "beautiful performance." </p>
  <p>Ogle added with a chuckle that the return to El Paso from Deming
was
made with one pint and two ounces of fuel left in the fuel tank. </p>
  <p>"We did pretty good though. We made 205 miles on less than two
gallons,"
he added. </p>
  <p>He said he maintained constant 55 to 60 mile per hour speeds. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">"200 Miles On Two Gallons Of Gas"</font></b><a
 name="200mpg"></a> <br>
  <b>By John Doussard</b></p>
  </center>
  <p>"Once I get to Deming and back I'll have everybody banging at my
door!"
Tom Ogle exclaimed. It was as uncommon sentiment that may very well
prove
to be true. </p>
  <p>Saturday the 34-year-old inventor mechanic climbed behind the
wheel
of his 1979 Ford Galaxy and headed down the road toward both the dusty
New Mexico town and possible fame, fortune and a solution to the energy
crisis. </p>
  <p>With only two gallons of gasoline in the tank, Ogle offered strong
evidence
that the tangle of red hoses and tubes racing between the back of the
5,000
pound car and the engine performed as billed: delivering over 100 miles
to the gallon while averaging close to 60 miles per hour. </p>
  <p>Indeed, in a day of automotive and personal triumph, the only sour
note
was sounded when Ogle failed to bring his gas-saver back into El Paso
as
planned. On the outskirts of town, just a few miles from his final
goal,
a rock struck the underside of the car,puncturing a filter and allowing
the gas fumes the auto travels to escape. </p>
  <p>But it really hardly mattered at that point. Ogle had traveled 205
miles
on slightly less than two gallons of gas.Some of the precious liquid
had
been spilled when first poured in the tank. </p>
  <p>"I use about four gallons of gas every two weeks," Ogle said. "But
then
I drive an awful lot." </p>
  <p>Actually, Saturday's performance was rather modest. Ogle claims
his
system will average about 160 miles per gallon in city driving,
treatment
average of 12 miles per gallon. </p>
  <p>"I fixed-up my car, a 1972 Thunderbird with a 429 cubic inch
engine,
with the system," Ogle said. "I then took it to Cloudcroft and back on
two gallons, about 200 miles. </p>
  <p>"And I still had enough to drive around when I got back in town." </p>
  <p>The odd thing about Ogle's system is that doesn't add complex
gadgets
and intricate gimmicks. Instead, it removes the carburetor, a piece of
the engine long considered sacred. </p>
  <p>"Engineers said it wouldn't work because without a carburetor
there's
nothing to vaporize the fuel," Ogle explained during the trip across
the
hot dessert. "They couldn't understand that it's already working on
vapors. </p>
  <p>"Instead everybody kept trying to add something to the carburetor
while
nobody thought of taking the thing off." </p>
  <p>Basically the system uses a standard engine with a few
modifications
In lieu of the carburetor there is a series of hoses feeding a mixture
of gas vapors and air directly into the engine. </p>
  <p>Gas in the tank passes through a series of filters, which stretch
the
energy available in each gallon. The ??? also store excess vapors for
later
use for up to 45 days. Premium gas is needed, as its higher octane
level
allows for more vapors to build. </p>
  <p>Not only does Ogle's car promise more miles per gallon, but he
says
it will clean the environment while causing its owner fewer repair
headaches. </p>
  <p>"It will top anything on the road today, being smoother, better
running
and more efficient," Ogle said. "The life of your car will be two times
longer because there will be no carbon build-up. </p>
  <p>"The carbon comes from unburned gas, but we burn it all.You won't
have
need all the catalytic converters for the air." </p>
  <p>Before the journey began, two Times reporters looked the car over
for
possible hidden sources of fuel, and found none. Then a brief ceremony
emptying the gas tank, and after the last drop fell, two gallons were
poured
back in. </p>
  <p>While only an expert could say for sure the trip was completed
with
only those two gallons, spectators, reporters and other interested
inventors
present all appeared satisfied. </p>
  <p>"This is the hottest thing of this century," Frank Haynes, Jr. an
independent
engineer living in this area, said. "Engineers have been beating their
heads against the wall to come up with something like this. </p>
  <p>"I honestly don't think it's a hoax." </p>

  <p><b><i>The Tribune</i></b> (June 8, 1978) ~ </p>
  <center><b><font size="+1">"Mileage Astounds Experts"</font></b><a

  <b>By Ron Laytner</b></center>
  <p>El Paso, Texas --- Is a young high school dropout the most
important
American inventor since Thomas Edison? </p>
  <p>Will he and the world energy shortage and show us how to drive
from
New York to Los Angeles on $15 worth of gasoline? Or is it all a hoax
to
get inventors' money and infuriate the oil companies? </p>
  <p>El Paso has been excited ever since 25-year-old Tom Ogle, a
simply-educated,
home-town auto mechanic, astounded engineers by converting his car's
engine
so it appears to drive 100 miles on a gallon of gasoline. </p>
  <p>Ogle did away with the carburetor and fuel pump, replacing them
with
a secret black box he calls a filter. The super mileage, he said, was
due
to his pressurized, vaporized fuel system that injects fumes directly
into
the engine's firing chambers. </p>
  <p>Engineers have tried but found no evidence of fraud. On April 30
last
year Ogle drove a 1970 Ford Galaxy 200 miles from El Paso to Deming,
NM,
on a measured two gallons of gasoline. The auto was inspected for
hidden
fuel tanks but none were found. </p>
  <p>Ogle and his car were under observation at all times yet the
"Oglemobile"
went the distance without stopping for fuel and averaged 100 miles per
gallon at 55 mph. Doublers became believers. Scientists were amazed.
Many
were convinced Ogle's claim is legitimate. </p>
  <p>Tom Ogle believes his new company, Ogle Fuel Systems, will soon
become
one of America's largest corporations because the world must have his
invention.
He plans to have a miniaturized version installed in test cars by the
end
of July, and expects to have it on the market within a year, selling
for
about $300 a unit, installed. </p>
  <p>If he can survive criticism by giant auto and oil interests he
could
become one of the worlds richest men. And he will,according to
millionaire
C.F. Ramsey, an international financier from Longview,WA, who has
backed
Ogle with "unlimited funds" for world-wide marketing rights. </p>
  <p>Ogle was easier to meet with a few months ago but with success
he's
become reclusive, a junior Howard Hughes hiding from the press. </p>
  <p>Then, he was set up in the back of garages owned by friends. Now,
he
is incommunicado, headquartered in El Paso's most prestigious building
and travelling in chauffeur-driven limousines and corporate jets. </p>
  <p>Before he went underground, Ogle told me, "We've had inquiries
from
Ford, Chevron, Shell, Volkswagen and Chrysler and calls from the
biggest
retailers in the world wanting marketing rights." But company spokesman
denied contact. </p>
  <p>Ogle said he refused one man,"Said he was the chief engineer for
Shell
oil and asked what I'd do if I got an offer of $25 million to sell
out."
Shell denies it. </p>
  <p>But a spokesman for investor Ramsey, said many giant corporations
had
been in El Paso trying to buy up control of Ogle's invention. </p>
  <p>The inventor said he discovered his fuel system by accident, "I
was
messing around with a gasoline lawn mower when I accidentally knocked a
fuel in its fuel tank. I put a vacuum line running from the tanks
straight
into the carburetor inlet."The lawn mower kept running. </p>
  <p>"I just let it run and it kept running but the fuel stayed the
same.
I got excited. The lawn mower engine was running without a carburetor
and
getting tremendous efficiency."The engine got hot so Ogle used an
electric
fan to cool it and was amazed when it ran 96 hours on the fuel
remaining
in the mower's small tank. </p>
  <p>He went from the lawn mower to the automobile engine, converting a
car
in the same manner, its engine started immediately but the gas tank
collapsed
inward. Many months and reinforced gas tanks later, he solved the
vacuum
problem. </p>
  <p>But, the car without its carburetor and fuel pump, had no
acceleration.
It couldn't run faster than 20 mph. And the modified engine averaged
only
eight miles to the gallon and stalled after 10 miles. </p>
  <p>One day Ogle crawled under the stalled car to examine its gas tank
and
got a surprise;"It was freezing cold, like an ice-cube.As I was sucking
vapors out, it was acting like a refrigerator with liquid on the bottom
and fumes on top." </p>
  <p>When he solved the stalling problem by warming the gas tank with
heater
coils, the miles pre gallon skyrocketed to over 100. Tom Ogle hasn't
looked
back since. </p>
  <p>He believes his system is the answer to the world's pollution
problems
and has demonstrated virtually zero pollutant emissions coming from his
engine exhaust at computerized auto engine test centers. </p>
  <p>In a typical test, with the engine running and the speedometer
over
55 mph, a jet of clean hot air, without the usual obnoxious smell,
leaves
the Oglemobile's exhaust pipe."You can dry your hair with it," said Tom
Ogle. </p>
  <p>After an hours high-speed run, water in the radiator is only luke
warm.
And a spark plug installed before the test comes out cleaner than it
had
gone in. </p>
  <p>He isn't afraid of oil interests."My wife Monika is scared, afraid
I'll
get kidnapped. But I'm safe. People still can't believe or understand
what
I've discovered. </p>
  <p>Ogle said he asked President Carter's assistance with developing
his
invention and had sent the president all the data and test results on
his
experimental model. At one point an official with the U.S. Energy
Research
and development Administration declared Ogle's vaporized fuel system
contained
no fakery. </p>
  <p>"I think personally, and with strong conviction, that there is no
hoax,"
said Richard W. Hern, fuel engineer systems supervisor at ERDA's
research
centers at Bartlesville, Okla. on May 6, 1977, after examining Ogle's
invention
until his patent and other legal matters were settled. </p>
  <p>But later Hern said it was impossible to get such mileage as the
invention
promised. He couldn't say more, he declared, because he was bound by a
statement of confidentiality he signed so that he could view the
invention. </p>
  <p>Ogle's noisiest critic has been Robert Levy, an El Paso physicist
who
insisted it was impossible to move a 5,000 pound car more than 50 miles
with the energy contained in one gallon of gasoline. Levy had stated
the
Oglemobile was a fraud but lately, as Ogle's credibility grows, he has
backed off, denying he ever called the system a hoax. </p>
  <p>Mack Massey, an El Paso auto dealer, who claims he's an early Ogle
backer,
said a patent search made last year on Ogle's system turned up a
similar
General Motors patent approved in 1972. But GM spokesmen said the
company
had more than 500 patents granted that year and would need a patent
number
to find out which invention Massey spoke of.Ogle said he received a
phone
call from GM requesting permission to inspect the car. But Joe
Karshner,
a company spokesmen, said "We haven't approached Ogle. He has never
made
a submission to us and we've never gone to him. </p>
  <p>"This is very controversial. We are interested in anything and
everything
that would improve a vehicle's performance. If Ogle's invention is
legitimate
we would be interested. He is free to come to us." </p>
  <p>Highly qualified men praise Ogle's system: John Whitacre,
professor
of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas, El Paso, said,
"To
me it looks like the only thing leaving the tank is air vapors, giving
better combustion. It's a different approach working with gas already
vaporized." </p>
  <p>Another supporter is professor Gerald Hawkins of Texas A&amp;M
University,
holder of a doctorate in mechanical engineering with a background in
gas
dynamics and aerospace study, member of the American Institute Of
Aeronautics
and Astronautics and The American Society of Mechanical Engineers. </p>
  <p>There is no hoax eliminated the carburetor and achieved what the
gasoline
internal combustion engine was supposed to do all along-to operate off
fumes. I don't know why somebody didn't try this before." </p>
  <p>Another Texas inventor, Frank Read of Fort Worth, said he
perfected
a system to improve gas mileage and that fights with auto manufacturers
almost broke him. He said he underwent 11 court battles with oil
companies
trying to buy of his unit with an agreement he never build another. He
felt Ogle had a long, hard road ahead. </p>
  <p>In Washington a spokesmen for U.S. Sen. Gaylord Nelson (D.Wis.)
said,
"It sounds to good to be true.But if the Ogle invention proves
feasible,
results would be awesome. </p>
  <p>"America could become oil self-sufficient and the drain of oil
dollars
to the Middle East ended." said Jeffrey Neddleman, legislative
assistant
to the lawmakers who pioneered U.S. government fuel economy standards. </p>
  <p>"The potential benefits are too great for it to be ignored. The
senator
is asking the Department of Transportation to make a thorough
investigation
of the Ogle system." </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">"Over 100 Miles on a Gallon of Gas"</font></b><a

  <b>By Gregory Jones</b></p>
  </center>
  <p><i>A 24 year-old inventor in El Paso, Texas, has the government
and
the automobile people taking a close look at his astounding experiment
that could revolutionizing the industry.</i> </p>
  <p>Two hundred miles on less then two gallons of gas? </p>
  <p>That's the spectacular fuel economy Tom Ogle got when he test
drove
a beat up, 4,600 pound, 351 cubic inch, 1970 Ford Galaxy on April 30
1977,
from El Paso, Texas, to Deming, New Mexico, and back. </p>
  <p>It's that type of performance that Ogle believes will liberate the
nation's
army of automobiles and commercial carriers from the bondage of high
costs
for fuel. According to Ogle, his system will reduce to near zero the
hydrocarbon
and photochemical pollutants emitted by the gasoline internal
combustion
engine and eliminate the traditional engine and eliminate the
traditional
carburetor and fuel pump- resulting in fewer tune-ups and maintenance. </p>
  <p>The 24-year-old inventor, who cared more as a youngster for
tinkering
around in automobile engines then playing sports, will have his system
patented, perfected and into mass production within a year. In the
meantime,
to convince the doubters, he plans to equip three late model cars with
his new fuel system (eight, six and four cylinder) and test prove them
in the laboratory and on the road. He predicts the powerful eight
cylinder
engine will get 90 to 120 miles per gallon;the six cylinder
medium-sized
engine will average 140 to 200 miles per gallon; and the economy
four-cylinder
engine will steal the show at 260 to 360 miles to the gallon. </p>
  <p><i>Unbelievable?</i> </p>
  <p>Well, one stumbling block, that leaves the critics searching for
an
answer is the monitor test run. It has been established no hoax was
perpetrated,
unless it was of such an elaborate nature that it escaped the scrutiny
of numerous mechanics and engineers. </p>
  <p>Ogle ran his test drive in West Texas and south central New
Mexico,
an arid environment that combines Yucca of the Chihuahuan Desert,
Cotton
Wood of the Rio Grande Valley, and the many types of pines that speckle
the upper reaches of the Rocky Mountains foothills. </p>
  <p>Before he would begin, the Ford was closely scrutinized for hidden
fuel
tank he designed for his fuel system was emptied of its contents, and a
carefully measured two gallons of gas was poured back in. The fuel tank
was checked for hidden compartments. None were found. It took ten to 15
minutes to get the car primed to start, proving all the more that there
was no hidden fuel and that the system had been emptied. Ogle then
drove
the low-hanging car out of Peck's Automotive Service and Body Shop,
located
in northeast El Paso, and followed a police escort to the city limits.
A caravan of curiosity seekers followed the vehicle to Interstate 10,
which
goes north out of El Paso to Las Cruces, New Mexico. There the Ford
test
car turned west, and followed Interstate 10 to Deming. </p>
  <p><i>The results?</i> </p>
  <p>Ogle summed it up. "It was like one guy commented... that we
actually
had really done something when we got to Las Cruces (45 miles from El
Paso).
When he hit Las Cruces, we were already going better than a Datson, "
Ogle
quipped, then nodded with his head toward the big Ford Galaxie as if to
say: "And in a car like that!" </p>
  <p>Ogle maintained 55 to 60 mile per hour speeds, and had to climb
one
steep incline just west of Las Cruces in order to get up on the mesa
which
remains relatively flat for the next 60 miles to Deming. </p>
  <p>The "Oglemobile," as the test car has come to be known, only
stopped
once in Deming, where Ogle, his assistant James Franklin, and a
newspaper
reporter had a cup of coffee "while some of the other cars got gas."
The
test run was in completion when he was forced onto a shoulder along the
highway and a rock flew up and punctured a "filter" in the fuel line,
causing
the vaporized power to escape to the atmosphere. The engine stalled and
the car had to be towed back to "Peck's" garage. "It was still a
success.
We proved we could do it," Ogle said later. </p>
  <p><i>How exactly did he do it?</i> </p>
  <p>Ogle is understandably cautious about explaining in to much detail
what
is that makes his system work. There is still the all-important matter
of getting a patent for his invention, and, until then, we'll have to
make
do with a nuts and bolts description. </p>
  <p>First off, the vaporized fuel system is nothing new. It's been
kicked
around for 50 years or more. Ogle said he did something that other
inventors
and experimenters didn't try, how ever, and that was to eliminate the
standard
carburetor. During the explanations he gave to professional mechanical
engineers, Ogle would proudly come forward, holding the defunct
carburetor,
smiling as broadly as a successful big game hunter. "Here's the
carburetor,"
he'd say, while the engineers pondered the "black box" contraption that
stood proudly in the carburetor's place. </p>
  <p>It's through this black box that the fumes are "filtered" a final
time
before being injected straight into the cylinders. Air is mixed with
the
fumes both at the fuel tank and the engine. A mechanical engineering
professor
from the University of Texas at El Paso suggested to Ogle that he call
his "filters" something else. "You're not actually filtering anything,"
professor John Whitacre said. "Those `filters' are actually more like
absorptive
surfaces or absorptive panels." </p>
  <p>Gerry Hawkins, a specialist in high performance engines, shook his
head
after viewing the Oglemobile. "It looks good," he said. "I don't know
why
somebody didn't try this before. He's eliminated the carburetor and
achieved
what the gasoline internal combustion engine was supposed to do all
along
--- to operate off fumes. The idea is feasible, and it appears he's
found
a way to make it work." Hawkins holds a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering
from Texas A&amp;M University and currently is on the U.T. El Paso
faculty. </p>
  <p>"To me it looks like the only thing that leaves the tank is the
fumes,"
claimed Whitacre. "That just gives you better combustion. I'm most
impressed.
It's a different approach, one that works with gas already vaporized.
Why
wasn't it developed before? Because everybody tried to make the
carburetor
work better instead." </p>
  <p>Ogle, too, believes that his invention is something that "could
have"
been made to work before but wasn't. </p>
  <p>"That's why this system is a breakthrough, and nobody can really
understand
what it is until the engineers have a chance to take it apart and see
what's
going on. If you base your arguments on conventional fuel systems, I
could
see why people would doubt this. Mine is a completely different system
that works on energy taken out of the gasoline. The normal engine takes
fuel out of the tank. With this system, you leave the gas in the tank
and
take the fumes from that gas out. The fumes are the explosive part of
the
gasoline. The problem is that everybody kept thinking the carburetor is
indispensable to the cycle. It's not." </p>
  <p>When asked about the safety of his system, particularly the fuel
tank
where gasoline is heated to generate more fumes, Ogle shrugged off the
question with a strong statement that his fuel tank is safer than those
installed on current models. </p>
  <p>"My tank is so thick it couldn't explode," he said, pulling back
his
early 1960's Beatles style hair cut. "I figured it all out on a
computer.
You only have about 240,000 to 250,000 pounds of pressure before the
conventional
fuel tank will explode. My tank, built of half-inch reinforced steel,
could
endure 360,000 pounds of pressure before blowing. With only three
gallons
of gas, which is the maximum any of my tanks will hold, you would only
generate about 240,000 to 250,000 pounds of pressure." </p>
  <p>In case of a backfire, Ogle said the fumes would be vented to the
atmosphere
via a safety valve installed in the aircraft hoses that connect the
fuel
tank to the engine. "If we were going to have an explosion, I guess you
might say that it should have happened when the car died on the way
back
from Deming. But the safety valve automatically went into action when
the
engine pressure dropped and vented the fumes outside the system." </p>
  <p>Ogle worked on his system for the past five years --- not an easy
task.
There were many times when he wanted to throw the wrench in. </p>
  <p>"The only thing I knew I needed was the pistons to go up and
down,"
he said gesturing with his hands in a vertical motion. "And all you
need
for that is an explosion. I sat back and started thinking what it took
to do that. The answer? The fumes." </p>
  <p>Ogle credits his four years of training in Kung Fu with helping
him
to overcome many of the obstacles with developing his fuel system. Kung
Fu is more of a mental attitude," he said, "as compared to karate or
judo
which uses force. Kung Fu teaches you to look for the pressure points,
but most important, to use mind control. It's a styling art. It taught
me not to give up." </p>
  <p>The German-born young man, who looks younger than his 24 years,
got
off to an unusual start with his fuel system. He was 19 years old and
was
tinkering around on a four-cycle lawn mower. He punched a hole in the
top
of the engine's fuel tank, removed the carburetor (more out of
curiosity
than anything else) and inserted a hose into the carburetor jet,
connecting
that the fuel tank. </p>
  <p>"The lawn mower ran for 96 straight hours at idle speed," he said.
"I
put fans around it so it wouldn't burn up." From the lawn mower, Ogle
advanced
to the mighty automobile engine. The principle's the same, only the
engine
is more completed." </p>
  <p>He tried his budding invention out on several cars, and progressed
in
stages, having satisfactorily overcome one hurdle only to encounter
another.
The first car a 1964 Oldsmobile was a failure. He got only eight miles
to the gallon. But it was on this Oldsmobile that he first experimented
with removing the carburetor. He learned then that combustion was more
complete, and that he could extract more energy per pound of fuel
without
the carburetor. </p>
  <p>"The Olds ran lousy. It had very little acceleration and, of
course
got terrible gas mileage. Most of the time the engine stalled. I knew I
had to get further into the thing." He then designed a system for
heating
the fuel tank which solved the stalling problem. </p>
  <p>It was back to the drawing board,however, because he still had a
problem
of low gasoline mileage to solve. That's when he came up with his
"filtering"
system, which he claims is the "real key to the system." After
designing
the filters he tested the system on his gray Ford Thunderbird, driving
the car on the road and in laboratory simulation for more than 140,000
miles. The T-Bird got from 118 to 140 miles per gallon a matter that
didn't
go unnoticed by his wife, Monika. "We only had to fill up about once a
month." she quipped, adding that the car got plenty of driving in the
city. </p>
  <p>The patent Office examiners in Washington are currently reviewing
the
blueprints of his system, however, the question has been raised that a
patent may have already been issued to a person or company for a system
similar to Ogle's. The company that has come up more often has been
General
Motors, although a man named Frank Read, in Fort Worth Texas who said
he
had designed a carburetor adjuster that will triple gas mileage,
discovered
as many as 19 patents that might be "similar" to Ogle's during his own
patent search in 1975-76. </p>
  <p>"If that's the case," Ogle shrugged, "why wasn't it on the market?
Anyhow,
I honestly doubt that anybody has a filter system like mine --- or has
ever thought of it." </p>
  <p>The specialist in fuel system design, who went to mechanical trade
school
rather than college, "because I say to many people with there master's
degrees looking around for jobs," said he would be very interested to
know
why the holder of a patent to a fuel-saving system such as his had not
put the invention into production. </p>
  <p>Since the completion of his invention, Ogle has received hundreds
of
phone calls. One, in particular, came from a Shell oil representative
who
asked him what he would do if somebody right now offered him $25
million
for the system. Ogle's response. "I would not be interested." </p>
  <p>"I've always wanted to be rich," Ogle said as a broad smile
crossed
his face, "and I suspect I will be when the system gets into
distribution.
But I'm not going to have my system bought up and put on the shelf. I'm
going to see this thing through --- that I promise." </p>
  <p>Ogle has already encountered a situation that was a disappointment
to
him. He believes an official from the federal Energy Research and
Development
Administration, who had viewed the Ogle system and rode in the
Ogle-mobile,
"took a turn around" after he went to Washington DC. </p>
  <p>The official, R.W. Hurn, of the ERDA research lab at
Bartletsville,
Oklahoma, was cautious and reserved with his comments about the system.
He said the system was "rudimentary" in construction and "obviously
needs
much refinement," but added, "that's not at all unusual with new
engineering
concepts." The one point Hurn commented on, without reservation, was
that
he did not think a hoax was involved. "That's the one thing I
personally
feel with strong conviction." </p>
  <p>In a statement prepared by Hurn for U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas,
he reiterated some of the statements he had made in El Paso, where he
talked
with the press under the hot sun in the back of Peck's garage. He said,
for example, that he had not seen verified experimented data to support
the 100 mile-per-gallon claims of Ogle's, nor had he seen measurements
appropriate and adequate to support Ogle's claims of engine pollution
characteristics.
However, the statement to Bensten contained the following: </p>
  <p>"In my opinion, certain claims (as I understand them to have been
made)
may be faulty, but, as stated before, not necessarily deliberately
misleading."
Hurn said he also could not make a technical assessment of the fuel
system's
potential for further development. </p>
  <p>"The whole sounds kind of fishy," Ogle said, after reading a
tele-communicated
copy of Hurn's statement. The government must be getting pressure from
somebody. He said one thing to me when he was here, and then turned
completely
around after going to Washington. I mean, we knew the system was
impractical
at this stage --- but it is as far as I could bring it without
engineering
help. Hurn said that he thought things could be worked out. Well, I'll
tell you one thing, if there is a real energy problem in this country,
and they don't consider this system as an alternative to the problem,
then
there must not be much of an energy crisis. </p>
  <p>"I realize that it's hard to break people away from the
conventional
designs.But if anybody doubts that my system doesn't work, after we've
proven all the federal standards and regulations, then they shouldn't
buy
it." </p>
  <p>The young man who opted for dropping out of high school, but
returned
later to obtain a graduate equivalency degree, who studied at the
University
of Morgantown Trade School in West Virginia, who specialized in fuel
systems,
welding, electronics and auto mechanics, has the determination to take
on all corners. </p>
  <p>"I decided a long time ago to achieve something, and feel now that
I've
achieved what I set out to do." </p>
  <p>But the battle isn't over. </p>

  <b><font size="+1">Fuel Economy System for an Internal Combustion
Engine</font></b> </p>
  <p><b>Tom Ogle (December 11, 1979)</b></p>
  </center>
  <p><i>Abstract</i> ~ <br>
A fuel economy system for an internal combustion engine which, when
installed in a motor vehicle, obviates the need for a conventional
carburetor,
fuel pump and gasoline tank. The system operates by using the engine
vacuum
to draw fuel vapors from a vapor tank through a vapor conduit to a
vapor
equalizer which is positioned directly over the intake manifold of the
engine. The vapor tank is constructed of heavy duty steel or the like
to
withstand the large vacuum pressure and includes an air inlet valve
coupled
for control to the accelerator pedal. The vapor equalizer ensures
distribution
of the correct mixture of air and vapor to the cylinders of the engine
for combustion, and also includes its own air inlet valve coupled for
control
to the accelerator pedal. The system utilizes vapor-retarding filters
in
the vapor conduit, vapor tank and vapor equalizer to deliver the
correct
vapor/air mixture for proper operation. The vapor tank and fuel
contained
therein are heated by running the engine coolant through a conduit
within
the tank. Due to the extremely lean fuel mixtures used by the present
invention,
gas mileage in excess of one hundred miles per gallon may be achieved. </p>

  <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
  <p><i>1. Field of the Invention </i>~ <br>
The present invention is related to internal combustion engines and,
more particularly, is directed towards a fuel economy system for an
internal
combustion engine which, when applied to a motor vehicle, obviates the
need for conventional carburetors, fuel pumps and gasoline tanks, and
enables
vastly improved gas mileage to be obtained. </p>
  <p><i>2. Description of the Prior Art ~</i> </p>
  <p>The prior art evidences many different approaches to the problem
of
increasing the efficiency of an internal combustion engine. Due to the
rising price of gasoline, and the popularity of motor vehicles as a
mode
of transportation, much of the effort in this area is generally
directed
towards increasing gas mileage for motor vehicles. Along with increased
gas mileage, much work has been done with a view towards reducing
pollutant
emissions from motor vehicles. </p>
  <p>I am aware of the following United States patents which are
generally
directed towards systems for improving the efficiency and/or reducing
the
pollutant emissions of internal combustion engines: </p>

  <p>The Chapin US Pat. No. 1,530,882 discloses a gasoline tank
surrounded
by a water jacket, the latter of which is included in a circulation
system
with the radiator of the automobile. The heated water in the
circulation
system causes the fuel in the gasoline tank to readily vaporize.
Suction
from the inlet manifold causes air to be drawn into the tank to bubble
air through the gasoline to help form the desired vapor which is then
drawn
to the manifold for combustion. </p>
  <p>The Buckton et al US Pat. No. 3,759,234 advances a fuel system
which
provides supplementary vapors for an internal combustion engine by
means
of a canister that contains a bed of charcoal granules. The Wentworth
and
Hietrich et al U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,221,724 and 3,001,519 also teach vapor
recovery systems which utilize filters of charcoal granules or the
like. </p>
  <p>The Dwyre US Pat. No. 3,713,429 uses, in addition to the normal
fuel
tank and carburetor, an auxiliary tank having a chamber at the bottom
thereof
which is designed to receive coolant from the engine cooling system for
producing gasoline vapors, while the Walker U.S. Pat. No. 3,395,681
discloses
a fuel evaporator system which includes a gasoline tank intended to
replace
the normal gasoline tank, and which includes a fresh air conduit 22 for
drawing air into the tank. </p>
  <p>The Fortino US Pat. No. 4,011,847 teaches a fuel supply system
wherein
the gasoline is vaporized primarily by atmospheric air which is
released
below the level of the gasoline, while the Crabtree et al U.S. Pat. No.
2,312,151 teaches a vaporization system which includes a gas and air
inlet
port located in a vaporizing chamber and which includes a set of
baffles
for effecting a mixture of the air and vapor within the tank. The Mondt
U.S. Pat. No. 3,888,223 also discloses an evaporative control canister
48 for improving cold start operation and emissions, while Sommerville
U.S. Pat. No. 4,015,570 teaches a liquid-fuel vaporizer which is
intended
to replace the conventional fuel pump and carburetor that is designed
to
mechanically change liquid gasoline to a vapor state. </p>
  <p>While the foregoing patents evidence a proliferation of attempts
to
increase the efficiency and/or reduce pollutant emissions from internal
combustion engines, no practical system has yet found its way to the
marketplace. </p>
  <p>OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
  <p>It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to
provide
a new and improved fuel economy system for an internal combustion
engine
which greatly improves the efficiency of the engine. </p>
  <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a unique
fuel
economy system for an internal combustion engine which provides a
practical,
operative and readily realizable means for dramatically increasing the
gas mileage of conventional motor vehicles. </p>
  <p>A further object of the present invention is to provide an
improved
fuel economy system for internal combustion engines which also reduces
the pollutant emissions. </p>
  <p>The foregoing and other objects are attained in accordance with
one
aspect of the present invention through the provision of a fuel vapor
system
for an internal combustion engine having an intake manifold, which
comprises
tank means for containing fuel vapor, vapor equalizer means mounted on
and in fluid communication with the intake manifold of the engine, and
vapor conduit means which connect the tank means to the vapor equalizer
means for delivering fuel vapor from the former to the latter. The
vapor
equalizer means includes a first valve means connected thereto for
controlling
the admission of air to the vapor equalizer means, while the tank means
has a second valve means connected thereto for controlling the
admission
of air to the tank means. A throttle controls the first and second
valve
means so that the opening of the first valve means proceeds and exceeds
the opening of the second valve means during operation. </p>
  <p>In accordance with other aspects of the present invention, filter
means
are positioned in the vapor conduit means for retarding the flow of
fuel
vapor from the tank means to the vapor equalizer means. In a preferred
form, the filter means comprises carbon particles and may include a
sponge-like
collection of, for example, neoprene fibers. In a preferred embodiment,
the filter means comprises a substantially tubular housing positioned
in
series inthe vapor conduit, the housing containing a central portion
comprising
a mixture of carbon and neoprene and end portions comprising carbon
positioned
on each side of the central portion. </p>
  <p>In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a
second
filter means is positioned in the vapor equalizer means for again
retarding
the flow of the fuel vapor to the engine intake manifold. The second
filter
means is positioned downstream of the first valve means and in a
preferred
form includes carbon particles mounted in a pair of recesses formed in
a porous support member. The porous support member, which may comprise
neoprene, includes a first recessed portion positioned opposite a vapor
inlet port in the vapor equalizer means to which the vapor conduit
means
is connected, while a second recessed portion is positioned opposite
the
intake manifold of the engine. </p>
  <p>In accordance with still other aspects of the present invention, a
third
filter means is positioned in the tank means for controlling the flow
of
fuel vapor into the vapor conduit means in proportion to the degree of
vacuum in the tank means. The filter means more particularly comprises
means for reducing the amount of fuel vapor delivered to the vapor
conduit
means when the engine is idling and when the engine has attained a
steady
speed. The throttle means acts to close the second valve means when the
engine is idling and when the engine has attained a steady speed to
thereby
increase the vacuum pressure in the tank means. In a preferred form,
the
third filter means comprises a frame pivotally mounted within the tank
means and movable between first and second operating positions. The
first
operating position corresponds to an open condition of the second valve
means, while the second operating position corresponds to a closed
condition
of the second valve means. The tank means includes a vapor outlet port
to which one end of the vapor conduit means is connected, such that the
second operating position of the frame places the third filter means in
communication with the vapor outlet port. </p>
  <p>More particularly, the third filter means in a preferred form
includes
carbon particles sandwiched between two layers of a sponge-like filter
material, which may comprise neoprene, and screen means for supporting
the layered composition within the pivotable frame. Means in the form
of
a conduit is positioned on the third filter means for placing the
latter
in direct fluid communication with the vapor outlet port when the frame
is in its second operating position. </p>
  <p>In accordance with yet other aspects of the present invention, a
conduit
is connected between the valve cover of the engine and the vapor
equalizer
means for directing the oil blow-by to the vapor equalizer in order to
minimize valve clatter. The tank means also preferably includes a
copper
conduit positioned in the bottom thereof which is connected in series
with
the cooling system of the motor vehicle for heating the tank and
generating
more vapor. A beneficial byproduct of the circulating system reduces
the
engine operating temperature to further improve operating efficiency. </p>

  </center>
  <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </p>
  <p>Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals
represent
identical or corresponding parts throughout the several views, and more
particularly to FIG. 1 thereof, there is illustrated a preferred
embodiment
of the present invention as installed in a motor vehicle. </p>
  <p>The preferred embodiment includes as its main components a fuel
vapor
tank 10 in which the fuel vapor is stored and generated for subsequent
delivery to the internal combustion engine 20. On the top of fuel vapor
tank 10 is mounted an air inlet control valve which is indicated
generally
by reference numeral 12 and whose structure and operation will be
described
in greater detail hereinafter. </p>
  <p>The internal combustion engine 20 includes a standard intake
manifold
18. Mounted upon the intake manifold 18 is a vapor equalizer chamber
16.
Connected between the fuel vapor tank 10 and the vapor equalizer
chamber
16 is a vapor conduit or hose 14 for conducting the vapors from within
tank 10 to the chamber 16. </p>
  <p>Reference numeral 22 indicates generally an air inlet control
valve
which is mounted on the vapor equalizer chamber 16. Thus, the system is
provided with two separate air inlet control valves 12 and 22 which are
respectively coupled via cables 24 and 26 to the throttle control for
the
motor vehicle which may take the form of a standard accelerator pedal
28.
The air inlet control valves 12 and 22 are synchronized in such a
fashion
that the opening of the air inlet control valve 22 of the vapor
equalizer
16 always preceeds and exceeds the opening of the air inlet control
valve
12 of the fuel vapor tank 10, for reasons which will become more clear
hereinafter. </p>
  <p>The cooling system of the vehicle conventionally includes a
radiator
30 for storing liquid coolant that is circulated through the engine 20
in the well-known fashion. A pair of hoses 32 and 34 are preferably
coupled
into the normal heater lines from the engine 20 so as to direct heated
liquid coolant from the engine 20 to a warming coil 36, preferably
constructed
of copper, which is positioned within vapor tank 10. I have found that
the water circulation system consisting of hoses 32, 34 and 36 serves
three
distinct functions. Firstly, it prevents the vapor tank from reaching
the
cold temperatures to which it would otherwise be subjected as a result
of high vacuum pressure and air flow therethrough. Secondly, the heated
coolant serves to enhance vaporization of the gasoline stored within
tank
10 by raising the temperature thereof. Thirdly, the liquid coolant,
after
leaving tank 10 via conduit 34, has been cooled to the point where
engine
20 may then be run at substantially lower operating temperatures to
further
increase efficiency and prolong the life of the engine. </p>
  <p>Included in series with vapor conduit 14 is a filter unit 38 which
is
designed to retard the flow of fuel vapor from the tank 10 to the vapor
equalizer 16. The precise structure of the filter unit 38 will be
described
in greater detail hereinafter. A thrust adjustment valve 40 is
positioned
upstream of the filter unit 38 in conduit 14 and acts as a fine
adjustment
for the idling speed of the vehicle. Positioned on the other side of
filter
unit 38 in conduit 14 is a safety shut-off valve 42 which comprises a
one-way
valve. Starting the engine 20 will open the valve 42 to permit the
engine
vacuum pressure to be transmitted to tank 10, but, for example, a
backfire
will close the valve to prevent a possible explosion. The tank 10 may
also
be provided with a drain 44 positioned at the bottom thereof. </p>
  <p>Positioned on the side of the vapor equalizer chamber 16 is a
primer
connection 46 which may be controlled by a dash mounted primer control
knob 48 connected to tank 10 via conduit 47. A conduit 50 extends from
the oil breather cap opening 52 in a valve cover 54 of the engine 20 to
the vapor equalizer 16 to feed the oil blow-by to the engine as a means
for eliminating valve clatter. This is believed necessary due to the
extreme
lean mixture of fuel vapor and air fed to the combustion cylinders of
the
engine 20 in accordance with the present invention. </p>
  <p>Referring now to FIGS. 2 and 3, the fuel vapor tank 10 of the
present
invention is illustrated in greater detail in orthogonal sectional
views
and is seen to include a pair of side walls 56 and 58 which are
preferably
comprised of heavy duty steel plate (e.g. 1/2" thick) in order to
withstand
the high vacuum pressures developed therein. The tank 10 further
comprises
top wall 60 and bottom wall 62, and front and rear walls 64 and 66,
respectively. </p>
  <p>In the front wall 64 of tank 10 is positioned a coupling 68 for
mating
the heater hose 32 with the internal copper conduit 36. The tank 10 is
also provided with a pair of vertically oriented planar support plates
70 and 72 which are positioned somewhat inwardly of the side walls 56
and
58 and are substantially parallel thereto. Support plates 70 and 72
lend
structural integrity to the tank 10 and are also provided with a
plurality
of openings 74 (FIG. 2) at the bottom portions thereof to permit fluid
communication therethrough. The bottom of the tank 10 is generally
filled
with from one to five gallons of gasoline, and the walls of the tank 10
along with plates 70 and 72 define three tank chambers 76, 78 and 80
which
are, by virtue of openings 74, in fluid communication with one another.
  </p>
  <p>In the top wall 60 of tank 10 is formed an opening 82 for placing
one
end of vapor conduit 14 in fluid communication with the interior
chamber
76 of tank 10. A second opening 84 is positioned in the top wall 60 of
tank 10 over which the air inlet control valve 12 is positioned. The
valve
assembly 12 comprises a pair of conventional butterfly valves 86 and 88
which are coupled via a control rod 90 to a control arm 92. Control arm
92 is, in turn, pivoted under the control of a cable 24 and is movable
between a solid line position indicated in FIG. 2 by reference numeral
92 and a dotted line position indicated in FIG. 2 by reference numeral
92'. </p>
  <p>Rod 90 and valves 86 and 88 are journaled in a housing 94 having a
base
plate 96 which is mounted on a cover 98. As seen in FIG. 1, the base
plate
96 includes a plurality of small air intake ports or apertures 100
formed
on both sides of the butterfly valves 86 and 88, which are utilized for
a purpose to become more clear hereinafter. </p>
  <p>Rod 90 is also journaled in a flange 102 which is mounted to cover
98,
while a return spring 104 for control arm 92 is journaled to cover 98
via
flange 106. </p>
  <p>Extending through the baffle and support plates 70 and 72 from the
side
chambers 78 and 80 of tank 10 to be in fluid communication with
apertures
100 are a pair of air conduits 108 and 110 each having a reed valve 112
and 114 positioned at the ends thereof for controlling air and vapor
flow
therethrough. The reed valves 112 and 114 cooperate with the small
apertures
100 formed in the base plate 96 to provide the proper amount of air
into
the tank 10 while the engine is idling and the butterfly valves 86 and
88 are closed. </p>
  <p>Mounted to the front wall 64 of tank 10 is a pivot support member
132
for pivotally receiving a filter element which is indicated generally
by
reference numeral 134 and is illustrated in a perspective, partially
cut
away view in FIG. 5. The unique, pivotable filter element 134 comprises
a frame member 136 having a pin-receiving stub 138 extending along one
side member thereof. The actual filter material contained within the
frame
136 comprises a layer of carbon particles 148 which is sandwiched
between
a pair of layers of sponge-like filter material which may, for example,
comprise neoprene. The neoprene layers 144 and 146 and carbon particles
148 are maintained in place by top and bottom screen elements 140 and
142
which extend within and are secured by frame member 136. A thick-walled
rubber hose 150 having a central annulus 151 is secured to the top of
screen
140 so as to mate with opening 82 of top wall 60 (see FIG. 2) when the
filter assembly 134 is in its solid line operative position illustrated
in FIG. 2. In the latter position, it may be appreciated that the vapor
conduit 14 draws vapor fumes directly from the filter element 134,
rather
than from the interior portion 76 of tank 10. In contradistinction,
when
the filter element 134 is in its alternate operative position,
indicated
by dotted lines in FIG. 2, the vapor conduit 14 draws fumes mainly from
the interior portions 76, 78 and 80 of tank 10. </p>
  <p>FIG. 4 is an enlarged view of one of the reed valve assemblies 114
which
illustrates the manner in which the valve opens and closes in response
to the particular vacuum pressure created within the tank 10. The
valves
112 and 114 are designed to admit just enough air to the tank 10 from
the
apertures 100 at engine idle to prevent the engine from stalling. </p>
  <p>Referring now to FIGS. 6 through 8, the vapor equalizer chamber 16
of
the present invention is seen to include front and rear walls 152 and
154,
respectively, a top wall 156, a side wall 158, and another side wall
160.
The vapor equalizer chamber 16 is secured to the manifold 18 as by a
plurality
of bolts 162 under which may be positioned a conventional gasket 164. </p>
  <p>In the top wall 156 of the vapor equalizer 16 is formed an opening
166
for communicating the outlet end of vapor conduit 14 with a mixing and
equalizing chamber 168. Adjacent the mixing and equalizing chamber 168
in wall 154 is formed another opening 170 which communicates with
ambient
air via opening 178 formed in the upper portion of housing 176. The
amount
of air admitted through openings 178 and 170 is controlled by a
conventional
butterfly valve 172. Butterfly valve 172 is rotated by a control rod
180
that, in turn, is coupled to a control arm 182. Cable 26 is connected
to
the distal end of control arm 182 and acts against the return bias of
spring
184, the latter of which is journaled to side plate 152 of vapor
equalizer
16 via an upstanding flange 188. Reference numeral 186 indicates
generally
a butterfly valve operating linkage, as illustrated more clearly in
FIG.
8, and which is conventional as may be appreciated by a person of
ordinary
skill in the art. </p>
  <p>Positioned below mixing and equalizing chamber 168 is a filter
unit
which is indicated generally by reference numeral 188. The filter unit
188, which is illustrated in an exploded view in FIG. 11, comprises a
top
plastic fluted cover 190 and a bottom plastic fluted cover 192.
Positioned
adjacent the top and bottom covers 190 and 192 are a pair of screen
mesh
elements 194 and 196, respectively. Positioned between the screen mesh
elements 194 and 196 is a support member 198 which is preferably formed
of a sponge-like filter material, such as, for example, neoprene. The
support
member 199 has formed on the top and bottom surfaces thereof a pair of
receptacles 200 and 202, respectively, whose diameters are sized
similarly
to the opening 166 in top plate 156 and the openings formed in the
intake
manifold 18 which are respectively indicated by reference numerals 210
and 212 in FIG. 6. </p>
  <p>Positioned in receptacles 200 and 202 are carbon particles 204 and
206,
respectively, for vapor retardation and control purposes. </p>
  <p>Referring now to FIG. 9, the filter unit 38 mounted in vapor
conduit
14 is illustrated in a longitudinal sectional view and is seen to
comprise
an outer flexible cylindrical hose 214 which is adapted to connect with
hose 14 at both ends by a pair of adapter elements 216 and 218.
Contained
within the outer flexible hose 214 is a cylindrical container 220,
preferably
of plastic, that houses in the central portion thereof a mixture of
carbon
and neoprene filter fibers 222. At both ends of the mixture 222 are
deposited
carbon particles 224 and 226, while the entire filtering unit is held
within
the container 220 by end screens 228 and 230 which permit passage of
vapors
therethrough while holding the carbon particles 224 and 226 in place. </p>
  <p>FIG. 10 illustrates one form of the thrust adjustment valve 40
which
is placed within line 14. The valve simply controls the amount of fluid
passable through the conduit 14 via a rotating valve member 41. </p>
  <p>In operation, the thrust adjustment valve 40 is initially adjusted
to
achieve as smooth an idle as possible for the particular motor vehicle
in which the system is installed. The emergency shut-off valve 42,
which
is closed when the engine is off, generally traps enough vapor between
it and the vapor equalizer 16 to start the engine 20. Initially, the
rear
intake valves 12 on the tank 10 are fully closed, while the air intake
valves 22 on the equalizer 16 are open to admit a charge of air to the
vapor equalizer prior to the vapor from the tank, thus forcing the
pre-existing
vapor in the vapor equalizer into the manifold. The small apertures 100
formed in base plate 96 on tank 10 admit just enough air to actuate the
reed valves to permit sufficient vapor and air to be drawn through
vapor
conduit 14 and equalizer 16 to the engine 20 to provide smooth idling.
The front air valves 22 are always set ahead of the rear air valves 12
and the linkages 24 and 26 are coupled to throttle pedal 28 such that
the
degree of opening of front valves 22 always exceeds the degree of
opening
of the rear valves 12. </p>
  <p>Upon initial starting of the engine 20, due to the closed
condition
of rear valves 12, a high vacuum pressure is created within tank 10
which
causes the filter assembly 134 positioned in tank 10 to rise to its
operative
position indicated by solid outline in FIG. 2. In this manner, a
relatively
small amount of vapor will be drawn directly from filter 134 through
vapor
conduit 14 to the engine to permit the latter to run on an extremely
lean
mixture. </p>
  <p>Upon initial acceleration, the front air intake valve 22 will open
further,
while the rear butterfly assembly 12 will begin to open. The latter
action
will reduce the vacuum pressure within tank 10 whereby the filter
assembly
134 will be lowered to its alternate operating position illustrated in
dotted outline in FIG. 2. In this position, the lower end of the filter
assembly 134 may actually rest in the liquid gasoline contained within
the tank 10. Accordingly, upon acceleration, the filter assembly 134 is
moved out of direct fluid communication with the opening 82 such that
the
vapor conduit 14 then draws fuel vapor and air from the entire tank 10
to provide a richer combustion mixture to the engine, which is
necessary
during acceleration. </p>
  <p>When the motor vehicle attains a steady speed, and the operator
eases
off the accelerator pedal 28, the rear butterfly valve assembly 12
closes,
but the front air intake 22 remains open to a certain degree. The
closing
of the rear air intake 12 increases the vacuum pressure within tank 10
to the point where the filter assembly 134 is drawn up to its initial
operating
position. As illustrated, in this position, the opening 82 is in
substantial
alignment with the aperture 151 of hose 150 to place the filter unit
134
in direct fluid communication with the vapor conduit 14, thereby
lessening
the amount of vapor and air mixture fed to the engine. Any vapor fed
through
conduit 14 while the filter 134 is at this position is believed to be
drawn
directly off the filter unit itself. </p>
  <p>I have been able to obtain extremely high gas mileages with the
system
of the present invention installed on a V-8 engine of a conventional
1971
American made automobile. In fact, mileage rates in excess of one
hundred
miles per gallon have been achieved with the present invention. The
present
invention eliminates the need for conventional fuel pumps, carburetors,
and gas tanks, thereby more than offsetting whatever the components of
the present invention might otherwise add to the cost of a car. The
system
may be constructed with readily available components and technology,
and
may be supplied in kit form as well as original equipment. </p>
  <p>Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present
invention
are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, although
described
in connection with the operation of a motor vehicle, the present
invention
may be universally applied to any four-stroke engine for which its
operation
depends upon the internal combustion of fossil fuels. Therefore, it is
to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims the
invention
may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein. </p>

  <p><b><font size="+1">"Tom Ogle Dead at 26"</font></b></p>
  </center>
  <p>Tom Ogle who astounded the automobile world in 1977 with his
"Oglemobile",
died Aiugust 19, 1981. According to an investigator his death was
attributed
to alcohol and an "overdose" of Darvon. There are a few HMC [High
Mileage
Carburetor] people who feel that although his death appears to be
accidental,
it was really a well orchestrated plan to play on the young mechanics's
weaknesss for self-destruction... </p>
  <p>Was his death accidental? David L. Williamson, President of
Advanced
Combustion Systems writes, "Whether directly or indirectly, Tom Ogle
died
as a result of working on a fuel saving system. Information forwarded
to
us indicated that Tom had a silent partner who preceded him in death,
when
a car fell off the jack stands on top of him. After his partner's
untimely
death Tom boarded up his car care center and went into hiding." </p>
  <p>Helga Armstrong, tom's mother, is quoted as saying that drinking
and
taking tranquilizers had become a way of life for her son. She also
said
that her son owed money to Tom Strayer and he was scared to death. </p>
  <p>His attorney, Bobby Perel is quoted as saying that Strayer had
forced
Ogle to sign away 22 percent of his royalties to the gas-saving
vaporizer
fuel system he invented. "There was a group of professional gamblers
and
they got him drunk and just hustled him for everything he was worth." </p>
  <p>Ray Covey, an El Paso building designer and inventor of the Covey
Vapor
System, ran into Ogle in February of 1981. Covey adn several builders
had
gone into a local bar for a beer and Tom was there playing pool for
$1,000
per game. "Every time he lost he doubled his bet and when we left he
was
playing for $18,000." </p>
  <p>According to an El Paso newspaper, Tom had been arrested for
reckless
driving and illegal possession of a firearm and at one point was shot
outside
a bar. </p>

  <br>
  <b>by Stuart the Maniac</b></p>
  </center>
  <p>On May 1, 1977, the El Paso Times carried a banner headline that
stated,
"200 Miles On Two Gallons Of Gas." A local inventor had come up with a
device that was a substitute for the carburetor of an automobile and
the
device would get incredible gas mileages. Not only did the device save
money on gas, but the emissions that came out of the vehicle tested
were
so clean that the inventor claimed you could "dry your hair" with the
exhaust! </p>
  <p>Thomas Hans Werner Peter Wolfgang Dinglestadt Ogle, an youthful
inventor
of German descent, had noticed one day that when he punctured a hole in
a lawn mower gas tank, the mower kept running off of the gasoline
vapors
for quite a while after he connected a line from the tank directly to
the
carburetor. Ogle theorized that he could use this principle to create a
device that, instead of preparing a fuel/air mixture for the engine to
burn, would make it so that the engine burned the gasoline vapors. Ogle
created such a device and mounted it inside of a 1970 Ford Galaxie. The
inventor notified the press that he was going to travel from El Paso,
Texas
to Deming, New Mexico on no more than two gallons of gas; this was a
trip
of over 200 miles! Reporters inspected the car for hidden tanks or
hoses,
and none were found. Prior to going public with his device, Ogle had
previously
gone taken a trip of about 280 miles in a similarly-equipped 1972
Thunderbird,
also with only two miles of gas. Ogle went on to fit several other cars
with his device. </p>
  <p>After the media reported the seemingly astonishing feat, skeptics
stepped
out of the woodwork to denounce the apparent impossibility of the feat.
Physics professors indicated that it was impossible to use the fuel
that
efficiently and that the claims must have been exaggerated. Engineers
stated
that there must have been hidden fuel sources, and that the trip was a
hoax. Ogle allowed at least two different inspections of his car and
the
device he installed. Registered state engineer Frank Haynes Jr.
conducted
one inspection, and another inspection was conducted by Professor John
Whitacre and Professor Garry Hawkins from the Mechanical Engineering
department
at the University of Texas at El Paso. Both inspections indicated that
the device did what Ogle represented that it did; that is, that the
device
allowed the old car that Ogle used in his run to Deming to get in
excess
of 100 miles per gallon. </p>
  <p>At this point, Ogle was on top of the world. As the inventor of an
energy-saving
device that cleaned up emissions to the point that there was
almost nothing but a small amount of water coming out of the tailpipe,
it seemed that the device he made would revolutionize the automobile
industry.
At
the time, the country was in the midst of the "energy crisis", or the
political decision by President Jimmy Carter to attempt to conserve
finite fossil fuel resources to try to avoid an unforeseen disaster in
the
future due to a shortfall. However, the device never came to be. At
this
point in time,
there does not exist a single mass-produced vehicle that carries the
device Ogle invented. What happened in the meantime? </p>
  <p>Ogle invited U.S. Congressman Richard White to view the operation
of
the device along with an official from the National Energy Research and
Development Administration, who expressed enthusiastic interest in
the invention. However, word began to circulate that there were
previous
patents
for similar devices. Of course, this would not have been an
insurmountable
obstacle, since if someone had stepped forth with a claim on a patent
for
a
previous device, Ogle could have entered into negotiations to pay a
royalty to the holder of the previous patent. Rumors swirled around
indicating
that General Motors had patented such a device several years earlier;
however,
there was no public evidence that anyone had made any claim to hold a
competing patent. </p>
  <p>The bright future that Ogle foresaw quickly began evaporating.
Perhaps
no one will ever truly know what happened that led to the further
troubles
that the inventor experienced after this point, but some facts are
known.
Ogle and a partner named James Peck, who had assisted Ogle with
financing
the development of his device, ran into some minor difficulties in
working
out a contractual agreement as to the distribution of royalties. The
two
had a falling-out, but Ogle continued marketing the device. In the
meantime,
Frank Read, another inventor who had come up with a similar device that
didn't get near the gas mileage that Ogle had gotten and whose device
did
not completely bypass the carburetor, went public with the news that he
had been hit with several lawsuits, including one from the Texas
Attorney
General's office for consumer fraud. </p>
  <p>Around this same time, the official from the NERDA who had
previously
viewed the device with Congressman White began indicating that he did
not
think development of the device would be feasible. The official had
previously
indicated some enthusiasm for the device, and the turn-around in his
attitude
was fairly mysterious. Ogle became involved in several lawsuits that
drained
his time and energy. The young inventor's newly opened business began
failing. </p>
  <p>More trouble from the government began descending on Ogle. The
Securities
and Exchange Commission served a firm with which Ogle had contracted
for
marketing rights with an injunction alleging anti-trust and
registration
violations. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service served Ogle with
a federal tax lien for over $20,000 after an audit. Ogle was virtually
paralyzed in the further development and marketing of his device. </p>
  <p>Rumors circulated that the young inventor was turning to alcohol
and
drugs after his legal problems. Ogle became increasingly more paranoid,
and was
arrested after being chased by the police. Then, in mid-1981, Ogle
was shot and wounded outside a bar. Ogle was placed under police
protection
after the shooting, believing that he was being targeted for attack.
Ogle
indicated to the police that he had been shot by a Hispanic individual
in a red car, but no suspects or leads were ever found in the incident.
  </p>
  <p>Ogle had been gravitating toward gambling at the pool table, and
began
losing a lot of money in his gambling forays. He indicated to his
attorney,
Bobby Perel, that he believed people were drugging his drinks. Perel
was
skeptical, but on August 19, 1981, Ogle collapsed and died from what an
autopsy showed was an overdose of Darvon and alcohol. The death was
ruled
to be a suicide after a cursory investigation, but several people close
to Ogle indicated that they did not believe that Ogle would or could
kill
himself. </p>
  <p>The truth may never be known about what happened to Tom Ogle in
between
the time that he went public with his invention and the time of his
untimely
death. However, several unanswered questions remain. Who shot Tom Ogle
outside the bar and why? Why did the SEC and the IRS cause problems for
the inventor? Why did the NERDA suddenly indicate a loss of support for
the device? And, last but not least, why is there not such a device
installed
inside every fuel-hogging car today to save the consumers gas mileage
and
to postpone the dwindling of our finite fossil-fuel resources? Where
are
the cars that had been fitted with the device? The world may never know
the answers to these questions... </p>
