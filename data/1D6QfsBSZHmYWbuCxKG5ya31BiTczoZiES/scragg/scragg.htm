      <p>Reported in the Washington Star recently was the astounding
        news that the Solar Reactor Corp. of Miami has solved just about
        all of man's energy problems forever through a process even the
        inventor doesn't understand. The company says any amount of
        energy can be produced at virtually no cost and with no
        environmental problems. Although company spokesmen say they
        don't like the term, what they described at a recent news
        conference in Washington is a perpetual motion machine that
        produces more energy than it consumes, a process that seems to
        violate the generally accepted laws of physics. Apparently,
        hydrogen and chlorine are pumped into a container where, in the
        presence of oxygen, they are exposed to some source of energy --
        perhaps artificial light, the sun, or low-level radiation from
        nuclear waste. The result is an ionized hydrochloric gas
        containing great amounts of energy which can then be recovered
        for use through a turbine or other means. it is kinetic energy,
        not heat energy, so the process is cool and easy to use. The
        tests have used artificial light because sunlight is too
        powerful and the people involved are scared about what might
        happen if it were used. The process was invented by Robert L.
        Scragg of West Virginia, and the company said it would not
        accept money from the public but is looking for private backers
        to raise the $5 million needed to create an operational
        prototype. They expect to be in production within two or three
        years.<br>

      <p><i>UPI ~ Ships, locomotives and airliners that carry no fuel.
          An automobile uses only a small supply of hydrochloric acid as
          a power medium -- over and over again. A power plant generates
          electricity without consuming coal, petroleum or uranium.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Fantasy or real possibilities? </p>
      <p>A Miami engineering firm has several small internal combustion
        engines already being run in this manner on ultraviolet light
        without requiring any real fuel. </p>
      <p>A California engineer says he is preparing to use an
        ultraviolet laser to extract hydrogen from water continually to
        power an automobile. </p>
      <p>No firm answer can yet be given to the question of whether
        either process is the key to solving the world's energy
        problems. But the leading article in the may Scientific American
        by Prof. Avigdor N. Ronn of Brooklyn College, entitled "Laser
        Chemistry", makes it clear that chemists around the world are
        working busily trying to use the energy of light as opposed to
        heat, the source of all energy up to now. </p>
      <p>If it turns out as chemists are starting to believe, that light
        can trigger controlled chemical reactions to produce enormously
        more energy than any thermal reaction from fossil fuel, then man
        indeed could be on the threshold of a truly unlimited source of
        energy. We could stop using coal or petroleum for fuel and
        reserve it all for chemical feedstocks, particularly for
        fertilizer chemicals to produce food. </p>
      <p>The bitter issue over nuclear power would subside for nuclear
        power simply no longer would be needed. Uranium, henceforth,
        would be useful only for making weapons. </p>
      <p>The supply of light in nature is unlimited, and artificial
        light in the small amounts needed to set off chemical reactions
        to produce large amounts of energy can be obtained easily and
        cheaply from an ordinary automobile generator and storage
        battery. </p>
      <p>The Miami firm that is running small engines on ultraviolet
        light is Solar Reactor Corp., headed by Robin Parker. It is
        working on a reaction discovered partly by accident by Robert
        Scragg, an inventor. Scragg learned that ultraviolet light can
        set off a reaction between hydrogen and chlorine producing many
        times as much mechanical energy in a small engine as gasoline or
        diesel fuel. </p>
      <p>Further, the reaction can be produced in a closed loop with the
        small amount of hydrochloric acid used over and over again like
        the vapor medium in a Rankine cycle steam engine. </p>
      <p>The actual energy used in the reaction comes from small
        ultraviolet light plugs resembling spark plugs made for Solar
        Reactor by Champion Spark Plug Co. </p>
      <p>It looks like the nearest thing to perpetual motion yet
        achieved although it isn't really that. Parker and Scragg have
        no yet built the closed loop but they say it can be built out of
        off-the-shelf hardware available from several chemical equipment
        manufacturers. </p>
      <p>So far they have operated a Honda 4-cycle motorcycle engine,
        two small Tecumseh appliance engines, and a tiny turbine engine
        they built themselves by the method. </p>
      <p>Parker says they are planning to build a closed loop light
        engine for an automobile, one for a boat, and one for a
        stationary motor-generator set. Ordinary 4-cycle engines will be
        used. They have to be modified because no compression stroke is
        needed, but the valves are needed. The engines will fire like a
        2-cycle engine, thus doubling the mechanical energy output. </p>
      <p>All this will take time and money, which must be raised.
        Parker, who is an architect by profession, says the 10 owners of
        Solar Reactor are willing to license the process free to any
        company who will proceed to put it to work, but they will not
        license it to anyone who wants to delay action. </p>
      <p>Scragg made his discovery after realizing that all solar energy
        research up to now has been concerned with thermal energy, or
        the infrared end of the electromagnetic spectrum whereas light
        contains more energy. It is light, not heat, that makes plants
        grow. Light has the energy to move itself at a speed of 186,000
        miles a second. This led him to think about the laser, a device
        for utilizing light energy invented some 20 years ago. But the
        laser is a very expensive device and has never lived up to
        original expectations. [This was written in 1979] </p>
      <p>Then one day he ran across a report published in the 1920s by a
        graduate student saying that, in the presence of ordinary
        ultraviolet light, hydrogen and chlorine react with extreme
        violence to produce vast amounts of energy. Scragg was
        staggered. </p>
      <p>Scragg experimented successfully, then sought backers.
        Hydrochloric acid is easily made from seawater, is easily broken
        down into hydrogen and chlorine, and easily put back together.
        It takes as much energy to extract it from water as the energy
        it contains, but what difference does that make of you can use
        it over and over again more or less indefinitely? </p>
      <p>Brooklyn College's Dr. Ronn said he knows Scragg and has
        discussed his discovery with him. Ronn said it may have all the
        potential Scragg believes, but it will take a lot of time and
        money to prove it. </p>
      <p>The closed loop is essential to prolonged operation of the
        light engine, not only to avoid consuming the hydrogen and
        chlorine but to prevent an exhaust. An exhaust from such an
        engine would be quite toxic and corrosive. </p>
      <p>Scragg and Parker estimate that an automobile powered by a
        light engine would carry one to three gallons of hydrochloric
        acid in its closed loop system. The acid would pass through a
        converter to be broken down into hydrogen and chlorine and the
        separate gases then would be fed into the engine's cylinders and
        would react together as the ultraviolet plugs emitted light,
        creating an expansion to drive the pistons. Acceleration and
        deceleration would be controlled by a rheostat varying the
        timing of the light plugs, not by varying the flow of the gases.
      </p>
      <p>Even though the reaction is induced by light instead of heat,
        the temperature in the center of the cylinder reaches 1,000
        degrees Fahrenheit. The thermal energy thus created without
        combustion is at least four times that of a gasoline engine and
        the mechanical energy appears to be up to 14 times as high as a
        gasoline engine of the same size. </p>
      <p>At 1,000 F., gaseous hydrochloric acid is not corrosive to
        metals, but as the gas leaves the cylinders it goes through a
        scrubber to return it to liquid hydrochloric acid to renew the
        cycle. </p>
      <p>Scragg and Parker concede that they do not fully understand
        what happens inside one of their engines when they are running,
        and that the action appears to violate some of the accepted laws
        of thermodynamics. That is one reason so much work must be done.</p>

      <p><i>On March, 1979, an exciting discovery regarding the use of
          hydrogen as a fuel was made by a Miami-based firm called Solar
          Reactor Corporation. The basic process was first discovered in
          1975 by Robert Scragg, a Miami inventor. The basic process and
          other aspects are now covered by seven US patents including
          coverage in 20 countries.</i> </p>
      <p><b>More Energetic Than Gasoline</b> </p>
      <p>How much energy can one expect to obtain by exploding hydrogen
        instead of gasoline? On an equal weight basis the normal
        hydrogen explosion produces approximately three times a much
        energy as gasoline. What does the new hydrogen process
        (involving hydrogen, chlorine and radiation) produce? Based on
        numerous recent careful tests made by two independent
        laboratories (one was H.P. White Laboratory, Belair, MD) the new
        process produces almost five times more kinetic (motion) energy
        than the explosion of hydrogen with oxygen. On the basis of an
        equal weight of fuel, the new hydrogen process produces 14 times
        more motion energy than gasoline. This is the highest energy
        output of any known process (other than nuclear reactions such
        as fusion or fission) </p>
      <p><b>How Tests Were Made</b> </p>
      <p>A series of precise side-by-side experiments were carefully
        carried out to determine the kinetic energies resulting when a
        projectile (wooden ball) was given a high impulse thrust out of
        a mortar using controlled explosions of hydrogen.
        Hydrogen-0xygen-arc radiation produced a normal explosion which
        propelled the wooden ball with predictable kinetic energy. A
        side-by side test using hydrogen-chlorine-arc radiation,
        identical in every way except for the substitution of oxygen,
        gave an impressive result: almost five times greater kinetic
        energy was obtained using hydrogen-chlorine-arc. The energies
        were determined from precise velocity measurements using
        standard ballistics techniques and electrical equipment. The
        overall test set-up is shown in the first photograph. Close-ups
        of the mortar, reactor, and projectile are shown in the other
        photographs. [Not included here] </p>
      <p><b>Significance Of Findings</b> </p>
      <p>(1) Virtually unlimited energy can be obtained by proper
        utilization of the process. Since hydrogen and chlorine are
        readily available from sea water, there is no shortage of fuel
        and oxidant. </p>
      <p>(2) Since the product of the explosion is primarily
        hydrochloric acid, the hydrogen and chlorine needed for the
        second cycle can be obtained from the product, suing known or
        improved electrolysis technology. In other words, the fuel can
        be recycled. </p>
      <p><b>Future Possibilities</b> </p>
      <p>(1) Since the yield of kinetic energy is extremely high, very
        efficient lightweight kinetic engines can be used with this
        process. Thus the process can be applied to internal combustion
        engines, rotary engines, rockets, and gas turbines. </p>
      <p>(2) Since plasma (mixture of ions and electrons) is produced in
        the explosion, the process can be used to obtain byproduct
        electrical current (for example, using a magnetohydrodynamic
        generator). </p>
      <p>(3) Since the kinetic energy is extremely high, electricity can
        be generated on a small scale (50 kilowatts) as well as on a
        large scale (1,000 megawatts).</p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A solar reactor steam generator is
        disclosed which includes a concrete housing with reactor
        chamber, tubular heat exchanger, solar sight glass, and solar
        intensifier. In one embodiment, the reactor chamber is
        cylindrical. Inside the chamber is a heat exchanger which
        consists of a single pass helical tube stack which absorbs and
        conducts convective, conductive, and radiated heats of reactions
        to liquids or vapors inside the tube. A solar intensifier, such
        as a parabolic reflector, is mounted on top of the reactor
        housing. It collects and intensifies solar rays, then guides
        them down through a solar sight glass, mounted in top of the
        housing, into the reactor chamber, onto a reflector cone which
        disperses solar rays throughout the chamber. Hydrogen, chlorine,
        and atmospheric oxygen are piped into the reactor chamber via
        tubing. The hydrogen and chlorine react with controlled
        explosive violence when exposed to the solar rays. It should be
        understood that high intensity lamps can be used in the absence
        of solar rays. In another embodiment of this invention,
        carbonaceous blocks with single pass tube configurations are
        used in a rectangular reactor chamber. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> <br>
        <b>Background of the Invention:</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to reactors and boilers and more
        specifically to solar reactors and boilers utilizing tungsten
        carbide tubing and silicon carbide blocks with tube
        configurations as mediums for absorbing conductive, convective,
        and compression heats, and infrared radiation; and utilizes
        gaseous or liquid hydrogen and chlorine as reactants. </p>
      <p>In the process of generating steam for power turbines or for
        other processes, two basic methods are used to produce heat for
        generating steam. One is external or atmospheric combustion of
        fossil fuels which conducts and convects heats of combustion
        around or through fire or water tube boilers. A second method is
        the internal reaction of nuclear radiation which radiates,
        conducts, and convects radiated heat into exchange mediums that
        conduct and convect the heats to water tube or vessel boilers.
        Both of these systems have several factors in common when used
        as primary heat sources in large utility power generation, i.e.,
        they can't be turned on and off, cooled or heated on a cyclic
        basis to meet consumer load demands placed on utilities.
        Therefore, they generate a surplus of power during low demand
        periods, i.e., from 10:00 P.M. to 6:00 A.M., and do not generate
        enough power during high demand periods such as from 6:00 A.M.
        to 10:00 P.M. Both of these systems are restricted to utilizing
        only conducted and convected heats directly to the heated tube
        or vessel exchange mediums. In addition, both of these systems
        are hazardous to the environment and are limited in efficiency
        due to the heat exchange mediums available sources of combustion
        and radiation known in the art. </p>
      <p>It therefore is an object of this invention to provide a method
        for generating steam for power turbines during daylight high
        load demand periods. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method of

      <p><b>Short Statement of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, this invention relates to a solar reactor steam
        generator method and apparatus and its application in the
        electrical power generating process and includes a method of
        producing fuels and/or reactants for the solar reactor. An
        electrical power generator provides AC power to a power
        rectifier which thereby produces direct current. The direct
        current powers a chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis cell.
        Hydrogen produced by the cell is compressed and stored until
        needed. Chlorine produced by the cell is compressed and also
        stored until needed. Sodium hydroxide and sodium chloride
        produced by the cell are used for suitable processes as desired.
        During daylight hours, solar rays are received by a parabolic
        reflector or other suitable focusing means which is controlled
        by an automated azimuth tracker. The parabolic reflector
        concentrates the solar rays into an intense focal point
        reflector whih reflects the intense solar beam via a series of
        reflectors, through a solar sight glass into the reactor
        chamber, and onto the surface of a conical reflector at the base
        of the chamber which disperses the solar rays throughout the
        chamber. Hydrogen and chlorine from the storage tanks are fed
        into the solar reactor chamber, which is cylindrical and
        contains a helical tube stack pressed against the chamber wall.
        Water is fed into the base port of the tube stack. The hydrogen
        and chlorine react with controlled explosive violence when
        exposed to intensified solar rays thereby producing intense heat
        within the chamber. The heat vaporizes the water in the tube
        stack, producing steam at the top tube port. The steam is fed to
        the power turbine where it is used in the power generating
        process. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of this invention, a rectangular reactor
        chamber is provided with carbonaceous blocks containing a fluid
        conducting tube therein. In this embodiment a pyramid reflector
        at the base of the chamber is utilized. </p>

      <p><b>Detailed Description of the Embodiments</b> </p>
      <p>Throughout the detailed description of the embodiments of the
        present invention, like numerals will correspond to like
        elements in the figures. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 1 where there is disclosed a section view of
        the one embodiment of the solar reactor steam generator. Fuel
        and/or reactants are fed into the solar reactor chamber 32 via
        tubes 21 and 22. In the preferred embodiment chlorine is fed
        into the reactor via tube 22 and hydrogen via tube 21 at
        controlled rates. Atmospheric oxygen is fed into the cylindrical
        chamber 32 via tube 23 under the base of conical reflector 24.
        Water is fed into the exchanger tubing 25 via tube 26. Solar
        rays are concentrated and intensified by an azimuth tracking
        parabolic reflector system such as is well known in the art.
        Solar radiation is received by a parabolic reflector 35 which
        tracks the sun by means of a conventional azimuth tracker 37.
        The parabolic reflector concentrates the solar rays into a focal
        point reflector 39 which reflects the intense solar beam via
        reflector 41 through the solar sight glass 27. The intensified
        solar rays are directed downward through solar sight glass 27,
        which is encased within the reactor chamber wall 28, and onto
        the surface of conical reflector 24, which disperses the intense
        solar rays onto the surface of the exchanger tubing 25. Hydrogen
        and chlorine gas emitted into the chamber 32 via tubes 21 and
        22, respectively, react with controlled explosive violence
        creating intense heat and pressure within the chamber 32.
        Pressure relief valve 29, shown schematically, release excessive
        pressure in chamber 32. Heat in the chamber 32 is transferred
        and absorbed in exchanger tube 25 by conductive, convective,
        compressive, and infrared radiation, thereby vaporizing the
        water in the tube 25. The vaporized water is exhausted into tube
        30 for utilization in a manner to be described more fully
        hereinbelow. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 2 where there is disclosed an alternate
        embodiment of the solar reactor steam generator. In this
        embodiment, exchanger tubes 25 are enclosed in silicon carbide
        blocks 31 which are mounted flush to the walls of rectangular
        chamber 32. The use of silicon carbide to generate steam is more
        fully disclosed in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No.
        534,588, filed Dec. 19, 1974 by the same inventors herewith. The
        subject of that application is hereby incorporated herein. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 3 where there is disclosed block diagram of
        fuel source 11, a power generator 12, a distribution system 19,
        a utilization means 20, a method of generating fuel and/or
        reactants via a power rectifier circuit 13, a chlorine-sodium
        hydroxide electrolysis cell 14, a chlorine compressor storage
        tank 15, a hydrogen compressor storage tank 16, a sodium
        hydroxide and sodium chloride process and storage tank 17, and
        the solar reactor steam generator 32 illustrated in FIGS. 1 and
        2. </p>
      <p>In operation a supply voltage from the alternating current
        power source 12 is fed to the power rectifier circuit 13. The
        power rectifier circuit 13 includes a step down transformer
        which converts the high voltage output of the generator 12 to a
        relatively low voltage. This voltage is then rectified to
        provide a direct current which preferably is in the range of,
        e.g., 3.6-3.75 volts, which is the typical operating range of
        the electrolysis cell 14. In the event the supply voltage is
        direct current, the power rectifier 13 is by-passed, and the DC
        voltage stepped down to the desired voltage range by suitable
        means known in the art. </p>
      <p>It should be understood that a low voltage high current
        generator, such as, for example, a homopolar generator, could be
        appropriately driven by a steam turbine to provide current to
        the electrolysis cell 14. The desired voltage, i.e., 3.6-3.75
        volts at the desired current level, depending on the size of the
        cell 14, is fed to the chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis
        cell 14. At the same time saline water, or brine, is pumped into
        the cell. Electrolysis then takes place and chlorine is formed
        at the cell anode while hydrogen is released at the cell
        cathode, leaving a 10-15% sodium hydroxide solution and a 10-15%
        sodium chloride solution in the cell liquor. Accordingly, 70 to
        80% of the saline water is converted to hydrogen and chlorine.
        The chlorine is compressed into storage tank 15. The hydrogen is
        compressed into storage tank 16. The hydrogen and chlorine are
        then fed to the solar reactor 32 at a controlled rate by
        suitable means known in the art. The sodium hydroxide and sodium
        chloride are fed into process storage tank 17, then used in
        other processes as desired. The hydrogen is fed into the solar
        reactor chamber 32 via tube 21. The chlorine is fed into the
        solar reactor chamber 32 via tube 22. Atmospheric oxygen is fed
        into the solar reactor chamber 32 from storage tank 33 via tube
        23. Water is fed from chlorine treated water storage tank 34 via
        tube 26 into the heat exchanger tubes 25. Intensified solar rays
        are directed through sight glass 27, illustrated in FIGS. 1 and
        2, into the reactor chamber 32 onto the conical reflector 24
        which disperses the solar rays onto the surface of the exchanger
        tubes 25. The solar rays bring about a reaction of controlled
        explosive violence between the hydrogen and chlorine, emitting
        conductive, convective, compressive, and infrared heat. The heat
        is absorbed by the exchanger tubes 25, vaporizing the water and
        discharging steam via tube 30 which is then fed to power
        generator 12 to drive power turbines. Pressure relief valve 29
        provides a means for releasing excessive pressures that build up
        in the reactor chamber 32. The hydrogen chloride exhausted by
        valve 29 is channeled to an appropriate mechanism for converting
        the hydrogen chloride to acid or other appropriate compounds as
        desired. </p>
      <p>While the preferred embodiment of applicant's invention has
        been disclosed, it would be appreciated that there may be other
        alternate embodiments of applicants' invention which fall within
        the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended

      <p><b>Abstract&nbsp; -- </b>A solar reactor engine is disclosed
        which includes a concrete or other suitable housing having a
        reactor chamber therein. In one embodiment, the reactor chamber
        is cylindrical. A solar intensifier, such as a parabolic
        reflector, is mounted on top of the reactor housing. The
        parabolic reflector collects and intensifies solar rays and
        guides them down through a solar sight glass, mounted on top of
        the housing, into the reactor chamber. The concentrated beam of
        light is directed onto a reflector cone within the reactor
        chamber which disperses solar rays throughout the chamber.
        Hydrogen and chlorine are conducted into the reactor chamber and
        react with controlled explosive violence when exposed to the
        solar rays. Oxygen is used as a control medium to regulate the
        energy given off by the reaction of the hydrogen and chlorine in
        the presence of solar energy. The heat and pressure thus formed
        are utilized to drive a turbine, the output of which is utilized
        to drive a suitable utilization device. In another embodiment of
        the invention, the solar reactor engine is housed in a metal or
        other suitable housing so that the reactor engine can be
        utilized for propulsion or mobile applications. <br>

      <p><b>Background of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention is a continuation-in-part of copending
        application Ser. No. 564,087, filed Apr. 1, 1975, and titled
        Solar Reactor Steam Generator Method and Apparatus. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to reactors and turbines and more
        particularly is related to solar reactors and gas turbines which
        utilize the controlled energies developed by the combination of
        hydrogen and chlorine in the presence of solar energy to convert
        this photo-chemical energy into mechanical and/or electrical
        power. </p>
      <p>In the process of converting energy into mechanical and
        electrical power, many forms of primary movers, i.e. energy
        converters, have been utilized. The most widely used converters
        are gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines and gas turbine
        engines. All of these engines convert fossil fuel into kinetic
        energy which is then converted directly to mechanical power.
        Another example of a common converter commonly used in the art
        is the steam boiler. The steam boiler converts fossil energy
        into kinetic energy which is then converted to mechanical power
        by means of steam turbines. It is a characteristic of all of the
        above-identified energy converters that their efficiency does
        not exceed 40%. Thus, only 40% of the input BTUs in fuel is
        converted to output horsepower. Further, each of the
        aforementioned engines operates with detrimental environmental
        effects; and all are dependent upon fossil fuels or refined
        fossil fuels which require tremendous capital investments for
        recovery, refining and distribution. </p>
      <p>It therefore is an object of this invention to provide a method
        for converting photo-chemical energy to mechanical and/or
        electrical power in sufficient quantity for direct or
        supplemental utility operation. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method of
        utilizing fuels and reactants, which can be produced by
        electrolysis cells and stored wherever electrical power is
        available, whether it be in stored or generated capacity. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of utilizing the explosive energies of reactant gases such as
        hydrogen and chlorine to drive a gas turbine. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method of
        evacuating exhaust gases to thereby reduce the back pressure of
        a gas turbine engine thereby resulting in higher efficiencies
        for the engine. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of generating power in the form of a prime mover or electrical
        generator which generates no harmful emissions. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of generating power in the form of a prime mover or electrical
        generator which is more efficient than existing energy
        converters. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide a method of
        generating power in the form of a prime mover or electrical
        generator that does not utilize fossil or nuclear fuels which
        may potentially pollute or otherwise harm the environment about
        the generator. </p>
      <p><b>Short Statement of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly the present invention is related to a solar reactor
        engine which includes a solar reactor chamber having means for
        controllably coupling chlorine and hydrogen thereto. A parabolic
        reflector or other suitable focusing means is positioned with
        respect to the reactor chamber and is controlled by an automated
        azimuth tracker. The parabolic reflector concentrates the solar
        rays into an intense focal point reflector which reflects the
        solar beam via a series of reflectors through a solar sight
        glass and into the reactor chamber. The beam of light passes
        through the reactor chamber and onto the surface of a conical
        reflector at the base of the chamber which disperses the solar
        rays throughout the chamber. The hydrogen and chlorine coupled
        to the reactor chamber exothermicly react to generate hydrogen
        chloride at a high temperature and pressure level. A turbine is
        positioned on at least a portion of at least one wall of the
        reactor chamber with the pressurized hydrogen chloride driving
        the turbine. An exhaust chamber is positioned on the opposite
        side of the turbine from the reactor chamber wherein the
        hydrogen chloride is converted to hydrochloric acid to thereby
        form a partial vacuum in the exhaust chamber. The partial vacuum
        has the effect of creating an increased pressure differential
        across the turbine to thereby increase the efficiency of
        operation of the turbine. The hydrochloric acid is conveyed away
        from the exhaust chamber. </p>
      <p>In another aspect of the invention, batteries are provided for
        generating an electrical current which is coupled to a
        chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis cell. The electrical
        current coupled to the electrolysis cell causes the generation
        of chlorine and hydrogen therein which is coupled to the solar
        reactor. At the output of the exhaust chamber of the reactor
        engine the hydrogen chloride is reacted with sodium hydroxide to
        thereby produce water and sodium chloride. The water and sodium
        chloride are coupled back to the chlorine and sodium hydroxide
        electrolysis cell so that the cycle is continuously repeated. </p>

      <p><b>Detailed Description of the Embodiments</b> </p>
      <p>Throughout the detailed description of the embodiments of the
        present invention, like numeral will correspond to like elements
        in the Figures. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 1 where there is disclosed a simplified
        section view of one embodiment of the solar reactor engine of
        the present invention. Fuel and/or reactants are fed into a
        solar reactor chamber 32 via tubes 21 and 22. In the preferred
        embodiment chlorine is fed into the reactor via tube 22 and
        hydrogen via tube 21 at controlled rates. Oxygen is fed into
        chamber 32 via tube 23 under the base of a conical reflector 24.
      </p>
      <p>Solar rays are concentrated and intensified by an azimuth
        tracking parabolic reflector system such as is well known in the
        art. Solar radiation is received by a parabolic reflector 35
        which tracks the sun by means of a conventional azimuth tracker
        37. The parabolic reflector concentrates the solar rays into a
        focal point reflector 39 which reflects the intense solar beam
        via reflector 41 through a solar sight glass 27. The intensified
        solar rays are directed downward through solar sight glass 27,
        which is encased within the reactor chamber wall 28, and onto
        the surface of conical reflector 24, which disperses the intense
        solar rays onto the surface of the reactor walls. Hydrogen and
        chlorine gas emitted into the chamber 32 via tubes 21 and 22,
        respectively, react with controlled explosive violence creating
        hydrogen chloride gas and intense heat and pressure within
        chamber 32. The explosive pressures and heat thus generated are
        exhausted from chamber 32 into a vacuum reactor chamber 30 via
        gas turbine assembly 26. The gas turbine assembly may be of any
        suitable type known in the art depending of course on the power
        levels generated. As the hydrogen chloride gas enters the vacuum
        reactor chamber 30, tubes 29 generate water jets which spray
        into the chamber. Five hundred volumes of hydrogen chloride
        combine instantly with one volume of water and form hydrochloric
        acid. The reaction evacuates the chamber instantly, leaving
        hydrochloric acid in the base of the chamber. The hydrochloric
        acid drops via ports 40 into a sodium hydroxide-hydrochloric
        acid reactor 25. The sodium hydroxide is fed into reactor 25 via
        tube 38 from a chlorine-sodium hydroxide cell. The hydrochloric
        acid is mixed with the sodium hydroxide, producing water and
        sodium chloride. The water and sodium chloride are fed from
        reactor 25 to a chlorine-sodium hydroxide cell, via tube 43. The
        water and sodium chloride are converted into fuel and/or
        reactants, hydrogen and chlorine, and sodium hydroxide. The
        process is continuously repeated. </p>
      <p>The heat and pressure from reactor chamber 32 provide explosive
        energies to drive turbine assembly 26, which in turn drives a
        power generator via power take off 42. The evacuation chamber 30
        converts the exhaust gas, hydrogen chloride, into hydrochloric
        acid, creating a vacuum exhaust, increasing the efficiency of
        turbine assembly 26, and eliminates the necessity of atmospheric
        exhaust. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 2 where there is disclosed an alternative
        embodiment of the solar reactor engine of the present invention.
        In this embodiment the housing 28 is formed of a metallic
        material such as in a standard gas turbine engine wherein the
        engine is designed for propulsion or other mobile applications.
        The reactants such as hydrogen and chlorine are supplied by
        means of storage containers or can be generated on a continuous
        basis. In this embodiment rather than utilizing solar energy for
        sustained reaction in the reaction chamber 32, the light is
        generated by, for example, carbon arc ignitors 44 or other high
        intensity light sources. As before, the light generated by the
        high intensity light source 44 is directed into the chamber 32
        and against the conical reflector 24. The light is thus
        dispersed against the walls of the reaction chamber 32 to
        thereby sustain the combination of chlorine and hydrogen to form
        hydrogen chloride. The hydrogen chloride thus formed is at a
        high temperature and pressure level and is thereby forced
        through turbine blades 26 into the exhaust chamber 30. The
        turbine blades 26 are thereby rapidly driven with the mechanical
        energy thus generated coupled to a power take off 42 which may
        drive a mechanical means for moving a vehicle and in addition a
        portion of the mechanical power may be utilized to drive a
        generator 47. In the exhaust chamber 30, water is dispersed
        through tubes 29 to combine with the hydrogen chloride to form
        hydrochloric acid. This acid is conveyed away from the exhaust
        chamber 30 into a container 25. By combining the HCl with water
        a partial vacuum is created in the exhaust chamber 30 which
        assists in driving the turbine 26 because of the increased
        pressure differential thereacross. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 3 which is an alternate embodiment of the
        solar reactor engine of the present invention. As illustrated in
        this embodiment more than one reactor chamber is provided with
        each of the reactor chambers having hydrogen and chlorine
        coupled thereto together with oxygen for control purposes via
        select valves 51 which are sequentially operated. Each of the
        reaction chambers 32 has light energy coupled thereto from arc
        ignitors 44 or from concentrated solar energy. The combustion
        gases hydrogen coupled through line 21 and chlorine coupled
        through line 22 expand through check valves 53 into an expansion
        chamber 52. In this arrangement initial combustion is
        sequentially provided by each of the reactor chambers 32, the
        output of which is coupled to the expansion chamber 52 thereby
        increasing the pressure in expansion chamber 52. As in the
        previous embodiments, the high pressure hydrogen chloride thus
        formed drives the turbine 26, which in turn powers a take off
        unit 42 and a generator 47. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 4 where there is disclosed a block diagram of
        the solar reactor engine of the present invention wherein the
        solar reactor engine is formed as a part of an electrical
        utility power generation and storage system. The generation
        system is fully explained in copending U.S. patent application
        Ser. No. 564,087, filed Apr. 1, 1975 by the same inventors
        herewith. The subject matter of this application is incorporated
        herewith by reference. As illustrated in FIG. 4, a surplus
        electrical power generated during off peak demand periods is
        stored in a battery supply 45. This electrical energy is coupled
        to the chlorine sodium hydroxide electrolysis cell 14 to thereby
        generate chlorine and hydrogen which is coupled to the reactor
        chamber 32 via lines 21 and 22. As aforementioned, the output of
        the reactor chamber drives a turbine which in turn drives a
        power take off unit 42. The power take off unit 42 powers a
        generator 47 which generates electrical power during peak load
        demand periods so that in effect the electrical energy generated
        during off peak demand periods is recovered and utilized to
        provide peak load demands during periods of high power use in
        the utility system. In addition, the power take off unit 42
        drives an oxygen compressor unit 49 which supplys oxygen to the
        reactor 32 via line 23 to thereby control the reaction of the
        hydrogen and chlorine within the reactor in a known manner. As
        illustrated water is coupled to the exhaust chamber 30 via line
        29 with the output of the exhaust chamber being coupled to the
        hydrogen chloride converter unit 25. Coupled to the hydrogen
        chloride converter unit is sodium hydroxide from the
        electrolysis cell 14 via line 30a so that in the converter 25
        water and NaCl is formed which is coupled back to the
        chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis unit. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the invention, the energy stored in
        the battery supply 45 may be provided by a portable battery unit
        rather than, for example, the rectified output of a utility
        power generator in such a circumstance if the reactor engine
        were made small enough and encased for example in metal such as
        a standard propulsion turbine engine, the system of FIG. 4 could
        be mounted for propulsion purposes in an aircraft, ship or in
        land vehicles. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been disclosed in connection
        with a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be understood
        that there may be other variations of the invention which fall
        within the spirit and scope thereof as defined by the appended
        claims. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A solar reactor engine is disclosed which
        includes a concrete or other suitable housing having a reactor
        chamber therein. In one embodiment, the reactor chamber is
        cylindrical. A solar intensifier, such as a parabolic reflector,
        is mounted on top of the reactor housing. The parabolic
        reflector collects and intensifies solar rays and guides them
        down through a solar sight glass, mounted on top of the housing,
        into the reactor chamber. The concentrated beam of light is
        directed onto a reflector cone within the reactor chamber which
        disperses solar rays throughout the chamber. Hydrogen and
        chlorine are conducted into the reactor chamber and react with
        controlled explosive violence when exposed to the solar rays.
        Atmospheric oxygen is used as a control medium to regulate the
        energy given off by the reaction of the hydrogen and chlorine in
        the presence of solar energy. The heat and pressure thus formed
        are utilized to drive a turbine, the output of which is utilized
        to drive a suitable utilization device. In another embodiment of
        the invention, the solar reactor engine is housed in a metal or
        other suitable housing so that the reactor engine can be
        utilized for propulsion or mobile applications. <br>

      <p><b>Background of the Invention</b><br>
        <br>
        This invention is a continuation-in-part of copending
        application Ser. No. 588,888, filed June 20, 1975, which in turn
        is a continuation-in-part of copending application Ser. No.
        564,087, filed Apr. 1, 1975, and titled Solar Reactor Steam
        Generator Method and Apparatus. The subject matter of these
        applications is incorporated herein by reference thereto.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Description</b><br>
        <br>
        This invention relates to reactors and turbines and more
        particularly is related to solar reactors and gas turbines which
        utilize the controlled energy developed by the combination of
        hydrogen and chlorine in the presence of solar energy to convert
        this photo-chemical energy into mechanical and/or electrical
        power. </p>
      <p>In the process of converting energy into mechanical and
        electrical power, many forms of primary movers, i.e. energy
        converters, have been utilized. The most widely used converters
        are gasoline and diesel engines, jet engines and gas turbine
        engines. All of these engines convert fossil fuel into kinetic
        energy which is then converted directly to mechanical power.
        Another example of a common converter commonly used in the art
        is the steam boiler. The steam boiler converts fossil energy
        into kinetic energy which is then converted to mechanical power
        by means of steam turbines. It is a characteristic of all of the
        above-identified energy converters that their efficiency does
        not exceed 40%. Thus, only 40% of the input BTUs in fuel is
        converted to output horsepower. Further, each of the
        aforementioned engines operates with detrimental environmental
        effects; and all are dependent upon fossil fuels or refined
        fossil fuels which require tremendous capital investments for
        recovery, refining and distribution. </p>
      <p>It therefore is an object of this invention to provide a method
        for converting photo-chemical energy to mechanical and/or
        electrical power in sufficient quantity for direct or
        supplemental utility operation. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method of
        utilizing fuels and reactants, which can be produced by
        electrolysis cells and stored wherever electrical power is
        available, whether it be in stored or generated capacity. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of utilizing the explosive energies of reactant gases such as
        hydrogen and chlorine to drive a gas turbine or any engine that
        requires explosive gases for expansion of pistons or rotors. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method of
        evacuating or scrubbing exhaust gases to thereby reduce the heat
        and back pressure of an internal combustion engine resulting in
        higher efficiencies for the engine. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of generating power in the form of a prime mover or electrical
        generator which generates no harmful emissions. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of generating power in the form of a prime mover or electrical
        generator which is more efficient than existing energy
        converters. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide a method of
        generating power in the form of a prime mover or electrical
        generator that does not utilize fossil or nuclear fuels which
        may potentially pollute or otherwise harm the environment about
        the generator. </p>
      <p><b>Short Statement of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly the present invention is related to a solar reactor
        engine which includes a solar reactor chamber having means for
        controllably coupling chlorine and hydrogen thereto. A parabolic
        reflector or other suitable focusing means is positioned with
        respect to the reactor chamber and is controlled by an automated
        azimuth tracker. The parabolic reflector concentrates the solar
        rays into an intense focal point reflector which reflects the
        solar beam via a series of reflectors through a solar sight
        glass and into the reactor chamber. The beam of light passes
        through the reactor chamber and onto the surface of a conical
        reflector at the base of the chamber which disperses the solar
        rays throughout the chamber. The hydrogen and chlorine coupled
        to the reactor chamber exothermicly react to generate hydrogen
        chloride at high temperature and pressure level. Atmospheric
        oxygen is used as a control mechanism to regulate the energy
        given off by the reaction of the hydrogen chloride in the
        presence of solar energy. A turbine is positioned on at least a
        portion of at least one wall of the reactor chamber with the
        pressurized hydrogen chloride driving the turbine. An exhaust
        chamber is positioned on the opposite side of the turbine from
        the reactor chamber wherein the hydrogen chloride is converted
        to hydrochloric acid to thereby form a partial vacuum in the
        exhaust chamber. The partial vacuum has the effect of creating
        an increased pressure differential across the turbine to thereby
        increase the efficiency of operation of the turbine. The
        hydrochloric acid is conveyed away from the exhaust chamber. </p>
      <p>In another aspect of the invention, batteries are provided for
        generating an electrical current which is coupled to a
        chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis cell. The electrical
        current coupled to the electrolysis cell causes the generation
        of chlorine and hydrogen therein which is coupled to the solar
        reactor. At the output of the exhaust chamber of the reactor
        engine the hydrochloric acid is reacted with sodium hydroxide to
        thereby produce water and sodium chloride. The water and sodium
        chloride are coupled back to the chlorine and sodium hydroxide
        electrolysis cell so that the cycle is continuously repeated. </p>

      <p><b>Detailed Description of the Embodiments</b> </p>
      <p>Throughout the detailed description of the embodiments of the
        present invention, like numerals will correspond to like
        elements in the Figures. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 1 where there is disclosed a simplified
        section view of one embodiment of the solar reactor engine of
        the present invention. Fuel and/or reactants are fed into a
        solar reactor chamber 32 via tubes 21 and 22. In the preferred
        embodiment chlorine is fed into the reactor via tube 22 and
        hydrogen via tube 21 at controlled rates. Atmospheric oxygen is
        fed into chamber 32 via tube 23 under the base of a conical
        reflector 24. </p>
      <p>Solar rays are concentrated and intensified by an azimuth
        tracking parabolic reflector system such as is well known in the
        art. Solar radiation is received by a parabolic reflector 35
        which tracks the sun by means of a conventional azimuth tracker
        37. The parabolic reflector concentrates the solar rays into a
        focal point reflector 39 which reflects the intense solar beam
        via reflector 41 through a solar sight glass 27 which may, for
        example, be of the convex or double convex lens type. The
        intensified solar rays are directed downward through solar sight
        glass 27, which is encased within the reactor chamber wall 28,
        and onto the surface of conical reflector 24, which disperses
        the intense solar rays onto the surface of the reactor walls. It
        should also be understood that reflector 24 can have a flat or
        convex shape if desired. Hydrogen and chlorine gas emitted into
        the chamber 32 via tubes 21 and 22, respectively, react with
        controlled explosive violence creating hydrogen chloride gas and
        intense heat and pressure within chamber 32. The explosive
        pressures and heat thus generated are exhausted from chamber 32
        into a vacuum reactor chamber 30 via gas turbine assembly 26.
        The atmospheric oxygen coupled to the chamber via line 20 serves
        as a control medium to regulate the energy given off by the
        reaction of the hydrogen and chloride in the presence of the
        solar energy. The gas turbine assembly may be of any suitable
        type known in the art depending of course on the power levels
        generated. As the hydrogen chloride gas enters the vacuum
        reactor chamber 30, tubes 29 generate water jets which spray
        into the chamber. Five hundred volumes of hydrogen chloride
        combine instantly with one volume of water and form hydrochloric
        acid. The reaction evacuates the chamber instantly, leaving
        hydrochloric acid in the base of the chamber. The hydrochloric
        acid drops via ports 40 into a sodium hydroxide-hydrochloric
        acid reactor 25. The sodium hydroxide is fed into reactor 25 via
        tube 38 from a chlorine-sodium hydroxide cell. The hydrochloric
        acid is mixed with the sodium hydroxide, producing water and
        sodium chloride. The water and sodium chloride are fed from
        reactor 25 to a chlorine-sodium hydroxide cell, via tube 43. The
        water and sodium chloride are converted into fuel and/or
        reactants, hydrogen and chlorine, and sodium hydroxide. The
        process is continuously repeated. </p>
      <p>The heat and pressure from reactor chamber 32 provide explosive
        energies to drive turbine assembly 26, which in turn drives a
        power generator via power take off 42. The evacuation chamber 30
        converts the exhaust gas, hydrogen chloride, into hydrochloric
        acid, creating a vacuum exhaust, increasing the efficiency of
        turbine assembly 26, and eliminates the necessity of atmospheric
        exhaust. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 2 where there is disclosed an alternative
        embodiment of the solar reactor engine of the present invention.
        In this embodiment the housing 28 is formed of a metallic
        material such as in a standard gas turbine engine wherein the
        engine is designed for propulsion or other mobile applications.
        The reactants such as hydrogen and chlorine are supplied by
        means of storage containers or can be generated on a continuous
        basis. In this embodiment rather than utilizing solar energy for
        sustained reaction in the reaction chamber 32, the light is
        generated by, for example, carbon arc ignitors 44 and other high
        intensity light sources. As before, the light generated by the
        high intensity light source 44 is directed into the chamber 32
        and against the conical reflector 24. The light is thus
        dispersed against the walls of the reaction chamber 32 to
        thereby sustain the combination of chlorine and hydrogen to form
        hydrogen chloride. The hydrogen chloride thus formed is at a
        high temperature and pressure level and is thereby forced
        through turbine blades 26 into the exhaust chamber 30. The
        turbine blades 26 are thereby rapidly driven with the mechanical
        energy thus generated coupled to a power take off 42 which may
        drive a mechanical means for moving a vehicle and in addition a
        portion of the mechanical power may be utilized to drive a
        generator 47. In the exhaust chamber 30, water is dispersed
        through tubes 29 to combine with the hydrogen chloride to form
        hydrochloric acid. This acid is conveyed away from the exhaust
        chamber 30 into a container 25. By combining the HCl with water
        a partial vaccum is created in the exhaust chamber 30 which
        assists in driving the turbine 26 because of the increased
        pressure differential thereacross. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 3 which is an alternate embodiment of the
        solar reactor engine of the present invention. As illustrated in
        this embodiment more than one reactor chamber is provided with
        each of the reactor chambers having hydrogen and chlorine
        coupled thereto together with atmospheric oxygen for control
        purposes via select valves 51 which are sequentially operated.
        Each of the reaction chambers 32 has light energy coupled
        thereto from arc ignitors 44 or from concentrated solar energy.
        The combustion gases, hydrogen coupled through line 21 and
        chlorine coupled through line 22, expand through check valves 53
        into an expansion chamber 52. In this arrangement initial
        combustion is sequentially provided by each of the reactor
        chambers 32, the output of which is coupled to the expansion
        chamber 52 thereby increasing the volume in expansion chamber
        52. As in the previous embodiments, the high pressure hydrogen
        chloride thus formed drives the turbine 26, which in turn powers
        a take off unit 42 and a generator 47. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 4 where there is disclosed a block diagram of
        the solar reactor engine of the present invention wherein the
        solar reactor engine is formed as a part of an electrical
        utility power generation and storage system. The generation
        system is fully explained in copending U.S. patent application
        Ser. No. 564,087, filed Apr. 1, 1975 by the same inventors
        herewith. The subject matter of that application is incorporated
        herewith by reference. As illustrated in FIG. 4, surplus
        electrical power generated during off peak demand periods is
        coupled to the chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis cell 14 to
        therey generate chlorine and hydrogen which is stored, then
        coupled to the reactor chamber 32 via lines 21 and 22 during
        peak demand periods. As aforementioned, the output of the
        reactor chamber drives a turbine which in turn drives a power
        take off unit 42. The power take off unit 42 powers a generator
        47 which generates electrical power during peak load demand
        periods so that in effect the electrical energy generated during
        off peak demand periods is recovered and utilized to provide
        peak load demands during periods of high power use in the
        utility system. In addition, the power take off unit 42 drives
        an atmospheric compressor unit 49 which supplies atmospheric
        oxygen to the reactor 32 via line 23 to thereby control the
        reaction of the hydrogen and chlorine within the reactor in a
        known manner. As illustrated water is coupled to the exhaust
        chamber 30 via line 29 with the output of the exhaust chamber
        being coupled to the hydrochloric acid converter unit 25.
        Coupled to the hydrochloric acid converter unit is sodium
        hydroxide from the electrolysis cell 14 via line 30a so that in
        the converter 25 water and NaCl is formed which is coupled back
        to the chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis unit. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the invention, the energy stored in
        the battery supply 45 may be provided by a portable battery unit
        rather than, for example, the rectified output of a utility
        power generator. In such a circumstance, if the reactor engine
        was made small enough and encased for example in metal such as a
        standard propulsion turbine engine, the system of FIG. 4 could
        be mounted for propulsion purposes in an aircraft, ship or in
        land vehicles. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 5 where there is disclosed a block diagram of
        an alternate embodiment of the solar reactor engine of the
        present invention. As illustrated in this embodiment, the
        atmospheric compressor 49 is an integral component of a gas
        turbine engine. The compressor 49 compresses a large volume of
        air which is heated in the compression process. The heated air
        (atmospheric oxygen) is injected into the solar reactor chamber
        where it is further heated and expanded by the exothermic
        reaction between the hydrogen and chlorine when exposed to
        intense light. The expanded air along with the hydrogen
        chloride, which is generated with explosive pressures and heats,
        is exhausted from chamber 32 into a vacuum reactor scrubber 30
        via gas turbine assembly 26. The gas turbine assembly may be of
        any suitable type known in the art. As the hydrogen chloride gas
        enters the vacuum reactor scrubber 30, tubes 29 convey water to
        water jets (not shown) which spray water into the chamber. The
        hydrogen chloride combines instantly with the water and forms
        hydrochloric acid. The atmospheric gases are partially cooled by
        the water. The reaction partially evacuates the chamber, leaving
        hydrochloric acid in the base of the chamber and passing cooled
        atmospheric gases into the atmosphere via flue exhaust chamber
        53. The hydrochloric acid drops via ports into a sodium
        hydroxide-hydrochloric acid reactor 25. The sodium hydroxide is
        fed into reactor 25 via tube 38 from a chlorine-sodium hydroxide
        cell. The hydrochloric acid is mixed with the sodium hydroxide,
        producing water and sodium chloride. The water and sodium
        chloride are fed from reactor 25 to a chlorine-sodium hydroxide
        cell, via tube 43. The water and sodium chloride are converted
        into fuel and/or reactants, hydrogen and chlorine, and sodium
        hydroxide. The process is continuously repeated. </p>
      <p>The heated air and pressure from compressor 49 and reactor
        chamber 32 provide explosive energies to drive turbine assembly
        26, which in turn drives a power generator via power take off
        42. The evacuation scrubber chamber 30 cools the exhaust air
        (atmospheric gases) and converts the hydrogen chloride into
        hydrochloric acid, creating a partial vacuum exhaust and
        increasing the efficiency of turbine assembly 26. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been disclosed in connection
        with a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be understood
        that there may be other variations of the invention which fall
        within the spirit and scope thereof as defined by the appended
        claims. </p>

      <b>Abstract --- </b>A solar reactor combustion chamber is
      disclosed which includes a concrete or other suitable housing
      having a reactor chamber and a combustion chamber therein. A solar
      intensifier, such as a parabolic reflector, is mounted on top of
      the reactor housing. The parabolic reflector collects and
      intensifies solar rays and guides them through a solar sight
      glass, mounted on top of the housing, into the reactor chamber.
      The concentrated beam of light is directed onto a light disperser
      within the reactor chamber which disperses solar rays throughout
      the chamber. Molecular hydrogen and chlorine is conducted into the
      reactor chamber wherein in the presence of light the chlorine
      molecules expand into atomic chlorine. The chlorine and hydrogen
      molecules are forced into the combustion chamber together with
      oxygen wherein the chlorine and hydrogen react with controlled
      explosive violence to form HCl. The heat and pressure thus formed
      are utilized to heat or drive suitable utilization devices, such
      as turbines or pistons. <br>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to reactors and combustion chambers and,
        more particularly, is related to solar reactors and combustion
        chambers which utilize molecular hydrogen and chlorine gases in
        the presence of solar or artificial light energy to produce
        atomic hydrogen and chlorine which are exothermically combined
        in the presence of atmospheric oxygen to produce heat energy
        which is converted into chemical or mechanical energy for
        propulsion and/or for the generation of electrical power. </p>
      <p>In the process of converting fossil fuels into mechanical or
        chemical energy for the purpose of generating mechanical or
        electrical power, two types of combustion processes are known,
        i.e., external and internal combustion. External combustion is
        generally accomplished by burning a fuel in an open combustion
        chamber resulting in a flame which is typically supported by
        atmospheric oxygen. Internal combustion is typically
        accomplished by introducing a fuel and a fixed amount of oxygen
        or other suitable oxidizing agent within an enclosed combustion
        chamber. The fuel and oxidizing agent are ignited which results
        in a rapid burning or explosion within the chamber. Both the
        internal and external combustion properties are generally
        sustained by an open flame or an electrical arc. Both the
        internal and external combustion processes result in a typically
        low efficiency conversion of energy. Further, both methods
        produce harmful exhaust emissions and pollutants and all methods
        of converting fossil fuels into energy are dependent upon a
        limited and increasingly expensive supply of such fuels. </p>
      <p>It, therefore, is an object of this invention to provide a
        method and apparatus for generating energy by means of a
        non-fossil fuel. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide an
        energy-generation system wherein products of combustion formed
        therein can be totally cleansed of emissions and pollutants
        which are harmful to the atmosphere and the environment. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a reactor
        combustion chamber wherein an exothermic reaction is supported
        by solar and/or artificial light. </p>
      <p>It is still another object of this invention to provide an
        energy-generation system wherein the products of combustion are
        recycled to continuously support an exothermic reaction therein.
      </p>
      <p><b>Short Statement of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, the present invention relates to a solar reactor
        combustion system which includes a solar reactor chamber having
        means for controllably coupling molecular chlorine and hydrogen
        thereto and a combustion chamber having means for controllably
        coupling atomic chlorine, hydrogen, and atmospheric oxygen
        thereto. A parabolic reflector, or other suitable focusing
        means, is positioned with respect to the reactor chamber and is
        controlled to follow the sun by means of an automated azimuth
        tracker. The parabolic reflector concentrates solar rays onto a
        focal point reflector which reflects the solar beam via a series
        of reflectors through a solar sight glass and into the reactor
        chamber. The beam of light passes through the reactor chamber
        and onto the surface of a light dispersal means such as a
        conical reflector valve at the base of the reactor chamber.
        Thus, the solar rays are dispersed throughout the reactor
        chamber. The chlorine gas molecules, coupled to the reactor
        chamber, are split into ionized chlorine atoms by the solar
        rays. The resulting hydrogen and chlorine cause an increase in
        the pressure of the reactor chamber, thereby forcing the
        chlorine atoms and hydrogen into the combustion chamber. In the
        combustion chamber, the chlorine and hydrogen react in the
        presence of atmospheric oxygen with controlled explosive
        violence. The hot gases formed from the explosion can be
        utilized to provide mechanical and/or electrical power. As an
        example, the hot gases can be utilized to heat a boiler,
        compress a piston, or drive a turbine. </p>

      <p><b>Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments</b> </p>
      <p>Throughout the detailed description of the embodiments of the
        present invention, like numerals will correspond to like
        elements in the figures. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 1 where there is disclosed a simplified
        section view of one embodiment of the solar reactor combustion
        chamber of the present invention. The solar reactor combustion
        chamber includes a housing 11 which may, for example, be formed
        of reinforced concrete or other materials capable of
        withstanding very high pressure levels. The housing is divided
        into a reaction chamber 13 and a combustion chamber 15, by means
        of a wall 17. Fuel or reactants are fed into the reactor chamber
        13, via tubes 19 and 21, respectively. In the preferred
        embodiment, chlorine is fed into the reactor via tube 19 and
        hydrogen is fed into the reactor chamber via tube 21 at
        controlled rates. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment of the invention, solar rays are concentrated
        and intensified by an azimuth tracking parabolic reflector
        system of the type well known in the art. Solar radiation is
        directed by parabolic reflector 23 which tracks the sun by means
        of the azimuth tracker 25. The parabolic&nbsp; reflector
        concentrates the solar rays onto a focal point reflector 27
        which reflects the intense solar beam via reflector 29 through a
        solar sight glass 31. The intensified solar rays are directed
        downwardly through the solar sight glass 31 which is encased
        within the walls of the housing 11 and onto the surface of a
        conical reflector valve 33, which disperses the intense solar
        rays onto the surface of the reactor walls. It should be
        understood that the reflector 33 can have a flat or convex
        shape, if desired. Of primary importance, however, is the fact
        that the solar rays must be dispersed throughout the reaction
        chamber 13 in order to provide for the most efficient operation
        of the method and apparatus of the present invention. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, molecular chlorine and hydrogen gas is
        emitted into the chamber 13 via tubes 19 and 21, respectively.
        When the chlorine becomes exposed to the solar radiation within
        the chamber, the chlorine expands to form ionic atomic chlorine
        within the chamber. The chlorine and hydrogen are at least
        partially combined in chamber 13 to form HCl and a large amount
        of heat energy. Accordingly, the pressure level within the
        chamber 13 is substantially increased. The hydrogen, chlorine
        and HCl are forced through valve port 35 defined by the conical
        reflector 13 and the wall 17. The gas is passed into the
        combustion chamber 15. Also, coupled to the combustion chamber
        15 is atmospheric oxygen via a plurality of openings 37. The
        hydrogen and chlorine combine in the presence of the atmospheric
        oxygen, with controlled explosive violence, to thereby create
        hydrogen chloride gas and intense heat and pressure within the
        chamber 15. The explosive pressures and heat thus generated are
        utilized to perform work by generating steam, driving a turbine
        and/or driving a piston, as will become more fully apparent
        hereinbelow. The high pressure gases generated within the
        chamber 15 are conducted from the chamber 15 by means of ports
        39, or may be conducted from the chamber in a particular manner,
        as set out more fully in connection with discussion of FIGS. 4
        and 5. </p>
      <p>As will become apparent from FIG. 1, the conical reflector 33
        is fixedly secured to a reciprocating support member 41 and is
        spring-biased to close the port 35. However, when the pressure
        within chamber 13 increases, at a predetermined level, the port
        35 is opened by forcing the concical reflector 33 downwardly.
        Subsequently, upon the occurrence of a controlled explosion in
        the combustion chamber 15, the conical reflector is driven
        upwardly to close the port 35. This pulsating expansion and
        combustion process occurs repeatedly as the chlorine and
        hydrogen molecules are split into atomic hydrogen and chlorine
        and, subsequently, are combined to form HCl in the combustion
        chamber 15. </p>
      <p>As an alternative, the conical reflector 33 can be fixedly
        positioned to provide a continuously open port 35 or it can be
        controlled by a cam to open the port 35 at preselected time
        intervals. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 2 where there is disclosed an alternative
        embodiment of the solar reactor combustion chamber of the
        present invention. In this embodiment, the housing 11 is formed
        of a metallic material such as in a standard internal combustion
        engine wherein the engine is designed for propelling a vehicle
        or for other similar applications. In order to minimize
        corrosion, the internal walls of the housing may be formed of an
        impervious carbonaceous material such as "KT" Silicon Carbide
        which has excellent thermal shock characteristics. In this
        embodiment, rather than utilizing solar energy for splitting the
        molecular chlorine into atomic chlorine, as in the embodiment of
        FIG. 1, light is generated by, for example, a photographic
        projection lamp 44, or other suitable high-intensity light
        source. The light source is housed in a chamber 45, preferably
        having reflector walls therein so that substantially all the
        light generated by the source 44 is eventually directed
        downwardly through the solar sight glass 31 into the reaction
        chamber 13. The structure of the solar reactor combustion
        chamber is otherwise similar to that of FIG. 1 and is for the
        purpose of providing a means for efficiently and economically
        generating energy. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 3 where there is disclosed an embodiment of
        the solar reactor combustion chamber utilized for the purpose of
        generating steam. The solar reactor combustion chamber is
        similar to that illustrated in FIG. 1. However, carbonaceous
        blocks 51 are positioned along at least two internal walls of
        the combustion chamber 15. The carbonaceous blocks, preferably
        consisting of "KT" Silicon Carbide, manufactured by the
        Carborundum Corporation, have relatively large side surface
        areas 53 and a relatively small or narrow depth dimension, with
        each of the blocks being fixedly positioned against the side
        walls of the housing 11 of the combustion chamber 15. A
        carbonaceous block may be formed of any suitable low
        permeability impervious graphite or carbon material but, as
        aforementioned, in a preferred embodiment is formed of "KT"
        Silicon Carbide. Such a block can operate at working
        temperatures of up to 3,000.degree. F. in an oxidizing
        atmosphere and has a thermal conductivity in excess of 700 BTU 1
        hr./sq.ft./.degree. F./in. In addition, "KT" Silicon Carbide is
        impermeable, has excellent thermal shock characteristics, and
        can contain liquid or gas at pressures in excess of 2000 psig. </p>
      <p>As illustrated, channel 30 is formed in each of the blocks 51,
        with the channel 30 having a grid structure so that the fluid or
        gas passing through the channel is exposed to a maximum of the
        heat energy absorbed by the carbanaceous block. </p>
      <p>In operation, a liquid or vapor such as water or steam is fed
        into the channel 30 at the input 55 thereto. The fluid passes
        upwardly through the blocks 51 and out of the ports 57. In the
        meantime, heat from the combustion chamber 15 is transferred to
        the carbanaceous blocks 51 by conduction, convection and
        radiation. The energy is efficiently absorbed by the
        carbanaceous block and is converted into heat energy. This heat
        energy is, in turn, transferred to the fluid passing through the
        channels 30. As the fluid heats up, it begins to expand, rise in
        temperature, and increase in velocity. As the fluid travels
        upward in the channels 30, the fluid absorbs more of the latent
        heat absorbed by the carbonaceous block and continues its
        expansion until it reaches a desired heat and pressure level and
        is exhausted through the outlet ports 57. The resulting high
        temperature fluid can be utilized to drive turbines or power
        other suitable mechanisms. In the meantime, the exhaust gases
        from the combustion chamber 13 are exhausted via outlet port 39.
      </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 4 where there is disclosed an alternate
        embodiment of the solar reactor combustion chamber of the
        present invention utilized to drive a turbine. In this
        embodiment, at least one reactor-combustion housing 11 is
        fixedly secured to a turbine 61 which includes a plenum chamber
        63, a turbine rotor 65, mounted on a shaft 67, and a turbine
        housing 69 which defines therein a torus ring assembly 71, which
        guides the hot exhaust gases from the combustion chamber 15 into
        the turbine blades 65 of turbine 61. Thus, in operation
        atmospheric oxygen enters plenum chamber 65 via an annular port
        73. The oxygen passes into the combustion chamber 15 of the
        reactor combustion system 11 to thereby control the formation of
        hydrogen chloride therein. The hot expanding exhaust products
        are forced outwardly through the bottom of chamber 15 into the
        torus ring 71 defined by the turbine housing 69. The hot gases
        are then forced radially inwardly toward the turbine rotor 65 to
        cause the turbine rotor to rapidly rotate in response thereto.
        The exhuast gases are then forced from the turbine out through
        port 75 into a scrubber chamber 30. The scrubber chamber
        receives water into which the HCl dissolves to form hydrochloric
        acid which falls to the bottom of the scrubber chamber and into
        container 24. The remaining gases are exhausted to the
        atmosphere. Sodium hydroxide is coupled to the container 24 via
        line 38 to thereby convert the sodium hydroxide to water and
        sodium chloride. The water and sodium chloride are fed to the
        chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis cell 50. The output of
        the electrolysis cell in the form of chlorine and hydrogen is
        supplied to chamber 13 via lines 19 and 21, respectively. Thus,
        the sodium and chlorine are continuously recycled to thereby
        substantially reduce the cost of fuel over that required in
        conventional fossil fuel powered turbine generators.
        Furthermore, the emission products exhausted to atmosphere are
        primarily water and the elements found in the atmosphere.
        Accordingly, a clean burning, efficient turbine engine is
        provided which is relatively inexpensive to operate. While in
        the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, only one reaction
        combustion chamber is illustrated, it should be understood that
        a plurality of such reaction combustion chambers can be
        positioned about the outside periphery of the turbine housing 69
        to provide a more uniform distribution of the high velocity
        exhaust gases generated in the reaction chamber 15. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 5 where there is disclosed in schematic form
        an alternative embodiment of the solar reactor engine of the
        present invention. In this embodiment the housing 11 is formed
        of a metallic material such as in a standard gas turbine engine
        wherein the engine is designed for propulsion or other mobile
        applications. In order to reduce corrosion the inner walls of
        the reactor may be lined with an impervious carbonaceous
        material. The reactants, hydrogen and chlorine, are supplied to
        the reactor housing 11 by means of lines 21 and 19,
        respectively. The hydrogen and chlorine can be provided by means
        of storage containers (not shown) or can be generated on a
        continuous basis. Oxygen, preferably in atmospheric form, is
        supplied to chamber 15 by means of line 38 for the purpose of
        controlling the reaction of the hydrogen with the chlorine. In
        this embodiment rather than utilizing solar energy for
        sustaining reaction in the reaction chamber 13, the light is
        generated by a high intensity light source 44. As before, the
        light generated by the high intensity light source 44 is
        directed into the chamber 13 and against the conical reflector
        33. The light is thus dispersed against the walls of the
        reaction chamber 13 to thereby generate atomic chlorine. The
        chlorine and hydrogen are combined in chamber 15 to form
        hydrogen chloride. The hydrogen chloride thus formed is at a
        high temperature and pressure level and is thereby forced
        through the turbine blades of turbine 61 into the exhaust
        chamber 30. The turbine blades of turbine 61 are thereby rapidly
        driven with the mechanical energy thus generated coupled to a
        power take-off 42 which may drive a mechanical means for moving
        a vehicle and in addition a portion of the mechanical power may
        be utilized to drive a generator 48. The output of the generator
        48 is utilized to recharge battery 50 which in turn provides DC
        current for energizing electrolysis cell 14. In the exhaust
        chamber 30, water is dispersed through tubes 28 to combine with
        the hydrogen chloride to form hydrochloric acid. This acid is
        conveyed away from the exhaust chamber 30 into a container 24.
        By combining the HCl with water a partial vacuum is created in
        the exhaust chamber 30 which assists in driving the turbine
        because of the increased pressure differential thereacross. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment sodium hydroxide from a
        chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis cell 14 is supplied to
        the container 24 via line 38. The hydrochloric acid is mixed
        with the sodium hydroxide to produce water and sodium chloride.
        The water and sodium chloride are fed from the container 24 to
        the chlorine-sodium hydroxide cell via line 46. The water and
        sodium chloride are converted into fuel and/or reactants,
        hydrogen and chlorine and sodium hydroxide. This process is
        continuously repeated. The output from the alternator 48 is
        utilized to sustain electrolysis in the chlorine-sodium
        hydroxide electrolysis cell. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 6 where there is disclosed an alternate
        embodiment of the solar reactor combustion chamber of the
        present invention utilized to drive a piston in a piston engine.
        In this embodiment, the housing 11 of the reactor combustion
        chamber is fixedly secured to the engine housing 81 with the
        exhaust port 39 from the combustion chamber 15 leading into a
        chamber 83 defined by the engine block 85, piston 87 and header
        block 88. Atmospheric oxygen is conducted into the chamber 83
        via manifold 89 and intake valve 91. This oxygen mixes with the
        atomic chlorine and hydrogen, passing downwardly into the
        chamber 15 and into the chamber 83 to create a substantial
        expansion thereof via a controlled explosive reaction. The
        resulting combustion products are exhausted from the chamber 83
        via exhaust valve 93 and exhaust manifold 95. Each time oxygen
        is permitted into the chamber 83, an explosion occurs which
        drives the piston 87 downwardly. Upon the return upward stroke,
        a conical reflector valve 33 is driven upwardly to close the
        port 35. At the same time, exhaust valve 93 is lowered, causing
        the exhaust products to pass out to exhaust manifold 95.
        Subsequently, the piston 87 is again moved downwardly,
        permitting the conical reflector valve 33 to open up to permit
        atomic chlorine and hydrogen to pass downwardly into the
        combustion chamber 15 and the chamber 83. At the same time,
        oxygen is coupled to the chamber 83 via intake valve 91 to
        control the exothermic combination of the hydrogen and chlorine.
        The piston is then driven downwardly to complete the cycle. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 7 which is a simplified schematic
        illustration of a single cycle internal combustion engine. In
        this embodiment a piston 80 defines a combustion chamber 13 into
        which a measured amount of chlorine and hydrogen and atmospheric
        oxygen is supplied via lines 19, 21 and 37, respectively. The
        resulting controlled explosion drives the piston 80 downwardly
        until the top surface 82 of the piston passes the exhaust port
        84 of the cylinder defined by the housing 11. The reaction gas,
        hydrogen chloride, as well as air egress through the port into a
        scrubber chamber (not shown) of similar degree to that
        illustrated in FIG. 6. The piston is then returned to a top
        dead-center position. Before the piston reaches the top
        dead-center position, the chlorine and hydrogen are supplied to
        the chamber 13. When the piston reaches top dead-center, the
        light source 44 is energized synchronously with movement of the
        piston 80 to cause the hydrogen and chlorine to combine
        exothermically to thereby force the piston 80 downwardly. </p>
      <p>It should be understood the solar reactor of the present
        invention can be used to drive a rotary engine such as a Wankel
        engine as well as two and four cycle piston engines. The
        embodiments of FIGS. 6 and 7 merely illustrate the application
        of the solar reactor engine to piston engines for efficiently
        and economically driving these engines. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been disclosed in connection
        with a preferred embodiment thereof, it should be understood
        that there may be other variations of the invention which fall
        within the spirit and scope thereof, as defined by the appended
        claims. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to reactors and turbine engine systems
        and more particularly relates to electromagnetic reactors and
        gas turbine engine systems which utilize the controlled energies
        developed by the combination of hydrogen and chlorine when
        exposed to electromagnetic energy. The methods of electrolyzing
        hydrogen and chlorine from sea water or brine, or from
        hydrochloric acid using less energy, and the methods and sources
        of obtaining the reactant gases, hydrogen and chlorine, without
        electrolysis are well known in the art. </p>
      <p>In the process of converting energy into mechanical and
        electrical power, many forms of energy converters have been
        utilized. The most widely used converters are gasoline and
        diesel engines, jet engines and gas turbine engines. All of
        these engines convert fossil fuel into kinetic energy which is
        then converted directly to mechanical power. Another example of
        a converter commonly used in the art is the steam boiler. The
        steam boiler converts fossil energy into kinetic energy which is
        then converted to mechanical power by means of a steam turbine.
        It is a characteristic of all of the above-identified energy
        converters that their efficiency does not exceed 40%. Thus, only
        40% of the input BTUs in fuel is converted to output horsepower.
        Further, each of the aforementioned engines operates with
        detrimental environmental effects; and all are dependent upon
        fossil fuels or refined fossil fuels which require tremendous
        capital investments for recovery, refining and distribution and
        none of these fuels are recyclable. Therefore, the total energy
        of the fuel plus the recovery and refining energy are totally
        consumed in one reaction. </p>
      <p>It therefore is an object of this invention to provide a method
        for producing electromagnetic-chemical energy that is
        convertible to mechanical and/or electrical power. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method of
        utilizing recyclable fuels and reactants, which can be produced
        by electrolysis cells and stored. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of utilizing reactant gases such as hydrogen chloride or
        hydrogen and chlorine which can be derived from natural sources.
      </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method of
        converting exhaust gases back to fuel and reactants thereby
        resulting in higher efficiencies for the engine. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of fueling a gas turbine engine system which generates no
        harmful emissions. </p>
      <p>It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method
        of fueling a gas turbine engine system which is more efficient
        than existing energy converters. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide a method of
        fueling a gas turbine engine system that does not utilize fossil
        or nuclear fuels which may potentially pollute or otherwise harm
        the environment about the generator. </p>
      <p><b>Short Statement of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, the present invention is an electromagnetic
        reactor engine system including an electromagnetic reactor
        having means for controllably coupling quantities of chlorine
        and hydrogen thereto. The gases are initially derived either
        from the electrolysis of sea water or brine or from natural
        sources. The hydrogen and chlorine in the reactor react
        exothermically when exposed to electromagnetic radiation to
        generate hydrogen chloride at a high temperature and pressure. A
        turbine is positioned on at least a portion of at least one wall
        of the reactor so that the pressurized hydrogen chloride drives
        a turbine. A gas-water reactor scrubber is positioned on the
        opposite side of the turbine from the reactor wherein the
        hydrogen chloride is converted to hydrochloric acid then dropped
        into a receiver tank below the scrubber. The hydrochloric acid
        is fed to an electrolyzer which converts the hydrochloric acid
        to hydrogen and chlorine, thereby increasing the efficiency of
        the system since less energy is needed for the electrolysis of
        hydrochloric acid than sea water or brine. </p>
      <p>In another aspect of the invention, batteries provide an
        electrical current to power the hydrochloric acid electrolysis
        cell. Alternatively, solar energy powers the cell. </p>
      <p>In another aspect of the invention, bottled hydrogen and
        chlorine are connected directly to the solar reactor. The
        hydrochloric acid produced in the gas-water reactor may be
        either fed back to the hydrochloric acid electrolysis cell so
        that the cycle is continuously repeated, or stored and fed to
        the electrolyzer at a later time. </p>
      <p>In another aspect of the invention, hydrogen chloride or
        hydrogen and chlorine from volcanic sources are connected
        directly to the reactor. The hydrochloric acid formed in the
        gas-water reactor is recycled through the electrolyzer and the
        resulting gases, hydrogen and chlorine, are either stored, used
        as supplementary reactants, or removed as by-products of the
        system. </p>

      <p><b>Detailed Description</b> </p>
      <p>Throughout the detailed description of the embodiments of the
        present invention, like numerals will correspond to like
        elements in the figures. </p>
      <p>The primary generation system for this invention is fully
        explained in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,998,205, 4,024,715 and 4,026,112,
        held by the inventors of this invention. The subject matter of
        these patents is incorporated herewith by reference thereto. As
        illustrated in FIG. 1, the first embodiment of the invention
        includes a chlorine-sodium hydroxide electrolysis 14 cell which
        is powered by battery 45. The cell 14 produces hydrogen and
        chlorine as the initial supply of reactants, which are conveyed
        to the reactor 32 via lines 21 and 22 respectively. The reactor
        32 is powered by solar or artificial light source 50 which
        contains electromagnetic energy from infrared, through the
        visible, to the near and middle ultraviolet frequencies as
        provided by the sun. Higher frequencies may be utilized, such as
        upper ultraviolet, gamma, and x-ray radiation. If solar energy
        is being used, copending application Ser. No. 692,495 discloses
        a method of collecting and intensifying such light. The hydrogen
        and chlorine exothermically react when energized by the
        electromagnetic radiation in the presence of atmospheric oxygen,
        supplied to the reactor 32 by compressor 49 and line 23. The
        reactor produces hydrogen chloride at a high temperature and
        pressure which is used to turn the rotor of turbine 26, which in
        turn powers compressor 49, power take off 42, and alternator 47
        which charges battery 45. The spent gases are exhausted from the
        turbine 26 into the gas-water reactor scrubber 30 where they are
        scrubbed by water from water supply 34. The hydrogen chloride
        gas combines with water to form hydrochloric acid which drops
        into tank 25. The remaining gases escape through exhaust 53 into
        the atmosphere. The hydrochloric acid from tank 25 is fed to
        hydrochloric acid electrolysis cell 38 via line 43. The
        chlorine-sodium hydroxide cell 14 may then be shut down since
        hydrogen and chlorine may be conveyed to reactor 32 through
        lines 19 and 20 from the hydrochloric acid electrolysis cell 38.
        Cell 38 requires less than half the energy required by the
        chlorine-sodium hydroxide cell 14, thereby leaving more energy
        for other work. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of the second embodiment of the
        invention. The initial quantity of reactants for reactor 32 are
        produced in hydrochloric acid electrolysis cell 38 from
        hydrochloric acid in supply 48. The remainder of the system is
        identical to that of the first embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1.
        The second embodiment requires less than half the energy for
        start-up than the first embodiment since the hydrochloric acid
        cell 38 requires less energy than the chlorine-sodium hydroxide
        cell 14 of FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>The third embodiment of the present invention is illustrated in
        FIG. 3. Again, this invention differs from the previous
        embodiments only in the method of providing the initial quantity
        of reactants for reactor 32. In this embodiment, the initial
        reactants are supplied from containers 51 and 52 containing
        hydrogen and chlorine respectively. The reactants are conveyed
        from containers 51 and 52 through lines 27 and 28 to the reactor
        32. After the initial start-up period, hydrochloric acid
        electrolysis cell 38 is used to both supply reactor 32 with
        reactants and to recharge containers 51 and 52. This embodiment
        requires no start-up energy as required by chlorine-sodium
        hydroxide cell 14 in FIG. 1 or the hydrochloric acid cell 38 in
        FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>The fourth embodiment as illustrated in FIG. 4 shows yet
        another method of providing the initial supply of reactants to
        reactor 32. In this embodiment, hydrogen chloride from a
        volcanic source 55 is conveyed directly to reactor 32 via line
        29. This embodiment requires the use of a two-stage reactor as
        is disclosed in copending application Ser. No. 692,495 by the
        inventors of the present invention. The hydrogen chloride from
        source 55 is introduced into the oxygen-free combustion chamber
        32a. There, the energy from electromagnetic source 50 is used to
        ionize the hydrogen chloride. The energy imparted by
        electromagnetic source 50 heats and expands the ionized gas and
        forces the gas through valve port 32c into combustion chamber
        32b. In chamber 32b, in the presence of oxygen supplied by line
        23, the ionized gases recombine to form hydrogen chloride in an
        exothermic reaction. The source of volcanic hydrogen chloride 55
        may either be a volcano directly or a container of gases from a
        volcano. This embodiment requires no external start-up energy as
        required by the previous embodiments. The hydrochloric acid
        produced in the gas-water reactor scrubber 30 may either be
        conveyed back to hydrochloric acid electrolysis cell 38 via line

        system as a by-product. </p>
      <p>The fifth embodiment of this invention as illustrated in FIG. 5
        demonstrates that the electrolysis cells in any of the previous
        embodiments may be alternatively powered by solar source 57. The
        use of solar energy to power electrolysis cells is well known in

      generation system includes a nuclear reactor having a core which
      in addition to generating heat generates a high frequency
      electromagnetic radiation. An electromagnetic radiation chamber is
      positioned to receive at least a portion of the radiation
      generated by the reactor core. Hydrogen and chlorine are connected
      into the electromagnetic reactor chamber and react with controlled
      explosive violence when exposed to the radiation from the nuclear
      reactor. Oxygen is fed into the reactor chamber as a control
      medium. The resulting gases under high pressure and temperature
      are utilized to drive a gas turbine generators. In an alternative
      embodiment the highly ionized gases, hydogen and chlorine are
      utilized as a fluid medium for use in magnetohydrodynamic
      generators which are attached to the electromagnetic reactor
      chambers.

    <blockquote>This invention relates to a system for converting
      electromagnetic energy to mechanical energy.</blockquote>
    <blockquote>As disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. patents, it is
      known to convey controlled amounts of hydrogen and chlorine to a
      chamber which is exposed to high frequency electromagnetic
      radiation such as derived from the sun or from an artificial light
      source. The chlorine molecules are broken up into atomic chlorine
      with some chlorine being ionized. The atomized chlorine combines
      with hydrogen atoms to form hydrogen chloride. The hydrogen
      chloride is formed in an exothermic reaction which results in the
      temperature of the hydrogen chloride being substantially higher
      than that of the chlorine or hydrogen molecules conveyed to the
      reactor chamber. The resulting high temperature, high pressure gas
      is utilized to drive an output device such as a turbine.
      <p>Such a system requires a substantial amount of high energy
        electromagnetic radiation. This is not available from the sun
        unless a concentrator is utilized. Further, even with a
        concentrator, the sunlight is not continuously available and the
        level of sunlight changes with the seasons and with the weather.
      </p>
      <p>Thus there is a need in the art to provide an improved source
        of high energy electromagnetic radiation. </p>
      <p>It is also known in the art to provide a nuclear reactor for
        converting nuclear into mechanical or electrical energy. A
        number of different types of reactors are available, however,
        all reactors generate high frequency radiation including gamma
        rays. This radiation which is harmful to humans is dissipated
        through a shield. This energy is thus lost during the nuclear
        power generation process. </p>
      <p>There, accordingly, is a need in the art to provide an improved
        means for utilizing the high energy radiation generated in
        nuclear reactors. </p>
      <p><b>Short Statement of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, this invention relates to an energy conversion
        system which includes an electromagnetic reactor chamber having
        inputs for controllably coupling chlorine and hydrogen thereto.
        The chamber is positioned with respect to a nuclear reactor such
        that high energy radiation from the reactor is conveyed from the
        nuclear reactor to the electromagnetic reactor chamber. The
        radiation from the nuclear reactor is, therefore, utilized to
        convert the hydrogen and chlorine to hydrogen chloride and other
        highly charged particles at high temperature and pressure
        levels. Thus a continuous source of high energy radiation is
        provided while at the same time a means is provided for
        eliminating the danger of harmful radiation leaking from the
        nuclear reactor. </p>

      <p><b>Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment</b> </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 1 which is a simplified schematic
        illustration of the preferred embodiment of the present
        invention. An electromagnetic reactor chamber 11 of the type
        illustrated and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,070,861;
        4,026,112; 4,024,715 and 3,998,205 each of which are assigned to
        the common assignee herewith, is shown having its output
        connected to a turbine 13. As will be explained more fully
        hereinbelow the reactor generates high temperature, high
        pressure hydrogen chloride and highly ionized hydrogen and
        chlorine. These gases are coupled to a turbine 13 which is
        designed to withstand the highly corrosive hydrogen chloride and
        which converts the high energy molecules and particles from
        reactor 11 to mechanical energy. The output of the turbine
        drives a suitable power output device such as an electrical
        generator 14. The gases from the turbine which include hydrogen
        chloride are coupled to an electroylsis cell 15 which through a
        process of electrolysis commonly known in the art generates
        molecular hydrogen and chlorine. The molecular hydrogen and
        chlorine are controllably coupled back to the reactor 11 to form
        the reactants therein. </p>
      <p>As an important part of the present invention, a nuclear
        reactor 17 of conventional design has a nuclear reactor core
        therein, together with nuclear fuel rods, moderator rods and
        control rod piles, each of which are contained in a pressure
        vessel. The pressure vessel has at least one sight glass in the
        vessel wall in close proximity to the reactor 11. The nuclear
        reactor produces thermal and radiant energy as nuclear
        transition and degradation occurs within the reactor 17. Gamma
        rays from the reactor are directed into the reactor chamber 11
        and absorbed by the chlorine and hydrogen molecules in the
        presence of oxygen. The resulting highly energized gases
        generate light, heat and pressure in the reactor 11. The high
        pressure gases in turn drive the turbine 13. The gases and gamma
        radiation are quantitatively controlled to bring about the
        desired reaction between the reactants for the purpose of
        obtaining the desired energy levels for the turbine 13. </p>
      <p>The thermal energy from the nuclear reactor 17 may be utilized
        to drive the same power output device as driven by the reactor
        11 or may be used for any other suitable purpose. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 2 which is a simplified section view of the
        referred embodiment of the present invention. </p>
      <p>As illustrated in FIG. 2, a nuclear reactor power system is
        illustrated in simplified plan view and includes a reactor
        housing 21 which is formed of reinforced concrete or other
        materials capable of retaining high frequency radiation. The
        housing 21 contains a nuclear reactor core which is positioned
        within a pressure vessel 23. The pressure vessel has, in the
        preferred embodiment, a plurality of sight glasses 25-28 which
        are supported and fixed in the pressure vessel at appropriate
        intervals about the wall. The sight glasses must be strong
        enough to support the pressure generated by the nuclear reactor
        core while at the same time be transparent to the high frequency
        electromagnetic radiation generated therein. </p>
      <p>A plurality of electromagnetic reactor chambers 11 are each
        positioned proximate a sight glass for receiving the high
        frequency electromagnetic radiation generated in the core. The
        electromagnetic reactor chambers, as aforementioned, are of the
        type disclosed in the aforementioned U.S. patents, the subject
        matter of which is incorporated herein by reference thereto. The
        reactor chambers are each secured to a corresponding sight glass
        by suitable mechanical means to render the chambers pressure
        tight at the junction of the sight glass and the reactor.
        Secured to the other end of the reactors are turbines 29-32.
        Preferably the turbines 29-32 are secured to and supported by
        the nuclear reactor housing 21 turbines as illustrated. The
        turbines may be of any suitable degree known in the art.
        However, the turbine must be capable of withstanding the
        corrosive effects of hydrogen chloride and highly ionized gases.
        The turbines are each connected directly to an electric power
        generator 33-36. The output of the power generators can be
        utilized for any suitable purpose. </p>
      <p>A chlorine conduit 37, an oxygen conduit 39 and a hydrogen
        conduit 41 are coupled to each of the reactor chambers with the
        hydrogen and chlorine providing the reactants in the
        electromagnetic reactor chambers and the oxygen being utilized
        as a control medium. In addition, as is known in the art,
        coolant conductors 43 are coupled to the nuclear reactor core to
        carry away therefrom the heat energy generated in the core. </p>
      <p>In operation, in the preferred embodiment, a coolant is
        circulated through the pipes 43 for the purpose of removing heat
        from the reactor core with the heat from the core being utilized
        to generate steam directly or via a suitable heat exchanger for
        the purpose of providing a means for driving steam turbine
        generators. In addition, the nuclear reactor produces thermal
        and electromagnetic energy during the nuclear transition and
        degradation within the core. As nuclear transformation and
        degradation occur, gamma radiation is reduced and alpha
        radiation increased. At least in part of this electromagnetic
        radiation is conducted through the sight glasses into each of
        the electromagnetic reactor chambers. At the same time hydrogen
        and chlorine gas are controllably fed into the reactor chambers
        together with oxygen. The high energy electromagnetic radiation
        is absorbed by the chlorine and hydrogen molecules in the
        presence of the oxygen. The resulting highly energized gases
        form hydrogen chloride as well as highly ionized chlorine and
        hydrogen. These highly energized gases generate heat and
        pressure in each of the reactors which energy is utilized to
        drive the respective turbines. By controlling the input of
        hydrogen and chlorine as well as oxygen or by controlling the
        amount of high energy radiation coupled to the reactor chamber,
        the desired energy levels can be achieved for driving the
        respective turbines. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIGS. 3 and 4 which are simplified schematic block
        diagrams of the power generation system of the present invention
        wherein the output of the electromagnetic reactor drives a
        magnetohydrodynamic generator. In this embodiment of the
        invention of the chlorine and hydrogen gases in the
        electromagnetic reactor chamber are highly ionized and the
        resulting charged particles are utilized as a medium for the
        magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators 51 that may be positioned
        in place of the gas turbines of FIG. 2, or in the alternative
        may be positioned at the output of the gas turbines to receive
        whatever ionized gases are passed through the turbine. As is
        known in the art the ionized hydrogen and chlorine atoms
        resulting from the absorption of gamma and alpha radiation by
        the chlorine and hydrogen are expanded into a reactor duct 55
        which is in the middle of a magnetic field produced by
        electromagnets 57 and 59. Electrodes 61 and 63 positioned inside
        and insulated from the wall of the reactor duct 55 receive the
        charged particles as they are deflected to the respective
        electrodes by the electromagnetic field generated by the
        magnets. Thus a positive potential is generated at one electrode
        and a negative potential at the other electrode thereby causing
        the generation of current. The output from the reactor duct may
        then be utilized by coupling the gases to a suitable storage or
        conversion units for converting the gases to molecular hydrogen
        chlorine for feeding back to the reactor chamber in the manner
        described in connection with FIG. 1. </p>
      <p>It should be understood by those skilled in the art that while
        a preferred embodiment has been disclosed in connection with the
        present invention there may be other embodiments which fall
        within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the
        appended claims. </p>

    <blockquote><b><i>Description</i></b>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to a system of producing
        methanol. </p>
      <p>The most recent technique for methanol synthesis involves a low
        pressure process by which synthesis gas is prepared. This
        synthesis gas is prepared by the steam reforming or partial
        oxidation of a liquid or gaseous hydrocarbon feedstock or by
        direct combination of carbon dioxide with purified hydrogen rich
        gases. Typically, naphtha or natural gas feedstock is
        desulfurized, preheated, mixed with a superheated steam and then
        reacted over a conventional catalyst in a multi-tubular
        reformer. After cooling, the synthesis gas is compressed to the
        required synthesis pressure. The synthesis gas is passed into a
        hot-wall convertor over a low pressure methanol synthesis
        catalyst at a temperature range of 250.degree. to 270.degree. C.
        The crude methanol thus formed is condensed and separated from
        the uncondensed gases which are recycled with makeup synthesis
        gas and fed back to the converter. See, for example, page 733 of
        the "Chemical and Process Technology Encyclopedia". </p>
      <p>In the aforementioned process and in other processes of
        producing methanol by techniques known today, it is necessary to
        provide production facilities where a large amount of hydrogen
        and carbon monoxide are produced by environmentally dangerous
        processes, by methane cracking and coking. These facilities are
        environmentally limited to certain heavy industrial areas of the
        world and necessitate long-range and expensive transport of the
        finished methanol. The transportation expense offsets the
        economic production of methanol in the volume heretofore
        contemplated. </p>
      <p>Merthanol, wood alcohol, has been and still is a key chemical
        used in the production of many industrial and consumer products
        and is now being sought after as a fuel. Thus, as petroleum
        products become less available and more expensive, the
        Government and consumers are seeking ways and techniques for
        reducing existing fuel shortages and the cost of new fuels. For
        example, see "Gasohol, A Technical Memorandum", September 1979;
        Congress of the United States, Office of Technology Assessment
        (OTA), Washington, D.C. 20510, page 60. In the introduction,
        this Memorandun states "In fiscal year 1979, OTA estimated that
        federal expenditures of between $13 and $17 million directly
        supported the development of alcohol fuels from biomass. In
        fiscal year 1980 the Administration's research activities are
        expected to be funded at a level between $18 and $25 million.
        Additional subsidies include $40 million in loan guarantees,
        exemption of the federal excise tax on gasohol (for domestic
        production and imports), eligibility of alcohol fuels for
        entitlement awards and an investment tax credit of 20% on
        alcohol fuels facilities." The most promising fuel to alleviate
        current and anticipated shortages is methanol. Methanol is
        produced from carbon feedstocks such as natural gas (methane)
        and coal which are in plentiful supply and are not dependent on
        grain as is ethanol. Methanol can be mixed with gasoline to form
        gasohol or even used independently as a fuel. Methanol, as a
        fuel, has a research octane rating of 106-115 and a motor octane
        rating of 88-92. When 9 parts gasoline are mixed with 1 part
        methanol, the research octane rating of the mix is increased
        from 91.1 to 95.5 octane, and the motor octane rating from 82.5
        to 84.5 octane. See, for example, pages 4-45, "Energy Technology
        Handbook", Douglas M. Considine, McGraw-Hill, Inc. </p>
      <p>Methanol is also a competitive way of tranporting natural gas
        from the wellhead to the consumer. Wellhead gas, which is
        currently being burned off into the atmosphere in many major oil
        fields outside the United States, is a potentially cheap fuel
        when converted to methanol and shipped to the marketplace. Other
        natural gas producing fields that are not accessible to gas
        pipelines are compressing the gas to liquid natural gas (LNG)
        and shipping the compressed gas to gasification plants that have
        access to gas pipelines. The conversion and shipping of methanol
        to gasification plants is a simpler, safer and more economical
        way of transporting natural gas. See pages 2-124, "Energy
        Technology Handbook", Douglas M. Considine, copyrighted 1977,
        McGraw-Hill, Inc. </p>
      <p>It therefore is an object of this invention to provide a method
        and apparatus for producing methanol by environmentally
        acceptable techniques. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method and
        apparatus for producing efficiently and economically both small
        and large quantities of methanol. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method and
        apparatus for producing methanol to be used as a fuel or fuel
        additive from pipeline or wellhead natural gas. </p>
      <p>It is another object of this invention to provide a method and
        apparatus for producing methanol as a transport medium of

      <p><b>SHORT STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method and
        apparatus for forming methanol. By the method, methane is
        conveyed to an electromagnetic combustion and condensing
        reactor. Oxygen is also conveyed into the reactor where it
        passes through an electromagnetic field and is atomized prior to
        convergence and combustion with the methane. The atomized oxygen
        combines stoichiometrically with the methane in an exothermic
        reaction to generate methanol gas which is condensed in the
        reactor to form liquid methanol. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>As illustrated in FIG. 1, an electromagnetic methanol reactor
        11 receives a supply of methane gas from a natural gas supply
        line 13. The methane is derived from a natural gas supply that
        has been scrubbed of nitrogen, hydrogen and carbon monoxide
        trace gases and is typically 96.5% pure methane. Molecular
        oxygen is fed to the electromagnetic reactor 11 via an oxygen
        supply line 15. The oxygen is derived from an electrolyzer plant
        or an air reduction plant and is typically 99.5% pure. The two
        gases, methane and oxygen, are fed into the reactor 11 at low
        pressure, under 75 psig, and low velocity. The molecular oxygen
        is passed between electrostatic plates 17 and 19 which form a
        gap therebetween. A high voltage transformer 23 is powered by an
        alternating current supply line 21. The output of transformer 23
        is variable and can be adjusted to provide between 1,000 and
        10,000 volts on the secondary winding. The spacing of the
        electrostatic plates 17 and 19 is adjusted to prevent arcing
        between the plates 17 and 19 depending on the density of the
        flow volume of the oxygen and the dielectric characteristics of
        the oxygen. The electrostatic field between the plates 17 and 19
        generates heat by hysteresis action sufficient to weaken and
        break the bond between the oxygen atoms prior to their
        combination with the methane molecules. The reaction is
        observed, visibly and spectroscopically, via sight glass 14. The
        combustion temperature should be in the neighborhood of
        1200.degree. C. The oxidation and reduction of the methane
        molecules by the oxygen atoms forms methyl molecules CH<sub>3</sub>
        and hydroxy molecules OH that combine to form the methanol
        molecules, i.e., methanol gas, by the following reaction: </p>
      <p>CH<sub>4</sub> +O.fwdarw.CH<sub>3</sub>OH </p>
      <p>The methanol gas thus formed in the reactor chamber 11 rises in
        the reactor column encountering vortex baffle plates 28 in the
        center of the reactor column to decrease the velocity of the
        methanol gas and direct the gas to the walls of the water cooled
        helical coils 12 and to the air cooled wall 27 of the reactor
        column. The reactor column wall 27 is air cooled or water cooled
        to 64.degree. C. or lower which is below the boiling point of
        methanol liquid. The cooling water passed through the helical
        coils 12 is conveyed with respect to the coils 12 via lines 22
        and 24 and reduces the temperature of the methanol gas inside
        the reactor 11 below the critical temperature of 240.degree. C.
        and the critical pressure of 78.7 atmospheres to a temperature
        of less than 112.degree. C. and to a pressure of less than 5
        atmospheres. The methanol gas cools as its velocity is slowed
        during its rise up the reactor column 11 and as it is repeatedly
        directed to the walls of the water cooled helical coils 12 and
        the cool wall 27 of the reactor column 11. The methanol gas is
        cooled and pressurized to form liquid methanol prior to reaching
        the top of the reactor 11 column because it condenses on the
        walls of the water cooled helical coils 12 and the reactor wall
        27. To increase the rate of reaction, methanol liquid is taken
        from line 31 via line 18 and pumped via pump 16 into spray
        nozzles 35 along the reactor column wall 27. The liquid methanol
        is atomized by the spray nozzles 35 and vaporized on contact
        with the hot methanol gas producing methanol vapor. The methanol
        vapor produced by the reaction condenses rapidly on contact with
        the cool reactor column wall 27 and helical coils 12. Any
        methanol gas not condensed prior to reaching the top of the
        reactor column 11 is vented via line 26 to an additional
        condensing stage. As the condensed methanol vapors accumulate on
        the walls of the helical coils 12 and the wall 27 of the reactor
        column 11, the liquid condensate, i.e., methanol liquid,
        gravitates down the wall 27 to the bottom of the reactor 11 and
        down through line 31 via port 29 to a storage reservoir. Port 29
        and line 31 are designed to retain liquid methanol to a desired
        level in the bottom of the reactor 11. Light trace gases,
        primarily, nitrogen, accumulate in the reactor dome and build up
        pressure in the reactor which increases the rate of condensation
        of the methanol gas at the top end of the reactor column 11. The
        pressure is maintained at or below a predetermined level in the
        reactor column 11 to prevent back pressure on the burner at the
        bottom of the reactor 11 thereby sustaining the desired
        stoichiometric combination of oxygen and methane, and is vented
        by a pressure loaded check valve 32. The dimensions of the
        reactor 11 are directly proportional to the desired volume of
        the reactants, the cooling medium and pressure levels of the
        reactor. </p>
      <p>Refer now to FIG. 2 where there is illustrated an alternate
        embodiment of the electromagnetic reactor of the present
        invention. As illustrated in FIG. 2, an electromagnetic methanol
        reactor 11 receives a supply of natural gas via supply line 13.
        The natural gas being typically composed of 96.5% methane, 3%
        nitrogen, 0.5% hydrogen and a trace of carbon monoxide when
        furnished from a natural gas supplier or after treatment of
        wellhead gas. Molecular oxygen is fed to the electromagnetic
        reactor 11 via supply line 15. The oxygen is derived from an
        electrolyzer plant, an air reduction plant or from air. The
        oxygen derived from ambient air is typically 75% nitrogen, 24%
        oxygen and 1% trace gases, e.g., helium, hydrogen, neon, argon,
        etc. The gases, natural gas and atmospheric oxygen, are fed into
        the reactor 11 at low pressure, e.g., under 75 psig, and at a
        low velocity. The molecular oxygen and/or air is passed between
        electrostatic plates 17 and 19 which form a gap therebetween. A
        high voltage transformer 23 is energized from an alternating
        current supply line 21. The output of transformer 23 is variable
        between 1,000 and 10,000 volts depending upon the input voltage
        and, of course, the transformer ratio. The spacing of the
        electrostatic plates 17 and 19 is adjusted to prevent arcing
        between the plates 17 and 19 depending on the density of the
        flow of the atmospheric oxygen and the dielectric
        characteristics thereof. The electrostatic field between the
        plates 17 and 19 weakens and breaks the bond between the oxygen
        atoms prior to their combustion with the methane molecules in
        the natural gas. Other molecules mixed with the oxygen when it
        is derived from air, such as nitrogen, are not atomized. The
        electrostatic plates are adjusted to break oxygen molecular
        bonds with a heat of atomization of 59.5 Kcal per g-atom.
        Nitrogen requires 113 Kcal per g-atom. The oxidation of the
        methane molecules by the oxygen atoms forms methanol molecules,
        i.e., methanol gas, with a weight of 32 grams per mole. The
        nitrogen in the reactor 11 does not chemically react and form
        other molecular bonds due to the low heat of the methaneoxygen
        burn. The methanol gas which is formed by the process is cooled
        and condensed by the same method described in connection with
        FIG. 1. Nitrogen at 28 grams per mole, trace hydrogen at 2 grams
        per mole, which are not reacted with atomic oxygen, and trace
        carbon monoxide at 28 grams per mole are vented out of the
        reactor via port 33 through stack line 34. The size of port 33
        and stack line 34 are designed to hold a predetermined back
        pressure on the chamber to accelerate the rate of condensation
        of the methanol gas. </p>
      <p>While the present invention has been disclosed in connection
        with the preferred embodiment thereof, other design
        configurations of gas reacting and condensing columns with other
        types of cooling systems may be utilized to react methane and
        atomic oxygen to form methanol gas and to condense said gas to
        methanol liquid and it should be understood that other
        embodiments of the invention may be used in accordance with the
        spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended
        claims. </p>

      <b>Abstract -- </b>A detonation cycle gas turbine engine includes
      a turbine rotor contained within a housing. Exhaust ports of
      respective valveless combustion chambers on opposite sides of the
      rotor direct combustion gases toward the turbine. The chambers are
      connected by a valveless manifold fed with fuel and oxidizer. When
      combustible gases are detonated by an igniter in one of the
      combustion chambers, the back pressure from the detonation shuts
      off the fuel and oxidizer flow to that chamber and redirects the
      fuel and oxidizer to the opposite chamber, where detonation
      occurs, the process repeats cyclically. Power is taken off the
      rotor shaft mechanically or electrically.

      <p><i>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>The invention described hereinafter is directed to the field of
        detonation cycle gas turbines and to the methods and apparatus
        constituting said turbine system. </p>
      <p>In the field of gas turbines and piston engines, there are
        different methods and apparatus which are utilized to convert
        the kinetic and thermal energy of gas reactions in combustion
        chambers to extract useful work. The design of the combustion
        chambers, the expanders, the type of fuel, the fuel-air ratio,
        the pressure of the fuel-air mixture prior to ignition, and the
        type of ignition, all determine the rate of oxidation. The rate
        of oxidation determines and defines whether the fuel and the
        oxidizer produce a constant propagating flame, a deflagrating
        explosion and accelerated flame front, or a detonation and high
        velocity shock waves. In either case, the oxidizer must be
        activated or raised to a higher energy level by some means to
        initiate the oxidation reaction. The manner of the activation
        will vary the rate of the reaction and produce the variation in
        result from a flame, to a deflagrating explosion, to a
        detonation. </p>
      <p>The methods and apparatus utilized in an Otto cycle spark
        ignition gasoline piston engines are variable volume--constant
        pressure--combustion chambers, that induce and compress air and
        fuel mixtures to 6 or more atmospheres reducing the atmospheric
        ignition temperature from 1,000 degree F to 500 degree F, then
        ignite the mixture with an electric spark producing low power
        photolytic and radiolytic radiation, typically 80 millijoules,
        that activates and disassociates oxygen and hydrocarbon
        molecules in the immediate proximity of the electric spark,
        resulting in a deflagrating explosion with an accelerated flame
        front. The thermal energy of the flame front propagates
        throughout the mixture, thermally activating and chemically
        combining remaining reactants in a "chain burn" with typical
        mean pressures of 90 pounds per square inch gauge over a time
        period of 8 to 16 milliseconds while expanding the pistons down
        the chambers. The methods and apparatus utilized in Otto cycle
        engines are not useable with Diesel cycle engines, Brayton cycle
        or Detonation cycle turbines. Otto cycle engines in the 200
        horsepower range typically utilize 9 pounds of air and 0.6
        pounds of fuel per horsepower hour while producing 9.6 pounds of
        exhaust gas per horsepower hour. </p>
      <p>The methods and apparatus utilized in Diesel cycle compression
        ignition diesel fuel piston engines are variable
        volume--constant pressure--combustion chambers, that induce and
        compress air to 15 or more atmospheres, and injects compressed
        fuel in the top of the chamber at the top of the compression
        stroke. Molecules of oxygen and hydrocarbons disassociate when
        compressed against the hot head of the combustion chambers
        resulting in free radicals that chemically combine exothermally
        in a deflagrating explosion with an accelerated flame front. The
        thermal energy of the flame front probagates throughout the
        mixture, thermally activating and chemically combining remaining
        reactants in a "chain burn" with mean pressures typically in
        excess of 90 pounds per square inch gauge over a time period of
        12 to 24 milliseconds while expanding the pistons down the
        chambers. The methods and apparatus utilized in in Diesel cycle
        engines, are not useable with Otto cycle engines, Brayton cycle
        or Detonation cycle turbines. Diesel cycle piston engines in the
        200 horsepower range typically utilize 11 pounds of air and 0.55
        pounds of fuel per horsepower hour while producing 11.55 pounds
        of exhaust gas per horsepower hour. </p>
      <p>The methods and apparatus utilized in Brayton cycle compression
        ignition turbine fuel gas turbines are constant volume--constant
        flow--constant pressure combustion chambers; a compressor that
        compresses air from 3 to 6 atmospheres; a pump that compresses
        fuel up to 40 atmospheres; and an axial flow or radial inflow
        turbine expander. Compressed air is fed into the combustion
        chamber and combined with the hot compressed fuel. An Infrared
        glow plug is often utilized to increase the thermal activation
        of the oxygen and hydrocarbon molecules, at the surface of the
        plug, to bring the mixture to the ignition temperature. Ignition
        occurs as a very low pressure deflagrating explosion with a
        constant pressure flame front. The thermal energy produced by
        the flame front radiates thermal waves with sufficient energy to
        continuously ignite the constant flowing high pressure fuel-air
        mixture and expand the surplus air in the burn plennum to drive
        the turbine while maintaining a constant pressure. Maintaining
        constant pressure is critical. Variation of pressures in the
        combustion chambers will cause flame out. Over pressure in the
        plennum will stall the compressor. The methods and apparatus
        utilized in a Brayton cycle turbine are not useable with Otto
        cycle or Diesel cycle engines, nor Detonation cycle turbines.
        Brayton cycle gas turbines In the 200 horsepower range, operated
        in an open cycle configuration at sea level, typically utilize
        40 pounds of air and 1.2 pounds of fuel per horsepower hour,
        while producing 41.2 pounds of exhaust gas per horsepower hour.
      </p>
      <p><i>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</i> </p>
      <p>The methods and apparatus utilized in this invention, a
        Detonation Cycle Gas Turbine, are two constant volume -- cyclic
        flow -- combustion chambers connected by a common manifold; a
        blower that produces and supplies low pressure air to the
        manifold; a fuel pump that supplies low pressure gaseous fuel to
        the combustion chambers; and a constant visible arc ignition;
        and a positive displacement turbine. The blower supplies air to
        the combustion chambers via the manifold. Fuel is Injected into
        venturis in the manifold next to the combustion chambers. The
        high power, 300 joule, arc ignitions, producing photolytic and
        radiolytic particles and waves disassociates oxygen and
        hydrocarbon molecules throughout the combustion chambers,
        producing complete detonation and high velocity shock waves that
        kinetically compress the remaining inert gases in the combustion
        chambers. Detonation pressures exceed 80 atmospheres and produce
        mean chamber pressures of 20 atmospheres to drive the turbine.
        The methods and apparatus utilized in Detonation cycle gas
        turbine are not useable with Brayton cycle gas turbines, nor
        Otto cycle and Diesel cycle engines. The Detonation cycle gas
        turbine, operated in an open cycle configuration at sea level in
        the 200 horsepower range, typically utilizes 5.2 pounds of air
        and 0.3 pounds of fuel per horsepower hour while producing 5.5
        pounds of exhaust gas per horsepower hour. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes a modified Pelton Water Wheel, as the
        turbine wheel, with blades that are positively displaced through
        a blade race by kinetic impact and expansion of gases exiting
        from combustion chambers via nozzles, rather than pistons, axial
        flow, or radial inflow expanders. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes a turbine housing with a turbine wheel
        chamber that directs expanding gases through a positive
        displacement blade race tangentially followed by an expanded
        blade race to an exhaust port. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes a blower, rather than a compressor, to
        supply less air per horsepower hour than required by existing
        gas turbines or piston engines, thereby producing less exhaust
        gas per horsepower hour. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes a blower, rather than a compressor, to
        supply low pressure air, less than 2 atmospheres, via a single
        manifold to two combustion chambers simultaneously. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes a blower, rather than a compressor, to
        supply less air at lower pressure; thereby consuming less work
        to complete a detonation cycle, resulting in higher
        thermomechanical efficiencies than gas turbines or piston
        engines. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes manifolds, combustion chambers and
        ignition systems that have the capability of cyclically
        detonating fuel-air mixtures without utilizing valves. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes fuel pumps and vaporizers to gasify wet
        fuels prior to mixing with combustion air to produce more
        complete combustion of fuel-air mixtures in the detonation
        process. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes venturis in the manifolds to uniformly
        mix gaseous fuels with combustion air prior to injection in the
        combustion chambers to produce complete combustion of fuel-air
        mixtures in the detonation process. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes a plasma arc ignition, a visibly
        constant illuminating plasma flame between two electrodes, to
        detonate fuel air mixtures and does not require critical
        Ignition timing. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes low pressure air and fuel mixtures that
        are detonated instanteously, in less than one millisecond,
        producing high velocity shock waves that kinetically compress
        inert gases resulting in higher working pressures than the
        pressures produced in constant pressure heating utilized in
        Brayton cycle turbines, Otto and Diesel cycle piston engines. </p>
      <p>This invention utilizes a detonation cycle that utilizes less
        working fluid and produces significantly less exhaust gas per
        horsepower hour than Brayton cycle turbines, Otto or Diesel
        cycle piston engines. </p>
      <p>At least one turbine is provided in driving relation to a shaft
        supported in bearings mounted in opposite end walls of a housing
        for the turbine. The side walls of the housing are ported to
        accommodate combustion chambers, expansion chambers and exhaust
        ports. The combustion chambers are secured to the housing over
        each respective port, with the firewall end of the chamber
        facing the periphery of the turbine. Expansion chambers and
        exhaust ports are positioned downstream from the combustion
        chambers. Nozzles are ported in the firewalls of the combustion
        chambers, extend and are directed to the periphery of the
        turbine. High-voltage electrodes are positioned in the wall of
        each combustion chamber and are continuously fired by high
        frequency high-voltage transformer and capacitor networks. A low
        static pressure rotary blower is driven by the turbine shaft to
        supply air as an oxidizer via a common manifold feeding two
        combustion chambers. Fuel gas, injected into venturi turbes on
        the downstream end of the manifold, mixes with the oxidizer and
        is fed into the combustion chambers at low static pressure. Both
        radiolytic and photolytic radiation produced by the high
        voltage-high frequency plasma arcs in the combustion chambers
        atomizes and ionizes oxygen molecules initiating instantaneous
        oxidization and detonation producing high-pressure shock waves
        that kinetically compress Inert gas molecules in the chambers.
        The resulting high-pressure compressed gases are directed from
        the combustion chambers to the periphery of the turbine via
        nozzles. The high pressure compressed gases, when exhausted from
        the nozzles, kinetically impact positive displacement blades on
        the periphery of the turbine, imparting momentum to the turbine.
        As the turbine rotates, the compressed gases expand across the
        periphery of the turbine blades into an expansion chamber
        further accelerating the turbine. The compressed gases continue
        to expand via the respective exhaust ports. The torque produced
        by the acceleration of the turbine and shaft is converted to
        work or power by conventional mechanical or electrical means.
        Acceleration, torque, and resulting power output can be
        increased or decreased by the volumes of combustion chambers,
        the number of combustion chambers and turbines, the radius of
        the turbines, and the amount of air and fuel utilized. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>In the illustrated preferred embodiment, the Detonation Cycle
        Gas Turbine is illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. Referring to FIGS.
        1 and 2, the turbine system includes a straight drive shaft 12
        on which are mounted for rotation with the drive shaft, a
        positive displacement turbine wheel 11, a conventional rotary
        blower 48, a conventional flywheel 49 and a conventional power
        take-off unit 35 operatively connected to a conventional
        alternator 37. </p>
      <p>The turbine engine further includes a block 30 (FIG. 1) having
        end walls in which the drive shaft 12 is journalled for
        rotation. The block 30 has an internal cavity in which the
        turbine 11 is housed, this cavity includes two axially opposite
        end walls and an outer peripheral wall. The block 30 is suitably
        air, water or chemical cooled. </p>
      <p>The turbine wheel 11 (FIG. 2) has a plurality of blades mounted
        on the radially outer periphery thereof at a plurality of
        equiangularly spaced sites. The individual blades extend axially
        from end wall to end wall of the internal cavity, and from the
        outer peripheral wall of the turbine wheel to the outer
        peripheral wall of the internal cavity. Suitable slide bearing
        surface are provided between the turbine blades and cavity
        walls. Accordingly, a succession of chambers is defined in a
        series about the turbine wheel 11 between angularly successive
        turbine blades. </p>
      <p>The turbine engine has two combustion chambers, chambers 14 and
        15 having respective firewalls 24, 25, provided at the inner end
        walls thereof. Fuel-oxidizer manifold ports are provided through
        the outer end walls thereof. A common inlet manifold 47 for
        low-pressure oxidizer gas, is intersected at inlet venturi
        throats 20, 21 by fuel inlet orifices 18, 19. </p>
      <p>In accordance with principles of the invention, the combustion
        chambers are intersected between the inlet and firewall thereof
        by electrodes 22, 23, the inner ends of which are disposed
        within the combustion chambers, for providing a visible plasma
        arc therein during operation of the turbine engine. Through each
        firewall, directional nozzles 16, 17 communicate through the
        radially outer peripheral wall of the internal cavity of the
        block 30. </p>
      <p>Generally, one-eighth of the way around the internal cavity of
        the block 30 from where nozzles 16, 17 intersects the outer
        peripheral wall of the internal cavity, the internal cavity is
        provided with expansion chambers 26, 27 leading outward to
        exhaust ports 32, 33. </p>
      <p>The turbine, block, combustion chambers, inlets and outlets may
        be made of materials and using constructional techniques that
        are utterly conventional in the manufacture of piston and
        turbine engines. </p>
      <p>The fuel supply (FIG. 1) for the turbine engine includes two
        fuel tanks. Fuel tank 42 is for gaseous fuels and fuel tank 43
        for wet fuels. Both are connected by a fuel line to both
        orifices 18,19, via a throttle regulator valve 44. Fuel tank 43
        has a motor 54 that drives a wet fuel pump 52 and sprays fuel
        into a fuel vaporizer 53 that converts the wet fuel to gas which
        is fed to throttle regulator valve 44. </p>
      <p>The oxidizer supply for the turbine engine includes a manifold
        47 connecting both venturi inlets 20, 21 with the output side of
        the rotary blower 48. At an upstream end of the manifold 47, a
        check valve 45 is provided for preventing compressed oxidizer
        backflow towards the blower. </p>
      <p>The electrical system for the turbine engine system includes a
        battery 36, a starter motor 34, a voltage rectifer 31, a voltage
        regulator 28, an alternator 37, a power switch 46, and two high
        voltage ignition transformers 40,41. In operation, the power
        switch 46 is turned on to actuate the system, and engages the
        starter motor 34 with the battery 36. The starter motor 34
        engages the flywheel 49 thus turning the drive shaft 12, power
        take off 35, alternator 37, and the air blower 48. The air
        blower 48, driven by the drive shaft 12, produces low pressure
        air that is fed via the check valve 45 and manifold 47 to the
        inlet venturis 20,21. Fuel gas from fuel tank 42 or 43 is
        throttled via regulator valve 44 into the low pressure air
        stream via orifices 18,19 and into the chambers 14,15, via the
        venturis 20,21. The alternator 37 provides electrical power to
        high voltage transformers 40,41, that supply high voltage to arc
        electrodes 22,23. </p>
      <p>According to the preferred design, the low pressure air
        manifold piping to the combustion chamber 14 is shorter in
        length than that to the combustion chamber 15. Accordingly, the
        fuel-air detonation occurs in combustion chamber 14, closely
        followed by one in combustion chamber 15 and so, in alternation.
        The cyclic detonations in combustion chambers 14 and 15 produce
        high pressure gases that expand, and via the respective nozzles
        16, 17, kinetically impact and expand across respective ones of
        the blades of the turbine wheel 11, thereby turning the drive
        shaft 12 to provide rotary output to the power take-off unit 35.
        The power take-off unit 35 turns the alternator 37 that
        generates DC power via the voltage rectifier 31 and voltage
        regulator 28 to maintain a full charge on the battery 36, and
        provides continuous AC power to the high voltage transformers
        44,41. The air blower 48 rotation is sustained by the drive
        shaft 12. </p>
      <p>By preference, the rotary blower 48, produces static air
        pressure in the range of 3.5 to 15 pounds per square inch gauge,
        at the output side of the blower. </p>
      <p>The gaseous fuel contained in the fuel tank 42 preferably
        comprises propane. However, other gaseous fuels such as
        hydrogen, acetylene, butane, compressed natural gas can be
        utilized. The liquid (wet) fuels contained in fuel tank 43
        preferably comprises gasoline, however, other wet fuels such as
        diesel fuel, methanol, ethanol, or liquid natural gas can be
        utilized. The fuel delivery pressure (obtained by pressurizing
        the fuel tank and/or by using a wet fuel pump 52 and fuel
        vaporizer 53 for boosting fuel pressure in the fuel delivery
        line to the orifices 18,19) is preferably in the range of 7.5 to
        20 pounds per square inch gauge, and at least slightly higher
        than the aforementioned air oxidizer pressure. </p>
      <p>The high voltage transformers 40,41 preferably includes a 60 to
        400 cycle, 120 volts AC, primary winding with a 15,000 volt AC
        center-tapped secondary winding with capacitors in parallel
        across each winding, creating an electrical tank circuit that
        oscillates at high frequency and supplies electrical power to
        the arc electrodes 22 and 23. Each 7,500 volt secondary
        transformer winding and capacitor network oscillates at 100,000
        cycles per second at 40 milliamperes, delivering 300 joule to
        each of the arc electrodes 22,23. </p>
      <p>Each arc electrode 22,23 produces electromagnetic radiation,
        both photolytic and radiolytic, from the high frequency plasma
        arc gaps. The density and power of the radiated photons and
        charged radiolytic particles produced by the arcs at electrodes
        22 and 23 scatter throughout the chamber and the low pressure
        air fuel mixture, kinetically impact and split oxygen molecules.
        The oxygen atoms, oxidize the fuel molecules instantaneously
        throughout the chamber producing a detonation and high velocity
        shock waves through the chamber. </p>
      <p>The pressure of the shock waves resulting from the detonations
        compress remaining inert gases in the chambers into high
        pressure masses. At the time of each detonation, the
        overpressure momentarily shuts off the air and fuel flow at
        respective orifice 18, 19 and venturi turbe 21,22. The
        compressed gases that exhaust via the respective directional
        nozzle 16,17 disposed in the firewall section 24,25 of
        respective combustion chamber 14,15 kinetically impact the
        elliptical blades in the peripheral cavities 13 on the outer
        radial surface of the turbine wheel 11. The turbine wheel 11
        rotates on and turns the drive shaft 12 in the direction of the
        impact of the pressurized gas masses. The expanding gases expand
        over the tops of the turbine blades which are positioned on the
        radial surface of the turbine at intervals that permit impulse
        and expansion of the compressed gases into the expansion chamber
        27, further accelerating the turbine. During the cut off period
        of orifice 18 and venturi 21, the blower air or other oxidizer
        is redirected via the manifold 47 to combustion chamber 15 via
        venturi 20 and fuel orifice 19 where the detonation process is
        repeated. </p>
      <p>The blower 48 volume, manifold 47 volume, combustion chambers
        14, 15 volumes and nozzles 16, 17 volumes are preferably
        balanced to produce an average displacement that results in
        fifteen detonations per second per chamber. </p>
      <p>The mean inlet temperature at the outlets of nozzles 16 and 17
        are the average temperatures of the compressed gases impacting
        the turbine 11 and elliptical bladed cavities 13 and are
        controlled by the number of detonations per second per chamber.
        The temperature drop across the turbine 11 is equal to the inlet
        temperature at the outlet of nozzle 16 less the outlet
        temperature at exhaust port 32, plus the inlet temperature at
        the outlet of nozzle 17, less the outlet temperature at exhaust
        port 33. </p>
      <p>The speed of rotation of the turbine 11 during operation can be
        regulated by changing the fuel flow input into the combustion
        chamber 14 and 15 via orifices 18 and 19 with fuel valve 44. As
        the fuel is leaned, the detonations become less powerful,
        therefore slowing the turbine 11 and blower 48. As the fuel is
        enriched, the detonations become more powerful and the turbine
        11 and blower 48 increases speed. The greater the range of the
        flammability of the fuel, the greater the range of control over
        the speed of the turbine 11 rotation. </p>
      <p>Typical input requirements, at mean operating power, for the
        preferred embodiment of the system are as follows: </p>
      <p>Fuel 0.3 pound propane per horsepower hour. </p>
      <p>Air 5.3 pounds per horsepower hour. </p>
      <p>This is about one-half the air and fuel needed per horsepower
        of output for Otto cycle and Diesel cycle piston engines, and
        about one-eighth that required for the same output by Brayton
        cycle turbine engines. </p>
      <p>Operation of the Detonation cycle turbine is terminated by
        closing fuel regulator valve 44 and disengaging switch 46. </p>
      <p>It is within the contemplation of the invention that a
        plurality of the turbines, all in the same block, or in a
        succession of blocks be constructed and jointly operated in the
        same manner to drive the same drive shaft 12. </p>
      <p>Reiterating the cyclic operation, and the methods and apparatus
        utilized in the invention; the switch is engaged connecting the
        starter to the battery; the starter engages the flywheel and
        rotates the shaft, the power take-off, the air blower, and the
        alternator. Air is fed into the common manifold connecting the
        two combustion chambers. Gaseous fuel is injected into the
        venturis and mixed with air. The fuel-air mixture is injected
        into both chambers. Photolytic and radiolytic radiation produced
        by the plasma arcs across the high voltage electrodes in the
        chambers atomizes the oxidizer and produces a detonation in one
        of the combustion chambers. The overpressure of the first
        detonation, in the respective combustion chamber, momentarily
        shuts off the fuel and oxidizer flow at the combustion chamber
        input orifice and venturi tube and the fluid flow reverts to the
        opposing combustion chamber, via the manifold, where the second
        detonation occurs. The overpressure mass, compressed gases,
        products of the cyclic deonations, are cyclically exhausted via
        nozzles into elliptical bladed cavities on the peripheral
        surface of the turbine. After each detonation, the pressure in
        the respective combustion chamber and manifold drops below the
        air and fuel injection pressure on completion of exhausting the
        combusted gases via the nozzle, and a new charge of air and fuel
        is injected by the manifold and respective venturi tube, into
        the respective combustion chamber, and the detonation repeats.
        The impulse of the high-pressure high-velocity mass kinetically
        impacts the elliptical blades of the turbine forcing it to
        rotate. As the turbine rotates the compressed gases expand out
        of the cavity and across the periphery of the elliptical blades
        into the expansion chamber and out the exhaust pushing the
        turbine into faster rotation. The torque produced by the
        acceleration of the turbine and shaft is converted mechanically
        and/or electrically. Acceleration and torque are determined by
        various volumes of fuel-oxidizer mixes, volumes of combustion
        chambers and nozzles, number of combustion chambers and number
        and radius of turbines. </p>
      <p>The invention may be further understood with reference to the
        concrete example, a prototype engine test, that is illustrated
        and graphically presented in FIGS. 3-7. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 3, there is shown a turbine engine system of FIGS. 1
        and 2, incorporated in an acceleration testing system, results
        of the operation of which are described below in relation to the
        charts shown in FIGS. 4-7. </p>
