        </big></div>
      <br>
      Dubbed the Primer Fields, this revolutionary new idea has been
      tested extensively using special shaped magnets and plasma. A test
      chamber put under vacuum and then filled with different gas types
      to create specific light effects. Magnets in the shape of bowls
      that have a hole in the bottom are suspended in the chamber via
      thin filaments. A whip=like electrode inside the chamber is used
      to create plasma in the gas. Most important part of this setup is
      the Bowl shaped magnets. I’m not sure how exactly they were able
      to construct these magnets; but they are either Negatively
      polarized or positively polarized.<br>
      <br>
      When placing a negative and positive bowl near near each other in
      the chamber, a very peculiar effect happens with the plasma. Most
      of the plasma in the chamber collects in the space between the
      bowls. It rotates at a high rate of speed and streamers of plasma
      are ejected from the holes in the bottom of the bowl shaped
      magnets.<br>
      <br>
      The theory is that every component of matter has a double
      toroidial (bowl) shaped magnetic field that radiates from it’s
      core. Even the structures of the universe resemble this pattern.
      These videos demonstrate the effect and theory very well. If this
      were proven to be fact, large portions of our physics platform
      would have to be restructured... <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A device with the ability to harness electrical power utilizing
      magnetic arrays and electrically charged particulate to produce
      electrical power is provided. The present invention provides a
      device and system whereby the device may utilize a magnetic array
      to produce a electronic field that may collected in the form of
      electric energy. Moreover, the present invention provides a device
      having power generation effects whereby the device utilizes an
      arrangement of magnets on a magnetic array and a voltage ring
      having an input and an output connection to allow for discharge of
      collected electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to a power generator. More
      specifically, the field of invention is to a power generator
      device that may utilize an electric and magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Electrical power is one of the most important components of our
      everyday lives. We use electrical energy to almost everything,
      from electronics, to water heaters, to light bulbs and even cars.
      However, generating the electrical power that we need has not
      always been an easy process. Most of our electrical power is
      generated by burning coal and/or from hydroelectric generation.
      Burning coal can be expensive and may have adverse effects on the
      environment, wherein the environmental effects of hydro-electric
      generation are not as extreme, but may still disrupt a very
      fragile eco-system.<br>
      <br>
      Hydro-electricity generators change the energy of moving water
      into electrical energy. The generators may produce electrical
      current by using a continuous flow of water to turn a water
      turbine that is connected to an electricity generator and/or
      alternator. Water flows from a dam or reservoir to the turbine
      through a huge pipe called a penstock. The water passes through a
      spiral-shaped pipe making it spin. The spinning water makes the
      turbine turn. In order to maintain consistency, the speed of the
      turbine should remain constant so that the amount of electrical
      energy being produced remains the same at all times. Any
      fluctuation in the amount of electrical energy being produced
      could cause instability and breakdown of the generators and/or
      circuits and capacitors used to contain and store the electrical
      energy produced. The amount of electricity that may be produced
      from hydro-electric generation may depend on the rate on which the
      water flows and the difference in height between the water in the
      top of the dam or reservoir and the water in the lower part for
      the reservoir below the turbine.<br>
      <br>
      However, as more and more hydroelectric stations go up, so do the
      number of dams and reservoirs necessary to facilitate the
      hydroelectric generation process. The increased number of dams and
      reservoirs have an adverse affect on the environment around them,
      by swamping lush growing land, and disrupting the natural flow of
      water. Moreover, the institution of dams and reservoirs disrupts
      the natural eco-system of an area by creating and/or destroying
      natural eco-systems.<br>
      <br>
      A newer energy generator has been to use the electric properties
      of a magnet to produce electrical power. More specifically, every
      electron is essentially a small magnet. The combination of a
      plurality of electrons may create a magnetic field. This magnet
      field is typically caused by the electron's orbital motion about
      the nucleus and may produce as a by-product a limited electrical
      field. If this electrical field is properly harnessed, it may be
      able to produce sufficient power to be useable by an individual.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, what is needed is a power generation device that
      produces sufficient power while utilizing magnetic power and
      without the need for significant power input. Further, a device is
      needed that may produce sufficient power without the need for
      elaborate and costly electric generation devices.<br>
      SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

      Additionally, the present invention provides a device and system

      electronic field that may collected in the form of electric
      energy. Moreover, the present invention provides a device having
      power generation effects whereby the device utilizes an
      arrangement of magnets to change the flow of ions and/or electrons
      to produce a change in the magnetic field and thereby allow for
      productions of electrical current from same.<br>

      insulation, and stable up to temperatures of 1000° C., with very
      little thermal expansion or outgassing.<br>
      <br>
      Left and right side feed tubes 6, 7 are aligned in an x direction,
      such that a surface of the feed tubs 6, 7 and focus nozzles 11, 12
      are defined by a radius r extending in an y, z direction, rotating
      about the x axis. Right and left side ground rods 9, 10 are
      affixed within the right and left side feed tubes 6, 7,
      respectively. Magnetic arrays 1, 2 surround the left and right
      side feed tubes 6, 7, respectively, at one end close to the
      chamber covers 4, 5 and high voltage ring mount 3. The ground rods
      9, 10, feed tubs 6, 7 and magnetic arrays 1, 2 are aligned to
      extend in the x direction. The high voltage ring 8 is aligned so
      as to extend only in the y and z directions as the ring is
      traversed, with its thickness extending in the x direction. The
      magnetic arrays 1, 2 are formed with anisotropic rare-earth
      magnets having an alignment as shown in FIG. 1. That is, the
      alignment of the magnets extend diagonally from ends of the
      magnetic array cylinders 1, 2. Magnets in magnetic array 1 are
      aligned with north poles in. Magnets in magnetic array 2 are
      aligned with south poles in.<br>
      <br>
      An operation of the power generator apparatus will now be
      described. The ground rods 9, 10 are at ground. The high voltage
      ring 8 is held to a high pulsed DC voltage of around 100 kV 25
      through input connection point 13. When output connection point 14
      is connected to a stainless steel bolt having about a one inch gap
      from another stainless steel bolt connected to ground, current
      flow is about 700 p.A. The charge difference causes a flow from
      ground rods 9, 10 through orifices 11, 12, and out to high voltage
      ring 8.<br>
      <br>
      As the matter passes through the magnet arrays 1, 2 the fields of
      each particle are aligned so as to enter fusion orifices 11, 12
      with opposite charge fields toward each other so that the matter
      entering from the left side is attracted to the matter from the
      right side. This results in fusion and a great release of energy.
      Parts 6, 7, 3, 4, and 5 form an airtight chamber on which a vacuum
      can be pulled. The unit can be operated at atmospheric pressure
      and produce energy with no moving parts.<br>
      <br>
      The chamber unit could be constructed of many different materials.
      In an exemplary embodiment, the unit can be formed of
      polycarbonate, but a flexible fabric could be used for atmospheric
      operation.<br>
      <br>
      When a vacuum is pulled to 30? HG, the visible flow inside the
      chamber is visible as a beryl colored glow. The flow appears as
      counter rotating tornadoes. The flow extends from both the right
      and left sides down through the orifices 11, 12, and then
      exploding out into many (thousands plus) flow streams out to the
      high voltage ring. Because of the fusion reaction, the high
      voltage ring 8 receives the produced energy in the form of
      electricity which is output from 13. The fields produced by the
      power generator apparatus are very large in comparison to the
      machine side, total machine size is 4' long, with a 7? diameter
      high voltage ring 8. The fields produced by power generator
      apparatus fill an entire 7700 sq. ft. building with a 20' ceiling.<br>
      <br>
      The fields obey the principles of the structure of matter as
      outlined earlier. These fields possess a great ability to clean
      the air way beyond normal electrostatic air cleaners. These
      charged fields are also great for human, animal, life, etc. Within
      the 7700 sq. ft. building there is an amazing air quality. The
      magnetic arrays can be spun to increase the rate of fusion.<br>
      <br>
      Design of arrays to be optimized probably at tornado like shape
      would be the optimum. The fields could also possibly be confined
      into a smaller high density, high energy unit per sketch K of FIG.
      11.<br>
      <br>
      The unit presently is operating on air, but other gases or dopants
      could be used as well. Higher feed voltages should result in more
      energy products, per given space. Changing 5 components to other
      materials might increase output as well.<br>
      <br>
      The spinning magnetic arrays also produce some very interesting
      benefits for straightening kinked fields within the human body,
      sore muscles, and other body issues can be fixed in minutes at
      times, sometimes in seconds. Larger arrays will work for the whole
      body.<br>

      <br>
      A magnetic array with a bowl-shaped array of magnets oriented to
      induce a structured and oriented ionic flow towards a focal point.
      The magnets include a north pole and a south pole oriented to
      induce the ionic flow. Either poles face inwardly from the array
      to induce an ionic flow. Varying the size, dimensions, strength,
      and orientation of the magnets manipulates the ionic flow to a
      desired strength and velocity. The ionic flow increases in
      strength and concentration when in proximity to the narrow end.
      The ionic flow forces objects inside the array towards a hole in
      the narrow end.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One or more embodiments of the invention generally relate to
      magnets. More particularly, one or more embodiments of the
      invention relate to focusing and orienting ionic flows and
      magnetic fields.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following background information may present examples of
      specific aspects of the prior art (e.g., without limitation,
      approaches, facts, or common wisdom) that, while expected to be
      helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of
      the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present
      invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or
      implied therein or inferred thereupon.<br>
      The following is an example of a specific aspect in the prior art
      that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader
      as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed
      as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to
      anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon. By way
      of educational background, another aspect of the prior art
      generally useful to be aware of is that a magnet is a material or
      object that produces an ionic flow and a magnetic field. The ionic
      flow is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property
      of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials,
      such as iron, and attracts or repels other magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, a magnet's magnetic moment is a vector that
      characterizes the magnet's overall magnetic properties. For a bar
      magnet, the direction of the magnetic moment points from the
      magnet's south pole to its north pole.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, an ion is an atom or molecule in which the total number
      of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving
      it a net positive or negative electrical charge.<br>
      <br>
      In view of the foregoing, it is clear that these traditional
      techniques are not perfect and leave room for more optimal
      approaches.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention will now be described in detail with
      reference to embodiments thereof as illustrated in the
      accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      There are various types of magnetic arrays that may be provided by
      preferred embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment
      of the present invention, a magnetic array may include a
      bowl-shaped array of magnets oriented to induce a structured and
      oriented ionic flow. The magnets may include a north pole oriented
      to induce the ionic flow. In yet another embodiment, the magnets
      may include a south pole oriented to induce the ionic flow. Either
      of the poles may face inwardly from the array to induce the ionic
      flow. The ionic flow may flow from a wide end towards a narrow end
      of the array. In some embodiments, the ionic flow may increase in
      strength and concentration when in proximity to the narrow end of
      the array. In some embodiments, the ionic flow may force at least
      one object positioned inside the array towards an aperture
      positioned in the narrow end. However, in other embodiments, the
      ionic flow may manipulate and orients objects positioned inside
      the array for therapeutic effects and scientific studies.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the ionic flow may
      reverse direction at a point past the aperture. The at least one
      object may also reverse direction in accordance to the ionic flow.
      In this manner, the at least one object may be repulsed after
      passing through the aperture.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the present invention, the array may include
      magnets of varying sizes and strengths depending on the desired
      ionic flow and/or magnetic field to be generated. The size,
      dimension, orientation, and strength of the multiplicity of
      magnets may be manipulated to provide myriad combinations of ionic
      flow and magnetic fields. In this manner, the at least one object
      may be manipulated as desired.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 illustrates a top view of an exemplary magnetic array, in
      accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the
      present embodiment, the magnetic array 10 may include a pair of
      poles. In some embodiments, an "N" may position on one end of the
      multiplicity of magnets 12 to represent the multiplicity of north
      poles 13, and an "S" may position on the opposite end of each
      magnet to represent the multiplicity of south poles. In some
      embodiments, the magnets may include disc magnets that are
      magnetized axially with the north poles on one side of the disc
      magnet and south poles on the opposite side of the disc. The
      magnets may vary in size, shape, and magnetic density, according
      to the desired ionic flow, magnetic field, and effects produced. A
      space 14 of various dimensions may separate rows of the magnets.
      The multiplicity of magnets may include different shapes,
      including, without limitation, disk, square, triangle, circle,
      oval, rectangle, rhombus, pentagon, hexagon, polygon, sphere,
      cube, and mixed shapes.<br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, the magnets may include a bowl shaped array,
      which may orient to induce a structured and oriented ionic flow.
      The ionic flow may, in turn, induce a magnetic field having both
      direction and magnitude. The multiplicity of magnets may include
      the multiplicity of north poles oriented to induce the ionic flow.
      In yet another embodiment, the multiplicity of magnets may include
      the multiplicity of south poles oriented to induce the ionic flow.
      Either of the poles may face inwardly, towards the aperture, to
      induce an ionic flow. The ionic flow may flow from a wide end
      towards a narrow end of the array. In some embodiments, the ionic
      flow may increase in strength and concentration when in proximity
      to the narrow end of the array. In some embodiments, the ionic
      flow may force at least one object positioned inside the array
      towards an aperture positioned in the narrow end. However, in
      other embodiments, the ionic flow may manipulate and orients
      objects positioned inside the array for therapeutic effects and
      scientific studies.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art, in light of the present teachings will
      recognize that the arrays may be orderly and symmetrical, but this
      is not necessary. However, the same magnetic poles may face
      inwardly to provide the desired ionic flow through the array. In
      some embodiments, additional dimensions, including, without
      limitation, diameter, depth, base, and radius of the parabolic
      curve may vary as well as the shape, size, strength, number and
      placement of the magnets, as long as a spacing between the magnets
      is not too great so as to result in a negative effect on the
      desired field created by the array. In one embodiment, the base 16
      may be varied according to the desired effects on the ionic flow
      through the aperture. In one embodiment, when the base is smaller,
      the ionic flow is more, and therefore the velocity of the flow of
      ions may increase. In one embodiment, the diameter 19 may be
      varied according to the ionic flow, magnetic field, and desired
      effects on the at least one object. In one embodiment, increasing
      the diameter may result in an increased quantity of the ionic flow
      passing into the array if a magnetic density is increased in
      proportion to the size of the array.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art, in light of the present teachings will
      recognize that increasing the diameter and the depth of the array
      increases the magnetic strength proportionally to the size of the
      array. The ionic flow through the aperture 18 in the base may also
      increase. In one embodiment, if all the dimensions remain the
      same, yet the base becomes smaller, the velocity of the ionic flow
      may increase. In yet another embodiment, if the aperture is small,
      the ionic flow may be restricted. In one alternative embodiment,
      the aperture may not be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      Those skilled in the art, in light of the present teachings will
      recognize that magnetic fields include various classes of vortex
      waves. The vortex waves may be described with equations,
      including, without limitation, Landau-Lifshitz equation, continuum
      Heisenberg model, Ishimori equation, and nonlinear Schrödinger
      equation.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 illustrates a side view of an exemplary magnetic array with
      an exemplary arrangement and an exemplary orientation of the
      multiplicity of magnets in an exemplary array, in accordance with
      an embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment,
      the magnetic array 20 may include various sizes and dimensions. In
      some embodiments, the efficacy of the multiplicity of magnets 22
      may be affected by varying the diameter, radius 29 and the depth
      26 of the array 28 without varying the size of the aperture at a
      base of the array. A space 24 may separate the rings of magnets.
      For example, without limitation, in the present embodiment, the
      array may include an innermost ring of the multiplicity of
      magnets. However, the quantity of rings of magnets in proximity to
      the narrow end 25 may vary, while the wide end 21 may be similar.
      In yet another embodiment, the diameter and depth may vary, while
      a radius 112 of the parabolic curve of the array may be identical.
      In some embodiments, the multiplicity of magnets may include the
      multiplicity of north poles oriented to induce the ionic flow. In
      yet another embodiment, the multiplicity of magnets may include
      the multiplicity of south poles 23 oriented to induce the ionic
      flow. Either of the poles may face inwardly, towards the aperture,
      to induce an ionic flow. It should be noted that in some
      embodiments the magnets could be faced outwards, wherein given the
      present approach of using axially magnetized magnets, when one
      pole faces inwards the opposite pole faces outwards.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 illustrates an orthographic view of an exemplary magnetic
      array illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets
      in an exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the
      present invention. In the present embodiment, the array may
      include the multiplicity of magnets 32 with varying sizes and
      strengths depending on the desired ionic flow 36 to be induced.
      The size, dimension, orientation, and strength of the multiplicity
      of magnets may be manipulated to provide myriad combinations of
      ionic flow and magnetic fields. In this manner, the at least one
      object may 34 be forced towards the aperture 38 and manipulated as
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 illustrates an inverted view of an exemplary magnetic array
      illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets in an
      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, the array may include the
      multiplicity of magnets 42. The magnets may induce the ionic flow
      to flow from the wide end towards the narrow end. However, the
      ionic flow may reverse direction at a point past the aperture. The
      at least one object may also reverse direction in accordance to
      the ionic flow. In this manner, the at least one object may be
      repulsed after passing through the aperture.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 illustrates a top view of an exemplary magnetic array
      illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets in an
      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, FIG. 5 and FIG. 1 illustrate
      substantially similar magnetic arrays, yet utilize different
      dimensions for the array and the multiplicity of magnets 52. For
      example, without limitation, the innermost ring of the magnets may
      be substantially similar. Yet, the quantity of rings of magnets in
      proximity to the narrow end may vary. Therefore the diameter and
      depth of FIGS. 5 and 1 may vary, while the radius and the base 54
      of the parabolic curve of the array remain identical. The aperture
      56 and the multiplicity of north poles 58 may also be varied in
      the present embodiment.<br>

      FIG. 6 illustrates a side view of an exemplary magnetic array
      illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets in an
      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, the magnetic array may
      utilize the multiplicity of magnets 62 for performing numerous
      therapeutic and scientific functions. Those skilled in the art, in
      light of the present teachings will recognize that an organic
      object in the field of influence of the magnetic array may acquire
      properties that result in a structured and orderly cell structure.
      For example, without limitation, the use of the magnetic array for
      therapeutic treatment on humans, animals, and plants. However, the
      magnetic array may also provide other beneficial uses in the
      fields of particle physics research, energy production, and air
      cleaning. However, it is contemplated that many other applications
      produced by the magnetic array may be realized when the magnets
      are arranged in various patterns that vary the number and strength
      of the magnets. Advantageous effects may also be realized by
      varying the depth 66 and the radius 68 of the hyperbolic curve for
      the array, while at the same time varying the strength of the
      magnets and the size and shape of the magnets according to the
      ionic flow and the magnetic field desired. The multiplicity of
      south poles 64 may also be varied.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates a top view of an exemplary magnetic array
      illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets in an
      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, the dimensions and the size,
      shape, number, pattern, strength, and orientation of the
      multiplicity of north poles 76 for the multiplicity of magnets 72
      may vary greatly. For example, without limitation, the dimensions
      may be so small that the magnetic array may be microscopic. On the
      other end of the spectrum, the dimensions may be as large as
      feasible to construct. In one alternative embodiment, the magnetic
      array may be constructed so that the diameter 74 of the magnetic
      array may be measured in miles.<br>

      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, the multiplicity of magnets
      82 may be microscopic in size and have very low magnetic strength.
      Each magnet may be constructed of extremely weak magnetic material
      or of extremely strong magnetic material according to the
      properties desired of the ionic flow and the magnetic field
      produced by the magnetic array. These variable properties may be
      combined with various radiuses 84 of the hyperbolic curve, depths
      86, and variable oriented south poles 88 to produce different
      effects on the at least one object.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 illustrates a top view of an exemplary magnetic array
      illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets in an
      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, the multiplicity of magnets
      may include magnets of exactly the same size and strength. Those
      skilled in the art, in light of the present teachings will
      recognize that the difference between the arrays may be affected
      by the number of the multiplicity of magnets 92 around the
      aperture at the bottom of the array. Since the space 94 between
      the rows or rings of magnets may be similar, the size of the base
      96 of the aperture may also vary the ionic flow.<br>

      between the multiplicity of magnets 122 may be large in relation
      to the surface area of the array. The aperture 124 may position on
      a focal point of the array. However, in one alternative
      embodiment, the aperture may be oriented in proximity to the focal
      point. In another alternative embodiment, the aperture may be
      oriented in proximity to the focal point and additionally slightly
      cocked to the side.<br>

      illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets in an
      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, the multiplicity of magnets
      132 may include a greater quantity relative to the outside
      diameter of the array. The depth of the array may also be
      shallower relative to the diameter 136 of the array. In yet
      another embodiment, the aperture at the base 138 of the array may
      also be larger relative to the diameter of the array. Those
      skilled in the art, in light of the present teachings will
      recognize that varying the space 134 between the rows and rings of
      magnets may also affect the ionic flow.<br>

      illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets in an
      exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the present
      invention. In the present embodiment, the magnetic array may
      include various sizes and dimensions. In some embodiments, the
      efficacy of the multiplicity of magnets 142 may be affected by
      varying the diameter, the radius 148, the depth 146, and the space
      144 of the array without varying the size of the aperture at a
      base of the array. the depth may be shallow relative to the
      diameter of the array.<br>
      <br>

      FIG. 16 illustrates an inverted view of an exemplary magnetic
      array illustrating the arrangement of the multiplicity of magnets
      in an exemplary array, in accordance with an embodiment of the
      present invention. In the present embodiment, moving the array in
      a reciprocal motion along the axis of the magnetic array may be
      efficacious for manipulating the ionic flow and the magnetic
      field. In yet another embodiment, moving the array in a wobbling
      fashion around the axis of the magnetic array may also be helpful
      for manipulating the ionic flow and the magnetic field. In the
      present embodiment, the array may include a larger quantity of the
      multiplicity of magnets 162 compared to the outside diameter of
      the array. The depth of the array may also be shallow relative to
      the diameter of the array. In yet another embodiment, the aperture
      at the bottom of the array may be large relative to the overall
      diameter of the array.<br>

      All the features or embodiment components disclosed in this
      specification, including any accompanying abstract and drawings,
      unless expressly stated otherwise, may be replaced by alternative
      features or components serving the same, equivalent or similar
      purpose as known by those skilled in the art to achieve the same,
      equivalent, suitable, or similar results by such alternative
      feature(s) or component(s) providing a similar function by virtue
      of their having known suitable properties for the intended
      purpose. Thus, unless expressly stated otherwise, each feature
      disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent,
      or suitable, or similar features known or knowable to those
      skilled in the art without requiring undue experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      Having fully described at least one embodiment of the present
      invention, other equivalent or alternative methods of implementing
      an induced ionic flow that is oriented to focus on a focal point
      in a magnetic array for manipulating objects positioned inside the
      magnetic array according to the present invention will be apparent
      to those skilled in the art. Various aspects of the invention have
      been described above by way of illustration, and the specific
      embodiments disclosed are not intended to limit the invention to
      the particular forms disclosed. The particular implementation of
      the induced ionic flow that is oriented to focus on a focal point
      in a magnetic array for manipulating objects positioned inside the

      magnetic array for manipulating objects positioned inside the
      magnetic array described in the foregoing were principally
      directed to a bowl shaped magnetic array that induced an ionic
      flow oriented to focus on a focal point in the magnetic array for
      manipulating objects positioned inside the magnetic array
      implementations; however, similar techniques may instead be
      applied to controlling ferromagnetic materials in nanomaterials
      and microscopic spaces, which implementations of the present
      invention are contemplated as within the scope of the present
      invention. The invention is thus to cover all modifications,
      equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope
      of the following claims. It is to be further understood that not
      all of the disclosed embodiments in the foregoing specification
