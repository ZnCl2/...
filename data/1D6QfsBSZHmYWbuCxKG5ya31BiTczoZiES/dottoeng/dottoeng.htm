        <p><b><font size="+1">400 HP from an 36 Kg engine !</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;”So far, nobody can declare that the Rotary Engine could
        substitute the traditional combustion engine, but everybody
        knows that latter is undoubtly exceeded by the Rotary Engine at
        least in the matter of engine variants, designed and even made
        in the last decades. </p>
      <p>Here is one more interesting variant of Rotary Engine, which
        constitutes an real record in this matter, with an specific
        power of min.11 HP / Kg, given about 2,5 HP / Kg as the medium
        amount of the classic combustion engine. We are talking about
        the invention of G. A. Dotto and W. L. Linn; they have
        eccentrically installed into an elliptical chamber, a
        rotor-device which forms 16 partitions, using also 16 dividing
        mobile walls. Because of the eccentricity of the rotor during
        its rotational movement, the volume of the active chambers is
        variable. The position of the dividing walls – which must remain
        permanently in contact with the inner surface of the body – is
        very precisely stabilized by a cam which is mounted inside the
        rotor, in the middle of the rotor shaft. </p>
      <p>The engine supply with air and oil is made by pping inside the
        stator. The mixture air / oil at low pressure is sent by an
        axial blower which is mounted on the shaft. After the mixture
        in-take, the volume of the combustion chamber gradually
        decreases, than the pressure reached the <br>
        maximum amount and the mixture is ignited and it burns
        simultaneous with the combustion chamber enlargement during the
        gases expansion. The moment choosen for ignition is unusual,
        compred to regular combustion engines, which make the ingnition
        before the mixture reaches the maximum pressure. In a very short
        time after the ignition, the combustion gases are exhausted
        through the stator wall. That engine seemes to be perfect for
        the applications which require big diriving : automobiles,
        helicopters, ships and aircrafts. The inventors have specified
        that their Rotary Engine could develop 200 HP having just 20
        centimeters in diameter. </p>
      <p>This kind of rotary engine could be mounted directly on the
        propeller axle of the aircraft, or of the helicopter or ship, or
        even on the actuating axle of the automobile – however, that
        last application is unlikely. In the future, the inventors want
        to improve their engine by using the “diesel” combustion (
        without igniters) with two parallel rotors,- the first rotor
        supplys the second rotor with compressed air and the second
        rotor become the real driving unit of the engine. </p>
      <p>Well, the inventors want to make this improvement because the
        first variant of their rotary engine- although develops an
        record power at 5000 round/min and could work even at 18.000
        round/min – under 1000 round/min, its driving-couple is almost
        nill.” </p>
      <p><i>Captions:</i> </p>
      <p>“ The rotor of the new engine has this complicated design, with
        numerous oriffices for the sealing gaskets, for the mixture
        turbulence and also cuttings for the dividing wall. (a) </p>
      <p>That rotor is eccentrically mounted into an light body which
        has a elliptical inner surface ; the stator walls are endowed
        with pipes for supply and exhaust and with the igniters. (b) </p>
      <p>After the assembling, the engine is cylindrical and compact and
        we can see the igniter wire, the supply axial blower and the
        exhaust pipe (c).” </p>

      <p>The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine,
        more particularly to a rotary internal combustion engine. The
        rotary internal combustion engine includes several novel means
        and methods such as continuous firing of an explosive fuel and
        air mixture in an explosion space thereby eliminating the need
        for a continuous spark or a continuous ignition system, vanes
        that ride in close proximity to an inner periphery of a
        cylinder, notched configurations in a rotor’s periphery and
        slotted portions formed in the inner periphery of the cylinder
        to obtain a more advantageous mixture of fuel and air,
        combustion of the fuel and air mixture in a decompression
        portion of a firing cycle to thereby obtain a cooler running
        engine without sacrifice of horsepower developed by the novel
        rotary internal combustion engine, and a ring means or a camming
        surface and bearing cooperatively associated with each
        individual vane to predeterminately locate the vane with respect
        to the inner wall of the cylinder to thereby substantially
        reduce wear. </p>
      <p>Rotary internal combustion engines are known and are
        successfully utilized to provide a driving means for tools,
        machines, and any other types of machinery that demand a uniform
        and a constant output of energy in order to be efficiently
        actuated. The rotary internal combustion engine may be utilized
        as a means for propelling automotive means and would necessarily
        be equipped with a suitable transmission. Within the broad field
        of rotary internal engines, the need exists for a light weight
        engine that is cooler running than is the conventional rotary
        internal combustion engine; the need exists for an internal
        combustion engine that eliminates the need for a means that
        develops a continuous ignition spark; and the need exists
        whereby the internal wear of the rotary internal combustion
        engine is substantially reduced thereby promoting greater engine
        efficiency and longer engine life. </p>
      <p>Several presently available rotary internal combustion engines
        include vane means that engage with the cylinder wall thereby
        increasing wear at the point or points of engagement. Typically,
        these engines include a continuous spark ignition system for
        each pair of vanes substantially seal their associated portion
        of a circular cylinder. Several of the presently available
        rotary internal combustion engines ignite the fuel and air
        mixture during the compression portion of the cycle whereas the
        present invention provides a means for igniting the fuel and air
        mixture during the decompression portion of the cycle thereby
        allowing the engine of the present invention to operate at a
        substantially cooler temperature without any substantial
        sacrifice in power developed by the engine. It is seen that the
        present invention provides a simple, effective, and efficient
        rotary internal combustion engine. By the accompanying drawings
        and specification, the novel means and method whereby the
        present invention fulfills the required purposes will be
        disclosed. </p>
