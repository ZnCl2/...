      <p>The story of Alfred Hubbard and his coil in the July 1956 issue
        of <i>Fate</i> made me recall another mysterious device. Around
        1920 John Huston of Prineville, Ore., claimed to have invented a
        way to take heat out of the air with condensers. The first
        poorly insulated rig of his that I saw boiled water in 20
        minutes. The device was claimed to replace fuels, to be good for
        household heating or refrigeration and to be able to run
        railroad engines or steamboats. </p>
      <p>Huston and his father formed a company of 20 stockholders and
        Huston built an up-to-date model of his device. This model
        performed better than expected, and Huston and his father took
        it to San Francisco to demonstrate it. They hoped to interest
        manufacturers in building the device on a royalty basis. </p>
      <p>I talked to Huston after he returned to Prineville. He told me,
        "The machine can be made so hot that it will destroy itself.
        Reverse the machine, and the temperature will go as low as 250
        below zero." </p>
      <p>He said manufacturers in San Francisco refused to build the
        machine because it would throw too many men out of work. It
        would also kill the sale of fuels, the major cargo of steamships
        at that time. </p>
      <p>Huston also told me he had patented his device in Canada and
        England. The USA had refused to patent it. </p>
      <p>Huston evidently got nowhere with his device and I do not know
        what became of it. He died a young man of 22 in 1920 or 1921. </p>

      </center>
      <p>"The Hubbard Energy Transformer" brought back to me exciting
        memories of another inventor. In 1918, while doing painting and
        decorating, I was hired to paper several bedrooms in a large
        two-story house. While at this work I went down to the back
        porch to pick up some materials. I happened to glance at the
        light meter and saw it was not moving. </p>
      <p>I opened the fuse box and saw the main power fuses had been
        removed. It took only a minute to make sure the line had not
        been taped beyond the meter. </p>
      <p>The only member of the family at home at the time was a young
        man in his early twenties [C. Earl Ammann]. I asked him, "Earl,
        where do you get your juice? I noticed it does not come from the
        power lines". </p>
      <p>"Come along and I’ll show you", he said. He led me up to the
        attic. He placed some steel bars on a work table and picked up a
        coil which looked like a loose coupler. After placing the coils
        on the steel rods he touched the opposite terminal. The bell
        rang with great force, and there was quite a spark, too. </p>
      <p>I picked up the coils to make sure there was no contact with
        other appliances. I could see right through them. There was no
        battery inside. The bell rang just as vigorously. The wire was
        iron. </p>
      <p>In the basement Earl had what he called an Activator
        Transformer, the size of two fists, which had to be within 10
        miles of the radius of the generator coils. The activator was
        not in contact with any visible wires or appliances. It was
        activated by the electric currents which surge around the earth
        and activate the compass needle. By cutting into these currents,
        earl said, we can obtain unlimited power. </p>
      <p>A year later Earl demonstrated his Cosmo Electric Generator in
        Denver. He had placed two copper spheres on the front fenders of
        his car in pace of the headlights. From these copper spheres he
        obtained enough power to drive that old jalopy all over Denver
        as reported in the Denver Post at the time. </p>
      <p>While Earl was demonstrating his invention all over the streets
        of Denver, the power had been cut off in the foothills. In spite
        of this, when he went to Washington DC shortly afterward to try
        to obtain a patent on his Cosmo Electric Generator, he found
        that charges had been filed against him claiming he had a device
        to steal power from the power lines. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Denver Man Invents Generator That Takes
              Electricity From Air &amp; Propels Automobile</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Believes He has Apparatus that will Revolutionize Power
          &amp; Lighting &amp; Gives it a Test on Streets of City</i> </p>
      <p>Has an invention been made that will revolutionize the
        electrical world? Will the apparatus conceived by a Denver man
        light buildings, run automobiles, battleships, power plants by
        the unlimited supply of electricity in the air? Denver
        electrical experts say "yes", and the young inventor, C. Earl
        Ammann, Monday demonstrated his invention by attaching it to an
        old automobile and running it about the city. </p>
      <p>An atmospheric generator is the name of Ammann’s apparatus. It
        is a compact, cylindrical object with two small brass spheres
        protruding from the top. Inside, Ammann says, is an arrangement
        of steel wires and minerals, so fixed as to draw the electricity
        from the air, condense it and utilize it for driving power. </p>
      <p>The automobile which Ammann used for his demonstration Monday
        was the body and chassis of an electric vehicle. There are said
        to be no batteries in the car. It propelled itself with
        remarkable speed at the touch of the foot, climbed hills and
        glided through a maze of traffic under easy control. </p>
      <p><i>Careful To Conceal His Invention ~</i> </p>
      <p>When asked by skeptical persons if he had a storage battery
        concealed inside of the power cylinder, Ammann said: </p>
      <p>"As badly as I would like to show the inside of my invention, I
        can’t, for I have not yet obtained the patent rights. It would
        be exposing the result of seven years of work to open the
        cylinder. I leave for Washington this week to obtain the patent
        rights. When I return I will gladly show everything and I can
        only say, wait until then and time will tell. </p>
      <p>"I have bucked every law of the textbooks to perfect the
        invention. It appears on the order of the wireless telephone but
        it is decidedly different, except that the electricity is
        derived from the air. It will run anywhere except under water. </p>
      <p>The automobile is only a simple test. The generator will light
        buildings, do away with steam turbines, and, in fact, propel any
        kind of engine motor". </p>
      <p>J. N. Davis, the proprietor of the Davis Electric Garage
        company, at 921 East 14th Avenue, and one of the oldest
        electrical men in Denver, made a thorough study of the
        generator. </p>
      <p><i>Electrical Man Has Faith In It ~</i> </p>
      <p>"I believe that Mr. Ammann has at least made the invention
        which will revolutionize power", Mr. Davis said. "Of course, we
        don’t know what is inside of the generator and the inventor
        would be foolish to show us. We have long known that certain
        minerals exist, which if properly arranged together, would
        furnish power. That, in substance, according to the blueprints
        of the invention, is the basis of the whole thing. </p>
      <p>"If the generator has been perfected to the extent that it will
        propel an automobile, the rest of its work is assured. It will
        be the greatest invention of the age. The electricity obtained
        from the air, first passing through the generator, would be
        available for any use". So impressed was Mr. Davis that he
        offered the use of his building for Mr. Ammann’s headquarters.
        Ammann, who is but 28 years old, came to Denver from Spokane,
        Washington. He is an electrical engineer and lives at the
        Argonaut Hotel. </p>

          Thinks It’s Important ~ Built On A Radio Principle ~ Armature
          Winding New -- Invention Inspired By Young Son -- Lindbergh
          Flies Here</i> </p>
      <p>Detroit, Mich, Feb. 25 -- W.B. Stout, head of the Stout Air
        Lines and designer of the all-metal tri-motored Ford Monoplane,
        declared here today that he had seen what he characterized as an
        "impressive" demonstration of the Hendershot fuelless motor two
        weeks ago in Pittsburgh. </p>
      <p>Lester J. Hendershot, the inventor, and his associate. D. Barr
        Peat, who is manager of the Bettis Field at McKeesport,
        demonstrated the motor secretly yesterday in a hangar at
        Selfridge Field. This block test was witnessed by Major Thomas
        G. Lanspier, Clonel Charles A. Lindbergh and others. </p>
      <p>It was explained today that the model used in the demonstration
        was a much smaller machine than an actual working motor capable
        of developing enough power to lift and propel an airplane. Its
        designers claim for it that it runs on an electromagnetic
        principle, bywhich it draws its force directly from the earth’s
        field, and through the properties within the motor itself
        transforms these electric currents into power tha can be
        delivered efficiently at a propeller shaft. </p>
      <p><i>Calls Demonstration Uncanny ~</i> </p>
      <p>"The demonstration was very impressive", Mr. Stout said. "It
        was actually uncanny. I would like very much to see how a large
        model designed to develop power enough to lift an airplane would
        operate". </p>
      <p>Mr. Stout said the model he saw was about the size of the tiny
        motors used in vacuum cleaners. </p>
      <p>"I was told that the revolutionary feature was a hereto unknown
        manner of winding the armature", Mr. Stout continued.
        "Hendershot said he had succeeded in winding it in such a way
        that it draws energy directly from electrical currents which
        exist constantly in the air or in the ground. Such sources of
        cheap and inexhaustible power, of course, never have been
        reached before. The small model appeared to operate exactly as
        Hendershot explained that it did". </p>
      <p>Neither Colonel Lindbergh nor Major Lanphier would express
        themselves at length on the test they witnessed yesterday. Major
        Lanphier admitted, however, that they were experimenting with it
        and referred all questions to Hendershot. </p>
      <p>"He is the only one who knows all about it", the Major said.
        "Lindbergh has nothing to do with it, although he saw it". </p>
      <p>William B. Mayo, chief engineer for the Ford Motor Company, was
        in conference with Major Lanphier, Hendershot and Peat at Major
        Lanphier’s quarters today. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">"Invention Result Of Dream"</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><i>Hendershot Made First Fuelless Motor For His Son’s Toy Plane
          ~</i> </p>
      <p>The invention of the fuelless motor, tested at Detroit, was the
        result of a dream by its inventor, Lester Jennings Hendershot,
        who lives on "the street back of the railroad" in this town of
        about 3,000 inhabitants, 15 miles from Pittsburgh. </p>
      <p>Although Hendershot was on his way from Selfridge Field today
        and is not expected home until tomorrow, his wife told of his
        conception of the machine and how the miniature model was
        constructed from the parts of a worn out radio which had been
        given to the inventor by his uncle. </p>
      <p>Several years ago the vision of a machine which would operate
        from "earth currents" came to Hendershot in a dream, according
        to his wife, but it was not until last November that he actually
        started working on it. </p>
      <p>His 4-year old boy had built a small airplane at that time and
        was considerably chagrined because it would not operate. The
        father was disturbed too, so he told his son he would build an
        airplane which would work. The result of that was the fuelless
        machine. </p>
      <p><i>First Model Worked Toy Plane ~</i> </p>
      <p>When the miniature motor model had been constructed, Hendershot
        built a small airplane and placed the machine in it. A switch
        was turned and immediately the propeller began to move. The
        machie was not connected to any electrical current, but was
        running on is own accord from "earth currents". </p>
      <p>For several weeks the little motor and the airplane rested upon
        a small table in the living room of the Hendershot home, which
        faces an unpaved street near the railroad tracks. One day D.
        Barr Peat of Bettis Field, the air mail port near McKeesport,
        Pa., visited the Hendershot home to see the model. </p>
      <p>He immediately became enthusiastic and a few weeks later he and
        Hendershot were at Selfridge Field where permission was been
        granted to build a model large enough to operate an airplane. </p>
      <p>Hendershot, who is only 29 years old, was born in Hyndmann, Pa.
        His schooling has not been extensive, although he spent a few
        months several years ago at Cornell University, where he took a
        few courses in mechanics. He has not been employed at any
        particular task and has been known as a "freelance" worker. He
        has been a fireman and an engineer on the railroad, has worked
        in the mills near Pittsburgh, has inspected concrete and done
        electrical work. During the war he was a bugler with a machine
        gun company, but did not get overseas. </p>
      <p><i>Still Wants To See "How They Work" ~</i> </p>
      <p>According to his mother, he has always been interested in
        mechanics and when a child he would insist upon taking his
        playthings apart. </p>
      <p>And that desire has not escaped him a man, for even now he
        takes his own son’s playthings apart to "see how they work". </p>
      <p>It required only a few weeks for him to construct the miniature
        model of his fuelless motor, although he worked day and night
        during that time. He had a crude workbench in the cellar of his
        home, which was placed near the furnace, where it was warm.
        Early in the morning he would be there, tinkering about, and
        late at night he still could be found there. </p>
      <p>Hendershot’s idea was that the earth currents which make the
        aurora borealis in the skies could be harnessed by man and made
        to produce power that would operate an engine. </p>
      <p>The youthful inventor has no other inventions to his credit. </p>

        <hr width="61%">
        <p><b><font size="+1">"Works On Principle Of Compass"</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Lester J. Hendershot first came to Bettis airplane field in
        McKeesport between two and three years ago, and soon afterward
        brought one of his motor models to the officers of the field for
        inspection. </p>
      <p>The fuelless motor works somewhat on the principle of a
        compass, and the original model would always operate when
        pointing north or south, as does the compass, but would not move
        when pointed east or west. </p>
      <p>Young Hendershot worked nearly two years to overcome this
        defect, and finally he brought a motor to the Bettis field that
        appeared to be working perfectly. This motor was installed in a
        small model airplane and the plane flew, but owing to the
        failure to rig it properly, it crashed to the ground during on
        of the experiments. </p>
      <p>Constantly improving the motor, Hendershot finally interested
        D. Barr Peat, manager of the Bettis Field, in his invention. </p>
      <p>After a short time several capitalist were interested, and a
        few weeks ago the motor was taken to Detroit by Hendershot and
        Peat for an exhibition. </p>
      <p>While no person at the field was in position to say
        authoritatively, it was stated that the capitalists who become
        interested in the Hendershot motor have about completed their
        arrangements for the purchase of the invention, or for
        controlling its production. </p>
      <p>The fuelless motor, it is said, appears to have tremendous
        power and easily made between 1500 and 2000 revolutions per
        minute on several occasions while being tested at the field.
        Pilots and mechanics believe it to be the greatest invention of
        the age, and all appear sure it will be a practical success as
        an airship motor. </p>
      <p>It was stated at the field that the inspection of the motor by
        Colonel Lindbergh was made in the interests of the capitalists
        who were arranging to purchase the invention. </p>

      </center>
      <p>The Hendershot "Fuelless motor" is not a motor at all but a
        generator, according to Major Thomas G. lanphier, commandant at
        Selfridge Field, Mich., where he with Lester J. Hendershot, the
        inventor, and D. Barr Peat, have been quietly working on an
        experimental model. </p>
      <p>Major Lanphier said he first became interested in the
        Hendershot electrical machine several weeks ago through Peat;
        that in common with others he thought at first it was more or
        less "bunk" but after seeing it work he became interested. </p>
      <p>"I saw the first model which Hendershot built hooked up to a
        small electric motor of the type used to operate a sewing
        machine. It not only ran the motor but it burned it out", Major
        Lanphier said. </p>
      <p>Why this generator acts as it does, where the energy comes from
        that transforms it into power, Major Lanphier was not prepared
        to say beyond quoting Hendershot. It is the inventor’s theory
        that his machine draws its energy from the earth’s magnetic
        field. While unwilling to describe it in detail until pending
        patents have been received, Major Lanphier told a little about
        it. The first model consisted of a ring magnet less than three
        inches in diameter. Around the magnet were coils rigged as only
        Hendershot knows how to rig them, and another set of coils pass
        through the center of the ring. </p>
      <p>"With this contrivance we burned out the sewing machine motor
        and we also kept a 6 watt lamp going with it for 26 hours", he
        said. </p>
      <p>The larger model which has not yet been hooked to a motor that
        will deliver power to a crankshaft, Major Lanphier himself
        helped build. </p>
      <p>"We put it together out of stuff we picked up at the field and
        with it we lighted two 110 watt lamps", Major Lanphier said. "I
        think that we have got enough electricity in this second model
        to kill a man". </p>
      <p>The second model is built around a ring magnet, the outside
        diameter of which is seven inches and the inside diameter six
        inches. </p>
      <p>It was suggested that perhaps the Hendershot engine was
        "stealing" power from some big radio broadcasting station. </p>
      <p>"We thought of that", Lanphier said, "but we ran it for 26
        hours when stations were going and when they were not and we got
        the same results". </p>

      <p><i>M. C. Kelly to Ask Five Scientists to Test Hendershot Device</i>
      </p>
      <p>Representative M. Clyde Kelly of Pennsylvania, it became known
        here today, plans to seek a Congressional patent for the
        "fuelless" motor of Lester J. Hendershot of West Elizabeth, Pa.,
        if five scientists approve the invention as practical. A
        Congressional patent gives the patentee full protection for 17
        years. </p>
      <p>Hendershot’s invention, which he describes as a "magnetic
        induction" motor, was first announced in March. At that time in
        some quarters it was regarded with skepticism. </p>
      <p>The motor, according to its inventor, is without visible means
        of power. It obtains its initial impulse, Hendershot maintains,
        from a precharged magnetic core, and its secondary and greatest
        power impulse by magnetic induction from the earth. </p>
      <p>Hendershot today said several of his motors had been built
        here, and that one, which developed 60 horsepower, had been in
        operation for two weeks without recharging the magnetic core. </p>

      <p><i>Hendershot Says Shifting Its Field To east And West Causes
          Rotary Motion ~ Winding Of Magnet Secret ~</i> <br>
        <i>Inventor Asserts Engine Weighs But 4 Ounces Per Horsepower</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mildly indignant because the manner in which his fuelless motor
        gains its power had been misrepresented in dispatches from
        Detroit and Washington, Lester J. Hendershot today stated there
        was nothing mysterious about his motor, that the force that
        energizes it is the "same force that pulls the needle of the
        compass, and there is nothing mysterious about that". </p>
      <p>The fuelless motor was not his objective, he explained, at the
        time he began his experiments some three years ago, when he
        first became interested in aviation. </p>
      <p>"I soon learned that the ultimate development o aviation
        depended upon the discovery or invention of an absolutely true
        and reliable compass", he explained. "The ordinary magnetic
        compass does not point to the true north -- it points to the
        magnetic north, and varies from the true north to a different
        extent at almost every point on the earth’s surface. </p>
      <p>"There is another compass, the magnetic induction compass, that
        indicates true north. But it must be set before each flight, and
        is not always reliable. </p>
      <p>"I found that with a pre-magnetized core I could set up a
        magnetic field that would indicate true north, but I didn’t know
        just how to utilize that in the compass I set out to find. </p>
      <p>"In continuing my experiments, I learned that by cutting the
        same line of magnetic force north and south, I had an indicator
        of the true north, and that by cutting the magnetic field east
        and west, I could develop a rotary motion. </p>
      <p>I now have a motor built on that principle that will rotate at
        a constant speed, a speed predetermined when the motor is built.
        It can be built for any desired speed, and a reliable constant
        speed motor is one of the greatest needs of aviation. </p>
      <p>The main secret of Mr. Hendershot’s invention, his Friend Barr
        Peat declares, is the method of winding a magnet in the motor so
        that it will rotate in the opposite direction than the earth
        revolves. He says there is no heat, because magnetic forces are
        cold and the motor is stopped only by breaking the magnetic
        field in the windings. The magnet in the motor, he thinks,
        probably would have to be recharged after about 2000 hours of
        operation. </p>
      <p>Mr. Hendershot declares that one of his motors, complete and
        ready to be installed in an airplane would weigh little more
        than four ounces for every horsepower it developed, while the
        best of the gas engines now built weighs about two pounds per
        horsepower. </p>
      <p>Mr. Hendershot says that altitude would not affect the
        efficient operation of his motor, for the magnetic influence of
        the earth has been found to remain the same as high as man has
        ever reached. </p>
      <p>He said that the same principle which made his original model
        operate only when it was placed in one direction, north and
        south, will be developed so that it will provide a compass that
        will always indicate true north. </p>

      <i>Jesuit Inventor From Brazil Is Here To market Product, Now
        Undergoing Patent Tests ~ Not A Fuelless Machine ~
        "Inter-Atomic" Force Increases Electric Battery power, He Says
        -- Discounts Hendershot Claims</i>
      <p>An Italian Jesuit priest from Brazil announced here yesterday
        that he had invented a motor that makes use of "interatomic"
        energy to generate many times the power it receives originally
        from an electric battery. The motor is now at Washington, where
        it is undergoing the Patent Office investigation. </p>
      <p>The priest is the Rev. Antonio d’Angelo, S.J., a stocky,
        earnest little man who combines missionary work in Brazil with
        tinkering in his own electrical laboratory. He speaks no
        English, but told of his machine through his brother, Biagio
        d’Angelo of 1475 LeLand Ave., the Bronx. </p>
      <p>Father d’Angelo became interested in electricity 20 years ago
        when he was a student at a Jesuit seminary in Naples. A year and
        a half ago he was sent out by his Order to Brazil to carry on
        missionary work at Ribeirao Preto among the Italian emigrants.
        He had to get a special dispensation from Bishop Alberto
        Gonzales of Ribeirao Preto to visit the United States where, so
        his brother had written him, fortune comes more easily to the
        man with a money-saving device. He came here in November 1927,
        and has urged his Bishop to extend his leave of six months. </p>
      <p>The missionary priest does not believe in the Hendershot
        "fuelless motor". </p>
      <p>"I challenge anyone", he said yesterday, "to use the magnetic
        field of the earth for running a motor. The energy from that
        would be too small". </p>
      <p>His motor, he said, could be used in the home to supply
        electric lighting cheaply, and even heating. He said that it
        could be used to run trains, airplanes and automobiles. </p>
      <p>Father d’Angelo had a plan of his motor with him yesterday. He
        showed how it started to develop energy from an electric
        battery, and how this original impulse worked on the machine to
        generate many time its power through the "electricity produced
        by the inter-atomic energy of the ions". </p>
