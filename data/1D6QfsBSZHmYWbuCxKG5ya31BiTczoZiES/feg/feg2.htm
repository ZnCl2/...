              Dream Alive"</font></b> </p>
        <p>Skeptics scoff but inventor sure it works </p>
        <p>by <b>Christine Rook</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the 13th century, Villard de Honnecourt, a French architect
        designed a weighted wheel that was to turn forever without the
        benefit of an external power source. The concept was sure to
        change the world, but it never worked, and neither has any
        perpetual motion machine that followed. </p>
      <p>Now, an Irondequoit man believes he has invented a motor that
        actually does run indefinitely and with no outside power source.
        Scientists are skeptical. They stand behind the laws of
        thermodynamics, but a t least one person said he has seen it
        work. </p>
      <p>Lajos "Louie" Szucs, a Hungarian-born auto repairman, has
        invented what he calls a magnetic field motor. He said it is
        powerful enough to drive a heater and warm most of his two-story
        home. Its source of start is a single jump-start from a 12-volt
        car battery. That one-time jolt supposedly powered it for 60
        days. </p>
      <p>"It doesn't matter whether I got a high school education. You
        got to use your mind", he said in broken English at his home on
        St. Paul Blvd. "If Newton thought we fly to the moon, he would
        drop dead right here." </p>
      <p>Few people, however, have seen how the motor works. It wasn't
        operating last week. He had taken it apart and hidden the pieces
        in his house. He fears someone will steal his idea because only
        the heater attachments that hook to the motor have patent
        pending status with the US Government Patent &amp; Trademark
        Office in Arlington VA. </p>
      <p>The motor, however, does not have patent pending status and
        could be claimed by someone else. Szucs, therefore, is cryptic
        when he talks about the motor. He has barely given the details
        to his financial backer and partner, Ronald A. Englert. And a
        handful of trusted friends have sealed envelopes, containing
        partial blueprints. If something were to happen to Szucs, the
        envelopes get sent to specific destinations. </p>
      <p>It's all cloak-and-dagger and probably the result of his losing
        one of his earliest inventions to a stranger for $15. Szucs had
        developed a set of special automobile tools when he first came
        to the United States in 1956. Szucs naively handed over the
        rights. </p>
      <p>"He thanks me for making him rich", Szucs said. </p>
      <p>He was just a teenager then but willing to work hard and bounce
        back. He and his wife, Magdalan, had left Communist Hungary for
        a better life. </p>
      <p>They settled in Glens Falls, Warren County, because a church
        there had sponsored their transport. But they remained just six
        months. Neither of them spoke English and job opportunities were
        scarce. They agreed to get on a bus and get out at the first
        large city. That was Rochester. </p>
      <p>"It was a tough time for the first 5 or 10 years", Szucs said.
        "Very few people helped us." </p>
      <p>But the Budapest native earned a good reputation as an auto
        body repariman. </p>
      <p>Englert, who said he has witnessed the perpetual motion machine
        work, stands behind Szucs and his inventions -- the
        magnetic-driven toys that Szucs developed for his son, Lajos Jr,
        an air compressor, and a car wax. </p>
      <p>Szucs has since decided to follow his dream full time and leave
        the auto repair business. He breathes and sleeps inventions.
        Some, like the perpetual motion machine, have actually come to
        him in dreams. </p>
      <p>"I see the universe. It's like blueprints, a puzzle", Szucs
        said. "When I get up in the morning, it's all there." </p>
      <p>His motor seems simple enough. A car battery puts a triangular
        driving shaft in motion and is then removed. The spinning shaft
        then runs a heater. Szucs said he has reduced his home heating
        bills from $300 to $400 a month to $45 or less per month. </p>
      <p>Szucs, a high school graduate, doesn't claim to understand
        everything about physics. He only knows that his machine works.
      </p>
      <p>What he finds difficult to accept is the cold reception that
        scientists have given him. Most believe a perpetual motion
        machine is impossible. </p>
      <p>"The likelihood? Zero", says Robert Snyder, a professor of
        mechanical engineering at Rochester Institute of Technology. "It
        violates the laws of thermodynamics." </p>
      <p>Physics professor Ronald Jodoin, also of RIT, added: "I would
        be skeptical." </p>
      <p>In reality, Szucs may not have a perpetual motion machine. He
        may simply have an extra-efficient motor. In fact, Szucs'
        lawyer, Howard J. Greenwald indicated Szucs may not make and
        perpetual motion claims in his patent application. </p>
      <p>Szucs refuses to give up on his machine. </p>
      <p>"I can't take failure. This is failure if someone tells you it
        doesn't work." </p>

              amplify energy from mystery source"</font></b> <br>
          (Unidentified source, early 1980s)</p>
      </center>
      <p>A Connecticut research company, Xtec Inc of New Britain, has
        announced the development of an invention that is claimed to
        have demonstrated the ability to amplify energy from
        conventional sources by using a specially-designed antenna to
        gather external power from the environment. </p>
      <p>According to an independent consultant who has reviewed the
        Xtech research to date: " What has been witnessed appears to be
        an energy absorption effect with the capability of tapping
        energy from an as yet unidentified outside source to do the
        required work. Proper understanding and useful application of
        this device will require more precise and quantitative
        investigation and experimentation." </p>
      <p>Xtec describes its "energy amplifier" as a relatively simple
        device which extracts energy from the environment and utilizes
        it to supplement or amplify the power from an independent power
        supply such as a battery. "It uses a specially-designed antenna
        to gather this external power, which has been successfully
        applied in laboratory tests to power a metal-cutting lathe and
        an industrial tricycle." A patent application has been filed
        with the US Patent Office, and additional patent coverage is in
        preparation for all major industrial nations on a worldwide
        basis. </p>
      <p>Extec [sic] says that utilizing an antenna to draw in or
        amplify power is well known, and quotes US Patent&nbsp; #
        2,813,242 [L.R. Crump: Powering Electrical Devices with Energy
        Abstracted from the Atmosphere]&nbsp; as demonstrating that
        energy can be extracted from the atmosphere through a properly
        designed antenna to provide useful power. Also that this patent
        shows that electromagnetic energy was captured in sufficient
        quantities to drive a transistor circuit. </p>
      <p>In the Xtec device an antenna operates as an dependent power
        supply for the system. An input signal turns on the power
        amplifying antenna which draws on the potential between two
        points in the environment to complete a circuit through a form
        of inductive coupling. The result is amplified energy for the
        load to be driven. It has been postulated that the energy being
        tapped exists between the antenna and either low frequency
        ground currents, or an external pulsing magnetic field. This has
        yet to be proven, and Xtec has initiated a full-scale research
        program to investigate the phenomenon. </p>
      <p>Xtec says that tests of this previously unknown principle were
        not intended to prove theories underlying the energy amplifier
        in a controlled, rigorously scientific manner, but that they do
        demonstrate a definite energy enhancement as well as the ability
        to recharge the batteries being used as the independent power
        supply to drive the energy amplifier. </p>
      <p>The ongoing research program seeks to define this phenomenon
        further and to indicate direction for practical commercial
        development of the enhanced energy which the amplifier produces.

      </center>
      <p>The Solid State K-capture Generator is a computer controlled
        system that utilizes the "K-Capture" principle to create
        electrical energy. </p>
      <p>K-capture has been known to give off tremendous amounts of
        energy but no one had discovered away to control the energy. The
        K-capture Generator does this and may prove to be one of the
        greatest source of energy discovered. </p>
      <p>Unshielded, it does emit x-ray particles. </p>
      <p>The prototype models (for manufacturing) were expected to
        produce a constant electrical current of at least 50kw and was
        predicted to handle surges and heavier loads of over 200kw for
        one to two hours before it heated up to a temperature that would
        automatically shut the power off. If this were to occur, there
        would be no harm sustained by the unit, but would have to be
        restarted when the unit's temperature lowers to approximately 60
        F. </p>
      <p>Most American homes average 5 to 7 kw per day. However, a 100%
        electrically powered house could have peak usage of up to 35kw.
        With normal power usage, 50kw could handle from three to ten
        homes, depending on size and peak demand. Very few small
        commercial operations would ever require more than 50kw to
        supply their needs, if more power is required an additional unit
        or units could be added. Each one would operate as a standby
        unit and supply the required power without losing power as each
        one began its operation. </p>
      <p>One unit measures approximately 2' x 2' x 6' but can also be
        made smaller by using a different configuration when fitting the
        component parts together. </p>
      <p>On a standard basis, the unit normally supplies 5kw of AC power
        and 45kw of DC power. This can be altered by the use of external
        inverters, transformers, etc. </p>
      <p>It is estimated that under normal conditions that the fuel used
        will last over one million years. However, since it does use
        other non-moving components, it is expected to have malfunctions
        in such things as computer controls, diodes, capacitors, etc.
        When this occurs replacement would be required and the unit
        would have to be restarted. <br>
        Starting the unit requires 120 volts and 400 watts [@3.33 amps].
        The power available is on an "as needed" basis and if all power
        was shut-off, there would be no harm to the unit. </p>
      <p>The theory herein described is used as a power source by
        creating a radionuclide by K-capture. </p>
      <p>The process to reach this goal is initiated by producing a high
        intensity ultra-violet burst to cause an irregular condition
        where the K electrons in lithium isotope-6, creates a condition
        where K-capture is possible. <br>
        The ultra-violet burst is produced with a nitrogen laser. It has
        been known for some time that a high voltage discharge and high
        current electric discharge in nitrogen gas will generate a pulse
        of coherent radiation at 3,371 angstroms. The laser action
        encounters an electron moving in the discharge, absorbing its
        energy. The encounter leaves the molecule in an unstable state.
        It usually falls to a state of lower energy by emitting a photon
        at 3,371 angstroms. </p>
      <p>The photon may encounter other excited molecules causing them
        to emit their energy in lock step with the encountering photon.
        The resulting pulse of radiation has twice the energy of each
        photon. This is laser action. <br>
        The process continues as long as there are excited molecules
        along the path. The process soon stops because when a large
        number of molecules are excited, they wil1 begin to cascade at
        random to lower states of energy. <br>
        The numbers of molecules at lower 1evels build up rapidly,
        eventually exceeding those at upper levels and terminating the
        amplification. </p>
      <p>The laser quickly turns itself off even though there are
        excited molecules left behind. The turn off time is fast,
        usually less than ten-nanoseconds. </p>
      <p>Inducing laser action in nitrogen is dependent on constructing
        a mechanism that will instantaneously send a huge current of
        electrons at high voltage laterally through a column of the gas
        at a pressure of about 100 torr. <br>
        An appropriate switching mechanism that can handle tens of
        thousands of amperes within nanoseconds turns out to be quite
        simple both in principle and in construction. </p>
      <p>No laser mirrors are needed, the optical gain of the rapid
        discharge is so large that the emission becomes super-radiant,
        that laser action takes place without an optical cavity. </p>
      <p>Ultraviolet lasers can be scaled to higher powers. A discharge
        path one meter long will develop an output pu1se of almost one
        million watts. Output is emitted from both ends of the column of
        excited gas, but a mirror at one end will more than double the
        power at the other end. </p>
      <p><b>K-Capture Technical Information ~</b> </p>
      <p>In some instances, where the ratio of neutrons to protons is
        low, a type of decay has been found to exist. Where a proton is

      <p>with a neutrino being formed at the same time. The product of
        this type of radioactivity would have the same number as its
        parent, but its atomic number would be one unit lower. The decay
        of the unstable Fe55 is by orbital electron capture, and can be
        represented by the equation </p>
      <p>26Fe55 + -1e0 -- 25mn55 </p>
      <p>The electron 0 which is captured by the iron nucleus being
        indicated by -1e0 on the left-hand side. </p>
      <p>The phenomenon described is referred to as a decay by electron
        capture. The electron is captured usually from the K level, or
        first quantum level, for such an electron is likely to be found
        near the nucleus; consequently, the expression K-electron
        capture, or K-capture is often employed. Instances of an
        electron being captured from the second quantum level, or L
        level, is not unknown although they are not common. The
        possibility of electron capture was predicted by the Japanese
        mathematical physicists H.Yukawa and S. Sakata in 1936. Proof of
        its reality was obtained in the United States by L. W. Alvarez
        in 1938. </p>
      <p>The detection of K-capture is dependent on the fact that the
        removal of a K-electron leaves a hole in the K quantum level. An
        electron from a higher quanta level will move in to fill the
        position, with the excess energy being emitted as a
        characteristic X-ray. Since K-capture precedes the electrons'
        transition and the emission of X rays, the X-ray will be the
        characteristic of the product nucleus with an atomic number one
        unit less. A case of this is Vanadium-49. The decay was found to
        be accompanied by the characteristic X-rays of the K series of
        the element of titanium. It is evident that Vanadium-49 decays
        by K-capture. </p>
      <p>When a Lithium-6 atom encounters an ultraviolet photon adding
        enough energy to cause a K-capture, its atomic number is changed
        and becomes a Helium-6 atom. Helium-6 is a radionuclide having a
        beta emission of 3.58 MeV. No other radiation is present except
        for a characteristic X-ray of Helium. </p>
      <p>Beta particles are captured in a magnetic field and stored in a
        capacitor bank before using their energy to do work. </p>
      <p>The number of reactions needed to produce a sizeable current
        flow is small. </p>
      <p>In the terms of energy needs, the usefulness of this process is
        clear. </p>

      <p>Excerpt from: "The Forgotten Art of Electric-Powered
        Automobiles" by Arthur Abrom </p>
      <p>..But, back to our electric automobiles -- in 1931, under the
        financing of Pierce-Arrow and George Westinghouse, a 1931
        Pierce-Arrow was selected to be tested at the factory grounds in
        Buffalo, NY. The standard internal combustion engine was removed
        and an 80-hp 1800&nbsp; rpm electric motor installed to the
        clutch and transmission. The AC motor measured 40 inches long
        and 30 inches in diameter and the power leads were left standing
        in the air -- no external power source! </p>
      <p>At the appointed time, Nikola Tesla&nbsp; arrived from New York
        City and inspected the Pierce-Arrow automobile.&nbsp; He then
        went to a local radio store and purchased a handful of tubes
        (12), wires and assorted resistors. A box measuring 24 inches
        long, 12 inches wide and 6 inches high was assembled housing the
        circuit. The box was placed on the front&nbsp; seat and had its
        wires connected to the air-cooled, brushless motor. Two rods
        1/4" in diameter stuck out of the box about 3" in length. </p>
      <p>Mr. Tesla got into the driver's seat, pushed the two rods in
        and stated, "We now have power". He put the car into gear and it
        moved forward! This vehicle, powered by an AC&nbsp; motor, was
        driven to speeds of 90 mph. and&nbsp; performed better than any
        internal combustion engine of its day! One week was spent
        testing the vehicle.&nbsp; Several newspapers in Buffalo
        reported this test. When asked where the power came from, Tesla
        replied, "From the ethers all around us". Several people
        suggested that Tesla was mad and somehow in league with sinister
        forces of the universe. He became incensed, removed his
        mysterious box from the vehicle and returned to his laboratory
        in New York City. His secret died with him! </p>
      <p>It is speculated that Nikola Tesla was able to somehow harness
        the earth's magnetic field that encompasses our planet. And, he
        somehow was able to draw tremendous amounts of power by cutting
        these lines of force or causing them to be multiplied together.
        The exact nature of his device remains a mystery but it did
        actually function by powering the 80 hp AC motor in the Pierce
        Arrow at speeds up to 90 m.p.h. and no recharging was ever
        necessary! </p>

        <p><b>"Information about an Invention by Dr. Nikola Tesla, which
            is said to have harnessed Cosmic Energy" </b>(Unidentified
          document circulated in the early 1980s)</p>
      </center>
      <p>The following is a summary of an interview on 16 September 1967
        of Peter Savo, a nephew of Dr. Nikola Tesla, by Derek Ahlers, an
        aeronautical engineer. An attempt was made to record Peter's
        answers to 36 questions prepared in advance. However, Peter
        talked very freely, in a somewhat rambling fashion, and
        repeatedly provided the answers before the questions were asked.
        In addition, since Mr Savo and Mr Ahlers have known each other
        for some 10 years, the subject had previously been discussed and
        some of this earlier information is included. </p>
      <p>Peter Savo was born in Knim, Yugoslavia, just before the turn
        of the century. As Yugoslavia was then a part of Austria, he
        entered the Austrian army and learned to fly at the military
        flying school at Wiener Neustadt. After World War 1 he emigrated
        to Italy. </p>
      <p>Dr Nikola Tesla was Peter's uncle on his mother's side. It was
        he who suggested that Peter come to the United States. He met
        Peter at the boat on arrival and seems to have taken a fatherly
        interest in him until his death… </p>
      <p>Sometime in 1931, Dr Tesla took Peter to Buffalo, NY for the
        unveiling and final testing of a new kind of automobile. Dr.
        Tesla acted somewhat mysteriously about it, would tell Peter
        nothing in advance, and even after he had seen the car, answered
        some of his questions with "Don't as any questions". </p>
      <p>The car turned out to be a standard Pierce Arrow, with the
        engine removed and certain other components installed instead.
        The standard Clutch, gear box and drive train remained
        installed. </p>
      <p>Under the hood, there was a brushless electric motor, connected
        to the engine [?]. The engine was said to measure 40" long by
        28" diameter. However, some of these figures may be estimates.
        Tesla would not divulge who made the motor. </p>
      <p>Set into the dash was a "power receiver" consisting of a box
        measuring about 24" long by 10" wide by 6" high, containing 12
        radio tubes. Three of these tubes were model 70-L-7. A vertical
        antenna consisting of a 6-foot rod, was installed and connected
        to the power receiver. </p>
      <p>The receiver, in turn, was connected to the motor by two heavy,
        conspicuous cables. Two "spindles" (rods?) about 1/4" diameter
        by 3" long protruded form the receiver towards the driver. Tesla
        pushed these in before starting and said: "We now have power".
        These spindles were in line with the two power cables coming out
        of the back of the unit and presumable worked to separate power
        switches. </p>
      <p>There was a 12-volt Willard battery installed in the car, but
        it was for the lights only and much too small to run the car. In
        any case, the motor was an AC motor. </p>
      <p>Peter said that Dr Tesla had built the power receiver himself
        in his hotel room, and carried it to Buffalo. The motor was
        built for him by some unknown company. The motor was completely
        enclosed and when Peter first saw it, it was stopped. Later,
        after the engine was running, Dr Tesla asked Peter to look under
        the hood to check whether the fan was running. Peter asked what
        the fan was for and was told that "The engine is running pretty
        hot". Maximum engine speed was 1800 rpm. Power rating was 80 hp.
      </p>
      <p>To start the car, Dr Tesla handed Peter an ignition-type key.
        Peter inserted it and a green light came on, on the dash. Dr
        Tesla thereupon said: "The engine is now in motion". The engine
        could not be heard from the driver's seat at all. When listening
        under the hood with the engine on, there was a slight hum. The
        standard accelerator pedal was used to control engine speed.
        Clutch, brake and gearshift were unchanged. </p>
      <p>The instruments on the dash appeared to be standard ones.
        However, there was a voltmeter which was used to measure output
        of the receiver. Dr Tesla commented that the receiver had enough
        reserve power so that you could drive the car next to a house,
        connect the wiring, and light up the whole house. There was also
        some kind of hydraulic pressure gauge on the dash. Peter asked
        its purpose but Dr Tesla would not tell him. </p>
      <p>Peter drove the car for about 50 miles at speeds up to 90 mph
        (the speedometer was calibrated to 120 mph). Power seemed at
        least as good as the normal Pierce Arrow engine. Acceleration in
        second gear seemed particularly good. Shifting gears seemed
        somewhat smoother than with a normal engine. </p>
      <p>Dr Tesla seemed enthusiastic on the first test ride and said,
        "Peter, this day will make history!" When Peter questioned the
        source of the energy to drive the car, Dr Tesla said: "It is a
        mysterious radiation that comes out of the ether." He said that
        he did not know where it came from but that it seemed to be
        available in limitless quantitites and that mankind should be
        thankful for it as it would soon drive boats, cars, trains and
        planes. Dr Tesla and Peter spent 8 days in Buffalo, testing the
        car. Peter described on incident where they stopped the car at a
        traffic light and a bystander commented that he could see no
        smoke coming from the exhaust. Peter replied to him: "We don't
        have an engine". When they left Buffalo, Dr Tesla removed the
        "ignition" key and the radio tubes and took them with him. The
        car was left at a farmhouse some 20 miles from Buffalo, not far
        from Niagara Falls. </p>
      <p>The car was kept under tight security and this was the reason
        for keeping it at such a remote spot. Peter heard a rumor that a
        secretary of Tesla's broke security and told General Electric
        about it and promptly got fired. Dr Tesla acted somewhat
        mysterious and would not answer many of Peter's questions.
        However, Peter considers this merely part of security measures
        and categorically ruled out any possibility of a hoax or
        practical joke. </p>
      <p>Peter knows of no specific persons to whom the car was shown.
        However, about a month after the Buffalo trip e got a phone call
        form Dr Lee De Forest who asked him: "How did you like that
        car?" Peter expressed his enthusiasm and De Forest then called
        Tesla one of the greatest living scientists. </p>
      <p>About 7 years ago Peter was approached by a Yugoslav diplomat
        then at the United Nations (Peter could not remember the name
        but has a record of it) who asked if he could find the engine
        and power receiver of that car. He dropped the name Rockefeller
        and said that they "could make millions" if they had this engine
        to copy. Peter made some attempts to comply, but without
        results. Peter is very anti-Tito and probably did not try very
        hard. The diplomat died about two years ago. </p>
      <p>Asked whether he knew of any other applications of this type of
        power, Peter said that Tesla was negotiating with some big
        shipbuilding concern to build a boat with such an engine.
        However, when he asked questions about this, Dr Tesla got
        annoyed and Peter never found out who the company was. </p>
      <p>When asked whatever happened to the car, Peter said that he had
        heard that it had been shipped to Yugoslavia. However, he has
        written to friends in Yugoslavia about this and they replied
        that nothing ever arrived. </p>
      <p>Upon being asked whether there was any possibility that
        drawings of the car might be in existence somewhere, Peter said
        there was a man in some town in Pennsylvania who might just have
        such information. </p>
      <p>Peter Savo is a lonely, bored old man, living in a cheap
        Manhattan hotel and supported by his two sons who are US Navy
        pilots in Viet Nam. His idleness and worries have induced a
        nervous condition with certain accompanying physical symptoms. I
        told Peter that he needed an aim and purpose in life and that
        reconstructing the facts of Dr Tesla's invention and giving them
        to eh world would be such a purpose, to say nothing of a
        probable financial reward. Peter thereupon said that he would
        phone the man in Pennsylvania and would phone others in Akron
        Ohio and in Chicago. He will also write to his relatives in
        Yugoslavia, who are surviving members of the Tesla family, to
        get all possible information. </p>
      <p>Since Peter was very poorly off financially, I gave his $20 out
        of my own pocket for the phone calls and postage. Peter is quite
        intelligent but lacks a formal education and has quite a thick
        accent. It is possible that he may be unable to reach the people
        he has in mind. However, in that event, it is still possible
        that a search by an experienced investigator who visits the
        places mentioned above, might locate them. However, this would
        of course cost more money and the question would then arise as
        to who has sufficient interest in this information to pay the
        expenses… </p>
      <p>Excerpts from Keelynet BBS Posts on this topic ~ </p>
      <p>Some fellow called up from Indiana or somewhere like that.. He
        says he has a&nbsp; fairly&nbsp; detailed article on the TESLA
        mystery power box as detailed in TESLAFE.ZIP... claims there
        were only three tubes and they were all BEAM RECTIFIER TYPES,
        hell he even&nbsp; gave us the tube&nbsp; numbers (70L7GT)... </p>
      <p>Re: The beam&nbsp; rectifier&nbsp; tubes&nbsp; reportedly&nbsp;
        used&nbsp; in&nbsp; Tesla's&nbsp; box...&nbsp; rectification
        implies the reception of an AC signal, which might imply that
        Tesla had another "toy" nearby broadcasting power, albeit on a
        smaller scale than some of his earlier projects. We believe this
        to indicate a smaller Wardenclyffe&nbsp; but there is no
        evidence of this.... </p>
      <p>The following data&nbsp; is copied&nbsp; verbatim from the 1964
        RCA Receiving Tube Manual. The 70L7GT is listed as a
        discontinued type so the wonderful descriptions of other tubes
        in the manual is unavailable for this type; however, a table of
        discontinued types at the back of the manual provided&nbsp; the
        following. The diagram is, of course, irreproducible in ASCII
        but it looks like a very ordinary keyed octal glass tube of its
        period, at 1-3/16" diameter, 2-7/8" high (above chassis). It
        does not possess a metal "tit" at the top. It appears that it's
        a dedicated-application tube for radio receivers (it both
        rectifies and amplifies, cutting down on tube count and saving
        manufacturing dollars), so I am&nbsp; immediately skeptical
        about any real significance to this&nbsp; type. There are
        related types, including the 117L7GT, but no direct
        substitution. Antique Electronic Supply in Tempe AZ apparently
        stocks this tube.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tube, used as indicated,
        appears very ordinary, however we can assume that Tesla did not
        exactly follow RCA recommended application tolerances (i.e. he
        hacked it). </p>

      <p>The following are the details as removed from the file TESLAFE1
        : </p>
      <p>The standard internal combustion engine was removed and an
        80-HP 1800 rpm electric motor installed to the clutch and
        transmission. The AC motor&nbsp; measured 40 inches long and 30
        inches in diameter and the power leads were left standing in the
        air --- no external power source! </p>
      <p>He then went to a local radio store and purchased a handful of
        tubes (12), wires and assorted resistors. A box measuring 24
        inches long, 12 inches wide and 6 inches high was assembled
        housing the circuit. The box was placed on the front seat and
        had its wires connected to the air-cooled, brushless motor. Two
        rods 1/4" in diameter stuck out of the box about 3" in length."
      </p>
      <p>We will first of all note the use of an AC coil motor. This
        alone tells us that the Tesla device was superior and not so
        dependent on tuning as was&nbsp; Moray's machine which could
        only power RESISTIVE loads. All universal energy moves in WAVES
        and so is essentially for alternating current (AC).&nbsp; That
        is why Moray called his book "THE SEA OF ENERGY IN WHICH THE
        EARTH FLOATS". The entire universe is continually bathed in
        these AC energies and they cover the entire frequency spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>What intrigues the&nbsp; hell out of me was how Tesla could use
        "off-the-shelf" vacuum tubes and other components, put them
        together in the correct configuration and make it work. </p>
      <p>Another point we should note is the list of components : <br>
        1)&nbsp; 12 Vacuum Tubes <br>
        2)&nbsp; Wires <br>
        3)&nbsp; Assorted Resistors <br>
        4)&nbsp; 1/4" diameter rods 3" in length </p>
      <p>NOTE, NO CAPACITORS! The wires could have been simply for
        connection or wound as coils. The 1/4" rods were either BUS BARS
        for power output taps OR more likely ANTENNAS! Resonant circuits
        can be constructed using several techniques. You can achieve the
        same effect from : <br>
        1)&nbsp; Resistors AND capacitors <br>
        2)&nbsp; Capacitors AND coils <br>
        3)&nbsp; Coils AND resistors </p>
      <p>So, in the case of the Tesla Power Box, he either wound his own
        coils or simply used the wire to connect the resistors with the
        vacuum tubes. I am of&nbsp; the opinion that he used the wire
        ONLY for connection and DID NOT USE COILS! I also think he used
        a DIODE somewhere in the circuit in order to tap ONLY one
        polarity. </p>
      <p>We have no specifications for the AC motor that Tesla used in
        the auto, so we have no idea if it was single or polyphase. In
        the case of a single phase&nbsp; motor, it only requires a
        single winding which projects a magnetic field that rotates
        according to the increase or decrease of the alternating
        current. </p>
      <p>A polyphase (poly = two or more) motor uses multiple windings
        which are fed by phased input currents that alternate in such a
        manner as to reinforce each other. In the case of a 3 phase
        motor, the currents are phased 120 degrees apart. This gives
        much greater torque to the motor but requires 3 times the
        current because it uses 3 times the input energy. </p>
      <p>Since the box powered an AC (coil) motor, it is probable it was
        TUNED to one or more frequencies, most likely polyphased
        frequencies. So, if the 3"&nbsp; long rods were in fact
        ANTENNAS, we can calculate their frequency by using the
        following : </p>
      <p>(I cannot express Lambda here so we will use w for wavelength)
      </p>
      <p>w = wavelength <br>
        v = velocity of propagation <br>
        f = signal frequency </p>
      <p>A short example:&nbsp; w = v / f = wavelength in feet <br>
        w = 984,000,000/1,500,000 = 656 feet <br>
        f = 984,000,000/656 = 1,500,000 or 1.5 MHZ </p>
      <p>3 inches x 4&nbsp; = 1 foot <br>
        984,000,000/1 = 984,000,000 <br>
        984,000,000/4 = 246,000,000 or 246 MHZ </p>
      <p>This would indicate the 3" rods (if they were truly 3" in
        length and functioning as antennas) would resonate at 246 MHZ. </p>
      <p>Because of the&nbsp; parts&nbsp; list description, I am of the
        opinion that it was a DUAL circuit. That is, 6 vacuum tubes and
        one 1/4" diameter 3" rod along with assorted resistors were to
        pick up and "pump" ONLY the positive going signals, while the
        other 6 vacuum&nbsp; tubes, rod and resistors did the same
        for&nbsp; the negative going signals. Such a scheme could either
        use PARALLEL or SERIAL connections of the vacuum tubes. Since
        current conduction is proportional to surface area, one would
        think that a parallel arrangement of the vacuum tubes with all
        INPUTS connected to one antenna source and all OUTPUTS connected
        to a common terminal attached to the load, would provide for the
        MAXIMUM current flow from incoming energy waves. </p>
      <p>The nature of these "energy waves" is the question here. Are
        they cosmic rays, electrostatic, Schumann peaks, magnetic force,
        something "other" or Aether flow into the neutral centers of
        mass as per Keely. </p>
      <p>Vacuum tube construction takes several&nbsp; forms. Of these,
        the simplest is two plates separated by a grid wire. When the
        bottom plate is heated, thermally induced ions (thermionic
        emissions) are emitted by the bottom plate. The grid can be
        biased by the application of voltage to increase,&nbsp; decrease
        or halt the flow of these ions to the upper plate. </p>
      <p>Other forms include more plates with more grids to allow better
        control of the ion&nbsp; flow. By proper biasing, vacuum tubes
        can be operated as switches, modulators or amplifiers among
        other uses. </p>
      <p>Vacuum tubes operate primarily with high voltages that control
        the ion flows. Modern transistors are equivalent to vacuum tubes
        except that they operate using CURRENT instead of voltage.
        Transistors equate to Vacuum tubes by the following comparisons
        : </p>
      <p>Vacuum Tube ~ Transistor ~ Polarity <br>
        Voltage ~ Current <br>
        Lower plate ~ Emitter ~&nbsp; negative-cathode <br>
        Grid ~ Base ~ neutral <br>
        Upper plate ~ Collector ~ Positive-anode </p>
      <p>In the case of the Tesla Power Box, the vacuum tube appears to
        function as a "pump", collecting incoming current in the form of
        ion intensification.&nbsp; Once this "compressed" ion field
        reaches a certain density, the pump allows it to be released
        into the next stage of the circuit, be it the actual load or
        another vacuum tube. </p>
      <p>So if the circuit is 6 vacuum tubes in parallel, all fed from a
        common antenna, outputting to a common load terminal, then the
        common antenna input would feed all vacuum tubes with the same
        wave. This would give the greatest CURRENT accumulation because
        of the EXPANDED SURFACE AREA of the paralleled tubes. </p>
      <p>Note, these vacuum tubes most likely operate in the "cold
        cathode" mode since the heaters of&nbsp; the vacuum tubes were
        not fed by any outside voltage to provide the heat for the more
        orthodox therionic emission. </p>
      <p>If the vacuum tubes are hooked in series, then one "pump" would
        feed another "pump" to get successively higher densities of
        electrons. This would give higher VOLTAGES because of increased
        PRESSURE. </p>
      <p>Keep in mind that electricity is much like air or water. We can
        think of voltage as pounds per square inch (PSI) and current as
        cubic feet per minute (CFM). That is PSI is pressure, CFM is
        flow. Another analog is comparing a river to electricity. In
        such a comparison, the speed of the river is the VOLTAGE or
        pressure while the width of the river is the CURRENT or rate of
        flow. Such a comparison shows WHY current requires THE GREATEST
        SURFACE AREA for the maximum flow. Fuses function on just this
        principle, when the current flows over the surface of the fuse,
        it&nbsp; creates heat. If too much current flows, it creates too
        much heat causing the fuse to melt and separate. The&nbsp; more
        surface area the fuse, the greater the amount of current can
        flow, another reason to not place a penny in a fuse socket. </p>
      <p>So we have two antennas (1/4" diameter, 3" long rods), two sets
        of 6&nbsp; vacuum tubes connected together by wire and assorted
        resistors. As the waves of energy are collected by the 3" rods,
        positive on one, negative on another, the energy builds up in
        the form of&nbsp; increased ions in each of the paralleled&nbsp;
        vacuum tubes. As in Moray's generator, the circuit will feed
        whatever load is attached as long as it does not EXCEED the
        current carrying capacity&nbsp; of&nbsp; the circuit components.
        What we have is an energy pumping system. </p>
      <p>Excerpt: <i>Secrets of Cold War Technology --- Project HAARP
          and Beyond</i>, by Gerry Vassilatos (ISBN 0-945685-20-3);
        "Tesla's Electric Car" (page 91) </p>
      <p>Tesla had already considered the condition of charged
        particles, each representing a tightly constricted whorl of
        aether. The force necessarily exerted at close distances by such
        aetheric constrictions was incalculably large. Aetheric
        ponderance maintained particulate stability. </p>
      <p>Crystalline lattices were therefore places within which one
        could expect to find unexpected voltages. Indeed, the high
        voltages inherent in certain metallic lattices, intra-atomic
        field energies, are enormous. The close Coulomb gradient between
        atomic centers are electrostatic potentials reaching humanly
        unattainable levels. </p>
      <p>By comparison, the voltages which Tesla once succeeded in
        releasing were quite insignificant. In these balanced lattices,
        Tesla sought the voltages needed to initiate directed aetheric
        streams in matter. </p>
      <p>Once such a flow began, one could simply tap the stream for
        power. </p>
      <p>In certain materials, these ether streams might automatically
        produce the contaminating electrons, a source of energy for
        existing appliances. One could theoretically then "tailor" the
        materials needed to produce unexpected aetheric power with or
        without the attendant detrimental particles. </p>
      <p>Tesla did mention the latent aetheric power of charged forces,
        the explosive potentials of bound Ether, and the aetheric power
        inherent in matter. </p>
      <p>By these studies, Tesla sought replacement for the 100,000,000
        volt initiating pulses which natural law required for the
        implementation of space Ether. Tesla had long been forced to
        abandon those gigantic means by other, less natural laws. </p>
      <p>Thereafter, Tesla shifted his attentions from the appreciation
        of the gigantic to an appreciation of the miniature. He sought a
        means for proliferating an immense number of small and compact
        aether power receivers. </p>
      <p>With one such device, Tesla succeeded in obtaining power to
        drive am electric car. But for the exceptional account which
        follows, we would have little information on this last period in
        Tesla's productive life, one which very apparently did not cease
        its prolific streams of creativity to his last breath. </p>
      <p>The information comes through an unlikely source, one rarely
        mentioned by Tesla biographers. It chanced that an aeronautical
        engineer, Derek Ahlers, met with one of Tesla's nephews then
        living in New York. Theirs was an acquaintance lasting some 10
        years, consisting largely of anecdotal commentaries on Dr.
        Tesla. Mr. Savo provided an enormous fund of knowledge
        concerning many episodes in Tesla's last years. </p>
      <p>Himself an Austrian military man and a trained aviator, Mr.
        Savo was extremely open about certain long-cherished incidents
        in which his uncle's genius was consistency made manifest. Mr.
        Savo reported that in 1931, he participated in an experiment
        involving aetheric power. Unexpectedly, almost inappropriately,
        he was asked to accompany his uncle on a long train ride to
        Buffalo. </p>
      <p>A few times in this journey, Mr. Savo asked the nature of their
        journey. Dr. Tesla remained unwilling to disclose any
        information, speaking rather directly to this issue. Taken into
        a small garage, Dr. Tesla walked directly to a Pierce Arrow,
        opened the hood and began making a few adjustments. In place of
        the engine, there was an AC motor. </p>
      <p>This measured a little more than 3 feet long, and a little more
        than 2 feet in diameter. From it trailed two very thick cables
        which connected with the dashboard. In addition, there was an
        ordinary 12 volt storage battery. The motor was rated at 80
        horsepower. </p>
      <p>Maximum rotor speed was stated to be 30 turns per second. A 6
        foot antenna rod was fitted into the rear section of the car. </p>
      <p>Dr. Tesla stepped into the passenger side and began making
        adjustments on a "power receiver" which had been built directly
        into the dashboard. </p>
      <p>The receiver, no larger than a short-wave radio of the day,
        used 12 special tubes which Dr. Tesla brought with him in a
        boxlike case. </p>
      <p>The device had been prefitted into the dashboard, no larger
        than a short-wave receiver. Mr. Savo told Mr. Ahler that Dr.
        Tesla built the receiver in his hotel room, a device 2 feet in
        length, nearly 1 foot wide, a 1/2 foot high. </p>
      <p>These curiously constructed tubes having been properly
        installed in their sockets, Dr. Tesla pushed in 2 contact rods
        and informed Peter that power was now available to drive. </p>
      <p>Several additional meters read values which Dr. Tesla would not
        explain. Not sound was heard. Dr. Tesla handed Mr. Savo the
        ignition key and told him to start the engine, which he promptly
        did. Yet hearing nothing, the accelerator was applied, and the
        car instantly moved. Tesla's nephew drove this vehicle without
        other fuel for an undetermined long interval. </p>
      <p>Mr. Savo drove a distance of 50 miles through the city and out
        to the surrounding countryside. The car was tested to speeds of
        90 mph, with the speedometer rated to 120. </p>
      <p>After a time, and with increasing distance from the city
        itself, Dr. Tesla felt free enough to speak. Having now become
        sufficiently impressed with the performance of both his device
        and the automobile. </p>
      <p>Dr. Tesla informed his nephew that the device could not only
        supply the needs of the car forever, but could also supply the
        needs of a household - with power to spare. When originally
        asked how the device worked, Tesla was initially adamant and
        refused to speak. </p>
      <p>Many who have read this "apocryphal account" have stated it to
        be the result of an "energy broadcast". This misinterpretation
        has simply caused further confusions concerning this stage of
        Tesla's work. He had very obviously succeeded in performing,
        with this small and compact device, what he had learned in
        Colorado and Shoreham. </p>
      <p>As soon as they were on the country roads, clear of the more
        congested areas, Tesla began to lecture on the subject. Of the
        motive source he referred to "a mysterious radiation which comes
        out of the aether". The small device very obviously and
        effectively appropriated this energy. </p>
      <p>Tesla also spoke very glowingly of this providence, saying of
        the energy itself that "it is available in limitless
        quantities". </p>
      <p>Dr. Tesla stated that although "he did not know where it came
        from, mankind should be very grateful for its presence". </p>
      <p>The two remained in Buffalo for 8 days, rigorously testing the
        car in the city and countryside. Dr. Tesla also told Mr. Savo
        that the device would soon be used to drive boats, planes,
        trains, and other automobiles. Once, just before leaving the
        city limits, they stopped at a streetlight and a bystander
        joyfully commented concerning their lack of exhaust fumes. </p>
      <p>Mr. Savo spoke up whimsically, saying that they had "no
        engine". They left Buffalo and traveled to a predetermined
        location which Dr. Tesla knew, an old farmhouse barn some 20
        miles from Buffalo. Dr. Tesla and Mr. Savo left the car in this
        barn, took the 12 tubes and the ignition key, and departed. </p>
      <p>Later on, Mr. Savo heard a rumor that a secretary had spoken
        candidly about both the receiver and the test run, being
        promptly fired for the security breach. About a month after the
        incident, Mr. Savo received a call from a man who identified
        himself as Lee De Forest, who asked how he enjoyed the car. </p>
      <p>Mr. Savo expressed his joy over the mysterious affair, and Mr.
        de Forest declared Tesla the greatest living scientist in the
        world. Later, Mr. Savo asked his uncle whether or not the power
        receiver was being used in other applications. </p>
      <p>He was informed that Dr. Tesla had been negotiating with a
        major shipbuilding company to build a boat with a similarly
        outfitted engine. Asked additional questions, Dr. Tesla became
        annoyed. Highly concerned and personally strained over the
        security of this design, it seems obvious that Tesla was
        performing these tests in a desperate degree of secrecy for good
        reasons. </p>
      <p>Tesla had already been the victim of several manipulations,
        deadly actions entirely sourced in a single financial house. For
        this reason, secrecy and care had become his only recent excess.
