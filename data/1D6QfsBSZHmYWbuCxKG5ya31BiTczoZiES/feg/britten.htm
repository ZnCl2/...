      <p>Electric light and power “as free as air” is the literal
        promise of Chancey J. Britten, 73-year old electrical wizard of
        Charlotte, Michigan. He is obtaining patents to safeguard his
        invention, a device which actually extracts electricity from the
        air without the aid of customary generators and motors. It
        consists of an aerial, home-made generator, and storage
        batteries. Photo shows him in front of his home, which he
        lighted for two years without expenditure of a penny for
        maintenance. At right is a closeup of the generator. Britten has
        defied anyone to explain the inner workings of his plant. </p>

        <p><b>Radio Apparatus</b> </p>
        <p><b>US Patent # 1,826,727 (Cl. 250-20)</b> <br>
          (October 31, 1931)</p>
      </center>
      <p>Chancy J. Britten, of Charlote, Michigan, assignor to Britten
        Light &amp; Power Company, of Lansing, Michigan, a corporation
        of Michigan </p>
      <p>This invention relates to improvements in radio apparatus in
        the nature of an economizer and clarifier. </p>
      <p>The objects of the invention are particularly to economize and
        conserve the current and to regulate and to clarify the tone. </p>
      <p>Further objects and objects pertaining to details and economies
        of construction and operation will definitely appear from the
        description to follow. </p>
      <p>I accomplish the objects of my invention by the devices and
        means described in the following specification. The invention is
        clearly defined and pointed out in the claim. </p>
      <p>A device embodying my invention s clearly illustrated in the
        accompanying drawings forming a part of this specification, in
        which: </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> is a detail perspective view of my improvement
        designed as an attachment to an ordinary radio set. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2 </b>is a full size vertical detail longitudinal
        elevation view partially ins ection on a central plane. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> is an enlarged detail sectional view on line
        3-3 of Figure 2 through the body of the main connection. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4</b> is a detail diagrammatic wiring view showing
        the relation of my apparatus in combination with a radio set. </p>
      <p>The parts will be identified by their numerals of reference
        which are the same in all the views. </p>
      <p>1 is the base which may be of glass or suitable insulating
        material. 2 is a metal supporting column secured to the glass
        base in any suitable way. 3 is the main connector of my improved
        economizer and regulator having a horizontal portion 31 disposed
        in proximity to the base and secured thereto by a suitable
        welded or soldered button 32. It has an upright portion and
        horizontal portion 33 disposed through the upright supporting
        post 2. This connector comprises an outer tube or casing 34
        preferably of copper, an inner central wire 35, around which is
        disposed a coil of wire 36. The coil of wire is embraced within
        a layer of mica insulating material 37. The tube is preferably
        under partial vacuum. Plugs 38 of insulation are in the ends of
        connector 3. </p>
      <p>The inner central wire 35 and the coil 36 have their ends
        connected to suitable binding posts. The binding post 4 on the
        lower horizontal part provides the connection to the radio set 5
        containing the usual A, B and C batteries&nbsp; and being
        otherwise organized as indicated diagrammatically in <b>Figure
          4</b>. </p>
      <p>The binding post 6 is provided with connection 7 leading to the
        positive terminal 8 of the battery 9. The negative terminal 11
        of the battery 9, which is a 4-1/2 volt dry cell battery, is
        connected to the lead 10 to the aerial. </p>
      <p>The battery 9 is a duplicate of the C battery of 4-1/2 volt
        capacity but is not coupled up to act as a C battery but in the
        particular auxiliary relation specified herein. </p>
      <p>Just how the structure results in the advantages stated is
        problematical and applicant is only able to state the results
        and define the structure which accomplishes the same without
        expanding on the theory by which it is accomplished. </p>
      <p>Having thus described my invention, what I claim as new and
        desire to secure by letters patent is: </p>
      <p>The combination with a radio set comprising A, B, and C
        batteries and an aerial of an economizer and clarifying device
        comprising an auxiliary battery dry cell, a base with post, a
        metallic tubular casing with a horizontal lower part and an
        upright and an upper horizontal part disposed through said post,
        a central conductor, a coil of wire around the conductor, the
        opposite ends of said conductor and coil being connected to a
        single binding post mounted on the upper and lower ends of the
        tubular casing which casing is suitably sealed at the ends, a
        mica insulation between said coil and the casing, a connection
        fro the lower binding post to the antenna connection of the
        radio set and from the upper binding post to the positive
        terminal of said battery dry cell, and a connection from the
        negative terminal of the said battery cell to the aerial of said
        radio set. </p>
      <p>In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand, </p>
