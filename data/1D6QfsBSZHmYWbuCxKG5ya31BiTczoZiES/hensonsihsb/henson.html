      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>This invention relates to a novel method of, and means for,
      directing energy through Si2HSb2 in such a manner that normal
      energy parameters can be exceeded. The principal object of the
      invention is to provide the means for more efficient radiant
      energy power systems to be constructed. For example, this
      invention can be applied to construct more efficient rocket
      propulsion systems. Si2HSb2 has a crystalline structure with a
      regular pattern of electron deficiencies which physicists call
      "holes" in the lattice. Energy can be radiated at the top of the
      compound and be accelerated as it passes through to a new higher
      velocity as it expelled out the bottom of the compound. This is
      accomplished by applying electrical potentials to the sides of the
      compound which rectify the "holes" in the lattice. The electrical
      potentials applied to the sides of the compound can be varied to
      allow the radiated energy output to be directed in the x,y plane.
      Thus the compound can be used as an excellent propulsion system.
      It can also be used to enhance any output of a radiated energy
      source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The field of this invention is: CLASS 423, CHEMISTRY, INORGANIC.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A patent search and a search of CHEMICAL ABSTRACTS back to 1982
      was made to determine scope and extent of the prior art. The
      closest art known to the inventor is silicon semiconductor theory.
      It is well known that if a small amount (as little as 0.0001 mole
      per cent) of an atom of boron or other element with three valence
      electrons is introduced into the crystal lattice of pure silicon,
      an electron deficiency is created at the site of the foreign atom.
      This defect in the covalent bonds of the silicon atoms is
      described by physicists as a "positive hole." Conduction of
      electricity in this type of crystal, a p-type semiconductor, can
      be thought of as a movement of positive holes through the lattice.
      This invention has nothing to do with semiconduction as it relates
      to solid state electronics or the creation of electricity from
      solar radiation. The present invention creates a crystal lattice
      which contains a "hole" in each Si2 HSb2 molecule. The "holes" in
      the present invention are more plentiful than "holes" in known
      p-type semiconductors. The "holes" in the present invention are
      regular and uniform and can be controlled by electrical potentials
      to allow radiant energy to pass through the compound and be
      accelerated and directed as it does so.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention includes the compound Si2 HSb2 which is
      poured into a mold. The compound has electrodes molded into it.
      The compound is allowed to cool and crystallize and is removed
      from the mold. The present invention can then be used by allowing
      radiant energy to strike the top of the compound. The radiant
      energy passes through the compound and exits the bottom. The
      amplification factor is typically 184,000 times the power input.
      Electrical potentials are applied to the sides of the compound to
      control the "holes" in the crystal lattice. The control power must
      be approximately 24 times the input power. This ratio allows the
      proper manipulation factor for the power output to be varied in
      the x,y plane by varying the control power input to either side of
      the compound.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention allows a radiant energy rocket propulsion
      system to be constructed. The present invention also provides the
      means to increase the output of any radiant energy power system.
      The compound does not wear out nor is it consumed. There is no
      chemical reaction associated with the increased radiant power
      output. The physical parameters of the "holes" provide a catalyst
      effect to produce the increased velocity in the radiant energy
      which is input into the top of the compound.<br>
      <br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The crystalline form of the Si2 HSb2 compound can be manufactured
      using the following process:<br>
      <br>
      Silicon is placed in a mixture with equal parts of antimony.<br>
      <br>
      This mixture then has a dilute aqueous solution of nitric acid
      added to it. SiNSb precipitates out of solution. The precipitate
      is separated from the solution and is heated at 490-510 degrees
      Celsius. The substance that remains is Si2 NSb2. This process can
      be described by the following chemical reactions:<br>
      <br>
      Si+N@3+ +HO2@3- +Sb@3- .fwdarw.SiNSb+HO2@3-<br>
      SiNsb+SiNSb.fwdarw.Si2 NSb2 +N@3-<br>
      <br>
      Silicon is placed in a mixture with antimony in equal parts and
      the mixture is immersed in pure water. This mixture is then
      subjected to 490-510 degrees Celsius. The SiHSb precipitates and
      is then extracted. The SiHSb is then subjected to 490-510 degrees
      Celsius. The noncrystalline compound Si2 HSb2 remains after the
      other compounds have boiled away. This process can be described by
      the following chemical reactions:<br>
      <br>
      Si+H@+ +HO@- +Sb@3- .fwdarw.SiHSb+HO@-<br>
      SiHSb+SiHSb.fwdarw.Si2 HSb2 +H@+ (This product won't crystallize
      in the correct manner.)<br>
      <br>
      The solids, Si2 HSb2 and Si2 NSb2, are then put in a mixture of
      equal parts. An exothermic reaction results after the reaction is
      started with a 490-510 degree Celsius application of heat. A Si2
      Sb liquid forms on top of the mixture and is poured off. The Si2
      HSb3 resultant is the solid. This process can be described by the
      following chemical reaction:<br>
      <br>
      Si2 HSb2 +Si2 NSb2 .fwdarw.Si2 HSb3 +Si2 Sb<br>
      <br>
      The Si2 HSb3 is then subjected to prolonged heating at 370-380
      degrees Celsius. This heating causes Si2 HSb2 to form as a liquid
      on the top of the Si2 HSb3. This liquid, when poured off, is the
      required compound. This process can be described by the following
      chemical reaction:<br>
      Si2 HSb3 .fwdarw.Si2 HSb2 +Sb@3-<br>
      <br>
      The Si2 HSb2 compound is poured into the form which gives it the
      proper shape and the electrodes are placed in the proper locations
      at the sides of the form. The liquid is allowed to cool to the
      required solid shape. It crystallizes as it cools. The crystal can
      be formed into any shape and it will still retain its ability to
      amplify energy.<br>
      <br>
      The crystal actually works as a energy particle accelerator. It
      has all of the necessary characteristics of a conventional energy
      accelerator but it accelerates the particles at a molecular level
      using strong nuclear forces. The crystal incorporates all of the
      aspects of other conventional accelerators. A source of energy
      particles is directed at the crystal, strong nuclear forces induce
      the acceleration, the electron deficient "holes" act as an
      evacuated space in which the particles may move unimpeded, and a
      means for guiding the particles to keep them within the space is
      provided by the structure of the covalent bonds between the
      silicon an antimony.<br>
      <br>
      A good question of this system is how a particle such as a photon
      traveling at the speed of light could be further accelerated as it
      passed through this crystal. The answer to that question could be
      that the crystal accelerator provides an energy gain from its
      strong nuclear forces to the particles which shows up as an
      increase of their effective mass. Another answer is that the
      energy law E=Mc@2 is changed when radiant energy units are
      subjected to certain forces such as the nuclear forces in the
      crystal. The speed of light is no longer limited and it conforms
      to the new equation E=McX. The value of X in the crystal
      approaches 3.times.10@20 meters per second.<br>
      <br>
      The crystal has a unique property of allowing radiant energy to be
      directed at it and the speed of the energy is increased as it
      passes through the crystal. This is accomplished through a process
      in which the energy particles are acted upon by strong nuclear
      forces which are put into play because of the unusual structure of
      the crystal. The covalent bonds between the silicon and antimony
      stabilize the elements and maintain the crystalline structure. The
      hydrogen element which is uniformly dispersed in the crystal
      causes an anomaly in the crystal which is commonly called a
      "hole." It is an electron deficient area which is held open
      through nuclear forces until a negatively charged particle
      occupies the space. These nuclear forces act to attract an
      electron or any unit of energy such as a light photon or a gamma
      ray. This attraction of energy particles can be multiplied as the
      particle passes through the crystal from one molecular crystal
      unit zone of attraction to another. This multiplication of
      attractive forces accelerates the energy unit as it passes through
      the crystal and can make the particle exceed the speed of light.
      Since energy output is a function of mass and speed of the mass
      squared, any increase in particle speed causes a dramatic increase
      in energy output with very little control energy input. The
      control energy input to the system is required to align the
      hydrogen elements within the crystalline structure. These protons
      surrounded by holes can be moved in the x,y plane by applying the
      appropriate charges to the sides of the crystal. The application
      of these charges causes a displacement of the energy units being
      amplified through the crystal because of the attractive and
      repulsive effect of the proton as the particles pass through or in
      close proximity to the proton's energy field.<br>
      <br>
      The energy particle dynamics as they pass through the crystal are
      very unique. The particles are accelerated by passing close to the
      proton in such a manner that they are effected by its nuclear
      forces. The protons are all aligned so that the accelerations are
      built upon from proton to proton. This effect is similar to the
      increase in velocity given to satellites which pass in close
      proximity to the orbit of a planet but have sufficient velocity to
      escape the gravitational pull of the planet and are propelled out
      of orbit and again into space.<br>
      <br>
      The types of energy which can be amplified by the crystal are
      infinite. Radiant energy from infrared to high energy particles
      produced by fusion or fission can be amplified. A large crystal
      can be used in conjunction with radiant energy from the sun to
      provide enough heat output to power a typical city. A smaller
      crystal can be used in conjunction with fission reactions to power
      vehicles. The vehicular power to weight ratios allow the vehicles
      to fly. The crystal can be used in conjunction with an electron
      emitter to enhance the power output of many electrical devices.
      The crystal can be used in conjunction with any type of laser to
      radically improve its output. A large crystal could amplify
      radiant energy from the sun which could then be reflected through
      the use of mirrors to other crystals which would further enhance
      the output. The ability of a crystal to amplify energy is limited.
      If highly energized particles are directed at the crystal with
      sufficient magnitude and duration, the crystal can overheat and
      begin to melt. A larger crystal is able to withstand larger
      magnitude and duration energy inputs. The size of the crystal also
      determines the amplification factor of the input versus output of
      energy. The thicker the crystal, the more amplification it can
      provide to energy input. The crystal is very durable. It does not
      wear out or become weaker over time. The nuclear forces which
      speed the energy through the crystal are natural forces which are
      similar to gravity in the respect that it is a force which never
      weakens or is used up. The crystal is also durable with respect to
      its ability to withstand physical abuse. It can be used as the
      exterior skin of a vehicle which it is powering.<br>
      <br>
      A more detailed description of putting this crystal power
      amplifier to practical use is in order. The crystal can be used to
      power a vehicle capable of flying into outer space. The entire
      bottom of the craft could be composed of the formed crystal. The
      remaining skin of the craft could be composed of SiPbSb3 in sheets
      of approximately 1/2" to 1". The power supply of the craft could
      be the energy released from a radioactive isotope of uranium. The
      radiant energy emanating from the fission reaction could be
      controlled in the same manner that is currently used in naval
      propulsion systems. The nuclear fission radiant energy output
      would be shielded at its top and sides, but the energy irradiated
      downward could be directed at the top of the crystal. The crystal
      could then amplify this radiant energy by a factor of 184,000.
      This power to weight ratio would allow the craft to overcome the
      earth's gravitational field and proceed into space with an intact
      and long lasting power supply. The craft could be controlled by
      varying the power input to the electrodes on the sides of the
      crystal causing the radiant power output from the craft to be
      directed in the x,y plane. The optimum control power ratio to
      allow the craft to be directionally controlled with the proper
      finesse occurs when the control power input is 24 times the
      radiant power input to the crystal. The control power input can be
      developed utilizing generators powered by the output of the
      crystal.<br>
      <br>
      This type of craft would only be limited by the size of the power
      supply. It would be very stable both in the atmosphere and in
      outer space. The maximum velocity in the atmosphere would be
      limited by the maximum hull temperature of 500 degrees Celsius.<br>
