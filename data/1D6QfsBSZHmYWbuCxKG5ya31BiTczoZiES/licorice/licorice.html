      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      In Japan, glycyrrhizin injections have been used as a therapeutic
      drug for allergy inflammation since 1948 and for chronic hepatitis
      since 1979. A 20 ml injection of glycyrrhizin contains 53 mg of
      monoammonium glycyrrhizinate (40 mg as glycyrrhizin acid), 400 mg
      of glycine, and 20 mg of L-cysteine. Patients receiving
      glycyrrhizin injections two or three times per week are forced to
      accept a decline in quality of life. Because administering
      glycyrrhizin by injection has some disadvantages, many researchers
      have systematically searched for novel glycyrrhizin formulations
      that can be administered through oral, rectal, intranasal, and
      subcutaneous routes. There are two problems, however, in
      developing new formulations: (1) glycyrrhizin has low membrane
      permeability and is thus poorly absorbed, and (2) highly
      concentrated glycyrrhizin readily forms gels in aqueous solutions.
      Here, we describe the utility of glycyrrhizin formulations
      prepared in safe solubility agents and absorption-enhancing
      agents, as assessed in animal experiments. We also discuss
      pharmaceutical issues in developing various glycyrrhizin
      formulations. In the near future, convenient pharmaceutical
      preparations of glycyrrhizin will be developed for chronic
      hepatitis patients who require glycyrrhizin therapy.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Glycyrrhizin is the major active component extracted from licorice
      (Glycyrrhiza glabra) roots, one of the most widely used herbal
      preparations for the treatment of liver disorders. This study
      evaluated the potential beneficial effect of glycyrrhizin in a
      mouse model of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver injury.
      The mice were treated intraperitoneally with CCl(4) (0.5 ml/kg).
      They received glycyrrhizin (50, 100, 200, 400 mg/kg) 24 h and 0.5
      h before and 4 h after administering CCl(4). The serum activities
      of aminotransferase and the hepatic level of malondialdehyde were
      significantly higher 24 h after the CCl(4) treatment, while the
      concentration of reduced glutathione was lower. These changes were
      attenuated by glycyrrhizin. CCl(4) increased the level of
      circulating tumor necrosis factor-alpha markedly, which was
      reduced by glycyrrhizin. The levels of hepatic inducible nitric
      oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and heme oxygenase-1 protein
      expression were markedly higher after the CCl(4) treatment.
      Glycyrrhizin diminished these alterations for inducible nitric
      oxide and cyclooxygenase-2 but the protein expression of heme
      oxygenase-1 was further elevated by the treatment of glycyrrhizin.
      CCl(4) increased the level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
      inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase-2, and heme
      oxygenase-1 mRNA expressions. The mRNA expression of heme
      oxygenase-1 was augmented by the glycyrrhizin treatment, while
      glycyrrhizin attenuated the increase in tumor necrosis
      factor-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and
      cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expressions. These results suggest that
      glycyrrhizin alleviates CCl(4)-induced liver injury, and this
      protection is likely due to the induction of heme oxygenase-1 and
      the downregulation of proinflammatory mediators.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Liver cell damage is induced when isolated liver cells coated with
      specific antibody against the liver cell membrane are cultured
      with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although this
      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) was induced
      by closed contact of effector cells with targets via specific
      antibody, a cytotoxic factor or factors causing inhibition of
      protein synthesis in liver cells was detected in the culture
      supernatant of the ADCC reaction. Similarly, peritoneal exudate
      macrophages activated by endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also
      had cytotoxic effects on isolated liver cells by producing a
      cytotoxic substance or substances. These liver cell injuries
      caused by either ADCC or activated macrophage culture supernatants
      were significantly reduced by pretreatment of the isolated liver
      cells with glycyrrhizin before the addition of the cytotoxic
      culture supernatants. These results suggest that glycyrrhizin may
      protect liver cells from immunological injuries.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The present study aimed to give a short report on a possible
      mechanism of glycyrrhizin to acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity.
      Seven-day intraperitoneal administration of glycyrrhizin (400
      mg/kg/day) to 2- to 3-month-old male C57BL/6N mice (mean weight 27
      g) significantly prevents acetaminophen-induced liver damage, as
      indicated by the activity of alanine transaminase and aspartate
      aminotransferase. Metabolomics analysis and principal component
      analysis (PCA) using ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled to
      triple time-of-flight mass spectrometer were performed. PCA
      separated well the control, glycyrrhizin-treated,
      acetaminophen-treated, and glycyrrhizin+acetaminophen-treated
      groups. Long-chain acylcarnitines were listed as the top ions that
      contribute to this good separation, which include oleoylcarnitine,
      palmitoylcarnitine, palmitoleoylcarnitine, and myristoylcarnitine.
      The treatment of glycyrrhizin significantly reversed the increased
      levels of long-chain acylcarnitines induced by acetaminophen
      administration. In conclusion, this metabolomic study indicates a
      significant glycyrrhizin protection effect against
      acetaminophen-induced liver damage through reversing fatty acid
      metabolism.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Objective and design</b><br>
      <br>
      In this study, the possible protective effect of glycyrrhizin
      (GL), an active compound derived from licorice root, was examined
      on T cell-mediated liver injury in mice.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and methods</b><br>
      <br>
      Mice were subjected to liver injury by intravenous injection of
      concanavalin A (Con A). They had been treated with GL (i.p.) 30
      min before the injection. Liver injury was estimated by measuring
      serum levels of alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) and aspartate
      aminotransaminase (AST), and by examining liver sections with
      hematoxylinâ€“eosin staining. Expression of inducible nitric oxide
      synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein in the liver was determined by
      reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and
      Western blotting.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      Serum transaminases and hepatic iNOS levels increased with time
      after Con A treatment. Expression of iNOS mRNA in the liver was
      elevated for up to 8 h, and at 8 h, GL (ED50: 10.5 mg/kg)
      suppressed the increases in AST and ALT in response to Con A. An
      increase in iNOS mRNA expression and protein was inhibited by
      treatment with GL. Furthermore, GL inhibited cell infiltration and
      the degeneration of hepatocytes in the liver of Con A-treated
      mice.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      The present study suggests that the prevention by GL of Con
      A-induced hepatitis is due partly to the modulation of hepatic
      iNOS induction and of degeneration of hepatocytes.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is a triterpene glycoside found in the
      roots of licorice plants (Glycyrrhiza glabra). GA is the most
      important active ingredient in the licorice root, and possesses a
      wide range of pharmacological and biological activities. GA
      coupled with glycyrrhetinic acid and 18-beta-glycyrrhetic acid was
      developed in China or Japan as an anti-inflammatory, antiviral,
      and antiallergic drug for liver disease. This review summarizes
      the current biological activities of GA and its medical
      applications in liver diseases. The pharmacological actions of GA
      include inhibition of hepatic apoptosis and necrosis;
      anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory actions; antiviral
      effects; and antitumor effects. This paper will be a useful
      reference for physicians and biologists researching GA and will
      open the door to novel agents in drug discovery and development
      from Chinese herbs. With additional research, GA may be more
      widely used in the treatment of liver diseases or other
      conditions.<br>

      OBJECTIVE : To investigate the effects of Compound Glycyrrhizin
      Injection (CGI) on liver function and cellular immunity of
      children with infectious mononucleosis complicated liver
      impairment (IM-LI) and to explore its clinical therapeutic effect.<br>
      <br>
      METHODS : Forty-two patients with IM-LI were randomly assigned,
      according to the randomizing number table, to two groups, 20 in
      the control group and 22 in the treated group. All the patients
      were treated with conventional treatment, but to those in the
      treated group, CGI was given additionally once a day, at the
      dosage of 10 ml for children aged below 2 years, 20 ml for 2-4
      years old, 30 ml for 5-7 years old and 40 ml for 8- 12 years old,
      in 100-200 ml of 5% glucose solution by intravenous dripping. The
      treatment lasted for 2 weeks. T lymphocyte subsets and serum
      levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase
      (AST) and total bilirubin (TBil) were detected before and after
      treatment. Besides, a normal control group consisting of 20
      healthy children was also set up.<br>
      <br>
      RESULTS : Baseline of the percentage of CD3 + , CD8 + lymphocyte
      and serum levels of ALT, AST, TBiL in the children with IM-LI were
      markedly higher, while the percentage of CD4 + lymphocyte and the
      CD4 + /CD8 + ratio was markedly lower in IM-LI children as
      compared with the corresponding indices in the healthy children (
      P&lt;0.01). These indices were improved after treatment in both
      groups of patients, but the improvement in the treated group was
      better than that in the control group (P&lt;0.01).<br>
      <br>
      CONCLUSION : Cellular immunity dysfunction often occurs in
      patients with IM-LI, and CGI treatment can not only obviously
      promote the recovery of liver function, but also regulate the
      immune function in organism. <br>

      <br>
      High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) acts as an early mediator of
      inflammation and organ damage in hepatic ischemia-reperfusion
      (I/R) injury. Glycyrrhizin is a natural anti-inflammatory and
      antiviral triterpene in clinical use. The purpose of this study
      was to investigate the effect of glycyrrhizin on liver injury
      caused by I/R and production of HMGB1 by Kupffer cells in rats. In
      the first test period, rats were given saline or glycyrrhizin 20
      min before segmental hepatic warm I/R. Serum alanine
      aminotransferase and HMGB1 levels and hepatic histopathological
      findings were evaluated after I/R. Furthermore, expression of
      HMGB1 in the liver was assessed by immunohistochemical staining
      after I/R. Kupffer cells were isolated by collagenase digestion
      and differential centrifugation, and production of HMGB1 was
      assessed. In another set of experiments, the effect of inhibition
      of Kupffer cells by injection of liposome-entrapped
      dichloromethylene diphosphonate (lipo-MDP) on liver injury and
      expression of HMGB1 were investigated after I/R. Liver injury was
      prevented in the glycyrrhizin group compared with the control
      group. Furthermore, serum HMGB1 levels were also significantly
      blunted in the glycyrrhizin group compared with the control group.
      Cells expressing HMGB1 were detected in the hepatic sinusoid by
      immunohistochemistry and recognized morphologically as Kupffer
      cells. Furthermore, the expression of HMGB1 was reduced in the
      glycyrrhizin group compared with the control group. Production of
      HMGB1 was reduced in Kupffer cells isolated from the glycyrrhizin
      group compared with the control group. It is noteworthy that
      treatment with lipo-MDP significantly blunted serum HMGB1 levels
      and prevented liver injury after I/R. These results suggest that
      glycyrrhizin has the therapeutic potential to prevent warm
      I/R-induced injury during hepato-biliary surgery.<br>

      Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is an artificial way to support
      daily nutritional requirements by bypassing the digestive system,
      but long-term TPN administration may cause severe liver
      dysfunction. Glycyrrhizin is an active component of licorice root
      that has been widely used to treat chronic hepatitis. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of
      glycyrrhizin on TPN-associated acute liver injury in vivo. Liver
      dysfunction was induced by intravenous infusion of TPN at a flow
      rate of 20 mL/kg/h for three h in Sprague Dawley rats. The rats
      were pretreated with Glycyrrhizin (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg
      intravenously). After receiving TPN or saline (control group) for
      three h, the rats were sacrificed, blood samples were collected
      for biochemical analyses and liver tissue was removed for
      histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. We found
      that aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT), total bilirubin (TB) and triglyceride (TG) levels were
      significantly increased in the TPN group without glycyrrhizin
      pretreatment and decreased in the glycyrrhizin-pretreated TPN
      group in a dose-dependent manner. The stained liver sections
      showed that glycyrrhizin relieved acute liver injury. The
      upregulation of serum protein biomarkers of reactive nitrogen
      species, including nitrotyrosine and inducible NO synthase (iNOS),
      were attenuated by glycyrrhizin pretreatment. Levels of
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress factors, such as phosphorylation
      of JNK1/2, p38 MAPK and CHOP, were decreased by glycyrrhizin
      pretreatment. In summary, our results suggest that glycyrrhizin
      decreases TPN-associated acute liver injury factors by suppressing
      endoplasmic reticulum stress and reactive nitrogen stress.<br>

      Glycyrrhizin, a biological active compound isolated from the
      liquorice root, has been used as a treatment for chronic
      hepatitis. We have examined the involvement of matrix
      metalloproteinase (MMP)9 in the development of lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) and D-galactosamine (GalN)-induced liver injury in mice. We
      also investigated the effect of glycyrrhizin on expression of
      MMP-9 in this model. Levels of serum alanine aminotransferase
      (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased after LPS/
      GalN treatment. Expression of MMP-9 mRNA and protein was markedly
      up-regulated in liver tissues 6-8 h after LPS/GalN treatment.
      Pretreatment with glycyrrhizin (50 mg kg(-1)) and the MMP
      inhibitor (5 mg kg(-1)) suppressed increases in serum levels of
      ALT and AST in mice treated with LPS/GalN. Furthermore,
      glycyrrhizin inhibited levels of both mRNA and protein for MMP-9.
      Immunohistochemical reaction for MMP-9 was observed in
      macrophages/monocytes infiltrated in the inflammatory area of
      liver injury. Glycyrrhizin reduced the infiltration of
      inflammatory cells and immunoreactive MMP- 9 in liver injury. The
      results indicated that MMP-9 played a role in the development of
      LPS/GalN- induced mouse liver injury, and suggested that an
      inhibition by glycyrrhizin of the acute liver injury may have been
      due to a down-regulation of MMP-9.<br>

      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present disclosure provides an alcoholic beverage having
      reduced hepato-toxicity. The invention also relates to a process
      for the preparation of the said beverage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ethanol consumption could lead to 60 medical conditions. Acute as
      well as chronic toxic effect of ethanol may ensue in irreversible
      organ damage (Das S. K. et. al., Indian journal of Biochemistry
      &amp; Biophysics, 2010, Vol. 47, 32). The widely accepted forms of
      alcoholic liver diseases (ALD) are simple fatty liver (steatosis),
      which is reversible with abstinence, fatty liver accompanied by
      inflammation (steato-hepatitis) leads to scar tissue formation
      (fibrosis), the destruction of the normal liver structure (liver
      cirrhosis), which may or may not improve with abstinence and
      subsequently lead to liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). In
      2010, WHO suggests 10% of the adult population in the United
      States suffering from alcohol use disorders and liver cirrhosis is
      the 12th leading cause of death in United States (Alcohol and
      Health, Focus on: Alcohol and the Liver, 2010, Vol. 33, No. 1 and
      2, 87). It is known that 5% of the ethyl alcohol i.e. ethanol
      (hereinafter alcohol), ingested by a human being is excreted
      unchanged while the remaining 95% is degraded to acetaldehyde.
      Alcohol is rapidly absorbed from the GI tract. In fasting state
      the peak blood alcohol concentration reaches within 30 minutes.
      Distribution is rapid with tissue levels approximating blood
      concentrations. Liver accounts for nearly 90% of alcohol
      metabolism the remainder is excreted through the lungs &amp;
      urine. The typical adult can metabolize 7-10 g of alcohol/hour
      (U.S. Pat. No. 7,666,909B2).<br>
      <br>
      The primary pathway of alcohol metabolism, when consumed in low to
      moderate amount, is mainly catalyzed in the cytoplasm of
      hepatocytes by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to form acetaldehyde.
      The accumulation of NADH (excess reducing equivalents) in the
      liver plays a role in liver damage seen more prominently with
      chronic alcohol use. Acetaldehyde produced through microsomal
      ethanol oxidation system (MEOS) initially represents a minor
      pathway of ethanol oxidation probably accounting for less than
      10%, of the liver capacity to oxidize ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      At higher alcohol level (&gt;100 mg/dl), MEOS is dependent on
      CYP450 (2E1, 1A2 &amp; 3A4) plays significant role in alcohol
      metabolism using NADPH as a cofactor &amp; O2. Catalase is
      especially capable of oxidizing ethanol in fasting state in the
      presence of hydrogen peroxide generating system. Acetaldehyde is
      oxidized in the liver via mitochondrial nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide (NAD&lt;+&gt;) dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase
      (ALDH) to acetate. Activity of ALDH is nearly 3 times lower that
      ADH, hence accumulation of Acetaldehyde takes place. Acetate is
      further metabolized to acetyl CoA and can enter min TCA cycle or
      synthesis fatty acids. Each of these pathway results in the
      formation of free radicals (like reactive oxygen species {ROS})
      with concomitant changes in the cells redox state (i.e. in the
      ratio of NADH to NAD&lt;+&gt; results in production of more NADH
      (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NAD&lt;+&gt;) reduced by two
      electrons). The cell has a limited capacity to oxidize NADH back
      to NAD&lt;+&gt; in mitochondrial respiratory chain at the maximum
      capacity of this system, which determines the kinetics of the
      reaction. The redox state in relation to alcohol metabolism causes
      inhibition of NAD&lt;+&gt;-mediated enzyme reactions typical to
      the normal metabolism of the hepatocyte. The citric acid cycle is
      affected the most as it gets inhibited. This leads to positive
      NADH/NAD ratio, which is considered the most important reason for
      the development of alcohol-induced fatty liver. The maximum
      capacity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain depends on the
      overall level of metabolism of the body. The consequence of
      altered redox state includes Hypoxia (oxygen deficit cell). The
      other plausible pathway of alcohol induced hepatotoxicity includes
      excess production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by gut-endotoxin
      stimulated Kupffer cells. ROS is mainly generated in association
      with the mitochondrial electron transport system; it is also
      produced by CYP2E1 and by activated Kupffer cells in the liver.
      Both acute and chronic alcohol consumption can increase ROS
      production, which leads to oxidative stress through a variety of
      pathways mentioned above [(Zakhari, S. Alcohol Research &amp;
      Health, 2006, 29, 4, 245), (Wheeler M. D. et al, Free Radical
      Biology &amp; Medicine, 2001, Vol. 31, No. 12, 1544), (Koop, D.
      R., Alcohol Research &amp; Health, 2006, 29, 4, 274), (U.S. Pat.
      No. 7,666,909B2)].<br>
      <br>
      The mechanisms involved by which alcohol causes cell injury are
      complex and combination of several inter-related pathways. ROS
      react primarily with the cell membrane (tight junction becomes
      more permeable) and in turn leaks lipopolysaccharides (LPS), as a
      consequence impaired gut structural integrity. The increases in
      transaminase enzymes [aspartate amino-transferase (AST) and
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT)] indicate cellular leakage and loss
      of functional integrity of cell membrane (Yue et. J, 2006). Loss
      of cellular integrity affects hepato-biliary function leading to
      elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) activities with concurrent
      increase in serum bilirubin level and decrease in the total plasma
      protein content. Both increases and decreases in the levels of ROS
      can lead to apoptosis of hepatocytes (Wheeler M. D. Alcohol Res.
      Health, 2003; 27, 300). For the cell to function normally, GSH is
      critical to protect itself against ROS generated during activity
      of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Alcohol consumption
      rapidly depletes GSH levels; alcohol interferes with Cytochrome c
      to leak from the mitochondria into the cytosol, which can activate
      enzymes known as caspases that can trigger apoptosis.<br>
      <br>
      ROS induces LPO [ROS reacting with Malondialdehyde (MDA),
      4-hydroxy nonenal (HNE)] and recognized as important starting
      place of hepatocytes damage. Endotoxin-activated Kupffer cells
      affects mitochondria leading to release of ROS (hydrogen peroxide
      radical, hydroxyl radical, particularly superoxide radical) and
      several cytokines (viz., Tumour necrotic factor {TNF-Î±}) leading
      to hepatocytes necrosis and apoptosis. It has been established by
      clinical studies that patients with alcoholic liver disease have
      increased levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and
      TNF-Î± as well as the chemokine IL-8 and other cytokines.<br>
      <br>
      Alcohol might enhance the sensitivity of hepatocytes, consequently
      which could lead to an increased production of ROS in the
      mitochondria. ROS could activate a regulatory protein called
      nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB), which plays critical role in
      regulation of immune response and controls the activities of
      numerous genes, including those that expresses TNF-Î± &amp; its
      receptor as well as genes encoding proteins that promote
      apoptosis. Thus, a vicious cycle would be established in the
      hepatocytes: TNF-Î± promotes ROS production, which in turn
      activates NFÎºB, leading to enhanced production of additional TNF-Î±
      and its receptor as well as to production of factors that promote
      apoptosis. This cycle eventually alters the structure of the
      hepatocytes, impairs their function, and can lead to hepatocyte
      apoptosis. TNF-Î± also facilitates hepatocyte regeneration by
      promoting the proliferation [(Wheeler M. D. Alcohol Res Health,
      2003; 27, 300), (Molina P., Happel, K. I., Zhang P., Kolls J. K.,
      Nelson S., Focus on: alcohol and the immune system. Alcohol Res.
      Health, 2010, 33 (1 &amp; 2), 97)1)].<br>
      <br>
      TGF-Î² (transforming growth factor beta) might be involved in the
      development of alcohol-induced liver damage, which could cause the
      hepatocytes to produce molecules like trans-glutaminase,
      cytokeratins that are normally responsible for giving the cells
      their shapes. In excess, these molecules are cross-linked to form
      microscopic structures called Mallory bodies, which are markers of
      alcoholic hepatitis. TGF-Î² can also contribute to liver damage by
      activating stellate cells. In a normal state, these cells
      primarily serve to store fat and vitamin A in the liver. When
      activated, stellate cells produce collagen, the major component of
      scar tissue it leads to the development of liver fibrosis. Alcohol
      might trigger the activation of TGF-Î² and thereby contribute to
      the initiation of apoptosis if this molecule enters the blood in
      higher concentrations (Wheeler M. D., Alcohol Res. Health, 2003;
      27, 300).<br>
      <br>
      Acetaldehyde or ROS with DNA or protein or protein building blocks
      and ROS with MDA or MAA (mixed MDA-acetaldehyde-protein adduct) or
      HNE etc. in the cell could form stable or unstable adduct, which
      could be carcinogenic, immunogenic, induce inflammatory process,
      damage to the mitochondria etc. [(Zakhari, S. Alcohol Research
      &amp; Health, 2006, 29 (4)245); (D. Wu, Alcohol Research &amp;
      Health, 2106, 27, 4, 277); (Wheeler M. D., Alcohol Res. Health,
      2003; 27, 300); (Molina P., Happel K. I., Zhang P., Kolls J. K.,
      Nelson S., Focus on: alcohol and the immune system; (Alcohol Res.
      Health, 2010, 33, Vol. 1 &amp; 2, 97); (Neuman M. G.,
      Cytokine-central factor in alcoholic liver disease, Alcohol Res.
      Health, 2003, 27, 307)].<br>
      <br>
      Varieties of endogenous enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms
      have evolved to protect cells against ROS. This includes the
      superoxide dismutases (SOD), which remove O2&lt;âˆ’&gt;; Catalase
      (CAT) and the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) system, which remove
      H2O2 and non-enzymatic low-molecular-weight antioxidants such as
      reduced glutathione (GSH), Vitamin E, Vitamin C, Vitamin A,
      Ubiquinone, Uric acid, and bilirubin. But these are capable to
      protect the cells to limited extent. Additional protection could
      be achieved by orally administrating the glutathione precursor
      like S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAMe), N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or
      anti-oxidant like Vitamin E. Vitamin C, plant bioactives (gallic
      acid, quercetinete) etc. (D. Wu, Alcohol Research &amp; Health,
      2006, 27, 4, 277).<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention provides a beverage, more
      specifically an alcoholic beverage having reduced hepato-toxicity
      comprising distilled alcohol, deionized water, 18Î² or
      18Î±-Glycyrrhizin and a sugar alcohol or sugar and having pH in the
      range of 4.0-9.0. More particularly the hepato-toxicity is caused
      by the intake of alcohol. The reduced hepatotoxicity of the
      beverage of the present invention is achieved by the enhanced
      hepato-protective activity provided by the synergistic combination
      of 18Î² or 18Î±-Glycyrrhizin and a sugar alcohol or Glycyrrhizin and
      a sugar incorporated in the said alcoholic beverage. The
      synergistic effect of the components has been established by dose
      dependent study for hepato-protection of 18Î² or 18Î±-Glycyrrhizin,
      sugar alcohol and a combination of Glycyrrhizin and sugar
      alcohol/sugar by performing experiment on animal models.<br>
      <br>
      Ingredient Description:<br>
      <br>
      Glycyrrhizin (or Glycyrrhizic acid or Glycyrrhizinic acid:
      abbreviated as GA) is the chief sweet-tasting constituent of
      Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) root. It has also been given
      intravenously in Japan as a treatment for hepatitis C and as an
      emulsifier and gel-forming agent in foodstuff and cosmetics.
      Glycyrrhizin (GA) is a triterpenoid saponin glycoside. It is
      available as in racemic or pure form of 2 isomers:
      18Î²-Glycyrrhizin and 18Î±-Glycyrrhizin. Hepato-protective mechanism
      of GA is due to its aglycone, glycyrrhetic acid, which inhibits
      both free radical generation as well as lipid peroxidation. 18Î±-GA
      has anti-hepato fibrosis effectâ€”it is frequently used as a
      hepato-protective agent. The sweetness of GA has a slower onset
      than sugar, and lingers in the mouth for some time. GA is partly
      absorbed as an intact drug. (W. Xuyinga et. al.)
      Chemico-Biological Interactions 181 (2009) 15-19), (T, Zing et.
      al. Chinese Journal of Modern Applied Pharmacy 2006, 02, 15-19).
      GA and its metabolites exhibit steroid-like anti-inflammatory
      activity, due, in part, to inhibition of Phospholipase A2
      activity, an enzyme critical to numerous inflammatory processes.
      They inhibit hepatic metabolism of aldosterone and suppress
      hepatic 5-Î±-reductase. Because Cortisol and aldosterone bind with
      the same affinity to the mineralocorticoid receptor, an increase
      in renal Cortisol will result in a hyper-mineralocorticoid effect
      (Akamatsu, H. Planta Med., 1991, 57: 119-121), (Armanini, D.,
      Clin. Endocrinol. 1983, 19: 609).<br>
      <br>
      GA completely suppressed viral antigen expression possibly by
      causing a decrease in the negative charge on the cell surface
      and/or by decreasing the membrane fluidity thereby preventing
      Hepatitis A virus entry in cells by receptor mediated endocytosis
      (W. Xu-Yinga et. al., Chemico-Biological Interactions 181 (2009)
      15-19).<br>
      <br>
      GA induces phase II enzymes involved in the detoxification and
      excretion of carcinogenic or toxic substances and other
      antioxidant enzymes responsible for maintaining a balanced state
      between free radicals/oxidants and the antioxidants within the
      cellular environment. Oxidative injury in AR mice (Aldose
      reducrase deficient mice) is reduced by GA, by increasing GSH
      content and decreased MDA formation in a dose dependent manner.
      Concomitant decreases were observed in glutathione peroxidase
      (GPx), catalase (CAT), total antioxidant capacity (TAOC) and SOD
      activities in AR mice. IFN-Î±, or type II interferon, is a cytokine
      that is critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral
      and intracellular bacterial infections and for tumour control. GA
      led to a significant, increase of IFN-Î± level in medicine treated
      mice. IL-4 is a cytokine that induces differentiation of naive
      helper T cells (Th0 cells) to Th2 cells. Upon activation by IL-4,
      Th2 cells subsequently produce additional IL-4 (Xiao-Lan Li Int.
      J. Mol. Sci. 2011, 12, 905). GA could increase infection
      resistance as [monocyte chemo-attractant (chemotactic) protein-1]
      is a CC chemokine MCP-1 inhibitor (United States Patent
      Application 20060116337).<br>
      <br>
      The mice were treated intra-peritoneally with CCl4 (0.5 ml/kg).
      They received GA (50, 300, 200, 400 mg/kg) 24 h and 0.5 h before
      and 4 h after administering CCl4, This protection is likely due to
      the induction of heme oxygenase-1 and the down-regulation of
      pro-inflammatory mediators (Biol Pharm Bull. 2007, 30, 10, 11898).
      18Î±-GA could dose-dependently inhibits CCl4 induced liver
      fibrosis, by promoting the proliferation of hepatocytes, but
      inhibited that of Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) GA blocks the
      translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus; this could suppress the
      activation and induce the apoptosis of HSCs (Q Ying, Med Sci.
      Monit., 2012, 18, 1: BR24).<br>
      <br>
      GA was shown to attenuate histological hepatic changes and
      significantly reduced serum levels of AST, ALT, and lactic
      dehydrogenase (LDH), at all the indicated times. GA also
      significantly inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis by down-regulating
      the expression of caspase-3 and inhibiting the release of
      Cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytoplasm. The
      anti-inflammatory activity of GA may rely on the inhibition of
      release of tumour necrosis factor-Î±, myeloperoxidase activity, and
      translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B into the nuclei. GA also
      up-regulated the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen,
      implying that it might be able to promote regeneration of livers
      harmed by LPS. In summary, GA may represent a potent drug
      protecting the liver against endotoxin-induced injury, especially
      after massive hepatectomy (Brazilian journal of Medical and
      Biological Research, 2007, 40, 1637). Pretreatment with GA (50
      mg/kg) and the MMP inhibitor (5 mg/kg) suppressed increases in
      serum levels of ALT and AST in mice treated with LPS/Gal N due to
      a down-regulation of MMP-9 (J Pharm Pharmacol. 2008, 60, 1, 91).<br>
      <br>
      The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic
      abnormalities comprising visceral obesity, dyslipidaemia and
      insulin resistance (IR). Oral administration of 50 mg/kg of GA for
      one week could counteract the development of visceral obesity and
      improve dyslipidaemia via selective induction of tissue
      lipoprotein lipase (LPL), expression and a positive shift in serum
      lipid parameters respectively, and retard the development of IR
      associated with tissue steatosis (Lipids Health Dis. 2009, 29, 8,
      31).<br>
      <br>
      Diammoniumglycyrrhizinate (DG) protected mice against Concanavalin
      A (ConA)-induced elevation of serum ALT levels and apoptosis of
      hepatocytes; DG may possibly protect the liver from injury via two
      pathways: direct protection of hepatocytes from apoptosis through
      an IL-6 dependent way and indirect inhibition of T-cell-mediated
      inflammation through an IL-1 independent way (Int Immunopharmacol.
      2007 October: 7(10): 1292).<br>
      <br>
      Magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate 100 or 150 mg once daily, drugs are
      effective and safe treatment for chronic liver diseases (Zhoiighua
      Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi. 2009, 11, 847).<br>
      <br>
      A sugar alcohol is a kind of alcohol prepared from sugars. These
      organic compounds are a class of polyols, also called polyhydric
      alcohol, polyalcohol, or glycitol. They are white, water-soluble
      solids that occur naturally and are used widely in the food
      industry as thickeners and sweeteners. Sugar alcohols such as
      Mannitol, Erythritol, Sorbitol, Xylitol etc., which are chemically
      stable can be used as a radical scavenger (hydroxyl radical).
      Similarly, it has been found that compounds like Erythritol,
      Mannitol, Sorbitol, Xylitol etc. up-regulated different types of
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) like Cu/Zn-, Mn- and EC-SOD isozymes.
      In particular, the SOD activity of the erythritol-added group
      increased by 2-5 times. Further it is reported that diabetics have
      a low SOD activity due to the Maillard reaction, because the
      Maillard reaction remarkably causes a decrease in the SOD activity
      (US Patent Application 20100037353 A1). Mannitol containing
      hyperosmolar solution has been shown to protect ethanol-induced
      gastric mucosal damage (Gharzouli K, Exp. Toxic. Pathol., 2001;
      53: 175). Both rats and humans absorb and metabolize partially the
      Mannitol ingested in gastro intestinal tract (GIT). However,
      intestinal microflora convert Mannitol in to more absorbable form.
      In rat, absorbed mannitol is converted in to hepatic glycogen
      probably via fructose (J. Nutr. 1985, 115: 890). The mechanism of
      protecting living cells by Mannitol is not fully understood.<br>

      <br>
      For the establishment of synergism existing in the formulation of
      the present invention, markers/marker enzymes viz. SOD, Catalase,
      GPx, TNF-Î± were primarily taken into consideration for evaluating
      the % synergism. However, enzymes ALT, AST, ALKP and MDA were also
      analyzed to support the same.<br>
      <br>
      Reasons for Estimating ALT, AST, ALKP:<br>
      <br>
      Chronic misuse of alcohol changes marker enzymes of liver
      functions such as serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
      aminotransferase (AST, ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) and so
      these enzymes were studied.<br>
      <br>
      ALT and AST are found in hepatocytes but AST is also found in
      skeletal and myocardial cells. In alcohol related liver damage,
      the AST is elevated more than the ALT, at least in part as a
      reflection of alcohol related skeletal damage. This is the reverse
      of the normal pattern in acute hepatocellular disease (for example
      acute viral hepatitis) where the ALT exceeds the AST.<br>
      <br>
      ALKP is an enzyme in the cells lining the biliary ducts of the
      liver. ALKP levels in plasma will rise almost concomitantly with
      liver disease related with altered bile production and/or

      Reasons for Estimating Oxidative Stress Markers (MDA, Antioxidant
      Enzymes [SOD, CAT, Glutathione Peroxidase Etc.] Reduced
      Glutathione [GSH]):<br>
      <br>
      Alcohol metabolism in the liver results in the formation reactive
      oxygen species (ROS). Alcohol also stimulates the activity of
      cytochrome P450, which contribute to ROS production. Further,
      alcohol can alter the levels of certain metals in the body,
      thereby facilitating ROS production. Finally, alcohol reduces the
      levels of agents that can eliminate ROS (i.e., endogenous
      antioxidants). The resulting state of the cell, known as oxidative
      stress, can lead to cell injury. ROS production and oxidative
      stress in liver cells play a central role in the development of
      alcoholic liver disease.<br>
      <br>
      MDA (Malondialdehyde) is the end product of cell membrane lipid
      peroxidation. ROS degrade (oxidative degradation) polyunsaturated
      fatty acids of cell membrane resulting cell damage. The extent of
      lipid peroxidation can be well correlated with tissue MDA content.<br>
      <br>
      SOD (Superoxide dismutase) catalyzes the breakdown of the
      superoxide radical into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Liver cells
      are enriched with SOD as it is the major organ related with
      metabolism numerous substances.<br>
      <br>
      CAT (Catalase) catalyzes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide
      (H2O2) to water and oxygen. This enzyme is localized to
      peroxisomes in most eukaryotic cells.<br>
      GPx (Glutathione peroxidase) is the most abundantly available in
      the cytoplasm of most of the cells. It neutralizes hydrogen
      peroxide (H2O2) in presence of GSH.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      (GSH-reduced glutathione, GSSG-oxidized glutathione)<br>
      <br>
      GSH is the most abundant antioxidant in aerobic cells. GSH is
      critical for protecting the cells from oxidative stress, acting as
      a free radical scavenger and inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. (GSH
      also participates in the degradation of H2O2 by glutathione
      peroxidases (GPx). The ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to
      oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is an indicator of cellular health
      (status of cellular redox potential). In normal healthy conditions
      GSH constituting nearly 90% of cellular glutathione (i.e.,
      GSH/GSSG is around 9). However, the GSH/GSSG ratio is reduced in
      ROS related disorders.<br>
      <br>
      Reasons for Estimating Tumor Necrotic Factor Alpha (TNF-Î±):<br>
      <br>
      Alcohol consumption increases the translocation of endotoxins from
      intestine to portal circulation and interacts with Kuppfer cells
      (immunocytes) leading to secretion of several pro-inflammatory
      cytokines including tumor necrotic factor alpha (TNF-Î±).<br>
      <br>
      Based on the Above Description, we Identified Some Key Marker and
      Justify the Importance of the Parameter Chosen:<br>
      <br>
      SOD, Catalase &amp; GPx: In system SOD catalyzes the dismutation
      of superoxide to H2O2. GPx and Catalase then independently convert
      this H2O2 to water. SOD together with GPx and catalase form the
      main enzyme defense against harmful effect of ROS.<br>
      <br>
      GSH is the main endogenous antioxidant that protects cells from
      xenobiotics including alcohol. Alcohol is known to deplete GSH
      levels on the process to neutralize oxidants. Apart from this,
      endogenous glutathione-glutathione peroxidase system acts as an
      important antioxidants and cyto-protective machinery in the
      hepatocytes exposed to ethanol. Thus, depletion of cellular GSH
      level plays an important role in ethanol-mediated hepato-cellular
      dysfunction.<br>
      <br>
      The following tables (1 to 9) illustrate the % of
      hepato-protection of individual ingredients, combination of
      ingredients and the % synergism exhibited using respective
      combinations. All animal experiments were conducted for a period
      of one month by per oral administration of 2.5 g/kg dose of
      alcohol.<br>

      The data provided in the above tables clearly indicates that the
      18Î²-GA/D-Mannitol combination exhibits superior order of synergism
      over the combination of 18Î²-GA/D-Erythritol and 18Î²-GA/Xylitol
      combinations.<br>
      <br>
      The data provided in the above tables also indicates that overall
      the 18Î²-GA/D-Mannitol combinations exhibit almost similar order of
      synergism as that of 18Î±-GA/D-Mannitol combinations.<br>

      Alcohol Induced Sub-Acute Hepatotoxicity in Rats<br>
      <br>
      Male Wistar albino rats weighing 150-200 g are procured from local
      registered traders (CPCSEA Regd No. 1443/po/6/4/CPCSEA), Kolkata.
      India and were acclimatized for 7 days at standard housing
      condition (26Â° C.Â±2Â° C., 60-70% RH with 12Â±1 hours light and dark
      cycle). Animals were fed with commercially available diet (Upton
      India Pvt. Ltd, India) and water ad-libitum during the experiment
      period.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Example 1<br>
      <br>
      a) Model for Biological Testing<br>
      <br>
      Male Wistar albino rats weighing 150-200 g are procured and
      randomly divided into groups consisting of six animals in each
      group. Sub-acute toxicity is induced by alcohol in rats by oral
      administration of 25% alcohol (2.5 gm/kg/day, p.o.) for 28 days
      and this group served as the negative control and the positive
      control group received distilled water only.<br>
      <br>
      b) Preparation of Drug Solution<br>
      <br>
      All drug solutions were prepared in 15-40% aqueous alcohol,
      adjusting the pH in the range of 4.0-9.0 for evaluation of
      hepato-protective activity. This solution is further diluted with
      distilled water to obtain 25%, aqueous alcoholic solution and
      administered orally by gavage to different rats group of step (a).<br>
      <br>
      c) Evaluation of Hepato-Protective Activity<br>
      <br>
      On day 28thday the animals are anaesthetized with ether and blood
      samples are collected by cardiac puncture and the serum is used
      for the assay of marker enzymes viz. serum alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline
      phosphatase (ALP). The rats are sacrificed by exposure to an
      overdose of ether, immediately after the collection of blood;
      their livers are removed, washed in cold saline. Part of the liver
      is used for preparation of liver homogenate in phosphate buffer
      (pH 7.4). The supernatant is used for the estimation of
      malondialdehyde (MDA), super oxide dismutase (SOD), catalase
      (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), and Glutathione peroxidase
      (GPx).<br>
      <br>
      Example 2<br>
      <br>
      D-Mannitol (0.5 g) is dissolved in aqueous alcohol (100 ml) to
      provide 0.5% solution. This solution is administered in several
      portions to one of the rats group of Example (1a). The
      administration is carried out over a period of 28 days; each day
      10 ml sample is diluted with 6 nil distilled water to make 25%
      aqueous alcoholic solution (16 ml) and fed orally (10 ml/kg/day).
