            grow crops with salt water<br>
            By&nbsp;Katie Scott </font></strong>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><br>
        A British company has created an irrigation system that can grow
        crops using salt water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dRHS
        irrigation system consists of a network of sub-surface pipes,
        which can be filled with almost any water, whether pure,
        brackish, salted or polluted. The system can even take most
        industrial waste-water and use it without the need for a
        purification process.</p>
      <p align="left">The pipes are made from a plastic that retains
        virtually all contaminants while letting clean water through to
        the plants' roots.</p>
      <p align="left">It was designed by Mark Tonkin of
        http://www.dti-r.co.uk Dsign Technology and Irrigation, which is
        based in Brighton. He says that once the pipes have been laid,
        the system will require little maintenance and therefore no
        significant costs. This is partly because it's fed by gravity
        from an elevated supply tank, and partly because water diffuses
        through the porous pipe walls, so there are no holes to get
        blocked up.</p>
      <p align="left">The farmer will occasionally have to lush the
        pipes to clean out salt crystals and dirt, but Tonkin says this
        is a simple process. </p>
      <p align="left">Since the water is delivered directly to the plant
        roots, there is much less wastage through evaporation and
        run-off than with traditional irrigation systems. According to
        the inventor, it is also impossible to over-water plants, as the
        system will only release more water as plants draw up clean
        water from the soil.</p>
      <p align="left">The dRHS system, which has been in development for
        ten years, was initially trialled in the UK using tomato plants,
        and has since been tried out in the US. The next trials will
        take place in Chile, Libya, Tanzania, Mauritius and Spain.
        Tonkin says 20,000 metres of pipe are on their way to the Middle
        East, where it will be tested with water that's more saline than
        sea water.&nbsp;The system has so far supported the growth of
        tomatoes, radishes, courgettes, peppers, lettuce, strawberries
        and beans as well as three different types of tree - cherry,
        olive and prosopis. The company is now trying to grow acacias,
        oaks and banana trees among others. </p>
      <p align="left">It has also won international recognition for its
        work, most recently at the international Water Technology Idol
        event in Switzerland, organised by [
        http://www.globalwaterintel.com ] Global Water Intelligence
        magazine and the&nbsp;[ http://www.idadesal.org ] International
        Desalination Association.</p>
      <p align="left">Christopher Gasson from Global Water Intelligence
        magazine says that the competition was a three-way tie last year
        but this year, the winner stood out. "The dRHS irrigation system
        addressed a bigger problem than the other technology that it was
        competing against," he said. "Agriculture water is where 70 per
        cent of water goes. By 2025 two thirds of the world's population
        will experience water shortages and so farming will be badly
        hit. "Salination is a huge problem. Already 97.5 per cent of the
        water in the world is salty, and this is becoming more of a
        problem as people in poor countries recycle water, sometimes
        leaving the soil with a salty crust. This system will help a
        lot." </p>

      <p align="center"><strong><font size="4">The dRHS™ Technology</font></strong></p>
      <p><br>
        The dRHS™ Irrigation technology works by a network of sub
        surface pipes being filled with water, almost any water.&nbsp;
        The water can be pure, brackish, salted or polluted.&nbsp; The
        system can even take most waste industrial water and use it
        directly without purification.</p>
      <p>Water diffuses through the pipe walls, there are no holes or
        emitters to become clogged or blocked, virtually all
        contaminants are retained within the pipes.</p>
      <p>There is no requirement for pressure, the system is gravity fed
        from a supply tank.</p>
      <p>Plants take water on demand but cannot become over watered.</p>
      <p>Plants take more water from the dRHS™ pipes as the soil dries
        out, less if the surrounding soil becomes wetter.</p>
      <p>The system is extremely water efficient, there is virtually no
        loss of water to evaporation or run-off.</p>
      <p>There is no limit to the extent of the system -- it can
        irrigate vast areas of land.</p>
      <p>There is no requirement for monitoring or planned irrigation
        events -- the plants take what water they want when they want it
        -- each plant in a row may require a different amount of water
        at a different time, the dRHS™ technology delivers this
        individuality.</p>
      <p>The dRHS™ technology is new and different, it requires a new
        approach and new techniques.</p>

        Abstract -- An irrigation system for irrigating a growing
        medium. The irrigation system comprises a corrugated tubular
        hydrophilic membrane or a helical tubular hydrophilic membrane
        which can be buried in a growing medium. The invention also
        relates to methods of irrigating said growing medium. The
        hydrophilic membrane can be a hydrophilic polymer based on a
        polyether.</p>
