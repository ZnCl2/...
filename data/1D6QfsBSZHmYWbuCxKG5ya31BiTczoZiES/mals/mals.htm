      <br>
      In February last year, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and
      transport company Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) announced plans to
      investigate the effectiveness of a system intended to reduce the
      frictional resistance between a vessel's bottom and the seawater
      using a layer of air bubbles. Now MHI has coupled the Mitsubishi
      Air Lubrication System (MALS) with a high-efficiency ship hull in
      the conceptual design for a container ship that the company claims
      would offer a reduction in CO2 emissions of 35 percent compared to
      conventional container carrier designs.<br>
      <br>
      To verify the CO2 reduction efficiency of MALS, MHI has installed
      it on the "YAMATAI," a module carrier operated by an NYK
      subsidiary. A module carrier was chosen as the first permanent
      installation of the system because they have a shallow-draft hull
      that generates relatively low water pressure, which minimizes the
      amount of electricity required by an air blower to supply air to
      the vessel's bottom. Additionally, the flat, wide bottom is able
      to better retain the supplied air under the vessel's bottom.<br>
      <br>
      With MHI expecting to see a reduction in CO2 emissions of around
      10 percent on the YAMATAI thanks to MALS, the company is already
      looking ahead to the second application of the technology with the
      completion of the conceptual design of the "MALS-14000CS," a New
      Panamax size 14,000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent) container vessel.
      New Panamax refers to the size limit of ships that will be able to
      travel through the Panama Canal after the completion of its
      planned expansion in 2014 - specifically, ships with an overall
      length of 366 m (1,200 ft), width of 48.8 m (160 ft) and tropical
      freshwater draft of 15.2 m (49.8 ft).<br>
      <br>
      Other environmentally friendly features include a Sox scrubber to
      remove sulfur oxide from flue gas, and a ballast water treatment
      system.<br>
      <br>
      This isn't the first time a layer of air has been proposed as a
      way to reduce the friction between a ship's hull and the water.
      While MALS creates a layer of air bubbles by pumping air to the
      vessel's bottom, researchers are also looking at developing
      superhydrophobic surfaces modeled on the water fern salvinia
      molesta, which is able to remain completely dry when submerged by
      trapping a layer of air on the surface of its leaves using tiny
      hairs. Combining MALS with such a surface would mean the air
      wouldn't need to be pumped continually to the bottom of the
      vessel.<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, Wired has reported that grain conglomerate Archer
      Daniels Midland has ordered three dry bulk carriers that will be
      built with MALS.<br>

        Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System (MALS) is our original system
        which saves energy and reduces CO2 emissions.<br>
        <br>
        By covering the ship's bottom like a carpet, with fine bubbles
        blown from the ship's bottom using a blower, the system reduces
        frictional resistance between the ship hull and seawater as the
        ship cruises.<br>
        <br>
        With its energy-saving benefit for heavy cargo ships already
        verified, MALS is scheduled for installation on grain carriers
        and passenger ships. MHI will further boost its efficiency by
        applying our original highly-efficient blower, positioning an
        efficient airblowing outlet, calculated based on a leading-edge
        fluid dynamics simulation, and optimizing the blowing air
        volume.<br>

      <b>Conclusion<br>
      </b><br>
      The air bubble distribution on the hull surface of a ship with the
      Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System (MALS) and the amount of air
      bubbles flowing into the propeller were roughly predicted using a
      model-scale analysis. The results confirmed that the air bubble
      distribution on the ship bottom surface varied little in response
      to changes in the air bubble diameter. The experimental results
      were qualitatively similar to the air bubble distribution
      predicted by CFD. We confirmed that changes in the bubble diameter
      did not affect the peak position of the void fraction on the
      propeller disk area, while the void fraction of air bubbles
      flowing into the propeller increased as the air bubble diameter
      decreased. Comparison of the calculated and experimental results
      confirmed that the loss of propulsive efficiency due to air
      bubbles was negligible because the air bubbles flowed along the
      ship bottom toward the area above the propeller.<br>
      <br>
      However, the resistance reduction mechanism of the air lubrication
      method have not yet been thoroughly examined, including the causes
      and effects of changes in fluid density and the turbulence
      modulation effects of air bubbles inside the boundary layer. CFD
      will play an important role in determining these causes by
      providing a detailed understanding of the physical phenomena.<br>

            Works?</b></big><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Raunek</b></div>
      <br>
      <br>
      When Mitsubishi came out with their Air Lubrication System, it was
      just one of the several energy saving techniques for ships. The
      Mitsubishi Air Lubrication System <br>
      <br>
      (MALS) was the first system of its kind which promised energy
      saving and emission reduction from ships using the innovative
      technology of Air Lubrication.<br>
      <br>
      However, the shipping industry soon realized the potential of the
      technology, and soon, big players such as NYK Group of Companies
      and Damen Shipyards Group introduced their own research and
      experiments on the same.<br>
      <br>
      According to DNV, one of the world’s leading classification
      societies, Air Bubble Lubrication System is one of the promising
      technologies which will help ships to improve their efficiency and
      reduce energy losses.<br>
      <br>
      What is Air Lubrication System for Ships?<br>
      <br>
      Air Lubrication System is a method to reduce the resistance
      between the ship’s hull and seawater using air bubbles.&nbsp; The
      air bubble distribution across the hull surface reduces the
      resistance working on the ship’s hull, creating energy-saving
      effects. With the right ship hull design, the air lubrication
      system is expected to achieve up to 10-15% reduction of CO2
      emissions, along with significant savings of fuel.<br>
      <br>
      How does Air Lubrication System works?<br>
      <br>
      The Air Lubrication System works on the simple principle of
      trapping a layer of air bubbles beneath the ship’s hull. An air
      blower or a dedicated system is used to generate air bubbles to
      pass them continuously beneath the ship’s surface. Air bubble
      outlets are created at different locations along the bottom of the
      hull, symmetrically on both the sides of the ship’s center line.<br>
      <br>
      The air is blown at a constant rate to form a layer of bubbles,
      which reduces the drag and resistance between the ship and the
      seawater to continuously replenish the lost air bubbles ensures
      that a uniform layer of air bubbles is maintained beneath the ship
      and the desired effect is produced.<br>
      <br>
      Concerns about Air Lubrication System<br>
      <br>
      Though a promising technology, the Air Lubrication System has a
      few concerns regarding its implementation and performance on
      ships. Some of the main ones are:<br>
      <br>
      The Air Lubrication System (ALS) until now can only be used for
      certain types of ships having flat bottoms. Ships having V-shaped
      hulls, such as certain warships or recreational vessels might not
      be able to reap the benefits of the air lubrication system.<br>
      <br>
      To trap the layer of bubbles beneath the ship’s hull is a
      challenging task. Though solution such as protruding ridges at the
      edges of the hull can help in trapping the blanket of bubbles, the
      sucking effect of propeller on the bubbles is difficult to defy.
      Another solution is to design the ship’s stern or hull in such a
      way that it traps the air bubbles beneath the hull. However, this
      would substantially increase the building cost of the ship.<br>
      <br>
      It is also feared that the air cavities made for trapping the air
      bubbles would affect the handling and stability of the ship at the
      sea. If true this can cause difficulty to the ship and the crew
      especially in rough seas.<br>
      <br>
      The air bubbles leaving the hull surface flow into the ship’s
      propeller. This can influence the efficiency, noise, and vibration
      of the propeller. Though according to the experiments conducted by
      Mitsubishi there were negligible effects of air bubbles on the
      propeller, rough seas and changes in fluid density can produce
      unfavorable results.<br>
      <br>
      In order to obtain the desired effect, it is important that air
      bubbles are of uniform size and are evenly distributed beneath the
      hull surface. Moreover, a change in air bubble diameter would
      drastically affect the air bubble distribution beneath the hull.
      An arrangement is therefore necessary to ensure that the bubbles
      are of the same diameter (if possible) and are well distributed
      beneath the ship’s hull.<br>
      <br>
      Bulk Carrier With MALSAs far as the MALS is concerned, the company
      claims that along with a high-efficiency ship hull, a container
      ship fitted with their air lubrication system can offer reduction
      in CO2 emission of up to 35% as compared with conventional
      container ships. Recent findings has also supported the claim that
      substantial fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions is
      possible through Air lubrication system when combined with other
      promising green ship technologies. <br>
      <br>
      Air Lubrication System is now a technology which is well proved to
      provide benefits such as reduced carbon emissions and substantial
      fuel savings. With rising fuel prices and increasing pressure to
      make ships greener, shipping companies are now implementing
      promising technologies that would help them reduce carbon
      emissions and improve ship inefficiency. According to reports,
      companies such as AIDA Cruise ships along with few other shipping
      companies have already confirmed of plans to implement Air
      Lubrication Systems on their ships.<br>

          </b><b> DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b> </b>[0024] Hereinafter, embodiments of the present
          invention will be described in detail with reference to the
          attached drawings. FIG. 1 is a side view of a ship to which an
          air recovering apparatus, an air lubrication system and a ship
          modifying method according to an embodiment of the present
          invention are applied. FIG. 2 is a bottom view when the ship
          is viewed from a ship bottom side. A bow 2 of a hull 1 is
          drawn on a right side, and a stern 3 is drawn on a left side.
          A propeller 5 and a helm 6 are arranged below a water line on
          the side of the stern 3. An air ejecting device 7 is arranged
          on a side closer to the bow 2 in a ship bottom 4. An air
          recovering device 8 is arranged on a side closer to the stern
          3 of the ship bottom 4.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] The air ejecting device 7 contains ejecting side
          chambers 9 arranged on the ship bottom 4, a pipe system 10 and
          a compressor 11. A blower may be used instead of the
          compressor 11. The compressor 11 ejects the air inside the
          pipe 10 to the direction of the ship bottom 4. One end of the
          pipe 10 is connected to an air supply hole (that will be
          described later) formed in an outer plate of the ship bottom
          4. The ejecting side chamber 9 is attached to the ship bottom
          4 in a position in which the air supply hole is formed, by
          welding or tightening bolts. The air inside the pipe 10 is
          supplied to the ejecting side chamber 9 by the compressor 11.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The air recovering device 8 contains recovery side
          chambers 12 and a pipe 13. One end of the pipe 13 is connected
          to an air recovery hole (that will be described later) formed
          in the outer plate of the ship bottom 4. The recovery side
          chamber 12 is attached to the ship bottom 4 in a position in
          which the air recovery hole is formed, by welding or
          tightening bolts. The air inside the recovery side chamber 12
          is discharged through the pipe 13 to the outside or again
          supplied to the pipe 10 on the side of the air ejecting device
          7.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] In examples of FIGS. 1 and 2, a plurality of (three)
          ejecting side chambers 9 are attached. An ejecting side
          chamber 9a on a front side is attached on a central line CL of
          the hull 1, to be line-symmetry with respect to the central
          line CL. One of ejecting side chambers 9b on a rear side is
          attached to a position shifted on the starboard side 14 in
          parallel with the ejecting side chamber 9a on the front side.
          The other is attached to a position shifted to the port side
          15 in parallel with the ejecting side chamber 9a on the front
          side. Accordingly, the ejecting side chambers 9b on the rear
          side are formed symmetrically with respect to the central line
          CL.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] In examples of FIGS. 1 and 2, a plurality of recovery
          side chambers 12 are attached in correspondence to the
          ejecting side chambers 9. The recovery side chambers 12a and
          12b on the rear side and the front side are attached in
          correspondence to the ejecting side chambers 9a and 9b on the
          front side and the rear side. Each of the recovery side
          chambers 12 has a shape similar to the ejecting side chamber 9
          and is provided to have an orientation opposite to a direction
          of the hull 1. As a result, the ejecting side chambers 9 and
          the recovery side chambers 12 are line-symmetrical with
          respect to a lateral reference line SL extending in a lateral
          direction of the hull 1.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] FIG. 3 schematically shows the operation of the air
          lubrication system. The air is supplied from the pipe 10 to
          the ejecting side chamber 9. The ejecting side chamber 9
          ejects the air as air bubbles 40 to external water. The air
          bubbles 40 flow to the stern 3 while covering the ship bottom
          4. Since the ship bottom 4 is covered with the air bubbles 40,
          friction between the hull 1 and the water is reduced. The air
          bubbles 40 are captured in the recovery side chamber 12 and
          recovered from the pipe 13. The air bubbles 40 are recovered
          on the side of the bow 2 from the propeller 5. Thus, it is
          possible to avoid the drop in a propulsion efficiency of the
          propeller 5 due to the air bubbles 40.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] FIG. 4 shows another configuration example of the
          ejecting side chambers 9. In the configuration shown in FIG.
          2, the air bubbles 40 that substantially cover the width of
          the ship bottom 4 are provided by the three ejecting side
          chambers 9. On the contrary, in FIG. 4, in addition to a group
          of three ejecting side chambers 12-1 that substantially covers
          the width of the ship bottom 4, a group of three ejecting side
          chambers 12-2 that has the similar configuration is further
          placed in a position away in a length direction of the hull 1.
          In this configuration example, a larger number of the air
          bubbles 40 can be supplied to the ship bottom 4. Or, when the
          air bubbles 40 easily escape from the left and right sides of
          the ship bottom 4, so that the air bubbles 40 supplied from
          the ejecting side chambers 12-1 come short on the side of the
          stern 3, the air bubbles 40 can be supplemented from the
          ejecting side chambers 12-2 of a next stage. In such a case,
          the air bubbles 40 can be recovered by placing a plurality of
          groups of recovering side chambers on the side of the stern 3
          line-symmetrically with a plurality of groups of ejecting side
          chambers 12-1, 12-2 and a group of recovery side chambers with
          respect to the predetermined reference line SL.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] The configuration of the ejecting side chamber 9 will
          be described below. FIG. 5 is a bottom view of the ejecting
          side chamber 9. FIG. 6 is a sectional view when the ejecting
          side chamber 9 is viewed from the side thereof. The right side
          in each of FIGS. 5 and 6 indicates the side of the bow 2. The
          ejecting side chamber 9 contains a flat portion 21, a front
          end 22, a rear end 23, a side plate 21-1 and a side plate
          21-2. The flat portion 21 is a plate-shaped member provided on
          the lower side of the ship bottom 4. The flat portion 21 is
          arranged in parallel to the ship bottom 4 or at a state almost
          parallel to the ship bottom 4.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] The front end 22 is a plate-shaped member for
          connecting the ship bottom 4 and the end of the flat portion
          21 on the bow 2 side. The front end 22 has a slope that
          approaches the ship bottom 4 toward the side of the bow 2, in
          order to decrease the resistance of water flow when the hull 1
          navigates forwardly. The rear end 23 is a plate-shaped member
          for connecting the ship bottom 4 and the end of the flat
          portion 21 on the side of the stern 3. The rear end 23 has a
          slope that approaches the ship bottom 4 toward the side of the
          stern 3, in order to suppress the generation of eddy that
          serves as resistance when the hull 1 navigates forwardly and
          further smoothly guide the air bubbles to the ship bottom 4.
          The side plate 21-1 closes an opening formed from the ship
          bottom 4, and the portside portion of each of the flat portion
          21, the front end 22 and the rear end 23. The side plate 21-2
          closes an opening formed from the ship bottom 4 and the
          starboard side portion of each of the flat portion 21, the
          front end 22 and the rear end 23. An air bubble chamber 28 is
          formed by the flat portion 21, the front end 22, the rear end
          23, the side plates 21-1 and 21-2 and the ship bottom 4
          covered with them. The space of the air bubble chamber 28
          communicates with the water under the ship through air
          ejecting holes 26 and also communicates with a pipe 10 through
          an air supply hole 27. The space of the air bubble chamber 28
          other than the air ejecting holes 26 and the air supply hole
          27 is closed.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] In the design of the ejecting side chamber 9, the air
          bubble chamber 28 is divided into an air scattering section 24
          as a region on the side of the bow 2, and an air ejecting
          section 25 as a region on the side of the stern 3, as shown by
          a dotted line on the flat portion 21 of FIG. 5. A plurality of
          the air ejecting holes 26 are formed in the air ejecting
          section 25. These air ejecting holes 26 are arranged in the
          width direction of the hull 1. In an example of FIG. 5, two
          lines of the air ejecting holes 26 are shifted to each other
          in a zigzag arrangement in the width direction of the hull 1.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] The air supply hole 27 is formed at that position of
          the ship bottom 4 opposite to the air scattering section 24
          which is differing from the air ejecting holes 26 (a position
          on the side of the bow 2 in FIGS. 5 and 6). One end of the
          pipe 10 is connected to the air supply hole 27. By the air
          scattering section 24, a predetermined distance is provided
          between the air supply hole 27 and the air ejecting holes 26
          in the longitudinal direction of the hull 1. The existence of
          this distance enables the air that is supplied from the air
          supply hole 27 to the air bubble chamber 28 is scattered and
          consequently enables the air bubbles of a substantially
          uniform quantity to be ejected into the water from the
          plurality of air ejecting holes 26 arranged in the width
          direction of the hull 1. In order to attain the effect of the
          air scattering section 24, for example, a distance between a
          center of the air supply hole 27 and a center of the air
          ejecting hole 26 is desired to be set longer than the width of
          the air bubble chamber 28.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] The air, which is supplied from the air supply hole 27
          to the air bubble chamber 28, is impinged on the upper surface
          (inner wall surface) of the flat portion 21 due to a pressure
          given by the compressor 11. The supplied air is changed into
          the fine air bubbles due to the pressure of this impingement,
          and the width of a distribution is easily widen. While the air
          bubbles are pushed toward a downstream side inside the air
          scattering section 24, its distribution is expanded in a width
          direction.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] Since the air scattering section 24 is provided, the
          width of the air supply hole 27 can be made smaller than the
          width of the air ejecting holes 26 in the width direction of
          the hull. In other words, by providing the air scattering
          section 24, the air ejecting holes 26 can be formed to be
          distributed in the width direction of the hull 1, even when
          the number of air supply holes 27 is small (one in an example
          of FIG. 5). Thus, the air bubbles 40 can be ejected to have a
          substantially uniform distribution in the width direction.
          Accordingly, when the ship is modified to install the air
          lubrication system later, the work may be reduced when the air
          supply hole 27 and the pipe 10 are attached to the hull 1.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] A diffusion member can be further added to the ejecting
          side chamber 9 to diffuse the air bubbles. For example, a
          porous plate is provided between the air supply hole 27 and
          the air ejecting holes 26 to partition the air bubble chamber
          28 in the longitudinal direction of the hull 1. Consequently,
          the finer air bubbles can be supplied to the air ejecting
          holes 26.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] When a certain quantity of air bubbles are accumulated
          inside the air bubble chamber 28, the air bubbles 40 are
          ejected into the water under the ship bottom 4 from the air
          ejecting holes 26. When the ship sails, the hull 1 moves in
          the forward direction against the water. The water flow has a
          main direction from the front end 22 of the ejecting side
          chamber 9 to the rear end 23 on the ship bottom 4. On the
          contrary, since the inner space of the ejecting side chamber 9
          is relatively closed, the flows of the water and air in the
          air bubble chamber 28 are slow, as compared with the external
          water flow. For this reason, when the air is ejected from the
          air bubble chamber 28 through the air ejecting holes 26, the
          air is sheared into the finer air bubbles 40 by shearing force
          of the external water flow and sent to the downstream side.
          Since a time period for which the air bubbles 40 stay on the
          ship bottom 4 is long, the high air lubrication effect is
          attained. In this way, without being supplied in its original
          state to the ship bottom 4, via the rear end 23 and the like,
          the air from the air supply hole 27 once stay in the air
          bubble chamber 28, and then the air is supplied to the outside
          so that the shearing force acts against the air. Thus, the air
          bubbles 40 suitable for the air lubrication are obtained.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] Through the design of the shape of the air ejecting
          hole 26, the air bubbles 40 can be ejected more smoothly from
          the air bubble chamber 28 into water flows whose speeds are
          different in the longitudinal direction of the hull 1. In an
          example of FIG. 5, each of the air ejecting holes 26 has an
          oval shape long in the main direction of the flow, namely, in
          the longitudinal direction of the hull 1. The air bubbles 40
          ejected from the air ejecting holes 26 rise along the rear end
          23 and flow to the side of the stern 3 while covering the ship
          bottom 4, and then arrives at the recovery side chamber 12.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] The structure of the recovery side chamber 12 will be
          described below. FIG. 7 is a bottom view of the recovery side
          chamber 12. FIG. 8 is a sectional side view of the recovery
          side chamber 12. The right side of each of FIGS. 7 and 8 is
          the side of the bow 2. The recovery side chamber 9 has the
          structure similar to the ejecting side chamber 9, and this is
          attached to the ship bottom 4 in an opposite orientation in
          the longitudinal direction of the hull 1. The recovery side
          chamber 12 contains a flat portion 31, a front end 32, a rear
          end 33 and side plates 31-1 and 31-2. The flat portion 31 is a
          plate-shaped member provided under the lower side of the ship
          bottom 4 and is provided in parallel to the ship bottom 4 to
          have a gap.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] The front end 32 is a plate-shaped member to connect
          the ship bottom 4 and the end of the flat portion 31 on the
          side of the bow 2. The front end 32 has a slope that
          approaches the ship bottom 4 toward the side of the bow 2, in
          order to decrease the resistance of the water flow when the
          ship sails. The rear end 33 is a plate-shaped member to
          connect the ship bottom 4 and the end of the flat portion 31
          on the side of the stern 3. The rear end 33 has a slope that
          approaches the ship bottom 4 toward the side of the stern 3,
          in order to suppress the generation of the eddy that serves as
          the resistance when the hull 1 sails. The side plates 31-1 and
          31-2 close side openings by the right and left sides of the
          recovery side chamber 12, similarly to the side plates 21-1
          and 21-2 of the ejecting side chamber, and thus, the air
          bubble chamber 38 is formed. The air bubble chamber 38 has a
          space which communicates with the water under the water
          surface when the ship floats, through air intake holes 36 and
          also communicates with the pipe 13 through an air recovery
          hole 37, and a portion of the air bubble chamber 38 other than
          them is closed. The recovery side chamber 12 having such a
          structure can be attained by providing the ejecting side
          chamber 9 on the ship bottom 4 in an opposite orientation in
          the longitudinal direction of the hull 1.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] In the design of the recovery side chamber 12, the flat
          portion 31 is divided into an air intake section 34 as a
          region on the side of the bow 2, and a pushing pressure
          generating section 35 as a region on the side of the stern 3,
          as shown by a dotted line on the flat portion 31 of FIG. 7. A
          plurality of the air intake holes 36 are formed in the air
          intake section 34, similarly to the air ejecting holes 26 of
          the ejecting side chamber 9.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] The air recovery hole 37 is formed on at a position of
          the ship bottom 4 opposite to the pushing pressure generating
          section 35. One end of the pipe 13 is connected to the air
          recovery hole 37. By the pushing pressure generating section
          35, the air bubble chamber 38 can be provided to have a
          certain degree of a volume. The air bubbles acquired from the
          air intake holes 36 stay in the air bubble chamber 38. Since
          the air bubbles once stay in the pushing pressure generating
          section 35, the air of some quantity is accumulated in the air
          bubble chamber 38. As a result, the air bubbles can be
          smoothly recovered from the air recovery hole 37.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] In order to suppress the resistance of the water, the
          thickness of the recovery side chamber 12 is desired to be
          thin. When the length of the pushing pressure generating
          section 35 is set long, the sufficient volume of the air
          bubble chamber 38 can be attained even if the recovery side
          chamber 12 is thin. For this reason, for example, similarly to
          the ejecting side chamber 9, a distance between the center of
          the air intake hole 36 and the center of the air recovery hole
          37 is desired to be set longer than the width of the air
          bubble chamber 38.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] By providing a guide plate 39 in the recovery side
          chamber 12, it is possible to smoothly acquire the air bubbles
          40. The guide plate 39 is provided inside the recovery side
          chamber 12 to overlap with the air intake holes 36 when
          viewing from the lower side. The guide plate 39 is provided to
          approach the ship bottom 4 in a direction from the side of the
          bow 2 to the side of the stern 3 in an inclined state. By the
          guide plate 39, the air bubbles 40 acquired from the air
          intake holes 36 are smoothly sent to the pushing pressure
          generating section 35.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] FIGS. 9 and 10 are a bottom view and a sectional view
          which show the recovery side chamber in a modification example
          of the present embodiment. In the modification example, the
          recovery side chamber 12 contains a narrowing section 41 at
          the end thereof on its downstream side. In the narrowing unit
          41, the width of the recovery side chamber 12 is narrowed to
          be gradually reduced toward the downstream side. More
          preferably, the narrowing section 41 is structured by a plate
          material which approaches the ship bottom 4 toward the
          downstream side, similarly to the rear end 33 in FIG. 8. The
          air recovery hole 37 is provided at an upper portion above the
          narrowing section 41 in the vertical direction. By such a
          structure, the air bubbles recovered in the air bubble chamber
          38 are easily collected in the narrowing section 41, and the
          air bubbles can be recovered more efficiently from the air
          recovery hole 37.<br>
          <br>
          [0047] When the existing ship is modified to install the air
          lubrication system in the present embodiment, the air supply
          hole 27 and the air recovery hole 37 are formed in the ship
          bottom 4. The pipe 10, the pipe 13 and the compressor 11 are
          provided within the ship. The ejecting side chambers 9 and the
          recovery side chambers 12 are provided in the ship bottom 4.
          In this way, it is possible to improve the efficiency of the
          navigation of the existing ship. Even when the air lubrication
          system in the present embodiment is installed for a ship to be
          newly manufactured, the air lubrication system can be
          installed under few design changes, in accordance with the
          similar procedure.<br>
          <br>
          [0048] The structure of the air lubrication system in the
          present embodiment is effective in case of using only the air
          recovering device 8. For example, similarly to the
          newly-manufactured ship that contains the air lubrication
          system, an inner installation type ship is employed in which
          the chamber for ejecting the air bubbles is formed inside the
          hull 1 and the recovery side chamber 12 is attached from the
          outside. Even in this case, the same effect as the present
          embodiment can be attained in the air recovering device 8.<br>

      SOLUTION: The air lubrication system 1 for ships includes an air

      supply device 11 pressurizes the air to blow the air against water
      pressure. The temperature of the air at the outlet of the air
      supply device is high. If the high-temperature air is blown into
      the water without cooling it, deterioration of the coating film on
      the surface of the ship body may be accelerated. The air cooler 12
      cools the air using seawater. ;<br>
