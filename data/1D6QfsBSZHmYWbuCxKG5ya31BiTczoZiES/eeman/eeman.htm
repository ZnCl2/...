      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>I. The Central Theme</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This term refers to therapeutic
        effects obtained by applying wire circuits to connect one part
        of a person's body with another part, or to connect a area of
        one person's body with an area of another persons body. L.E.
        Eeman, in his exhaustive research into this type of circuit as
        detailed in his book Co-Operative Healing, utilized these
        connections in pairs so that there would be complete electrical
        circuit. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The basis of the flow effects
        obtained by use of these circuits, was the discovery that human
        bodies give evidence of being bipolar, along three axes : ---
        Head to feet; Right side to left; Back to front. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When polar opposites are connected
        together, whether within one body or between two or more bodies,
        the effects noted include greater relaxation, recovery from
        fatigue and disease, greater capacity for work, better health in
        general. Circuits connecting polar opposites are termed
        Relaxation Circuits. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When polar similar are connected
        together, the effects noted are the creation of tension, and th
        opposites of all the advantages obtained from Relaxation
        Circuits. Circuits connecting polar similars are termed Tension
        Circuits. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The use of these circuits have been
        found to affect not only functional physical and mental
        conditions but also organic conditions. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In people born right-handed, the
        head and right side have been found to have the same polarity,
        which by convention has been termed positive. In these
        individuals, the base of the spine, and the left hand share the
        same polarity. Polarities are reversed in those born
        left-handed. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Eeman and coworkers performed
        thousands of carefully documented experiments under controlled
        conditions over a period of years, establishing the effects of a
        wide variety of these circuits, ad ruling out the possibility of
        effects through suggestion or other extraneous influences. For
        more detail, see his book <i>Co-Operative Healing</i> (London
        1947, Frederic Muller Ltd). </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>2.&nbsp; One Person In Circuit</b>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The diagram (Fig 1) shows the
        circuit. Two metal handles each connect through approximately 10
        ft of insulated copper wire, to copper screen mats about a foot
        square. The individual lies on his back with the copper mats
        under his head and base of spine. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="g1.jpg" height="545" width="491"></p>
      </center>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For right-handed individuals, a
        relaxation circuit is formed if the left hand holds the handle
        connecting to the mat under the head, an the right hand holds
        the handle connected with the at under the bottom of the spine.
        Average duration of exposure is half an hour. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Likewise for right-handed
        individuals, if the handles are switched so that the left hand
        holds the handle connecting to the mat under the bottom of the
        spine, and the right hand holds the handle connecting to the mat
        under the head, a tension circuit is formed. These effects are
        noted even if the individual is not aware of the specific
        connections or if the connections are changed out of range of
        his vision and without his knowledge. One of the reasons for the
        10-ft length of connection wires, is to permit changes of
        connection without the subject's knowledge, is to permit changes
        of connection without the subject's knowledge, in order to test
        the effect of suggestion. In almost all instances, the reactions
        are those appropriate to the circuit rather than to the
        suggestion given, if the suggestion is contrary to the effect of
        the circuit. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Many case reports covering various
        types of ailments are detailed in the book <i>Co-Operative
          Healing</i>, and will not be repeated here. Among the ailments
        relieved by these circuits are listed: mental, nervous,
        circulatory, respiratory, digestive and eliminative disorders;
        headaches, high blood pressure, rheumatism, lumbago sciatica and
        many other conditions. Insomnia appeared particularly to be
        relieved. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Eeman states: </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">'The relaxation circuit almost
        invariably produces a progressive sense of muscular relaxation,
        warmth, well-being and drowsiness, often culminating in sleep,
        slower and stronger pulse, slower and fuller respiration, with
        more complete deflation, progressively longer pauses between
        deflations and inflations, and a lowering of the pitch of the
        voice.' </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The Tension Circuit reverses the
        above reactions and eventually leads to varying degrees of
        tension, restlessness and discomfort. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It was found that direct contact
        between the copper mats and the individual was not necessary in
        order to produce the effects noted; clothing and even cushions
        did not act as barriers. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>3. Two Persons in Circuit</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The effects of both Relation and
        Tension Circuits are usually increased f two persons are
        connected with each other, using a separate pair of copper mats
        for each person. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The normal Relaxation Circuit is
        formed when the head of each person is connected to the left had
        of the other person, and the bottom of the spine f each person
        is connected to the right hand of the other person. See Fig 2. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="g2.jpg" height="506" width="575"></p>
      </center>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It was found that sex made no
        difference in polarity --- the same circuit being applicable to
        two men, two women, or one man and one man. However, left- and
        Right-handedness does make a difference in polarity. When a
        right-handed person is placed in circuit with a left-handed
        person, then the Relaxation circuit if formed when the head of
        each person connects with the right hand of the other person,
        and the bottom of spine of each person connects with the left
        hand of the other person. Also, the left-handed person should
        lie in the opposite direction from the right-handed one. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Reports from the experiments
        indicate the rather curious fact that when a strong or well
        person is placed in circuit with a weak or ill person, both
        experience beneficial effects from the experience. Sleep for
        half an hour o more will frequently visit both subjects. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Another interesting fact that
        emerged from the tests, is that a Tension Circuit tends to
        produce discord and antagonism between the two participating
        subjects, and this antagonism is then dissipated if a Relaxation
        circuit is used. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>4. Three or More Persons in
          Circuit.</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The same principles were found to
        apply with three or more persons in circuit --- in fact the
        number of persons could be increased indefinitely. However, with
        the addition of more individuals in the circuit, additional
        phenomena appeared; some individuals turned out to be stronger
        'emittors', other individuals acted more as 'receivers', while
        others seems to have as the primary characteristic, that of
        being 'conductors'. For a detailed account of these
        characteristics, refer to Eeman's book <i>Co-Operative Healing</i>,
        Chapter IV. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Figure 3 shows a Relaxation Circuit
        between three individuals; the same circuit can be expanded to
        include any desired number. This is termed a 'series' type of
        circuit. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="g3.jpg" height="384" width="598"></p>
      </center>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For multiple use (three or more
        persons in circuit at one time), two principles emerged as the
        best ones to use --- diagrammed in Figs 4, 5 and 6. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In Fig 4, all the heads connect
        together all spines connect together, and those then are
        connected with each other, All right hands connect together, all
        left hands connect together, and those two sets are likewise
        connected with each other. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="g4.jpg" height="502" width="868"></p>
      </center>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In Figure 5, all heads and all left
        hands connect together, and all spines and all right hands
        connect together. </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="g5.jpg" height="513" width="807"></p>
      </center>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>5. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It would appear from the Eeman
        experiments, that human beings emit, emanate or radiate a
        particular kind of current or impulse, which can be channeled
        with wire connections and used to produce either healing effects
        or adverse effects, depending upon polarity. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><b>6. Drug Tests</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">One of the most interesting aspects
        of the Eeman research, was the series of tests in which a
        relaxation Circuit was established for one or several persons,
        and the circuit was broken by test vials placed in the circuit
        one at a time, each vial containing two electrodes immersed in a
        drug or medicinal solution. The vials were inserted out of range
        of the vision of the subjects, and they did not at any time have
        any knowledge of the names or characteristics of the test
        substances. Yet within a short time after the substance had been
        inserted, the subjects experienced physiological changes and
        symptoms, which almost always were representative of the effects
        engendered by the drug or substance used in the test. If the
        subjects were kept in circuit with a substance for too long a
        time, there were instances where the symptoms or physiological
        effects became very acute and severe. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Some of the tests were run with
        coded vials, so that the operator would not know what substance
        was in use at any given time, and so could not have had
        telepathic influence over the minds of the subjects. These
        tests, conducted to rule out the possibility of telepathic
        effect, proved just as positive in results as the tests
        conducted when the operator (though not the subjects) knew what
        substances were being tested. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Fig 6 shows a Relaxation Circuit of
        drug tests. </p>
      <center><img src="g6.jpg" height="447" width="764"></center>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The implications of these tests
        tend to confirm the hypothesis, previously stated by others,
        that all substances radiate and that these radiations can be
        carried on wires. </p>

        They can be used for fostering sleep, recovery from fatigue and

      <p>The relaxation circuit affects not only organic but also
        nervous and mental health. </p>
      <p>For experiments with one person, the handle in the left hand
        (-) s connected with a copper gauze screen beneath the head (+)
