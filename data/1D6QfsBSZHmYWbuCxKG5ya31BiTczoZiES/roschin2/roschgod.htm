        <p><b><font size="+2">Testing of Small Prototype to Investigate
              Searl's Effect</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">S. M. Godin and V.V. Roschin</font></b></p>

      <p>The authors go further in the research of possibility to
        receive free energy by means of rotating constant magnets
        (Searl’s Effect). </p>
      <p>The aim of generator compact model (GCM) testing was studying
        of possibility to produce a small and maximum cheap model, which
        uses the ceramic magnets. Laboratory research of this model of
        generator was aimed at the discovery of self-generation effects
        and effects of weight change, which were already achieved on the
        full-size generator [1]. </p>
      <p>A general view of GCM is shown in Figure 1. The generator
        represented a mechanical system consisting of general
        construction as a cylinder made of stainless steel divided by it
        height in approximately two equal parts. The direct current
        motor with collector was situated in the lower part; windings of
        stator and rotor were connected in series. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 1</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig1.jpg" height="322" width="235"></center>
      <p>In the upper part of the construction on the axis of motor the
        rotor is situated as a cylindrical ceramic magnet with a central
        hole made on the base of cobalt-samarium mix. The magnet is
        magnetized vertically and inserted into the steel fixture, which
        preserves the magnet from destruction during the quick rotation.
        Small magnetic rollers also made of ceramic magnets and
        magnetized along the axis of rotation were placed around the
        rotor. All 12 rollers were placed into the aluminum cylinders,
        which preserve their brittle ceramics from mechanical impact
        during the work in emergency conditions. The main idea of such
        construction consists in the fact that in initial state the
        rollers were attracted by the magnet of rotor to the side face.
        Due to the repulsion of the rollers from each other, the
        distance between them appeared automatically. With this distance
        they uniformly distributed along the entire perimeter of the
        rotor. During acceleration of the rotor the rollers diverge from
        the rotor step by step and begin to run in the outside
        cylindrical fixture, which is placed around the rotor at the
        distance of 1.5 mm from the external surface of rollers in the
        initial states. The height of the rotor magnet is 24 mm, the
        diameter of the inside hole is 40 mm. All other geometrical
        sizes and ratios are given in Figure 2. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 2</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig2.jpg" height="309" width="373"></center>
      <p>It was supposed that with a certain acceleration of rotation
        the rollers would begin to rotate inside the outside fixture
        with self-acceleration and would carry metal surface of rotor
        device. This mode will be easy to discover due to the possible
        decrease of the current consumed by the electric motor. Thus,
        the aim of GCM testing was an attempt to find the features of
        energy transformation of environment which lies in the
        self-acceleration of the rotor device or other characteristic
        effects concentric magnetic walls around the device and fall of
        temperature) discovered already. The program of device testing
        included registration of dependence of rotational speed of the
        rollers along the outside fixture from rotation speed of the
        motor. </p>
      <p>Appearance of GCM is shown in Figure 3, when this device is
        ready to test in laboratory conditions. GCM was placed on the
        massive grounded steel plate. The power supply made in the form
        of controlled transformer, isolating transformer, bridge diode
        rectifier and capacitive filter were placed on the right.
        Besides, the generator of reference frequency G3-112 and
        frequency meter C3-54 were placed here. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 3</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig3.jpg" height="353" width="350"></center>
      <p>The 2-channel oscilloscope C1-99, digital combined unit TSH300
        applied for the measurement of consumption current and power
        supply TEC-88 (0-30 V, 0-2.5 A) applied for power supply of the
        optoelectronic sensor of device rotation were placed on the
        left. The measurement of rotation speed of the rollers was made
        with an induction-type sensor, which was placed at the height of
        the rollers, on the reverse side of the aluminum fixture. The
        rollers after they separated from the rotor, rolled along this
        fixture. During the passing of every roller by the
        induction-type sensor, the impulse of voltage with the amplitude
        of about 1V was produced. This voltage was supplied to one of
        the inputs of 2-channel oscilloscope for direct observation on
        the screen. A signal from the reference generator connected with
        the frequency meter was supplied to the second input of the
        oscilloscope. </p>
      <p>Synchronization of scanning of the oscilloscope was provided
        from the same reference signal. The frequency of the signal on
        the reference generator was set to provide the most stable
        immovable pattern on both channels of the oscilloscope. An
        accurate measurement was made according to the data from the
        frequency meter. Such method of measurement was chosen because
        the applied collector motor of direct current ad permanent
        deviations of rotation rate due to the change of voltage in the
        mains, heating of bearings, collector and other reasons. All
        this hampered the reception of an accurate value of average
        rotation rate directly from the readings of the frequency meter.
        It was necessary to divide the readings of frequency meter by 12
        to receive the real value of rotation rate in rates per second
        (rate of running around the fixture) of the rollers. </p>
      <p>Measurement of rotation rate of the rotor was made in an
        analogous way, but as a sensor we used the self-made sensor on
        the base of optic pair IR emitter-receiver with an open optic
        channel. The sensor was assembled on the textolite baseplate and
        attached to the upper plexiglass head of GCM by means of usual
        plasticine. Using this sensor we could quickly and effectively
        adjust the necessary operating gap between the surface of
        optoelectronic couple and surface of special metal disk with 25
        dark and 25 light sectors applied on it. Thus, during one
        rotation period of the rotor the photon-coupled sensor gave 25
        impulses of voltage, which were transferred to the oscilloscope
        for immediate observation. The appearance of photon-coupled
        sensor or rotations attached to the upper plexiglass head of the
        GCM unit is shown in Figure 4. </p>
      <p><b>Figure 4</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig4.jpg" height="206" width="170"></center>
      <p>In Figure 5 you can see the oscillograms of signal from the
        photon-coupled sensor of rotation (upper beam) and harmonic
        signal from the reference generator in the moment of coincidence
        of frequencies with a one-phase accuracy. The real rotation rate
        of the rotor was determined as a measured frequency (rate) of
        generator divided by 25 (number of dark and light sectors on the
        disk of rate controller). </p>
      <p><b>Figure 5</b> </p>
      <center><img src="fig5.jpg" height="291" width="329"></center>
      <p>To receive reliable information on the characteristics of the
        electromechanical system ‘motor-permanent magnet of the rotor’
        there were made several bare measurements without installation
        of the rollers. Measurements were made with the placing of
        magnet north up and vice versa. </p>
      <p>As we can see from the diagrams of dependence of the motor
        consumption current from the applied voltage of power supply,
        the strength of consumption current increases with the voltage
        of power supply and reaches its maximum at 0.31 A with the
        minimal possible rotation rate of the rotor. The strength of
        consumption current does not depend on the polarity of
        installation of the magnet in the limits of experimental
        accuracy. For the given motor there is an area of minimal
        consumption current, which lies in the diapason from 40 to 80 W.
      </p>
      <p>We got similar curves of rotation speed for the cases of
        different location of magnets of the rotor, which means the
        independence of rotation speed from the polarity of the magnet
        of the rotor. </p>
      <p>The results of measurements of rotation speeds of the rotor and
        rollers (given separately) are presented in Table 1. </p>
      <p><b>Table 1</b> </p>
      <center><img src="table1.jpg" height="557" width="752"></center>
      <p>Here, as in the previous example, two cases are considered.
        They are the case, when the magnet was installed with its north
        pole up and an opposite case. The poles of the rollers change
        accordingly. We should note that with the slow change of power
        supply voltage, we practically always observed the instability
        of the trajectories of the rollers and their tailing from the
        operating surface, which led to the adhesion of one or some
        pairs of the rollers together. </p>
      <p>This fact distorted the pattern of measurements, and we had to
        introduce correction factors during the calculation of rotation
        speed of the rollers. These factors depend on the number of
        fallen down or adhered rollers in pairs. This table was made
        taking into account these correction factors and it is an
        average one according to the results of five tests. As we can
        see from the table, no self-acceleration of the rollers was
        found. After the speed reaches a particular value of 8.5 rps,
        the speed of the rollers stabilizes and does not increase in
        spite of the increase of rotation speed of the rotor magnet. </p>
      <p>Also we can see from Table 1 that the rollers always have a
        tendency to retard and after the full separation with the
        voltage of 20-23 V. </p>
      <p>Concerning the polarity of magnet location we can say that it
        does not influence the rotation speed of the rotor and rollers
        in the limits of miscalculation in determination of speed and
        voltage in the given experiment. Some differences in speed are
        defined only by mechanical characteristics of the rollers and
        surface o the fixture, which was used for revolving around. We
        should say that the outside surfaces of the rollers and the
        surface wer made of the same material (aluminum); that’s why
        they have a tendency of attrition even during one experiment (10
        minutes). Due to this reason we couldn’t get full reiteration,
        but the accuracy was sufficient to establish the fact of full
        absence of the self-acceleration effects and some differences
        between polarities of installation of the rotor magnet and
        rollers. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, we couldn’t find any anomalies in the
        temperature distribution and distribution of magnetic field
        around the converter. ‘Magnetic and heat walls’ discovered in
        experiments with a big converter were almost absent around the
        small device. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusion</b> </p>
      <p>These experiments proved the point of view that during the
        device operation the nonlinearity of the wave processes, which
        take place in quantum medium (ether) plays the main role. It is
        evident that there is some critical value of parameters in the
        magnetic system of the converter (mass, induction of magnetic
        field) and only in the case of excess of these parameters the
        appearance of abovementioned effects is possible. </p>

      <p><b>Editor’s Note:</b> -- Alexander Frolov --- I have to say
        about my personal opinion of this experimental work. It is a
        very strange project. I am not sure if these are 100% true
        experimental results due to absence of real prototype at the
        present time (Only the description of 7 KWt system was
        published, It was built in 1002, according to S, Godin). On the
        other hand, the theory of this energy converter and its
        description by Godin and Roschin is in good correlation with
        other theories on inner structure of physical vacuum. Faraday
        Lab Ltd will develop this research direction and we hope to
        present our own experimental results in the future. </p>
