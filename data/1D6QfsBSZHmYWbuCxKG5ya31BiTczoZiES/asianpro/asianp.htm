          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According
              to Hindu cosmology, the universe is cyclical, passing
              through four world ages. Each yuga, as they are called, is
              shorter and less pleasant than the previous epoch due to
              the degeneration of morality. Currently we are in the
              last, the Kala Yuga, in which dharma (correct behavior),
              is only one-fourth of its beginning quality. The Kala Yuga
              is only 4,320,000 years long. At its end, religion will
              disintegrate and society will become more secular. When
              the world becomes hopelessly degenerate, it will end in
              catastrophe and a new mahayuga ("great yuga") will begin.
              One thousand yugas is one day in the life of Brahma, the
              godhead of Hinduism. At the end of each day, the universe
              comes to an end and is resorbed into the Brahma for an
              equally long night, during which time it exists only
              potentially. He reappears at dawn, and creation begins
              anew. The present age is the first day of the 51st year of
              Brahma’s life. He lives 100 years, each of which comprises
              360 days and nights. Then he dies, and the universe is
              dissolved into nothingness that lasts for another cosmic
              century. Then he is reborn to live another 311,040 billion
              years.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Kali
              Yuga allegedly began in 3012 BC, so apparently we have
              many cosmic hours to wait for it to end; nevertheless,
              many people believe that the end is nigh. At that time,
              the Kalki (White Horse) Avatar, the tenth and final
              incarnation of Vishnu, will arrive. The heavens will open
              and he will appear on his white horse with his sword
              "blazing like a comet". He will destroy the wicked and
              restore purity. Entire continents will sink and rise in
              the process.</font> </p>

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
              eschatological Hindu text <i>Divya Maha Kala Jnana</i>
              ("The Divine Knowledge of Time") allegedly was composed
              circa 1000 AD by Jagas Guru Srimad Virat Potaluru Veera
              Brahmendra Maha Swami. The book describes social
              conditions before the arrival of Kali Purusha, the Kalki
              Avatar, by the Kali year 5101 (~ 1999 AD). That being is
              the incarnation of Kali, the destructive and procreative
              female aspect of Brahma. At that time, Kali Purusha will
              be called Sree Sree Sree ("Thrice Great") Veera Bhoga
              Vasataraya Maha Swami. The text <i>Kala Jnana</i> also
              describes the current world conditions of sexual
              perversion and horrid disasters that precede the end of
              this era of errors.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The <i>Vishnu




                Purana</i> (4: 24) advises us as follows about the
              conditions at the end of this civilization:</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The
              leaders who will rule over the earth will be violent and
              will seize the goods of their subjects. The caste of
              servants will prevail and the outcasts will rule. Short
              will be their lives, insatiable their appetites; they will
              hardly understand the meaning of piety. Those with
              possessions will abandon agriculture and commerce and will
              live as servants or following various possessions. The
              leaders, with excuses of fiscal need, will rob and despoil
              their subjects and take away private property. Moral
              values and the rule of law will lessen from day to day
              until the world will be completely perverted and
              agnosticism will gain the day among men.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The causes
              of devotion will be confined to physical well-being; the
              only bond between the sexes will be passion; the only road
              to success will be the lie. The earth will be honored for
              its material treasure only. The priestly vestments will be
              a substitute for the quality of the priest. A simple
              ablution will mean purification, the race will be
              incapable of producing divine birth. Men will ask: what
              authority have the traditional tests? Marriage will cease
              being a rite. Acts of devotion, however scanty, will not
              produce any result. Every way of life will be equally
              promiscuous for all. Those who own and spend more money
              will be the bosses of men who will have only one aim, the
              gaining of wealth however dishonestly. Every man will
              consider himself as good as a Brahmin. Men will be
              terrified of death and fear scarcity; by this alone they
              will keep up an outward appearance of religious feeling.
              Women will not obey the orders of their husbands or their
              parents. They will be selfish, abject, liars, fallen and
              given to evil ways. Their aims in life will be sensual
              satisfaction only..</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"When the
              practices taught by the Vedas and the institutes of law
              shall nearly have ceased, and the close of the Kali age
              shall be nigh, a portion of that divine being who exists
              of his own spiritual nature in the character of Brahma,
              and who is the beginning and the end, and who comprehends
              all things, shall descend upon the earth. He will be born
              as Kalki in the family of an eminent Brahmin of Sambhala
              village, endowed with the eight superhuman faculties. By
              his irresistible might he will destroy all the barbarians
              and thieves, and all whose minds are devoted to iniquity.
              He will then reestablish righteousness upon earth; and the
              minds of those who live at the end of the Kali age shall
              be awakened, and shall be as pellucid as crystal. The men
              who are thus changed by virtue of that peculiar time shall
              be as the seeds of human beings, and shall give birth to a
              race who shall follow the laws of the Krita age, the Age
              of Purity."</font> </p>

              conversation with Ananda, recorded in the text <i>Vinya
                Pitaka</i> (II: 253), the Buddha modified this prophecy,
              reducing the time by half:</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If,
              Ananda, women had not retired from the household life to
              the houseless one, under the doctrine and discipline
              announced by the Tathagata [another Buddha], Dharma would
              long endure; a thousand years would the good Dharma
              abide.&nbsp; But since, Ananda, women have now retired
              from the household life to the houseless one, under the
              doctrine and the discipline announced by the Tathagata,
              not long Ananada, will Dharma endure; but five hundred
              years, Ananda, until the Dharma abide".</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Chinese
              Buddhist text <i>Abhidharmakosha</i> (4.12c. III) affords
              a few more details about this prophecy:</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The monks
              and stream-attainers will be strong in their union with
              Dharma for 500 years after the Blessed One's Parinirvana.
              In the second 500 years they will be strong in meditation;
              in the third period of 500 years they will be strong in
              erudition. In the fourth 500-year period they will only be
              occupied with gift-giving. The final or fifth period of
              500 years will see only fighting and reproving among the
              monks and followers. The pure Dharma will then become
              invisible."</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Chapter
              26 of <i>Digha Nikaya</i>, we are told:</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"At that
              period, brethren, there will arise in the world an Exalted
              One named Maitreya, Fully Awakened, abounding in wisdom
              and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds,
              unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a
              teacher for gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha, even

              world of recluses and Brahmins, of princes and peoples,

          </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Elsewhere,

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Maitreya,
              the best of men, will then leave the Tushita heavens, and
              go for his last rebirth.&nbsp; As soon as he is born he
              will walk seven steps forward, and where he puts down his
              feet a jewel or a lotus will spring up. He will raise his
              eyes to the ten directions, and will speak these words,
              'This is my last birth.&nbsp; There will be no rebirth
              after this one. Never will I come back here, but, all
              pure, I shall win Nirvana."</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In recent
              years, a claimant calling himself Maitreya, with
              headquarters in England, has been offering himself to the
              world. He was born in 1944 in Iran, and claims to be a
              descendant of the Iranian king Nader Shad. His apologists
              offer numerous prophetic "proofs" of his authenticity, but
              all of them are dubious. In particular, he forgot to walk
              and talk at birth, and lotuses fail to sprout in his

              Buddha replied:</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"At that
              time, the ocean will lose much of its water, and there
              will be much less of it than now. In consequence a
              world-ruler will have no difficulties in passing across
              it. India, this island of Jambu, will be quite flat
              everywhere, it will measure ten thousand leagues, and all
              men will have the privilege of living on it. It will have
              innumerable inhabitants, who will commit no crimes or evil
              deeds, but will take pleasure in doing good... Human
              beings are then without any blemishes, moral offenses are
              unknown among them, and they are full of zest and joy.
              Their bodies are very large and their skin has a fine hue.
              Their strength is quite extraordinary. Three kinds of
              illness only are known --- people must relieve their
              bowels, they must eat, they must get old...</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Maitreya,
              the best of men, will then leave the Tushita heavens, and
              go for his last rebirth into the womb of that woman
              [Brahmavati]... As soon as he is born he will walk seven
              steps forward, and where he puts down his feet a jewel or
              a lotus will spring up. He will raise his eyes to the ten
              directions, and will speak these words: 'This is my last
              birth. There will be no more rebirth after this one. Never
              will I come back here, but, all pure, I shall in
              Nirvana!'...</font> </p>

              years Maitreya, the best of men, will preach the true
              Dharma, which is compassionate towards all living beings.
              And when he has disciplined in his true Dharma hundreds
              and hundreds of millions of living beings, then that
              leader will at last enter Nirvana. And after the great
              sage has entered Nirvana, his true Dharma still endured
              for another 10,000 years..."</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Buddha
              also described the decline of religion in the latter days
              of this age:</font> </p>

              it occur? After my decease there will first be five
              disappearances. What five? The disappearance of attainment
              (in the Dispensation), the disappearance of proper
              conduct, the disappearance of learning, the disappearance
              of outward form, the disappearance of the relics. There
              will be these five disappearances.</font> </p>

              attainment means that for a thousand years only after the

              disciples of mine are non-returners and once-returners and
              stream-winners. There will be no disappearance of

              will guard no more the four entire purities of moral
              habit. As time goes on and on they will only guard the
              four offenses entailing defeat. While there are even a
              hundred or a thousand monks who guard and bear in mind the
              four offenses entailing defeat, there will be no

              moral habit by the last monk or the extinction of his

              the word of the Buddha in the three Pitakas, for so long
              there will be no disappearance of learning. As time goes
              on and on there will be base-born kings, not Dharma-men;
              their ministers and so on will not be Dharma-men, and
              consequently the inhabitants of the kingdom and so on will
              not be Dharma-men. Because they are not Dharma-men it will
              not rain properly. Therefore the crops will not flourish
              well, and in consequence the donors or requisites to the
              community of monks will not be able to give them the
              requisites. Not receiving the requisites the monks will
              not receive pupils. As time goes on and on learning will
              decay. In this decay the Great Patthana itself will decay
              first... While a four-line stanza continues to exist among
              men, there will not be a disappearance of learning. When a

              coins placed in a golden casket on an elephant's back, and
              has had the drum sounded in the city up to the third time,
              to the effect that: 'Whoever knows a stanza uttered by the
              Buddhas, let him take these thousand coins together with

              four-line stanza, the purse containing the thousand coins
              must be taken back into the palace again ---&nbsp; then

              wander about with it in his hands, thinking, 'What's the
              good of this yellow robe?' and cutting off a small piece
              of one and sticking it on his nose or ear or in his hair,
              he will wander about supporting wife and children by
              agriculture, trade and the like. Then he will give a gift
              to the Southern community for those of bad moral habit. I
              say that he will then acquire an incalculable fruit of the
              gift. As time goes on and on, thinking: 'What's the good

              coming of the time. Then the moral law will be achieved in
              the actual life of mankind. The Holy See will be the seat

              hundredfold. Already many warriors of the truth are

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
              Zoroastran religion arose circa the 7th century BC, and
              perhaps even several centuries earlier, according to some
              commentators. Zoroaster (or, Zarathustra in Persian)
              taught that the primary deity is Ahura-Mazda had as his
              opponent Anghra Mainyu, who propose the <i>druj</i> ("The
              Lie"). Though closely matched in power, Ahura Mazda will
              eventually overcome Anghra Mainyu.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Zoroastrans
              also believe in cosmic cycles of time lasting 12,000 years
              and divided into 3,000-year epochs. At this time we are in
              the second epoch, the "Time of Mixture", which refers to
              the interaction of good and evil. Zoroastrans await the
              birth of a Saoshyant (savior) who is now overdue.</font> </p>
          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When
              Zoroaster died, his sperm was miraculously preserved in
              Iran’s Lake Kansaoya. When the time arrives, the sperm
              will impregnate a girl who is swimming there, and she will
              give birth to three sons. The first will be Ukhshyat-ereta
              ("He who makes righteousness grow"); later he will be
              called Hoshedarmah. One millennium later, Ukhshyat-nemah
              ("He who makes reverence grow") will be born, to be
              followed 1,000 years later by Astavat-ereta ("Righteous
              world"), who will oversee the end of time.</font> </p>

              brighter. The second is this, that Haptoiring (a star in
              the Bear constellation) will leave its place and will turn
              in the direction of Khorasan. The third is this, that the
              intercourse of persons one with another, will be great.
              The fourth is this, that the breach of faith, which they
              will make at that time, will have quicker and greater
              results. The fifth is this, that mean persons will be more
              powerful. The sixth is this, that wicked persons will be
              virtuous. The seventh is this, that the Drujs (evil
              powers) will be more oppressive. The eighth is this, that
              the magic and tricks which they will perform in those
              times, will be very bad. The ninth is this, that the
              noxious creatures, like the tigers, the wolves, and four
              clawed animals will do great harm. The tenth is this, that
              misinformed persons will commit great oppression upon the
              Dasturs of religion. The eleventh is this, that the injury
              to the Dasturs of religion will be unlawful; they will
              take their property by force and will speak evil of them.
              The twelfth is this, that the blowing of the summer and
              winter winds shall not be useful. The thirteenth is this,
              that affection for pleasure will be prevalent. The
              fourteenth is this, that those who arc born at that time
              will reach death more in a miserable way and in untimely
              way . The fifteenth is this, that respectable persons in
              spite of their respectful position, will practice too much
              of untruthfulness, injustice, and false evidence. Death,
              old age, unchecked pride, and strength will overtake (lit.
              reach) all countries. Then there will come the Dastur of
              the world. The apostle will cleanse the whole country. The
              sixteenth is this, that the two caves which are in Seistan

          <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"These
              twenty-four great persons, though they are seated on the
              thrones of everlasting rule, yet are worshipers of the
              appearance of the universal Manifestation, and they are
              humble and submissive, saying, 'We give thanks to Thee, O
              Lord God Almighty, Which art, and wast, and art to come,
              because Thou hast taken to Thee Thy great power and hast
              reigned' - that is to say, Thou wilt issue all Thy
              teachings, Thou wilt gather all the people of the earth
              under Thy shadow, and Thou wilt bring all men under the
              shadow of one tent.&nbsp; Although it is the Eternal
              Kingdom of God, and He always had, and has, a Kingdom, the
              Kingdom here means the manifestation of Himself; and He
              will issue all the laws and teachings which are the spirit
              of the world of humanity and everlasting life. And that
              universal Manifestation will subdue the world by spiritual
              power, not by war and combat; He will do it with peace and
              tranquility, not by the sword and arms; He will promote
              these divine teachings by kindness and righteousness, and
              not by weapons and harshness.&nbsp; He will so educate the
              nations and people that, notwithstanding their various
              conditions, their different customs and characters, and
              their diverse religions and races, they will, as it is
              said in the Bible, like the wolf and the lamb, the
              leopard, the kid, the sucking child and the serpent,
              become comrades, friends and companions.&nbsp; The
              contentions of races, the differences of religions, and
              the barriers between nations will be completely removed,
              and all will attain perfect union and reconciliation under
              the shadow of the Blessed Tree."</font> </p>
