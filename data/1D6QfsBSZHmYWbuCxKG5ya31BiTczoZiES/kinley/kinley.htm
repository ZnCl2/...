      LUNENBURG — At the water’s edge of a 119-year-old boatyard in
      Lunenburg, engineers are perfecting a surprisingly simple method
      of harnessing the sun’s energy to melt metals.<br>
      The Prometheus Project uses an ordinary mirror — albeit quite huge
      at five metres square — that bounces the sun’s energy onto a
      smaller mirror that then directs it into a crucible where it melts
      a lump of aluminum at 660 C.<br>
      <br>
      Inventor Peter Kinley said the groundbreaking results have
      astonishing potential for the industrial and residential sectors.
      It can be used as an environmentally friendly way to melt metal
      and to heat water to warm houses.<br>
      <br>
      "It’s a good time to look at renewables."<br>
      <br>
      With the high cost of oil, it is expensive to melt the metals the
      foundry needs to create parts for boats and ships, and burning oil
      hurts the environment. Kinley wanted to find a way to concentrate
      the sun’s energy and harness it to melt metals.<br>
      <br>
      This invention started out as a little experiment four years ago
      behind his farmhouse in Lilydale, just outside Lunenburg.<br>
      <br>
      "We wanted to find a renewable source of energy for the foundry,
      something that was able to give us a reduction in costs over our
      current methods and that was sustainable and long term," said
      Kinley, president and CEO of Lunenburg Industrial Foundry
      &amp;amp; Engineering Ltd.<br>
      <br>
      The folks working on this solar furnace, with its patented Kinley
      Dual Mirror System, are usually refurbishing boats — from Theodore
      Too to the Bluenose II and luxury yachts. But Kinley said it’s an
      ideal setup for his invention — he has the carpenters,
      electricians, plumbers and welders he needs to refine the
      technology, as well as the space to store the contraption in a
      huge boat shed.<br>
      <br>
      His first prototype, Alpha, was rudimentary, using polished
      stainless-steel sheets inside plywood casing.<br>
      <br>
      "I was surprised at how well our system worked from the get-go. We
      were able to melt metal the first time out."<br>
      <br>
      It generated a temperature of 407 C, melting a metal called
      babbit, which is made from lead and zinc.<br>
      <br>
      He called the National Research Council the next day to see who
      else was studying such technology and was shocked to learn no one
      was in Canada or anywhere else in the world.<br>
      <br>
      His team has been refining that original prototype a little more
      each year.<br>
      <br>
      "We decided to find a way to inexpensively duplicate what a
      magnifying glass would be able to do on a much larger scale,"
      Kinley said.<br>
      <br>
      With his initial success, he knew he had something big on his
      hands, but he didn’t want word to get out before he patented the
      design. So he dubbed the project Prometheus, for the Greek
      mythological character who stole fire from Zeus and gave it to
      people.<br>
      <br>
      "Prometheus is a name that we adopted as a code word for the
      project because our patent attorneys advised us to keep it under
      wraps until the patenting process was complete. So the name sort
      of stuck."<br>
      Instead of telling people he was working on a solar project, he
      would tell the curious he was working on Prometheus, and they just
      assumed it was a boat.<br>
      <br>
      As the foundry tweaks its invention, it has been working with
      Dalhousie University in Halifax to create a computer model of the
      temperatures the current system, Gamma II, has generated.<br>
      <br>
      It has reached recorded temperatures of 1,800 C, although Kinley
      suspects it gets far hotter, even though it hasn’t been proved yet
      because the Gamma II has melted the platinum thermocouples that
      were used to measure the temperature. They can withstand
      temperatures of 1,755 C. There were signs of vaporization when the
      Gamma II melted iron recently, and that happens at 2,800 C.<br>
      <br>
      As the Prometheus team continues to refine the Gamma II so that it
      can melt larger amounts of metals, and do it safely, a smaller
      version is undergoing six months of testing by Alberta Innovates —
      Technology Futures, the former Alberta Research Council, in
      Edmonton.<br>
      <br>
      The foundry is looking at the potential to commercialize the Gamma
      II by making it more automated and to provide solar heat in houses
      by heating water that passes through pipes.<br>
      Kinley said he would also like to work with a university doing
      research in high-temperature physics.<br>
      <br>
      In the short term, the foundry plans to use the Gamma II to create
      all its smaller castings, such as decorative door knockers,
      souvenir dories and Bluenose II replicas, by this summer.<br>
      "It’s completely carbon neutral, and we’d also like to increase
      the amount of metal it melts to displace our regular forms of
      melting."<br>

      substance such as, for example, metal, for use in a variety of
      applications including, inter alia, melting of metals in a
      foundry.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As the world- wide demand for energy increases exponentially,
      there is a heavy burden placed on traditional sources of energy,
      such as non-renewable fossil-based fuels. The price of crude oil
      has shown significant historical fluctuations. The spiraling cost
      of crude oil in recent years adversely effects the bottom-line of
      many small and medium scale energy- intensive industries such as
      foundries and the like. Therefore, alternate sources of energy,
      e.g., solar power, have become increasingly attractive in recent
      times. There is an environmental benefit to adopting cleaner
      energy sources as reduction of burning of fossil fuels helps to
      reduce greenhouse gas emissions<br>
      <br>
      Solar energy technology has developed significantly since the
      ancient Greek civilization learned the art of concentrating sun's
      rays. Over the years, solar energy research has helped develop
      systems that have improved efficiency and are more economical.
      However, a dearth of information, materials, complexity, and
      manufacturing skills remain an impediment to large-scale
      production and utilization of this abundantly available energy
      source.<br>
      <br>
      Solar concentrators are characterized and classified based on
      several criteria including the means of concentration: reflection
      or refraction; type of focusing: point, line, or non- focusing;
      type of concentrator: fixed or tracking concentrator; and, type of
      receiver: fixed or tracking receiver. As will be described and
      illustrated hereinafter, there are three primary types of
      reflective solar concentrating systems based on the type of
      focusing they produce, viz. , (a) parabolic trough concentrators
      that produce line focus; (b) central receiver-type concentrators
      that concentrate sunlight onto distant and centralized towers;
      and, (c) parabolic dish concentrators that produce a point focus.<br>
      <br>
      Based on the end application, the different types of solar
      concentrators are employed to achieve optimum results. For
      example, the parabolic trough concentrators are employed to
      produce electricity and heat. However, troughs have a low maximum
      solar concentration, high receiver heat loss, and are expensive.
      Central receiver-type concentrators are typically employed in
      large scale applications for electricity generation and require
      vast real-estate for proper deployment and are thus not economical
      for small and medium-scale industries. On the other hand,
      parabolic dish concentrators are highly efficient in concentrating
      the sun's rays. The biggest impediment to parabolic dish
      concentrators include, inter alia, the prohibitive costs
      associated with compound and complex reflector curves and
      expensive mirror substrates.<br>
      <br>
      In a typical solar concentrating system used in furnace
      applications, a high energy density solar radiation is provided to
      a target receiver, thus raising the temperature of the target.
      Depending on the degree of concentration, the optical properties
      (solar absorption and radiation) of the target surface, the system
      may be utilized to melt a target surface, thus forming a solar
      furnace.<br>
      <br>
      Over the years attempts have been made to design and construct
      solar concentrators that provide point focus (high solar
      concentration) with minimum complexity and cost. United States
      Patent No. 5,374,317 (Lamb et al.) discloses a multiple reflector
      concentrator solar electric power system. In this system, the
      sun's rays first reach a plane of individual primary reflectors
      (which may be flat or curved). The primary reflectors then reflect
      the solar radiation to the location of secondary reflectors (which
      may again be flat or curved) and are then passed through to the
      photovoltaic component. The system disclosed by Lamb et al. uses a
      large number of components other than primary and secondary
      reflectors such as tertiary reflectors, optional cover plates, and
      heat dissipation components particularly suited for solar power
      generation. This results in a system that is complex and
      expensive.<br>
      <br>
      United States Patent No. 6,530,369 (Yogev et al.) also describes a
      system comprising two reflectors that are successively arranged
      along an optical path of the system so that the first of the two
      reflectors reflects the radiation towards the second reflector.
      The concentrated radiation from the second reflector is directed
      to a solar receiver. However, the second reflector is realized as
      a tower reflector. As discussed earlier, central receiver-type
      concentrators are typically employed in large scale applications
      for electricity generation and require vast real-estate for proper
      deployment and are thus not economical for small and medium-scale
      industries.<br>
      <br>
      International Patent Publication No. WO 2005/022047 A2 (Shifman)
      discloses a solar energy utilization unit comprising a solar
      radiation concentrating component and a solar energy receiving
      component. The concentrating component comprises a concave primary
      reflector and a convex secondary reflector, for concentrating
      incident solar radiation and forwarding the concentrated radiation
      into the receiving component. However, the reflectors are
      dish-shaped and require high precision curved surfaces for
      obtaining proper concentration effects.<br>
      <br>
      United States Patent No. 4,784,700 (Stern et al.) describes a
      point focus solar concentrator which uses various geometries of
      cylindrical reflector strips as primary and secondary reflectors
      to simulate a point focus by overlapping the line foci of each
      segment at a coincident point. Although, the Stern et al. device
      uses cylindrical rather than dish- shaped parabolic mirrors that
      are easier to form and polish since they have a simple curvature,
      the arrangement of the reflector strips in a Fresnel-type mirror
      arrangement requires high manufacturing skills and therefore
      increases its cost.<br>
      <br>
      United States Patent No. 3,118,437 (Hunt) discloses a system of
      two reflective surfaces or two sets of reflective surfaces facing
      each other in an arrangement that causes all rays striking the
      first reflective surface to converge onto a substantially one
      point or limited area. Although Hunt discusses a system of two
      reflective surfaces, wherein the effective axes of curvature of a
      second surface or set of surfaces are being normal to the
      effective axes of curvature of the first surface or set of
      surfaces, the practical embodiments of Hunt's reflective system
      are complex and require elaborate infrastructure, such as, for
      example, carriages and tracks.<br>
      <br>
      There is accordingly a need for an improved solar concentrating
      system that overcomes the limitations associated with using
      complex construction requiring high degree of skills. Moreover,
      there is a need for an improved solar concentrating system wherein
      the prohibitive costs associated with manufacture and deployment
      of a traditional solar concentrating system are minimized thereby
      making it attractive for use by small and medium scale
      energy-intensive industries.<br>
      <br>

        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Fig. 1 shows three primary types of reflective solar concentrating
      systems based on the type of focusing they produce, viz. , (a)
      parabolic trough concentrators that produce line focus; (b)
      central receiver-type concentrators that concentrate sunlight onto
      distant and centralized towers; and, (c) parabolic dish
      concentrators that produce a point focus. The underlying principle
      of a two-stage solar concentrating system is illustrated in<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 2. A two-stage solar concentrating system comprises two
      single-curved mirrors (1, 2) curved in a parabolic shape so that
      the rays of the sun are reflected and concentrated to a point
      focus at a location (3). The two mirrors have two different focal
      lengths. The primary mirror (1) has a long focal length and the
      secondary mirror (2) has a short focal length. The rays of the sun
      are concentrated to a line focus by the primary mirror (1). The
      secondary mirror (2), with its plane of symmetry substantially
      orthogonal to that of the primary mirror (1), then intersects and
      concentrates the reflection from the primary mirror ( 1 ) so that
      the total reflected rays converge to a point focus at the target
      location (3). The secondary mirror (2) is located a distance away
      from the focal point of the primary mirror (1) that is equal to
      focal length of the secondary mirror (2).<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 shows an exemplary embodiment of the two-stage solar
      concentrating system (100) according to the present invention. A
      first sheet mirror and a second sheet mirror are bent/curved into
      first and second single-curved parabolic mirrors (10, 20) by a
      first support frame (15) and a second support frame (25),
      respectively. The support frames (15, 25) are constructed such
      that the focal length of the first single-curved parabolic mirror
      ( 10) is longer than focal length of the second single-curved
      parabolic mirror (20). The second single-curved parabolic mirror
      (20) is located at a distance equal to its focal length in front
      of the point of focus (line focus) of the first single-curved
      parabolic mirror (10) so as to maximize the incidence of the
      reflected radiation from the first single-curved parabolic mirror
      (10). The rays of the sun (shown by dashed lines) are concentrated
      to a line focus by the first single- curved parabolic mirror (10).
      The second single-curved parabolic mirror (20), with its plane of
      symmetry substantially orthogonal to that of the first
      single-curved parabolic mirror (10), intersects and concentrates
      the reflection from the first single-curved parabolic mirror (10)
      to a point focus in the vicinity of a target (35). The first and
      second support frame (15, 25) may be mounted on a solar tracking
      means, such as heliostats, to maintain orientation with the sun
      over time (not shown). In a preferred embodiment the first and
      second support frame (15, 25) are made of wood, steel, aluminum,
      plastic, composite materials, bronze alloy, copper based alloy, or
      combinations thereof. The first and second support frame (15, 25)
      may comprise means for accommodating the first and second
      single-curved parabolic mirrors (10, 20), means for changing the
      curvature of the first and second single-curved parabolic mirrors
      (10, 20), or both thereof. In a preferred embodiment the support
      frames (15, 25) comprise fasteners, stiffeners, braces, curved
      slots, or combinations thereof for controlling the curvature of
      the mirrors and for preventing gravitational sag. In still a
      preferred embodiment of the two-stage solar concentrating system
      according to the present invention the first and second support
      frame (15, 25) may be mounted each on primary and secondary booms
      (11) and (12), respectively. The primary and secondary boom (11,
      12) may be, optionally, mounted to a platform (13). However, the
      primary and secondary boom (11, 12) may be supported by any other
      supporting structure envisaged by a skilled artisan. The primary
      and secondary boom (11, 12) are attached, optionally, by means of
      a hinge mount (28) so as the angles between the first and second
      boom (11, 12) and the platform (13) be selectively varied so as to
      track the rays of the sun and keep the point focus on the target
      (35). Any means for manual and/or automatic variance of the angle
      between the first and second boom (11, 12) may be used,
      optionally, operably connected with sun tracking means and/or
      indicia, to cause adjustment of the relative position of the
      mirrors with respect to each other and the sun so as to produce a
      coincident and/or a square focus according to the present
      invention. In the embodiment illustrated in Fig. 3, the first
      single-curved parabolic mirror (10) is shown to have its plane of
      symmetry substantially parallel to the ground while the second
      single-curved parabolic mirror (20) is shown to have its plane of
      symmetry substantially orthogonal to the ground. However, any
      other orientation of the two mirrors may be employed as long as
      the planes of symmetries of the two mirrors are substantially
      orthogonal to each other and the second single-curved parabolic
      mirror (20) receives and further concentrates the sun rays
      reflected from the first single-curved parabolic mirror (10) to a
      point focus in the vicinity of the target (35). The size (area) of
      the first single-curved parabolic mirror may be chosen in
      accordance with the amount of energy needed. The continuous curved
      mirror surfaces of the two-stage solar concentrating system
      according to the present invention yield a very hot point focus.
      For example, a 4ft (width) x 8ft (height) first single-curved
      parabolic mirror (10) and an 8ft (width) x 4ft (height) second
      single-curved parabolic mirror (20) arranged in accordance with
      the present invention, resulted in a 4in x 4in square focus area
      providing a concentration ratio of approximately 300:1. The
      highest temperature recorded was 542[deg.] C. This temperature was
      sufficient to melt Babbitt metal.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of
      first (primary) and second (secondary) single-curved mirrors may
      be employed to increase the concentration of solar energy. In an
      exemplary embodiment Fig. 3 shows three first (primary)
      single-curved mirrors (10) with support frames (15) and one second
      (secondary) single-curved mirror (20) with support frame (25).
      However, it is to be understood that the number of primary and/or
      secondary mirrors may be suitably adapted, by a person skilled in
      the field pertaining to the present invention, so as to fit
      specific applications of the two-stage solar concentrating system.
      However, it is to be understood that the underlying optical
      principle of concentrating the sun rays with use of a two-stage
      arrangement of mirrors remains the same. For example, a number of
      primary mirrors may be arranged to focus through a single
      secondary mirror thereby increasing the effective concentration
      ratio. The plurality of primary mirrors may be mounted on a
      supporting frame and made to track the sun directly as a single
      unit in order to cast their combined reflection on a secondary
      mirror and then onto a point focus. Alternatively, the secondary
      mirror may also be mounted on the supporting frame together with
      the primary mirrors. Additionally, different combinations of focal
      lengths of the primary and secondary mirrors may also be employed.
      The solar collector can be multi-purpose. That is more than one
      receiver can me mounted so that the concentrated beam may be
      redirected simply by changing the angle of the secondary mirror.
      Different receivers can be installed for different purposes, such
      as: melting, steam generation, heat extraction, electrical
      generation, cooking, or others. Each receiver would have a
      standard mount so that they would be modular. Different receivers
      may be plugged in to the apparatus thus changing its application.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, due to mirror aberration and/or mirror
      irregularities, there may be a hot spot near the middle of the
      focus area while peripheral areas are cooler. The depth of the
      focus field may also be varied with different mirror arrangements.
      For example, there may be a warm spot before the focus, a hot spot
      in the center of the focus and a relatively cooler spot after the
      focus. Thus, the temperature of the target may be controlled by
      locating the target slightly off the point focus of the two-stage
      solar concentrating system. Multiple mirror systems may spread the
      energy to a number of targets within the same apparatus. Tertiary
      focusing mirrors may also be employed to increase the focus. An
      example of a tertiary focusing mirror is an internally mirrored
      cone or a parabolic dish concentrator.<br>
      <br>
      In the example described earlier, polished 20-gauge stainless
      steel sheets were used to form the continuously curved cylindrical
      parabolic mirrors (10, 20). Other materials such as mirrored
      glass, silvered mylar(TM) or polyester film (PET) sheets,
      preferably coated with aluminum or synthetic material having a
      suitable refractive index so that it may be effectively used for
      the mirror surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The first and second support frame (15, 25) were made from plywood
      frame in the experimental example (see Fig.6). However, frames
      using aluminum extrusions, wood, steel, plastic, or other suitable
      natural and synthetic material may also be used. The mirrors are
      held in a cylindrical parabolic shape by inserting the two
      opposing edges of the mirror sheets (usually the long sides) into
      a curved slot (61) provided in a side panel (63) of the support
      frame (15). The support frame may have separate slot holders that
      are independent of the support frame for changing the curvature of
      the mirror surfaces. Additional braces may be employed for
      preventing gravitational sag and to maintain proper cylindrical
      parabolic form of the mirrors. The support frame may be made up of
      simple beam elements, or may be combined into a truss-like
      structure. Fig. 6 shows an example of a support structure (15)
      with adjustable focal length made of plywood. The support
      structure is made of a back panel (62), side panels (63) and top
      and bottom panels (64). The side panels (63) are provided with
      separate slotted holders that are independent of the support frame
      (15) so as to allow adjustment of the curvature of the reflective
      sheet. Other braces may be employed to keep the ruled surface
      elements straight to prevent gravitational sag and maintain the
      cylindrical form of the reflective sheet. For example, diagonal
      braces (65) are provided on the back panel for support. In
      addition, hinges (66) may be provided to allow relocation of the
      reflective sheet. It is to be noted that the main consideration in
      the construction of the support frame is that it should be strong
      enough to support the weight of the mirrors as well as possible
      wind loads to maintain the desired alignment.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 shows an exemplary embodiment of a truss-like structure,
      wherein a plurality of first single-curved mirrors (10) and a
      second single-curved mirror (20) are mounted on a ring base (16).
      As shown in Fig. 4 the truss-like structure may comprise means for
      adjusting the relative position of the single-curved mirrors (10,
      20) as well as means for retaining the mirrors in the desired
      position. Other embodiments may be envisaged featuring, inter
      alia, high hinge mount and balance beam boom connecting primary
      and secondary mirrors. The two-stage solar concentration system
      according to the present invention may further comprise solar
      tracking means to adjust the orientation of the system to
      correspond with local height and direction of sun at a particular
      time. The tracking means may comprise wedges, hinges, castors,
      rails, bearings, foundation mounts, etc. and may be actuated
      manually or by electric or hydraulic apparatus and associated
      control devices. Another embodiment of the two-stage solar
      concentrating system according to the present invention mounted on
      a trailer (75) is illustrated in Fig. 5. The trailer (75) may be
      fitted with a pivot (30) and adjustable castors (29) and wheels
      (85) so that it may rotate sideways to track the sun through the
      day. Variance of the angles between the first boom (11) and the
      second boom (12) and between the booms (11, 12) and platform/base
      (14) as well as the pan and tilt angles of mirrors may be achieved
      by a combination of winch and pulley mechanism (31 ) operably
      interconnected to the frame support (15,20) and the booms (11, 12)
      and the platform/base (14) by a tension wire, chain, or rope (95).
      The position of the first and second support frame (15, 20) may be
      adjusted along the boom (11, 12) by use of a sliding mechanism
      engaged with and slidable along the first and second boom (11,
      12). In an exemplary embodiment the sliding mechanism employs a
      sliding carriage (23). In a similar manner the relative position
      of the receiver (36) containing the target (35), in respect of the
      first and second single-curved mirror (10, 20), may also be
      adjusted by use of a sliding mechanism or any other adjusting
      means known to a skilled artisan in the art pertaining to the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The tilt angle of mirrors may be adjusted through the day to
      provide desired focus arrangement. The individual elements of the
      two-stage solar concentrating system may be folded, stacked and
      packaged for transportation and erected in kit form for
      application in many different locations. The trailer mounted units
      may be towed to remote locations, unfolded and put into use.<br>
      <br>
      An exemplary embodiment of a receiver (36) containing a melting
      pot or target (35) is shown in Fig. 7. The exemplary receiver (36)
      shown in Fig. 7 is shaped like a cube with one vertical side (37)
      being made from a transparent material such as, for example, SiO2
      or acrylic glass. The receiver (36) may have an insulation (38)
      purposed to minimize thermal exchange between the target and the
      environment. Any known insulation material may be used provided
      that the various technical aspects known to person skilled in the
      art such as the suitable thickness, reaction to high temperature,
      means for attaching the insulation material to the wall of the
      receiver, etc. are selected according to the design and purpose of
      the specific application of the solar concentrating system of the
      present invention. Different receiver and target designs should be
      applied for melting solids, boiling liquids, or for electrical
      production. Some targets may be vertical while others, horizontal
      as the top of a pot. Receivers may or may not: be insulated, have
      covers, be dish shaped, be movable or fixed and have valves for
      control.<br>
      <br>
      Although the solar concentrating system described herein has been
      employed for concentrating solar energy for foundry applications,
      the system may be employed for several other applications. The
      applications of the two-sheet (cylindrical parabolic) mirror
      focusing system are many and varied for wherever and whatever heat
      energy is required. For example, the solar concentrating system
      may be employed for providing thermal energy to space heating,
      industrial processes, high temperature reduction of hazardous
      wastes, metal extrusion forming, roll forming, surface treatment,
      welding, fusing, annealing, or heat treatment of metals, and in
      petrochemical industries. Applications may include thermal
      industrial processes such as metal melting in foundry work for
      metal casting, melting scrap for recycling or reduction of ores in
      metal production. Units may be developed that serve the purpose of
      metal welding, brazing or soldering. It is envisioned that the
      solar concentrating system according to the present system may be
      useful for processing oil sands and shale into usable oil products
      with minimum emission of greenhouse gasses. It may be useful for
      production of synthetic fuels using solar photochemical and/or
      solar thermo-chemical processes and may include Hydrogen
      production. The two-sheet (cylindrical parabolic) mirror focusing
      system may be used for electrical production through a steam cycle
      generating system, Sterling heat engine or, photovoltaic electric
      generation systems. The two-sheet focusing system may be used for
      space heating, domestically (home heating), institutional or
      public space heating, whether the heat energy may be used right
      away or stored in a thermal storage device for later use and/or
      with heating ducts or thermal conduits to distribute the thermal
      energy across a distance to other locations. The two-sheet
      focusing system may be used for food processing, such as cooking
      or drying. Barbecue sized units could be developed for backyard
      applications on sunny days. The system may also be used in
      cremation facilities. The two-sheet focus might be taught to
      woodsmen or boy-scouts as a way to start a campfire. Small
      hand-held units might be developed to provide a sort of novelty
      cigarette lighter. For purposes of exemplification two
      applications of the two-stage solar concentrating system are
      illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9 and should not be construed as
      restrictive in any way. Fig. 8 shows an exemplary application of
      the two-stage solar concentrating system mounted on a barge to
      allow tracking the sun through the day and concentrating the solar
      radiation to a target area (35). A primary single-curved mirror
      (10) is mounted on the barge (80) through legs (81). A secondary
      single-curved mirror (20) is operably connected to the first
      single- curved mirror (10) by one or more struts (82). The struts
      may be attached directly to the barge and/or to the primary
      mirror, preferably by means of a hinge mount (28). The struts are
      provided at each end thereof with means to allow tilting and
      movement of the mirrors. Preferably, but not limited to, the
      mirrors are hingedly attached to the struts. In addition, means
      for adjusting the relative position of the struts with respect to
      the barge may be provided. Preferably, a sliding mechanism (83)
      may be provided to allow horizontal movement of the struts with
      respect to the barge. Solar tracking means may also be employed.
      The position adjusting means and/or the solar tracking means may
      comprise wedges, hinges, castors, rails, bearings, foundation
      mounts, etc. and may be actuated manually or by electric or
      hydraulic apparatus and associated control devices.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 9 shows another exemplary application of the two-stage solar
      concentrating system. In particular, Fig.9 shows a cigarette
      lighter (90) constructed according to the two- stage solar
      concentrating system disclosed herein. The cigarette lighter (90)
      may have a pedestal (91) as a base for a pillar (92). The pillar
      (92) may be provided with a U-shaped structure (93) having
      attached at the two ends thereof a horizontal arm (94) to which at
      least one primary mirror and at least one secondary mirror may be
      mounted in accordance with the present invention. The cigarette
      lighter as described above may further comprise means for
      adjusting the relative position of the single-curved mirrors (10,
      20) as well as means for retaining the mirrors into a desired
      position with a view to capturing solar radiation and
      concentrating the radiation to an area so as to cause ignition.<br>
