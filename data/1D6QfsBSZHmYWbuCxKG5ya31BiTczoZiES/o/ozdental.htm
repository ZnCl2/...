      <p>Let me paint you a picture. Every Monday morning, dental
        practices over the world power up for a week's worth of drilling
        and filling, tooth removal, and reconstruction work. Queues of
        fearful patients, tearful children being comforted by anxious
        parents, people in considerable pain, line up outside the doors
        to their dental surgeries. Once inside, these patients are
        subjected to the traditional smells of oil of cloves,
        disinfectants, and the noises of the high pitch whine of the
        dental drill; the odd scream or two filters through the hushed,
        usually silent waiting room into the street outside. It is a sad
        fact of life that every dentist is trained that if there is an
        area of decay in your tooth, the only way to treat this is to
        drill the decay out or amputate it, and then place a filling
        that will have to be replaced at some stage.</p>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>For a small minority of patients, where their dental practices
        have chosen to invest in a new technology, the opposite happens
        almost every day. The queue is one of bright, cheerful adults
        and children; there are few smells to associate this practice
        with the traditional one down the road. The noise of the drill
        is seldom heard, and happy smiling faces emerge from the
        treatment room.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Since 1998 researchers, lead by Professor Edward Lynch from
        Queen's Dental Hospital and Belfast University, Ireland, have
        opened a radically and revolutionary way forward. The dental
        profession no longer has to destroy tooth tissue to eliminate
        bacteria. A simple 60 second (average treatment time) treatment
        with a device that delivers a burst of ozone will destroy all
        the bacteria that caused the infection and the decay. It
        destroys all the organic effluents that are produced by these
        bacteria; this is shown in Fig 1 opposite. The top data shows
        the spread of organic bio-molecules produced by an active
        carious lesion. The lower data shows the effect of 10 seconds of
        ozone; the profile now consists of a single main spike of
        acetate acid, and the other oxidation by-product is carbon
        dioxide. This H MNR research proved that ozone worked as a
        pharmaceutical approach to caries in-vitro. By effectively
        sterilising the lesion, minerals from the patients own saliva
        will re-enter the areas of mineral loss to harden them. Once
        hardened, it is more resistant to future bacterial attack and
        mineral loss.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>There is in all our mouths a natural balance. Your tooth
        surface losses minerals into your saliva at certain times,
        usually just after you start to eat. These acidic conditions
        favour mineral loss. The normal acid/alkaline balance exists in
        the oral cavity. When bacteria attach themselves to a tooth
        surface, they set up a complex community of some 450 different
        bacterial types over a period of time. If patients skimp on
        using a tooth brush, or forget to use dental floss on a regular
        basis, these communities of bacteria evolve into one which
        produces large volumes of acids. These acids attack the tooth
        surface, dissolving out the minerals, leaving a hole or cavity.
        As this cavity now gives the bacterial colonies a degree of
        protection, tooth brushing cannot remove the bacteria and so the
        process of decay accelerates.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Yet decay is only an infection process that leads to the
        softening of the tooth, and the formation of a cavity, so could
        this infection be treated with, say, antibiotics? The bacteria
        that cause tooth decay are often found deep within the structure
        of the tooth, so their removal has to date only been by
        amputating the infected part of the tooth. Antibiotics and other
        pharmaceutical agents cannot penetrate deep enough through
        bacterial pellicle and tooth structure to eliminate acid niche
        environment. This teaching and technique is based on sound
        engineering principles that originate from the Victorians!
        Despite modern advances, there is no simple test that can be
        applied to a cavity to tell the dentist if they have removed all
        the infection! ­ or enough tooth material! And if areas of
        infection are left behind, there is a good chance that the
        filling placed will fail at some time in the future.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>In an attempt to prevent further infection and to restore the
        tooth to its original shape and function, a filling is then
        placed. Studies over the years have shown that fillings do not
        last very long, any where from 6 months to several years. But
        once a tooth has had part of it amputated, there is no going
        back. For each time the filling needs to be removed and
        replaced, there is a little less of the original tooth left and
        a larger filling. A point is reached where there is no option
        but to opt for expensive reconstruction work with advanced
        dental care or have the tooth removed.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>The dental professions goal is to help and educate the
        patient, how to avoid them entering into this cycle of tissue
        amputation and periodic filling replacement. Oral care education
        and modern toothpastes have helped reduce the number of
        cavities, but in poorer communities, those with disabilities and
        in long term institutions, as well as our aging population,
        decay is still prevalent. And diet advice is often lacking, so
        although patients may think they are doing well at home, the
        process of decay continues! The days of 'Wait &amp; Watch' are
        over ­ the profession is not entirely sure of what it is
        watching unless clinicians are using advanced clinical
        diagnostic tools.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Dental Ozone is a completely new way to look at decay. In the
        early stages of mineral loss, no use of the drill is required.
        The treatment is simple, inexpensive (certainly less than the
        cost of a filling), and requires no injection of anaesthetics.
        This does of course depend on the use of modern diagnostic
        equipment, such as the DIAGNOdent (KaVo GmbH). This laser is
        more accurate than x-rays, and far superior to the traditional
        mirror and probe that dentists often use. The mirror and probe
        are tools that can find holes, not diagnose areas of first stage
        decay. And research has shown that x-rays are very poor to
        visualise decay in a tooth surface, until it is 2-3 mm inside
        the inner layer of the tooth.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>If the area of decay is deeper, and more extensive, Ozone
        still has a role to play. The dental drill may need to be used
        to remove the cover of enamel over the decay, but this can also
        be carried out with air abrasion. No local anaesthetics are
        required, and Ozone is used to sterilise the area of decay,
        without the need to amputate a large volume of tooth structure.
        In this way, damage to the tooth is limited, and the inherent
        strength is preserved. Even in really deep areas of decay, Ozone
        can be used to preserve tooth tissue.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>When Ozone is combined with traditional care, then there are a
        number of advantages that patients and the dental profession can
        make use of. Ozone can be used to sterilise a cavity before a
        filling is placed, so there will be virtually no sensitivity
        after the local anaesthetic wears away. It can be used to
        eliminate sensitivity after new crowns or veneers are placed.
        And where wear facets have produced sensitive areas at the necks
        of teeth, in most cases a simple 40 second application with
        ozone can eliminate this sensitivity. There are many more
        applications for Ozone in a general dental or medical practice,
        and the studies for some of these can be found on
        www.the-o-zone.cc. This www site not only allows you to find a
        dental practice which has and uses Ozone, but also allows you to
        view the research papers that have been published from centres
        around the world.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>There is not a single facet of a medical, dental or veterinary
        practice where ozone cannot be used in some form for the benefit
        of patients ­ from the general to specialist practice and health
        care centre all can take advantage of this new technology.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>So, perhaps a Monday morning at a dental practice that has
        invested in modern technology is no longer the stressful,
        painful and anxious visit that it used to be. The waiting room
        in this practice are full of smiles, people chatting to the
        dental team members as they wait with happy anticipation at
        being called through for their turn in the treatment room. Mums
        and dads with children have no fear or anxiety, as they are
        reassured that modern technology has opened a door for them,
        that most of the older population had never believed possible.
        For both the patient and the dental practice, it is a technology
        that has a winning solution for both; the treatment is fast, it
        is predictable, it is painless, and also reduces the long-term
        cost of the treated tooth. For the dental practice, the
        treatment times are reduced, it is profitable, and the treatment
        less stressful. For the patient, modern technology has allowed
        them to have a 21st century treatment, rather than one that is
        old fashioned, and out-dated.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>In a lead article published in 2003 I wrote; 'In the vast
        majority of dental practices - not just in the United Kingdom
        and Europe, but throughout the world - the primary method to
        reverse the effects of decay remains 'drill and fill'. The entry
        of a patient into the cycle of drill and fill is irreversible.
        Once a hole is drilled into a tooth, the patient always will
        have it; and no matter how good a clinician each dentist
        perceives themselves to be, any restorative material will fail
        at some time.'</dt>
      <dt>The dental profession has not kept up with their medical
        counterparts in finding a holistic treatment method for what is
        a prevalent infection ­ caries. The Victorian principles of
        amputation to establish a sound foundation for restorative care
        no longer are valid in the light of new published research and
        clinical experience.</dt>
      <dt>Ozone at last offers the dental profession this new approach
        instead of the out-dated and Victorian amputational model.&nbsp;
        --- Dr Julian Holmes, 2007.</dt>
      <dt>The Ozi-cure is a self-contained device to generate ozone gas
        from air for the use in Dental, Medical or Veterinary Practice
        for surface application.</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>The Ozi-cure Dental Unit manufactured by O3 and distributed in
        Germany by American Dental GmbH. The Ozi-cure achieved CE and
        Medical Directive Certificates in November 2006.</dt>
      <dt>The treatment times used in dental ozone treatment are short
        from 10 to 60 seconds (Baysan and Lynch, 2001). The area to be
        treated and the application of ozone is carefully controlled by
        localised 'bagging' and high-volume suction.</dt>
      <dt>The use of ozone in dental practice takes dental care into the
        21st Century. It sets the standard of a modern pharmaceutical
        method to treat dental and medical patients;</dt>
      <dt>&nbsp;</dt>
      <dt>Studies from Europe (Abu-Salem et al, 2003; Baysan and Lynch
        2001; Holmes, 2003; Holmes and Lynch, 2003) have shown
        conclusively that the use of ozone in dental care is effective
        as a non-destructive method to manage decay and its destructive
        effects. The use of ozone has been shown to be the ideal way to
        manage anxiety of patients ­ young and old - and their carers
        (Dahnhardt et al, 2003; Domingo et al, 2004).</dt>
      <dt>The effects of ozone reduce tooth destruction in routine
        preparation (Clifford, 2004; Holmes, 2004; Holmes and Lynch,
        2004) and ozone reduces the time and the cost of dental care
        (Domingo and Holmes, 2004; Johnson et al, 2003) and raises the
        practice income. In Endodontics, ozone is effective against
        Enterococcus faecalis (Chang et al, 2003).</dt>
      <dt>Professor Velio Bocci from Milan University (1994) has
        emphasised that the potential toxicity of O3 should not preclude
        its employment for medical, dental &amp; veterinary purposes.
        This statement has been echoed by thousands of health
        professionals who use ozone in clinical practices around the
        world, and millions of patients that have been treated.</dt>
      <dt>The correct operation of the Ozi-cure meets all current Health
        and Safety Regulations in all countries. The Ozi-cure is
        completely safe when used according to the Ozi-cure Operating
        Instructions.</dt>
      <dt>Ozone is perceived to be a dangerous gas; let's put this into
        a scientific context. In 1978 an FDA Report showed that 1.5
        million people were hospitalised by pharmaceutical reactions,
        and there were 140,000 deaths from prescription drug usage.</dt>
      <dt>In stark contrast, a 1980 German Medical Society Report for
        Ozone Therapy cited 5.6 million ozone treatments carried out for
        that year. Of the 5.6 million ozone treatments, there were just
        40 reported cases of side effects (0.000007%), and 4 deaths from
        inappropriate administration of ozone gas. Ozone remains the
        safest and effective pharmaceutical treatment.</dt>
      <dt>In World War I, ozone was used to treat wounds, burns and
        infections. The modern development of ozone's application to
        Medicine began in the 1950s in Europe, Australia, Israel, Cuba,
        Brazil and Columbia. Today, over 9000 doctors, dentists &amp;
        vets worldwide now routinely use ozone in their clinical
        management.</dt>
      <dt>Research in Cuba, Europe, the USA and South Africa concerning
        the anti-microbial efficacy of ozone has continued over the last
        twenty years and has conclusively shown the ability of both
        gaseous and dissolved ozone to eradicate a wide range of
        bacteria, bacterial spores and viruses (Baysan and Lynch, 2001;
        Ishizaki, 1986; Katzeneleson, 1974; Vaughan, 1987; Whistler and
        Sheldon, 1989).</dt>
      <dt>A clinical guide for the use of ozone in dental and medical
        practice is included with every Ozi-cure device sold.</dt>

        A method for removing biofilm from, and/or for preventing
        biofilm from forming on, an interior surface of a conduit that
        receives a supply of water, is performed by disabling the supply
        of water to the conduit, and passing an ozone-containing gas to
        the conduit. The ozone-containing gas can be generated from an
        oxygen-containing gas that is exposed to either a corona
        discharge or ultraviolet radiation. In an alternate embodiment,
        the water is disinfected by the ultraviolet radiation. The
        invention is especially suited for use with dental equipment. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to the use of ozone in the treatment of
        dental caries. </p>
      <p>The great destructive disease of teeth is dental caries which
        may be defined as the acid dissolution of enamel, dentine or
        cementum as a consequence of the metabolism of micro-organisms
        living within deposits on the teeth known as plaque. Dental
        caries are believed to be associated with specific
        micro-organisms, the principal ones being Streptococcus Mutans,
        Lactobacilli, Actinomyces Visosus Serovar 2, Actinomyces
        Naeslundii and "Intermediate" Actinomyces, other Streptococci
        and yeasts. These are acid producing micro-organisms which
        produce acids such as acetic and lactic acids from the dietary
        carbohydrates. The micro-organisms associated with dental caries
        are unique and are ecologically very different from those
        associated with, for example, infected root canals. </p>
      <p>Dental caries is currently managed by one or more of the
        following: </p>
      <p>(i) preventive treatment by, for example, dietary and oral
        hygiene measures and may include the topical application of
        chemotherapeutic agents; </p>
      <p>(ii) the removal of dentine exhibiting the signs of active
        caries; </p>
      <p>(iii) the protection of any newly exposed non-carious dentine
        with restorative material. </p>
      <p>Measures aimed at the prevention or the arrest of dental caries
        are mainly based on the elimination of dental plaque from the
        surfaces of roots and the institution of dietary controls to
        reduce the frequency and quantity of readily fermentable
        carbohydrate ingestion. The mechanical removal of plaque has
        been a major platform for the prevention of dental caries for
        some time. However, this poses special problems in the case of
        primary root caries due to access problems. Because dentine has
        a Knoop hardness of 68 in contrast to enamel at 11, the
        mechanical removal of plaque from its surface inevitably results
        in some loss of tissue also. Toothbrush abrasion is now a very
        common phenomenon and invariably leads to the loss of root
        dentine from the facial aspects of teeth. Consequently, the
        traditional methods of plaque control in the prevention of
        dental caries create further problems even when access permits
        it to be used effectively. </p>
      <p>Conventional caries removal and cavity preparation entail the
        use of high and low speed handpieces. However, disadvantages of
        this system include the perception that drilling is unpleasant
        for patients and local anaesthetic is frequently required.
        Furthermore, handpieces are expensive to purchase and maintain
        and their use may lead to the removal of softened but uninfected
        dentine resulting in the excessive loss of tooth tissue. </p>
      <p>Where restoration is required, all materials used to restore
        carious lesions have their limitations. For example, gold and
        ceramic are expensive and present a technical challenge for the
        practitioner. While amalgam is a durable, predictable material,
        it has poor aesthetic qualities, is potentially toxic and may
        cause allergic reactions in some people. </p>
      <p>It is an object of the invention to alleviate the disadvantages
        of the prior art. </p>
      <p>It has now unexpectedly been found that ozone can penetrate
        carious tissue and can therefore be used in the treatment of
        dental caries. </p>
      <p>According to the present invention there is provided the use of
        ozone in the preparation of a therapeutic system for the
        treatment of dental caries. </p>
      <p>As used herein, the term "ozone" is intended to embrace pure
        ozone, oxonised air and ozonised aqueous media, such as water
        optionally containing a reductant, such as thiocyanate or
        peppermint. </p>
      <p>The ozone is delivered at a pressure sufficient to penetrate
        the carious tissue and at a concentration and for a period of
        time sufficient to kill substantially all of the micro-organisms
        within the carious lesion. </p>
      <p>Preferably, a needle-sized jet of pure ozone or ozonised air in
        a shroud of micro-organism-free aqueous medium, e.g. water
        optionally containing a reductant, is injected at the desired
        location. </p>
      <p>If desired, a sealant of the type known in the art may be
        applied to a carious lesion following ozone treatment. </p>
      <p>The advantages of using ozone in the treatment of dental caries
        include the following: </p>
      <p>1. It eliminates drilling and its attendant problems; </p>
      <p>2. It is rapid and painless; </p>
      <p>3. It does not require sophisticated methods of isolating the
        tooth; </p>
      <p>4. No local anaesthetic is required. </p>
      <p>The invention is illustrated in the following Examples. Unless
        otherwise stated, the ozone delivered in the following Examples
        is present in air at a concentration of 5.2%. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p>Many studies concerning the clinical evaluation of ozone have
        been based on assessments of its harmful effects rather than
        demonstrating any therapeutic benefits it may offer. Ozone is
        one of nature's most powerful oxidants which accounts for its
        ability to kill bacteria, spores and viruses. Uniquely, ozone
        decomposes to a harmless, non-toxic and environmentally safe
        material (oxygen). In this investigation, a multicomponent
        evaluation of the oxidative consumption of salivary biomolecules
        by ozone (O.sub.3) has been performed using high resolution
        proton (.sup.1 H) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.
        The ozone-generating equipment employed in this study was
        designed by Purezone Ltd. (Ipswich, U.K.). Unstimulated human
        saliva samples were collected from 8 patients and each of them
        was divided into two equivalent portions (0.60 ml). The first of
        these was treated with O.sub.3 generated from the above device
        for a period of 30 seconds; the second group of portions served
        as controls. Samples were subjected to .sup.1 H NMR analysis at
        an operating frequency of 600 MHz. Results acquired revealed
        that O.sub.3 treatment gave rise to (1) the oxidative
        decarboxylation of the salivary electron-donor pyruvate
        (generating acetate and CO.sub.2 as products), (2) oxidation of
        the volatile sulphur compound precursor methionine to its
        corresponding sulphoxide and (3) the oxidative consumption of
        salivary polyunsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, evidence for the
        O.sub.3 -mediated oxidation of salivary 3-D-hydroxybutyrate was
        also obtained. High field .sup.1 H NMR spectroscopy provides
        much useful analytical data regarding the fate of O.sub.3 in
        human saliva, information which is of much relevance to its
        potential therapeutic actions in vivo. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 2 </p>
      <p>Ozone Effect on Microflora from Primary Root Caries Ex-vivo </p>
      <p>Primary root carious lesions (PRCL) are a major clinical
        problem. The aim of this study was to establish if ozone could
        achieve effective microbial killing in PRCL. An ozone producing
        generator (Purezone Ltd., Ipswich, U.K.) was used in this
        ex-vivo study assessing the use of ozone on PRCL. In this study,
        soft PRCL requiring restoration were used as these are the most
        severe type of lesion found in humans. 20 freshly extracted
        teeth with PRCL requiring restoration were used. After plaque
        removal using a hand held standard fine nylon fibre sterile
        toothbrush with sterile water as a lubricant to cleanse the
        surface, each tooth was then isolated using sterile cotton wool
        rolls and dried using a dry sterile cotton wool roll. A sample
        of PRCL was taken using a sterile excavator from half of the
        most active part of the lesion. Subsequently, 10 seconds of the
        ozonised water was applied to the lesion and another sample was
        taken from the other half of the most active part of the lesion.
        Each sample was weighed and immediately placed in 1 ml of
        Fastidious Anaerobe Broth (FAB). To each 1 ml of FAB containing
        a biopsy of carious or ozone treated carious dentine, sterile
        glass beads were added. They were vortexed for 30 seconds to
        facilitate the extraction of any micro-organisms from the
        carious dentine and disperse any aggregates. After decimal
        dilution with FAB, 100 ml aliquots of these was spread on
        Fastidious Anaerobe Agar (LabM. Bury, Lancs., U.K.) supplemented
        with 5% (V/V) horse blood in an anaerobic chamber at 37.degree.
        C. for four days. The mean.+-.SE number of each colony type was
        counted and calculated. </p>

      <p>Using the paired Student t-test a significant difference
        (p&lt;0.001) was observed between the two groups. Clearly, the
        percentage of micro-organisms killed associated with the use of
        ozone was more than 99%. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 3 </p>
      <p>Ozone Effect on Microflora from Primary Root Caries Ex-vivo </p>
      <p>The procedure of Example 2 was repeated except that ozonised
        water was applied to the lesion for 20 seconds. Using the paired
        student t-test, a significant difference was observed in the
        ozonised water group (log.sub.10 3.77.+-.0.42, mean.+-.SE)
        compared with the control group (log.sub.10 6.18.+-.0.21)
        (p&lt;0.001). </p>
      <p>The results of these tests show that the use of ozone can
        provide an effective, rapid and simple means for killing
        micro-organisms in carious lesions. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 4 </p>
      <p>Sealant Shear Bond Strength to Sound and Carious Radicular
        Dentine </p>
      <p>There has been little research on the interaction between
        primary root carious lesions (PRCL) and adhesive materials. The
        aim of this study was to examine the shear bond strength of four
        adhesive systems to PRCL with sound dentine acting as a control.
        The adhesive systems used were: </p>
      <p>1. OptiBond FL Prime.sup.1 /OptiBond FL Adhesive.sup.1
        /OptiGuard.sup.1 </p>
      <p>2. OptiBond FL Prime/OptiGuard </p>
      <p>3. OptiGuard and </p>
      <p>4. ChemFil II.sup.2 </p>
      <p>The materials were applied to sound radicular dentine and PRCL
        in vitro in freshly extracted teeth. The bonding site was
        macroscopically intact, was flat and had at least a 3.5 mm
        diameter. 37% phosphoric acid was used for 15 seconds in samples
        in groups 1.fwdarw.3 whilst 25% polyacrylic acid was used in
        group 4. After bonding the samples were stored for seven days in
        a moist atmosphere at 37.degree. C. A shearing force was applied
        at 1 mm/minute. There were at least 10 samples in each group.
        The mean (s.e.) shear bond strengths were (MPa); </p>
      <p>Adhesive Control Carious OptiBond FL Prime/OptiBond 5.31 (1.03)
        5.58 (1.05) FL Adhesive/OptiGuard OptiBond FL Prime/OptiGuard

        ChemFil II 1.42 (0.28) 1.01 (0.26) </p>
      <p>While statistical testing showed that the shear bond strength
        of the OptiBond FL Prime/OptiBond FL Adhesive/OptiGuard was
        significantly the highest, (p&lt;0.001), the caries status of
        the root surface had no significant influence on the bond
        strength. OptiGuard in combination with OptiBond FL Prime and
        OptiBond Adhesive had the highest bond strength and this was not
        influenced by the caries status of the surface. </p>

      <p>EXAMPLE 5 </p>
      <p>The Effect of Ozone on Primary Root Caries and Associated
        Micro-organisms </p>
      <p>The aims of these studies were to evaluate the efficiency of
        ozone on primary root caries and associated micro-organisms
        (Streptococcus sobrinus; TH 21, Streptococcus mutans; NCTC
        10449). In study 1, 40 soft primary root carious lesions (PRCLs)
        from freshly extracted teeth were used and randomly divided into
        two groups to test the exposure to ozone for either 10 or 20
        seconds. There was a significant (p&lt;0.001) difference
        (Mean.+-.SE) between the control samples for. either 10 seconds
        (log.sub.10 5.91.+-.0.15) or 20 seconds (log.sub.10
        6.18.+-.0.21) and ozone treated samples for either 10 seconds
        (log.sub.10 3.57.+-.0.37) or 20 seconds (log.sub.10
        3.77.+-.0.42). In study 2, 40 sterile saliva coated glass beads
        were put into bijoux bottles with 3 mls of Todd Hewitt broth for
        control and test groups. S. sobrinus and S. mutans were
        inoculated and incubated anaerobically overnight. Each glass
        bead was washed with 2 mls of PBS. Immediately, 10 seconds of
        ozone was applied to the glass beads in the test groups.
        Subsequently, each glass bead in the test and control groups was
        placed in 3 mls of Todd Hewitt Broth with six more sterile glass
        beads and were vortexed for 30 seconds. After decimal dilutions,
        100 ml aliquots were spread on blood agar plates supplemented
        with 5% (V/V) horse blood and placed in an anaerobic chamber at
        37.degree. C. for two days. The number of each colony type was
        counted and calculated. Using the paired student t-test, there
        was a significant reduction (p&lt;0.0001) (Mean.+-.SE) between
        the control samples for S. sobrinus (log.sub.10 4.61.+-.0.13)
        and S. mutans (log.sub.10 3.93.+-.0.07) and ozone treated
        samples for S. sobrinus (log.sub.10 1.09.+-.0.36) and S. mutans
        (log1.01.+-.0.27). This treatment regime is therefore an
        effective, quick, conservative and simple method to kill
        micro-organisms in primary root carious lesions. </p>
