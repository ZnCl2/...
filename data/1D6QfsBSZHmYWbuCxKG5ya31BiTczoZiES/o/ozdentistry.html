      The use of oxygen in complementary therapies has been gaining
      momentum in recent years, particularly in the area of dentistry.
      While ozonated olive oil has many practical and effective uses,
      such as supporting skin health, research has shown it to be
      especially helpful for periodontal disease. Gingivitis, typically
      caused by diets laden with sugar and refined carbohydrates, is a
      growing issue today. One recent study is revealing just how
      powerful ozonated therapy can be in the area of teeth and gum
      health. If you’re currently suffering from any type of dental
      issue, you may want to continue reading.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Olive Oil: A Potential Complementary Periodontitis Approach</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone therapy isn’t an entirely new concept in dentistry. Previous
      research and medical reviews have discussed the importance of
      ozone in replacing antiseptic agents used against gingival
      infections. [1] A study published in Tanta Dental Journal
      evaluated 30 subjects with periodontal disease, each receiving
      standard periodontitis treatments. [2] Half of the group was
      subjected to both standard treatments and ozonated therapy. These
      patients received ozonated olive oil gel applied to the main site
      of gum damage.<br>
      <br>
      The group that received the complementary therapy in addition to
      conventional treatment saw longer lasting improvements in
      symptoms. As a matter of fact, the ozonated therapy combined with
      root scaling resulted in sustained improvements for up to six
      months, while the benefits from the standard treatment alone only
      lasted about a month. Although the size of the study participants
      is relatively small, it is one study among dozens that indicate
      the effectiveness of ozone therapy in complementing standard
      medical applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using Ozonated Olive Oil</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the main uses for ozonated olive oil is in the area of skin
      health. Ozonated olive oil contains antibacterial compounds that
      may support the skin’s defense against bacteria and other
      compounds that cause acne. Olive oil itself is also an excellent
      moisturizer, providing a nourishing smoothness to the skin. Many
      people also brush their teeth with ozonated olive oil in addition
      to fluoride-free toothpaste to get a deep clean.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone has been proposed as an alternative antiseptic agent in
      dentistry based on reports of its antimicrobial effects in both
      gaseous and aqueous forms. This study investigated whether gaseous
      ozone (4 x 10(6) microg m(-3)) and aqueous ozone (1.25-20 microg
      ml(-1)) exert any cytotoxic effects on human oral epithelial (BHY)
      cells and gingival fibroblast (HGF-1) cells compared with
      established antiseptics [chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) 2%, 0.2%;
      sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 5.25%, 2.25%; hydrogen peroxide
      (H(2)O(2)) 3%], over a time of 1 min, and compared with the
      antibiotic, metronidazole, over 24 h. Cell counts, metabolic
      activity, Sp-1 binding, actin levels, and apoptosis were
      evaluated. Ozone gas was found to have toxic effects on both cell
      types. Essentially no cytotoxic signs were observed for aqueous
      ozone. CHX (2%, 0.2%) was highly toxic to BHY cells, and slightly
      (2%) and non-toxic (0.2%) to HGF-1 cells. NaOCl and H(2)O(2)
      resulted in markedly reduced cell viability (BHY, HGF-1), whereas
      metronidazole displayed mild toxicity only to BHY cells. Taken
      together, aqueous ozone revealed the highest level of
      biocompatibility of the tested antiseptics.<br>

      </b><b><br>
        OBJECTIVE:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The aim was to determine the antimicrobial effect of ozonated
      water, ozonated water with ultrasonication, sodium hypochloride
      and chlorhexidine (CHX) in human primary root canals contaminated
      by Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis).<br>
      <br>
      <b>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Fifty-eight extracted human primary molar teeth were used. Crowns
      were cut off using a diamond saw under water-cooling. One hundred
      roots were obtained and mechanically prepared. The roots were then
      sterilized by autoclaving in water for 15 min at 121°C. All
      samples were contaminated with E. faecalis for 24 h and the root
      canals were randomly divided into five groups (n = 20). Group I:
      25 mg/L of Ozonated water (O3aq), Group II: 25 mg/L of O3aq with
      ultrasonication, Group III: 2.5% Sodium hypochloride (NaOCl),
      Group IV: 2% CHX and Group V: Positive control. The canal of each
      specimen was irrigated for 4 min and positive control was
      untreated. All root canals were agitated with sterile saline
      solution. The saline solution was collected from canals with
      sterile paper points. For each specimen, the paper points were
      transposed to eppendorf vials containing 2 ml of brain heart
      infusion. According to bacterial proliferation, the mean values of
      optical density were achieved by ELISA (Biotek EL ×800, Absorbance
      Microplate Reader, ABD) and the data were analyzed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      NaOCI, CHX and two types of O3aq were found statistically
      different than positive control group. NaOCI irrigation was found
      significantly most effective.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      NaOCl, CHX and O3aq applications provide antibacterial effect in
      vitro conditions in primary root canals.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In endodontics, the elimination of resistant bacteria such as
      Enterococcus faecalis plays an important role for treatment
      success in root canals. Therefore, new alternative irrigants
      (instead of sodium hypochlorite) have been researched to achieve
      ideal endodontic treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECTIVES:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate and to compare the
      antibacterial effect of aqueous ozone with different
      concentrations and techniques of application (manual and
      ultrasonic) against E. faecalis in human root canals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PATIENTS AND METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Eighty single-root mandibular premolar teeth were selected,
      prepared and sterilized. E. faecalis was incubated in the root
      canals and kept at 37°C for 24 h. The teeth were divided into four
      main groups each has 20 members: NaOCl (positive control) group; 8
      ppm aqueous ozone group; 12 ppm aqueous ozone group; and 16 ppm
      aqueous ozone group. While half of the specimens were disinfected
      with aqueous ozone by manual technique, the other half was
      disinfected with the aqueous ozone by ultrasonic technique.
      Conventional irrigation technique was simultaneously applied with
      ultrasonic vibration that was produced by VDW.ULTRA device. The
      disinfection procedures were performed for 180 s to ensure
      standardization of all the working groups. Paper points (placed in
      the root canals before and after the disinfection procedures) were
      transferred to Eppendorf tubes containing 0.5 mL of brain heart
      infusion broth. Then, 50 µL of the suspension was inoculated onto
      broth agar media. Microbial colonies were counted, and the data
      were evaluated statistically using 2-way analysis of variance
      (ANOVA) and Tukey tests.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Although the antibacterial effect of 16 ppm aqueous ozone using a
      manual technique had an insufficient effect, its ultrasonic
      application technique resulted in complete disinfection in the
      root canals.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The bactericidal activity of high concentration of aqueous ozone
      combined with ultrasonic application technique showed efficacy
      similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl in root canals.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The 21(st) century dental practice is quite dynamic. New treatment
      protocols and new materials are being developed at a rapid pace.
      Ozone dental therapy falls into the category of new treatment
      protocols in dentistry, yet ozone is not new at all. Ozone therapy
      is already a major treatment modality in Europe, South America and
      a number of other countries. What is provided here will not be an
      exhaustive scientific treatise so much as a brief general
      introduction into what dentists are now doing with ozone therapies
      and the numerous oral/systemic links that make this subject so
      important for physicians so that, ultimately, they may serve their
      patients more effectively and productively. <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>BACKGROUND:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone is an unstable gas, capable of oxidizing any biological
      entity. It is an effective bactericide in its gaseous as well as
      aqueous form.<br>
      <br>
      <b>AIMS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The objective of this study was to determine the in-situ
      antimicrobial effect of 0.1 ppm ozonated water on plaque and
      salivary microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      24 h old supragingival plaque (SP) was collected from the two most
      posterior teeth in the contralateral quadrants before and after a
      30 s rinse with either distilled water (control group) or 0.1 ppm
      ozonated water (test group). Simultaneously stimulated whole
      saliva (SWS) was collected for both groups. The SP and SWS were
      stained with LIVE/DEAD Baclight Bacteria Viability fluorescent kit
      to visualize live and dead microbes. The salivary flow rate,
      calcium and protein level were also determined in the pre- and
      post-rinsed samples. The data obtained was subjected to One Way
      ANOVA test using Minitab 14 statistical software (PA, USA).<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      0.1 ppm ozonated water was found effective in reducing the
      bacterial load in both the 24 h plaque and SWS samples, but it did
      not eliminate them completely. In addition, there was no
      statistically significant effect of the ozonated water rinse on
      the salivary flow rate, salivary calcium and protein
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      <b>CONCLUSIONS:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      0.1 ppm ozonated water rinse can be an effective adjunct to tooth
      brushing and flossing to maintain plaque and salivary bacterial
      load.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gingival and Periodontal diseases represent a major concern both
      in dentistry and medicine. The majority of the contributing
      factors and causes in the etiology of these diseases are reduced
      or treated with ozone in all its application forms (gas, water,
      oil). The beneficial biological effects of ozone, its
      anti-microbial activity, oxidation of bio-molecules precursors and
      microbial toxins implicated in periodontal diseases and its
      healing and tissue regeneration properties, make the use of ozone
      well indicated in all stages of gingival and periodontal diseases.
      The primary objective of this article is to provide a general
      review about the clinical applications of ozone in periodontics.
      The secondary objective is to summarize the available in vitro and
      in vivo studies in Periodontics in which ozone has been used. This
      objective would be of importance to future researchers in terms of
      what has been tried and what the potentials are for the clinical
      application of ozone in Periodontics.<br>

      </b><br>
      Gingivitis and periodontitis are most common inflammatory diseases
      of supporting tissues of teeth. Role of microbial etiology and
      host response in progression of gingival and periodontal diseases
      has been well established. Because of the beneficial biological
      effects of ozone, due to its antimicrobial and immunostimulating
      effect, it is well indicated in the treatment of gingival and
      periodontal diseases. The objective of this article is to provide
      a general review about clinical applications of ozone in treatment
      of periodontal diseases and to summarize the available in vitro
      and in vivo studies in Periodontics in which ozone has been used.

      </b><br>
      A previous paper, recently published in Primary Dental Care, gave
      an overview of the medical uses of ozone and outlined some of its
      uses in dentistry. The current paper focuses on a description of
      use of ozone in the management of root caries and considers recent
      studies in this area. There has been relatively limited research
      into the non-invasive (pharmaceutical) management of root caries.
      The best management strategy still remains to be developed.
      Initial studies have indicated that an application of ozone for a
      period of either 10 or 20 seconds is capable of clinically
      reversing leathery root carious lesions. It is suggested that,
      subject to confirmation from extensive trials, this simple and
      non-invasive technique may benefit many patients with root caries
      throughout the world since this approach to treat root caries can
      easily be employed in primary care clinics and in the domiciliary
      treatment of home-bound elderly people and immobile patients in
      hospices and hospitals.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone is a triatomic molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms. It
      is applied to oral tissues in the forms of ozonated water,
      ozonated olive oil and oxygen/ozone gas. This paper presents a
      brief review on the chemistry of ozone as well as its medical and
      dental applications focusing on its use in endodontics. Ozone’s
      antimicrobial activity, its effect on dentin bonding, toxicity and
      contra-indications are also reviewed.<br>

      <b>1.Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1839, Christian F. Schonbein, first noticed the emergence of a
      pungent gas with an electric smell. Later, in 1857, Wener Von
      Siemens designed an ozone generator. Oxygen/ozone therapy has a
      long history of research and clinical and therapeutic applications
      on humans. The first medical application was in 1870 when Lender
      purified blood in test tubes. Medical applications became
      widespread throughout Europe and America. As of 1929, more than
      114 diseases were listed for treatment with oxygen/ozone. In 1930,
      Fisch, used ozone on a regular basis in his dental practice in
      Switzerland (1).<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.Chemistry of ozone</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone (O3) is a triatomic molecule with three oxygen atoms and
      molecular weight of 47.98 g/mol. Thermodynamically, this molecule
      is a highly instable compound that decomposes to pure oxygen with
      a short half-life in particular temperature and pressure
      conditions (2). Ozone is 1.6-fold denser and 10-fold more soluble
      in water (49 mL in 100 mL water at 0°C) than oxygen. Although
      ozone is not a radical molecule, it is the third most potent
      oxidant after fluorine and per sulfate. Ozone is an unstable gas
      that cannot be stored and should be used at once because it has a
      half-life of 40 min at 20°C (2). Ozone is naturally produced by
      the photo dissociation of molecular oxygen (O2) into activated
      oxygen atoms, which then react with further oxygen molecules. This
      transient radical anion rapidly becomes protonated, generating
      hydrogen trioxide (HO3), which, in turn, decomposes to an even
      more powerful oxidant, the hydroxyl radical (OH) (3). It is the
      fundamental form of oxygen that occurs naturally as a result of
      ultraviolet energy or lightning, causing a temporary recombination
      of oxygen atoms into groups of three. In the clinical setting, an
      oxygen/ozone generator simulates lightning via an electrical
      discharge field. Ozone gas has a high oxidation potential and is
      1.5 times more effective than chloride when used as an
      antimicrobial agent against bacteria, viruses, fungi, and
      protozoa. It also has the capacity to stimulate blood circulation
      and the immune response. Ozone has been indicated for the
      treatment of 260 different pathologies (4, 5).<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.Routes of ozone therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone is applied to oral tissues in the following forms: Ozonated
      water, ozonated olive oil, and oxygen/ozone gas. Ozonated water
      and olive oil have the capacity to entrap and then release
      oxygen/ozone; an ideal delivery system. These forms of application
      are used individually or in combination to treat dental disease
      (6).<br>
      <br>
      <b>4.Applications of ozone in medicine</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Most of our knowledge is based on multiple case reports from
      hospitals and clinics. Ozone can enhance both lung function and
      inflammatory airway responses to inhale allergen in cases with
      pre-existing allergic airway diseases (7).<br>
      <br>
      Medicated forms of O3 in a gaseous form are somewhat unusual, and
      that is why special application techniques have had to be
      developed for the safe use of ozone. In other words, due to the
      difficulty in handling and administering gaseous ozone, some
      methods and devices have been introduced to enhance its
      effectiveness. In local applications such as the treatment of
      external wounds, transcutaneous O3 gas bath has been established
      as a most practical and useful method; at low (subatmospheric)
      pressure in a closed system guaranteeing no escape of ozone into
      the ambient air. Ozonized water, whose use is particularly known
      in dental medicine, is optimally applied as a spray or in
      compressed form (8).<br>
      <br>
      Apart from rectal insufflation which is principally used for the
      treatment of intestinal conditions, and also applied systemically,
      autohemotherapy has established itself as a systemic therapy of
      choice. A corresponding dosage of ozone gas is transferred (in the
      form of microbubbles) into 50 to 100 ml of the patient’s blood in
      a sealed, pressure-less system, thus achieving the finest possible
      distribution to reach the greatest possible number of red and
      white blood cells to activate their metabolism. This is a markedly
      low-risk method when hygiene guidelines are observed, disposable
      units are used, and the material used is ozone-resistant. In the
      therapy of pain in the locomotor system, ozone can be applied
      supportively in the form of intramuscular or intra-articular
      injections (2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>5.Ozone in dentistry</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Muller et al. (9) compared the influence of ozone gas with
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) and known antiseptic agents (2%
      Chlorhexidine, 0.5 and 5% sodium hypochlorite solutions) on a
      multispecies oral biofilm in-vitro. The studied bacteria were
      Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Fusobacterium
      nucleatum, Streptococcus (S.) sobrinus, S. oralis and Candida (C.)
      albicans. Gasiform ozone was produced by vacuum ozone delivery
      system Kavo HealOzone (Biberach, Germany). They concluded that the
      matrix-embedded microbial populations in biofilm are well
      protected against antimicrobial agents. Only 5% NaOCl solution was
      able to eliminate all bacteria effectively. Gasiform ozone or PDT
      was not able to significantly reduce or completely eliminate
      bacteria in the biofilm (9). Baysan et al. assessed antimicrobial
      effect of Kavo HealOzone device on primary root caries lesions
      (PRCL) and evaluated the efficiency of ozone specifically on S.
      mutans and S. sobrinus (10). As a result, ozone exposure to either
      10 or 20 s under experimental conditions reduced the total levels
      of microorganisms in the PRCLs to &lt;1% of the control values.
      Application of ozone for a period of 10 s was also capable of
      reducing the numbers of S. mutans and S. sobrinus in-vitro (10).
      Holmes (11) observed the effect of KaVo Healozone device on PRCL
      followed by professionally-applied remineralizing solution
      containing xylitol, fluoride, calcium, phosphate and zinc. This
      treatment modality was applied to 89 patients over 60. After 18
      months 100% of ozone-treated primary root caries lesions (PRCLs)
      had improved. In control group, where lesions were left without
      treatment, only one PRCL had improved. In 62% of cases the status
      remained leathery, while in 37% of PCRL’s had worsened from
      leathery to soft texture (11).<br>
      <br>
      The influence of ozonated water on the epithelial wound healing
      process in the oral cavity was observed by Filippi (12). It was
      found that ozonized water applied on a daily basis can accelerate
      the healing rate in oral mucosa. This effect was seen in the first
      two postoperative days. Daily treatment with ozonized water
      accelerates the physiological healing rate in the treated wounds
      as such changes were not seen in the untreated wounds (12).<br>
      <br>
      <b>6.Ozone in endodontics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone gas in a ~4 g/m3 concentration (HealOzone; KaVo, Biberach,
      Germany) is used clinically for endodontic treatments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>6.1.Antimicrobial activity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Most studies on the applications of ozone in endodontics focus on
      its antimicrobial activity. Nagayoshi et al. (13) found that
      ozonated water (0.5–4 mg/L) was highly effective in killing both
      gram positive and negative micro-organisms. Gram negative
      bacteria, such as Porphyromonas (P.) endodontalis and P.
      gingivalis were substantially more sensitive to ozonated water
      than gram positive oral streptococci and C. albicans in pure
      culture. Hems et al. (14) evaluated the potential of ozone as an
      antibacterial agent using Enterococcus (E.) faecalis as a test
      species. Ozone was used both as gasiform (produced by Pure zone
      device), and aqueous (optimal concentration 0.68 mg/L). They
      concluded that ozone in solution was antibacterial against
      planktonic E. faecalis after 240 s treatment. However it was not
      effective against E. faecalis within a biofilm unless they were
      displaced into the surrounding medium by agitation (14).<br>
      <br>
      Estrela et al. (15) studied antimicrobial effects of ozonated
      water, gaseous ozone and antiseptic agents (2.5% hypochlorite and
      2% chlorhexidine) in infected human dental root canals. Over the
      20 min contact time none of these substances had antibacterial
      effect against E. faecalis in the infected root canals.<br>
      <br>
      Thanomsub et al. (16) tested the effects of ozone treatment on
      cell growth and ultrastructural changes in bacteria (Escherichia
      coli, Salmonella sp., Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus
      subtilis). It was discovered that ozone at 0.167 mg/min/L
      concentration can be used to sterilize water, which is
      contaminated within 30 min with up to 105 cfu/ml bacteria.
      Destroying of bacterial cell membrane was observed, subsequently
      producing intercellular leakage and eventually causing cell lysis.
      Nevertheless, these ozone concentrations have no significant
      effect on the cell viability of bacterial cultures at higher
      concentrations of 106 and 107 CFU/mL (16).<br>
      <br>
      Polydorou et al. (17) found that 80 s as well as 40s applications
      of ozone was effective in eliminating S. mutans. In an animal
      study on the infected dog's teeth, Silveira et al. (2007) showed
      77% root canal treatment success rate when using ozonized oil as
      an intra-canal medicament. A further study evaluated the
      effectiveness of ozonated water in the elimination of C. albicans,
      E. faecalis, and endotoxins from root canals (18). Findings
      revealed that ozonated water was effective against both C.
      albicans and E. faecalis immediately after treatment; however it
      did not have substantivity. Furthermore, ozonated water
      demonstrated no anti-endotoxin activity. The disinfecting effect
      of ozonized oxygen (120 s from the HealOzone) on E. faecalis has
      been assessed (19). Findings revealed that ozonized oxygen appears
      to be suitable for disinfecting root canal systems in cases where
      sodium hypochlorite is not indicated. Huth et al. (20) assessed
      the effectiveness of aqueous and gaseous ozone against E.
      faecalis, C. albicans, Peptostreptococcus micros and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa cultured in planktonic media or in mono-species
      biofilms. Results demonstrated that high-concentrated gaseous and
      aqueous ozone was dose-, strain- and time-dependently effective
      against the tested microorganisms. The antibacterial activity of
      gaseous ozone was shown to be greater than KTP laser and less than
      NaOCl (21) and ozone gas delivered into irrigating fluids in the
      root canal may be useful as an adjunct for endodontic disinfection
      (22).<br>
      <br>
      <b>7.Effects on dentin bonding</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Schmidlin et al. (23) evaluated the influence of direct high-dose
      gaseous ozone application (2100 ppm) on dentin and enamel shear
      bond strength; despite a possible retention of surface and
      subsurface oxide-related substances during high-dose ozone
      application, the strength was not impaired. Thus, adhesive
      restoration placement should be possible immediately after ozone
      application for cavity disinfection. However, other researchers
      reported that adhesion of the self-adhesive resin cement RelyX
      Unicem (3M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) was significantly reduced after
      using gaseous ozone (24).<br>
      <br>
      Magni et al. (25) indicated that Ozone gas did not compromise the
      mechanical properties of the adhesives [including Prime &amp; Bond
      NT (Dentsply), Excite (Ivoclar-Vivadent), Syntac/Heliobond
      (Ivoclar-Vivadent) and Silorane System Adhesive (3 M-ESPE)]. When
      ozone gas was used to disinfect the cavity before a restoration,
      it had no influence on immediate enamel and dentin bond strength
      (26). Çehreli et al. (27) revealed that pre-treatment with ozone
      improved the marginal sealing ability of the fissure sealants;
      another study demonstrated that ozone therapy improved shear bond
      strength of AH-26 and EX Fill root canal sealers (28). Gurgan et
      al. (29) showed that ozone treatment did not impaired the shear
      bond strength of two self-etch adhesives (Clearfil SE Bond and
      Clearfil Tri-S Bond) used on coronal and radicular dentin. However
      other studies showed that ozone decreased the microtensile bond
      strength of dentin-composite resin interface (30) and reduced the
      initial microtensile bond strength of Clearfil SE Bond (31).
      According to Arslan et al. (32) ozone did not significantly affect
      the dentin bond strength of a silorane-based resin composite,
      filtek supreme. Also, another study revealed that ozone gas and
      ozonated water had no deleterious effects on the bond strengths
      and interfaces (33).<br>
      <br>
      <b>8.Toxicity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone inhalation can be toxic to the pulmonary system and other
      organs. Complications caused by ozone therapy are infrequent at
      0.0007 per application. Known side-effects are epiphora, upper
      respiratory irritation, rhinitis, cough, headache, occasional
      nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, blood vessel swelling, poor
      circulation, heart problems and even stroke. Because of ozone's
      high oxidative power, all materials that come in contact with the
      gas must be ozone resistant, such as glass, silicon, and Teflon.
      However, in the event of ozone intoxication, the patient must be
      placed in the supine position and treated with vitamin E and
      N-acetylcysteine (2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>9.Contra-indications of ozone therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following conditions mentioned in the medical literatures
      contraindicate ozone use e.g. acute alcohol intoxication, recent
      myocardial infarction, hemorrhage in any organ, pregnancy,
      hyperthyroidism, thrombocytopenia and ozone allergy (2-4).<br>
      <br>
      <b>10.Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone is applied to oral tissues in various forms: ozonated water,
      ozonated olive oil, and oxygen/ozone gas. Ozone has been used in
      medicine extensively. In dentistry, its effectiveness on wound
      healing, antibacterial activity, and its effect on dentin bonding
      has been investigated. Ozone improves wound healing, assists in
      treating root caries and can be used against endodontic
      microbiota. Furthermore, it seems that ozone does not have
      significant adverse effect on dentin bonding. In spite of
      infrequency of side effects, ozone therapy may cause serious
      medical complications if incorrectly used. Therefore care must be
      taken when handling ozone.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gingival and Periodontal diseases represent a major concern both
      in dentistry and medicine. The majority of the contributing
      factors and causes in the etiology of these diseases are reduced
      or treated with ozone in all its application forms (gas, water,
      oil). The beneficial biological effects of ozone, its
      anti-microbial activity, oxidation of bio-molecules precursors and
      microbial toxins implicated in periodontal diseases and its
      healing and tissue regeneration properties, make the use of ozone
      well indicated in all stages of gingival and periodontal diseases.
      The primary objective of this article is to provide a general
      review about the clinical applications of ozone in periodontics.
      The secondary objective is to summarize the available in vitro and
      in vivo studies in Periodontics in which ozone has been used. This
      objective would be of importance to future researchers in terms of
      what has been tried and what the potentials are for the clinical
      application of ozone in Periodontics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The word ozone comes from the Greek “ozein” meaning odorant. Ozone
      (also known as triatomic oxygen and trioxygen) is an allotropic
      form of oxygen occurring naturally in the Earth’s atmosphere. It
      surrounds the Earth at an altitude of between 50,000 and 100,000
      feet. [1] It is created in nature when ultraviolet rays cause
      oxygen atoms to temporarily recombine in groups of three. It is
      also formed by the action of electrical discharges on oxygen, so
      it is often created by thunder and lightning.<br>
      <br>
      It has got the capacity to absorb the harmful ultra-violet rays
      present in the light spectrum from the Sun. It is a pale blue gas
      that condenses to a deep blue liquid at very low temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone is an unstable gas and it quickly gives up nascent Oxygen
      molecule to form Oxygen gas. Due to the property of releasing
      nascent Oxygen, it has been used in human medicine since long back
      to kill bacteria, fungi, to inactivate viruses and to control
      hemorrhages. [2] Medical grade ozone is made from pure medical
      oxygen. It is produced commercially in ozone generators, which
      involves sending an electrical discharge through a specially-built
      condenser containing oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      First discovered until 1840 by the German chemist Christian
      Frederick Schonbein at the University of Basil in Switzerland,
      ozone was first used in medicine in 1870 by Landler. However, it
      was not until 1932 that ozone was seriously studied by the
      scientific community, when ozonated water was used as a
      disinfectant by Dr. E. A. Fisch, [3] a Swiss dentist. Fisch had
      the first idea to use ozone as either a gas or ozonated water in
      his practice. By a twist of fate, a surgeon, Dr. E Payr
      (1871–1946) had to be treated for a gangrenous pulpite and
      remained astonished by the result achieved with local ozone
      treatment. He enthusiastically extended its application to general
      surgery.<br>
      <br>
      At the time, ozone therapy was difficult and limited due to the
      lack of ozone-resistant materials, such as Nylon, Dacron, and
      Teflon, until 1950 when ozone-resistant materials were
      manufactured. At that time Joachim Hänsler, a German physicist and
      physician, joined another German physician, Hans Wolff, to develop
      the first ozone generator for medical use. Their design continues
      to be the basis for modern equipment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ozone generators</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There are three different systems for generating ozone gas: [4]<br>
      <br>
      • Ultraviolet System: produces low concentrations of ozone, used
      in esthetics, saunas, and for air purification.<br>
      <br>
      • Cold Plasma System: used in air and water purification.<br>
      <br>
      • Corona Discharge System: produces high concentrations of ozone.
      It is the most common system used in the medical/ dental field. It
      is easy to handle and it has a controlled ozone production rate.<br>
      <br>
      Medical grade ozone is a mixture of pure oxygen and pure ozone in
      the ratio of 0.05% to 5% of 3 and 95% to 99.95% of O2. Due to the
      instability of the 3 molecule, medical grade ozone must be
      prepared immediately before use. Within less than an hour after
      preparation only half of the mixture is still ozone while the
      other half is transformed into oxygen. As a result, it is
      impossible to store ozone over long periods of time. In order to
      control the decomposition of 3 into oxygen it can be associated
      with a vehicle with aqueous properties to promote the conversion
      more quickly or with a vehicle with more viscous properties to
      retard the conversion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Use of ozone in dentistry</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The use of ozone in dentistry is gaining its place in every day's
      dental practice and is used in almost all dental applications. The
      undisputed disinfection power of ozone over other antiseptics
      makes the use of ozone in dentistry a very good alternative and/or
      an additional disinfectant to standard antiseptics.<br>
      <br>
      Due to safety concerns, 3 gas was not recommended for intra-oral
      use. Only dissolved ozone in water and ozonated oils were and are
      still commonly used in different fields of dentistry. With the
      development of a foot pedal-activated dental handpiece with a
      suction feature, 3 gas can now be used safely in situations where
      diffusion is an important factor, i.e. dental hard tissues.<br>
      <br>
      According to German dentist Fritz Kramer, [5] ozone, such as in
      the form of ozonated water, can be used in the following ways.<br>
      <br>
      1. as a powerful disinfectant<br>
      <br>
      2. in its ability to control bleeding<br>
      <br>
      3. in its ability to cleanse wounds in bones and soft tissues.<br>
      <br>
      4. by increasing the local supply of oxygen to the wound area,
      ozone can improve healing.<br>
      <br>
      5. ozonated water can increase temperature in the area of the
      wound, and this increase the metabolic processes related to wound
      healing.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Kramer points out that ozonated water can be used in a number
      of different ways:<br>
      <br>
      1. as a mouth rinse (especially in cases of gingivitis,
      paradentosis, thrush or stomatitis);<br>
      <br>
      2. as a spray to cleanse the affected area, and to disinfect oral
      mucosa, cavities and in general dental surgery;<br>
      <br>
      3. as an ozone/water jet to clean cavities of teeth being capped,
      receiving root canal therapy, and in treating painful gingivitis
      and stomatitis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Biological actions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The application of ozone in dentistry comes as a result of
      physico-chemical properties: There are several known actions of
      ozone on human body, such as immunostimulating and analgesic,
      antihypoxic and detoxicating, antimicrobial, bioenergetic and
      biosynthetic (activation of the metabolism of carbohydrates,
      proteins, lipids) etc. [6]<br>
      <br>
      1. Antimicrobial effect- Ozone works destructively against
      bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The antimicrobial effect of ozone is
      a result of its action on cells by damaging its cytoplasmic
      membrane due to ozonolysis of dual bonds and also ozone-induced
      modification of intracellular contents (oxidation of proteins loss
      of organelle function) because of secondary oxidants effects. This
      action is non-specific and selective to microbial cells; it does
      not damage human body cells because of their major antioxidative
      ability. Ozone is very efficient in antibiotics resistant strains.
      Its antimicrobial activity increases in liquid environment of the
      acidic pH. In viral infections the ozone action lies in the
      intolerance of infected cells to peroxides and change of activity
      of reverse transcriptase, which takes part in synthesis of viral
      proteins. [6] Being a very strong oxidant it joins with
      biomolecules containing cysterine, cysteine, methionine, histidine
      (all being part of bacterial cell membranes. The main targets of
      their attack are the thiol groups of the amino acid cysteine. As a
      result of the reaction of ozone with unsaturated fatty acids of a
      lipid sheath of a virus the lipid sheath of a virus melts. The
      research shows that a few-second-application of ozone stops all
      vital functions of bacteria which are incapable of developing any
      self-immunity to its action. Gram+ (Gram-positive) bacteria are
      more sensitive to the action of ozone than Gram– (Gram-negative)
      bacteria. Oxygen-free bacteria react to ozone as well. Among
      cariogenic bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus
      sobrinus are the most sensitive. Ozone easily acts on multi
      unsaturated fatty acids which occur in virus sheaths. Ozone reacts
      also with ascorbinians and tocopherols. [7]<br>
      <br>
      2. Immunostimulating Effect- Ozone influences cellular and humoral
      immune system. It stimulates proliferation of immunocompetent
      cells and synthesis of immunoglobulins. It also activates function
      of macrophages and increases sensitivity of micro-organisms to
      phagocytosis. [6] As a response to this activation through ozone,
      the body's immune cells produce special messengers called
      cytokines. These molecules in turn activate other immune cells,
      setting off a cascade of positive change throughout the immune
      system, which is stimulated to resist diseases. This means that
      the application of medical ozone is extremely useful for immune
      activation in patients with a low immune status and/or immune
      deficit. [8] Ozone causes the synthesis of biologically active
      substances such as interleukins, leukotrienes and prostaglandins
      which is beneficial in reducing inflammation and wound healing.
      [6] Ozone in high concentration causes immunodepressive effect
      whereas in its low concentration immunostimulating effect. [7]<br>
      <br>
      3. Antihypoxic effect- Ozone brings about the rise of pO2 in
      tissues and improves transportation of oxygen in blood, which
      results in change of cellular metabolism – activation of aerobic
      processes (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, ß-oxidation of fatty acids)
      and use of energetic resources. Repeating low doses of ozone
      activate enzymes: super-oxide dismutases, catalases,
      dehydrogenase, and glutatione peroxidases. They are part of
      complex enzymatic systems which protect organisms against the
      action of oxygen-free radicals. It also prevents formation of
      erythrocytes aggregates and increases their contact surface for
      oxygen transportation. Its ability to stimulate the circulation is
      used in the treatment of circulatory disorders and makes it
      valuable in the revitalizing organic functions. [6] Ozone improves
      the metabolism of inflamed tissues by increasing their oxygenation
      and reducing local inflammatory processes. By changing the cell
      membrane structure of erythrocytes and causing the increase of its
      negative charge it influences the structure change as well as
      blood cell elasticity. This in consequence reduces blood cell
      rolling and enables blood flow in capillary vessels. By increasing
      the concentration of 2,3 Diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), ozone
      changes the configuration of erythrocytes, which enables them to
      return oxygen in the inflamed tissue. [7]<br>
      <br>
      4. Biosynthetic Effect- It activates mechanisms of protein
      synthesis, increases amount of ribosomes and mitochondria in
      cells. These changes on the cellular level explain elevation of
      functional activity and regeneration potential of tissues and
      organs. [6]<br>
      <br>
      5. Ozone causes secretion of vasodilators such as NO, which is
      responsible for dilatation of arterioles and venules. [6] It also
      activates angiogenesis. [7]<br>
      <br>
      6. Ozone, when acting on the organic substance of mineralized
      tooth tissues intensifies their remineralization potential. At the
      same time, it is capable of “opening” dentinal tubules, which
      enables the diffusion of calcium and phosphorus ions to the deeper
      layers of carious cavities. [9]<br>
      <br>
      A high concentration of ozone kills bacteria very quickly and is
      thousand times more powerful than other bacterial killing agents.
      The average concentration of ozone used in treatments is 25 gm of
      ozone per milliliter of oxygen/ozone gas mixture that translates
      into 0.25 parts of ozone to 99.75 parts of oxygen. Evidence-based
      research has shown that at this concentration, ozone effectively
      kills bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites. [10] As an
      antimicrobial agent, it is a powerful oxidizer at a dramatically
      lower concentration than chlorine with none of the toxic side
      effects. One molecule of ozone is equal to between 3,000 to 10,000
      molecules of chlorine and it kills pathogenic organisms 3,500
      times faster. [10] Studies have revealed that it only takes 10 sec
      to kill 99 % of bacteria, fungi and viruses. [11] It can oxidize
      many organic compounds and it is a powerful germicide. [12] Some
      of the other effects are circulatory enhancement, disruption of
      tumor metabolism and stimulation of oxygen metabolism. [13]<br>
      <br>
      According to most authors, a 10-sec-application of ozone causes
      the destruction of 99% of bacteria, and a 20-sec-application even
      of 99.9%. In this way, so-called ecological niche appears.<br>
      <br>
      However, it is not conducive to their repeated colonization within
      4 to 6 weeks. [14,15] Ozone is not toxic when it is given in the
      amount of 0.05 ppm for 8 hours. During ozone therapy a maximum
      concentration of ozone in oral cavity amounts to 0.01 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Goals of ozone therapy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Setting the standard-of-care and therapeutic goals are based on
      sound evidence-based science is critical. Therapeutic goals are
      inclusive and not exclusive of standard of care. The goals of
      oxygen/ozone therapy are: [10]<br>
      <br>
      1. Elimination of pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      2. Restoration of proper oxygen metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      3. Induction of a friendly ecologic environment.<br>
      <br>
      4. Increased circulation.<br>
      <br>
      5. Immune activation.<br>
      <br>
      6. Simulation of the humoral anti-oxidant system.<br>

      <b>Appliances producing ozone for dental use</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1. HealOzone by KaVo is air-based and the application of the gas
      takes place in a closed circuit. Its surplus is sucked out and
      neutralized by manganese ions. The concentration of ozone in the
      cap adjacent to the tissue amounts to 2100 ppm. Perfect air
      tightness of the cap is necessary for the application of ozone.
      Therefore, the application is only possible on the surfaces where
      such air tightness can be provided.<br>
      <br>
      2. OzonyTron by MYMED Gmb H. - Oxygen activation generator
      (OzonytronX—Biozonix, München, Germany) uses the power of high
      frequency and voltage. Activated oxygen (ozone) concentration can
      be adjusted in 5 levels via current strength. Inside the glass
      probe, which is formed by a double glass camera, is a noble gasses
      mixture that is conducting and emitting electromagnetic energy.
      When the tip of the probe gets in contact with the body it emits
      energy around the treated area and splits environmental diatomic
      oxygen in singular atomic oxygen and ozone. The concentration of
      ozone in the operation field is 10 to 100 µg/ml (becomes a fungi-,
      viru-, and bacteriocide at the intensity of 1–5 µg/ml). There is
      no closed circuit here, therefore, ozone can be applied to the
      places that are difficult to reach, e.g. gingival pockets or root
      canals.<br>
      <br>
      3. Product photo (Prozone) by W&amp;H - It is characterized by its
      ease of use and safety of application (preset tissue-compatible
      dosages in the indication areas of periodontitis and
      endodontitis). Prozone ensures a hygienic procedure during the
      gassing of the pockets due to its exchangeable plastic attachments
      (Perio tips or Endo tips).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Route of ozone administration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      1. Gaseous Ozone - Gaseous ozone is most frequently used in
      restorative dentistry and endodontics. Topical administration of
      the gaseous form can be via an open system or via a sealing
      suction system as a prerequisite to avoid inhalation and adverse
      effects. Ozone appears to be an integral part of noninvasive
      therapy of dental caries, as a disinfectant prior to placing a
      direct restoration and as therapy for hypomineralized teeth. [16]<br>
      <br>
      2. Ozonated Water - Ozonated water has been shown to be very
      effective against bacteria, fungi and viruses and is also less
      expensive compared to other chemical cleaners. [17] Gaseous ozone
      was shown to be a more effective microbicide than the aqueous form
      and, applied for 3 min, may be used as a dental disinfectant. [18]
      Because ozone gas has been found to have toxic effects if inhaled
      into the respiratory tract, [16,18,19] ozonated water may be
      useful to control oral infections and various pathogens.[15]<br>
      <br>
      3. Ozonized Oil - In addition to ozone application in its gaseous
      and aqueous form, sunflower ozonized oil also seems extremely
      convenient. The wide accessibility of sunflower oil makes it a
      competitive antimicrobial agent. Ozonized oil (Oleozone,
      Bioperoxoil) has shown to be effective against Staphylococci,
      Streptococci, Enterococci, Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli and
      especially Mycobacteria [16,20,21] and has been utilized for the
      cure of fungal infections. [16,20]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ozone therapy in periodontics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The main use of ozone in dentistry relies on its antimicrobial
      properties. It is proved to be effective against both Gram
      positive and Gram negative bacteria, viruses and fungi. [22]<br>
      <br>
      Ebensberger et al [23] evaluated the effect of irrigation with
      ozonated water on the proliferation of cells in the periodontal
      ligament adhering to the root surfaces of 23 freshly extracted
      completely erupted third molars. The teeth were randomly treated
      by intensive irrigation with ozonated water for 2 min or
      irrigation with a sterile isotonic saline solution, serving as a
      control group. The periodontal cells of these teeth were studied
      immunohistochemically to mark proliferating cell nuclear antigen
      (PCNA). It was observed that the labeling index (the number of
      positive cells compared to the total number of cells suggesting
      enhancement of metabolism) was higher among the teeth irrigated
      with ozone (7.8% vs. 6.6%); however, the difference was not
      statistically significant (p = 0.24). They concluded that the 2
      min irrigation of the avulsed teeth with non-isotonic ozonated
      water might lead not only to a mechanical cleansing, but also
      decontaminate the root surface, with no negative effect on
      periodontal cells remaining on the tooth surface.<br>
      <br>
      Nagayoshi et al [24] examined the effect of ozonated water on oral
      microorganisms and dental plaque. Dental plaque samples were
      treated with 4mL of ozonated water for 10 s. they observed that
      ozonated water was effective for killing gram-positive and
      gram-negative oral microorganisms and oral Candida albicans in
      pure culture as well as bacteria in plaque biofilm and therefore
      might be useful to control oral infectious microorganisms in
      dental plaque.<br>
      <br>
      Nagayoshi et al [17] tested the efficacy of three different
      concentrations of ozone water (0.5, 2, and 4 mg/ml in distilled
      water) on the time-dependent inactivation of cariogenic,
      periodontopathogenic and endodontopathogenic microbes
      (Streptococcus, Porphyromonas gingivalis and endodontalis,
      Actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, Candida albicans) in culture
      and in biofilms. They confirm that ozonated water was highly
      effective in killing of both gram positive and gram negative
      micro-organisms.<br>
      <br>
      Depending on the dosage, the oral microbes were inactivated after
      10 seconds. Gram negative anaerobes, such as Porphyromonas
      endodontalis and Porphyromonas gingivalis were substantially more
      sensitive to ozonated water than gram positive oral streptococci
      and Candida albicans in pure culture. Furthermore ozonated water
      had strong bactericidal activity against bacteria in plaque
      biofilm. In addition, ozonated water inhibited the accumulation of
      experimental dental plaque in vitro.<br>
      <br>
      Ramzy et al [24] irrigated the periodontal pockets by ozonized
      water in 22 patients suffering from aggressive periodontitis (age
      range from 13 to 25 years). Periodontal pockets were irrigated
      with 150 ml of ozonized water over 5 to 10 minutes once weekly,
      for a clinical four weeks study, using a blunt tipped sterile
      plastic syringe. High significant improvement regarding pocket
      depth, plaque index, gingival index and bacterial count was
      recorded related to quadrants treated by scaling and root planning
      together with ozone application. They also reported significant
      reduction in bacterial count in sites treated with ozonized water.<br>
      <br>
      Huth et al [19] in their study declared that the aqueous form of
      ozone, as a potential antiseptic agent, showed less cytotoxicity
      than gaseous ozone or established antimicrobials (chlorhexidine
      digluconate-CHX 2%, 0.2%; sodium hypochlorite-NaOCl 5.25%, 2.25%;
      hydrogen peroxide-H2O2 3%) under most conditions. Therefore,
      aqueous ozone fulfils optimal cell biological characteristics in
      terms of biocompatibility for oral application.<br>
      <br>
      Huth et al [26] in their later paper examined the effect of ozone
      on the influence on the host immune response. These researchers
      chose the NF-kappaB system, a paradigm for inflammation-associated
      signalling/transcription. Their results showed that that NF-kappaB
      activity in oral cells in periodontal ligament tissue from root
      surfaces of periodontally damaged teeth was inhibited following
      incubation with ozonized medium. The Huth 2007 study establishes a
      condition under which aqueous ozone exerts inhibitory effects on
      the NF-kappaB system, suggesting that it has an anti-inflammatory
      capacity.<br>
      <br>
      Muller et al [27] compared the influence of ozone gas with
      photodynamic therapy (PDT) and known antiseptic agents (2%
      Chlorhexidine, 0,5 and 5% hypochlorate solutions) on a
      multispecies oral biofilm in vitro. The following bacteria were
      studied – Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar,
      Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus
      oralis and Candida albicans. Gasiform ozone was produced by vacuum
      ozone delivery system Kavo Healozone. They concluded that the
      matrix-embedded microbial populations in biofilm are well
      protected towards antimicrobial agents. Only 5 % Hypochlorate
      solution was able to eliminate all bacteria effectively. Usage of
      gasiform ozone or PDT was not able to reduce significantly or
      completely eliminate bacteria in the biofilm.<br>
      <br>
      Kronusová [28] used ozone in following cases: prevention of dental
      caries in fissures of the first permanent molars in children,
      application of ozone in prepared cavity, after tooth extraction,
      in case of postextractional complications, in patients with
      chronic gingivitis, periodontitis and periodontal abscesses,
      herpes labialis, purulent periodontitis, dentition difficilis,
      etc. Almost all patients with gingivitis showed subjective and
      objective improvement of their status, as well as patients with
      periodontal abscess, where no exsudation was observed. Application
      of ozone after tooth extraction was found also quite useful – only
      10 % of patients suffered from such complication as alveolitis
      sicca, but even in these cases the clinical course was shorter and
      more moderate.<br>
      <br>
      The influence of ozonized water on the epithelial wound healing
      process in the oral cavity was observed by Filippi. [29] It was
      found that ozonized water applied on the daily basis can
      accelerate the healing rate in oral mucosa. This effect can be
      seen in the first two postoperative days. The comparison with
      wounds without treatment shows that daily treatment with ozonized
      water accelerates the physiological healing rate.<br>
      <br>
      In the study by Karapetian et al, [30] periimplantitis treatment
      with conventional, surgical and ozone therapy methods was
      investigated, and it was found that the most effective bacteria
      reduction was in the ozone-treated patient group. The authors
      concluded that the main challenge seems to be the decontamination
      of the implant surface, its surrounding tissue and the prevention
      of recolonization with periodontal pathogenic bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Kshitish and Laxman [31] conducted a randomized, double-blind,
      crossover split-mouth study on 16 patients suffering from
      generalized chronic periodontitis. The study period of 18 days was
      divided into two time-intervals, i.e. baseline (0 days) to 7th
      day, with a washout period of 4 days followed by a second time
      interval of 7 days.<br>
      <br>
      Subgingival irrigation of each half of the mouth with either ozone
      or chlorhexidine was done at different time intervals. They
      observed a higher percentage of reduction in plaque index (12%),
      gingival index (29%) and bleeding index (26%) using ozone
      irrigation as compared to chlorhexidine. The percentile reduction
      of Aa (25%) using ozone was appreciable as compared to no change
      in Aa occurrence using chlorhexidine. By using 3 and
      chlorhexidine, there was no antibacterial effect on Porphyromonas
      gingivalis (Pg) and Tannerella forsythensis. The antifungal effect
      of ozone from baseline (37%) to 7th day (12.5%) was pronounced
      during the study period, unlike CHX, which did not demonstrate any
      antifungal effect. No antiviral property of ozone was observed.
      The antiviral efficacy of chlorhexidine was better than that of
      ozone. They concluded that despite the substantivity of
      chlorhexidine, the single irrigation of ozone is quite effective
      to inactivate microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Application modalities</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      According to the clinical case, different applications modalities
      are available using ozone gas, irrigation with ozonated water and
      in-office use of ozonized oil as well as home use.<br>
      <br>
      Gas application via a customized thermoformed dental appliance- A
      customized suckdown thermoformed hard or medium-soft dental
      appliance can be prepared. It should extend 2-3 mm beyond the
      affected gingival area, leaving a free space for gas circulation.
      2 ports should be attached for the gas inlet and outlet
      respectively at the distal and mesial of the treatment area. The
      edges of the appliance should be reclined with light or medium
      body silicone. Light-cured dam can also be applied as an extra
      safety precaution to completely seal the borders. The ports to the
      generator and the suction pump should then be attached. This
      procedure will treat both hard and soft tissues of the affected
      area. PVC or silicone cap can be used to treat individually all
      the indicated areas in difficult situations where such an
      appliance is hard to use or uncomfortable to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      Irrigation with Ozonated Water- Ozonated water can be used to
      irrigate the affected area during and after scaling, root surface
      planning, and non-surgical pocket curettage.<br>
      <br>
      In-office and Home Use of Ozonized Olive Oil- After in-office
      treatment with ozone gas or ozonated water, pockets can be filled
      with ozonized olive oil using a blunt 25G needle or any other
      appropriate tip. Patient can be given some of the oils for home
      use. In-office ozonized oil application can be repeated once a
      week.<br>
      <br>
      Surgical Procedures- Ozonated water can be used as an irrigant
      during the surgical procedure and/or as a final surgical site
      lavage. The sutures can be covered with a thin layer of ozonized
      oil and the patient can be instructed to apply the oil 3-4 times a
      day.<br>
      <br>
      Peri-Implantitis- Peri-implantitis is very bothering to both the
      dentist and the patient. After thorough assessment and if a
      decision is taken to salvage the case, different modes of therapy
      are used in order to save the implant from total loss. Laser
      and/or manual debridement along with antiseptic solutions and
      topical anti-microbial medicines are commonly performed with a
      varying degree of success. Ozone can play an important role and be
      used as gas or in aqueous form. An appropriate length of PVC or
      silicone cap can be cut to cover the abutment fully. It should
      properly seal the gingival borders around the implant. Ozone gas
      infiltrations can also be used in this situation. Ozonated water
      can be used as an irrigant during debridement and curettage.
      Patient can be advised to apply ozonized oil on the treated area
      3-4 times/day.<br>
      Desensitization of sensitive root necks [2]<br>
      <br>
      Quick and prompt relief from root sensitivity has been documented
      after ozone spray for 60 seconds followed by mineral wash onto the
      exposed dentine in a repetitive manner. This desensitization of
      dentine lasts for longer period of time. Smear layer present over
      the exposed root surface prevents the penetration of ionic Calcium
      and Fluorine deep into the dentinal tubules. Ozone removes this
      smear layer, opens up the dentinal tubules, broadens their
      diameter and then Calcium and Fluoride ions flow into the tubules
      easily, deeply and effectively to plug the dentinal tubules,
      preventing the fluid exchange through these tubules. Thus, ozone
      can effectively terminate the root sensitivity problem within
      seconds and also lasts longer than those by conventional methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ozone toxicity</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ozone inhalation can be toxic to the pulmonary system and other
      organs. Complications caused by ozone therapy are infrequent at
      0.0007 per application. Known side-effects are epiphora, upper
      respiratory irritation, rhinitis, cough, headache, occasional
      nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, blood vessel swelling, poor
      circulation, heart problems and at times stroke. [44] Because of
      ozone's high oxidative power, all materials that come in contact
      with the gas must be ozone resistant, such as glass, silicon, and
      Teflon. However, in the event of ozone intoxication the patient
      must be placed in the supine position, and treated with vitamin E
      and n-acetylcysteine. [16]<br>
      <b><br>
        Contraindications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The following are contraindications for use of ozone therapy: [4]<br>

      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Gingivitis and periodontitis are characterized by a local hypoxia
      of tissues and also by various microbic florae that may contain
      over 500 species. Accumulations of bacterial plaque in the
      gingival crevice area in an increased amount causes changes in the
      oral cavity ecology leading to both gingivitis and periodontitis.
      [33]<br>
      <br>
      Dental biofilm makes it difficult for antibiotics in targeting
      putative periodontal pathogens. Higher concentrations of
      antibiotics are required to kill these organisms which are
      inevitably associated with toxic adverse effect on the host
      microbial flora. The application of ozone therapy in periodontics
      showed promising results. Both gaseous and aqueous ozone are used
      as a substitute to mechanical debridement. Ozone can be used to
      help treat periodontal disease by using ozonated water flushed
      below the gum line and/or ozone gas infiltrated into the gum
      tissue and supporting tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Ozonated water (4mg/l) strongly inhibited the formation of dental
      plaque and reduced the number of sub gingival pathogens both gram
      positive and gram negative organisms. Gram negative bacteria, such
      as P. endodontalis and P. gingivalis were substantially more
      sensitive to ozonated water than gram positive oral streptococci
      and C. albicans in pure culture. [17] Furthermore ozonated water
      had strong bactericidal activity against bacteria in plaque
      biofilm. In addition, ozonated water inhibited the accumulation of
      experimental dental plaque in vitro. [17]<br>
      <br>
      Dental researchers have started to examine the effects of ozonated
      fluids in periodontal disease. Huth et al in two papers in 2006
      [19] and 2007 [26] examined the effect of ozone on periodontal
      tissues. The 2007 paper compared traditional periodontal
      anti-microbial products with the use of ozonated water. Both
      papers concluded that ozonated water has an excellent
      anti-microbial effect.<br>
      <br>
      It resulted in toxic effect on human oral epithelial and
      fibroblast cells compared to antiseptics such as chlorehexidine
      digluconate, sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide during a
      1-minute time period. [34,35] Ozone gas found to be toxic to the
      human oral epithelial and gingival fibroblast cells and aqueous
      ozone was more biocompatible than gaseous ozone. [19] The
      application of ozone therapy in chronic gingival and periodontal
      diseases, showed subjective and objective improvement of their
      status, as well as patients with periodontal abscess, with no
      exudation was observed. [36]<br>
      <br>
      Brauner [37] has demonstrated that the combination of professional
      tooth cleaning and daily rinsing of the mouth with ozone water can
      improve clinical findings in cases of gingivitis and
      periodontitis. Plaque indices and a tendency to bleed, however,
      quickly return if the professional measures are interrupted.
      Rinsing the mouth with ozone water without any mechanical
      procedures for plaque reduction were unsuccessful.<br>
      <br>
      There are many benefits to control oral hygiene and as a source of
      sterile water. However, patients should also be informed that
      there is an interaction of aqueous ozone with anti-microbials.
      This research has been published, illustrating the importance of
      potential interactions of dissolved ozone and prescribed
      anti-microbials. Patients who are taking a course of antibiotics
      may need to be informed that the use of ozonated water inactivates
      antibacterial agents [28] and in particular amoxicillin, [29]
      progesterone [30] and tetracycline. [31] What concerns the
      dentists is that ozone may inactivate the anti-microbial effects
      of triclosan. [32]<br>
      <br>
      The effect of ozone on wounds obtained in the process of surgical
      and implantological procedures is used to prevent complications
      like after-surgical infection and to conduce to proper tissue
      healing. The use of ozone around implants is supported by
      published research showing that ozone not only effectively
      sterilizes the surfaces of both the implant and bone, but also
      switches on the reparative mechanisms allowing tissue regeneration
      around implant surfaces. [43] According to Matsumura et al [44,45]
      ozone does not have a major impact on stimulation of gingival
      cells for osteoblastic activity in the regeneration of the
      periodontium around implants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dentistry is changing as we are now using modern science to
      practice dentistry. In comparison with classical medicine
      modalities such as antibiotics and disinfectants, ozone therapy is
      quite inexpensive, predictable and conservative. The ozone therapy
      has been more beneficial than present conventional therapeutic
      modalities. This state of the art technology allows us to take a
      minimally invasive and conservative approach to dental treatment.
      The elucidation of molecular mechanisms of ozone further benefits
      practical application in dentistry. Treating patients with ozone
      therapy reduces the treatment time with a great deal of difference
      and it eliminates the bacterial count more precisely. The
      treatment is completely painless and increases the patients'
      acceptability and compliance with minimal adverse effects.
      Although more clinical research has to be done to standardize
      indications and treatment procedures of ozone therapy, still many
      different approaches are so promising, or already established,
      that hopefully the use of ozone therapy becomes a standard
      treatment for disinfection of an operation sites in dentistry.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>The oral cavity appears as an open ecosystem, with a dynamic
      balance between the entrance of microorganisms, colonization
      modalities, and host defenses aimed to their removal: To avoid
      elimination, bacteria need to adhere to either hard dental
      surfaces or epithelial surfaces. The oral biofilm formation and
      development, and the inside selection of specific microorganisms
      have been correlated with the most common oral pathologies, such
      as dental caries, periodontal disease, and peri-implantitis. The
      mechanical removal of the biofilm and adjunctive use of antibiotic
      disinfectants or various antibiotics have been the conventional
      methods for periodontal therapy. Ozone (O3) is a triatomic
      molecule, consisting of three oxygen atoms, and its application in
      medicine and dentistry has been indicated for the treatment of 260
      different pathologies. The ozone therapy has been more beneficial
      than present conventional therapeutic modalities that follow a
      minimally invasive and conservative application to dental
      treatment. The exposition of molecular mechanisms of ozone further
      benefits practical function in dentistry.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
        AIM:<br>
        <br>
      </b>The purpose of this review is to present the potential for the
      incorporation of ozone therapy into the practice of dentistry.<br>
      <b><br>
        BACKGROUND:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Ozone gas has a high oxidation potential and is 1.5 times
      greater than chloride when used as an antimicrobial agent against
      bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. It also has the capacity
      to stimulate blood circulation and the immune response. Such
      features justify the current interest in its application in
      medicine and dentistry and have been indicated for the treatment
      of 260 different pathologies. It can be used for the treatment of
      alveolitis as a replacement for antibiotic therapy, as a mouthwash
      for reducing the oral microflora, as well as the adherence of
      microorganisms to tooth surfaces. Ozone has been shown to
      stimulate remineralization of recent caries-affected teeth after a
      period of about six to eight weeks.<br>
      <b><br>
        CONCLUSION:<br>
        <br>
      </b>The future of ozone therapy must focus on the establishment of
      safe and well-defined parameters in accordance with randomized,
      controlled trials to determine the precise indications and
      guidelines in order to treat various medical and dental
      pathologies. Scientific support, as suggested by demonstrated
      studies, for ozone therapy presents a potential for an atraumatic,
      biologically-based treatment for conditions encountered in dental
      practice.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Ozone has been successfully used in medicine because of its
      microbiologic properties for more than 100 years. Its bactericide,
      virucide, and fungicide effects are based on its strong oxidation
      effect with the formation of free radicals as well as its direct
      destruction of almost all microorganisms. In addition, ozone has a
      therapeutic effect that facilitates wound healing and improves the
      supply of blood. For medical purposes, ozone may be applied as a
      gas or dissolved in water. Despite the advantages that the
      therapeutic use of ozone offers, reservations remain in terms of
      its application in the oral and maxillofacial area. Particularly,
      the gaseous application of ozone is critically evaluated because
      of its possible side effects on the respiratory system. The
      objective of this article is to provide an overview of the current
      applications of ozone in dentistry and oral surgery. Research was
      based on peer-reviewed sources found through a Medline/PubMed
      search and other textbooks, reviews, and journals.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Ozone, an allotropic form of oxygen, is successfully used in
      the treatment of different diseases for more than a hundred years.
      It is highly valued for various effects, such as antimicrobial,
      antihypoxic, analgesic, immunostimulating etc. on biological
      systems. These mechanisms of action supported with a lot of case
      reports and scientific studies allow using it in different fields
      of medicine. This review of literature is another attempt to
      summarize different modalities of ozone application in dentistry.
      Further studies are necessary to standardize indications and
      treatment protocols of this promising medical agent.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>The aims of this present study were (1) to assess the
      antimicrobial effect of ozone from a novel ozone-generating device
      (Heolozone, USA) [0.052% (v/v) in air delivered at a rate of 13.33
      ml.s(-1)] on primary root carious lesions (PRCLs) and (2) to
      evaluate the efficacy of ozone specifically on Streptococcus
      mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus. In study 1, 40 soft PRCLs from
      freshly extracted teeth were randomly divided into two groups to
      test the antimicrobial effect on PRCLs from exposure to ozonated
      water for either 10 or 20 s. Half of a lesion was removed using a
      sterile excavator. Subsequently, the remaining lesion was exposed
      to the ozonised water for a period of either 10 or 20 s
      (corresponding to 0. 069 or 0.138 ml of ozone, respectively).
      Using paired Student t tests, a significant (p&lt;0.001) reduction
      (mean +/- SE) was observed in the ozone-treated groups with either
      a 10-second (log(10) 3.57+/-0.37) or 20-second (log(10)
      3.77+/-0.42) ozone application compared with the control groups
      (log(10) 5.91+/-0.15 and log(10) 6.18+/-0.21, respectively). In
      study 2, 40 sterile saliva-coated glass beads were randomly
      divided into two groups for each micro-organism. One glass bead
      was put into each bijou bottle with 3 ml of Todd-Hewitt broth. S.
      mutans and S. sobrinus were inoculated anaerobically overnight.
      Each glass bead was then washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered
      saline. Immediately, 10 s of ozone gas was applied to each glass
      bead in the test groups. There was a significant (p&lt;0.0001)
      reduction (mean +/- SE) in ozone-treated samples for S. mutans
      (log(10) 1.01+/-0.27) and S. sobrinus (log(10) 1.09+/-0.36)
      compared with the control samples (log(10) 3.93+/-0.07 and log(10)
      4.61+/-0.13, respectively). This treatment regime is an effective,
      quick, conservative and simple method to kill micro-organisms in
      PRCLs. Ozone gas application for a period of 10 s was also capable
      of reducing the numbers of S. mutans and S. sobrinus on
      saliva-coated glass beads in vitro.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
        OBJECTIVE:<br>
        <br>
      </b>To assess the effect of an ozone delivery system, combined
      with the daily use of a remineralising patient kit, on the
      clinical severity of non-cavitated leathery primary root carious
      lesions (PRCL's), in an older population group.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESIGN:<br>
        <br>
      </b>A total of 89 subjects, (age range 60-82, mean +/- SD, 70.8
      +/- 6 years), each with two leathery PRCL's, were recruited. The
      two lesions in each subject were randomly assigned for treatment
      with ozone or air, in a double-blind design, in a general dental
      practice. Subjects were recalled at three, six, 12 and 18 months.
      Lesions were clinically recorded at each visit as soft, leathery
      or hard, scored with a validated root caries severity index.<br>
      <b><br>
        RESULTS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>There were no observed adverse events. After three months, in
      the ozone-treated group, 61 PRCL's (69%) had become hard and none
      had deteriorated, whilst in the control group, four PRCL's (4%)
      had become worse (p&lt;0.01). At the six-month recall, in the
      ozone group, seven PRCL's (8%) remained leathery, the remaining 82
      (92%) PRCL's had become hard, whilst in the control group, 10
      PRCL's had become worse (11%) and one had become hard (p&lt;0.01).
      At 12 and 18 months, 87 Subjects attended. In the ozone group at
      12 months, two PRCL's remained leathery, compared to 85 (98%) that
      had hardened, whilst in the control group 21 (24%) of the PRCL's
      had progressed from leathery to soft, i.e. became worse, 65 PRCL's
      (75%) were still leathery, and one remained hard (p&lt;0.01). At
      18 months, 87 (100%) of ozone-treated PRCL's had arrested, whilst
      in the control group, 32 lesions (37%) of the PRCL's had worsened
      from leathery to soft (p&lt;0.01), 54 (62%) PRCL's remained
      leathery and only one of the control PRCL's had reversed
      (p&lt;0.01).<br>
      <b><br>
        CONCLUSIONS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Leathery non-cavitated primary root caries can be arrested
      non-operatively with ozone and remineralising products. This
      treatment regime is an effective alternative to conventional
      "drilling and filling".<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>In the present study, we examined the effect of ozonated water
      on oral microorganisms and dental plaque. Almost no microorganisms
      were detected after being treated with ozonated water (4 mg/l) for
      10 s. To estimate the ozonated water-treated Streptococcus mutans,
      bacterial cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD BacLight Bacterial
      Viability Kit. Fluorescence microscopic analysis revealed that S.
      mutans cells were killed instantaneously in ozonated water. Some
      breakage of ozonated water-treated S. mutans was found by electron
      microscopy. When the experimental dental plaque was exposed to
      ozonated water, the number of viable S. mutans remarkably
      decreased. Ozonated water strongly inhibited the accumulation of
      experimental dental plaque in vitro. After the dental plaque
      samples from human subjects were exposed to ozonated water in
      vitro, almost no viable bacterial cells were detected. These
      results suggest that ozonated water should be useful in reducing
      the infections caused by oral microorganisms in dental plaque.<br>

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
      </b>Microorganisms remaining beneath restorations can cause
      secondary caries and pulp damage. Because of this, antimicrobial
      treatment could be useful. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the antibacterial effect of the HealOzone device on Streptococcus
      mutans and to compare it with the already proven activity of two
      dentin-bonding systems. Thirty-five human molars were divided into
      5 groups. Cavities were then cut into the teeth (n = 28 cavities
      per group). After sterilization, the teeth were left in broth
      cultures of 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) of S. mutans
      at 36 degrees C for 48 h. The appropriate treatment followed
      (group A, control; group B, Clearfil SE Bond; group C, Clearfil
      Protect Bond; group D, 40 s of treatment with ozone; and group E,
      80 s of treatment with ozone), and the cavities were then filled
      with composite resin. After 72 h, the restorations were removed,
      dentin chips were collected with an excavator, and the total
      number of microorganisms was determined. All treatments
      significantly reduced the number of S. mutans present compared
      with the control group. The antimicrobial effect of both bonding
      systems and treatment with 80 s of ozone was significantly higher
      than the 40 s ozone treatment. In conclusion, HealOzone and the
      bonding systems show striking antimicrobial effects against S.
      mutans.<br>

      </b>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of
      ozonated water in the elimination of Candida albicans,
      Enterococcus faecalis, and endotoxins from root canals.
      Twenty-four single-rooted human teeth were inoculated with C.
      albicans and E. faecalis, and 24 specimens were inoculated with
      Escherichia coli endotoxin. Ozonated water (experimental group) or
      physiologic solution (control group) was used as irrigant agent.
      Antimicrobial effectiveness was evaluated by the reduction of
      microbial counts. Lipopolissacharide complex presence was assessed
      by limulus amebocyte lysate test and B-lymphocyte stimulation.
      Data were analyzed by Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests (5%).
      Ozonated water significantly reduced the number of C. albicans and
      E. faecalis at the immediate sampling, but increased values were
      detected after 7 days. Ozonated water did not neutralize
      endotoxin. It could be concluded that ozonated water was effective
      against C. albicans and E. faecalis but showed no residual effect.
      No activity on endotoxin was observed.<br>

        OBJECTIVES:<br>
        <br>
      </b>To determine the disinfecting effect of ozonized oxygen (120
      seconds from the HealOzone generator, KaVo) on Enterococcus
      faecalis, representing bacteria that are difficult to eliminate in
      the root canals of human teeth, and to compare it with the

      <br>
      <b>METHOD AND MATERIALS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>The roots (n = 10 in each group) were sterilized, contaminated
      with the test microorganisms in a quantitative preparation, rinsed
      with the test solutions, and dried. The residual concentration of
      E faecalis was determined through another irrigation stage with
      the sodium chloride solution.<br>
      <b><br>
        RESULTS:<br>

        <br>
      </b>Ozone has been proposed as an alternative antiseptic agent in
      dentistry based on reports of its antimicrobial effects in both
      gaseous and aqueous forms. This study investigated whether gaseous
      ozone (4 x 10(6) microg m(-3)) and aqueous ozone (1.25-20 microg
      ml(-1)) exert any cytotoxic effects on human oral epithelial (BHY)
      cells and gingival fibroblast (HGF-1) cells compared with
      established antiseptics [chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX) 2%, 0.2%;
      sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 5.25%, 2.25%; hydrogen peroxide
      (H(2)O(2)) 3%], over a time of 1 min, and compared with the
      antibiotic, metronidazole, over 24 h. Cell counts, metabolic
      activity, Sp-1 binding, actin levels, and apoptosis were
      evaluated. Ozone gas was found to have toxic effects on both cell
      types. Essentially no cytotoxic signs were observed for aqueous
      ozone. CHX (2%, 0.2%) was highly toxic to BHY cells, and slightly
      (2%) and non-toxic (0.2%) to HGF-1 cells. NaOCl and H(2)O(2)
      resulted in markedly reduced cell viability (BHY, HGF-1), whereas
      metronidazole displayed mild toxicity only to BHY cells. Taken
      together, aqueous ozone revealed the highest level of
      biocompatibility of the tested antiseptics.<br>

      </b>The objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial

      <br>
      <b>STUDY DESIGN:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Eighty single-rooted teeth with straight canals were selected.
      After preparation and sterilization, the specimens were inoculated
      with 10 microL Enterococcus faecalis for 24 hours at 37 degrees C.
      The contaminated roots were divided into 2 experimental groups, 1
      negative control group, and 1 positive control group of 20 teeth
      each: Group 1, KTP laser group; Group 2, gaseous ozone group;
      Group 3, sodium hypochlorite group (NaOCl) (negative control); and
      Group 4, saline group (positive control). Sterile paper points
      used to sample bacteria from the root canals were transferred to
      tubes containing 5 mL of brain heart infusion broth. Then
      10-microL suspension was inoculated onto blood agar plates. The
      colonies of bacteria were counted and data were analyzed
      statistically using Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance and
      Mann-Whitney U tests.<br>
      <br>
      <b>RESULTS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>There were statistically significant differences between all

      remaining microorganisms. Complete sterilization was achieved in
      the 2.5% NaOCl group. The KTP laser and gaseous ozone did not
      completely sterilize the root canals.<br>

        CONCLUSION:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Both KTP laser and gaseous ozone have a significant
      antibacterial effect on infected root canals, with the gaseous
      ozone being more effective than the KTP laser. However, 2.5% NaOCl
      was superior in its antimicrobial abilities compared with KTP

        <br>
        INTRODUCTION:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Biofilms of resistant species such as Enterococcus faecalis
      pose a major challenge in the treatment of root canals with
      established periapical disease. This study examined the effects of
      gaseous ozone delivered into saline on biofilms of E. faecalis in
      root canals of extracted teeth with and without the use of passive
      ultrasonic agitation.<br>
      <b><br>
        METHODS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Biofilms of E. faecalis were established over 14 days in 70
      single roots that had undergone biomechanical preparation followed
      by gamma irradiation. The presence and purity of biofilms were
      confirmed using scanning electron microscopy and culture. Biofilms
      were treated with saline (negative control), 1% sodium
      hypochlorite for 120 seconds (positive control), ozone (140 ppm
      ozone in air at 2 L/min delivered into saline using a cannula for
      120 seconds), saline with passive ultrasonic activation (70 kHz
      and 200 mW/cm(2) applied to an ISO 15 file held passively within
      the canal, for 120 seconds), and ozone followed immediately by
      ultrasonic agitation. After treatment, samples were taken from the
      biofilm and serially diluted for plate counting.<br>
      <b><br>
        RESULTS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Analysis revealed that 1% sodium hypochlorite was the most
      effective disinfecting agent followed by ozone combined with
      ultrasonic agitation, ozone alone, and finally ultrasonic alone.<br>
      <b><br>
        CONCLUSIONS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Although none of the treatment regimes were able to reliably
      render canals sterile under the conditions used, ozone gas
      delivered into irrigating fluids in the root canal may be useful
      as an adjunct for endodontic disinfection.<br>

      <b><br>
        MATERIALS AND METHODS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Ten bovine enamel and dentin samples per group were pretreated
      as follows: (I) ozone application (Healozone, KaVo) for 60 s alone
      or (II) with subsequent application of a fluoride- and
      xylitol-containing antioxidant (liquid reductant), (III)
      light-activated bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min
      serving as negative control (Hi-Lite, Shofu), and (IV) untreated
      enamel and dentin (positive control). Specimens were bonded with a
      functional 3-step adhesive system (Syntac Classic, Ivoclar
      Vivadent) and restored with a composite (Tetric Ceram, Ivoclar
      Vivadent) according to the Ultradent method. After storage in
      water at 37 degrees C for 24 h, shear bond strength was measured
      using a Zwick universal testing machine. Data were analyzed using
      ANOVA and Scheffe's post hoc analysis.<br>
      <b><br>
        RESULTS:<br>
        <br>
      </b>In concordance with the existing literature, bleaching
      resulted in significantly decreased bond strength (p &lt; 0.05) on
      enamel specimens. No decrease in shear bond strength was detected
      for ozone-pretreated specimens compared to untreated controls.<br>
      <b><br>
        CONCLUSION:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Despite a possible retention of surface and subsurface
      oxide-related substances during high-dose ozone application, shear
      bond strength was not impaired. Thus, adhesive restoration
      placement should be possible immediately after ozone application
      for cavity disinfection.<br>

      </b>The shear bond strength test was conducted to assess adhesion
      on enamel (protocol 1), while the microtensile bond strength test
      was performed on dentin (protocol 2). Protocol 1: 96 bovine
      incisors were randomly divided into 4 groups, and enamel surfaces
      were bonded in accordance with the following treatments: (1E)
      ozone + Clearfil Protect Bond; (2E) Clearfil Protect Bond
      (control); (3E) ozone + Xeno III; (4E) Xeno III (control). Ozone
      gas was applied for 80 s. Shear bond strength was measured with a
      universal testing machine. Protocol 2: 40 noncarious human molars
      were selected. Middle/deep dentin was exposed and bonded in
      accordance with the following treatments: (1D) ozone+Clearfil
      Protect Bond; (2D) Clearfil Protect Bond (control); (3D)
      ozone+Xeno III (4D) Xeno III (control). Four-mm-thick buildups

        <br>
      </b>No statistical differences were found between ozone treated

        Abstract<br>
        <br>
        OBJECTIVE:<br>
        <br>
      </b>This study investigated the effect of ozone pretreatment on
      the microleakage and marginal integrity of pit and fissure
      sealants placed with or without a self-etch 6th generation
      adhesive.<br>
      <b><br>
        STUDY DESIGN:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Freshly-extracted, human third molars were randomly assigned
      into two main groups (n = 48): Group A: Fissures were pretreated
      with ozone; Group B: Fissures were left untreated. The teeth were
      further randomly divided into two subgroups (n = 24/each) so that
      half of teeth were sealed with a conventional fissure sealant
      (Fissurit F, Voco, Germany), while the remaining half received the
      same sealant bonded with a self-etch adhesive (Clearfil Protect
      Bond, Kuraray, Japan). Following thermal cycling (1000X), the
      specimens were subjected to dye penetration within 0.5% basic
      fuchsin for 24h. The extent of dye penetration was measured by
      image analysis. Kruskal Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used
      for statistical analysis of the data (p = 0.05). Two
      randomly-selected sections from each group were observed under SEM
      RESULTS: In all groups, ozone pretreatment significantly reduced
      the extent of microleakage (p &lt; 0.001). SEM investigation
      demonstrated better adaptation of the sealants in ozone-pretreated
      groups. Clearfil Protect Bond did not improve the marginal seal of
      Fissurit F (p &gt; 0.05).<br>
      <b><br>
        CONCLUSION:<br>
        <br>
      </b>Ozone pretreatment favorably affected the marginal sealing
      ability of the tested fissure sealants.<br>
