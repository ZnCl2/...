      <br>
      A team of Taiwanese researchers has combined industrial waste
      water and petroleum oil to make a new fuel that could largely
      eliminate the costly treatment of industrial air emissions from
      boilers, is an environmentally-friendly way to treat industrial
      wastewater, and could increase fuel efficiency by 14%.<br>
      <br>
      Worldwide, many industrial processes depend on steam boilers that
      are powered by what’s called heavy fuel oil (HFO). In the US,
      where coal and natural gas are plentiful, boilers are not
      typically run on HFO, but many homes in the Northeast US are still
      heated with furnaces that use HFO. These boilers are notorious for
      spewing out toxins into the environment when untreated.<br>
      <br>
      Current laws require industrial boilers to be fitted with air
      pollution control devices that treat the emissions so they satisfy
      air quality regulations. At the same time, many of these
      industries produce a lot of wastewater that needs to be treated as
      well. All of this treatment adds up to a hefty bill, which, some
      would argue, stifles innovation and holds the economy back.<br>
      <br>
      So what if we could kill two birds with one stone? What if the
      same wastewater coming out of these factories could be mixed with
      standard HFO to make a new type of fuel that burns much cleaner?
      We’d be satisfying the needs of our environment with the needs of
      industry for a beautiful win-win solution — exactly what the world
      needs more of.<br>
      <br>
      A research team at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan has
      set about to make this fantasy a reality. They’ve discovered that
      when they mix 80% HFO with 19.9% wastewater and 0.1% surfactant,
      then burn it in a boiler, carbon monoxide emissions are reduced by
      84% compared to the emissions generated by burning standard heavy
      petroleum oil in the same boiler. Not only that, the new fuel also
      drastically reduces other emissions such as particulate matter,
      nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organics.<br>
      <br>
      The addition of the wastewater to the oil causes microexplosions
      prior to ignition of the oil which, in turn, causes the oil to
      atomize into a fine vapor. This increases the surface area of the
      oil and leads to more complete combustion. The water also lowers
      the temperature of combustion of the entire mixture which also
      reduces pollution from nitrogen oxides.<br>
      <br>
      Although the team has only focused on boiler applications to this
      point (understandably; there are about 6000 industrial boilers in
      Taiwan alone using 12 billion liters of HFO annually), there is no
      reason this type of fuel couldn’t be used in a standard diesel
      engine with a bit of modification.<br>

      <b>Synopsis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The extent of pollution reduction in boiler flue gas, as well as
      enhanced energy saving, by using wastewater-emulsified oil fuel is
      investigated. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The limited data for using emulsified oil have demonstrated its
      effectiveness in reducing flue gas pollutant emissions. The
      presence of a high concentration of toxic organic compounds in
      industrial wastewaters always presents significant problems.
      Therefore, this study was undertaken by using wastewater with COD
      of 9600 mg/L and total petroleum hydrocarbons-gasoline 440 mg/L
      for making an emulsified oil (wastewater content 20% with 0.1%
      surfactant) to evaluate the extent of reductions in both criteria
      pollutants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For comparison,
      two other systems (heavy oil fuel and water-emulsified oil) were
      also conducted. The wastewater-emulsified oil fuel results in
      significant reductions in particulate matter (PM), NOx, SO2, and
      CO as compared to heavy oil fuel and similar to those from
      water/oil emulsified fuel; for PM, it is better in
      wastewater-emulsified oil. The reductions of total PAH flue gas
      emissions are 38 and 30% for wastewater- and water-emulsified
      fuel, respectively; they are 63 and 44% for total BaPeq,
      respectively. In addition to reducing flue gas pollutant
      emissions, the results also demonstrate that the use of
      wastewater-emulsified fuel in boiler operation provides several
      advantages: (1) safe disposal of industrial wastewater; and (2)
      energy savings of about 13%. Thus, wastewater/oil-emulsified fuel
      is highly suitable for use in boilers.<br>

          <b>US2009151231</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a method for producing emulsified
      fuels by using oily water, including the following steps: (I)
      adequately mixing oily water formed by dissolving about 0.02-30%
      w/w of flammable fuels into water with about 0.01-3% w/w of an
      emulsifier; (II) then preliminarily mixing with about 60-95% w/w
      of traditional heavy oils or about 75-98% w/w of traditional
      diesel; and (III) further mixing and emulsifying the whole so as
      to produce oily water added emulsified heavy oil (abbreviated as
      OWEH) or oily water added emulsified diesel (abbreviated as OWED).
      The oily water can be specifically produced based on the foregoing
      concentration ratio, and can directly use oily industrial
      wastewater, or can use oily industrial wastewater after simple
      removal of solid impurities. If the oil contents of the oily
      industrial wastewater is insufficient, the oil water with proper
      concentration may be produced for use through a concentration
      process. The adopted emulsifier can be an emulsifier that is
      general and commercialized and facilitates mixing oil with water
      uniformly. When the oily water added emulsified heavy oils (
      abbreviated as OWEH) or the oily water added emulsified diesel
      (abbreviated as OWED) produced by the production method of this
      invention are respectively used in a heavy oil boiler and an
      diesel engine, the combustion efficiency can be significantly
      improved and air pollutant emission can be reduced, and at the
      same time the effect of energy saving can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0001] 1. Field of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The invention relates to a process for manufacturing
      emulsified fuels by using “oily water”, that is proceeded by
      following steps: (1) preparing the “oily water” that has 0.02 ~30%
      (w/w) of combustible fuels dissolved in water and is blended with
      surfactants (or called as emulsifiers) by 0.01 ~3% (w/w); (2)
      primarily mixing the emulsified “oily water” with surfactants,
      that was finished by step (1), with 60 ~95% (w/w) of heavy fuel
      oil (abbreviation as heavy oil) or with 75 ~98% (w/w) of diesel,
      respectively; and (3) keeping the mixtures that were finished by
      step (2), respectively, and mixed up further by using homogenizer
      to become an “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH) or an “oily
      water emulsified diesel” (OWED). The OWEH and the OWED can be
      utilized for industrial boilers and diesel engines, respectively,
      not only elevates combustion efficiency and lower pollutant
      emission, but also save energy and reduce cost.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003] 2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Commonly, the traditional heavy fuel oil (abbreviation as
      heavy oil) or diesel have defects of inferior atomization,
      inhomogeneous mixing of air and fuel. Therefore, in the combustion
      furnace, a high fuel concentration spot occurred and fuel was
      thermally decomposed in the oxygen lean condition to cause
      incomplete combustion and to produce a great amount of unburned
      carbon particulates and black smoke in the stack flue gases. In
      this way, the incomplete combustion not only induced environmental
      pollutions, but also increased fuel consumption. Therefore,
      emulsified fuels such as emulsified heavy oil and emulsified
      diesel have been commercially provided. Comparatively, in the
      combustion of the emulsified fuels, syngases of water/fuel may
      take place by means of micro-explosion to keep coarse droplets of
      the emulsified fuels cracked into smaller ones, able to apparently
      upgrade atomization to promote combustion efficiency. Moreover,
      the explosion of the fuel droplets can enhance perfect turbulence
      in the combustion chamber to further raise combustion efficiency,
      to lower fuel consumption, and to oxidize the carbon particulates
      produced by incomplete combustion. That can effectively prohibit
      the black smoke in the stack flue gases, accordingly boosting
      environmental protection. The conventional processes of emulsified
      fuels known so far are always based on water (clean groundwater or
      city tap water) mixing with surfactants and heavy oil (or diesel),
      which are directly blended together in a certain ratio to become a
      “water-in-oil emulsified fuel”: a so-called water emulsified heavy
      oil (WEH) or water emulsified diesel (WED). However, such a
      water-in-oil emulsified fuel not only can not achieve a stable
      emulsification condition, result in the separation of water and
      oil, but also do not display a significant energy saving fraction
      to afford a high expanse for the costs of emulsification process
      such as surfactants, hardware and labor costs. Therefore, the
      emulsified fuels were not popularly commercialized in the past
      twenty years.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In this invention, during this study of trying to overcome
      the defects of the conventional “water-in-oil emulsified fuels” —
      water emulsified heavy oil (WEH) or water emulsified diesel (WED),
      the oily industrial waste water has been simultaneously studied.
      It has been found that conventional treatment of the oily
      industrial waste water is rather uneconomic. So, an idea of
      recycling the oily industrial waste water came up then. More
      minutely, there are several problems found in conventional
      treatment of oily industrial waste water such as a high
      concentration of oil in water which was not easily bio-degradable,
      a high wastewater treatment cost, a low removal efficiency and
      always a result in secondary pollutions. Although the oily
      industrial waste water can be treated more effectively by liquid
      injected incineration, but a soaring cost of auxiliary fuel makes
      it impractical. Thus, inspired by the concept—“Treating it, why
      not recycling it”, the invention has at length been devised to
      improve the defects of the conventional water emulsified fuels by
      making use of oily industrial waste water.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] For need of study, the inventor has deeply realized the
      relative prior arts and summarized their conclusions as mentioned
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] (1) Emulsified diesel can promote combustion efficiency of
      diesel engines and lower emission of NO, THC and PM without
      obvious increase of fuel consumption (Samec et al., 2002, see item
      1 in Appendix 1; Armas et al., 2005, see item 2 in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] (2) Emulsified diesel can lower heat flux, heat load and
      crank abrasion of a diesel engine (Sii et al., 1995, see item 3 in
      Appendix 1; Selim and Elfeky, 2001, see item 4 in Appendix 1).
      And, as water content is increased, the diesel engine is to
      enhance its torsion, power and thermal efficiency, but the
      temperature of the exhausted gas drops down instead (Abu-Zaid,
      2004, see item 5 in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] (3) Emulsified fuel made from rapeseed and slurry of C.
      vulgaris can reduce emission of NOx, but increase CO emission and
      fuel consumption (Scragg et al., 2003, see item 6 in Appendix 1).
      On the contrary, if an oxygenated diglymeu is added to emulsified
      fuels, NOx emission and combustion efficiency are to be increased,
      but fuel consumption rate, specific fuel consumption, smoke and CO
      emission are to drop down (Lin and Wang, 2004, see item 7 in
      Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] (4) Emulsified diesel added with an oxygenated agent is to
      elevate its activity and stability (Lin and Wang, 2003, see item 8
      in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0011] (5) Emulsified fuels added with linear-structure oxygenated
      agents can reduce PM emission more effectively than those added
      with ring-structure oxygenated agent can. In addition, owing to
      the increase of atomic oxygen, the emulsified fuels are to have a
      higher combustion temperature, enhancing an increase of NOx
      formation (Song et al., 2004, see item 9 in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0012] (6) In investigating the flame via burning cumene with a
      high air ratio, it is found NOx emission is lowered because fu e I
      lam i n a r is burned around recycled area under a relative
      temperature, owing to the outer circumference of fuel diluted with
      an excess of air before ignition (Takagi et al., 1981, see item 10
      in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] (7) With intake air enrichment, NOx emission is to increase
      as the size of fuel droplet is increased, but to lower in case of
      carrying out a staged combustion (England et al., 1980, see item
      11 in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] (8) Baltaser found that NOx emission is to reduce with an
      increase of high pollution reflux, possible to affect the whole
      flame stability, combustion efficiency, and emission of CO and
      hydrocarbons burned incompletely (Baltaser et al., 1997, see item
      12 in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0015] (9) Chung found that HLB are 5.5 and 13.7 for the most
      stable W/O and O/W respectively. Usually, after emulsified fuel
      droplet is vibrated by supersonic, the size of water droplet
      changes significantly inside oil, examined under electron
      microscope. For lighter fuels, such as octane, no matter if it is
      W/O or O/W, the phase having a small size is to evaporate swiftly.
      As for heavier fuels, such as cetane, diesel or heavy oil, they
      are apt to make microburst. But, if water is blended homogeneously
      with fuel in extremely minor droplets, so as to perform a
      water-in-oil emulsification, the water droplets are not to retard
      combustion at all, and instead, are effective to diminish carbon
      smoke and incomplete combustion for saving energy (Chung, 1990,
      see item 13 in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0016] (10) Shu, Y. C. reveals that base heavy oil or wasted oil
      added with water can lower its thermal effect because oil is
      partially replaced by water that is to absorb the heat produced by
      oil combustion. The boiler temperature is determined by a
      comparison between the effect of microburst and the heat loss
      after adding water in oil. An optimal addition of water can
      achieve effective microburst to raise combustion efficiency for
      compensating heat loss absorbed by water. If a large quantity of
      water is added, even though effective microburst happens, they are
      not effective enough to compensate the heat loss. In pollution
      treatments, there are two main factors that pose a reduction of
      NOx formation for burning oil added with water. First, the
      temperature is lowered by water to reduce thermal NO formation.
      Second, water is added to render a reduction of nitrogen content
      in oil, so that NOx formation is lowered. But, it noted that water
      fraction must be reached to a certain level (approx. 10%) to lower
      NOx formation, otherwise, NOx formation is to be increased,
      possible to increase partial high temperature caused by micro
      bursts and to further enhance thermal NO formation. As for SOx, it
      is clearly found SOx formation is reduced in the combustion of
      base oil or wasted oil added with water, because of the addition
      of water diluting total sulfur contained in oil (Shu, Y. C. 2003,
      see item 14 in Appendix 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] According to the patent bulletin of Patent Office of
      Taiwan, R. O. C., it reveals that six patents are involved in
      reduction of pollution emission via using emulsified diesel and
      emulsified heavy oil, abbreviated as follows.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0024] The invention has been devised to improve the defects of
      the conventional water-in-oil emulsified fuels, such as water
      emulsified heavy oil (WEH) and water emulsified diesel (WED), as
      mentioned previously.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] The objective of this invention is to offer a process for
      manufacturing emulsified fuels by using “oily water”, not only
      easily prepared with a low cost, but also able to elevate
      combustion efficiency, to lower pollutant emission, and to save
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] For heavy fuel oil, the process for manufacturing
      emulsified fuels by using “oily water” in the invention includes
      the following steps: (1) preparing the “oily water” that has 0.02
      ~30% (w/w) of combustible fuel dissolved in water and is blended
      with surfactants (or called as emulsifiers) by 0.01 ~3% (w/w); (2)
      primarily mixing a mixture of the “oily water” with surfactants,
      that was finished in step (1), with 60 ~95% (w/w) of conventional
      heavy fuel oil; and, (3) having a mixture of step (2) mixed up
      further by using homogenizer to become an “oily water emulsified
      heavy oil”.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] For diesel, the process for manufacturing emulsified fuels
      by using “oily water” in the invention includes the following
      steps: (1) preparing the “oily water” that has 0.02 ~30% (w/w) of
      combustible fuel dissolved in water and is blended with
      surfactants (or called as emulsifiers) by 0.01 ~3% (w/w); (2)
      primarily mixing a mixture of the “oily water” with surfactants,
      that was finished in step (1), with 75 ~98% (w/w) of conventional
      diesel; and, (3) having a mixture of step (2) mixed up further by
      using homogenizer to become an “oily water emulsified diesel”.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The “oily water” can be prepared purposely by the specified
      concentration mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The “oily water” can be directly selected from oily
      industrial waste water.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The “oily water” can be selected from oily industrial waste
      water that has been filtered to get rid of solid impurities.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The “oily water” can be selected from oily industrial waste
      water that is concentrated to a proper concentration in case of
      having a lower original concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The surfactants (or so called as emulsifiers) can be any of
      commercial ones as long as it is capable of keeping oil and water
      homogeneously mixed.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The “oily water” is “water containing dissolved fuel”.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The “dissolved fuel” is a mixture of at least one, two
      mixed or three or more mixed compound selected from the group
      consisting of combustible alcohols (including substituted groups
      such as bio-alcohols and glycerin), alkanes (including substituted
      groups), benzens (including substituted groups), ethers (including
      substituted groups), aldehydes (including substituted groups),
      ketones (including substituted groups), organic acids (including
      substituted groups), esters (including substituted groups),
      mineral oils (including cutting oils), lubricating oils, gasoline,
      diesel (including biodiesel, vegetable oils and animal oils used
      for producing biodiesel), and heavy oils (including fuel oils,
      residue oil or circulation oil).<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0037] As shown in FIG. 1, a preferred embodiment of a process for
      manufacturing emulsified fuels by using “oily water” in the
      present invention is processed with the following steps: (a)
      preparing the “oily water” that has 0.02 ~30% (w/w) of combustible
      fuel dissolved in water and blended with surfactants (or called as
      emulsifiers) by 0.01 ~3% (w/w); (b) mixing the “oily water” an d
      the surfactants t h at was finished by step (a) with 60 ~95% (w/w)
      of conventional heavy fuel oil or with 75 ~98% (w/w) of
      conventional diesel, respectively; (c) mixing the two mixtures,
      respectively, that was finished by step (b) further by using
      homogenizer to become an “oily water emulsified heavy oil”,
      denoted as OWEH, and an “oily water emulsified diesel”, denoted as
      OWED, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As the “oily water” is a necessary raw material in the
      present invention, it therefore must be obtained before proceeding
      with any further manufacturing step. The “oily water” is gained
      via plural ways: (1) adding 0.0 ~30% (w/w) of combustible fuel in
      to water to form the “oily water” used as an additive in the
      present invention; (2) directly making use of oily industrial
      waste water containing 0.02?30% (w/w) of combustible fuel as the
      “oily water” or filter the oily industrial waste water in advance
      by a simple filtration means if there are solid impurities
      existing in the industrial waste water; (3) concentrating the oily
      industrial waste water to the range 0.02 ~30% (w/w) needed for the
      “oily water” of the invention in case of too low oil concentration
      in water. It is should be noted the “oily water” cannot contain
      too high concentration of corrosive species such as fluorine,
      chlorine, or bromine.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] No matter how the “oily water” having 0.02 ~30% (w/w) of
      combustible fuel is obtained, it can be used as the additive of
      the invention. The “oily water” is further defined as “water
      containing dissolved fuel”, wherein the “dissolved fuel” can be a
      mixture of at least one compound selected from the group
      consisting of combustible alcohols (including substituted groups
      such as bio-alcohols and glycerin), alkanes (including substituted
      groups), benzens (including substituted groups), ethers (including
      substituted groups), aldehydes (including substituted groups),
      ketones (including substituted groups), organic acids (including
      substituted groups), esters (including substituted groups),
      mineral oils (including cutting oils), lubricating oils, gasoline,
      diesel (including biodiesel, vegetable oils and animal oils used
      for producing biodiesel), and heavy oils (including fuel oils,
      residue oil or circulation oil). In the embodiment, the
      combustible “dissolved fuel” (or their mixture) are first
      dissolved homogeneously in water to become the “oily water” that
      is consecutively added and homogeneously blended with surfactants
      (or so called as emulsifiers). Then, conventional heavy oil or
      conventional diesel is added in by a designated concentration,
      mixed up to get well emulsified to become the “oily water
      emulsified heavy” (briefed as OWEH) or the “oily water emulsified
      diesel” (briefed as OWED).<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (briefed as OWEH) has
      been practically tested to show a better stability than
      conventional water emulsified heavy oils; in a heavy oil boiler
      test, the particulate matter (PM), the total polycyclic aromatic
      hydrocarbons (PAHs), the total toxicity equivalent concentration
      (Total-BaPeq), the carbon monoxide (CO) and the nitrogen oxides
      (NOx) contained in stack flue gases are obviously lowered and are
      greatly saving the energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] As for the “oily water emulsified diesel” (briefed as OWED)
      tested in a diesel engine, it also well achieved a reduction of
      pollutant emission and save energy. Therefore, the “oily water
      emulsified fuels” produced by the present invention can really
      raise combustion efficiency, lower the pollutant emission, and
      save energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] First of all, the terms expressed in the experiments
      related with heavy oil and diesel is to be clarified in the
      following description. Traditional heavy oil (EH-0) represents
      that it contains complete traditional heavy oil added with 0% of
      tap water or “oily water”. Water emulsified heavy oil (WEH-20)
      represents that it contains 20% of tap water and 80% of
      traditional heavy oil. “Oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20)
      represents that it contains 20% of the “oily water” and 80% of
      traditional heavy oil. Traditional diesel (ED-0) represents that
      it contains a complete traditional diesel added with 0% of tap
      water or “oily water”. Water emulsified diesel (WED-13) represents
      that it contains 13% of water and 87% of traditional diesel. “Oily
      water emulsified diesel with “oily water” (OWED-13) represents
      that it contains 13% of the “oily water” and 87% of traditional
      diesel.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In heavy oil experiments, the traditional heavy oil used in
      the invention is No. 6 heavy oil purchased from a petroleum
      company in Taiwan, conforming to the specifications of fuel oils
      for industrial boilers. The “oily water” is supplied by a waste
      oil recycling factory located in southern Taiwan. Usually, in
      order to reduce water content in recycled waste oils, it is
      stripped off by thermal vacuum treatment. The industrial waste
      water is treated to keep oils and water separated, with the upper
      oil layer recycled for being used as fuel and with the lower layer
      of “oily water” used in the experiments of the invention. As shown
      in Appendix 2, the “oily water” has been analyzed to have the
      following data: chemical oxygen demand (COD) being 9600 mg/L,
      total petroleum hydrocarbon as gasoline (TPH-gasoline) being 444
      mg/L, total petroleum hydrocarbon as diesel (TPH-diesel) being 97
      mg/L. The “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) is
      formulated by first blending 0.5% surfactants (or so called as
      emulsifier s) in “oily water” and then obtained (OWEH-20) by
      adding 20% (W/W) of the “oily water with surfactants” in 80% of
      traditional heavy oil (EH-0). As for the “water emulsified heavy
      oil” (WEH-20), it is formulated by first blending surfactants (or
      so called as emulsifiers) in 20% (W/W) of tap water (regularly
      used in southern Taiwan) that is then sufficiently mixed with 80%
      (W/W) of traditional heavy oil (EH-0).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] According to experiments of a heavy oil boiler, the average
      emission factors of particulate matter (PM) obtained when the
      boiler creates one kJ of steam heat are 4.3, 3.7 and 2.7 mg/kJ
      steam for the traditional heavy oil (EH-0), the emulsified heavy
      oil (WEH-20) and the “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20)
      respectively. If the traditional heavy oil (EH-0) is regarded as a
      basis with a percentage of 100%, the average emission factors of
      particulate matter (PM) for the water emulsified heavy oil
      (WEH-20) and the “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) are
      comparatively reduced by 20.9% and 37.2% respectively; and, 16.3%
      of the average emission factors of particulate matter (PM) is
      reduced if comparing the “oily water emulsified heavy oil”
      (OWEH-20) with the water emulsified heavy oil (WEH-20).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In terms of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
      it has been found that the average emission factors of total
      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) generated while producing
      one kJ steam by boiler are respectively 2.83, 2.10 and 1.82
      µg/kJ-steam for the traditional heavy oil (EH-0), the water
      emulsified heavy oil (WEH-20) and the “oily water emulsified heavy
      oil” (OWEH-20). If the traditional heavy oil (EH-0) is regarded as
      a basis with a percentage of 100%, the emission factors of total
      polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for the water emulsified
      heavy oil (WEH-20) and the “oily water emulsified heavy oil”
      (OWEH-20) are comparatively reduced by 25.8% and 35.7%
      respectively; and, 9.9% of the emission factor of total polycyclic
      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) i s decreased if comparing the “oily
      water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) with the “water emulsified
      heavy oil” (WEH-20). By comparing total toxicity equivalent
      concentration (Total-BaPeq), it has been found that the average
      emission factors of total toxicity equivalent concentration
      (Total-BaPeq) generated while producing one kJ steam by boiler are
      respectively 29.5, 17.8 and 15.6 ng/kJ-steam for the traditional
      heavy oil (EH-0), the water emulsified heavy oil (WEH-20) and the
      “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20). If the traditional
      heavy oil (EH-0) is regarded as a basis with a percentage of 100%,
      the emission factor of totla toxicity concentration (Total-BaPeq)
      for the water emulsified heavy oil (WEH-20) and the “oily water
      emulsified heavy” (OWEH-20) are comparatively reduced by 39.7% and
      47.1% respectively; and, 7.4% of the emission factor of total
      toxicity concentration (Total-BaPeq) is lowered if comparing the
      “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) with the “water
      emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20).<br>
      <br>
      [0046] As for the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), its
      average concentrations are respectively 171, 35.0 and 27.0 ppmv
      for the traditional heavy oil (EH-0), the water emulsified heavy
      oil (WEH-20) and the “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20).
      If the traditional heavy oil (EH-0) is regarded as a basis with a
      percentage of 100%, the average concentration of carbon monoxide
      (CO) for the water emulsified heavy oil (WEH-20) and the “oily
      water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) are comparatively lowered by
      79.5% and 84.2% respectively; and, it is lowered by 4.7% if
      comparing the “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) with the
      “water emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20). With regard to the
      concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx), its average concentrations
      are respectively 198, 178 and 168 ppmv for the traditional heavy
      oil (EH-0), the “water emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20) and the
      “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20). If the traditional
      heavy oil (EH-0) is regarded as a basis with a percentage of 100%,
      the average concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) for the “water
      emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20) and the “oily water emulsified
      heavy oil” (OWEH-20) are comparatively lowered by 10.1% and 15.2%
      respectively; and, it is lowered by 5.1 % if comparing the “oily
      water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) with the “water emulsified
      heavy oil” (WEH-20).<br>
      <br>
      [0047] As the data shown in Appendix 3, the “oily water emulsified
      heavy oil” (OWEH-20) is more stable than the “water emulsified
      heavy oil” (WEH-20).<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Viewing from energy efficiency of a boiler, it has been
      found that the average energy efficiency of the traditional heavy
      oil (EH-0), the “water emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20) and the
      “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) are respectively 43%,
      47% and 49%. That is, if the consumption of the traditional heavy
      oil (EH-0) is regarded as a basis with a percentage of 100% while
      generating a certain amount of steam by boiler, the average
      consumption of energy by the “water emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20)
      and by the “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) are
      comparatively lowered by 9.3% and 14% respectively; and, it is
      lowered by 4.7% if comparing the “oily water emulsified heavy oil”
      (OWEH-20) with the “water emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20). It
      should be noted that the “oily water” used in the experiments of
      the invention contains about 1% (W/W) of dissolved combustible
      fuel. So, the “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) contains
      about 0.2% (W/W) of fuel more than the “water emulsified heavy
      oil” (WEH-20) does. However, as revealed above, the “oily water
      emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) can save fuel energy as much as
      4.7% if compared to the “water emulsified heavy oil” (WEH-20). In
      other words, by consuming 0.2% (W/W) of more fuel to obtain 4.7%
      of more energy, a 23.5 times of energy is converted by per unit
      mass of the extra 0.2% fuel. According to the UN standard
      estimation, the “oily water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH-20) can
      have a reduction of carbon dioxide emission approximately by 14%,
      in comparison to traditional heavy oil combusted to generate a
      certain amount of steam.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In diesel experiments, the traditional diesel used in the
      invention is premium diesel manufactured by a petroleum company in
      Taiwan, conforming to the Taiwan diesel specifications for a
      diesel engine. The “oily water” for the production of “oily water
      emulsified diesel” (OWED-13) is obtained by homogeneously mixing
      1% (W/W) of palm biodiesel in city tape water. Next, the “oily
      water” is sufficiently blended with 0.1% (W/W) of surfactants (or
      so called as emulsifiers). Then, 13% (W/W) of the emulsified “oily
      water” is completely mixed with 87% (W/W) of traditional diesel to
      become the “oily water emulsified diesel” (OWED-13).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] According to the tests of diesel engine, it has been found
      that the specific fuel consumption are respectively 0.356, 0.393
      and 0.379 L/kW·h for the traditional diesel (ED-0), the water
      emulsified diesel (WED-13) and the “oily water emulsified diesel”
      (OWED-13). Compared to the traditional diesel (ED-0), the ratios
      of conventional diesel plus bio-diesel contained in the water
      emulsified diesel (WED-13) and the “oily water emulsified diesel”
      (OWED-13) are respectively 87% and 87.13%, and the average ratios
      of energy saved are 4.0% and 6.3% for the water emulsified diesel
      (WED-13) and the “oily water emulsified diesel” (OWED-13)
      respectively. It also shows that 2.3% of energy is saved by the
      “oily water emulsified diesel” (OWED-13) if compared to the water
      emulsified diesel (WED-13).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] As the “oily water” used in the experiments of the
      invention contains about 1% (W/W) of dissolved combustible fuel,
      the “oily water emulsified diesel” (OWED-13) therefore contains
      about 0.13% (W/W) of fuel more than the water emulsified diesel
      (WED-13) does. So, by consuming 0.13% (W/W) of more fuel to obtain
      2.3% of more energy, 17.7 times of the energy is converted by per
      unit mass of the extra 0.13% fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] As for experiments of a diesel generator, it has been found
      that the average emission factors of particulate matter (PM)
      obtained while generating one kW·h of energy are 92.5, 58.8 and
      55.6 mg/kW·h for the traditional diesel (ED-0), the water
      emulsified diesel (WED-13) and the “oily water emulsified diesel”
      (OWED-13) respectively. If the traditional diesel (ED-0) is
      regarded as a basis with a percentage of 100%, the average
      emission factors of particulate matter (PM) for the water
      emulsified diesel (WED-13) and the “oily water emulsified diesel”
      (OWED-13) are comparatively reduced by 36.4% and 39.9%
      respectively; and, 3.5% of the average emission factors of
      particulate matter (PM) is lowered if comparing the “oily water
      emulsified diesel” (OWED-13) with the “water emulsified diesel”
      (WED-13).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] As shown previously in the experimental data, the present
      invention is a brand-new one with a great breakthrough. The “oily
      water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH) and the “oily water emulsified
      diesel” (OWED) respectively utilized for boilers and diesel
      engines, respectively, can enhance the combustion efficiencies in
      the combustion chambers and reduce the pollutant emissions, not
      only saving energy but also achieving the purpose of green
      environmental protection. Moreover, for the heavy oil boiler and
      the diesel engine, how to save energy and how to reduce the
      pollutant emissions are always concerned by people. The “oily
      water emulsified heavy oil” (OWEH) and the “oily water emulsified
      diesel” (OWED) manufactured in the invention can definitely
      promise to solve the problems mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As described previously, the invention provides a brand-new
      method to improve the defects of conventional emulsified fuels.
      The essential point is dissolving partial fuel in water in advance
      to become the “oily water”, which is consecutively blended with
      surfactants (or so called as emulsifiers). Next, the “oily water
      with surfactants” is mixed up with heavy oil or diesel,
      respectively, to become an “oily water emulsified heavy oil”
      (OWEH) or an “oily water emulsified diesel” (OWED), which are so
      stable that fuel is not easy to be separated from water, allowing
      a lower addition of surfactants (emulsifiers) to save the cost.
      Moreover, as the “oily water” in the OWEH or the OWED is in a
      status of having plenty of fuel droplets homogeneously surrounded
      by water and the water also being dissolved by fuels, the fuel
      droplets in water become numerous ignition points while burning,
      so that incomplete combustion, caused by conventional emulsified
      fuels because of uneven size of water drops and sudden cooling of
      water, can be prevented from happening. Thus, combusted with the
      OWEH and the OWED of the invention, it can not only boost
      combustion efficiency to greatly save energy, but also lower
      emission of pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] And, with the concept of “Recycling &amp; reusing oily
      industrial waste water”, the “oily water” used in the invention
      can be selected from the oily industrial waste water that has been
      simply filtered to get rid of solid impurities or has been raised
      in its concentration. Therefore, the oily industrial waste water
      can be easily re-used by the invention, instead of expending large
      sum in treating it, not only achieving the purpose of saving
      energy but also solving a tough problem of treating the oily
      industrial waste water.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] According to the prior arts and patents disclosed,
      improving fuels, equipment, boilers and air pollution control
      devices are mostly utilized to reduce pollutants, unlike the way
      done by the invention, making use of the oily industrial waste
      water as the “oily water” to blend with heavy oil or diesel,
      respectively, to become the “oily water emulsified heavy oil”
      (OWEH) or the “oily water emulsified diesel” (OWED). So, the
      invention is really a brand-new one.<br>
