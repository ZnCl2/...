      <br>
      [0001] Technical field<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates to a method for preparing and
      refining hydroxychloroquine and a preparation method thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003] Background technique</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, its chemical name is
      2-[[4-[(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)amino]pentyl]ethylamino]-ethanol
      sulfate, CAS No. 747-36- 40. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was
      successfully developed by Winthrop and first listed in the United
      States in 1956. It has been listed in France, Denmark, Japan,
      Germany, Finland and other countries and regions. On May 29, 1998,
      the US FDA approved hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the
      treatment of lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] US 2,546,658 discloses a process for the synthesis of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the process of which is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      [0007] 4,7-Dichloroquinoline is reacted with
      5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylenediylamino)-2-pentylamine
      (hereinafter referred to as hydroxychloroquine side chain
      compound) to give hydroxychloroquine, which is then sulfated to
      form a salt. The patent was reported in 1951, the process is
      older, the use of equivalent phenol as a solvent, increasing the
      difficulty of post-processing. Phenol is toxic and corrosive. Its
      concentrated solution is strongly corrosive to the skin. After
      treatment, it is converted into sodium phenol wastewater. The
      phenol-containing wastewater is a kind of hazardous and difficult
      to treat in industrial wastewater. It is the key control in China.
      One of the wastewaters has a large environmental pollution, which
      causes pressure on the treatment of the three wastes; the melting
      point of phenol is 42 ° C, which is solid at normal temperature.
      To be successfully fed, it must be heated and dissolved into
      liquid to be charged, and the operation is very cumbersome. The
      method is complicated and unsuitable for industrialization, and
      the yield of the crude hydroxychloroquine obtained is less than
      20%.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] CA2561987 discloses a process for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine. Since the reaction is maintained at 120-130 °
      C for a reaction time of 20-24 h, the impurity content in the
      crude product is high and the purification process is very
      complicated. In particular, in the post-treatment, in order to
      remove the deethylhydroxy chloroquine impurity
      (7-chloro-4-(4-N-hydroxyethyl-1-methyl-tertiary amino group) as
      shown in Formula I, a complicated post-treatment process is
      carried out: An amide group forming agent (for example, an acid
      anhydride) is reacted with an impurity of the formula I to form a
      compound of the formula II; and an appropriate amount of a base is
      added to hydrolyze a compound of the formula III; and under the
      same conditions of salt formation using hydroxychloroquine, the
      compound III cannot The salt is formed to remove impurities. In
      this method, the purification process of hydroxychloroquine and
      its sulfate is very complicated, the reaction time of the whole
      route is particularly long, and a large amount of waste water is
      generated, and complicated post-treatment is performed in order to
      remove impurities in the post-treatment. The process is costly and
      is not conducive to industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] W02010027150 also discloses a method for synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which comprises reacting two raw
      materials, after being pressurized with nitrogen or argon to a
      pressure of 5-20 bar, stirring at 80 ° C for 30 min, and heating
      to 100-120 ° C for reaction 4- 6h. After the reaction is
      completed, the hydroxychloroquine is acidified by adding dilute
      hydrochloric acid and chloroform. At this time, the
      hydroxychloroquine hydrochloride is dissolved in the aqueous
      phase, the aqueous phase is collected, alkalized with sodium
      hydroxide, hydroxychloroquine is extracted with chloroform, and
      the chloroform layer is concentrated and then dichlorocide is
      used. The hydroxychloroquine product is obtained after
      recrystallization of ethane. Hydroxychloroquine is added to
      sulfuric acid under ethanol as a solvent to obtain
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The method still has the following disadvantages: 1. The
      condensation reaction is promoted by pressurizing in the
      autoclave, but due to the pressure range of 5-20 bar, there is a
      great safety hazard in industrial application; The post-treatment
      of the reaction is to obtain the hydroxychloroquine product by
      recrystallization after acidification and alkalization, which is
      equivalent to the use of two refinings, and the product yield is
      greatly lost. At the same time, the extraction and
      recrystallization are selected from chloroform and dichloroethane,
      which are all toxic. Large reagents should be avoided in the
      production of APIs.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] CN102050781 discloses an industrial production method of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate: after heating the reaction liquid to
      reflux temperature, then gradually raising the temperature for
      7-12 hours to 120-125 ° C, distilling off the solvent, and then
      maintaining the temperature at 120-125 ° C. 13-18 hours. The
      method prolongs the temperature rise time of the solvent by
      gradually increasing the temperature during the reaction, and
      prolongs the temperature rise reaction time below 120 ° C, and the
      high temperature reaction time is slightly reduced. However, the
      overall reaction time of the method is still long, the impurities
      are still more, and the largest single impurity cannot be
      effectively and stably controlled below 0.1%, and the yield is
      low. The use of a large amount of organic solvent in the
      production process for extraction and crystallization, on the one
      hand increases the cost of the product, on the other hand is not
      conducive to recycling and environmental protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The method in CN103724261 directly raises the temperature
      of the two raw materials under gas protection (13-24 hours), has a
      long reaction time, and the reaction is intense, and generates a
      large amount of impurities, which is acidified after the
      post-treatment, and then a large amount of alkali is alkalized,
      and then The organic solvent is added, so that the organic layer
      contains a large amount of alkali and inorganic salts, and the
      hydroxychloroquine which is crystallized after cooling contains a
      large amount of inorganic salts and impurities, so that the purity
      of the hydroxychloroquine HPLC is only 96%, so that the salt is
      directly obtained by one time. The quality of hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate is often unqualified.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In general, the current method for synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate uses a highly toxic catalyst and
      solvent, which is unfriendly to the environment and increases the
      production cost. In addition, the production process is
      cumbersome, the reaction selectivity is poor, the reaction period
      is long, and special needs are required. The pressure-resistant
      equipment, the post-reaction treatment is cumbersome and difficult
      to operate, the production cost is high, and the product impurity
      content is high. Therefore, it is necessary to further improve the
      method for preparing hydroxychloroquine sulfate in order to obtain
      a more efficient, simpler, more selective, environmentally
      friendly and lower cost method for preparing high-purity
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0014] Summary of the invention</b><b><br>

      <br>
      [0001] Technical field<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to a process for the
      preparation of hydroxychloroquine and its sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Background technique<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, its chemical name is
      2-[[4-[(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)amino]pentyl]ethylamino]-ethanol
      sulfate, CAS No. 747-36- 40. Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was
      successfully developed by Winthrop and first listed in the United
      States in 1956. It has been listed in France, Denmark, Japan,
      Germany, Finland and other countries and regions. On May 29, 1998,
      the US FDA approved hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the
      treatment of lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] US 2,546,658 discloses a process for the synthesis of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the process of which is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0006]<br>
      <br>
      [0007] 4,7-Dichloroquinoline is reacted with
      5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylenediylamino)-2-pentylamine
      (hereinafter referred to as hydroxychloroquine side chain
      compound) to give hydroxychloroquine, which is then sulfated to
      form a salt. The patent was reported in 1951, the process is
      older, the use of equivalent phenol as a solvent, increasing the
      difficulty of post-processing. Phenol is toxic and corrosive. Its
      concentrated solution is strongly corrosive to the skin. After
      treatment, it is converted into sodium phenol wastewater. The
      phenol-containing wastewater is a kind of hazardous and difficult
      to treat in industrial wastewater. It is the key control in China.
      One of the wastewaters has a large environmental pollution, which
      causes pressure on the treatment of the three wastes; the melting
      point of phenol is 42 ° C, which is solid at normal temperature.
      To be successfully fed, it must be heated and dissolved into
      liquid to be charged, and the operation is very cumbersome. The
      method is complicated and unsuitable for industrialization, and
      the yield of the crude hydroxychloroquine obtained is less than
      20%.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] CA2561987 discloses a method for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine. Since the reaction is maintained at 120-130 °
      C for a reaction time of 20-24 h, the impurity content in the
      crude product is high and the purification process is complicated.
      In particular, in the post-treatment, in order to remove the
      deethylhydroxy chloroquine impurity
      (7-chloro-4-(4-N-hydroxyethyl-1-methyl-tertiary amino group) as
      shown in Formula I, a complicated post-treatment process is
      carried out: An amide group forming agent (for example, an acid
      anhydride) is reacted with an impurity of the formula I to form a
      compound of the formula II; and an appropriate amount of a base is
      added to hydrolyze a compound of the formula III; and under the
      same conditions of salt formation using hydroxychloroquine, the
      compound III cannot The salt is formed to remove impurities. In
      this method, the purification process of hydroxychloroquine and
      its sulfate is very complicated, the reaction time of the whole
      route is particularly long, and a large amount of waste water is
      generated, and complicated post-treatment is performed in order to
      remove impurities in the post-treatment. The process is costly and
      is not conducive to industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] W02010027150 also discloses a method for synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which comprises reacting two raw
      materials, after being pressurized with nitrogen or argon to a
      pressure of 5-20 bar, stirring at 80 ° C for 30 min, and heating
      to 100-120 ° C for reaction 4- 6h. After the reaction is
      completed, the hydroxychloroquine is acidified by adding dilute
      hydrochloric acid and chloroform. At this time, the
      hydroxychloroquine hydrochloride is dissolved in the aqueous
      phase, the aqueous phase is collected, alkalized with sodium
      hydroxide, hydroxychloroquine is extracted with chloroform, and
      the chloroform layer is concentrated and then dichlorocide is
      used. The hydroxychloroquine product is obtained after
      recrystallization of ethane. Hydroxychloroquine is added to
      sulfuric acid under ethanol as a solvent to obtain
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The method still has the following disadvantages: 1. The
      condensation reaction is promoted by pressurizing in the
      autoclave, but due to the pressure range of 5-20 bar, there is a
      great safety hazard in industrial application; The post-treatment
      of the reaction is to obtain the hydroxychloroquine product by
      recrystallization after acidification and alkalization, which is
      equivalent to the use of two refinings, and the product yield is
      greatly lost. At the same time, the extraction and
      recrystallization are selected from chloroform and dichloroethane,
      which are all toxic. Large reagents should be avoided in the
      production of APIs.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] CN102050781 discloses an industrial production method of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate: after heating the reaction liquid to
      reflux temperature, then gradually raising the temperature for
      7-12 hours to 120-125 ° C, distilling off the solvent, and then
      maintaining the temperature at 120-125 ° C. 13-18 hours. The
      method prolongs the temperature rise time of the solvent by
      gradually increasing the temperature during the reaction, and
      prolongs the temperature rise reaction time below 120 ° C, and the
      high temperature reaction time is slightly reduced. However, the
      overall reaction time of the method is still long, the impurities
      are still more, and the largest single impurity cannot be
      effectively and stably controlled below 0.1%, and the yield is
      low. The use of a large amount of organic solvent in the
      production process for extraction and crystallization, on the one
      hand increases the cost of the product, on the other hand is not
      conducive to recycling and environmental protection.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The method in CN103724261 directly raises the temperature
      of the two raw materials under gas protection (13-24 hours), has a
      long reaction time, and the reaction is intense, and generates a
      large amount of impurities, which is acidified after the
      post-treatment, and then a large amount of alkali is alkalized,
      and then The organic solvent is added, so that the organic layer
      contains a large amount of alkali and inorganic salts, and the
      hydroxychloroquine which is crystallized after cooling contains a
      large amount of inorganic salts and impurities, so that the purity
      of the hydroxychloroquine HPLC is only 96%, so that the salt is
      directly obtained by one time. The quality of hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate is often unqualified.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In general, the current method for synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate has the use of highly toxic catalysts
      and solvents, which are environmentally unfriendly and increase
      the production cost. In addition, the production process is
      cumbersome, the reaction selectivity is poor, the reaction cycle
      is long, and special resistance is required. The pressure
      equipment, the post-reaction treatment are cumbersome and
      difficult to operate, the production cost is high, and the product
      impurity content is high. Therefore, it is necessary to further
      improve the method for preparing hydroxychloroquine sulfate in
      order to obtain a more efficient, simpler, more selective,
      environmentally friendly and lower cost method for preparing
      high-purity hydroxychloroquine sulfate.<br>
      <br>

      [0010] H.N. Bernstein, Annals of Ophthalmology, 23 , 292-296
      (1991), presents an analysis of all published cases and Food and
      Drug Administration reports of retinopathy induced by
      hydroxychloroquine. The author states that antimalarial therapy,
      because of a relative lack of systemic side effects compared with
      other immunomodulating drugs, has been used increasingly over the
      past 15 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, discoid
      and systemic lupus erythematosus, and other predominantly
      autoimmune diseases, and that in the United States,
      hydroxychloroquine is preferred to chloroquine because it is
      considered significantly less retinotoxic at the current
      recommended maximum dose (400 mg/day, according to the FDA and the
      manufacturer). The author nevertheless notes that physicians are
      concerned about using drugs with retinotoxic potential at higher
      dose levels. He then suggests, inter alia , that the risk of true
      retinopathy is nullified when the maintenance daily dose is based
      on ≦6.5 mg/kg body weight and states that even in the absence of a
      real toxicity risk, it is recommended that a periodic ocular
      examination program be followed because of the retinotoxic history
      associated with hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Drugs having an asymmetric center are, in most instances,
      administered as racemates consisting of a 1:1 mixture of two
      enantiomers. However, since there often are pharmacodynamic and
      pharmacokinetic differences between the two enantiomers,
      therapeutic efficacy may reside entirely or for the most part in
      one of the two enantiomers and therefore may be diluted by the
      other enantiomer in the racemate and, moreover, any adverse effect
      which may be associated with the racemate may be attributable to
      the other enantiomer. In such cases it would be desirable to
      administer the single enantiomer in which the therapeutic efficacy
      resides.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Plaquenil® Sulfate (hydroxychloroquine sulfate) is a
      racemic mixture (1:1) of 2 enantiomers. The manufacturer of this
      drug contraindicates its use, inter alia , in the presence of
      retinal or visual field changes attributable to any
      4-amino-quinoline compound and warns that irreversible retinal
      damage has been observed in some patients who had received long
      term or high-dosage 4-aminoquinoline therapy for discoid and
      systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis and notes
      that retinopathy has been reported to be dose-related. Adverse
      reactions discussed by the manufacturer include a small number of
      cases of retinal changes which have been reported as occurring in
      patients who received only hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Although Plaquenil® Sulfate has an excellent ocular safety
      record when the maintenance dose levels recommended by the
      manufacturer (310 mg base/day) for the treatment of malaria,
      discoid and systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis
      are not exceeded, nevertheless, because cases of retinal changes
      in patients receiving only hydroxychloroquine have been reported
      and physicians are concerned about using drugs with retinotoxic
      potential at higher doses (see H.N. Bernstein, supra ), it would
      be highly desirable if the risk of retinopathy in the use of
      hydroxychloroquine could be substantially reduced, particularly
      for that segment of the population which could benefit from
      hydroxychloroquine therapy but where such therapy is
      contraindicated because of the presence of retinal or visual field
      changes attributable to any 4-aminoquinoline compound.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Unexpectedly, it has now been found that when
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine and its (R)-(―)-antipode were compared
      in the Rat Pleurisy Macrophage Model, which model is used to
      identify disease modifying antirheumatic drugs [see Z.E. Mielens
      et al ., J. Rheumatol., 12 , 1083-1087 (1985)],
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine was approximately 70% more active than
      the corresponding (R)-(―)-enantiomer in decreasing the
      accumulation of cells (monocytes) to the pleural cavity.
      Furthermore, it was found that in a study wherein racemic
      hydroxychloroquine was administered either intravenously,
      subcutaneously or orally to rabbits, there was an enantioselective
      accumulation of (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine in the ocular tissue.
      The ratio of the (R)-(―)-enantiomer to the (S)-(+)-enantiomer in
      this study was 1.58 ± 0.24. These results were consistent with the
      results of pharmacokinetic studies in humans treated with racemic
      hydroxychloroquine in which it was found that for
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine, the fraction absorbed was
      approximately two times greater, the systemic clearance was more
      than two fold greater and the apparent half life was significantly
      faster than for the corresponding (S)-(+)-enantiomer. These
      differences are attributed to enantioselective distribution into
      various tissue compartments such as the retina.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] These unexpected discoveries have important clinical
      implications for hydroxychloroquine therapy in that malaria, lupus
      erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis may now be effectively
      treated with (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine substantially free of
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine with concomitant lower adverse effects
      attributable to the corresponding (R)-(―)-enantiomer with the
      result that it will be possible, where indicated, to administer
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine at higher dose levels and/or longer
      periods of times than is now recommended for administration of
      equivalent dose levels of racemic hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Therefore, in one aspect of the invention there is provided
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine substantially free of
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
      acid-addition salt thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In another aspect there is provided a method for the
      treatment of malaria, lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis
      in a human which comprises administering to the human an amount
      effective to treat malaria, lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid
      arthritis of (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine substantially free of
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine or a pharmaceutically acceptable
      acid-addition salt thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In another aspect the invention provides a composition for
      treating malaria, lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis in a
      human comprising (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine substantially free of
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine or a pharmaceutically acceptable
      acid-addition salt thereof in an amount effective for the
      treatment of malaria, lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis
      and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A further aspect of the invention provides the use in the
      manufacture of a medicament for treating malaria, lupus
      erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis in a human of
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine substantially free of
      (R)-(―)hydroxychloroquine, or a pharmaceutically acceptable
      acid-addition salt thereof. The (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine
      substantially free of (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine, or a
      pharmaceutically acceptable acid-addition salt thereof, is
      preferably present in the medicament in therapeutic amounts
      effective for the treatment of such diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In order to avoid or minimize adverse effects associated
      with the enantioselective accumulation of
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine in ocular tissue, it is preferable in
      practising the invention to use as the active ingredient
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine substantially free of
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine. In this context, the expression
      "substantially free" means that the active ingredient should
      contain at least 90% by weight of (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine and
      10% by weight or less of (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine, preferably at
      least 95% by weight of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer and 5% by weight or
      less of the (R)-(―)-enantiomer and more preferably at least 98% by
      weight and 2% by weight or less of the (R)-(―)-enantiomer. Ideally
      the (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine should be free of
      (R)-(―)-hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Included within the purview of this invention in addition
      to (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine are its pharmaceutically acceptable
      acid-addition salts such as those derived from nontoxic inorganic
      acids, including hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid
      and the like, and nontoxic organic acids, including tartaric acid,
      citric acid, acetic acid and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The composition of the invention can be formulated for oral
      or parenteral administration in solid, liquid or other appropriate
      dosage forms including tablets, capsules and solutions, using
      conventional pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles and techniques.<br>
      The invention will now be described with reference to the
      following Example but is in no way to be construed as limited
      thereto.<br>
      EXAMPLE Preparation of (S)-(+)-Hydroxychloroquine<br>
      <br>
      [0023] (S)-(+)-Hydroxychloroquine was prepared by condensing
      (S)-(+)-2-[(4-aminopentyl)ethylamino]ethanol with
      4,7-dichloroquinoline. The latter compound is known. The
      (S)-(+)-2-[(4-aminopentyl)ethylamino]ethanol was prepared by
      resolving known racemic 2-[(4-aminopentyl)ethylamino]ethanol by
      forming a salt thereof with known (S)-(+)-mandelic acid and
      separating the (S)-(+)-mandelic acid salts of the two enantiomers
      by crystallization.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0024] The following example illustrates the method of
        preparation.</b><b><br>
      </b><b>a) (S)-(+)-2-[(4-Aminopentyl)ethylamine]ethanol.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] A solution of (S)-(+)-mandelic acid (15.9 g, 105 mmol, 0.60
      equivalents) in ethyl alcohol was added to a solution of racemic
      2-[(4-aminopentyl)ethylamino]ethanol (30.37 g, 174 mmol, 1.00
      equivalents) in ethyl ether. The solvents were evaporated and the
      resulting white solid was recrystallized from ethyl alcohol,
      washed with a little ethyl ether, recrystallized again from ethyl
      alcohol and washed with a little ethyl alcohol and then ethyl
      ether. The crystals were dried in vacuo overnight to give 7.45 g
      of salt of the title compound with (S)-(+)-mandelic acid, m.p.
      126-127°C. This salt was dissolved in water and the resulting
      solution was made basic with 35% sodium hydroxide and extracted
      three times with methylene chloride. The combined extracts were
      dried (K₂CO₃), filtered and evaporated. The residue was distilled
      (Kugelrohr; 80-100°C/0.020 tort) to yield the title compound as a
      colorless oil (approximately 3.7 g) which was used as such in the
      next step.<br>
      b) (S)-(+)-Hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] A mixture of the product from (a) above (approximately 3.7
      g, 19.0 mmol, 1.00 equivalents). N-ethyldiisopropylamine (2.45 g,
      20.9 mmol, 1.10 equivalents) and 4,7-dichloroquinoline (3.31 g,
      19.0 mmol, 1.00 equivalents) was heated at reflux under nitrogen
      for 48 hours and cooled. The excess base was poured off and the
      residue was taken up in methyl alcohol and excess aqueous sodium
      hydroxide. The mixture was diluted with water and extracted three
      times with methylene dichloride. The combined organic extracts
      were washed two times with water, once with brine, dried (K₂CO₃),
      filtered and evaporated to dryness. The residue was filtered
      through silica gel with tetrahydrofuran:diethylamine (95:5) to
      give 4.12 g of material. This material was subjected to fractional
      distillation (Kugelrohr). A white crystalline solid was obtained
      at approximately 130°C and 0.010 torr. The receiver bulb was
      changed and the distillation temperature was increased to
      approximately 200°C. This provided 2.93 g of the title compound
      which was converted to its sulfate salt by treatment with one
      equivalent of 1 molar sulfuric acid in methyl alcohol and
      evaporation to a sticky oil. The oily salt was dissolved in 5 ml
      methyl alcohol and acetone was added slowly until the solution
      turned a little murky. This solution was allowed to stand
      overnight at room temperature and the resulting crystalline salt
      was collected and washed with acetone and dried at 50°C (0.01
      torr) for twenty-four hours to give approximately 390 mg of
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine sulfate as an off-white solid, m.p.
      235-238°C(dec.); [α]D = +105.9 (1% in H₂O). It was determined by
      direct chromatographic resolution via high performance liquid
      chromatography using a chiral stationary phase that this material
      contained 98.4% by weight of the (S)-(+)-enantiomer and 1.6% by
      weight of the (R)-(―)-enantiomer.<br>

      lowered, water is added to the reaction system to dissolve, and
      the alkalization layer is separated, the aqueous phase is
      discarded, and the organic phase is crystallized by adding an
      organic solvent to obtain hydroxychloroquine. In the method,
      hydroxychloroquine is easily precipitated as an oil during the
      acid-base treatment, and a large amount of alkali and inorganic
      salts are easily mixed, so that the purity of the crude
      hydroxychloroquine is not high, and the quality of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate obtained directly for salt formation is
      often unqualified.<br>

      of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, which dissolves
      4,7-dichloroquinoline and hydroxychloroquine side chain in an
      acetate solvent, and adds sodium alkoxide as a catalyst to
      gradually heat up the acetate solvent by distillation. The
      condensation reaction is carried out in a manner, and after the
      reaction is completed, the pH is adjusted to 9-10 by adding a 5%
      aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, extracted with an organic
      solvent of an acetate, washed, crystallized to obtain
      hydroxychloroquine, and then a mixture solvent of
      hydroxychloroquine and sulfuric acid in an alcohol-water mixture
      is obtained. The salt formation reaction is carried out in the
      system. In comparison, the method described in this patent is
      simpler, and its main disadvantage is that the solubility of
      hydroxychloroquine in the acetate solvent is small, and the
      solvent required for extracting hydroxychloroquine using an
      acetate solvent in the post-treatment is used. Great amount.<br>

      PURPOSE: A method for preparing hydroxychloroquine is provided to
      suppress generation of by-product by reducing reaction temperature
      and time and prepare the hydroxychloroquine with high yield and
      purity. CONSTITUTION: A hydroxychloroquine of chemical formula 1
      is prepared by reacting... step of reacting sulfuric acid with
      hydroxychloroquine to obtain hydroxychloroquine sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a method for producing
      hydroxychloroquine which is a therapeutic agent for malaria.<br>
      <br>
      Hydroxychloroquine has the structure of the following formula 1
      and its chemical name is 2 - [[4- [7-chloro-4-quinolinyl] amino]
      pentyl] 4- [7-chloro-4-quinolinyl] amino] pentyl] -ethylamino]
      ethanol} was first disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,546,658.
      N'-N'-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentanediamine {N'ethyl-N ',
      N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate)
      β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine} was reacted with potassium iodide
      (KI) and a phenol solvent at 125-130 ° C. for 18 hours or longer
      to prepare crude hydroxychloroquine, (S) -N'ethyl-N '[beta]
      -hydro-quinoline in the case of U.S. Pat. No. 5,314,894, (S) - (+)
      - hydroxycroquinoline {(R) - (R) -methyl-2- S) - (+) -
      hydroxychloroquine}. In Canadian patent CA 2,561,987,
      4,7-dichloroquinoline (2) and N'ethyl- After reacting
      cyethyl-1,4-pentadiyimine (3) at 120-130 ° C for 20-24 hours, a
      protecting group is introduced into the reaction product as
      follows to easily remove the impurities, and then the protecting
      group is hydrolyzed (PG in formula (A), (B) and (C) means a
      protecting group). However, the known processes for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine and its acid addition salt include a method of
      producing toxic phenol Use of the same solvent or a reagent such
      as N, N-diisopropylethylamine having a high boiling point and a
      similar form to the final product makes it difficult to remove
      by-products during the production of the acid salt. Moreover,
      since the long reaction time at high temperature increases the
      production cost and increases the production of by-products, there
      is a demand for a method of synthesizing hydroxychloroquine and
      dicellulose salt, which is more efficient in the industrial field.
      It is necessary to develop new synthesis method of
      hydroxychloroquine which overcomes various disadvantages and shows
      high purity and yield.<br>
      <br>
      An object of the present invention is to provide a novel process
      for the production of hydroxychloroquine which suppresses the
      production of by-products and reduces the production cost by
      significantly lowering the reaction temperature and the reaction
      time by using a pressure without using a catalyst and a reaction
      solvent The present invention relates to a novel process for the
      preparation of hydroxychloroquine using pressure, which comprises
      reacting 4,7-dichloroquinoline and N'-ethyl-N '?
      -Hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentanediamine at high pressure The process of
      the present invention can be carried out by reacting
      4,7-dichloroquinoline with N, N'-ethyl-N'-tetrachloroquinoline
      without using a catalyst and a solvent, In the present invention,
      the high pressure means a pressure exceeding 1 atm (about 1 bar)
      higher than the atmospheric pressure, and a pressure of 5 bar to
      30 b The high pressure in the present invention is due to inert
      gas such as nitrogen gas or argon gas or air without moisture. In
      the present invention, the reaction time is preferably 10 to 20
      bar, The reaction temperature may be varied within a range of 80
      to 150 ° C. and more preferably 100 to 120 ° C. In the present
      invention, 4, The reaction molar ratio of 7-dichloroquinoline and
      N'-ethyl-N '? -Hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine can be varied, but is
      preferably 1: 1.05 to 1.5, more preferably 1: 1.05-1.1 The present
      invention also provides a process for preparing hydroxy
      chloroquinone represented by the following formula (1): (a)
      reacting 4,7-dichloroquinoline with N'ethyl-N '?
      -Hydroxyethyl-1,4- And (b) reacting the hydroxides prepared in
      step (a) The present invention also provides a process for
      preparing hydroxychloroquine sulfate comprising reacting
      chloroquine with sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to prepare
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The reaction conditions of step (a)
      are as described above. The method for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine according to the present invention is
      characterized in that 4,7-dichloroquinoline and N'-ethyl-N '?
      -Hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentanediamine are reacted with 1 : 1.1 molar
      ratio, put into a high-pressure reactor and pressurize with
      nitrogen pressure from 5 bar to 20 bar, preferably from 10 bar to
      15 bar. The mixture is stirred at 80 ° C for 30 minutes until the
      4,7-dichloroquinoline is dissolved, and then stirred at 100 ° C to
      120 ° C for 4 hours to 6 hours. , The reaction temperature and the
      reaction time are remarkably lowered to inhibit the production of
      by-products, and hydroxychloroquine is produced at a high purity
      and a high yield, and the production cost is reduced.<br>
      <br>

      be described in order to facilitate understanding of the present
      invention. However, the following examples are provided only for

      <b>[0003] Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] The structure of hydroxychloroquine sulfate is shown below.
      Its chemical name is 2-[[4-[(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl) amino] pentyl]
      ethylamino] -ethanol sulfate, CAS number is 747-36- 4.
      Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was successfully developed by Winthrop
      Corporation. It was first listed in the United States in 1956 and
      has been listed in many countries and regions such as France,
      Denmark, Japan, Germany, and Finland. The US FDA approved
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the treatment of lupus
      erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis on May 29, 1998.<br>

      <br>
      [0006] CA2561987 discloses a method for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine, the method is as follows,<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The method includes sequentially adding isopropyl alcohol
      (2vol), 4-amino-N-ethyl- (2-hydroxyethyl) -pentylamine (1.5eq,
      0.75mol), 4,7-dichloroquinoline (1.0eq, 0.5mol), stir, heat, stir
      at 120-130 ℃ for 20-24h, then cool to 70-80 ℃, add water (2vol)
      and methyl isobutyl ketone (3vol), adjust the pH at 10-11, min
      Liquid, add acetic anhydride (0.1eq) to the organic layer, stir at
      room temperature overnight, then add LiOH-H2O (0.25eq), water
      (0.5vol) and methanol (0.5vol) in sequence, the mixture was
      stirred at room temperature overnight, Wash again with water. Add
      methanol (5vol) and sulfuric acid (1.0eq, 0.5mol) to the organic
      layer, heat to 35-45 ° C and stir for 3-4h, then cool to 20-25 °
      C, filter, and wash the filter cake with methanol to obtain
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate Crude product, yield 80%,
      chromatographic purity greater than 99.5%. The impurity
      7-chloro-4- (4-N-hydroxyethyl-1-methyl tertiary amino) quinoline
      is less than 0.1%. Add the crude product obtained above (200.0g),
      water (1L) and methyl isobutyl ketone (800ml), stir to dissolve,
      cool to 0-5 ℃, add 5N sodium hydroxide until the pH is 10.5-11.0,
      Stir at room temperature for 0.5-1h, separate the liquid, add 5%
      sodium chloride solution (200ml) to the organic layer and wash
      with activated carbon (20.0g), stir at room temperature, filter,
      wash the filter cake with methanol (200ml), spin-dry the filtrate,
      Get hydroxychloroquine. The purification process of
      hydroxychloroquine and its sulfate in this method is very
      complicated, especially in the post-treatment to remove ethyl
      impurities (7-chloro-4- (4-N-hydroxyethyl-1-methyl tertiary amino)
      After a complicated post-processing process, the impurities are
      finally controlled to less than 0.1%, which has high cost and long
      time, which is not conducive to industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] US2546658 (equivalent to GB680255, DE838142) discloses a
      synthesis method of hydroxychloroquine. The reaction process of
      this method is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0010]<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The operation of this method is as follows:
      4,7-dichloroquinoline (90g), phenol (90g), potassium iodide
      (1.0g), 5- (N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamino) -2 -Pentylamine (132g),
      stirred, heated, stirred at 125-130 ° C for 18h, after which the
      reaction solution was cooled, methanol (1.9L) was added, the
      reaction solution was filtered with charcoal, and the clear
      filtrate was added to methanol (300ml) Phosphoric acid (100g),
      wipe the wall with a glass rod and let it stand for 2 days,
      suction filtration, washing the filter cake with methanol and
      drying to obtain hydroxychloroquine diphosphate (10lg), yield
      41.9%, melting point 155-156 ° C. The obtained phosphate was
      dissolved in water, completely dissociated with ammonium
      hydroxide, extracted with chloroform, distilled off chloroform,
      and the residue was recrystallized with ether to obtain crude
      hydroxychloroquine (30g), melting point 77-82 ° C, yield 44.3%.
      Dichloromethane and ethyl acetate can be further added to
      recrystallize to obtain pure hydroxychloroquine, melting point
      89-91 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The method of US2546658 uses phenol with a weight ratio of
      1: 1 as the reaction catalyst. Phenol is toxic and corrosive. Its
      concentrated solution is strongly corrosive to the skin. After
      treatment, it is converted into sodium phenol wastewater.
      Phenol-containing wastewater is one of the most harmful and
      difficult to treat in industrial wastewater. It is one of the
      wastewaters that are currently controlled in China. It has a large
      environmental pollution; phenol has a melting point of 42 ° C and
      is solid at room temperature. To successfully feed, it must be
      heated to dissolve into a liquid In order to feed, the operation
      is very cumbersome, and industrial production is difficult; the
      reaction does not involve the solvent, the material is very
      viscous, and the selectivity of mass transfer, heat transfer,
      transmission, and reaction is very poor. It is necessary to remove
      impurities by forming phosphate, 4, 7-two The yield of
      chloroquinoline to crude hydroxychloroquine is 44.3%, the
      production cost is high, and it is difficult to implement
      industrial production. At the same time, this method is not
      suitable for industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] WO2010027150 also discloses a method for synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, whose reaction circuit is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The method includes sequentially adding
      4,7-dichloroquinoline, 4-amino-N-ethyl- (2-hydroxyethyl)
      -pentylamine, pressurizing with nitrogen or argon to maintain the
      pressure at 5-20bar Stir at 30 ° C for 30min, warm to 100-120 ° C
      and react for 4-6h. After the reaction is complete, add dilute
      hydrochloric acid and chloroform to acidify hydroxychloroquine. At
      this time, hydroxychloroquine forms a hydrochloride and dissolves
      in the aqueous phase. After collecting the aqueous phase, add
      sodium hydroxide to alkalinize and extract hydroxychloroquine with
      chloroform. The chloroform layer is concentrated and
      dichloromethane is used after concentration. The
      hydroxychloroquine product is obtained after crystallization of
      ethane. Hydroxychloroquine is added with sulfuric acid under the
      condition of ethanol as a solvent to obtain hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The method of <b>WO2010027150</b> still has the following
      disadvantages:<br>
      <br>
      [0017] 1、Promote the condensation reaction by pressurizing in the
      autoclave, but because the pressure range is 5-20 bar, it has
      great safety risks in industrial applications;<br>
      <br>
      [0018] 2、The post-treatment of the reaction is to obtain
      hydroxychloroquine product by recrystallization after
      acidification and alkalization, which is equivalent to two
      refinings, and the product yield is greatly lost. At the same
      time, chloroform and dichloroethane are selected for extraction
      and recrystallization, which are both toxic Very large reagents
      should be avoided in the production of APIs.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] According to the three methods disclosed above, the method
      of CA2561987 has certain advantages in environmental protection
      and reaction conditions compared to other methods. No toxic
      reagents and high pressure are used. However, the reaction time is
      maintained at 120-130 ° C for up to 20 -24h, it will cause the
      impurity content in the crude product to be too high, increasing
      the post-treatment pressure, and also has the following prominent
      shortcomings:<br>
      <br>
      [0020] 1、The control of the reaction also needs to be refined. If
      the temperature rise process of the reaction is strictly
      controlled, the content of by-products in the crude product will
      be further reduced, and at the same time, the conversion rate of
      the product will be improved and the production cost will be
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] 2、5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamino) -2-pentylamine
      (referred to as "hydroxychloroquine side chain" in the present
      invention) is used in a large amount, and the amount of
      hydroxychloroquine side chain is 4,7-di The 2-3 times of
      chloroquinoline makes the hydroxychloroquine side chain account
      for a large proportion of the cost, resulting in too high
      production costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] 3、In order to remove 7-chloro-4- (4-N-hydroxyethyl-1-methyl
      tertiary amino) quinoline during the post-treatment of the
      reaction, a more expensive methyl isobutyl ketone was used, and
      the steps were complicated , Increasing production costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] 4、There are many overnight treatment operations in
      post-processing, and there will be uncertainty in the operation
      time when applied to production, resulting in production
      deviations.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] In general, the current methods of synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate use highly toxic catalysts and
      solvents, the synthesis route is lengthy, the reaction selectivity
      is poor, the reaction period is long, special pressure-resistant
      equipment is required, the post-reaction treatment is cumbersome
      and difficult to operate, and the production cost is high ,
      Insufficient product content, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to
      further improve the method for preparing hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate in order to obtain a more efficient, simpler, more
      selective, more environmentally friendly, and lower cost method
      for preparing high-purity hydroxychloroquine sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0025] Summary of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0026] The purpose of the present invention is to provide an
      industrial preparation method for hydroxychloroquine sulfate. This
      method can increase the purity of hydroxychloroquine in the
      reaction solution by controlling the temperature and time of
      distilling off the solvent by gradually raising the temperature
      during the reaction process and the reaction time. With regard to
      the content of related impurities, hydroxychloroquine sulfate with
      higher yield and high purity is obtained, with a purity ≥ 99.7%
      and a single impurity ≤ 0.1%. The method also avoids the use of
      toxic solvents and catalysts, which is beneficial to environmental
      protection. The reaction conditions are mild, high pressure is
      avoided, the amount of hydroxychloroquine side chains is reduced,
      the post-processing is simple, and the production cost is
      significantly reduced. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for
      industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] To achieve the purpose of the present invention, the
      following embodiments are provided:<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In one embodiment, an industrial preparation method of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate of the present invention includes:<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Condensation reaction of 4,7-dichloroquinoline and
      hydroxychloroquine side chain in an organic solvent by heating and
      gradually distilling off the solvent to obtain crude
      hydroxychloroquine, which is recrystallized to obtain
      hydroxychloroquine, which is then converted into sulfuric acid
      Salt reaction to produce hydroxychloroquine sulfate,<br>
      <br>
      [0030]<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The method is characterized in that: the method of
      gradually raising the temperature to distill off the solvent
      includes: after heating the reaction solution to the initial
      reflux temperature, then distilling off the solvent by gradually
      raising the temperature for 7-12 hours to 120-125 ° C, preferably
      9-10 hours, and then maintaining The reaction temperature is 120 °
      C to 125 ° C for 13 to 18 hours, preferably 14 to 16 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In the above embodiment, the organic solvent is selected
      from propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and their mixed solvents,
      preferably isopropanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In the above scheme, the molar ratio of
      4,7-dichloroquinoline to hydroxychloroquine side chain is 1: 1.2.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In the above embodiment, the recrystallization is performed
      in an organic solvent selected from the group consisting of
      ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate, and mixed solvents thereof,
      preferably ethyl acetate and isopropanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In the above embodiment, the hydroxychloroquine reacts with
      concentrated sulfuric acid to form a salt, wherein the weight
      ratio of hydroxychloroquine to concentrated sulfuric acid is 1:
      0.25 to 0.30.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In the above embodiment, the hydroxychloroquine reacts with
      concentrated sulfuric acid to form a salt, and the appropriate
      solvent is selected from ethanol, isopropanol, ethyl acetate and
      their mixed solvents, preferably ethyl acetate and ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In the above embodiment, after the reaction of
      4,7-dichloroquinoline and hydroxychloroquine side chain is
      completed, the reaction product is extracted with dichloromethane,
      and the extract is distilled by heating to remove the
      dichloromethane to obtain crude hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The term "hydroxychloroquine side chain" refers to the
      starting material "5- (N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamino)
      -2-pentylamine".<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In the industrial preparation method of hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate of the present invention, in optimizing the preparation
      process of hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the inventors were
      surprised to find that the temperature in the reaction mixture of
      4,7-dichloroquinoline and hydroxychloroquine side chain was
      controlled by stage heating The temperature and time for the
      organic solvent to evaporate, that is, during the evaporation of
      the organic solvent, it takes 7-12 hours to gradually increase the
      temperature from the temperature at the beginning of the reflux to
      120-125 ℃, and the reaction under the conditions of 120 ℃ ~ 125 ℃
      The time is shortened to 13-18 hours. At the same time, the lower
      molar ratio of 4,7-dichloroquinoline and hydroxychloroquine side
      chain can achieve the best balance between cost and yield, thereby
      reducing the amount of hydroxychloroquine side chain. The
      hydroxychloroquine with purity ≥ 99.5% can be obtained only by
      recrystallization during treatment. The purity of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate after salt formation can reach 99.7% or
      more (determined by HPLC external standard method), and its single
      impurity ≤ 0.1%.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The industrial preparation method of hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate of the invention has few preparation steps, simple
      process, high product purity, ideal yield, mild reaction
      conditions (no pressurized conditions), and avoids the use of
      corrosive reagents, which is less harmful to the environment and
      more suitable For industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Through the follow-up monitoring of the reaction state, we
      found that the condensation reaction is the main temperature range
      for the production of by-products at 125-130 ° C. If the reaction
      time is too long within this temperature range, the by-products of
      the product will increase, resulting in an increase in the content
      of impurities The inventors found that the conversion of raw
      materials and the control of impurities achieved the best balance
      by exploring the reaction temperature and time, and found that by
      controlling the heating method of the temperature-increasing
      reaction, first, by extending the temperature-rising reaction time
      below 120 ° C, the reaction was promoted as much as possible The
      conversion at this temperature improves the conversion rate of the
      raw material 4,7-dichloroquinoline; then the reaction time is
      reduced to 120-125 ° C and the reaction time is shortened to 13-18
      hours in order to minimize side reactions at this high temperature
      Production, reduce the impurity content in the product. Due to the
      greatly reduced content of impurities, there is no need to use
      methyl isobutyl ketone, only one-step recrystallization using
      low-cost common solvents to obtain high-purity hydroxychloroquine
      products, its purity can reach more than 99.5%, while a single
      impurity ≤0.1%. By using this purity hydroxychloroquine to form a
      salt, hydroxychloroquine sulfate with a purity greater than 99.7%
      and a single impurity ≤0.1% can be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In short, the beneficial effects of the present invention
      are as follows: The present invention discloses a method for
      preparing hydroxychloroquine sulfate, using 4,7-dichloroquinoline
      as the starting material, and hydroxychloroquine sulfate is
      prepared by condensation and salt formation in two steps; The
      condensation reaction uses propanol, isopropanol, one or more of
      n-butanol as a solvent, and gradually increases the conversion
      rate and yield of the reaction by means of stage heating. For the
      crude product of hydroxychloroquine, ethanol, isopropanol, and
      ethyl acetate are used Recrystallization of esters or their mixed
      solvents improves the purity of hydroxychloroquine and keeps its
      purity above 99.5%; selecting a suitable solvent as a solvent in
      the salt formation reaction can further purify the product,
      improve product yield and quality, and reduce The production cost
      makes the purity of hydroxychloroquine sulfate HPLC external
      standard method above 99.7%, and the single impurity below 0.1%.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The method of the present invention does not use highly
      toxic reagents, the reaction and post-treatment processes are
      simple and controllable, no special pressure equipment is used,
      the environmental pollution is small, and it is very suitable for
      industrial production.<br>

      <br>
      [0006] Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was successfully developed by
      Winthrop and first listed in the United States in 1956. It was
      later listed in France, Denmark, Japan, Germany, Finland and other
      countries and regions. On May 29, 1998, the US FDA approved
      hydroxychloroquine sulphate tablets for the treatment of lupus
      erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>

      [0009] The patent was reported in 1951, using a large amount of
      phenol as a reaction catalyst. Phenol is toxic and corrosive. Its
      concentrated solution is highly corrosive to the skin. The
      post-treatment wastewater causes great pressure on the treatment
      of three wastes, and the phenol-containing wastewater It is a kind
      of waste that is very hazardous in industrial wastewater and
      difficult to handle. It is one of the wastewaters that are
      currently controlled in China, and the environmental pollution is
      particularly large. The melting point of phenol is 42 ° C, which
      is solid at normal temperature, and must be heated to liquid to be
      fed. This process is very cumbersome, unsuitable for
      industrialization, and the yield is also low.<br>

      give hydroxychloroquine. Then, it is salted with concentrated
      sulfuric acid in an anhydrous alcohol solvent to obtain a
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate product. The purification process of
      hydroxychloroquine and its sulfate in this method is very
      complicated, the reaction time of the whole route is particularly
      long, and a large amount of waste water is generated. In the
      post-treatment, a complicated post-treatment process is carried
      out in order to remove impurities, and finally the single impurity
      is controlled at 0.1. Below %, there are cumbersome operations,
      high cost, and long time, which is not conducive to industrial
      production. The salt forming process is to directly add
      concentrated sulfuric acid to an anhydrous alcohol solvent, and
      there is a risk of producing toxic substances such as dimethyl
      sulfate and diethyl sulfate.<br>

      applying nitrogen or argon gas to a pressure of 5 to 20 bar, and
      then reacting at 100 ° C to 120 ° C for 4 to 6 hours. After the

      with chloroform, and the chloroform layer is concentrated and then
      recrystallized from dichloroethane. Hydroxychloroquine products.
      Hydroxychloroquine is then added to the concentrated sulfuric acid
      under anhydrous ethanol as a solvent to obtain hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate. The method is carried out under high pressure, and there
      is a certain safety hazard, and the alkalization loss is great
      after acidification first, and a highly toxic solvent such as
      chloroform and dichloroethane is also used, which is difficult to
      remove in the hydroxychloroquine sulfate product. According to the
      ICH (International Coordinating Committee for the Registration of
      Technical Requirements for Human Drugs), the requirements for the
      Guideline for Residual Solvents, dichloroethane is the first type
      of solvent and should be strictly prohibited. Chloroform is the
      second type of solvent and should be controlled. Moreover, the
      limit is 60 ppm, and it is difficult to completely remove the two
      types of solvents in the finished product.<br>

      reaction is gradually heated to 120 ° C to 130 ° C during the
      reaction. After 13 to 24 hours, the mixture is acidified, and the
      excess liquid is alkalized and then layered, and crystallized by
      adding an organic solvent to obtain hydroxychloroquine. The method
      directly raises the temperature of the two raw materials, and the
      reaction is too strong, and a large amount of impurities are
      generated. After the post-treatment, acidification, a large amount
      of liquid alkali alkalization, and then an organic solvent is
      added, so that the organic layer contains a large amount of alkali
      liquid and inorganic The salt, the crude hydroxychloroquine
      crystallized after cooling, contains a large amount of inorganic
      salts and impurities, so that the crude purity of
      hydroxychloroquine is only 96%, so that the quality of

      contains halogenated hydrocarbon genotoxic impurities such as
      chloroform and dichloroethane, which does not meet the
      requirements of the ICH Guidelines for Residual Solvents. In the
      case of hydroxychloroquine sulfate formation, most of the process
      uses concentrated sulfuric acid under anhydrous alcohol
      conditions, which may present the risk of producing dimethyl
      sulfate and diethyl sulfate. Therefore, it is very necessary to
      find an industrial preparation method which is simple in

        Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>The invention discloses a side chain, a synthesis method
      thereof, and a method for synthesizing hydroxychloroquine sulfate
      from the side chain. The synthesis method of the side chain
      comprises the following steps: 1, condensing N-ethylethanolamine
      and 5-chloro-2-pentanone to obtain a condensation product; 2,
      esterifying the condensation product and an acetyl reagent to
      obtain an esterification product; 3, reducing the esterification
      product to obtain a reduction product; and 4, reacting the
      reduction product with a halogenating agent to obtain the side
      chain. The synthesis method of the hydroxychloroquine sulfate
      comprises the following steps: 1, reacting
      4-amino-7-chloroquinoline with paratoluensulfonyl chloride to
      obtain 4-Tos-amino-7-chloroquinoline; 2, reacting the side chain
      with the 4-Tos-amino-7-chloroquinoline to obtain a hydroxyquine
      base; and 3, reacting the hydroxyquine base with sulfuric acid to
      obtain the hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The synthesis method of the
      new side chain avoids the ammonification process and the catalytic
      hydrogenation process, and is safe and environmentally friendly,
      and the hydroxychloroquine sulfate can be obtained through
      low-temperature condensation of the side chain, so the quality of
      the above products is remarkably improved, and the production flow
      is simplified.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] Technical field<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention belongs to the field of medicine and chemical
      industry, in particular to a side chain and a synthesis method
      thereof, and a method for synthesizing hydroxychloroquine sulfate
      using the side chain.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0003] Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Hydroxychloroquine sulfate, chemical name 2-4-
      (7-chloro-4-quinolyl) aminopentylethylamino-ethanol sulfate,
      English name: Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate, the chemical structure
      is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an anti-malarial drug
      consisting of 4-aminoquinoline compounds, synthesized in 1946 by
      Surrey and Hammer. Clinic for the treatment of discoid lupus
      erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus, has also been
      widely used in rheumatoid-related diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a common skin and
      mucous membrane connective tissue disease, 25% -35% have oral
      damage, can be issued in the mouth without incidental skin damage,
      and more no obvious systemic symptoms. The etiology and
      pathogenesis is not yet clear, the treatment is more difficult,
      easy to relapse and cancer. Traditional application of chloroquine
      phosphate (CQ) for the treatment of DLE, but the side effects. HCQ
      has anti-inflammatory, anti-amine and immunosuppressive effects,
      reducing lymphocyte conversion, inhibiting vascular permeability,
      stabilizing lysosomal membranes, so the treatment of DLE with HCQ
      targeted. So far, HCQ is considered more secure than CQ. A large
      number of clinical and literature reports confirmed the use of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) treatment of DLE obtained
      satisfactory results.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a multi-systemic
      disease with many kinds of antibodies in the body. The etiology
      and treatment are difficult and difficult to treat. While
      antimalarial drugs used to treat SLE began in 1950, Dobois found
      that after 75% -80% of SLE patients were treated with antimalarial
      drugs, rashes, fever, and joint symptoms improved, especially for
      skin lesions. Subsequent research found that anti-malarial drugs
      can reduce or stop the use of corticosteroids in patients with SLE
      and have anti-allergic effects. A double-blind controlled study by
      Hydroxychloro in Canada showed that HCQ can stabilize SLE patients
      and significantly reduce recurrence. Wallace et al found that HCQ
      treatment can reduce the level of blood lipid in patients with
      corticosteroid-dependent, can significantly reduce the incidence
      of thrombosis. Given that HCQ can have a beneficial effect on SLE,
      most scholars advocate that HCQ is used in patients with mild to
      moderate SLE, combined with hormones and immunosuppressants for
      adjuvant treatment of severe SLE.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] 90% of foreign countries choose hydroxychloroquine when
      applying anti-malarial drugs to treat SLE, while domestic may be
      affected by such factors as cognition and drug source, and most
      choose chloroquine. In fact, from a security point of view, if the
      patient's condition allows, do not need to rely on antimalarial
      drugs in a short period of time to play a curative effect, should
      try to choose hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] As scientists further study found that hydroxychloroquine
      can play a variety of immune regulation in rheumatic diseases, the
      preferred hydroxychloroquine has a significant anti-inflammatory
      effect, it can stabilize the lysosome, inhibit enzyme activity,
      thereby inhibiting the activation of inflammatory mediators ,
      While inhibiting the chemotaxis and infiltration of inflammatory
      cells such as neutrophils and significantly reducing the
      production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-ɑ, IL-1 and
      IL-6; second, hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the growth of
      fibroblasts And connective tissue deposition and thus inhibit
      synovial hyperplasia in patients with arthritis;
      hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the interaction of antigen and
      antibody and immune complex synthesis, to reduce the titer of
      rheumatoid factor; hydroxychloroquine can also affect the
      absorption of ultraviolet light and block UV damage to the skin.
      All of the above are hydroxychloroquine in clinical treatment of
      rheumatic diseases provide a large number of basis. In addition,
      many centers of large-scale clinical studies also confirmed
      hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of rheumatism play a
      significant therapeutic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] At present, the synthesis of hydroxychloroquine sulfuric
      acid generally take the following synthetic route:<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The core of this route is that 5-

      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The process is older, the use of phenol as a solvent,
      phenol is toxic and corrosive, serious environmental pollution,
      post-processing complex, not suitable for industrial production,
      and the yield is relatively low, below 20%.<br>

      the yield of hydroxyquinoline base of hydroxychloroquine side
      chain and 4,7-dichloroquinoline, ie high temperature reaction.
      Although the purity of the product is above 99.5%, the solvent
      isobutyl Ketones and reagents Lithium hydroxide high prices, high
      cost of raw materials, and cumbersome methods of operation, a long
      time, is not conducive to industrial production.<br>

      <br>
      [0020]<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The law is still high temperature reaction, and the need
      for high-pressure reaction, a higher security risk.<br>

      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0023]<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The method uses inert gas to reduce the risk of oxidation
      impurities, but it is still a high temperature reaction. The side
      reactions such as dehydration and condensation can not be avoided
      and the corresponding impurities still exist. The purity of the
      reported HPLC can only ensure ≧ 99.2%.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Hydroxychloroquine side chain is the synthesis of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate key intermediates, reported in the
      literature there are two synthetic methods: Route one is the first
      5-chloro-2-pentanone first prepared as a ketal, and then N-ethyl
      ethanolamine Reaction to give 5- (N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine)
      -2-pentanone, and then by ammoniation, hydrogenation
      hydroxychloroquine side chain; Route two, Reaction of pentanone
      with N-ethylethanolamine gives 5- (N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine)
      -2-pentanone, which is then aminated and hydrogenated to reduce
      the hydroxychloroquine side chain. Ammonia or high concentration
      of liquid ammonia is required for both routes. Ammonia or high
      concentration of liquid ammonia is required, and the odor is
      heavy, adversely affecting the environment. Simultaneously, the
      imine is subjected to high pressure hydrogenation to prepare an
      amino group, which has a high safety risk. In 2015, CN104803859A
      disclosed a method for synthesizing 5-
      (N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine) -2-pentylamine, that is, a method
      for synthesizing hydroxychloroquine side chain. The synthetic
      route is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0026]<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In summary, the current synthesis of hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate there are two main adverse factors: First,
      hydroxychloroquine side chain preparation: the need to use ammonia
      or high concentrations of liquid ammonia, heavy smell, the adverse
      impact on the environment, while imine Need high-pressure
      hydrogenation to reduce the amino group, the safety risk is high;
      Second, hydroxychloroquine base preparation: 4,7-Dichloroquinoline
      4 chlorine activity is relatively low, and can not only use
      catalysts such as potassium bromide, potassium iodide catalytic ,
      Therefore, it is necessary to react under high temperature. During
      the reaction of high temperature, -NH2 and -OH at the end of
      hydroxychloroquine side chain are easily oxidized, dehydrated,
      condensed and so on. Therefore, if it is necessary to ensure the
      product quality, a relatively complicated post-treatment process
      And use a lot of organic solvents. In addition, the existing
      synthetic route also has the defects of long production cycle,
      high impurity content, low yield and high raw material cost.
      Therefore, it is of great social significance and significant
      economic value to design an industrialized synthetic route with
      simple process, mild reaction conditions, high safety and
      environmental protection, high yield and high quality, and low
      manufacturing cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Content of the invention<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The purpose of the present invention is to provide a side
      chain and a method for synthesizing the same, and a method for
      synthesizing hydroxychloroquine sulfate using the side chain. The
      method for synthesizing the side chain can avoid the use of
      ammonia or high-concentration liquid ammonia on the one hand and
      does not require high pressure On the other hand, the synthesized
      new side chain replaces the hydroxychloroquine side chain, and the
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate can be synthesized at the lower
      reaction temperature, which can avoid hydroxychloroquine side
      chain -NH2 and -OH reaction occurs under high temperature
      conditions, help to ensure product quality, and does not require
      cumbersome after-treatment process.<br>

      <b>[0003] Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Hydroxychloroquine (formula I), chemically named
      7-chloro-4-[5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethyl-2-pentyl] aminoquinoline,
      is a 4-aminoquinoline Drugs, originally used clinically for the
      treatment of anti-Plasmodium, are now widely used in the treatment
      of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus,
      and are also the first choice for the treatment of rheumatoid
      arthritis. In addition, they have immunosuppressive and
      anti-inflammatory reactions. Other aspects also have applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Hydroxychloroquine is synthesized from
      4,7-dichloroquinoline and
      5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine)-2-pentylamine in a
      cost-synthetic reaction, among which 5-(N-ethyl)
      -N-2-hydroxyethylamine)-2-pentylamine (Formula II), also known as
      hydroxychloroquine side chain, is a key intermediate for the
      synthesis of hydroxychloroquine. There are seven kinds of raw
      materials and intermediates involved in the synthesis route of a
      hydroxychloroquine side chain (Formula III) disclosed in Chinese
      Patent (Published: CN 104803859 A), which are ethylamine (Formula
      1) and xylene (Formula 1). 5) Ethylamine Ethanol (Formula 2),
      Chloropentene (Formula 4), Ethylamine Diethanolamine (Formula 3),
      and Amino Pentoxone (Formula 6). Residues of intermediates with
      incomplete raw materials and reactions in the reaction The high
      purity results in low purity of the target product and will affect
      the yield of hydroxychloroquine synthesized with
      4,7-dichloroquinoline in the later period, thereby reducing the
      quality and clinical efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, it
      is particularly necessary to carry out quality control during the
      synthesis of hydroxychloroquine side chains.<br>
      <br>
      [0007]<br>
      <br>
      [0008] From the structural formula of the hydroxychloroquine side
      chain, it is known that there is no conjugation effect and
      significant ultraviolet absorption, and it is generally difficult
      to analyze it by liquid chromatography, which is simple,
      convenient, and cost-effective. In addition, the raw materials and
      intermediates of the hydroxychloroquine side chain are all liquid
      and have the characteristics of small molecular weight and good
      thermal stability. Therefore, gas chromatography is suitable for
      analysis. Gas chromatography (GC) technology has the
      characteristics of high efficiency, convenience, and accurate
      separation. It has become an important research field for
      instrument analysis and provides an indispensable important
      analysis basis for the disciplines of physics, chemistry, and
      medicine. Today, GC is a very mature technology and its
      application will continue to deepen and expand.<br>

      hydroxychloroquine side chains and their raw materials and
      intermediates by gas chromatography<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline drug. It was first
      used clinically for the treatment of anti-parasites. It is now
      widely used in the treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus and
      systemic lupus erythematosus. It is also the first choice for the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. . In addition, there are also
      applications in immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory reactions.
      The hydroxychloroquine side chain is a key intermediate for the
      synthesis of hydroxychloroquine. There are seven kinds of raw
      materials and intermediates involved in the synthesis of
      hydroxychloroquine side chain lines. The excessive amount of raw
      materials and incomplete reaction intermediates in the reaction
      will lead to the purity of the target product is not high, and the
      byproduct of the reaction is cyclopropyl. The ketonic ketone is
      difficult to remove in the reaction of the late hydroxychloroquine
      side chain and 4,7-dichloroquinoline to synthesize
      hydroxychloroquine, thereby reducing the quality and clinical
      efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. Therefore, it is particularly
      necessary to carry out quality control during the synthesis of
      hydroxychloroquine side chains. After the experiment and research,
      the simultaneous determination of hydroxychloroquine side chain,
      its synthetic raw materials and the intermediates of ethylamine,
      ethylamine ethanol, ethylamine diethanolamine, chloropentanone,
      xylene, amino pentane and ethanol content were established. law.<br>

      hydroxychloroquine side chain, ethylamine, ethylamine ethanol,
      ethylamine diethanolamine, chloropentanone, xylene,
      aminopentanone, and ethanol to prepare a solution by dissolving
      N-methylpyrrolidone and carry out the headspace as described
      above. Samples were taken and assayed. The results showed (see
      Figure 1) that the retention times were 15.869 min for the
      hydroxychloroquine side chain, 2.531 min for ethylamine, 5.904 min
      for ethylamine ethanol, 11.613 min for ethylamine diethanolamine,
      7.691 min for chloropentanone, Xylene 6.399, 6.497, 6.841 min,
      aminopentanone 16.646 min, ethanol 2.662 min.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] (2)Linear<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The appropriate amount of hydroxychloroquine side chain was
      taken and diluted with N-methylpyrrolidone to form a series of
      standard solutions containing hydroxychloroquine side chains of
      1.0600, 3.2580, 7.6986, 19.246, 28.870, 72.174, 96.232, 120.29
      mg/mL, respectively. Determine the chromatographic conditions and
      determine the peak area (Y) for the linear regression of the
      concentration of the corresponding solvent (X, mg/mL). The linear
      relationship of the hydroxychloroquine side chain in the
      concentration range of 1.06 to 120.29mg/mL is good, and the
      regression equation is:<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Hydroxychloroquine side chain Y=304609X-887401 R2=0.9992<br>
      <br>
      [0051] (3)Precision<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Precisely take 2 mL of the test solution and dilute to 5 mL
      with solvent to obtain a solution containing 100 mg of
      hydroxychloroquine side chains per mL. Prepare 6 parts, according
      to the proposed chromatographic conditions, into the gas
      chromatograph, record the peak area. The relative standard
      deviation RSD was calculated to be 1.52%, in line with the
      requirements of the 2015 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] (4)Minimum detection limit<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The detection limit of the hydroxychloroquine side chain
      with S/N=3 was 0.2379 μg/mL.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Accuracy<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Take 2mL of the test solution and dilute to 5mL with
      solvent to obtain a solution containing 100mg of
      hydroxychloroquine side chains per mL. Six parts were prepared and
      injected into the gas chromatograph according to the above
      chromatographic conditions. Area normalization method was used to
      calculate the average content of 6 parts was 99.42%. Another
      precision weighing hydroxychloroquine side chain 0.60g plus
      appropriate amount of glacial acetic acid dissolved. Six parts
      were prepared and potentiometrically titrated with a 0.1%
      perchloric acid titrant to calculate the content, and the average
      content was calculated to be 98.97%. The hydroxychloroquine side
      chain stock solution was taken and diluted with
      N-methylpyrrolidone in three concentration gradients of 80%, 100%,
      and 120%. Each concentration was prepared in 3 portions for a
      total of 9 parts. According to the above chromatographic
      conditions, the sample was injected into the gas phase.

      effective, semi-continuous flow systems and methods for
      synthesizing hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). In particular, the
      invention provides a synthesis method that uses simple,
      inexpensive reagents to obtain the crucial intermediate
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one, vertical-integration
      of the starting material 5-iodopentan-2-one, and the integration
      of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Description of Related Art<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In 2016, an estimated 212 million cases of malaria,
      including 429,000 fatalities, were reported worldwide, with the
      majority of these cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and
      Southern Asia. The malaria epidemic is particularly difficult to
      control due to the multi-drug resistant nature of the malaria
      parasite Plasmodium falciparum.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Hydroxychloroquine (Figure 1A, HCQ) is an anti-malarial
      drug developed for both treatment and prevention of the disease in
      response to the widespread malaria resistance to chloroquine,
      (Figure IB, CQ). The World Health Organization has identified HCQ
      as an essential anti-malarial medication for a basic healthcare
      system. Additionally,<br>
      <br>
      [0011] hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an effective non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of various autoimmune
      diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (e.g. in cardiovascular
      patients), lupus, and childhood arthritis (or juvenile idiopathic
      arthritis) among others.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Unfortunately, global access to HCQ has been hindered by
      high manufacturing costs. Thus, the development of cost effective
      synthetic strategies to increase global access to this important
      global health drug is of great importance. The current HCQ
      commercial synthesis employs the key intermediate
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl) amino)pentan-2-one, 6, and its production
      is a major cost driver (see Figure 2A). An alternative route
      (Figure 2B) by Li and co-workers (2015) eliminates the
      protection-deprotection steps, but its use of a complex multi
      transition metal catalyst system to achieve direct SN 2
      substitution of the chlorine on 3 by the amine 7, is sub-optimal.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] There is a pressing need to develop new methods of
      synthesizing HCQ that are cost effective while producing the drug
      in high yield.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0014] SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0015] Other features and advantages of the present invention will
      be set forth in the description of invention that follows, and in
      part will be apparent from the description or may be learned by
      practice of the invention. The invention will be realized and
      attained by the compositions and methods particularly pointed out
      in the written description and claims hereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Provided herein is a cost effective semi-continuous flow
      method for the synthesis of the antimalarial drug HCQ. The
      synthesis involves the reaction of simple, inexpensive reagents to
      obtain crucial intermediates for the reaction, and overall employs
      a reduced number of synthesis steps while achieving a high, multi
      gram yield of the product. The synthetic strategy involves
      vertical-integration of the starting material 5-iodopentan-2-one
      and the integration of continuous stirred tank reactors for key
      steps of the method.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] It is an object of this invention to provide a method for
      synthesizing<br>
      <br>

      some aspects, steps i), ii) and iii) are conducted in a solvent
      that is the same for each step. In additional aspects, the solvent
      is tetrahydrofuran (THF). In other aspects, reacting step iv) is
      performed in an alcohol. In further aspects, the alcohol is
      ethanol. In yet further aspects, the base is K^CCL/EtsN. In other
      aspects, reacting step iv) proceeds for 6 hours. In additional
      aspects, the 5-iodopentan-2-one is formed by a) reacting a-acetyl
      butyrolactone with an iodine donor in an aqueous solvent. In yet
      further aspects, the method further comprises a step of b)
      extracting the 5-iodopentan-2-one from the aqueous solvent with an
      organic solvent. In additional aspects, the steps of a) reacting
      and b) extracting are performed in line in a first flow reactor.
      In other aspects, the first flow reactor is in line with the flow
      reactor of claim 1. In further aspects, the iodine donor is
      hydroiodic (HI) acid. In yet further aspects, the a-acetyl
      butyrolactone is neat. In additional aspects, the step of
      extracting is performed using a hydrophobic, membrane-based
      separator. In further aspects, the catalyst is a Raney nickel
      catalyst.<br>

      <b>[0035] DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0036] Provided herein is a highly efficient method for the
      semi-continuous synthesis of the antimalarial drug
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ). The method is“semi-continuous” because
      some steps of the method are conducted using continuous flow but
      others are conducted using continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTR)
      which are vertically integrated into the process. The method
      results in an overall yield improvement of about 52% over the
      current commercial HCQ production process, even though the methods
      use reactants that are simpler and less expensive than those
      employed in current commercial processes. A key feature in the new
      process is the elimination of protecting groups without invoking
      the use of expensive catalysts as required by Li (2015). The
      present high-yielding, multigram-scale semi-continuous synthesis
      thus provides an opportunity to achieve increased affordable
      global access to hydroxychloroquine for the prevention and
      treatment of malaria and various autoimmune diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The reactions of the continuous flow method are preferably
      carried out using the same solvent for several steps; however,
      this is not necessarily always the case. Those of skill in the art
      may choose to separate one or more of the optimized steps of the
      method and/or to use a different solvent or multiple solvents
      (e.g. rinsing the lines with the appropriate solvent prior to
      use), to make HCQ. Alternatively, one or more of the optimized
      reactions, either individually or in groups of several reactions,
      may be used for purposes other than making HCQ. For example, the
      starting materials and intermediates described herein are useful
      chemicals for a variety of purposes, and may be of interest in and
      of themselves, without further conversion. All such methods of
      making each chemical entity disclosed herein are encompassed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0038] DEFINITIONS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0039] Raney nickel catalyst: Raney nickel is a fine-grained solid
      composed mostly of nickel derived from a nickel-aluminum alloy.
      Several grades are known, but most are gray solids. Some are
      pyrophoric, most are used as air-stable slurries. The original
      form, Raney®-Nickel is a registered trademark of W. R. Grace and
      Company, but other generic forms are known and are also referred
      to generically as“Raney nickel” or as e.g. "skeletal catalyst" or<br>
      <br>
      [0040] "sponge-metal catalyst". These catalysts have properties
      similar to those of Raney®-Nickel. The catalyst may be a binary
      Ni-Al alloy and/or may comprise small amounts of a third metal (a
      "promoter") such as zinc or chromium, forming a ternary alloy. The
      third metal enhances the activity of the catalyst. All forms of
      this catalyst may be used in the methods described herein.
      Continuous stirred-tank reactors (CSTR), also known as vat- or
      backmix reactors, or continuous-flow stirred-tank reactors
      (CFSTR), are known in the art. CSTRs facilitate rapid dilution
      rates which make them resistant to both high pH and low pH
      fluctuations. It is sometimes economically beneficial to operate
      several CSTRs in series, e.g. for the same reaction, and this
      strategy may be implemented in the present methods. This allows,
      for example, the first CSTR to operate at a higher reagent
      concentration and therefore a higher reaction rate. In these
      cases, the sizes of the reactors may be varied in order to
      minimize the total capital investment required to implement the
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Room temperature generally refers to a temperature of from
      about 15 - 25 °C, and is generally about 20-22 °C.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0042] REACTIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0043] Synthesis of starting material (10)</b><br>
      <br>
      [0044] In the present synthesis, 5-iodopentan-2-one (10) replaces
      the traditional chlorinated starting material (3 in Figure 2).
      This iodinated starting material is made using a-acetyl
      butyrolactone 8 (used neat) via a decarboxylative ring-opening
      reaction, generally via reaction with an aqueous solution of an
      iodine donor (e.g. see Figure 4). Iodine donors that may be used
      include but are not limited to e.g. HI, FI, Nal, KI, Lil, etc. In
      some aspects, the iodine donor is HI in an aqueous solution. The
      amount of iodine donor (e.g. Hl) is typically at least about 20 to
      about 60%, and is generally at least about 40%, and is preferably
      at least about 50%, such as about 55%. The temperature of the
      reaction is generally at least about 40 °C or above, e.g. about
      40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85 or 90 °C, with about 80 °C
      being a preferred temperature. The reaction optimally proceeds for
      about 2.5 to about 15 minutes, e.g. about 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, or 15.0
      minutes or longer, with about 5-10 minutes being the preferred
      range, e.g. about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 minutes. The reaction
      pressure is generally from about 1.5 to 5.0 bar, e.g. about 1.5,
      2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5 or 5.0 bar, with about 3 bar being
      preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The reaction can optionally be monitored, e.g. by GC-MS, 'H
      NMR, etc. No intermediates are produced and the starting material
      is completely consumed during the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In preferred aspects, extraction and neutralization are
      accomplished in-line as part of a flow-based method as shown in
      Figure 5. An amphoteric compound which functions as a base (such
      as saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHC03 ) or Na3 C03 , (sodium
      carbonate), potassium carbonate (K2 CO3 ), etc.,) and one or more
      suitable organic solvents (e.g. hexanes and/or methyl tert- butyl
      ether, methylene chloride (DCM), ethyl acetate, etc.) are
      introduced in-line and are reacted with 5-iodopentan-2-one (10) in
      a reactor coil maintained at room temperature (e.g. about 25 °C).
      One or more hydrophobic, membrane-based separators receive the
      input from the reactor coil and it is used to produce an aqueous
      waste stream (comprising excess HI) and an organic stream
      comprising 10. Examples of suitable hydrophobic,<br>
      <br>
      [0047] membrane-based separators include but are not limited to:
      Zaiput, Versapore®, Zefluor™, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),
      polycarbonate membrane, etc. When a membrane-based separator is
      used, there is a loss of product to the water layer (e.g.
      generally 10% or less) but this is tolerated in order to avoid the
      need for complete batch workup steps.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In some aspects, 10 is then transferred (integrated)
      directly into a flow method, e.g. as the input to the next reactor
      coil, depicted in Figure 6. Alternatively, the reaction and
      separation may be done in batch in which crude 10 is extracted
      (generally at room<br>
      <br>
      [0049] temperature) e.g. with one or more hydrophobic solvents (as
      listed above), and neutralized e.g. to about pH = 7 using a base
      (as listed above). The combined organic phases are dried (e.g.
      using anhydrous sodium sulfate) and evaporated in vacuo to dryness
      to yield 10 for use in the first step of the semi-continuous
      synthesis method described in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0050] STEPS OF THE REACTION TO FORM HCQ</b><br>
      <br>
      [0051] Synthesis of 5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one
      (6):<br>
      <br>
      [0052] 5-iodopentan-2-one (10) formed as described above is used
      to synthesize<br>
      <br>
      [0053] 5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one (6) as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Compound 6 is synthesized from 10 in a flow reactor unit,
      preferably using a solvent system that is compatible with
      subsequent flow reactions of the method. In some aspects, the
      solvent is tetrahydrofuran (THF). However, other solvents such as
      1,4-dioxane, 2-methyl THF (tetrahydrofuran), MTBE (methyl
      tert-butyl ether), DCM (dichloromethane or methylene chloride),
      etc., may also be employed. Those of skill in the art will
      recognize the advantages of rinsing the flow reactor with dry
      solvent and/or flushing the system with an inert gas (e.g. N2 )
      prior to use.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] To perform the reaction, 10 is combined with
      2-(ethylamino)ethan-l-ol (7) in a suitable solvent, e.g. THF at
      about room temperature and streamed into a reactor coil, as
      depicted in Figure 6. The temperature in the coil is in the range
      of from about 70 to 90 °C, e.g. about 70, 95, 80, 85 or 90 °C, and
      the flow rate typically ranges from about 0.1 to about 1.0 ml/min,
      e.g. about 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 or 1.0
      ml/min or higher, for larger coils.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The reaction is then quenched by passing the reaction
      mixture e.g. through a packed bed reactor containing e.g.
      potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lithium carbonate, lithium
      hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, or other suitable material. The
      temperature in the packed bed reactor is generally about 85 - 100
      °C, such as about 85, 90, 95 or 100 °C. This yields product 6,
      which is transferred directly to the next in-line step.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Alternatively, the output of the reaction between 10 and 7
      is collected and quenched, extracted with one or more organic
      solvents (e.g. DCM) and the combined organic layers are dried over
      sodium sulfate, and evaporated to give 6, which can be used in
      further reactions. Synthesis of
      (E)-5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one oxime (11)<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Compound 6 is ultimately converted to
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2- aminopentane 12 via intermediate
      oxime 11. Briefly, a simple conversion of the ketone group of 6
      yields oxime 11, which is then reduced to give 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] A. Synthesis of oxime 11<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The conversion of 6 to oxime 1 1 is preferably done in-line
      as part of a continuous flow synthesis method, as shown in Figure
      6. 6 is combined with an agent such as NfTOFl (e.g. about 0.5, 1.0
      or 1.5 M). This reaction is generally performed in a reactor coil
      (e.g. at about 0.5, 1.0 or 1.5 mF/min, such as about 1.0 mF/min)
      at a temperature of from about 80 to 100 °C, e.g. about 80, 85,
      90, 95 or 100 °C, and with a tR of about 15-30 minutes, e.g. about
      15,<br>
      <br>
      [0061] 20, 25, or 30 minutes such as about 20 min. The reaction is
      quenched e.g. by passage through a packed bed reactor comprising a
      compound such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lithium
      carbonate, lithium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, etc. The
      temperature in the packed bed reactor is generally about 85 - 100
      °C, such as about 85, 90, 95 or 100 °C. This yields oxime 11. If
      needed, 11 is e.g. concentrated, taken up in a solvent such as
      DCM, etc. prior to the next reaction. However, further
      purification is generally not needed and 11 may pass directly to
      the next step.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Synthesis of 5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-aminopentane
      (12)<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The next to last step of the production of HCQ is the
      conversion of oxime 11 to
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-aminopentane (12). Accordingly,
      product 11 is passed to the next reaction, which takes place in a
      continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). 11 is efficiently reduced
      to 12 in a CSTR using a suitable solvent (e.g. THF, diglyme,
      1,4-dioxane, methanol, ethanol, 2-methyl THF, IPA (2-propanol)),
      etc. Significantly, the reaction proceeds in the presence of a
      Raney Nickel catalyst, which is retained or sequestered in the
      CSTR. The reaction mixture comprises compound 11 at a
      concentration ranging from about 0.05-2.0 M (such as about 0.05.
      0.1. 0.2. 0.3. 0.4. 0.5. 0.6, 0.7. 0.8. 0.9, 1.0. 1.1 , 1.2. 1.3.
      1.4. 1.5. 1.6. 1.7, 1 .8. 1.9. or 2.0. in a suitable solvent. The
      solvent is preferably the same as that which is used in the prev
      ious How steps, such as THF or diglyme, 1 ,4-dioxane, methanol,
      ethanol, 2-methyl THF, IPA. etc. However, this is not strictly
      necessary and methods w hich use other solvents for one or more
      steps of the method are also encompassed. The reaction mixture is
      generally introduced into the reaction vessel at a set Ho rate of
      e.g. 0.6-2.5 mL min1 such as about 0.6, 1 .0, 1.5, 2.0 or 2.5 mL
      min1 . The reaction pressure is typically set to about 5- 15 bar.
      such as about 10 bar with an inert gas such as hydrogen supplied
      at a suitable How rate (e.g. 0.1 to 1 .0 mL min 1 , such as about
      0.5 mL min1 ). The reaction takes place at a temperature in the
      range of from about 70 to about 90 °C. e.g. about 70, 75. 80, 85
      or 90 °C. such as about 80 C. The reaction generally proceeds w
      ith agitation e.g. stirring (e.g. at about 500 to 100 rpm. such as
      about 750 rpm) to provide proper mixing. The reaction volume may
      be monitored and hen suitable (e.g. hen a difference between two
      thermocouples is detected, such as about a 1. 2, 3. 4. or 5 °C
      difference, such as a 3°C difference) a level control opens allow
      ing products to exit the reactor. Conversely, when the temperature
      difference between the two thermocouples is greater than e.g.
      about 1. 2. 3. 4, or 5 °C. such as 3°C. reactants enter the tank.
      Product is collected e.g. when a steady-state is reached. The

      [0065] Synthesis of hydroxychloroquine (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The final step in the synthesis of HCQ involves the
      reaction of 12 with 4,7,-dichloroquinoline, 13. This step is also
      performed in a CSTR, and the reactions take place in an alcohol
      solvent, preferably ethanol. However, in some aspects, other
      alcohols such as methanol, n-butanol, isopropanol, etc. may be
      employed. The reactants are 12 plus a suitable base, e.g. NaOH,
      KOH, K2 CO3 , ET3 N, D1PEA (N,N-Diisopropylethylamine), or
      combinations thereof, especially combinations with ET3 N such as
      NaOH/ETiN, DIPEA/ET3 N or K2 CO3 /ET3 N. In preferred aspects, K2
      C03 /Et3 N is used. This step is advantageously accelerated
      (compared to conventional methods) by employing K2 CC&gt;3 /Et3 N.
      As a result, a high yield of HCQ is obtained, e.g. in less than
      about 6 hours of reaction time.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Reactants, 13 and 12 are combined in approximately a 1/1
      molar ratio (e.g. about 1/1.2 molar ratio, respectively) with
      equal equivalents of Et3N and K2 CO3 . The amount of each of Et3 N
      and K2 C03 is generally about half that that of reactant 13,
      mole/mole. The reactants are combined in sufficient solvent e.g.
      ethanol to allow thorough mixing. The reaction is allowed to
      proceed in an inert atmosphere (e.g. under N2 ) at a temperature
      of about 100 to 150 °C, e.g. at about 100, 105, 1 10, 1 15, 120,
      125, 130, 135, 140, 145 or 150 °C, such as about 125 °C, and
      requires about 6 hours for completion.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Following completion of the reaction, ethanol is removed
      (e.g. via distillation) and the product is recovered e.g. by
      extraction, separation, drying, etc. as needed to afford the final
      product.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] SYSTEMS<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Also provided are systems for synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) . The systems are semi-continuous flow
      systems and comprise elements/components that are in-line, flow
      components and also CSTRs. For example, the systems generally
      comprise a plurality of reaction coils (also referred to herein
      as“reactor coils”), e.g. generally 3 or 4, which may or may not be
      heated, depending on the reaction(s) that take place within a
      coil. The systems also generally comprise a plurality of packed
      bed reactors. In addition, various lines, valves, connectors,
      separators, reservoirs (e.g. to serve as sources of a reactant),
      etc. are included in the system, and the system components are
      advantageously operably linked in-line. That is to say, generally
      a product, such as a reactant, that is produced in one component
      of the system is transferred directly to a component in which it
      undergoes a further reaction, without intervening steps of
      purification (other than e.g. steps of phase separation,
      neutralization, etc. which can also be done in-line).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In some aspects, the systems comprise a first heated
      reactor coil that is configured to (i.e. comprises a least one
      inlet to) receive 5-iodopentan-2-one and 2-(ethylamino)ethan-l-ol,
      and an outlet to output
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one, usually directly into
      a first packed bed reactor. The first packed bed reactor typically
      comprises a neutralizing agent and is configured to include an
      inlet to receive input from first heated reactor coil, typically
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one. The
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino) pentan-2-one flows through the
      first packed bed reactor, is neutralized, and is then passed
      directly to a second heated reactor coil configured to (having at
      least one inlet to) receive neutralized
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one from the first packed
      bed reactor. The second heated coil is also configured to receive
      hydroxylamine, and a reaction takes place in the second heated
      coil to form (E)-5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one oxime.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The oxime is output from the second heated reaction coil to
      a second packed bed reactor, which like the first packed bed
      reactor, comprises a neutralizing agent. The neutralizing agents
      in the first and second packed bed reactors may be the same or
      different. The second packed bed reactor comprises an inlet to
      receive 5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one oxime from the
      second heated reactor coil and and outlet to output neutralized<br>
      <br>
      [0073] (E)-5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)pentan-2-one oxime.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The systems disclosed herein also comprise one or more
      continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) which comprise a stirring
      mechanism. For example, a first CSTR is generally configured to
      contain a Raney nickel catalyst, receive neutralized<br>
      <br>
      [0075] (E)-5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino) pentan-2-one oxime from
      the second packed bed reactor, and output
      5-(ethyI(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2- aminopentane. This CSTR
      generally also comprises an inlet for a gas, e.g. an iert gas such
      as FT. Typically the output of the first CSTR is received by a
      second CSTR. The second CSTR receives both<br>
      <br>
      [0076] 5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-aminopentane (from the
      first CSTR) and<br>
      <br>
      [0077] 4,7,-dichloroquinoline (from a source of
      4,7,-dichloroquinoline). The reaction between these two chemicals
      within the second CSTR produces HCQ, which can subsequently be
      output from the second CSTR for further processing, if needed
      (e.g. via extraction, purification, concentration, drying, etc.
      Further processing generally also includes forming the HCQ into
      dosage forms, e.g. tablets, liquid dosage forms, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Is some aspects, the 5-iodopentan-2-one that is input into
      the first reaction coil is transferred from another in-line flow
      system, which may be integrated directly into the system described
      above, or may be a stand-alone system. This second system
      comprises at least a heated reaction coil configured to receive
      a-acetyl butyrolactone and an iodine donor. The reaction that
      takes place in the heated reaction coil produces
      5-iodopentan-2-one, which is then output to a reaction coil
      configured to receive the 5-iodopentan-2-one from the heated
      reaction coil, and also to receive a base. The reaction coil may
      or may not be heated because the reaction takes place, e.g. at
      room temperature (rt). However, in some aspects, heating may be
      required to maintain the reaction coil at a consistent
      temperature, e.g. at or near rt. This segment of the overall
      system further comprises at least one hydrophobic, membrane-based
      separator with an inlet to receive 5-iodopentan-2-one from the rt
      reaction coil. The hydrophobic, membrane-based separator extracts
      5-iodopentan-2-one into an organic solvent, and outputs the
      5-iodopentan-2-one in an organic phase via a suitable outlet. In
      some aspects, the 5-iodopentan-2-one is transferred directly
      in-line into the first heated reactor coil described above, e.g.
      without intervening steps of collection, purification, etc. In
      other aspects, the 5-iodopentan-2-one is collected and processed
      as needed, before being provided as the starting material in the
      semi-continuous system described above, e.g. before being input
      into the first reaction coil.<br>

      [0079] A schematic, non-limiting representation of an exemplary
      semi-continuous flow system is shown in Figure 9. Depicted are
      multiple reaction coils 110, 111, 112 and 113; multiple reservoirs

      from which waste passes through waste line 135 to waste container
      136, multiple bed reactors 140 and 141, two CSTRs 150 and 151, and

      <br>
      [0096] EXAMPLE<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The continuous synthesis described herein involves a
      retrosynthetic process (Figure 3) in which 10, an iodo analogue to
      starting material 3, is generated in a single step via a
      decarboxylative ring-opening of a-acetyl butyrolactone 8. The
      iodo-analogue, 10, is then used without isolation to prepare
      compound 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] A direct one-step reductive animation of 6 to give 12 can
      be accomplished by simple heterogeneous reduction with H2
      /Raney-Nickel. However, THF is employed in all of the prior flow
      steps and is a poor choice as a solvent for the reductive
      amination step due to limited solubility of ammonia in THF.
      H2/Raney-Nickel reductions are often carried out in alcoholic
      media where much higher concentrations of ammonia are achievable
      but would require a solvent exchange. There are many reports of
      continuous flow chemistry methods for reductive amination of
      ketones [25-31]; however, such processes typically require soluble
      reductants such as diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL-H),
      superhydrides, or supported borohydride species [32-36] Although
      these approaches are effective, they are significantly more costly
      than using simple heterogeneous reduction with H2/Raney-Nickel.
      Therefore, we explored an alternate strategy: first, simple
      conversion of the ketone group of 6 to oxime 11, which is then
      followed by reduction with H2 /Raney-Nickel to give
      5-(ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)- 2-aminopentane 12. This
      efficiently reduces 11 to 12 with THF as the solvent in a
      continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR).<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The last step of HCQ synthesis requires reaction of 12 with
      4,7,-dichloroquinoline, 13, which when used neat takes 24-48 hours
      at 120-140°C to give 75-80% yield of HCQ, 1 [37]. We have found
      that this step can be accelerated by employing K2 C03/
      triethylamine, to facilitate the formation of HCQ, 1, resulting in
      a comparable yield in less than 6 hours. Thus, we have integrated
      the continuous preparation of reaction with a new efficient
      continuous flow synthesis of 12 with the final step by using a
      CSTR to accommodate the longer reaction time required to produce
      HCQ. Initial optimization efforts to prepare 6 revealed poor
      reactivity of starting material 3, so we pursued the iodo-analogue
      of 3, 5-iodopentan-2-one (10) as an alternative. By optimizing the
      reaction concentration, we have also shown that 10 reacts rapidly
      and cleanly with 7 under flow conditions to give 6 in high-yield
      (&gt;80%). Furthermore, we have developed and optimized a
      continuous synthesis of 10 (Table 1, (Figure 4), wherein
      hydroiodic acid is reacted with neat
      3-acetyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one, 8, to provide a rapid route to 10
      which is significantly higher in yield than previously reported
      syntheses [38-39] Initial results using diluted hydroiodic acid
      (20-40%) provided only modest conversion to product over a range
      of temperatures (Table 1, entries 1-5); however, use of 55%
      hydroiodic acid (Table 1, entries 6-8) was found to give near
      quantitative conversion. The reaction profile was monitored using
      GC-MS and 'H NMR - no intermediates were observed under these
      conditions. Optimization of the flow rate with 55% hydroiodic acid
      (Table 1, entries 6-8) revealed that a flow rate of 1.0 ml min1
      (/«= 5 min) gave an isolated yield of 89%.<br>

      [0112] Due to the need to use an excess of hydroiodic acid it is
      important to remove its excess from the eluting reaction stream
      before telescoping into the next step in flow. The product stream
      containing crude 10 was mixed in-line with methyl-tertbutylether
      (MTBE) and saturated NaHCC&gt;3 before phase separation using a
      hydrophobic, membrane-based separator (Zaiput) [40] (Scheme 3) to
      afford purified 10 in the organic phase. A loss of 5-10% of
      product to the water layer was observed, however this was deemed
      adequate as it prevented the need for a complete workup step in
      batch.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] In the next step, 6 was reacted with hydroxylamine, which
      was facilitated by passing through a packed-bed of K2 CO3 to give
      oxime 11 (Table 2). As was seen with the reaction to produce 6
      (Table 1) reactant concentrations also had a dramatic effect on
      oxime formation. A series of experiments were conducted to
      optimize the continuous formation of 11. Reaction yields were
      modest at lower reactant concentrations across several
      temperatures and residence times (Table 2). Conversion to 11
      increased when reactant concentrations were increased (9% at 0.1 M
      to 72% at 1 M) (Table 2, entries 1-6). Optimization of the flow
      rate with 1 M concentrations of each reactant (Table 2, entries
      6-8) showed that a flow rate of 1.0 ml min1 (/«= 20 min) was
      optimal, giving an isolated yield of 78% (Table 2, entry 7).<br>

      [0124] The reductive amination of 11 performed in the first
      generation batch process was carried out using Raney Nickel at 80
      °C, 10 bar hydrogen pressure for 4-6h [21-24]. In order to perform
      this step in a continuous fashion, a continuous stirred tank
      reactor [25, 41] was employed (Table 3). Materials were delivered
      to the CSTR vessel through an HPLC pump and reacted under hydrogen
      pressure with mechanical stirring. The dip tube in the CSTR was
      outfitted with a fritted metal filter, allowing for retention of
      the heterogeneous catalyst within the CSTR vessel. Optimization of
      this CSTR-based flow process (Table 3) showed near quantitative
      yields of 12 over a broad range of oxime 11 reactant
      concentrations. An optimum residence time was determined to be
      hours.<br>

      [0131] After optimizing the individual steps up to compound 12 the
      entire reaction was telescoped into a continuous reaction process
      that converts 10 and 6 into 12 (Figure 8) with an overall isolated
      yield of 68% for compound 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] With an optimized continuous process for producing the key
      intermediate 12, in-hand, reaction conditions for the conversion
      of 12 to HCQ were examined. In the commercial process this step is
      carried in batch under neat reactant conditions and requires a
      relatively long reaction time of 24-48h [42-44] In order to
      convert this step to a flow chemistry method, we employed a CSTR
      (Table 4). This final step, transforming 12 and 13 into 1, was
      first investigated in batch to optimize the conditions when
      implemented in an CSTR.<br>

      [0144] Process optimization for the final step began by screening
      the effect of solvent and base(s) on HCQ yield. Screening of
      different polar-protic and non-protic solvents (see Table S-2 in
      SI) [45] demonstrated that ethanol is most effective for this
      transformation. During the screening of bases, the pKa of the
      amine and alcohol groups present in compound 12 were given careful
      consideration in order to minimize C-0 bond formation (Table 4).
      NaOH or KOH in ethanol gave low (&lt;40%) conversion, whereas
      using K2 C03 in ethanol gave 82% conversion to HCQ (Table 4, Entry
      3). Attempts with organic bases (Entries 5-6) resulted in only
      moderate conversions to the desired product; however, using a 1 :1
      mixture of K2 C03 /Et3 N (1/1) in ethanol resulted in 88%
      conversion (Table 4, Entry 6) to 1, with corresponds to an
      isolated yield of 78%.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Conclusion<br>
      <br>
      [0146] In summary, we have developed a high-yielding continuous
      flow process for the synthesis of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) by
      optimizing continuous flow methods for the synthesis of key
      intermediates 6 and 12. Additionally we have developed and
      optimized flow chemistry conditions for performing reductive
      animation of 1 1 using Raney-Nickel as catalyst in a continuous
      stirring tank reactor (CSTR) for the synthesis of compound 12, and
      have incorporated it into a fully continuous telescoped process
      for synthesis of 12 from lactone 8 and aminoethanol 7. Feeding the
      output stream containing 12 from the above CSTR into a second CSTR
      in which 12 is converted to HCQ provides a completely continuous
      flow process from producing HCQ from readily available starting
      materials. This efficient process has the potential to increase
      global access to this strategically important antimalarial drug.

      mL. The reaction vessel was first charged with Raney Nickel ( I
      .Og). The Raney Nickel catalyst was retained in the CSTR by the 2
      pm metal filter frit on the diptube of the exit stream. The
      reaction mixture, consisting of compound 11 (0.05-2.0 M) in THF,
      was pumped by an HPLC pump set at a flow rate of 0.6-2.5 mLmin1
      into the reaction vessel. The reaction pressure was set to 10 bar
      of hydrogen supplied by hydrogen gas (ultra high purity) at a flow
      rate of 0.5 mLmin1 . The reaction temperature was set to SO which
      was controlled by a thermocouple positioned in the reaction
      mixture. The reaction was stirred with mechanical stirring (750
      rpm) to provide proper mixing. Two thermocouples were used to
      control the reaction volume in the reactor by setting a level
      control of -3°C. The lower thermocouple constantly measured and
      controlled the reaction temperature and the upper thermocouple
      measured the temperature at approximately 150 mL reactor volume.
      When the two thermocouples were w ithin 3°C, the level control
      Opened" the exit stream diptube to allow products to exit the
      reactor, or closed' the exit stream diptube to allow the reactor
      to fill when the temperature difference between the two
      thermocouples was greater than 3°C. Product was collected after a
      full reaction volume of material ( 150 mL) had passed through the
      CSTR indicating that steady-state was reached. The reaction was
      monitored by liquid chromatography and 'H NMR. The reaction
      mixture was filtered through a celite pad and dried under reduced
      pressure. The solution was extracted with water (10 mL) and
      dichloromethane (3 x 20 mL). The organic layers were combined,

        Abstract</b><br>
      The invention discloses an asymmetric synthesis method of
      optically pure (R)/(S)-hydroxychloroquine.
      4-amino-7-chloroquinoline and 5- ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)
      amine-2-pentanone are taken as starting raw materials and are
      subjected to an asymmetric reductive ammoniation reaction under
      the catalysis of chiral acid, optically pure hydroxychloroquine is
      obtained, and the spatial configuration of a product is controlled
      through spatial configuration of the chiral acid. The method
      adopts simple steps, the raw materials are easy to obtain, the
      yield is higher, the stereoselectivity is good, the operation is
      simple, the chiral construction cost is relatively lower, and the
      method is suitable for large-scale production.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] Technical field<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention belongs to the field of drug synthesis and
      organic synthesis, and relates to an asymmetric synthesis method
      of optically pure (R)/(S)-hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Background technique<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Hydroxychloroquine, chemical name
      2-[[4-[(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)amino]pentyl]ethylamino]-ethanol,
      has a chiral carbon center with (-)- (R)-Hydroxychloroquine and
      (+)-(S)-hydroxychloroquine are two optical isomers belonging to
      4-aminoquinoline. The clinical use is (R)/(S) two optical isomers.
      The mixture is mixed in equal proportions, that is, the racemic
      compound is administered. It was first used in the treatment of
      antimalarial, hydroxychloroquine phosphate and sulfate are now
      widely used in the clinical treatment of discoid lupus
      erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus; in addition,
      hydroxychloroquine also has applications in immunosuppression and
      anti-inflammatory reactions. .<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Recent studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine is also
      expected to develop into a new class of anti-diabetic drugs. In a
      clinical trial, 32 healthy subjects, in a double-blind, randomized
      trial of up to 14 weeks, showed that hydroxychloroquine can
      effectively increase insulin sensitivity, increase beta-cell
      viability, and regulate sugar Metabolism, which in turn lowers the
      level of HbA1c, is expected to be developed as a drug for diabetes
      prevention.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] At the same time, studies on hydroxychloroquine metabolism
      in humans showed significant differences in the absorption,
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of
      (-)-(R)-hydroxychloroquine and (+)-(S)-hydroxychloroquine. The
      plasma protein binding rate of (-)-(R)-hydroxychloroquine was 37%,
      and the plasma protein binding rate of (+)-(S)-hydroxychloroquine
      was 64%; when the racemic compound was administered, (-) The blood
      concentration of -(R)-hydroxychloroquine is always higher than
      (+)-(S)-hydroxychloroquine, and the ratio is different in animals
      and humans. In addition, the metabolic constants of the optical
      isomers have different half-life, peak time, and drug-time curve
      area. More critically, the renal clearance rate of
      (-)-(R)-hydroxychloroquine was only about 40% of
      (+)-(S)-hydroxychloroquine. The enormous physiological and
      biochemical properties of the two isomers in the human body
      prompted a deeper study of the differences between
      (R)/(S)-hydroxychloroquine; at the same time, according to the
      national new drug declaration requirements, different optical
      isomers should be Treat according to different chemical entities.
      Therefore, the development of a new optical pure
      hydroxychloroquine synthesis method has a positive significance
      for the application of this class of drugs in new fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The chemical synthesis of hydroxychloroquine has been
      studied earlier and the route is mature, but it is limited to the
      synthesis of racemates, and there are few synthetic methods for
      (R) or (S)-hydroxychloroquine. Using
      5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine)-2-pentylamine as starting
      material, multiple resolution and recrystallization of
      (+)-(S)-mandelic acid can be obtained. (R) and
      (S)-5-(N-ethyl-N-2-hydroxyethylamine)-2-pentylamine in 55% yield;
      then reacted with 4,7-dichloroquinoline to give hydroxy
      Chloroquine. The synthetic method has a complicated route and
      complicated operation. Therefore, the synthesis and synthesis of
      new optically pure hydroxychloroquine is not only a requirement of
      medicinal chemistry, but also a requirement of organic chemistry.<br>

      temperature (10 to 30 minutes, the solution is clarified or
      uniformly suspended) to obtain a mixture A, and 4-amino-7- is
      added to the mixture A. Chloroquinoline and
      5-ethyl(2-hydroxyethyl)amine-2-pentanone (known chemical CAS:

      <br>
      [0012] 2)Saturated brine was added to the mixture B, extracted
      with ethyl acetate, and then purified by column chromatography.<br>
      <br>

      consisting of an alkali metal borohydride, a cyano or triacetoxy
      substituent of the alkali metal borohydride, a borane, a borane
      trimethylamine complex or a tetrabutylcyano boron. Ammonium

        Abstract</b><br>
      The invention discloses a structural formula of hydroxychloroquine
      linolenate and also provides a method for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine linolenate. The method comprises the following
      steps: preparing hydroxychloroquine from hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate and a sodium hydroxide liquid, and purifying by adding
      ethyl acetate; adding an organic solvent, a catalyst and a
      dewatering agent in linolenic acid, then adding the prepared
      hydroxychloroquine to carry out constant-temperature reaction for
      12-24 hours, wherein the mole equivalence ratio of linolenic acid
      to hydroxychloroquine is (1:1)-(1:1.5); and finally, carrying out
      column chromatography separation to obtain high-purity
      hydroxychloroquine linolenate. After lots of hydroxychloroquine
      linolenate is absorbed by tumor cells, hydroxychloroquine
      linolenate is metabolized to form hydroxychloroquine, thereby
      increasing the concentration of focus medicine and reducing
      medicine dose.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] Technical field<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention relates to hydroxychloroquinelinone
      and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Background technique<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline derivative which
      is commonly used clinically. Hydroxychloroquine is a traditional
      antimalarial drug used to control the clinical symptoms of malaria
      and the preventive prevention of malaria, rheumatoid arthritis,
      juvenile chronic arthritis, discoid and systemic lupus
      erythematosus, and skin lesions caused or exacerbated by sunlight.
      . Studies in recent years have shown that hydroxychloroquine has a
      good inhibitory effect on a variety of malignant tumors.
      Hydroxychloroquine inhibits the growth of human breast cancer
      cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and regulates the protein acetylation
      process of tumor cell MCF-7. Hydroxychloroquine also inhibits the
      activity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by inducing
      apoptosis in cells by activating caspase-3 and regulating the
      ratio of BCL-2 to Bax. Hydroxychloroquine also increases lysosomal
      and mitochondrial permeability, thereby inducing apoptosis. As an
      autophagy inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine inhibits the growth of
      tumor cells by inhibiting the autophagy of tumor cells, destroying
      the metabolism of tumor cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids in tumor cells is
      much higher than that in normal cells. As an unsaturated fatty
      acid, alpha linolenic acid can be efficiently taken up by tumor
      tissues. Comprehensive application of the principle of tumor
      targeting prodrug design and the principle of structural splicing,
      designing and synthesizing prodrugs is a method for the synthesis
      of new drugs. The present invention synthesizes a prodrug of
      hydroxychloroquine (hydroxyl) by structural modification of
      hydroxychloroquine. Chloroquine linoleate), which utilizes the
      property of linolenic acid to be efficiently taken up by tumor
      cells, is loaded with an antitumor drug such as hydroxychloroquine
      to increase the drug concentration of the target site of the drug
      molecule, thereby achieving the purpose of improving the antitumor
      efficiency of the drug.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In order to solve the above-mentioned deficiencies in the
      prior art, the present invention proposes a new solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Summary of the invention<br>
      <br>
      [0008] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
      tumor-targeted prodrug: hydroxychloroquinolinate which, after in
      vivo metabolism, can be a drug which reduces the amount of a drug,
      reduces toxicity, and enhances antitumor activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] At the same time, the present invention also provides a
      process for preparing hydroxychloroquine linolenate.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In order to achieve the above object, the technical
      solution adopted by the present invention is:<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The invention has the structure of the
      hydroxychloroquinolinate prepared by using hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate and linolenic acid as raw materials, and the structural
      formula is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0012]<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The synthetic route is:<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The preparation process includes:<br>
      <br>
      [0016] 1、Hydroxychloroquine is prepared by using
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate and sodium hydroxide solution, wherein
      the molar ratio of hydroxychloroquine sulfate to sodium hydroxide
      solution is 1:3, and then ethyl acetate is added for purification;<br>
      <br>
      [0017] 2、The linolenic acid is mixed with an organic solvent, a
      catalyst and a dehydrating agent, and stirred under nitrogen for 5
      minutes to 1 hour, and then heated to normal temperature; then the
      prepared hydroxychloroquine is added, and the reaction is carried
      out at room temperature for 12~. 24 hours, wherein the molar
      equivalent ratio of linolenic acid and hydroxychloroquine is 1:1
      to 1:1.5;<br>
      <br>
      [0018] 3、After the reaction is stopped, the organic solvent is
      added, and the solution is heated to 50 ° C, and washed with a
      hydrochloric acid solution, a saturated sodium chloride solution
      and water, and the organic phase is washed with anhydrous sodium
      sulfate and concentrated to give a brownish oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The oil is dissolved in methyl tert-butyl ether, and the
      solution is washed with hydrochloric acid solution. The oil phase
      is separated and dissolved in methanol. The activated carbon is
      decolorized and concentrated to give a yellow oil. The yellow oil
      is separated by column chromatography. After elution separation,
      it was concentrated again and dried to give hydroxychloroquinoline
      linoleate.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Linolenic acid requires the addition of an organic solvent,
      a catalyst and a dehydrating agent before it is reacted with
      hydroxychloroquine. Wherein the organic solvent is selected from
      the group consisting of chloroform, dichloromethane or ethyl
      acetate; the catalyst is selected from the group consisting of
      4-dimethylaminopyridine, 4-methylmorpholine, triethylamine,
      pyridine or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole; the dehydrating agent is
      selected from Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,
      N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide or
      1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In the preparation of hydroxychloroquinelinone, when the
      mixture is subjected to column chromatography, it is necessary to
      select a suitable stationary phase and eluent. According to the
      physicochemical properties and experimental demonstration of
      hydroxychloroquinolinone, the stationary phase selected by the
      present invention is silica gel, wherein the silica gel column
      chromatography with 200-300 mesh has good effect, and the silica
      gel with 200 mesh is optimized. The eluent for column
      chromatography is chloroform-methanol or dichloromethane-methanol,
      and dichloromethane-methanol is optimally selected.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The hydroxychloroquinolinone prepared by the present
      invention is a novel compound which can be used to prepare an
      antitumor drug according to the principle of a prodrug.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In summary, the present invention has the following
      advantages:<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Hydroxychloroquinelinone is a conjugate of
      hydroxychloroquine and linolenic acid through an ester bond. As a
      prodrug, hydroxychloroquinolinone in the body can be more
      effectively concentrated in the tumor site under the action of

      developed by Winthrop. It was originally used for malaria
      treatment. It was used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus in
      1955. It was first introduced in the United States in 1956, and
      then successively in Japan, France, Denmark, Finland, Germany,
      etc. National and regional listings. In 1998, the US FDA approved
      hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and
      lupus erythematosus. Compared with other similar drugs, it has an
      advantage in safety, not only can improve the symptoms of
      arthritis in patients, but also anti-oxidation and anti-lipid,

      reaction uses phenol as a solvent, the phenol is highly toxic and
      corrosive, and is extremely harmful to people and the environment,
      and is converted into an aqueous solution of sodium phenolate to
      form harmful phenol-containing wastewater in the post-treatment
      process. Increased the difficulty of the three waste treatment;
      ii) the condensation reaction time is 18h, the long-term reaction
      will not only increase the production cost, but also lead to the
      increase of the content and quantity of impurities, especially the
      long-term high temperature reaction, which will increase the
      deethylated impurities. Produced, and this impurity is difficult
      to remove; iii) use of phosphoric acid to remove impurities during
      the reaction, resulting in the production of a large amount of
      phosphorus-containing wastewater, further increasing environmental
      pressure; iv) extraction solvent chloroform is a type of solvent,
      carcinogenic, environmentally unfriendly; v) Recrystallization
      solvent Ether is flammable and explosive, and has a high safety
      hazard; vi) The procedure is long, the operation is cumbersome,
      and the total yield is very low, only 18.6%.<br>

      [0016] The reaction time is too long (45-50h), and the energy
      consumption is large, which not only increases the production
      cost, but also increases the generation of impurities, which is
      not conducive to industrial production; in the post-treatment
      process, the product is firstly made into phosphate and then
      alkalized with ammonium hydroxide. The product is freed, extracted
      with dichloromethane, the operation is cumbersome, and a large
      amount of phosphorus-containing wastewater is generated, which
      increases the pressure of “waste water” treatment; in particular,

      concentration, column, fractionation, etc. to obtain the product,
      many steps, complicated operation, low yield (only 45.9%); the
      final product passed Column chromatography and fractional

      solvent is difficult to recycle, and the wastewater is greatly
      affected. The environmental protection pressure; the route is long
      and complicated, the operation is cumbersome; the raw materials
      are expensive and the cost is high.<br>

      [0003] Background technique<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate (HCQ) is chemically known as
      2-[[4-[(7-chloro-4-quinolinyl)amino]pentyl]ethylamino]-ethanol
      sulfate, CAS No. 747-36- 4. The chemical structure is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0005]<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was successfully developed by
      Winthrop and first listed in the United States in 1956. It was
      later listed in France, Denmark, Japan, Germany, Finland and other
      countries and regions. On May 29, 1998, the US FDA approved
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for the treatment of lupus
      erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] US 2,546,658 discloses a process for the synthesis of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the process of which is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The patent was published in 1951, the process is relatively
      backward, the use of phenol as a solvent, phenol pollution is
      large, phenol-containing wastewater is a kind of pollution in
      industrial wastewater, and phenol is solid at room temperature,
      must be heated into liquid to produce, The operation is
      cumbersome, the recovery is difficult, the post-processing
      difficulty is increased, the yield is low, less than 20%, and the
      product is difficult to handle, and is not suitable for industrial
      production.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] CA2561987 discloses a process for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the reaction process of which is as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0011]<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The method comprises the steps of sequentially adding
      isopropanol, hydroxychloroquine side chain, 4,7-dichloroquinoline,
      stirring, slowly heating, slowly distilling off isopropanol,
      stirring at 120-130 ° C for 20-24 h, then cooling to 70-80 Add
      water and methyl isobutyl ketone, adjust the pH to above 10,
      separate the liquid, add acetic anhydride at room temperature and
      stir overnight, then add lithium hydroxide monohydrate, water and
      methanol, stir again at room temperature overnight, and wash the
      organic phase again with water. Once, methanol and sulfuric acid
      are added to the organic phase, and the mixture is filtered with
      salt to obtain crude hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The crude product
      is added to water and methyl isobutyl ketone, stirred and
      dissolved, and the pH is adjusted to 10-11 by adding sodium
      hydroxide. The liquid phase is separated, and the organic phase is
      washed with brine, decolorized by adding activated carbon,
      filtered, and the filtrate is evaporated to obtain
      hydroxychloroquine free base, and salt is formed with concentrated
      sulfuric acid in an anhydrous alcohol to obtain a
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate product. The purification process of
      the method is cumbersome, the route is long, the waste water and
      the waste solid amount are large, and it takes two steps to form
      salt, which takes a long time and is not suitable for process
      production.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] WO2010027150 discloses a method for synthesizing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, the reaction route of which is as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0014]<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The method comprises adding 4,7-dichloroquinoline, a
      hydroxychloroquine side chain to an autoclave, pressurizing with
      nitrogen or argon to 5-20 bar, and reacting at 100-120 ° C for 4-6
      hours. After the reaction was completed, hydrochloric acid was
      added to adjust the acidity, and impurities were extracted by
      chloroform extraction. The aqueous phase was adjusted with alkali
      and then extracted with chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated,
      crystallised from dichloroethane, and concentrated sulfuric acid
      was added under anhydrous ethanol to obtain hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate. The reaction involves high pressure, and there are
      certain safety hazards. The alkalization loss is large after
      acidification first, and chloroform is a second type solvent.
      Dichloroethane is a kind of solvent and should be controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] CN103724261A discloses an industrial process for the
      production of hydroxychloroquine sulfate:<br>
      <br>
      [0017]<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The method comprises: under nitrogen protection,
      4,7-dichloroquinoline is directly condensed with a
      hydroxychloroquine side chain at a high temperature for 13-24
      hours, then acidification and impurity removal, alkalization
      extraction, crystallization to obtain hydroxychloroquine free
      base, and then Hydrolysis with concentrated sulfuric acid in an
      alcohol solution gives hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The method is
      directly mixed and heated by a solvent-free method, and impurities
      of side chain dehydration polymerization are easily generated
      during the reaction, and 4,7-dichloroquinoline is easily sublimed
      at a high temperature, and heating for a long time causes
      4,7-dichloroquinoline from the reaction system. Sublimation in the
      middle, affecting the yield, after the end of the reaction, it is
      necessary to first adjust the acid, then alkalized, the operation
      is cumbersome, the waste water and waste solid amount are large,
      and the operation is cumbersome, and is not suitable for
      industrial production.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] CN102050781 discloses a process for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate. Similar to CA2561987, it is necessary
      to slowly distill off the reaction solvent, and it is necessary to
      control the distillation temperature and time, the reaction
      requires a large amount of solvent, and the temperature control
      process and the solvent are precisely controlled in industrial
      production. The steaming process is more difficult.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] CN104230803 discloses an industrial preparation method of
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate. The condensation reaction of
      4,7-dichloroquinoline with hydroxychloroquine side chain is
      carried out by distilling off the solvent under the catalysis of
      sodium alkoxide. Under high temperature conditions, sodium
      alkoxide will undergo nucleophilic substitution with
      4,7-dichloroquinoline to form an ether product, which is difficult
      to remove, affecting the purification of hydroxychloroquine free
      base, and the alcoholic hydroxyl group on the side chain is in
      sodium alkoxide. In the presence of hydroxy anion,
      4,7-dichloroquinoline produces by-products, which makes
      purification difficult, and the reaction should control the
      temperature rising process and solvent evaporation rate, and the
      operation is difficult.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In the preparation method of the above-disclosed
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, there are disadvantages, so it is
      necessary to find an industrial preparation method which is simple
      in operation, high in efficiency, high in yield and high in
      quality, and environmentally friendly.<br>

      toluene, chlorobenzene or xylene, or an aprotic strong polar
      solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylformamide. The
      solvent is used in an amount of from 3 times to 5 times the amount
      of 4,7-dichloroquinoline. The reaction temperature is 100-150
      degrees and the reaction time is 4-12 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] 5.The hydroxychloroquine free base can be purified by
      crystallization using an acetate, and may be selected from ethyl
      acetate, isopropyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, and preferably ethyl
      acetate.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] 6.Hydroxychloroquine free base is salted with sulfuric acid
      in an aqueous alcohol solution to obtain hydroxychloroquine
      sulfate. The alcohol may be selected from the group consisting of

      US Patent No. 5,314,894 discloses a process for preparing
      (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine wherein 4,7-dichloroquinoline and
      (S)-N'-ethyl-N'-β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine with
      N,N-diisopropylethylamine (b.p 127℃ were heated at reflux for 48
      hours to obtain (S)-(+)-hydroxychloroquine with a yield of 46%.<br>
      <br>
      Further, CA Patent No. 2,561,987 teaches a process for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine, which involves reacting 4,7-dichloroquinoline
      (2) with N'-ethyl-N'-β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine (3) at a
      temperature of 120 to 130℃ for 20 to 24 hours, and introducing a
      protective group, as illustrated below, to the reaction product so
      as to facilitate the removal of impurities, followed by hydrolysis
      of the protective group to obtain a desired product
      hydroxychloroquine.<br>
      <br>
      In formulae A, B, C, each PG represents a protective group.<br>
      <br>
      However, with currently known methods of preparing
      hydroxychloroquine and its acid addition salts, there is a
      difficulty in elimination of undesirable byproducts upon the
      preparation of acid addition salts, due to using a toxic solvent
      such as phenol or a reagent such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine,
      which has a high boiling point and a structure similar to that of
      the final product. Particularly, a long reaction time at high
      temperatures may result in increased production costs and buildup
      of byproducts, for which a higher-efficiency synthesis method of
      hydroxychloroquine and disulfate is required in related industrial
      fields.<br>
      <br>
      To this end, there is a need for the development of a novel method
      of synthesizing hydroxychloroquine, which is capable of overcoming
      a variety of problems and disadvantages as discussed above and is
      capable of providing a desired product with higher purity and
      yield.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is intended to provide a novel method for
      preparing hydroxychloroquine, which is capable of inhibiting the
      formation of byproducts and decreasing production costs by
      significantly decreasing a reaction temperature and a reaction
      time using a certain pressure, without a catalyst and a reaction
      solvent.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention provides a novel method for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine using a pressure, which comprises reacting
      4,7-dichloroquinoline with
      N'-ethyl-N'-β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine under high pressure to
      obtain hydroxychloroquine of the formula:<br>
      <br>
      That is, the method of the present invention provides the
      preparation of hydroxychloroquine by the reaction of
      4,7-dichloroquinoline with
      N'-ethyl-N'-β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine without use of a
      catalyst and a solvent.<br>
      <br>
      As used herein, the term "high pressure" refers to a more greater
      pressure than atmospheric pressure(1 atm, about 1 bar), which is
      preferably in the range of 5 to 30 bars and more preferably 10 to
      20 bars.<br>
      <br>
      In the context of the present invention, the high pressure is
      exerted by an inert gas such as nitrogen (N 2 ) or argon (Ar) gas
      or by moisture-free air.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction time is preferably within 10 hours and more
      preferably 6 hours.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction temperature is preferably in the range of 100 to
      120℃, although it may vary.<br>
      <br>
      A reaction molar ratio of 4,7-dichloroquinoline and
      N'-ethyl-N'-β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine is preferably in the
      range of 1:1.05 to 1.5 and more preferably 1:1.05 to 1.1, although
      it may vary.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the present invention provides a process for preparing
      hydroxychloroquine sulfate, comprising:<br>
      <br>
      (a) reacting 4,7-dichloroquinoline with
      N'-ethyl-N'-β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine under high pressure to
      obtain hydroxychloroquine of the formula:<br>
      <br>
      ; and<br>
      <br>
      (b) reacting the hydroxychloroquine of Step (a) with sulfuric acid
      (H 2 SO 4 ) to obtain hydroxychloroquine sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      Here, reaction conditions for Step (a) are as defined above.<br>
      <br>
      The preparation process of hydroxychloroquine according to the
      present invention will be described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      The process is carried out as follows. First,
      4,7-dichloroquinoline and
      N'-ethyl-N'-β-hydroxyethyl-1,4-pentadiamine in a molar ratio of
      1:1.1 were placed into a high pressure reactor. Internal pressure
      of the reactor is then adjusted to the range of 5 to 20 bars and
      preferably 10 to 15 bars by nitrogen pressure. The reactor is
      stirred at 80℃ for 30 min until 4,7-dichloroquinoline is
      completely dissolved, followed by further stirring at a
      temperature of 100 to 120℃ for 4 to 6 hours.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention enables the production of hydroxychloroquine
      with high purity and high yield while providing various advantages
      in that the formation of byproducts is inhibited by decreasing a
      reaction temperature and significantly decreasing a reaction time
      using a pressure without use of a catalyst and a reaction solvent,
      and production costs are reduced.<br>
      <br>
      Now, the present invention will be described in more detail with
      reference to the following Examples. These examples are provided
      only for illustrating the present invention and should not be
      construed as limiting the scope and spirit of the present
      invention.<br>
