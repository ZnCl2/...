          <br>
          <div align="left"> My name is Mark Hendershot, Lester J.
            Hendershot was my Father.<br>
            <br>
            Lester was an inventor and in his many attempts at producing
            practical items, he had a moderate success a few times with
            electronic toys, and had sold some of his ideas to small
            manufacturers. His biggest idea, however, was so
            revolutionary that it embarrassed the nation's top
            scientists be-cause they couldn't explain it, and if it
            could be perfected, it would possibly eliminate the need for
            public electric utilities in many instances, and it would
            completely change most of our present concepts of
            motivation.<br>
            <br>
            His earlier invention was called a "motor" by the
            newspapers, but it was actually a generator which was
            powered by the magnetic field of the earth. His later models
            created enough electricity to simultaneously light a 120
            volt light bulb and a table model radio. I witnessed it
            furnishing the power to run a television set and a sewing
            machine for hours at a time in our living room.<br>
            <br>
            It was in 1927 and 1928 that my Father began to think
            seriously about this "fuel-less" generator. He had taken up
            flying in 1925 and he soon realized that the ultimate
            development of aviation would be greatly enhanced by the
            creation of an absolutely true and reliable compass, and his
            first efforts were to produce such an instrument.<br>
            <br>
            He theorized that the magnetic compass did not point to true
            north and varies from true north to a different extent at
            almost every point on the earth's surface. Also, the
            induction compass has to be set before each flight and at
            that time was not always reliable. He claimed that with a
            pre-magnetized core he could set up a magnetized field that
            would indicate the true north, but he didn't know just how
            to utilize that in the compass he had set out to develop.<br>
            <br>
            In continuing his experiments, he found that by cutting the
            same line of magnetic force north and south, he had an
            indicator of the true north and that by cutting the magnetic
            field east and west, he could develop a rotary motion.<br>
            <br>
            With this principle in mind, he switched his plans and began
            working on a motor which utilized this magnetic power. He
            built one that would rotate at a constant speed, a speed
            pre-determined when the motor was built. It could be built
            for a desired speed, he said, and he felt that a reli-able
            constant speed motor was one of the greatest needs in
            aviation at that time. The one he built developed 1,800
            revolutions per minute.<br>
            <br>
            In the following years, he realized that the idea of a
            magnetically powered motor was not as practical as a
            magnetically-powered generator, so his later work was
            directed toward the generator.<br>
            <br>
            To avoid confusion, it should be pointed out that the early
            experiments began on a magnetically-powered motor, and later
            a generator.<br>
            <br>
            The first significant experiments on the motor version were
            held at Selfridge Field, Detroit, under the direction of
            Major Thomas G. Lanphier, commandant of the field and leader
            of the First Pursuit Group.<br>
            <br>
            The device demonstrated at Selfridge was a small model of
            what he hoped would be developed into an airplane engine
            [powered by earth's magnetic field]. Quotes in the
            newspapers referred to top aeronautical brass of the day and
            their impressions of what they saw.<br>
            <br>
            One such report was credited to William B. Stout, president
            of the Stout Air Service, Inc., and designer of the
            all-metal type plane used by the Ford Motor Company. Stout's
            comments were: "The demonstration was very impressive. It
            was actually uncanny. I would like very much to see a large
            model, designed to develop enough power to lift an
            airplane."<br>
            <br>
            Major Lanphier's comments to reporters after the
            demonstrations were:<br>
            <br>
            "The whole thing is so mysterious and startling that it has
            the appearance of being a fake."<br>
            <br>
            "I was extremely skeptical when I saw the first model," he
            continued, "but I helped to build the second one and
            witnessed the winding of the magnet. I am sure there was
            nothing phony about it."<br>
            <br>
            My Father had first shown the military brass how his model
            worked, then he supervised army technicians in building
            their own model, which worked perfectly. Major Lanphier said
            that the electrical men to whom they had shown the motor
            "... laughed at the way we wired it up and said it wouldn't
            work. Then it DID work."<br>
            <br>
            It was the Selfridge Field experiment which touched off the
            series of stories in the national press. Stories with
            blaring headlines in such papers as the Detroit Free Press,
            Detroit News, Detroit Times, Pittsburgh papers, The New York
            Times, and many others. Most of them tagged the instrument
            demonstrated at Selfridge the "miracle motor," and there
            were pictures of Major Lanphier and Col. Lindbergh, my
            Father and the motor.<br>
            <br>
            Anything in the news during that period which could be
            connected with Lindbergh was front page whether he had an
            active interest, or just happened to be in the area at the
            time.<br>
            <br>
            Headlines in the various papers read, "Gasless Motor Tested
            for Lindy," "Lindy Inspects Fuelless Motor for Airplanes",
            and "Lindbergh Tries Motor That The Earth Runs."<br>
            <br>
            One story even stated that, at its request, Lindbergh and
            Lanphier were flying to New York to show the motor to the
            Guggenheim Foundation for the Promotion of Aeronautics. <br>
            <br>
            Later reports, however, emphasized that Lindbergh actually
            had nothing whatsoever to do with the experiments, and that
            he had just witnessed a couple of the demonstrations as the
            guest of his friend, Major Lanphier.<br>
            <br>
            The Selfridge tests seemed to satisfy Lanphier and his
            associates, how-ever, and during the period he was there,
            the model the technicians built obtained as high as 1,800
            revolutions per minute and they announced its performance
            was entirely satisfactory. It was estimated these motors
            would run for 2,000 to 3,000 hours before the magnet center
            would have to be recharged.<br>
            <br>
            A man named Dr. F. W. Hochstetter, of the Hochstetter
            Research Laboratories in Pittsburgh, hastily called a news
            conference and displayed models of what he said were the
            "Hendershot Motor." He demonstrated them, and when they
            wouldn't work, he declared Hendershot was a fake, and that
            the motors worked only because of power derived from
            concealed pencil batteries.<br>
            <br>
            After he exhibited his models of the motor, Dr. Hochstetter
            announced that they wouldn't generate enough electricity to,
            "...light a 1-volt fire-fly" or to "...stitch a fairy's
            britches."<br>
            <br>
            Noting the lavish lecture room in a New York hotel which had
            been rented by (or for) Dr. Hochstetter for the press
            conference, Dr. Hochstetter was asked [by one reporter] why
            he was so interested in the Hendershot demonstrations and in
            trying to discredit them. He replied merely that he had
            "come to expose a fraud which would be capable of destroying
            faith in science for 1,000 years" and he claimed his only
            motive was that "pure science might shine forth
            untarnished."<br>
            <br>
            It was obvious to those who were pro-Hendershot that, in
            view of all the fuss and bother of such a noted scientist as
            Dr. Hochstetter, somewhere behind it all, someone was
            anxious for the innovation to be ridiculed.<br>
            <br>
            When approached with the accusations, my Father smiled and
            told reporters, "Dr. Hochstetter is correct, to a degree. I
            have concealed batteries in a model or two because I found
            that I could not trust some of my visitors, and I also had
            evidence that someone had tampered with my work. So, I put a
            couple of batteries in on occasion to lead the intruders
            away from what I was working on."<br>
            <br>
            He added that Major Lanphier and his army technicians were
            proof enough of his claims. "I didn't build the motor that
            was demonstrated at Detroit," he pointed out.<br>
            <br>
            "That was built by Army men under orders from Major Lanphier
            and under my direction. I didn't even so much as wind the
            motor. They built the motor and it works. That's my answer
            to all the critics—it works."<br>
            <br>
            Dr. Hochstetter and his associates also claimed my Father
            had signed a contract and received $25,000 for exploitation
            of the motor, but after a brief period of excitement, the
            matter was dropped—unproven.<br>
            <br>
            Not long after his demonstrations of the motor, Dr.
            Hochstetter died under unusual circumstances. He was in a
            Baltimore and Ohio train wreck, and he was the only
            passenger on the whole train who lost his life!<br>
            <br>
            My Father was the butt of many jokes and comments at the
            time of the debates about his invention. An artist, drawing
            for one of the Pittsburgh papers, depicted him in a cartoon
            riding a propellorless airplane. The caption made fun of
            him.<br>
            <br>
            In later years my Father remarked, "Every time I see a jet
            plane go over now, I think of that cartoon and how everyone
            laughed at me for suggest-ing a plane could some day fly
            without a propeller. Twenty-five years ago I tried to tell
            them that."<br>
            <br>
            As suddenly as it all started, the publicity and
            sensationalism of the Hendershot motor stopped. The last
            news story to appear was on March 10, 1928, when a small
            article appeared in most papers saying that Lester
            Hendershot was a patient in Emergency Hospital in
            Washington.<br>
            <br>
            The personal account he gave was much the same as the
            newspaper quote, with the minor exception that he was it by
            a bolt of 220 volts, not the jolting 2,000 the over-eager
            reporter had written. He was demonstrating the motor in the
            patent office, and the shock paralyzed his vocal chords,
            resulting in several weeks of recuperation before he
            completely recovered.<br>
            <br>
            Something happened during this period that could explain the
            actions of Dr. Hochstetter and his associates. My Father
            said that while he was in the hospital, he was approached by
            a large corporation to stop his activity in connection with
            the motor or generator.<br>
            <br>
            Until the day he died, he would not reveal the name of the
            company, only that if he were successful with his generator,
            it would be a serious threat to their multimillion dollar
            industry. He named the sum he accepted as $25,000, and the
            condition was that he was not to build another unit for
            twenty years. That's when he dropped out of sight.<br>
            <br>
            I've thought about the bizarre events connected with the
            generator, and feel it is possible the "large corporation"
            first tried to stop the activities through Dr. Hochstetter.
            When this failed, they approached my Father personally and
            bought him off. It's interesting to note that one of the
            doctor's charges was that he was paid $25,000 to exploit his
            work. Isn't it odd that this is the same figure actually
            paid, but to stop his activities, but was quoted before he
            was approached with the offer?<br>
            <br>
            My Father admitted that he and the family lived in constant
            fear, as we were being contacted every so often by crackpots
            who had delved into the records and discovered his creation,
            and had gone to the trouble of searching him out. Some of
            them, he suspected, were representatives of subversive
            groups and/or foreign powers.<br>
            <br>
            This latter charge seems a little exaggerated, but was
            supported by a series of letters he received from a fellow
            in Ohio in 1952. He had traced my Father by going back to
            his hometown in Pennsylvania and talking to my uncle about
            the generator.<br>
            <br>
            The first letter explained that he was a part of a group of
            scientists who were privately financing their own research
            on the same phenomena my Father discovered in 1928. He
            emphasized they would not allow backing by any organization
            or government since an invention such as the Hendershot
            Generator should be for, "all the peoples and should not be
            controlled by national governments, but should be given
            gratis to the World Government when it is ready to assume
            World Responsibility."<br>
            <br>
            He was critical of my Father for allowing the military to
            look at it in 1928.<br>
            <br>
            That letter was written in April, and in June a postcard
            came with the following terse message, "Will shortly make
            public via radio and news-paper, connection your generator
            with 'Flying Saucer Propulsion.' Request Security Clearance
            from Security Chief your group within forty-eight hours.
            Have succeeded in duplication of your Generator."<br>
            <br>
            In July my Father received a four-page hand-written epistle
            from the Ohio man. To my knowledge, it was the last letter
            the writer sent on the subject. He discussed information his
            intelligence had received on flying saucers, modestly
            admitting his sources were better than the CIA or the FBI,
            which he claimed had investigated him several times. He
            intimated that a Pasadena scientist had recently been
            kidnapped because he was working on an attempt to adapt the
            generator to aircraft.<br>
            <br>
            Then he went into a long and rambling dissertation on how he
            got interested in what he called the "Ether Vortex
            Phenomena" and the generator. He explained that the magnetic
            field in the earth and volcanic action are related,
            according to his studies. He had spent two and one-half
            years in Japan working with Japanese volcanic scientists on
            the subject.<br>
            <br>
            He mentioned one study he had made, and pointed out that the
            shift of the strata causing the volcano was due to a
            rotation of the Electromagnetic Field of the volcano at high
            speeds. He urged my Father to write a complete paper on his
            findings and publish them (preferably send them to the
            Earthquake Research Institute in Tokyo).<br>
            <br>
            Referring to a particularly bad earthquake which had just
            occurred in the Los Angeles vicinity a few months before,
            the writer warned my Father not to operate his generator in
            the area near the San Andreas (seismic) Fault which runs
            through the area.<br>
            <br>
            He said, "You may not believe it, but you can cause
            earthquake activity to increase if you continue to operate
            your generator in that district. I am wondering if you were
            not directly responsible for the recent earthquake near Los
            Angeles?"<br>
            <br>
            Then he promised that he and his associates would keep the
            possibility of his involvement in the earthquake to
            themselves.<br>
            <br>
            Letters such as these, plus occasional phone calls when the
            callers would not identify themselves, and a threat from an
            admitted Communist which was turned over to the FBI, caused
            my Father concern much of the time. If a large organization
            would take over the generator and its re-search, all he
            wanted out of it was enough money to take care of himself
            and his family in the future years.<br>
            <br>
            One of the most encouraging offers came in September of 1956
            when my Father received word that officials of the Mexican
            government wanted to meet with him and discuss the
            possibility of using his generator for the rural development
            program in Mexico.<br>
            <br>
            Government officials flew to Los Angeles and drove out to
            our house, where our family doctor who spoke Spanish acted
            as interpreter. Arrangements were made for the family to go
            to Mexico City, and for my Father to work with Mexican
            technicians on the generator.<br>
            <br>
            We all flew to Mexico City and were housed in an apartment
            near the home of the Director of Electricity. My Father
            supervised the Mexicans in building a model. He had been
            working with them for several weeks becoming more and more
            tense as time passed. He confessed to my Mother that he was
            frightened because he understood no Spanish, and his fellow
            workers talked constantly in little groups by themselves,
            often glancing over at him. He couldn't understand a word
            they were saying, and it worried him considerably.<br>
            <br>
            One morning in February of 1957, the laboratory called and
            asked where my Father was. My Mother told them he had left
            for work in the morning, and if he wasn't there, she had no
            idea where he might be. She became increasingly concerned as
            the day passed and there was no word from him.<br>
            <br>
            That night he didn't come home, and we were on the verge of
            hysteria by next morning, then we received a telegram from
            Los Angeles. My Father's fear had worked itself into a
            nervous frenzy and he had rushed to the airport the day
            before and taken a plane for California. To the day of his
            death, it was a closed subject and he would never explain
            why he was compelled to leave us so suddenly under such
            strange circumstances, except that he feared for his life.<br>
            <br>
            The final attempt to promote the generator came in the
            latter part of 1960 when a Dr. Lloyd E. Cannon convinced my
            Father that he had the facilities to present the project to
            the United States Navy for research and development.<br>
            <br>
            Cannon said he was the General Manager of his own company,
            Force Research of Los Angeles, Palm Springs and the Mojave
            Desert. Cannon explained that his group was made up of many
            dedicated scientists of various fields who contributed time
            and knowledge to Force Research projects. The range of
            experimentation covered electronics, astronautics, free
            energies, propulsion, and parapsychology.<br>
            <br>
            Under my Father's supervision, two models were built and 100
            copies of a fifty-six-page "proposal" were printed for
            presentation to the various government agencies and
            politicians who would have to review the project for its
            consideration.<br>
            <br>
            After the completion of the proposal and it had been sent to
            the government with no results, Cannon traveled the
            southwestern United States with the models trying to raise
            money for research. His visits were increasingly less
            frequent to our home until 1961, when a tragic climax to
            this story occurred.<br>
            <br>
            On April 19, 1961, upon returning home from school, I found
            my Father dead. It was recorded as a suicide without any
            further investigation. For those who might be interested in
            my Father's analysis of how his generator worked, the
            following are his theories on the subject:<br>
            <br>
            This field of magnetism surrounding the earth is similar to
            the field of magnetism in a man-made generator.<br>
            <br>
            The rotor of a generator is revolved by some means of power,
            cutting the lines of magnetism, creating electric power. The
            earth is turning inside of a field of magnetism. That, no
            one contradicts, yet it is claimed there is no power to be
            derived from it.<br>
            <br>
            Let's say we have a mechanism that will collect, polarize
            and create a positive and negative connection to this
            tremendous power that is ever-present on the earth.<br>
            <br>
            Take a survey compass. You can hold the needle east or west,
            and let go of it, and it immediately goes north and south.
            This same power, when cut by the proper apparatus as the
            earth rotates inside this magnetism, will produce power, the
            amount of which is not calculated at this time. <br>
            <br>
            As long as the earth rotates around the sun, it will create
            electric power which some scientists claim does not exist.
            Yet, we dig into the moun-tains for material that costs us
            unbelievable sums, to create the same power.<br>
            <br>
            This magnetism surrounding the earth is in the same relation
            to electric power as uranium is to atomic power. Earth's
            magnetism is ever-pres-ent at any height or depth. It is
            equal to uranium as a by-product for power, namely
            electricity. <br>
            <br>
            Magnetism must be cut. The lines of force circling the earth
            are constant and if this force is broken up, and polarized,
            you have the equivalent of uranium broken up, which creates
            a heat and in turn creates power.<br>
            <br>
            Breaking up the forces of magnetism, polarizing them,
            thereby creating a resistance for power, is the same
            principal as atomic energy. <br>
            <br>
            Scientists claim it requires friction to generate
            electricity. I claim the earth rotating as it does,
            according to scientific theory, creates friction as a
            generator. The ever-present magnetism is the field, or
            stator.<br>
            <br>
            We have only to utilize this source of power to light every
            home, high-way, bridge, airplane or any type of thing that
            cannot now be lighted because of inadequacy of present
            facilities. <br>
            <br>
            A very small unit composed of wire, a magnet, several
            especially designed coils, condensers, collector units, and
            a few other minor items, will cut this force. Another
            especially designed mechanism will polarize it, giving a
            positive and a negative connection to any resistance and the
            result is the generation of electricity.<br>
            <br>
            There you have the theory of how to create electricity from
            the magnetic force of the earth, as written by a man with
            only a high school education.<br>
            <br>
            As years went by I've always wanted to continue with my
            Father's invention, but have worried myself about possibly
            running into the same problems my Father did.<br>
            <br>
            It would not do my Father justice just to stop all work on
            it and now I am ready to fulfill his dream. Since childhood
            I have been fascinated by electricity and have spent over
            twenty-six years in the electrical trade.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp;Of his three sons, I alone have pursued this
            fascination and have applied my knowledge and experience to
            carry on my Father's work.<br>

            Referenced in the article: "THE SO-CALLED HENDERSHOT MOTOR
            by Gaston Burridge" is an article by the company Utily
            Engines. This is very good data and some data can be
            verified in other areas.<br>
            <br>
            NOTE: "In the May, 1953, issue of "Fate" magazine appeared
            an advertisement from the "Utility Engines' professing to
            have plans for sale of a so-called Hendershot motor for
            $2.50. Suddenly, all mail was rejected by the address of the
            "Utility Engines"! I asked Hendershot about this matter. He
            told me he learned of it soon after the advertisement was
            published. Soon after that he learned about the plans they
            were selling and using his name. They were doing this,
            Hendershot claimed, without his permission or consent. He
            told me that he promptly informed the postal authorities of
            this circumstance. "They must have done something about it,
            for I heard nothing more about them," he said. Hendershot
            was quite emphatic to me regarding the plans put out by the
            "Utility Engines" not being of his device. He was so
            emphatic, in fact, I felt he, like the maiden, "didst
            protest too much". Thus, 'the Ol hound dog's nose' went to
            the ground! In due course it came up with the information
            furnished by an acquaintance of Hendershot's to the effect
            that Hendershot had remarked at the time, while the "Utility
            Engines" information was not his device, "it was pretty damn
            close!""<br>
            <br>
            Also:<br>
            <br>
            "The first model consisted of a ring magnet less than three
            inches in diameter. Around the magnet were coils rigged as
            only Hendershot knows how to rig them, and another set of
            coils pass through the center of the ring."<br>
            <br>
            The second model is built around a ring magnet, the outside
            diameter of which is seven inches and the inside diameter
            six inches.''<br>
