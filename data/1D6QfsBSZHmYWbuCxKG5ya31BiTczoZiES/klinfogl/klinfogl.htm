      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sleek and silvery
          airplane shown here, flying in formation with its creators,
          Richard Kline and Floyd Fogleman, isn’t just any paper
          airplane. It is a paper airplane so remarkable and original
          that it is protected by two separate US patents.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a paper airplane so
          revolutionary that mockups of its wing have been put through
          wind-tunnel tests by NASA, the Navy, the Air Force, and the
          Army.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is a paper airplane so
          unconventional that it drives aerodynamics experts crazy. It
          seems to violate one of the major laws of flight: the
          Bernoulli principle, which explains, theoretically, what keeps
          all ordinary planes aloft. And it is a paper airplane whose
          plans are made public, for the first time, in this issue.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Most wings are round on top,
          flat on the bottom, so air plows over the top. This means the
          air is less dense on top and more dense on the bottom. As a
          result there is greater pressure on the bottom, which provides
          lift.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This wing, however, is flat
          on top and notched --- partially hollowed out --- on the
          bottom. Because it has more area on its underside, its "lift"
          should propel it toward the ground; it should sink like a
          rock.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It soars. So much for
          Bernoulli.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Richard Kline, a New York
          advertising-firm art director, had no idea he was about to
          start such a stir when, in 1968, he sat in his kitchen table
          in Mount Vernon, NY to make a paper airplane for his 6-year
          old son, Gary. He folded back the leading edge of a delta-wing
          design in such a way that he left an open slot on the
          underside of each wing. The plane flew straighter and farther
          than any paper airplane he had ever seen before. Even a living
          room was too small for a fair flight test.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More significant, when
          balanced and launched properly, the plane wouldn’t stall.
          Stalling is on of the principle causes of airplane accidents:
          the plane turns at too great an angle to the wind, loses its
          lift, and crashes into the ground. Some crashes can be traced
          to engine failure or an onboard fire or explosion, but most
          are tied to stalling. The plane suddenly loses its lift, and
          all the pilot’s controls become worthless.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kline’s little paper plane
          simply refused to stall. "I was just trying different things",
          Kline said later. "I had this idea that I wanted to make a
          glider that would reach its apogee and automatically level
          off."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;"One day I cut this
          thing out of paper, and it did exactly that, and I said,
          ‘That’s what I’m looking for’."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kline noticed that the plane
          was more stable when he opened the slots under the wings, but
          it was really his friend and advertising colleague, Floyd
          Fogleman, a weekend pilot and model builder, then realized
          that the notch under the wing represented "a whole new concept
          in aerodynamics". A partnership was born, and the men kept the
          discovery to themselves until their first patent was granted
          in December 1972. Soon after that, the articles began
          appearing in magazines and newspapers. There were stories in <i>Time</i>,
          <i>The London Daily Telegraph</i>, and <i>The Paris Express</i>.
          A 1973 feature on CBS’s <i>60 Minutes</i> proved so popular
          that it was repeated three years later.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kline and Fogleman remained
          cautious about revealing the instructions for folding their
          marvelous plane. Hobbyists studied pictures of the plane and
          footage of the few seconds of the <i>60 Minutes</i> segment
          during which Kline shows TV interviewer Morley Safer the first
          few folds. Viewers tried to reconstruct the design, but most
          failed miserably.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fold, in fact, isn’t
          simple; you’ll probably make a few mistakes before you get it
          right. You can make two planes from our master designs --- one
          to practice on one to get exactly right. Even so, you might
          want to practice first on an ordinary sheet of heavy typing
          paper. Cut the paper down to the dimensions in our diagrams,
          and use the fold lines on the master designs to get all the
          proportions correct.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A few flying hints: Before
          each launch, view the plane head-on and make sure the tops of
          each wing are horizontal and that both wings are of equal
          thickness. Check to see that the vertical stabilizer is
          pointing straight up and that the tape on the nose has no
          loose ends. You can wedge a paper clip into the fuselage just
          behind the nose to balance the plane and extend its flights.
          Experiment with clips of different sizes. And when you find
          one that works, use a small piece of tape to reinforce the
          fuselage just in front of the tail. Fogleman reports some
          exceptionally long glides after tossing the plane up into the
          wind. If properly launched, the craft gains altitude rapidly
          and then flies with the breeze.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Aerodynamics experts who
          looked at the plane said it would never fly --- not with that
          notch, or "step", on the underside of the wing. "They would
          tell me, ‘Forget it. It won’t work’, Kline says. "But me, I
          never heard of Bernoulli, so what do I know? It works, that’s
          all."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How does it work? The
          inventors didn’t know. So with patent papers safely in hand,
          they set out to find someone who could tell them. They took it
          to one of America’s leading aerodynamics experts, John
          Nicolaides, a former NASA official and onetime head of the
          aerospace-engineering departments at both Notre Dame and
          California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nicolaides, whose "flying
          flivver" was the subject of a story in one of <i>Omni</i>’s
          first issues ["A Flyer for the Masses", Dec. 1978], was
          skeptical at first. He became a believer, however, when the
          men visited him at Notre Dame and tested a paper model in the
          campus’s athletic center. "One of my throws went into the
          lights of the arena, struck the roof, and then glided clear
          across the building and into the seats", says Kline.
          "Nicolaides couldn’t believe it."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This one flight, more than
          anything else, convinced the aerodynamics expert that the toy
          deserved some serious wind-tunnel tests. "The data were
          strange", Nicolaides said, "not like any wind-tunnel data I
          had ever seen". Nicolaides confirmed that the wing was a true
          breakthrough in design and that it greatly resists stalling.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But why? "I don’t know",
          Nicolaides told Safer on <i>60 Minutes</i>. "A conventional
          wing, with increasing angle of attack, increases its lift. But
          eventually, at a steep critical angle the wing can suddenly
          lose its lift, causing the plane to crash. The Kline-Fogleman
          wing doesn’t do that. It has good lift for small angles of
          attack, but a t larger angles, the lift declines and the plane
          just levels off. This happens even at very large angles of
          attack, which allows it to avoid the tragic stall phenomenon."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Wind tunnel tests showed
          that the Kline-Fogleman wing was stable at angles well over 16
          to 18 degrees. That’s the inclination at which ordinary wings
          lose their lift and begin to stall. In fact, the
          Kline-Fogleman wing stubbornly resists stalling all the way up
          to a 45 degree angle of attack.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fogleman says that the tests
          complement observations he made using a homebuilt
          radio-controlled model plane with a 6-foot wingspan. "I tested
          our design with different curvatures on the top and the bottom
          of the wing", he says, "and the most impressive thing about
          them all is that they don’t want to spin. There is a spinning
          maneuver in competitions. You take the normal radio-controlled
          plane and fly it up to a stall angle, and it will suddenly
          snap over and go into a spin. Our plane won’t do that. You
          have to cut the throttle and control the ailerons and rudder
          all at once to force it to spin. And you can spin it in either
          direction, which is unusual. Most planes will spin only in the
          direction of their torque, opposite the way the propeller is
          turning. Our plane seems to resist that torque, so you can
          spin it either way. When you take your hands off the controls,
          the plane comes out of the spin in less than half a turn and
          returns to straight and level flight."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just as when you have to
          force the plane to spin, you also have to force it to stall.
          "You can’t get it to stall like an ordinary plane", Fogleman
          says. "It just keeps on porpoising on ahead. When you cut
          power on landing, it doesn’t stall either, as other planes do,
          but just keeps going flat ahead. Also, other planes will tip
          stall --- one wingtip goes down, and the plane spins out of
          control and crashes --- if they are brought in for a landing
          at too slow a speed or too high an angle. Our plane just
          refuses to tip stall."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One would think that the Air
          Force and NASA would be eager to perform exhaustive tests on
          the Kline-Fogleman wing and its variations. Apparently that
          hasn’t happened. "We know NASA tested it", Fogleman says, "but
          we couldn’t get any results from them, and neither could
          Nicolaides."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In 1979, P.K. Pierpont, then
          manager of the airfoil-research program at NASA’s Langley
          Research Center in Virginia, told Omni about three studies,
          one of them partially funded by NASA. All had come up with the
          same results: The Kline-Fogleman wing was found to have a poor
          lift-to-drag (L/D) ratio --- a standard measure of wing
          efficiency. These results indicated that the airfoil had no
          practical application, Pierpont said, so no further tests were
          made.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And according to Bud
          Bobbitt, chief of NASA’s transonic-aerodynamics division, test
          showed that the Kline-Fogleman wing was inefficient. The L/D
          numbers weren’t encouraging, so studying the wing’s resistance
          to stalling became a low priority.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Max Davis, of the Air Force
          Flight Dynamics Lab at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in
          Dayton, OH, told a similar story. A few tests were performed
          after all the publicity in 1973, he said, but preliminary
          studies indicated that the wing was not suitable for a
          full-size aircraft because it has too much drag and not enough
          lift.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"All that is true",
          Nicolaides says, "but it misses the point. This airfoil
          doesn’t have great lift at low angles, I grant that. But at
          high angles, where most planes spin out of control and crash,
          this one keeps flying."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Furthermore, Nmicolaides
          found that at subsonic speeds, the wing worked even better
          when it was turned upside down, with the notch on the top
          instead of on the bottom. In the notch-up mode, the wing’s
          lift improved by 44% and its L/D ratio improved by about 30%.
          And it still refused to stall.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That was enough to convince
          Nicolaides that the Kline-Fogleman wing deserved serious study
          by the US government.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In April 1973 Nicolaides
          wrote letters to NASA, the Air Force, and the Navy, urging
          them to test the Kline-Fogleman wing in all conceivable
          configurations: notch down, notch up, rounded leading edge,
          curved wing surfaces, varied curvature and placement of the
          notch, and so on. Nicolaides enclosed copies of his
          encouraging wind-tunnel data.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Apparently, the government
          experts with the big testing facilities generally ignored most
          of Nicolaides recommendations. Even when they put the
          Kline-Fogleman wing through its paces, they concentrated on
          the lift and drag data, not the resistance to stalling, or
          they studied only the razor edge version, not the rounded,
          more winglike variation. In explaining the space agency’s lack
          of interest, Pierpont said in 1979 that the flight
          characteristics of the Kline-Fogleman wing were no better than
          those of a flat plate. But this assertion was disputed by the
          wind-tunnel data in Nicolaides’s 1973 letter to NASA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All of this would seem to
          indicate a marked lack of interest in exploring an idea that
          could save lives and airplanes. At worst, it suggests that the
          government did test wings that qualify as Kline-Fogleman
          variations but won’t reveal the test results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It boils down to this: If
          the suggested tests weren’t done, why not? And if they were
          done, why weren’t the results made known to Nicolaides, Kline,
          Fogleman, or an inquiring reporter from <i>Omni</i>?</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One line of speculation is
          that the government is withholding the data for national
          security reasons. Another is that officials perceive a
          possible overlap between the Kline-Fogleman idea and the
          do-called Whitcomb supercritical wing. This wing, invented by
          Richard Whitcomb and patented by NASA in 1976, permits planes
          to fly close to the sound barrier without being buffeted by
          turbulence on top of the airfoil. This feat is made possible
          by the wing’s unusual shape. It’s relatively flat on the top,
          with a concavity on the undersurface, The hollowed section
          isn’t the abrupt notch of the Kline-Fogleman patent drawings,
          but it is well within the range of variations that Nicolaides
          suggested for testing (When I asked Nicolaides to describe the
          Whitcomb wing, he called it "a regular wing with a
          smoothed-out Kline-Fogleman notch on the bottom.")</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It’s possible that Kline and
          Fogleman were awarded a patent on an idea that includes
          features of the Whitcomb wing. If so, government officials,
          firmly wedded to Whitcomb’s design, may be trying to sharpen
          the distinction between the two ideas by downplaying the
          airworthiness of the Kline-Fogleman prototype.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I don’t know whether the
          whole story will ever come out", Nicolaides says. "But the
          important thing to remember is that the Kline-Fogleman wing
          doesn’t stall. If the government tsters say that it is not
          quite as good as other wings in terms of lift-to-drag ratios,
          they are neglecting to say that it is infinitely better in
          terms of not killing people. That’s what the Kline-Fogleman
          wing is all about."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">&nbsp;"What I keep coming
          back to", says Kline, "is the whole question of what makes our
          airfoil so stable. We believe that the notches cause pockets
          of air tubulence to be trapped on the underside of the wings
          and that these pockets somehow support the aircraft at steep
          angles of attack. No one, as far as I know, has studied what’s
          going on in these pockets."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Until proper tests are
          conducted, it is hard to tell what promise the Kline-Fogleman
          wing holds. So far the most encouraging findings have come
          from model plane hobbyists, backyard testers and small
          aircraft companies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Amerijet, Inc., an Ohio firm
          producing single-engine planes, is testing a Kline-Fogleman
          wing to be used on a two-seater aircraft. If the
          stress-analysis and wind-tunnel tests go as expected, the
          company will build the first full-scale Kline-Fogleman
          aircraft in about two years.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">J.B. Mitroo, president of
          Amerijet, told Omni that preliminary tests indicate that the
          wing will actually improve the efficiency of flight, bringing
          about a 25 to 35% saving s in fuel.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the model-airplane front,
          findings continue to be impressive. Pete Reed, of Avon, CT,
          tried a Kline-Fogleman wing on a radio-controlled model plane
          that had a habit of stalling. "It solved the problem", he
          says. "The plane doesn’t stall anymore, and the difference is
          spectacular. It flies better than any other plane I have used.
          With my old plane, if you slowed it down it would stop flying
          and it would tip stall to one side or the other. I can haul
          the Kline-Fogleman model up to a very high angle of attack or
          slow it way down, and the plane still won’t tip stall. The
          only problem is that the wing adds a lot of drag and the plane
          flies slower than before."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reed thinks the drag problem
          might be corrected if the Kline-Fogleman shape were used only
          on the outer quarter or third of each wing, rather than along
          its full length. "If a stall starts at the base of the wing,
          next to the fuselage, you have time to correct it. But if it
          starts at the wingtip, it spreads to the rest of the wing
          before you know it, and there is nothing you can do but watch
          the thing crash."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reed suggests another
          promising variation: carving the blades of a propeller into a
          Kline-Fogleman profile. "I tried it once. I didn’t take any
          hard measurements, but the plane seemed to fly faster", he
          says.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In another test on the idea
          of a Kline-Fogleman propeller, George Leu, of South Orange,
          NJ, cut a Kline-Fogleman notch into the two blades of an
          11-inch diameter model airplane propeller.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When he attached a fish
          scale to a plane equipped with an ordinary propeller and
          revved the engine, he got a maximum pull of about 10 pounds.
          "When I put the Kline-Fogleman prop on the same plane, I got
          11 pounds of pull. It was amazing. The people I was flying
          with could hardly believe it. Fish scales aren’t the most
          accurate devices, but the one I used did measure a positive
          difference, and that sure makes me think this design has
          possibilities. When I flew the plane with its Kline-Fogleman
          prop, it seemed to have a lot more vertical power than before,
          and I needed to give it less correction than usual to get it
          to do such standard maneuvers as rolling and looping."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The romantic in us would
          like to think that a significant breakthrough in aerodynamics
          had its beginning on a kitchen table in New York. That a
          father making a toy for his son hit upon just the right
          combination of paper glue, scotch tape and luck. Whether this
          is a tale of genuine discovery or just a fantasy of what might
          have been has not yet been answered. We’re rooting for the
          kitchen table.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A friend of Floyd's George
          Leu of South Orange, NJ, was one of the recipients of an
          experimental set of propeller blades. Leu had many years'
          experience flying radio-controled aircraft with Floy, and he
          agreed to conduct the propeller-blade test. The experimental
          blades were 11 inches long and had a 7 degree angle of pitch;
          the engine used was a Webra Speed 0.60 cubic inch.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Leu conducted a simple
          static test with a radio-controlled plane anchored to the
          ground. A spring-loaded fish scale was used to determine the
          mount of pull or thrust prodcued by both a conventional blade
          adn the Kline-Fogleman prop. The results were striking. The
          conventional blade pulled a maximum of 10 pounds. But when Leu
          put the Kline-Fogleman prop on, he got 11 pounds of thrust, or
          a 10% increase in thrust with slightly fewer RPMs (a 200 RPM
          drop in a 13,500 RPM run). The test was repeated a second
          time, adn teh results remained the same.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then Leu put the
          Kline-Fogleman prop on his radio-controlled plane and flew it.
          he noticed that it climbed vertically with much more power
          than with the conventional prop that he had flown before...</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background of the
            Invention</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The invention relates to
          airfoils, especially airfoils having lift and drag
          characteristics suitable for aircraft wing sections and the
          like. In the comparatively low or subsonic speed range, the
          conventional airfoil has cambered surfaces that define a
          profile of gradually decreasing thickness from the leading
          edge to the trailing edge. For high or supersonic speeds, the
          airfoil camber is comparatively small and the wing thin so
          that the upper and under surfaces tend to be substantially
          planar.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It follows therefore, that
          the drag characteristics of the subsonic airfoil are not
          suitable for supersonic speed, whereas the lift
          characteristics of the supersonic airfoil are not well suited
          for low airspeeds. The present invention is concerned with
          providing a new and basic airfoil design that can be readily
          varied to meet the requirements of a wide range of airspeeds.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Summary of the Invention</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In accordance with the
          invention, an air foil having a basic design that lends itself
          to use in aircraft throughout a wide range of airspeeds,
          comprises a continuous upper surface, and a stepped under
          surface. The leading edge of the airfoil is defined by the
          apex of a wedge-shaped section that is formed by angular
          convergence of the upper surface and a generally planar
          portion of the under surface. Starting at the leading edge,
          the diverging under surface terminates abruptly in advance of
          the leading edge to form on the airfoil under surface a
          step-like discontinuity that extends spanwise of the airfoil.
          Rearward of the discontinuity, i.e., the base of the
          wedge-shape section, the airfoil has a comparatively thin
          cross-section that terminates as the trailing edge of the
          airfoil proper.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For varying drag and lift
          characteristics according to airspeed, the apex angle of the
          wedge-shape section can be varied, and the diverging under
          side can be shortened or lengthened to vary the location of
          the defined step with respect to the trailing edge.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A principal object of the
          invention therefore, is a new and improved airfoil for
          aircraft having a minimum of design parameters for adapting
          the airfoil to a wide variety of airspeeds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further object of the
          invention is an airfoil of the character above having a
          continuous upper surface and a lower surface having a stepped
          discontinuity, the surfaces being angularly and spacially
          related to define a chord section that increases in thickness
          from the leading edge of the airfoil to the discontinuity.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A related object is an
          improved airfoil as defined above, having advantageously
          combined lift, drag and stability characteristics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These and other objects,
          features and advantages will become apparent from the
          following description with reference to the accompanying
          drawings.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description of Preferred
            Embodiment</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The airfoil of the invention
          is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 as applied by way of
          example, to fixed-wing aircraft of the high speed type. It
          will be understood, however, from the following description
          that the invention is not limited to high speed or even fixed
          wing types, and that it can be used advantageously in rotary
          wing aircraft, and also in comparatively small, low-speed
          aircraft of the propeller-driven type, as well as in
          intermediate speed types.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring first to Figure 1,
          the aircraft 10 comprises a conventional streamlined fuselage
          12 with empennage 14 and swept-back wings 16 and 18 that
          constitute the improved airfoils of the invention. The lateral
          edges of the wings converge toward the rear of the fuselage so
          that as viewed from above, the composite area of the wings is
          of generally diamond configuration. Since descriptions of
          remaining equipment, such as thrust engines, landing gear,
          etc., are unnecessary for understanding the invention, these
          items are not shown in the drawings; it is sufficient to
          mention that conventional jet engines can be carried by the
          wing structure in suitable manner (suspension, cantilever,
          etc.) according to aircraft CG and other factors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The airfoils constituting
          the wings 16 and 18 in Figure 1, are mounted on the fuselage
          so as to have a small angle-of-attack according to usual
          practice when the aircraft is on the runway. Each wing, taking
          for example wing 16 and referring now to Figure 2, comprises
          an extensive main section 24 that extends from along the wing
          leading edge 26 toward the wing trailing edge. The section 24
          terminates to form a step 28 that defines a discontinuity in
          the under surface of the wing between the leading and trailing
          edges. As indicated in figure 1, the step 28 extends outwardly
          from the fuselage, its root section at, or spanwise of the
          wing in the general direction of the wing Y-axis, in contrast
          with the angular direction of the swept-back leading edge 26
          of the wing. As in the general case of airfoils that
          constitute aircraft wings, the relative air flow with respect
          to the airfoil is from the leading edge in direction generally
          parallel to the root section and rearwardly to the free
          trailing edge, and thence downstream in substantially the same
          general direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As best shown in Figure 2,
          the underside of the wing is basically formed by the main
          section 20 and the undersection 24 that is of wedge-shape with
          its apex coinciding with the leading edge of the wing. The
          wedge-like section 24 is joined to the main section 20 beneath
          the forward part thereof, with the wedge apex as indicated
          above merging with the front edge of the main section to form
          the leading edge 26 of the wing, and the wedge base forming
          the "riseR" of the step at 28.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The design angle made
          between the sections 20 and 24, i.e., the apex angle, can be
          varied in accordance with aerodynamic considerations, lift,
          drag, etc., as also can the location of the step with respect
          to the trailing edge that determines the ratio between the
          wing top and surface area (section 20) and the under surface
          area of section 24. The "riser" portion at 28 of the step
          (indicated by dotted line in Figure 1) can be either sealed or
          left open, depending on preferred construction of section 24,
          aerodynamic stresses, etc. For low airspeeds, the riser
          portion may remain comparatively open, as desired.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reference will now be made
          to Figures 3 to 7 for a more detailed description of the new
          airfoil embodying the invention. As the aircraft is
          symmetrical with respect to its main axes, the half-sections
          shown in Figures 3 and 4 are sufficient for illustrating
          possible variations in the airfoil configuration. Figure 3
          indicates a conventional fuselage 30 with one wing 32
          constituting an airfoil of the basic character illustrated by
          Figures 1 and 2. The view, looking toward the swept-back
          leading edge at 34, shows the continuous upper surface 36 of
          the airfoil as slightly convex between the fuselage and outer
          wing tip 38, as is also the lower surface 40 of the wedge-like
          under section 42.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For illustrating the
          structural form of the airfoil 32, Figures 3A to 3D are
          cross-sectional views taken at the section lines A-A, B-B,
          etc., respectively, of Figure 3. The section nearest the
          fuselage (Figure 3A) shows the wedge-like under portion 42 as
          shaving a small apex angle and extending to the step 44 at
          somewhat less than half the distance to the trailing edge 46.
          The apex angle increases somewhat at the mid-section of the
          airfoil, Figures 3B and 3C, to about 10 degrees with the step
          distance from the leading edge decreasing as shown by Figure
          1. Neat the wing tip, Figure 3D, the wedge apex angle
          decreases for gradual tapering-off at the wing tip. The upper
          wing section shortens, generally according to distance from
          wing tip so as to conform with the wing shape of Figure 1.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 4 illustrates the
          invention as embodied in a modified airfoil 50 especially
          adapted for high speeds, such as in the supersonic range.
          Here, the apex angle of the wedge under portion 52 remains
          substantially constant at a small angle, such as 5-6 degrees,
          throughout the leading edge 54 from the fuselage 30 to the
          wing tip 56. The under-surface discontinuity or step, is
          located with reference to the trailing edge as illustrated in
          Figure 1. Accordingly, the thickness of the airfoil 50 is
          materially reduced as compared with Figure 3 and the upper
          wing surface, as well as the lower surface of the wedge are
          substantially planar. The airfoil cross-sections at the
          transversely spaced sections A, B, C, and D, are shown by
          Figures 4A to 4D respectively, and further description thereof
          is unnecessary in view of Figures 3A to 3D for an

            Embodiment</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The airfoil of the invention
          is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 as applied by way of
          example, to fixed-wing aircraft of the high speed type. It
          will be understood, however, from the following description
          that the invention is not limited to high speed or even fixed
          wing types, and that it can be used advantageously in rotary
          wing aircraft, and also in comparatively small, low-speed
          aircraft of the propeller-driven type, as well as in
          intermediate speed types.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring first to Figure 1,
          the aircraft 10 comprises a conventional streamlined fuselage
          12 with empennage 14 and swept-back wings 16 and 18 that
          constitute the improved airfoils of the invention. The lateral
          edges of the wings converge toward the rear of the fuselage so
          that as viewed from above, the composite area of the wings is
          of generally diamond configuration. Since descriptions of
          remaining equipment, such as thrust engines, landing gear,
          etc., are unnecessary for understanding the invention, these
          items are not shown in the drawings; it is sufficient to
          mention that conventional jet engines can be carried by the
          wing structure in suitable manner (suspension, cantilever,
          etc.) according to aircraft CG and other factors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The airfoils constituting
          the wings 16 and 18 in Figure 1, are mounted on the fuselage
          so as to have a small angle-of-attack according to usual
          practice when the aircraft is on the runway. Each wing, taking
          for example wing 16 and referring now to Figure 2, comprises
          an extensive main section 24 that extends from along the wing
          leading edge 26 toward the wing trailing edge. The section 24
          terminates to form a step 28 that defines a discontinuity in
          the under surface of the wing between the leading and trailing
          edges. As indicated in figure 1, the step 28 extends outwardly
          from the fuselage, its root section at, or spanwise of the
          wing in the general direction of the wing Y-axis, in contrast
          with the angular direction of the swept-back leading edge 26
          of the wing. As in the general case of airfoils that
          constitute aircraft wings, the relative air flow with respect
          to the airfoil is from the leading edge in direction generally
          parallel to the root section and rearwardly to the free
          trailing edge, and thence downstream in substantially the same
          general direction.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As best shown in Figure 2,
          the underside of the wing is basically formed by the main
          section 20 and the undersection 24 that is of wedge-shape with
          its apex coinciding with the leading edge of the wing. The
          wedge-like section 24 is joined to the main section 20 beneath
          the forward part thereof, with the wedge apex as indicated
          above merging with the front edge of the main section to form
          the leading edge 26 of the wing, and the wedge base forming
          the "riser" of the step at 28.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The design angle made
          between the sections 20 and 24, i.e., the apex angle, can be
          varied in accordance with aerodynamic considerations, lift,
          drag, etc., as also can the location of the step with respect
          to the trailing edge that determines the ratio between the
          wing top and surface area (section 20) and the under surface
          area of section 24. The "riser" portion at 28 of the step
          (indicated by dotted line in Figure 1) can be either sealed or
          left open, depending on preferred construction of section 24,
          aerodynamic stresses, etc. For low airspeeds, the riser
          portion may remain comparatively open, as desired.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reference will now be made
          to Figures 3 to 7 for a more detailed description of the new
          airfoil embodying the invention. As the aircraft is
          symmetrical with respect to its main axes, the half-sections
          shown in Figures 3 and 4 are sufficient for illustrating
          possible variations in the airfoil configuration. Figure 3
          indicates a conventional fuselage 30 with one wing 32
          constituting an airfoil of the basic character illustrated by
          Figures 1 and 2. The view, looking toward the swept-back
          leading edge at 34, shows the continuous upper surface 36 of
          the airfoil as slightly convex between the fuselage and outer
          wing tip 38, as is also the lower surface 40 of the wedge-like
          under section 42.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For illustrating the
          structural form of the airfoil 32, Figures 3A to 3D are
          cross-sectional views taken at the section lines A-A, B-B,
          etc., respectively, of Figure 3. The section nearest the
          fuselage (Figure 3A) shows the wedge-like under portion 42 as
          shaving a small apex angle and extending to the step 44 at
          somewhat less than half the distance to the trailing edge 46.
          The apex angle increases somewhat at the mid-section of the
          airfoil, Figures 3B and 3C, to about 10 degrees with the step
          distance from the leading edge decreasing as shown by Figure
          1. Near the wing tip, Figure 3D, the wedge apex angle
          decreases for gradual tapering-off at the wing tip. The upper
          wing section shortens, generally according to distance from
          wing tip so as to conform with the wing shape of Figure 1.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 4 illustrates the
          invention as embodied in a modified airfoil 50 especially
          adapted for high speeds, such as in the supersonic range.
          Here, the apex angle of the wedge under portion 52 remains
          substantially constant at a small angle, such as 5-6 degrees,
          throughout the leading edge 54 from the fuselage 30 to the
          wing tip 56. The under-surface discontinuity or step, is
          located with reference to the trailing edge as illustrated in
          Figure 1. Accordingly, the thickness of the airfoil 50 is
          materially reduced as compared with Figure 3 and the upper
          wing surface, as well as the lower surface of the wedge are
          substantially planar. The airfoil cross-sections at the
          transversely spaced sections A, B, C, and D, are shown by
          Figures 4A to 4D respectively, and further description thereof
          is unnecessary in view of Figures 3A to 3D for an
          understanding of this aspect of the invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 5 which is a plan
          view, referring to Figure 3, shows more explicitly the spacial
          relation between the under-surface discontinuity and the
          leading and trailing edges. Here, the airfoil 60 is in top
          plan view, with the sectional views Gigs. 5A to 5D taken as
          before at spaced points between the fuselage junction edge 62
          and the wing tip 64. The step 66, as generally shown in Fig. 1
          (and in Fogs. 5A to 5D) extends from the fuselage edge to the
          wing tip at a swept-back angle materially smaller than that of
          the leading edge 68. The apex angle in this instance can be
          comparatively small, i.e., ranging between 4 and 6 degrees, so
          that the wing is sufficiently thin for high air speeds.
          Although the upper wing surface and the under surface of the
          wedge portion are preferably slightly convex with respect to
          the generally linear leading edge, these surfaces for
          practical purposes may be considered planar.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figs. 6 and 7 are different
          views of sections of the airfoil, Fig. 5, wherein the upper
          and lower wing surfaces are slightly convex with respect to
          the horizontal center line, Fig. 6, rather than linear as in
          Fig. 4. In Fig. 6 the airfoil 70 has an upper surface 72 that
          increases in convexity from the root or fuselage end, to the
          wing tip, Fig. 7. The apex angle of the under-surface wedge
          portion 78 varies in the manner described above for defining
          convex wedge surfaces as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The resulting
          airfoil is of moderate thickness suitable for lower airspeeds
          than those for Fig. 4; also the convex surface provides for
          increased stability. Fig. 7 which shows a perspective view of
          the airfoil at the section line 7-7 of Fig. 6 illustrates the
          relationship between the varying apex angle and height of step
          79 to the convexity of the upper and lower wing surfaces.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The comparatively thin
          trailing portion resulting from the abrupt undersurface
          discontinuity as described above, is intended to be
          aerodynamically functional throughout full utilization of the
          airfoil; that is, the space beneath the thin portion
          downstream of the step is not intended to be occupied, as for
          housing auxiliary equipment, flaps, etc., that would in
          effect, tend to eliminate or markedly reduce the aerodynamic
          effect of the discontinuity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figs. 8 and 9 show the
          invention as embodied in the airfoils of rotating wing type
          aircraft. In Fig. 8 a helicopter 80 is provided with rotating
          airfoils or blades 82 wherein at least the outer portion of
          each blade is constructed according to the basic configuration
          described above. Fig. 9 is an enlarged view of the outer (or
          peripheral speed) end of the rotor blade wherein the
          continuous upper surface 84 is substantially planar and the
          under surface is characterized by a wedge-like portion 86
          defining a step-like discontinuity 88 intermediate the leading
          edge 90 and the trailing edge 92. The apex or leading edge
          angle is a function of rotor rpm and required lift
          characteristics, and as shown is approximately 10 degrees.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the major part of the
          lift produced by helicopter blades is at the outer third of
          the blade length by reason of the greater swept area and
          higher blade velocity thereat, the under-surface step can be
          terminated as desired by gradual merging with the blade at an
          intermediate point as indicated by dotted lines 88 in Fig. 8.
          An important consideration in the use of the present airfoil
          for helicopter blades is that the blades can be efficiently
          rotated at speeds for bringing the tip speeds into the
          supersonic range by reason of the improved lift and drag
          characteristics of the thinner high speed airfoil. It will
          also be apparent that where desired, the invention can readily
          be incorporated in airfoil control sections such as elevators
          and rudders, as well as in the main lifting or wing sections.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring further to the
          airfoil configuration of Fig. 9, it will become apparent that
          the basic geometry of the airfoil can be varied to
          considerable extent while retaining the essential novel
          concept of the invention. For example, the apex or wedge angle
          can be varied from several degrees as described above, to as
          much as 30 degrees for obtaining lift and stability
          characteristics under lower airspeed conditions. Also, the
          ration of the upper or camber surface area at 84 to the
          under-surface area at 94 of the wedge portion (always greater
          than unity) can be varied by location of the discontinuity
          (step) with reference to the trailing edge, according to
          aerodynamic characteristics desired.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The upper and lower camber
          surfaces of the airfoil can be substantially planar, as in
          Fig. 4, or slightly convex as in Figs. 3 and 6. Preferable,
          the convexity of these surfaces is limited at the point of
          maximum bow with respect to a horizontal reference to about 2
          percent of the fore-aft length of the surfaces at 84 and 94
          respectively. The so-called riser portion of the step at 88 is
          not limited to an approximately right angle as shown for
          convenience in Figs. 3A, etc., and 5A, etc., but may be
          inclined to a greater or lesser extent than that shown in Fig.
          9 for example.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As regards aerodynamic
          theory, the technical reasons for the improved performance of
          the present airfoil are unknown to the inventors. Small-scale

    <blockquote><b><i>Description</i></b>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates generally to an airfoil for aircraft,
        and more particularly, to an airfoil that has improved stability
        and performance characteristics through a wide range of
        airspeeds. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention constitutes an improvement over
        applicants' previously patented unique airfoil disclosed in U.S.
        Pat. No. 3,706,430, dated Dec. 19, 1972, entitled AIRFOIL FOR
        AIRCRAFT. The airfoil of that patent included a wedge-like
        section formed by a continuous first surface which extended
        between the leading and trailing edges, and a second surface
        that was joined to the first surface along the leading edge. The
        second surface projected rearwardly in the direction of the
        trailing edge and terminated materially in advance thereof to
        define a step-like discontinuity of the airfoil. The thickness
        of the airfoil gradually increased from the leading edge to
        approximately 50% of the chord to form the wedge-like section,
        at which point, the second surface was sharply projected in the
        direction of the first surface to form the step-like
        discontinuity. </p>
      <p>It was found from flight tests of small airplane models
        constructed having the above described airfoil, that the tested
        airfoil demonstrated unusually good lift, stability and pitching
        moment characteristics. For example, the airfoil greatly
        resisted stalling in that it was necessary to induce an angle of
        attack between 30.degree. - 40.degree. before the stall
        occurred, as distinguished from angle of attack values between
        18.degree. - 22.degree. common to conventional airfoils. The
        technical explanation for such improved performance is unknown
        to the inventors and appears to be contrary to accepted
        aerodynamic theory. However, since the effect of stalling plays
        a significant role in accident reports, it is apparent that by
        resisting stalling, the above airfoil can materially increase
        the safety of flight. </p>
      <p>Continued tests have shown that the patented airfoil has a poor
        glide ratio in the range between 3:1 - 4:1. While various lift
        generating devices, such as flaps, are known to be employed on
        conventional airfoils to increase the glide ratio such flaps are
        commonly mounted at the trailing edge of the airfoil. However,
        the use of such flaps on applicants' airfoil is not practical
        due to the relative thinness of said airfoil at its trailing
        edge. Furthermore, the portion of the airfoil downstream of the
        step is not intended to be used for housing auxiliary equipment,
        such as flaps, that would tend to eliminate or markedly reduce
        the aerodynamic effect of the step-like discontinuity. </p>
      <p>During the course of further tests, applicants decided to place
        a lift generating member, such as a flap, adjacent the step-like
        discontinuity of the airfoil. As a general matter, the placement
        of a flap on either the top or lower surface of an airfoil is
        well-known wherein such flaps serve as spoilers to decrease the
        lift and increase the drag. However, contrary to applicants'
        expectation, the placement of a flap adjacent the step-like
        discontinuity of the airfoil produced increased lift when the
        flap was moved to an extended or deflected position in the
        airstream. Thus, applicants have improved their previously
        patented airfoil by incorporating therein lift generating means
        to increase the glide ratio thereof. </p>
      <p>As used herein, the term airfoil is defined as a body, such as
        an airplane wing, designed to provide a desired reaction force
        when in motion relative to the surrounding air. </p>
      <p>Applicants' improved airfoil is to be distinguished from a
        class of airfoils designated as being "supercritical." In this
        regard, all airfoils have a characteristic known as critical
        Mach number (Mcr) which is the air speed ratioed to the speed of
        sound (Mach 1) at which the flow over some portion of the
        airfoil just reaches Mach 1. Airfoils usually are designed to
        fly below their critical Mach number because of the high drag
        rise caused by the formation of shock waves and, possibly, flow
        separation associated with super-critical speeds. However, the
        supercritical airfoil is capable of flying close to the speed of
        sound (Mach 1) without experiencing the high drag rise
        associated with more conventional shapes. </p>
      <p>The conventional airfoil, particularly one designed to operate
        in the subsonic speed range, has cambered surfaces that define a
        profile of gradually decreasing thickness from the leading edge
        to the trailing edge. The supercritical airfoil has a much
        flatter shape of the upper surface thereof which reduces both
        the extent and strength of the shock wave, as well as the
        adverse pressure rise behind the shock wave, with corresponding
        reductions in drag. To compensate for the reduced lift of the
        upper surface of the supercritical airfoil resulting from the
        reduced curvature, the airfoil has increased camber near the
        trailing edge. This is to be distinguished from applicants'
        unique airfoil which has substantially no camber at the trailing
        edge. Furthermore, the supercritical airfoil does not provide
        for any step-like discontinuity as incorporated in applicants'
        airfoil. </p>
      <p>Applicants unique airfoil is also to be distinguished from
        those incorporating leading edge extensions and fences, such as
        shown and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,802,630, dated Aug. 13,
        1957 entitled WING LEADING EDGE DEVICE. The use of such
        extensions apparently has value in the design of sweptback wings
        in obtaining a more perfect airflow over the outboard portion of
        the wing. Applicants' improved airfoil, as will become more
        apparent hereinafter, is directed toward the use of lift
        generating members located in the region of the step-like
        discontinuity to improve the aerodynamic characteristics
        thereof. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The improved airfoil of the present invention provides for a
        first surface extending between the leading and trailing edges
        and a second surface joined to the first surface along the
        leading edge and projecting rearwardly in the direction of the
        trailing edge. The second surface of the airfoil terminates
        materially in advance of the trailing edge to define a step-like
        discontinuity of the airfoil similar to that embodied in
        applicants' previously patented airfoil disclosed in U.S. Pat.
        No. 3,706,430 and referred to above. </p>
      <p>One or more lift generating members, such as flaps, are
        pivotally mounted on the second surface of the airfoil adjacent
        the step-like discontinuity. The lift generating members are
        selectively movable to various positions relative to the
        airstream to alter the aerodynamic forces on the airfoil during
        conditions of flight. </p>
      <p>In another embodiment of the invention, a movable cover member
        is pivotally mounted to the airfoil, and has an outer surface
        extending from the step-like discontinuity to the trailing edge
        of said airfoil. The cover member is selectively movable to
        various positions relative to the second surface to further
        alter the aerodynamic forces acting on the airfoil during
        conditions of flight. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide
        an improved airfoil for aircraft having movable lift generating
        members mounted thereon to improve performance characteristics
        though a wide range of airspeeds. </p>
      <p>Another object and feature of the present invention is to
        provide an improved airfoil for aircraft having lift generating
        members mounted thereon and selectively movable to increase the
        glide ratio. </p>
      <p>The above and other objects, features and advantages of the
        present invention will become more apparent from a full
        consideration of the following detailed description when taken
        in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Referring to the drawings, particularly FIGS. 1,2,3 and 8,
        numeral 10 represents an aircraft having airfoils constructed in
        accordance with the present invention. Aircraft 10 comprises a
        conventional streamlined fuselage 12 with empennage designated
        generally by numeral 14, and sweptback wings 16 and 18 that
        constitute the improved airfoils of the invention. The lateral
        edges of the wings converge toward the rear of the fuselage so
        that as viewed from the bottom, the composite area of the wings
        is of generally diamond configuration as illustrated in FIG. 2.
        However, it will be appreciated that the illustrated
        configuration may be altered and is not to be deemed a
        limitation on the invention. Other conventional portions or
        components of the aircraft, such as the location and type of
        engines, landing gear, etc., are omitted from the drawings for
        the purpose of clarity in that they do not form part of the
        invention. </p>
      <p>The structure and overall general configuration of wings or
        airfoils 16, 18 is essentially similar to that of applicants'
        previously patented airfoil disclosed in U.S. Pat. No.
        3,706,430, and the subject matter thereof is incorporated herein
        by reference. More specifically, and with reference to FIGS. 3 -
        9 herein, the airfoils for any disclosed embodiment of the
        invention extend outwardly from fuselage 12 and are of identical
        construction when viewed in cross section from the leading edge
        to the trailing edge. In other words, the airfoils 16, 18
        associated with the aircraft of FIGS. 1 - 6 are identical in
        construction and the corresponding airfoils associated with the
        aircraft of FIGS. 7 and 8 are also identical in construction.
        However, the respective airfoils of the aircraft in said FIGURES
        represent different embodiments of the invention. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 1 - 6 illustrate one airfoil embodiment 16, 18 of the
        invention. In this regard, since airfoils 16, 18 are identical,
        it will be appreciated that the description and illustration
        relative to one of said airfoils is applicable equally as well
        to the other one of said airfoils. Referring to the FIGURES,
        airfoil 18 is constructed having a first surface 20 extending
        between the leading edge 22 and the trailing edge 24 of the
        airfoil. A second surface 26 is joined to the first surface 20
        along the leading edge 22, and projects rearwardly in the
        direction of trailing edge 24. The arrangement is such that
        surfaces 20 and 26 are in diverging relation to define a
        wedgeshape represented by numeral 28. Second surface 26
        terminates materially in advance of the trailing edge 24 to
        define a steplike discontinuity of the airfoil represented
        generally by numeral 30. The riser portion 32 of step 30 serves
        to connect the second surface 26 of the airfoil to a third
        surface 34 which extends from the step to the trailing edge 24.
        Airfoil 18 has a span-wise dimension defined by the distance
        between its root end 36 and its tip end 38. The step-like
        discontinuity 30 extends span-wise of airfoil 18 and has an end
        edge 40 terminating in advance of the root end 36 of said
        airfoil. This construction permits the wing to have sufficient
        depth or thickness over much of its chord-wise dimension
        adjacent its root end to accomodate the landing gear assembly or
        other auxiliary equipment. </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment, the first surface 20 defines the
        upper contour of airfoil 18 whereas the second and third
        surfaces 26, 34 define the lower contour thereof. The view in
        FIG. 3 shows the upper wing surface, as well as the lower
        surface of the wedge, as being substantially planar.
        Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 2, the lower surfaces of airfoil
        18 merge with the corresponding lower surfaces of airfoil 16
        which project outwardly from the opposite side of fuselage 12. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the teachings of the invention, lift
        generating means, represented generally by numeral 42, are
        provided on the second surface 26 of airfoil 18 adjacent the
        step-like discontinuity 30. Lift generating means 42 is
        preferably a flap-like member 44 pivotally mounted on airfoil 18
        in conventional manner to project rearwardly of the step. Flap
        44 is disposed for movement between a first position in which
        the outer surface 46 forms a smooth continuation of airfoil
        surface 26, a second position in which said outer surface 46
        projects outwardly of said airfoil in the direction away from
        airfoil surface 34, and a third position in which said outer
        surface 46 projects inwardly of said airfoil in the direction
        toward said airfoil surface 34. </p>
      <p>FIG. 4 illustrates flap 44 in its second position corresponding
        to when the flap is moved to an extended position in the
        airstream. FIG. 5 shows the flap 44 disposed for movement
        between its first, second or third positions, which movement is
        represented by the arrow indicia. Although movement of flap 44
        to its third position may serve to reduce any turbulent airflow
        downstream of the wedge by permitting smoother flow over the
        step-like discontinuity 30, the primary importance of flap
        movement is toward its second position which produces increased
        lift thereby improving the glide ratio of applicants' previously
        patented airfoil. Accordingly, the invention herein provides for
        the range of movement of flap 44 from its first position to its
        second position to be greater than the range of movement of said
        flap from its first position to its third position. For example,
        whereas the range of movement of flap 44 from its first position
        to its second position may be in the order of 30.degree., the
        range of movement of said flap from its first position to its
        third position will be in the order of only 10.degree. . </p>
      <p>As is apparent from the drawings, flap 44 is spaced from
        airfoil surface 34 to define an open zone of said airfoil which
        is bounded on three sides by the inner surface of flap 44, the
        riser portion 32 of step 30 and a portion of the airfoil surface
        34. The arrangement is such that the zone is always open
        regardless of whether the flap 44 is in its first position,
        second position or third position. </p>
      <p>The embodiment of FIGS. 1 - 6 provides for the lift generating
        means 42 to comprise a plurality of flap members 44 disposed in
        laterally spaced relation on each of said airfoils 16, 18
        whereby each of said flaps 44 may be selectively disposed for
        movement between their respective positions. In other words, the
        flaps 44 on each airfoil may be operatively connected to move
        separately or in unison, as desired. Thus, for example, as
        viewed in FIG. 3, the inboard flaps 44 may be operatively
        connected to move in unison to their respective second positions
        to improve the glide ratio of the airfoils, whereas the outboard
        flaps 44 may be operatively connected to move separately to a
        selective position relative to the airstream to further alter
        the aerodynamic forces on the airfoils during conditions of
        flight. Accordingly, one or more of the lift generating membes
        may be selectively moved and used in a manner similar to that of
        ailerons to increase the lift on only one of the airfoils, such
        as in executing a bank or turn maneuver of the aircraft. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 7 and 8 disclose another embodiment of the invention
        wherein the improved airfoils are designated by numerals 48 and
        50, each having lift generating means 52 located adjacent the
        step-like discontinuity. In this regard, those portions of
        airfoils 48, 50 which are common to corresponding portions of
        airfoils 16, 18 are designated by the same reference numerals,
        and further description of such correspondingly similar portions
        is not deemed necessary. Lift generating means 52 comprises a
        single flap-like member 54 pivotally mounted in conventional
        manner on the second surface 26 of airfoils 48, 50, and disposed
        to project rearwardly of the step-like discontinuity. The flap
        54 is disposed for movement between positions corresponding to
        those positions previously referred to in connection with the
        lift generating flaps 44 of airfoils 16, 18. Furthermore, as
        shown in FIG. 7, the step-like discontinuity extends span-wise
        of airfoil 48 and has end edges 40, 56 terminating in advance of
        the root end 36 and tip end 38, respectively, of the airfoil. It
        will be appreciated that flaps 54 may be operatively connected
        to move separately or in unison, as desired, in the manner
        similar to that of the corresponding flaps 44 of the embodiment
        of FIGS. 1 - 6. </p>
      <p>FIG. 9 discloses another embodiment of the invention wherein
        the improved airfoil is designated by numeral 58, and is
        constructed having lift generating means 60 in the form of a
        flap-like member 62 pivotally mounted on the second surface 26
        of the airfoil adjacent the step-like discontinuity. Here again,
        those portions of airfoil 58 which are common to corresponding
        portions of airfoils 16, 18 are designated by the same reference
        numerals. However, in this embodiment of the invention, the
        second surface 26 of the airfoil terminates short of the
        steplike discontinuity, and the outer surface 64 of flap 62
        constitutes an extension of said second surface 26 to form the
        terminal end portion thereof. In other words, flap 62 is
        disposed for movement between first and second positions
        corresponding to those positions previously referred to in
        connection with the lift generating flap 44. Thus, when flap 62
        is in its first position, as illustrated by the phantom line
        drawing in FIG. 9, the outer surface 64 forms a smooth
        continuation of the second surface 26 of the airfoil, which
        outer surface 64 extends chord-wise to the step-like
        discontinuity. </p>
      <p>The airfoil embodiment of FIG. 9 further comprises a movable
        cover member 66 pivotally mounted on airfoil 58 adjacent the
        trailing edge 24. Cover 66 has an outer surface 68 that extends
        chord-wise from the step-like discontinuity to the trailing edge
        of the airfoil. Cover member 66 also has a spanwise dimension
        substantially co-extensive with the corresponding span-wise
        dimension of the step-like discontinuity. The cover is disposed
        for movement between a first position, as illustrated by the
        cross-line drawing, in which the outer surface 68 is off-set
        relative to the second surface 26 of the airfoil, and a second
        position, as illustrated by the phantom-line drawing, in which
        the outer surface 68 forms a substantially smooth continuation
        of said airfoil second surface 26 to eliminate the effect of the
        step-like discontinuity. In this regard, there may be instances
        where it is preferable to move the cover member 66 to its second
        position to reduce any turbulent airflow downstream of the wedge
        by permitting smoother flow over the step-like discontinuity. </p>
      <p>The pivotal mounting arrangement for cover 66, as well as for
        the lift generating means 42, 52 and 60, have not been shown in
        detail since such mounting techniques are conventional and
        well-known in the prior art. Furthermore, although the invention
        is shown applied to airfoils of aircraft, it will be appreciated
        that the invention has application as well to other types of
        vehicles having airfoil-like components. Accordingly, there is
        now provided an improved airfoil having lift generating members
        selectively movable to various positions relative to the
        airstream to alter the aerodynamic forces on the airfoil during
        conditions of flight. Furthermore, in another embodiment of the
        invention, a cover member is pivotally mounted on the airfoil
        and is selectively movable to various positions to reduce the
        effect of the step-like discontinuity to further alter the
        aerodynamic forces acting on the airfoil. </p>
      <p>While preferred embodiments of the invention have been shown
        and described in detail, it will be readily understood and
        appreciated that numerous omissions, changes and additions may
        be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the
        present invention. </p>
