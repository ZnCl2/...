      <h3>A Cheap and Simple Cure for Cancer?</h3>

    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      New Scientist has received an unprecedented amount of interest in
      this story from readers. If you would like up-to-date information
      on any plans for clinical trials of DCA in patients with cancer,
      or would like to donate towards a fund for such trials, please
      visit the site set up by the University of Alberta and the Alberta
      Cancer Board (&nbsp; http://www.depmed.ualberta.ca/dca&nbsp; ). We
      will also follow events closely and will report any progress as it
      happens.
      <p>It is rare to find a drug that sweeps away decades of
        assumptions and reveals a radical approach to treating all forms
        of a disease. But a simple, small molecule called
        dichloroacetate (DCA) has done just that - and to that most
        dreaded of diseases: cancer. </p>
      <p>The new findings might also force a rethink on what actually
        causes cells to turn cancerous in the first place. </p>
      <p>In 1930, biochemist Otto Warburg, proposed that cells turn
        cancerous through a fundamental change in the way they generate
        their energy. Normally, cells use specialised organelles called
        mitochondria to supply their energy. Cancer cells shift to a
        process called glycolysis which takes place in the main body of
        the cell. Glycolysis is an inefficient system of making energy
        which normal cells employ only when oxygen is in short supply,
        switching to mitochondrial energy production when oxygen levels
        increase. </p>
      <p>Curiously, Warburg discovered that cancer cells continue to use
        glycolysis even when oxygen is plentiful. He called this the
        “Warburg effect”, and claimed it was common to all cancer cells.
      </p>
      <p>His ideas were dismissed and buried long ago, not least when
        another famous biochemist, Hans Krebs, said the Warburg effect
        was a symptom of cancer, not the primary cause. This scepticism
        was reinforced by the belief that cancer cells switch to
        glycolysis because their mitochondria are damaged and don’t work
        any more. </p>
      <p>Enter DCA, which has been used for years to treat people with
        mitochondrial disease. The drug boosts the ability of
        mitochondria to generate energy. When given to cancer cells it
        did the same: the cells switched from glycolysis to
        mitochondrial energy production. What's more, functional
        mitochondria help cells recognise functional abnormalities and
        trigger cell death. </p>
      <p>In tests, the DCA caused cancer cells to lose their
        “immortality” and die. When the drug was given to rats with
        human tumours, the tumours shrank. Warburg may have been right
        after all - glycolysis may be more than just a symptom of
        cancer. </p>
      <p>So why not rush straight into clinical trials with this drug?
        It is cheap, does not appear to affect normal cells, we know its
        side effects, and it should work on all cancers. </p>
      <p>There's a hitch: dichloroacetate is an old drug and so cannot
        be patented. The upshot is that pharmaceutical companies can’t
        stop rivals making and selling it more cheaply, so it’s not
        worth their while to go to the huge expense of testing it in
        clinical trials. </p>
      <p>This is not a new problem. Many drugs are left on the shelf
        because companies cannot make lots of money from them. It has
        happened for diseases that affect mainly poor people, such as
        TB, although there are now an increasing number of initiatives
        to help deal with these cases. But cancer is historically a
        disease that chiefly afflicts the rich, and testing DCA will
        need a one-off effort. </p>
      <p>Drugs companies will be falling over themselves to find a
        patentable drug with similar action to DCA. Any of these that
        reach the market will be hugely expensive. It would be a scandal
        if a cheap alternative with such astonishing potential were not
        given a chance simply because it won't turn a big enough profit.</p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Mitochondria Activation Reduces Cancer</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A small molecule activates suppressed mitochondria in cancer
        cells and the cells start acting normal. </p>
      <p>January 16, 2007 - Edmonton - DCA is an odourless, colourless,
        inexpensive, relatively non-toxic, small molecule. And
        researchers at the University of Alberta believe it may soon be
        used as an effective treatment for many forms of cancer. </p>
      <p>One qualifier to the above statement: Whether dichloroacetate
        (DCA) would really be non-toxic when used in therapeutic doses
        against cancer remains to be seen. When used to treat a genetic
        disorder involving high lactic acid DCA caused peripheral
        neuropathy. DCA inhibits a kinase enzyme that deactivates an
        enzyme called pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) which is involved in
        mitochondrial metabolism (i.e, it is involved in sugar breakdown
        to make energy). </p>
      <p>Dr. Evangelos Michelakis, a professor at the U of A Department
        of Medicine, has shown that dichloroacetate (DCA) causes
        regression in several cancers, including lung, breast and brain
        tumors. </p>
      <p>Michelakis and his colleagues, including post-doctoral fellow
        Dr. Sebastian Bonnet, have published the results of their
        research in the journal Cancer Cell. </p>
      <p>Many cancer cells do not break sugar down completely. They just
        do a step called glycolysis. They do not do a step called the
        Krebs cycle (aka the citric acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid
        cycle or TCA cycle) which extracts all the energy out of sugar
        molecules to make energy carrier molecules called NADH and ATP.
        This was first observed about cancer all the way back in the
        1930s. Up until now the assumption to explain this was that
        cancer cells lost that ability. But this result suggests that
        not only do cancer cells suppress that ability but that
        suppression helps them grow uncontrollably. </p>
      <p>Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) synthesizes acetyl-CoA which is
        used in the first step of the TCA cycle in mitochondria. If DCA
        has either toxicity problems or problems with achieving
        sufficient doses that does not defeat this approach to
        anti-cancer drug development. The kinase that DCA blocks could
        become a target for drug development. A drug that would disable
        that kinase would likely activate mitochondria in cancer cells
        just like DCA does. </p>
      <p>I remember a scientist telling me decades ago that classic
        intermediary metabolism doesn't get the attention it deserves
        because everyone was rushing into genetics. Many scientists
        decided that there was little of interest left to learn from
        studying the main pathways of energy metabolism. This result
        argues for his view. How can we get all the way to the year 2007
        without noticing sooner the powerful results from a simple long
        known molecule? </p>
      <p>Michelakis decided the conventional wisdom on cancer and
        mitochondria might be wrong and decided to test it. </p>
      <p>Until recently, researchers believed that cancer-affected
        mitochondria are permanently damaged and that this damage is the
        result, not the cause, of the cancer. But Michelakis, a
        cardiologist, questioned this belief and began testing DCA,
        which activates a critical mitochondrial enzyme, as a way to
        "revive" cancer-affected mitochondria. </p>
      <p>The results astounded him. </p>
      <p>Michelakis and his colleagues found that DCA normalized the
        mitochondrial function in many cancers, showing that their
        function was actively suppressed by the cancer but was not
        permanently damaged by it. </p>
      <p>More importantly, they found that the normalization of
        mitochondrial function resulted in a significant decrease in
        tumor growth both in test tubes and in animal models. Also, they
        noted that DCA, unlike most currently used chemotherapies, did
        not have any effects on normal, non-cancerous tissues. </p>
      <p>No one single molecule is going to cure all cancers by itself.
        But combinations of compounds that each toxicity highly specific
        to cancer cells will certainly end up curing a great many
        cancers. Monoclonal antibodies targetted at cancers,
        anti-angiogenesis compounds that block blood vessel growth in
        cancers, gene therapies that activate in cancer cells and
        assorted other compounds such as DCA are going to cure many
        cancers when used in combination. </p>
      <p>"I think DCA can be selective for cancer because it attacks a
        fundamental process in cancer development that is unique to
        cancer cells," Michelakis said. "Cancer cells actively suppress
        their mitochondria, which alters their metabolism, and this
        appears to offer cancer cells a significant advantage in growth
        compared to normal cells, as well as protection from many
        standard chemotherapies. Because mitochondria regulate cell
        death - or apoptosis - cancer cells can thus achieve resistance
        to apoptosis, and this appears to be reversed by DCA." </p>
      <p>The suppression of mitochondria might be a way for cancer cells
        to divide in low oxygen environments found deep in tumors
        lacking in sufficient vasculature. By turning on mitochondria in
        these cells their need for oygen is probably increased and that
        likely contributes to their death. This suggests that DCA might
        work well in combination with anti-angiogenesis drugs since the
        ability of anti-angiogenesis drugs to block blood vessel growth
        will decrease the amount of oxygen available to tumors and
        therefore make more cells in tumors susceptible to the effects
        of DCA. </p>
      <p>DCA (aka Ceresine) has a big problem: It is not patentable and
        hence provides little incentive for commercial companies to
        raise money to fund clinical studies to develop it as an
        anti-cancer drug. People who are philosophically opposed to
        patents ought to take note of this. </p>
      <p>Furthermore, the DCA compound is not patented or owned by any
        pharmaceutical company, and, therefore, would likely be an
        inexpensive drug to administer, Michelakis added. </p>
      <p>However, as DCA is not patented, Michelakis is concerned that
        it may be difficult to find funding from private investors to
        test DCA in clinical trials. He is grateful for the support he
        has already received from publicly funded agencies, such as the
        Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), and he is
        hopeful such support will continue and allow him to conduct
        clinical trials of DCA on cancer patients. </p>
      <p>If DCA is on the market in less regulated countries then maybe
        it'll get tried out in human cancer patients under less
        restrictive regulatory regimes. </p>
      <p>DCA hasn't been tried yet in humans against cancer. </p>
      <p>Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta in Edmonton,
        Canada, and his colleagues tested DCA on human cells cultured
        outside the body and found that it killed lung, breast and brain
        cancer cells, but not healthy cells. Tumours in rats
        deliberately infected with human cancer also shrank drastically
        when they were fed DCA-laced water for several weeks. </p>
      <p>People who have fatal diseases should be allowed to try
        anything as a treatment. </p>

      <p>Almost two years ago my aunt died from ovarian cancer. At age
        53, she was younger than my mother and, the last time I saw her,
        I remember her producing a pile of computer print-outs of
        alternative cancer therapies she had read about on the internet.
        She was desperate, and she wanted my advice on whether the
        science behind their claims was robust or not. After examining
        the literature, it was with great sadness that I told her that,
        in my opinion, their claims were unfounded. </p>
      <p>Pouring cold water on someone’s hopes is a terrible thing. In
        the case of DCA, I have to say there are at least some grounds
        for excitement. Lab studies have shown that it can kill cancer
        cells by reactivating mitochondria, which will then recognise a
        cell as cancerous and destroy it. But until we see whether this
        mechanism applies to cells in the human body it is impossible to
        know whether it will work in human cancer. </p>
      <p>We also have no idea of the doses that could produce this
        effect; of their side effects in cancer patients, or about
        whether DCA interacts with existing cancer medications. DCA is
        not a harmless drug – as Lawrence Burgh’s example illustrates,
        it can have side effects. Fortunately, Burgh is a physician
        whose oncologist was aware that he was taking DCA. He was taking
        supplements to try and reduce side effects, and at the first
        sign of trouble, he stopped taking it. </p>
      <p>Not everyone who is experimenting with DCA is so cautious.
        Self-medicating with DCA could cause nerve or liver damage, and
        perhaps even death. People with terminal cancer may feel that
        they have nothing to lose – but there may be a different option.
      </p>
      <p>Statistically speaking, if a cancer drug has passed initial
        safety tests in phase 1 clinical trials, it has a one in 20
        chance of being approved. If it has passed phase 2 trials (the
        stage before large scale trials in patients with the disease) it
        has a one in 5 chance of being approved. Yet doctors are
        struggling to recruit patients into these trials. In the US,
        fewer than 5% of adult cancer patients are enrolled. True, not
        everyone can take part in clinical trials because they have
        other physical ailments, their insurance companies won’t cover
        them, or because they live too far away from trial centres. But
        it seems at least worth trying, before opting for the
        ultra-gamble of DCA. </p>
      <p>Sadly, many of the posts I came across while researching the
        DCA site, expressed a feeling that their doctors didn’t care –
        that they were made to feel like “dead men walking”. I’m sure
        that most doctors do their utmost to listen to their patients
        concerns, but for those who fall through the net, it should be
        noted that website communities seem to be filling a gap in
        providing at least some of the comfort, support, and hope that
        impersonal hospital visits may lack. </p>
      <p>When this drives people to campaign for a drug like DCA to be
        put through clinical trials, or to push doctors to try the
        latest approved drugs, this can be a great thing. But people
        should treat what they read on the internet with care. There is
        a risk that these forums could push an already vulnerable person
        to make their shortened life even more painful. </p>
      <p>So what is the answer in a situation like this? Should patients
        have the ultimate say in how they choose to treat their own
        bodies; or should these most vulnerable of people be protected
        from the exploitative promises of untried therapies? </p>

        <p><b>Illegal 'cancer drug' website shut down</b></p>
      </center>
      27 July 2007 <br>
      NewScientist.com news service <br>
      by Linda Geddesdca
      <p>"Is DCA worth trying? We absolutely think so," proclaimed a
        website promoting the laboratory chemical sodium dichloroacetate
        (DCA) as a treatment for cancer earlier this year. </p>
      <p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearly did not
        agree. Last week it visited the site's owners and told them to
        stop making and selling DCA from a sister website, or face
        criminal prosecution. </p>
      <p>Jim Tassano of Sonora, California, claims to have sold DCA to
        more than 2000 people, with no reports of serious side effects,
        via his website www.buydca.com. </p>
      <p>However, on the 17 July he posted the following message on the
        site. "Two agents from the FDA visited us today and ordered that
        we stop making and selling DCA. Unfortunately, the site
        www.buydca.com will be shut down. It is against US government
        law to sell substances with the suggestion that they are cancer
        treatments unless they are approved by the FDA. DCA can still be
        obtained from pharmacies with a prescription and from chemical
        companies." </p>
      <p>The FDA confirmed that agents from their Office of Criminal
        Investigations had visited Tassano, but declined to comment
        further. </p>
      <p><b>'Improvements reported'</b> </p>
      <p>In an interview with New Scientist, Tassano told us: "We've
        seen cancers where it doesn't seem to respond at all [to DCA],
        but a lot of people have reported improvements in their
        symptoms." </p>
      <p>"I'm disappointed [that the FDA has shut the website down], but
        not surprised. It is an unapproved cancer treatment and we have
        become very high profile. I guess the pressure has got to be too
        much for the FDA," he said. </p>
      <p>Tassano continues to host discussions on the supposed virtues
        of the chemical, which has not yet undergone human trials as a
        cancer therapy, on his original site www.thedcasite.com. </p>
      <p>Researchers studying DCA as a potential cancer drug welcomed
        the FDA's action. "The FDA is doing the absolutely right thing
        to help protect vulnerable cancer patients from the unregulated
        use of a drug that should be studied in properly designed
        clinical studies," says Chi Van Dang at Johns Hopkins University
        Medical School in Baltimore, Maryland, US. </p>
      <p><b>Worrying reports</b> </p>
      <p>Kate Law, Cancer Research UK's clinical trial director, agrees:
        "Reports of people buying personal supplies of DCA from sources
        such as the internet were very worrying." </p>
      <p>"It is important that all new treatments are carefully
        investigated to make sure they are effective and safe for use in
        patients. DCA is no exception, so we are pleased that the FDA
        has taken the decisive action to limit the sale of DCA over the
        internet," she says. </p>
      <p>Clinical trials of DCA are expected to take place in the near
        future. Evangelos Michelakis of the University of Alberta in
        Edmonton has just resubmitted protocols to Health Canada, and
        hopes to gain approval to for a safety trial of DCA in human
        cancer patients in the coming weeks. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Van Dang has just received notice of funding to
        carry out additional studies of DCA in animals with cancer, with
        the intention of conducting clinical trials in lymphoma patients
        within three years. </p>
