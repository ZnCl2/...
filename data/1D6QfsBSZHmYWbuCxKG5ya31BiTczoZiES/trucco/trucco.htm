      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      The intermittent internal combustion engines, as known today, can
      be divided into two basic categories; (a) the spark ignited, or
      gasoline engine and (b) the compression ignition, or Diesel
      engine. Each type of engine requires a different fuel which
      properties are very specific; the spark ignited engine calls,
      among others, for a fuel with relative high volatility and high
      "octane number" while the Diesel engine requires fuel with
      relatively low viscosity and high "cetane number". Because this
      rather narrow and precise required fuel properties the percentage
      of motor fuel obtainable from crude oil is relatively low. Today
      engine designers are looking for new ways that will make it
      possible to utilize lower quality fuels in these engines, because
      it will increase the yield of useful motor fuel obtainable from
      petroleum. In addition, if we consider the vast resources of
      non-petroleum liquid fuels available to use plus the possibility
      to produce inexpensive synthetic liquid fuels, and coal-liquid
      slurries that cannot be utilized in present types of internal
      combustion engines, it is obvious that a new type of engine that
      could efficiently accept these low grade fuels will immediately
      find its way in the motor vehicle, and power plant market reducing
      the nations dependence on imported crude oil while creating the
      need for domestic produced alternate fuels and utilizing our
      immense coal resources.<br>
      <br>
      This invention can easily be incorporated into any type of
      intermittent internal combustion engine as known today and can
      immediately be utilized in automobile and transportation engines
      effecting a drastic reduction in the nation petroleum consumption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SPECIFICATION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is the object of this invention to provide intermittent
      internal combustion engines with a mean to vaporize a liquid fuel
      or slurry fuel prior to its mixing with the combustion air. It is
      a further object of this invention to append a vaporizer chamber
      interconnected to the conventional combustion chamber of said
      engine through a valve that can be opened and closed as required.
      It is a further object of this invention to provide said vaporizer
      and combustion chambers with a multiplicity of fuel injectors and
      spark plugs such as to obtain a controllable and dependable
      combustion with most liquid fuels and slurry fuels regardless of
      its octane or cetane rating, its volatility, its viscosity and
      similar properties required by the spark ignited and/or Diesel
      engine. It is still a further object of this invention to achieve
      combustion inside said engines resulting in low and acceptable
      emission indexes for carbon monoxide (CO), oxides of nitrogen
      (NOx), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC) particulate matter and soot.<br>

      In describing the embodiments of this invention illustrated in the
      drawings specific terminology will be used for the sake of
      clarity. However, it is not intended to be limited to the specific
      terms so selected and is to be understood that each specific term
      includes all technical equivalents which operate in a similar
      manner to accomplish a similar purpose.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred embodiment of this invention illustrated in FIG.
      1, an internal combustion engine, partially shown, is seen to
      consist of a piston 1, shown near to its top dead center (TDC),
      connecting rod 2, cylinder 3, piston rings 4, intake valve 5,
      exhaust valve not shown, camshaft 6, a multiplicity of cams 7, a
      multiplicity of valve tappets 8, acting on push rods 9 that cause
      rocker arms 10 to actuate said intake and exhaust valves in
      accordance to a four-stroke cycle, a conventional combustion
      chamber 11, a vaporizer chamber 12 interconnected to said
      conventional combustion chamber through a passage 13, a vaporizer
      valve 14, shown in the open position, valve stems 15, valve guide
      16, vaporizer rocker arm 17, mechanically contacting valve locks
      18, spring retainer 19, valve spring 20, spring bracket 21,
      attached to cylinder head 22 through a multiplicity of points 23,
      a push rod 24, actuated by said camshaft and said valve tappet
      such as to open or close said vaporizer valve by the combined
      action of rocker arm 17 and valve spring 20, a spark (or glow)
      plug 25 reaching said vaporizer chamber, a spark (or glow) plug 26
      reaching said conventional combustion chamber, a fuel injector 27
      penetrating into said vaporizer chamber, a secondary fuel injector
      28 penetrating into said conventional combustion chamber, a leak
      collecting plenum 29, a passage 30 connecting said plenum to
      intake duct through orifice 31.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, a fresh charge of air (or gaseous oxidizer)
      containing no fuel is drawn, without throttling, into cylinder 3
      during the downstroke of piston 1 while intake valve is open but
      exhaust valve and vaporizer valve 14 are closed, during the
      following upstroke of piston 1 the charge of air is compressed,
      all valves are closed, thus increasing its temperature and
      pressure. Before piston 1 reaches its TDC vaporizer valve 14
      opens. Assume the vaporizer chamber 12 is filled with vaporized
      fuel which temperature and pressure is "higher" than the levels
      for the compressed charge of air, when vaporizer valve 14 opens
      the fuel vapors will transfer from vaporizer chamber 12 into
      conventional combustion chamber 11 mixing with the compressed air
      in all gaseous phase, at this point spark plug 26 delivers a spark
      that ignites the vaporized fuel-compressed air mixture
      establishing a diffusion flame. It is important to realize that
      because the fuel is vaporized and it is at a temperature
      sufficiently high for autoignition there is not ignition delay
      involved in the initiation of the chemical reaction, and in
      addition because the gaseous state of the fuel the flame front is
      only controlled by its mixing rate. The important advantage of
      this new type of internal combustion engine is that any type of
      liquid fuel or slurry fuel, regardless of its cetane index will
      instantly ignite and thereafter sustain a vigorous, but smooth,
      combustion characterized by a noise-free operation of the eninge.
      An added advantage is that a diffusion flame from gaseous mixtures
      cannot detonate thus eliminating the need for octane rated fuel.
      The combustion phase continues while piston 1 reaches its TDC and
      during a part of the following downstroke that delivers mechanical
      power to the engine crankshaft. At a selected point during this
      expansion phase of the cycle the vaporizer valve 14 closes
      entrapping inside vaporizer chamber 12 hot combustion products
      gases. After vaporizer valve 14 closes piston 1 continues the
      expansion phase of the cycle, followed by the opening of the
      exhaust valve and the exhausting of combustion products during the
      next upstroke of piston 1 completing a four-stroke cycle. Notice
      that after vaporizer valve 14 closes the entrapped combustion
      products cannot expand so they maintain its relative high level of
      pressure and temperature. At a desired point after vaporizer valve
      14 was closed fuel injector 27 sprays liquid fuel or slurry fuel
      into vaporizer chamber 12. The fuel spray absorbs heat by direct
      mixing with the entrapped combustion products vaporizing at a
      finite rate. Now the vaporizer chamber contains a mixture of
      combustion products and vaporized fuel. Notice that the entrapped
      combustion products contain insignificant amounts of oxygen (or
      oxidizer), consequently the injected fuel cannot burn inside
      vaporizer chamber 12. The vaporized fuel is now ready to be
      transferred into conventional combustion chamber 11 at the
      opportune time to repeat the cycle described above. Small amounts
      of vaporized fuel that will leak through valve stem 15 are
      collected in chamber 29 from where it is recirculated back into
      the cylinder via passage 30 and orifice 31 during an intake phase
      of a cycle.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 is a pressure-volume diagram of the cycle described above,
      solid lines represent the pressure variation inside combustion
      chamber 11 and dashed lines represent the pressure variation
      inside vaporizer chamber 12. Arrows indicate the event direction
      as cycle progress. From point "a" to point "b" the unthrottled
      induction of a fresh charge of air takes place, from point "b" to
      point "c" the air is compressed while all valves are closed, at
      point "c" vaporizer valve 14 opens allowing to vent the contents
      of vaporizer chamber 12 into conventional combustion chamber 11
      through orifice 13. Immediately after, at point "d" a spark
      supplied by spark plug 26 ignites the mixture of vaporized fuel
      and compressed air. The pressure inside combustion chamber 11
      rapidly increases due to the combustion and the moving of piston 1
      travelling toward its TDC. The pressure inside vaporizer chamber
      12 initially decreases due to the venting, at point "e" it is
      approximately equal to the pressure level inside combustion
      chamber 11. Because the volume of combustion chamber 11 continues
      to decrease, but the volume of vaporizer chamber 12 is fixed, the
      flame front established inside combustion chamber 11 will move
      back into vaporized chamber with a reverse (or inverted) diffusion
      flame. After piston 1 reaches its TDC, the common pressure inside
      combustion and vaporizer chambers peaks at point "f". During the
      expansion phase from point "f" to point "h" the vaporizer valve 14
      closes at a intermediate point "g" entrapping hot combustion
      products inside vaporized chamber 12. Notice that, while the
      engine cycle evolves from point "e" through point "g", vaporizer
      chamber 12 and conventional combustion chamber 11 both in
      combination determine the boundary of the "actual" combustion
      chamber. The bulk of the combustion products continues the cycle
      dictated by the displacement of piston 1, from point "h" to point
      "a" the exhaust phase completes the fourth stroke of the cycle.
      Going back to point "g" notice that the relatively high pressure
      and temperature prevailing inside vaporizer chamber remains
      approximately constant until when at point "j" liquid fuel or
      slurry fuel is injected inside the vaporizer chamber 12, the
      liquid fuel droplets and particles absorb heat by direct mixing
      with the entrapped hot combustion products. As a result vaporizer
      chamber walls. As a result the injected fuel vaporizes and
      superheats. Notice that the residence time available for
      vaporization includes the cycle evolution time point "j" through
      points "k", "m", "n" and finally point "c" when vaporizer valve 14
      opens. Point "j" was selected to emphasize the relative long
      residence time available for the injected fuel to vaporize.
      Depending on the particular fuel utilized, point "j" can be
      shifted to a later time before point "c" is reached. Notice that
      the combustion process described above occurs in the presence of
      some inert combustion product from the previous cycle, its
      chemistry is similar to the one in exhaust gas recirculation
      technique widely used for NOx reduction of internal combustion
      engines. Furthermore a fully vaporized fuel, below stoichiometric
      fuel-air ratio combust with minimum emission of UHC, CO, soot and
      smoke.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a pressure-volume diagram obtainable with the present
      invention that differs from the one shown in FIG. 2 as described
      below. At point "c" when vaporizer valve 14 opens the pressure
      prevailing inside vaporizer chamber 12 is "lower" than the
      pressure inside conventional combustion chamber 11, consequently
      fresh compressed air (or oxidizer) is transferred into vaporizer
      chamber 12, at point "d" spark plug 25 supplies a spark that
      ignites the air-vaporized fuel mixture establishing a reverse
      diffusion flame. Notice that spark plug 25 does not contribute to
      the vaporization process that takes place while cycle evolves from
      point "j" through point "c". At point "f" when most of the
      vaporized fuel had been consumed a secondary amount of liquid fuel
      or slurry fuel is sprayed by secondary fuel injector 28, inside
      combustion chamber 11 where a fraction of the initial fresh charge
      of air is still available, since its temperature at this point is
      much higher than the one normally obtainable in a Diesel engine
      the additional secondary fuel injected will easily ignite and burn
      with a diffusion flame much like in a Diesel engine regardless of
      its cetane rating.<br>
      <br>
      The flexibility of secondary fuel injection utilizing secondary
      fuel injector 28 also applies to the case of the cycle described
      by FIG. 2. The effect of secondary fuel injection is better shown
      in FIG. 4 where the dashed line indicates the effect of such
      secondary fuel injection.<br>
      <br>
      Power is controlled, like in a Diesel engine, by metering the
      total amount of fuel injected to each cycle since the aspirated
      amount of fresh air is nonthrottled.<br>
      <br>
      Cold starting this engine can be achieved in various manners
      depending upon the properties of the fuel utilized. Fuel with
      light viscosity and high volativity can be initially injected into
      the vaporizer chamber 12 to obtain ignition with assistance of a
      spark, after engine has warmed up, usually a few seconds, a much
      heavier fuel can be utilized for injection into vaporizer chamber
      12 and thus achieve the vaporization described above. A second
      alternative is to externally preheat the walls of the vaporizer
      chamber 12, with this technique the engine will cold start
      utilizing heavier fuels. A third alternative is to temporarily mix
      fuel with the intaking air alike in a spark ignited engine and to
      run the engine in this mode, until it warms up and then initiates
      the fuel injection into vaporizer chamber 12.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is an embodiment showing a cross-sectional view of a rotary
      piston engine constructed in accordance with this invention, seen
      to consist of a rotor 32, a casing 33, an intake port 34, an
      exhaust port 35, a conventional combustion comber 11, vaporizer
      chamber 12 interconnected to said conventional combustion chamber
      through a passage 13, a vaporizer valve 14, vaporizer rocker arm
      17, valve spring 20, spring bracket 21 attached to said engine
      casing (not shown), a push rod 24, actuated by a cam and tappet
      mechanism (not shown), a spark plug 26 reaching said conventional
      combustion chamber, a fuel injector 27 penetrating into said
      vaporizer chamber, a secondary fuel injector 28 penetrating into
      said combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, a fresh charge of air is drawn through intake port
      34 and a four-stroke cycle as described in FIG. 2 or 4 takes place
      exhausting its combustion products through port 35.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is an embodiment showing in cross-sectional view a
      two-stroke piston engine constructed in accordance to this
      invention, seen to consist of a piston 1, cylinder 3, provided
      with intake transfer port 36 and exhaust port 37, a conventional
      combustion chamber 11, a vaporizer chamber 12 interconnected to
      said conventional combustion chamber through passage 13, a
      vaporizer valve 14, vaporizer rocker arm 17, valve spring 20,
      spring bracket 21 attached to cylinder head at a multiplicity of
      points 23, a cam 38 acting on said vaporizer rocker arm, a spark
      plug 26 reaching said conventional combustion chamber, a fuel
      injector 27 penetrating into said vaporizer chamber.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, a fresh charge of air is drawn through intake
      transfer port 36, while exhausting the combustion products from
      previous cycle through port 37. It is easier to realize that a
      pressure-volume diagram similar to the one shown in FIG. 2 applies
      to this two-stroke engine. Notice that in both cases of FIG. 5 and
      FIG. 6 only one spark plug is necessary to obtain controllable
      combustion, and that said spark plug 26 is placed "outside"
      vaporizer chamber 12. The embodiment of FIG. 1, because it has two
      spark plugs, can operate either pressure-volume diagram as shown
      in FIG. 2 or FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      It will be obvious to those skilled in this art that the invention
      described above is applicable to any type of intermittent internal
      combustion engine, and that, any valving mechanism that will
      perform the above described function vaporizer valve 14 can be
      utilized in conjunction with any mechanism or combination of
      mechanisms that will control the opening and closing of said
      vaporizer valve without modifying the intent of this invention.<br>
      <br>
      Various changes and variations may be made without departing from
      the spirit of this invention and the scope thereof as defined in
      the following claims.<br>
