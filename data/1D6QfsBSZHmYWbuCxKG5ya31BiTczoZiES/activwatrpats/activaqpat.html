          Rather, the magnetic field restructures the water clusters (
          with varying stability ), but the water is not itself
          magnetic. If you want the water to be "magnetic" when you
          drink it, attach magnets to the glass and drink from that. ]<br>

          The invention relates to a water activating method and device
          by combination of an acoustic field/magnetic field and vortex.
          Water or water with one or more beneficial substances flows
          through a vortex generator and an acoustic field and magnetic
          field, makes a centripetal vortex motion and is discharged,
          thereby forming microcluster activated water. The vortex
          generator is a funnel-shaped structure formed by connecting a
          main body container and a vortex tube, wherein the cross
          section of the main body container is circular, and the
          circumference is provided with a tangential side feed port;
          the vortex tube has a bigger upper end and a smaller lower
          end, and the cross section is circular; the bottom end of the
          vortex tube is a discharge port; an acoustic field generator
          is arranged in the main body container; and a magnetic field
          generator is arranged around the vortex tube or main body
          container. Water makes a centripetal vortex flow in the vortex
          tube and is coherent with vacuum zero point energy to generate
          a centripetal vortex internal pressure energy filed, and the
          field acts on the water to open the original water
          macrocluster in the water and regenerate new stable
          microcluster water; and the combined action of the acoustic
          field and the magnetic field enhances the activation
          efficiency and stability.<br>

          The invention relates to a water activating method and device
          by combination of an acoustic field/electromagnetic
          field/magnetic field and double-vortex-body vortex. Water or
          water with one or more beneficial substances flows through a
          double-vortex-body device and an acoustic field,
          electromagnetic field and magnetic field, makes a
          double-vortex-body centripetal vortex motion and is discharged
          from the lower end, thereby forming microcluster activated
          water. The double-vortex-body is formed by connecting a main
          body container and a spiral double-vortex-body vortex tube,
          wherein an acoustic field generator and an electromagnetic
          field generator are arranged in the main body container, and a
          magnetic field generator is arranged around a
          double-vortex-body vortex generator. The fluid water forms a
          double-vortex-body centripetal vortex motion in the
          double-vortex-body vortex tube and is coherent with vacuum
          zero point energy to form a double-vortex-body centripetal

          fluid flowing through the double-vortex-body vortex tube to
          form better activated water. The acoustic field,

          The water structuring device is composed of a spirally bent
          tube (4.1), the inner spiral lamella (4.2) and the magnets
          (4.4) of appropriate shapes and characteristics, fitted into
          the magnet holders (4.3) located at any position on the spiral
          tube (8.2), wherein the spiral lamella (6.1) is inserted in
          the tube prior to its bending and the resulting tube-inner
          lamella assembly is bent into a desired shape of the spirally
          bent tube (4.1), in which the inner spiral lamella (4.2) is
          inserted. The spirally bent tube (4.1), subject to the given
          parameters of the device, may have either shape (5.1) or (5.2)
          of a three-dimensional spiral, varying in respect to x, y and
          z axes, wherein the length and the diameter of the spirally
          bent tube (4.1) as well as the number and shape of its curves
          may vary, and the curves of the spirally bent tube (4.1) may
          have equal or different diameters. Component parts of the
          water structuring device are also the magnet holders, composed
          of the magnet holder body (9.1) or (10.1), opening (9.2) or

          principle that the unstructured water, after entering the
          device through the inlet (4.5) at a pressure of not less than
          0.5 bar, flows through the spirally bent tube (4.1) whereby

          and spiral flow along the spirally bent lamella (7.1) which is

          whirling combined with simultaneous multiple increase of the
          path travelled by water molecules within a given period of
          time. In addition to the kinetic energy, such water is also
          exposed to the influence of the magnetic field of a certain
          strength, achieved by means of the permanent magnets (4.4) of
          any discretionally chosen number and size, fitted into the

          to divide both liquids into fine particles and passing the

          charged into a first storage chamber 3 and introduced into the
          straight pipe 5 and spiral pipe 7 extending along the center
