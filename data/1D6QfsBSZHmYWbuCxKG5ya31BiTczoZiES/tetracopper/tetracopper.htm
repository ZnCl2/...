            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0003] The present invention relates to electron active
          compounds and compositions that have polyvalent cations in
          their crystal lattices. In addition, the present invention
          also includes a method of making such electron active
          compounds. The present invention also relates to methods for
          the prevention, treatment, or management of conditions, or
          symptoms thereof, by administering one or more such compounds
          or compositions.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0004] Tetrasilver tetroxide has been demonstrated to possess
          unique properties arising from electrostatic concepts of metal
          cation interaction. Such silver molecules have also been
          disclosed for various uses, as they are reported to be
          non-toxic to animals and humans. M. Antelman, "Anti-Pathogenic
          Multivalent Silver Molecular Semiconductors," Precious Metals,
          vol. 16:141-149 (1992); M. Antelman, "Multivalent Silver
          Bactericides," Precious Metals, vol. 16:151-163 (1992). For
          example, tetrasilver tetroxide activated with an oxidizing
          agent is disclosed for use in bactericidal, fungicidal, and
          algicidal use, such as in municipal and industrial water
          treatment applications and for the treatment of AIDS.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] A variety of sources also report the use of certain
          divalent silver compounds for water treatment, as well as the
          use of such compounds, typically in combination with certain
          oxidizing agents, metals, or other compounds, as
          disinfectants, bactericides, algicides, and fungicides. One
          source also reports a single in vitro study of the use of such
          compounds for the treatment of AIDS. These sources include M.
          Antelman, "Silver (II, III) Disinfectants,"
          Soap/Cosmetics/Chemical Specialties, pp. 52-59 (Mar., 1994),
          and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,017,295; 5,073,382; 5,078,902; 5,089,275;
          5,098,582; 5,211,855; 5,223,149; 5,336,416; and 5,772,896.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] U.S. Patent No. 5,336,499 discloses tetrasilver
          tetroxide and persulfate compositions having certain in vitro
          anti-pathogenic properties, i.e., bactericidal, fungicidal,
          viricidal, and algicidal, in certain concentrations as low as
          0.3 ppm, particularly in nutrient broth cultures. The
          persulfate is disclosed as being an oxidizing agent that
          activates the tetroxide crystals. Also disclosed are an in
          vitro study regarding the inhibition of yeast growth in
          nutrient broth and the formulation of a gynecological cream
          and douche based on these results, and a report of an in vitro
          AIDS test with the compositions indicating total suppression
          of the virus at 18 ppm.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,520 discloses the use of molecular
          crystals of tetrasilver tetroxide, particularly with oxidizing
          agents to enhance the efficiency of such devices, for killing
          pathogenic microorganisms, such as staph infections. Amounts
          of 10 ppm sodium persulfate as an oxidizing agent were used
          with certain amounts of silver tetroxide in the reported in
          vitro testing. One human study involved in vivo curing of a
          gynecological yeast infection with 10 ppm of the silver
          tetroxide and 40 ppm sodium persulfate. Other in vivo topical
          studies report in conclusory fashion the cure of a single case
          of athlete's foot with a solution of 100 ppm of the
          composition and the cure of a single case of toenail fungus
          with a 25% suspension of the composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,977 discloses intraveneously
          injected tetrasilver tetroxide crystals used for destroying
          the AIDS virus, AIDS synergistic pathogens, and immunity
          suppressing moieties (ISM) in humans. The crystals were
          formulated for a single injection at about 40 ppm of human
          blood. This reference also discloses the compositions cause
          hepatomegaly, also known as enlarged liver, albeit with no
          reported loss of liver function.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The aforementioned references report detailed
          descriptions of the mechanism via which the multivalent silver
          molecular crystal devices were believed to operate. A
          discussion of such results and concepts was presented at a
          Seminar entitled "Incurable Diseases Update" (Weizmann
          Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, Feb. 11, 1998). The
          title of this presentation was "Beyond Antibiotics, Non Toxic
          Disinfectants and Tetrasil(TM) (a composition including
          tetrasilver tetroxide)." In this paper, it was reported that
          the effects of the electron transfer involved with respect to
          the tetroxide, rendered it a more powerful germicide than
          other silver entities. Other patents cover multivalent silver
          antimicrobial compositions, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,295 for
          Ag(II) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,149 for Ag (III). These are
          stronger antimicrobial agents than Ag (I) compounds, but they
          pale by comparison to tetrasilver tetroxide. Likewise,
          colloidal silver that derives its germicidal properties from
          trace silver (I) ions it generates in various environments is
          also less effective. Accordingly, the oligodynamic properties
          of these entities may be summarized as follows, which is
          referred to as the Horsfal series:<br>
          <br>
          [0010] Ag4O4&gt;Ag(III)&gt;Ag(II)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ag(I)<br>
          <br>
          [0011] Another property of the tetrasilver tetroxide is that
          it does not stain organic matter such as skin in like manner
          as Ag(I) compounds do. In addition, it is light stable.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] Further, synthetic routes for making Bi(III,V) oxide
          are detailed and reviewed in Gmelins Handbuch DerAnorganischen
          Chemie, vol. 16:642 (1964). Also, Co(II,III) oxide, Fe(II,III)
          oxide, Mn(II,III) oxide, and Pr(III,IV) oxide can all be found
          in nature. These five multivalent metal oxides are also all
          available commercially.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] In view of the beneficial properties of tetrasilver
          tetroxide, it could be desirable to find other medicinal uses
          for this compound, as well as to discover other electron
          active metal oxides that provide similar properties.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0014] The present invention relates to pharmaceutical
          compositions that include a therapeutically effective amount
          of at least one electron active compound, or a
          pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, that has at
          least two polyvalent cations, at least one of which has a
          first valence state and at least one of which has a second,
          different valence state. Advantageously, the pharmaceutical
          composition may have antipathogenic efficacy. Preferably, the
          at least one electron active compound includes a metal oxide.
          In one embodiment, the metal oxide includes at least one of
          bismuth, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, praseodymium, or a
          combination thereof. Preferably, in that embodiment, the metal
          oxide includes at least one of Bi(III,V) oxide, Co(II,III)
          oxide, Cu(I,III) oxide, Fe(II,III) oxide, Mn(II,III) oxide,
          Pr(III,IV) oxide, or a combination thereof. In another
          embodiment, the metal oxide can include Ag(I,III) oxide.
          Alternately, the pharmaceutical composition does not include
          tetrasilver tetroxide. In another alternate embodiment, the
          pharmaceutical composition does not include tricobalt
          tetroxide. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition
          may include at least two different electron active compounds.
          In another embodiment, the compound may be in powder or
          granular form.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] In a preferred embodiment, the first valence and the
          second valence of the at least two polyvalent cations differ
          by at least 1, preferably by 1 or 2. In another preferred
          embodiment, the first valence and the second valence of the at
          least two polyvalent cations differ by more than 2.
          Advantageously, the electron active compound has at least one
          polyvalent cation which has an EMF&lt;ox &gt;of at least about
          +0.1 Volts.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] In one embodiment, the amount of the at least one
          electron active compound is present in an amount from about1
          ppm to 500,000 ppm, based on the weight of the composition. If
          desired, the pharmaceutical composition can include a
          pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Optionally, the
          composition can also include an oxidizing agent, preferably
          present in an amount sufficient to enhance the efficacy of the
          active compound but insufficient to cause skin irritation.
          Preferably, the oxidizing agent includes a peroxy acid salt of
          a persulfate.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] In a preferred embodiment, the at least one compound
          has antimicrobial efficacy, preferably of at least about 20%.
          In another embodiment, the antimicrobial efficacy is at least
          about 50%. In yet another embodiment, the antimicrobial
          efficacy is at least about 80%. In these embodiments, about
          100 ppm of the at least one compound is placed in contact for
          about 10 minutes with microbes having a cell density of
          approximately 75,000 CFU/mL.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Also an aspect of the present invention is a
          pharmaceutical composition comprising tetracopper tetroxide
          compound. Advantageously, the tetracopper tetroxide contains
          two copper(I) ions, two copper(III) ions, and four oxygen
          atoms in a crystal lattice.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Another aspect of the present invention is a method of
          preventing, treating, or managing a condition of a patient
          which includes administering a therapeutically effective
          amount of at least one of the electron active compounds
          described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative
          thereof, to prevent, treat, or manage the condition, or a
          symptom thereof. In one embodiment, the method excludes
          tetrasilver tetroxide. In a preferred embodiment, the patient
          is a mammal, preferably, a human. Advantageously, the electron
          active compound(s) can be administered topically,
          parenterally, or transdermally, preferably in an amount from
          about 5 ppm to 500,000 ppm, based on the weight of the
          composition. In one embodiment, at least two different
          electron active compounds are administered.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] In another embodiment, the method can include
          administering one or more additional different therapeutic
          agents, present in an amount sufficient to facilitate the
          prevention, treatment, or management of the condition. In this
          embodiment, the one or ore additional therapeutic agents may
          optionally be administered concurrently with the electron
          active compound(s).<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Another aspect of the present invention relates to a
          method of facilitating the killing of a pathogen which
          includes administering a therapeutically effective amount of
          at least one electron active compound, or a pharmaceutically
          acceptable derivative thereof, that has at least two
          polyvalent cations, at least one of which having a first
          valence state and at least one of which having a second
          different valence state.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] The present invention also involves a method of
          inhibiting the growth of a pathogen which comprises
          administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least
          one electron active compound, or a pharmnaceutically
          acceptable derivative thereof, that has at least two
          polyvalent cations, at least one of which having a first
          valence state and at least one of which having a second
          different valence state.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] In one embodiment, these methods exclude the
          administration of tetrasilver tetroxide. In either of these
          methods, the pathogen can include a gram-positive bacillus or
          coccus; a gram-negative bacillus or coccus; an acid-fast
          bacterium; another type of bacterium; a fungus; a parasitic
          microbe; a virus; or a combination thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Tetracopper tetroxide, containing two copper(I) ions,
          two copper(III) ions, and four oxygen atoms, is one preferred
          electron active compound, while the administration of
          tetrasilver tetroxide for treating certain conditions is
          excluded.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] In addition, the present invention relates to a process
          for preparing tetracopper tetroxide, which includes: combining
          a copper(I)-containing compound and a caustic solution to form
          a reactant solution; and heating the reactant solution to a
          temperature and for a time sufficient to produce a detectable
          amount of the tetracopper tetroxide compound. Advantageously,
          the copper(I)-containing compound includes a non-solvated
          inorganic copper(I) oxide, such as cuprous oxide.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] The caustic solution generally contains a strong
          caustic base and a peroxy acid salt. Preferably, the strong
          caustic base includes a hydroxide salt, and the peroxy acid
          salt includes a persulfate.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
            INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0040] The tetrasilver tetroxide compounds mentioned in the
          background are one type of electron active compound having
          multivalent cations in its crystal lattice. Various additional
          electron active compounds have now also been identified, as
          well as methods for making and using the same for treating
          various pathogenic and non-pathogenic conditions or disorders.
          The electron active compounds of the present invention are
          believed to have unique crystal structures in that, in the
          case of the metal oxides, there are generally atoms of the
          same element in the crystal that have at least two different
          valences, typically at least one lower-valent metal cation and
          at least one higher-valent metal cation, for example, such as
          Co(II) and Co(III), respectively. Exemplary electron active
          metal oxide compounds according to the invention include, but
          are not limited to, Ag(I,III), Co(II,III), Pr(III,IV),
          Bi(III,V), Fe(II,III), Mn(II,III), and Cu(I,III) oxides. In
          another embodiment, Tb(III,IV) oxide, Tb4O7, or tetraterbium
          heptoxide, is one electron active metal oxide compound
          according to the invention. As discussed below, pharmaceutical
          compositions including one or more of such oxide compounds are
          useful for treating various conditions. The composition of
          such exemplary electron active metal oxides is shown in
          tabular form below:<br>

          &nbsp; # - number of particular ion type per formula unit.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] Without being bound to theory, it is believed that the
          electron active compounds operate against pathogens by
          transferring electrons between their lower-valent ions and
          their higher-valent ions in the crystal, thereby contributing
          to the death of pathogens by traversing their cell membrane
          surface. It would seem that this, in effect, "electrocutes"
          the pathogens. While these compounds have also been discovered
          to be suitable for use in the prevention, treatment, and
          management of other non-pathogenic conditions and disorders,
          such as autoimmune disorders, circulatory disorders,
          neurological disorders, and the like, the mechanism by which
          such conditions or disorders are prevented, treated, or
          managed has not yet been fully understood. In any event, the
          electrons in proximity to pathogens are believed to be
          perturbed from their balanced crystals by such labile groups
          as NH, NH2, S-S, and SH, which can be present, for example, in
          a pathogen cell membrane. It is believed, however, that normal
          cells will not be significantly affected because they do not
          proliferate rapidly enough to expose these labile bonds
          sufficiently for the bonds to be substantially affected.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] The crystals in the electron active compounds are not
          believed to be disturbed unless more stable complexes are
          formed with ligands, for example, such as those comprising a
          pathogen cell membrane surface in a dynamic state. Indeed, the
          end result of electron transfer, which is a redox reaction,
          results in the lower-valent metal ions being oxidized to one
          valence state higher and the higher-valent metal ions being
          reduced to one valence state lower. In one embodiment, the
          oxidation of the lower-valent metal ions and the reduction of
          the higher-valent metal ions both result in ions having the
          same oxidation state. Examples of such an embodiment occur
          when the valence difference between the metal ions in the
          electron active molecular crystal is 2 and such examples
          include, but are not limited to, Ag(I,III), Bi(III,V), and
          Cu(I,III) oxides. In another embodiment, the oxidation of the
          lower-valent metal ions and the reduction of the higher-valent
          metal ions result in ions having opposite oxidation states
          (e.g., ions with a +2 valence state are oxidized to +3, while
          the ions with a +3 valence state are reduced to +2). Examples
          of such an embodiment occur when the valence difference
          between the metal ions in the electron active molecular
          crystal is 1 and such examples include, but are not limited
          to, Co(II,III), Fe(II,III), Mn(II,III), and Pr(III,IV) oxides.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] The metal ion of certain electron active compounds may
          exhibit a distinct affinity for certain elements of ligands,
          for example, such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen, particularly
          when present in a pathogen's cell membrane. In many cases, the
          metal ion will not merely bind to these elements, but will
          actually form chelate complexes with their ligands. The
          classic example of this is Ag(I,III) oxide, the monovalent
          silver ion of which has an affinity for sulfur and nitrogen
          and the oxidized/reduced divalent ion of which forms chelate
          complexes with, for example, mercapto or amino groups. Thus,
          the electron active compound attraction for the cell membrane
          surfaces, for example, of pathogens, is believed to be driven
          by powerful electrostatic forces.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] Without being bound by theory, the electron exchange
          may be depicted, for example, by the following series of redox
          half reactions:<br>

          <br>
          [0045] For each redox reaction, there is believed to be an
          electromotive force, which is the voltage potential of the
          oxidizing the higher-valent ion in the metal oxide crystal.
          This is denoted herein as EMF&lt;OX&gt;. In addition to the
          electromotive force of oxidation, there is believed to be an
          associated reduction reaction involving the lower-valent ion
          in the metal oxide crystal. This reduction reaction may be
          represented simply, as tabulated above, or may represent the
          interaction with, for example, a ligand present on a pathogen
          cell membrane surface, such as one containing sulfur or
          nitrogen. Associated with the reduction reaction is another
          electromotive force, or voltage potential of the reducing the
          lower-valent ion. This is denoted herein as EMF&lt;RE&gt;.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] When the metal ions of the electron active metal oxide
          interact with, for example, a sulfur-containing ligand, the
          affinity of the metal ion for sulfur affects EMF&lt;RE&gt;.
          The stability of a particular metal sulfide is an
          approximation of the affinity of a metal ion for sulfur. The
          following approximate association constants for sulfides
          indicate the trend in relative affinity of each metal ion for
          sulfur:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ag(I)&nbsp; 49<br>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mn(II)&nbsp; 15<br>
          <br>
          [0047] In general, the more stable the compound, the more
          negative its reduction potential in the reduction reaction,
          for example, in the case of elemental silver:<br>
          <br>
          [0048] 2Ag+S&lt;-2&gt;-2e-&gt;Ag2S EMF&lt;RE&gt;=-0.66<br>
          <br>
          [0049] In the case of tetrasilver tetroxide, there is a
          reduction reaction where Ag(I) is oxidized and an oxidation
          reaction where Ag(III) is reduced, as follows:<br>
          <br>
          EMI1.1<br>
          <br>
          [0050] The voltage that is discharged from a redox reaction of
          the electron active metal oxides of the present invention,
          which voltage is denoted herein as the "electrocution
          voltage," is the combination of the oxidizing cation's
          reduction potentials and the reducing cation's reduction
          potential (i.e., EMF&lt;OX&gt;-EMF&lt;RE&gt;) In the case of
          tetrasilver tetroxide, the "electrocution voltage" is 2.92
          volts. The oxidizing cation's reduction potentials,
          EMF&lt;OX&gt;, of exemplary metal oxides according to the
          present invention are tabulated below:<br>

          <br>
          [0051] As noted from the above table, praseodymium-, cobalt-,
          and copper-based oxides are believed to be stronger
          antipathogenic agents or to form better pharmaceutical
          compositions than manganese-, bismuth-, and iron-based oxides,
          and in one embodiment they are preferred for this reason.
          Nevertheless, in certain cases, iron exhibits stronger
          antipathogenic characteristics, particularly antimicrobial
          characteristics, compared to manganese.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] Another factor, however, particularly in antipathogenic
          or antimicrobial efficacy, can be the sulfur/nitrogen
          composition, for example, of cell membranes. For example,
          Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, in a culture having a cell
          density of 30,000 CFU/mL, exhibit significant mortality from
          exposure to 100 ppm of Bi(III,V) oxide for about 10 minutes,
          but no significant mortality from exposure to the same
          concentrations of Fe(II,III) and Mn(II,III) oxides for the
          same contact time. This result might be explained by the far
          greater stability of bismuth(III) sulfide, and thus the far
          greater affinity of bismuth(III) for sulfur, than either of
          the iron(II) or manganese(II) analogs.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] The electron active metal oxide compounds and
          compositions of the present invention may be used in any form
          which sufficiently retains their antipathogenic character, or
          other non-pathogenic ability, to prevent, treat, or manage one
          or more of the conditions noted herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0054] These compounds or compositions may be used as
          antipathogenic agents, such as antimicrobial, antibacterial,
          antiviral, or anti-algal agents, or a combination thereof. In
          another embodiment, the compounds or compositions may be used
          for preventing, treating, and/or managing various conditions
          that are non-pathogenic. For example, non-pathogenic
          conditions are believed to include certain autoimmune
          disorders, neurological disorders, and circulatory disorders.
          While the exact mechanism of the activity of such compounds or
          compositions is not described herein, nonetheless, suitable
          prevention, treatment, and/or management of such
          non-pathogenic conditions may be obtained by administering the
          compounds or compositions of the invention as described herein
          and as will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in
          the art.<br>

          <br>
          [0064] The antipathogenic or non-pathogenic compositions of
          the present invention may optionally further include the use
          of one or more additional therapeutic agents known to treat a
          condition, or a symptom thereof. Examples of such additional
          therapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, chelating
          agents, vitamins, minerals, silica hydride microclusters,
          analgesics, Sambucol(TM), aspirin, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] The electron active metal oxide compounds of the
          present invention may also be used for water treatment, for
          example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,149 and
          5,336,416. Optionally but preferably, the electron active
          metal oxides used for treating a body of water are any listed
          above, more preferably provided that the metal oxide does not
          include tetrasilver tetroxide. It is also more preferable, in
          the previous embodiment, that the metal oxide does not include
          tetracopper tetroxide.<br>
          <br>
          [0066] The administration of one or more active ingredients
          and/or optional therapeutic agent(s), in accordance with the
          methods of the invention may occur together, concurrently but
          separately, sequentially, or a combination thereof. The
          optional additional therapeutic agent is generally a compound
          other than an electron active metal oxide compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0067] The antipathogenic or antimicrobial performance of
          certain metal oxides may be improved or enhanced by the
          presence of an oxidizing agent. This is particularly the case
          when the metal oxide compounds or compositions are present in
          low amounts, i.e., typically less than 45 ppm, and more
          commonly when present in an amount less than about 40 ppm,
          based on the weight of the composition. In such situations, an
          oxidizing agent may be included in certain compositions of the
          invention in small amounts when the compositions are
          administered by certain routes. In such an embodiment, the
          oxidizing agent includes a peroxy acid salt, preferably a
          Group I salt of a persulfate, more preferably potassium
          persulfate. In another embodiment, the oxidizing agent
          includes the same peroxy acid salt which was present as a
          starting material in the reaction to form the particular
          electron active metal oxide. The oxidizing agent may
          advantageously be present in the composition in amounts from
          about 1 ppm to 500 ppm, based on the weight of the
          composition. In alternate embodiments, there may be from about
          5 ppm to 200 ppm or from about 10 ppm to 100 ppm of oxidizing
          agent, based on the weight of the composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] It is believed that the additional presence of certain
          types or amounts of oxidizing agent(s) may tend to irritate
          the skin, particularly when the compound or composition
          including metal oxide(s) is present in large amounts, such as
          greater than 50 ppm, based on the weight of the composition.
          In one embodiment, as more compound or composition is
          administered, a correspondingly smaller amount of undesirable
          oxidizing agent is required. Thus, in some embodiments, it has
          been found that the additional oxidizing agent is unnecessary
          and in fact undesirable for the purpose of treating certain
          conditions described herein, since the additional oxide may
          have or contribute to an undesirable side effect, for example,
          such as skin irritation when applied topically. For those
          embodiments, the compositions minimize the amount of
          additional oxidizing agent, such as persulfate, or are
          substantially or completely free of added persulfates or other
          oxidizing agents.<br>
          <br>
          [0069] Certain of the electron active metal oxides may be
          black in color, such that care must be taken when formulating
          suitable topical pharmaceutical compositions according to the
          invention to inhibit blackening or superficial discoloration
          of the skin. Without being bound by theory, it is believed
          that larger amounts of such compositions promote increased
          superficial discoloration. Thus, in one embodiment, the
          pharmaceutical compositions preferably have an insufficient
          amount of metal oxide composition to cause visible skin
          discoloration.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] Additionally, it was found by rigorous testing that
          certain silver tetroxide-containing compositions were
          comparatively non-toxic compared to silver salts, such as
          conventional formulations of silver nitrate, silver
          sulfadiazine, and benzoyl peroxide. Since these silver
          tetroxide compositions were effective at certain ppm
          concentrations in killing pathogens in nutrient broth and for
          water treatment, commercial concentrates were formulated with
          2% of the tetrasilver tetroxide. For acceptance of the oxide
          in commerce, for which EPA registration No. 3432-64 was
          obtained, it was necessary for the Ag4O4 to undergo a series
          of toxicity tests. A 3% concentrate was used and evaluated by
          a certified laboratory employing good laboratory practice
          (GLP) according to the Code of Federal Regulations for this
          purpose. The results were as follows:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute Oral Toxicity&nbsp; LD50 Greater than
          5,000 mg/Kg<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute Dermal Toxicity&nbsp; LD50 Greater
          than 2,000 mg/Kg<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Eye Irritation&nbsp; Mildly
          irritating<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Skin Irritation&nbsp; No irritation<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skin Sensitization&nbsp; Non-Sensitizing<br>
          <br>
          [0071] Subsequent evaluations conducted according to the
          invention showed that unless persons were prone to silver
          allergies, the pure tetrasilver tetroxide compositions
          according to the invention could be applied to the skin
          without any ill effects or evidence of irritation, despite the
          fact that the compositions of the invention can be a powerful
          oxidizing agent. This can perhaps be explained by the
          stability manifested by the KA of the tetrasilver tetroxide
          compositions, which is approximately 7.9*10&lt;-13&gt;.<br>
          <br>
          [0072] Where the electron active compositions according to the
          invention are applied to the skin, they may be combined with a
          carrier in an amount from about 5 ppm to 500,000 ppm, more
          preferably from about 50 ppm to 250,000 ppm of the electron
          active metal oxide composition, based on the weight of the
          composition. In various embodiments, the compositions are
          provided in amounts from about 400 ppm to 100,000 ppm, from
          about 1,000 ppm to 70,000 ppm, from about 10,000 ppm to 50,000
          ppm, or from about 20,000 ppm to 40,000 ppm, based on the
          weight of the composition. In one preferred embodiment, the
          compositions are formulated with about 25,000 ppm to 35,000
          ppm of metal oxide, based on the weight of the composition. It
          will be readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the
          art that the ppm concentration of electron active compound(s),
          such as metal oxide, in the composition is based on the total
          weight of the composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0073] When prevent, treating, or managing conditions, a
          preferred embodiment employs amounts of about 0.1 to 10
          percent by weight, about 0.25 to 5 percent by weight, or about
          2 to 4 percent by weight of the compounds or compositions of
          the invention. The compositions, when applied topically, can
          be applied to the skin about1 to 3 times per day until the
          condition is suitably cured or satisfactorily controlled. In
          one embodiment, the composition may generally be topically
          applied at a dosage level of from about 1 mg to 1000 mg per
          cm&lt;2 &gt;of skin surface, preferably about 10 mg to 500 mg
          per cm&lt;2 &gt;of skin surface. When applied topically, a
          preferred carrier includes petroleum jelly, such as white
          petroleum jelly. For example, a suitable white petroleum jelly
          is available from Penreco of Houston, Tex.<br>
          <br>
          [0074] Most of the metal oxide compounds for use according to
          the invention are commercially available from various sources.
          Tetrasilver tetroxide compositions for use according to the
          invention have been commercially sold under the poorly named
          "Ag(II) OXIDE" tradename. They may be obtained from Aldrich
          Chemical Co., Inc., having a place of business in Milwaukee,
          Wis. The chemical synthesis of tetrasilver tetroxide compounds
          can be performed according to the method described on page 148
          in M. Antelman, "Anti-Pathogenic Multivalent Silver Molecular
          Semiconductors," Precious Metals, vol. 16:141-149 (1992) by
          reacting silver nitrate with potassium peroxydisulfate
          according to the following equation in alkali solutions:<br>
          <br>
          [0075]
          4AgNO3+2K2S2O8+8NaOH-&gt;Ag4O4+3Na2SO4K2SO4+2NaNO3+2KNO3+4H2O<br>
          <br>
          [0076] To the extent necessary to understand the present
          invention, the disclosure of Antelman is hereby incorporated
          herein by express reference thereto.<br>
          <br>
          [0077] Tetracopper tetroxide, also referred to herein as
          Cu(I,III) oxide or Cu4O4, is a preferred electron active
          compound in accordance with the invention. This compound may
          be prepared as follows.<br>
          <br>
          [0078] Suitable copper-based starting materials for this
          reaction include at least one copper(I)-containing material.
          In one embodiment, a water soluble copper(I) salt can be used.
          Typically, a water soluble copper(I) salt can be prepared by
          dissolving an inorganic copper(I) compound, for example, such
          as cuprous oxide, in an appropriate acid, for example, an
          organic acid, such as acetic acid. Since soluble copper(I)
          salts are not readily commercially available at the present
          time, however, a non-solvated inorganic copper(I) compound,
          such as cuprous oxide itself, can be used as the
          copper(I)-containing starting material. In addition, other
          copper(I)-containing materials, either inorganic, such as a
          copper(I) oxide, or organic, such as an organometallic
          copper(I) compound, or both, may be used, where the
          copper(I)-containing material(s) are sufficiently soluble in
          an aqueous or organic solution to allow reaction with other
          materials to form an electron active copper oxide compound.<br>
          <br>
          [0079] The copper(I)-containing starting material is combined
          with an aqueous caustic solution. This caustic solution
          preferably contains two components: a strong caustic base and
          a peroxy acid salt. Examples of suitable strong caustic bases
          include Group I and Group II hydroxides, preferably sodium
          hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Examples of suitable peroxy
          acid salts include Group I salts of persulfates, preferably
          potassium persulfate.<br>
          <br>
          [0080] The copper-based starting material is typically the
          limiting reagent in such a preparation. The ratio of each of
          the components in the caustic solution to that of the
          copper-based starting material is theoretically set by the
          stoichiometry of the particular reaction. In one preferred
          embodiment, there is a relative molar excess, i.e., an amount
          more than stoichiometrically necessary, of each of the
          components in the caustic solution with respect to the
          copper-based starting material. When a strong caustic base and
          a peroxy acid salt are present in the caustic solution, the
          relative molar excesses of the components may be at least
          about 50% and at least about 10%, respectively, preferably at
          least about 100% and at least about 20%, respectively, more
          preferably, at least about 250% and at least about 40%,
          respectively, most preferably at least about 500% and at least
          about 75%, respectively.<br>
          <br>
          [0081] Generally, the reactants may be added together in any
          manner that comports with typical laboratory procedure. In one
          embodiment, the copper(I)-containing starting material is
          placed in a reactor, to which the strong caustic base and the
          peroxy acid salt are added, each typically in their own
          solutions. The solution containing the reactants is then
          typically heated to a temperature sufficient to activate a
          reaction, preferably sufficient to activate a reaction with no
          major undesirable side reactions or other undesirable effects,
          more preferably above about 80[deg.] C., most preferably about
          90[deg.] C. to 95[deg.] C. The solution is heated for a time
          sufficient to facilitate the reaction, preferably to provide
          substantial completion of the reaction, preferably for at
          least about 5 minutes, more preferably for at least about 15
          minutes, after which time the solution is allowed to cool or
          is cooled, preferably to below about 45[deg.] C., more
          preferably to about room temperature.<br>
          <br>
          [0082] The color change of the solution, from its original
          color, red, to a color indicating a reaction has occurred, in
          this case black, may occur at the heated temperature or during
          or after cooling.<br>
          <br>
          [0083] The purification and isolation of the desired product
          can be accomplished by any suitable method available to those
          of ordinary skill in the art. In the majority of situations,
          the desired reaction product is primarily a solid, but may be
          dissolved or dispersed in at least part of the solution. In
          one preferred embodiment, the solution is carefully decanted
          off, and then the remaining product is washed multiple times
          with distilled water, before being sufficiently dried. In
          another preferred embodiment, the solution is vacuum filtered
          to remove the filtrate, and the remaining product is
          sufficiently dried.<br>
          <br>
          [0084] The yield of solid tetracopper tetroxide material,
          based on the reactants, is typically at least about 10%,
          preferably at least about 45%, more preferably at least about
          75%, most preferably at least about 80%.<br>
          <br>
          [0085] In addition, Fe(II,III) oxide and Mn(II,III) oxide are
          commercially available from Aldrich Company of Milwaukee,
          Wis., and Co(II,III) oxide and Pr(III,IV) oxide are
          commercially available from Noah Technologies of San Antonio,
          Tex. Also, Bi(III,V) oxide synthetic routes are detailed and
          reviewed in Gmelins Handbuch Der Anorganischen Chemie, vol.
          16:642 (1964), and the oxide is available commercially from
          City Chemicals of New York, N.Y.<br>
          <br>
          [0086] The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of
          electron active composition(s), or a derivative thereof, in
          the acute or chronic management of diseases and disorders
          described herein will vary with the severity of the condition
          to be prevented, treated, or managed and the route of
          administration. For example, oral, mucosal (including rectal
          and vaginal), parenteral (including subcutaneous,
          intramuscular, bolus injection, and intravenous, such as by
          infusion), sublingual, transdermal, nasal, buccal, and like
          may be employed. In one embodiment, a patient may gargle using
          the composition of the present invention. Dosage forms include
          tablets, troches, lozenges, dispersions, suspensions,
          suppositories, solutions, capsules, soft elastic gelatin
          capsules, patches, and the like. The dose, and perhaps the
          dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body
          weight, and response of the individual patient. Suitable
          dosing regimens can be readily selected by those of ordinary
          skill in the art with due consideration of such factors. In
          general, the total daily dosage for the conditions described
          herein, is from about 0.1 mg to 1,000 mg of the active
          ingredient, i.e., one of the metal oxides described herein, or
          a derivative thereof. In another embodiment, the daily dosage
          can be from about 1 mg to 500 mg, while in another embodiment,
          the daily dosage can be from about 2 mg to 200 mg of the metal
          oxide composition. A unit dosage can include, for example, 30
          mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, or 300 mg of metal oxide
          composition. Preferably, the active ingredient is administered
          in single or divided doses from one to four times a day, such
          as by topical administration. In another embodiment, the
          compositions are administered by an oral route of
          administration. The oral dosage forms may be conveniently
          presented in unit dosage forms and prepared by any methods
          available to those of ordinary skill in the art of pharmacy.<br>
          <br>
          [0087] In managing the patient, the therapy may be initiated
          at a lower dose, e.g., from about 1 mg, and increased up to
          the recommended daily dose or higher depending on the
          patient's global response. It is further recommended that
          children, patients over 65 years, and those with impaired
          renal or hepatic function, initially receive low doses when
          administered systemically, and that they be titrated based on
          individual response(s) and blood level(s). It may be necessary
          to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases, as will be
          apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore,
          it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know
          how and when to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in
          conjunction with individual patient response.<br>
          <br>
          [0088] Any suitable route of administration may be employed
          for providing the patient with an effective dosage of electron
          active metal oxide, or a derivative thereof. The most suitable
          route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity
          of the condition being prevented, treated, or managed.<br>
          <br>
          [0089] In practical use, the metal oxide, or a derivative
          thereof, can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate
          admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to
          conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The
          carrier may take a wide variety of forms and may include a
          number of components depending on the form of preparation
          desired for administration. The compositions of the present
          invention may include, but are not limited to, suspensions,
          solutions and elixirs; aerosols; or carriers, including, but
          not limited to, starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose,
          diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders,
          disintegrating agents, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          [0090] Suitable forms in which the electron active compounds
          or compositions of the present invention may be used include,
          but are not limited to, powder, granule, flake, solution,
          suspension, emulsion, slurry, aerosol spray, gel, paste, and
          combinations thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the form is
          a powder or solution. When the electron active compounds are
          in the form of a solution, the solution may be aqueous,
          non-aqueous, or a combination thereof, preferably at least
          partially aqueous, more preferably substantially aqueous. In a
          preferred embodiment, the metal oxides are in an aqueous
          solution.<br>
          <br>
          [0091] The compositions of the invention may be applied
          topically, e.g., either directly as a powder or in
          non-sprayable or sprayable form. Non-sprayable forms can be
          semi-solid or solid forms including a carrier indigenous to
          topical application and preferably having a dynamic viscosity
          greater than that of water. Suitable formulations include, but
          are not limited to, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments,
          powders, liniments, salves and the like. If desired, these may
          be sterilized or mixed with any available auxiliary agents,
          carriers, or excipients, e.g., thixotropes, stabilizers,
          wetting agents, and the like. One or more thixotropic agents
          can be included in types and amounts sufficient to increase
          adhesion of topically applied compositions of the invention to
          the skin, so as to inhibit or prevent runoff or other loss of
          the composition from the treatment zone on the skin. Preferred
          vehicles for non-sprayable topical preparations include
          ointment bases, e.g., polyethylene glycol-1000 (PEG-1000);
          conventional ophthalmic vehicles; creams; and gels, as well as
          petroleum jelly and the like. In one more preferred
          embodiment, the carrier includes a petroleum jelly. In another
          preferred embodiment, the carrier is formulated as a cream,
          gel, or lotion. In another preferred embodiment, the carrier
          is 3 weight percent active ingredient, 36 weight percent heavy
          mineral oil, 47 weight percent petroleum jelly, and 14 weight
          percent Tivawax P, which is available from Tivian
          Laboratories, Inc., of Providence, R.I. In yet another
          preferred embodiment, the composition may be a dry powder,
          such as with 5 weight percent active ingredient and 95 weight
          percent bismuth subgallate. These topical preparations may
          also contain emollients, perfumes, and/or pigments to enhance
          their acceptability for various usages.<br>
          <br>
          [0092] The compositions may also be formulated for parenteral
          administration by injection (subcutaneous, bolus injection,
          intramuscular, or intravenous, such as by infusion), and may
          be dispensed in a unit dosage form, such as a multidose
          container or an ampule. Compositions of the electron active
          metal oxide, or a derivative thereof, for parenteral
          administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions,
          emulsions, or the like, in aqueous or oily vehicles, and in
          addition to the active ingredient may contain one or more
          formulary agents, such as dispersing agents, suspending
          agents, stabilizing agents, preservatives, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          [0093] In the case where an intravenous injection or infusion
          composition is employed, a suitable dosage range can be, e.g.,
          from about 0.5 mg (0.1 ppm) to about 1,000 mg (200 ppm) total
          dose, preferably from about 5 mg (1 ppm) to 400 mg (80 ppm).
          In one preferred embodiment, the total dose can be from about
          50 mg (10 ppm) to 200 mg (40 ppm). It should be understood
          that any suitable amount of the composition according to the
          invention may be administered if effective to prevent, treat,
          or manage one or more conditions described herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0094] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention
          may be orally administered in discrete pharmaceutical unit
          dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, soft elastic gelatin
          capsules, tablets, or aerosols sprays, each containing a
          predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or
          granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous
          liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a
          water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be
          prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods
          include the step of bringing into association the active
          ingredient with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which
          constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the
          compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing
          the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided
          solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the
          product into the desired presentation. Suitable types of oral
          administration include oral solid preparations, such as
          capsules or tablets, or oral liquid preparations. If desired,
          tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous
          techniques.<br>
          <br>
          [0095] For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or
          molding, optionally, with one or more accessory ingredients.
          Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a
          suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form
          such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder,
          lubricant, inert diluent, granulating agent, surface active
          agent, dispersing agent, or the like. Molded tablets may be
          made by molding, in a suitable machine, a mixture of the
          powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. In
          one embodiment, each tablet, capsule, cachet, or gel cap
          contains from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg of the active
          ingredient, while in another embodiment, each tablet contains
          from about1 mg to about 250 mg of the active ingredient. The
          amount of active ingredient found in the composition, however,
          may vary depending on the amount of active ingredient to be
          administered to the patient.<br>
          <br>
          [0096] Another suitable route of administration is transdermal
          delivery, for example, via an abdominal skin patch.<br>
          <br>
          [0097] The metal oxide(s), or a derivative thereof, may be
          formulated as a pharmaceutical composition in a soft elastic
          gelatin capsule unit dosage form by using conventional methods
          well known in the art, such as in Ebert, Pharm. Tech,
          1(5):44-50 (1977). Soft elastic gelatin capsules have a soft,
          globular gelatin shell somewhat thicker than that of hard
          gelatin capsules, wherein a gelatin is plasticized by the
          addition of plasticizing agent, e.g., glycerin, sorbitol, or a
          similar polyol. The hardness of the capsule shell may be
          changed by varying the type of gelatin used and the amounts of
          plasticizer and water. The soft gelatin shells may contain an
          additional preservative, such as methyl- and propylparabens
          and sorbic acid, to prevent the growth of fungi, although this
          is not necessary since the compounds and compositions of the
          invention provide anti-fungal efficacy. Thus, in one
          embodiment, the invention includes a compositions formulated
          as a gelatin shell with an electron active metal oxide
          compound of the present invention, completely free of added
          preservatives. The active ingredient may be dissolved or
          suspended in a liquid vehicle or carrier, such as vegetable or
          mineral oils, glycols such as polyethylene glycol and
          propylene glycol, triglycerides, surfactants such as
          polysorbates, or a combination thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0098] In addition to the common dosage forms set out above,
          the compounds of the present invention may also be
          administered by controlled release means, delivery devices, or
          both, as are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art,
          such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770;
          3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533;
          5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476;
          5,354,556; and 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are hereby
          incorporated herein by express reference thereto. These
          pharmaceutical compositions can be used to provide slow or
          controlled-release of the active ingredient therein using, for
          example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to
          provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices,
          gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer
          coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or the
          like, or a combination thereof. Suitable controlled-release
          formulations available to those of ordinary skill in the art,
          including those described herein, may be readily selected for
          use with the tetrasilver tetroxide compositions of the
          invention. Thus, single unit dosage forms suitable for topical
          or oral administration, such as gels, lotions, cremes,
          tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, and the like, that are
          adapted for controlled-release are encompassed by the present
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0099] All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a
          common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by
          their non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an
          optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical
          treatment is characterized by a minimum of the active
          ingredient being employed to cure or control the condition in
          a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release
          formulations may include: 1) extended activity of the active
          ingredient; 2) reduced dosage frequency; and 3) increased
          patient compliance.<br>
          <br>
          [0100] Most controlled-release formulations are designed to
          initially release an amount of active ingredient that promptly
          produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradual and
          continual release of other amounts of active ingredient to
          maintain this level of therapeutic effect over an extended
          period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of
          active ingredient in the body, the active ingredient should be
          released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the
          amount of active ingredient being metabolized and excreted
          from the body.<br>
          <br>
          [0101] The controlled-release of the active ingredient may be
          stimulated by various inducers, for example pH, temperature,
          enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or
          compounds. The term "controlled-release component" in the
          context of the present invention is defined herein as a
          compound or compounds, including polymers, polymer matrices,
          gels, permeable membranes, liposomes, microspheres, or the
          like, or a combination thereof, that facilitates the
          controlled-release of the active ingredient (e.g., tetrasilver
          tetroxide) in the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0102] The pharmaceutical compositions for use in the present
          invention include electron active metal oxides, or a
          derivative thereof, as the active ingredient, and may also
          contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and optionally,
          other therapeutic ingredients. Suitable derivatives include
          any available "pharmaceutically acceptable salts," which refer
          to a salt prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic
          acids including inorganic acids, organic acids, solvates,
          hydrates, or clathrates thereof. Examples of such inorganic
          acids are nitric, sulfuric, lactic, glycolic, salicylic, and
          phosphoric. Appropriate organic acids may be selected, for
          example, from aliphatic, aromatic, carboxylic and sulfonic
          classes of organic acids, examples of which are formic,
          acetic, propionic, succinic, camphorsulfonic, citric, fumaric,
          gluconic, isethionic, lactic, malic, mucic, tartaric,
          para-toluenesulfonic, glycolic, glucuronic, maleic, furoic,
          glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, salicylic, phenylacetic,
          mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic,
          pantothenic, benzenesulfonic (besylate), stearic, sulfanilic,
          alginic, galacturonic, and the like. Particularly preferred
          acids are lactic, glycolic, and salicylic acids. The
          pharmaceutically acceptable salts preferably do not include
          halide-containing salts when tetrasilver tetroxide is present,
          as these salts are believed to facilitate breakdown of the
          oxide lattice present in the silver oxide compositions of the
          invention.<br>

          [0104] A culture of Salmonella of cell density 500,000 CFU/mL
          was contacted for 10 minutes with approximately 4 ppm
          hexapraseodymium undecoxide (Pr6O11), which is believed to
          contain two distinct oxidation states of praseodymium, Pr(III)
          and Pr(IV), in its crystal lattice, at a pH of about 9,
          followed with a culture adjusted to a pH of about 10. The
          percentages of bacterial colonies killed by this treatment
          were 96.4% and 93.8%, respectively. The experiment was
          repeated with the same cell density of Salmonella using about
          5 ppm of tricobalt tetroxide (Co3O4), which is believed to
          contain two distinct oxidation states of cobalt, Co(II) and
          Co(III), in its crystal lattice, at a pH of about 10. The

          [0117] Based on all of the test data described above, the
          healing mechanism associated with the use of the metal oxides
          of the invention to treat and manage at least some skin
          diseases, without being bound by theory, appears to involve
          mechanisms other than merely inhibiting or killing pathogens
          and curing infections that tend to aggravate disease and
          retard the natural healing process. The data indicate that
          healing is brought about even in cases where no abnormal
          bacteria counts or infection is evident. This suggests that
          the electron active compound(s) may also act against
          auto-antibodies that trigger autoimmune reactions associated
          with diseased tissue, as well as against other non-pathogenic
          conditions or diseases, such as circulatory or neurological

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0004] Tetrasilver tetroxide has been demonstrated to possess
          unique properties arising from electrostatic concepts of metal
          cation interaction. Such silver molecules have also been
          disclosed for various uses, as they are reported to be
          non-toxic to animals and humans. M. Antelman, "Anti-Pathogenic
          Multivalent Silver Molecular Semiconductors," Precious Metals,
          vol. 16:141-149 (1992); M. Antelman, "Multivalent Silver
          Bactericides," Precious Metals, vol. 16:151-163 (1992). For
          example, tetrasilver tetroxide activated with an oxidizing
          agent is disclosed for use in bactericidal, fungicidal, and
          algicidal use, such as in municipal and industrial water
          treatment applications and for the treatment of AIDS.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] A variety of sources also report the use of certain
          divalent silver compounds for water treatment, as well as the
          use of such compounds, typically in combination with certain
          oxidizing agents, metals, or other compounds, as
          disinfectants, bactericides, algicides, and fungicides. One
          source also reports a single in vitro study of the use of such
          compounds for the treatment of AIDS. These sources include M.
          Antelman, "Silver (II, III) Disinfectants,"
          Soap/Cosmetics/Chemical Specialties, pp. 52-59 (Mar., 1994),
          and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,017,295; 5,073,382; 5,078,902; 5,089,275;
          5,098,582; 5,211,855; 5,223,149; 5,336,416; and 5,772,896.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] U.S. Patent No. 5,336,499 discloses tetrasilver
          tetroxide and persulfate compositions having certain in vitro
          anti-pathogenic properties, i.e., bactericidal, fungicidal,
          viricidal, and algicidal, in certain concentrations as low as
          0.3 ppm, particularly in nutrient broth cultures. The
          persulfate is disclosed as being an oxidizing agent that
          activates the tetroxide crystals. Also disclosed are an in
          vitro study regarding the inhibition of yeast growth in
          nutrient broth and the formulation of a gynecological cream
          and douche based on these results, and a report of an in vitro
          AIDS test with the compositions indicating total suppression
          of the virus at 18 ppm.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,520 discloses the use of molecular
          crystals of tetrasilver tetroxide, particularly with oxidizing
          agents to enhance the efficiency of such devices, for killing
          pathogenic microorganisms, such as staph infections. Amounts
          of 10 ppm sodium persulfate as an oxidizing agent were used
          with certain amounts of silver tetroxide in the reported in
          vitro testing. One human study involved in vivo curing of a
          gynecological yeast infection with 10 ppm of the silver
          tetroxide and 40 ppm sodium persulfate. Other in vivo topical
          studies report in conclusory fashion the cure of a single case
          of athlete's foot with a solution of 100 ppm of the
          composition and the cure of a single case of toenail fungus
          with a 25% suspension of the composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] U.S. Pat. No. 5,676,977 discloses intraveneously
          injected tetrasilver tetroxide crystals used for destroying
          the AIDS virus, AIDS synergistic pathogens, and immunity
          suppressing moieties (ISM) in humans. The crystals were
          formulated for a single injection at about 40 ppm of human
          blood. This reference also discloses the compositions cause
          hepatomegaly, also known as enlarged liver, albeit with no
          reported loss of liver function.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The aforementioned references report detailed
          descriptions of the mechanism via which the multivalent silver
          molecular crystal devices were believed to operate. A
          discussion of such results and concepts was presented at a
          Seminar entitled "Incurable Diseases Update" (Weizmann
          Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, Feb. 11, 1998). The
          title of this presentation was "Beyond Antibiotics, Non Toxic
          Disinfectants and Tetrasil(TM) (a composition including
          tetrasilver tetroxide)." In this paper, it was reported that
          the effects of the electron transfer involved with respect to
          the tetroxide, rendered it a more powerful germicide than
          other silver entities. Other patents cover multivalent silver
          antimicrobial compositions, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,017,295 for
          Ag(II) and U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,149 for Ag (III). These are
          stronger antimicrobial agents than Ag (I) compounds, but they
          pale by comparison to tetrasilver tetroxide. Likewise,
          colloidal silver that derives its germicidal properties from
          trace silver (I) ions it generates in various environments is
          also less effective. Accordingly, the oligodynamic properties
          of these entities may be summarized as follows, which is
          referred to as the Horsfal series:<br>
          <br>
          [0010] Ag4O4&gt;Ag(III)&gt;Ag(II)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Ag(I)<br>
          <br>
          [0011] Another property of the tetrasilver tetroxide is that
          it does not stain organic matter such as skin in like manner

          <br>
          [0012] Further, synthetic routes for making Bi(III,V) oxide
          are detailed and reviewed in Gmelins Handbuch DerAnorganischen
          Chemie, vol. 16:642 (1964). Also, Co(II,III) oxide, Fe(II,III)
          oxide, Mn(II,III) oxide, and Pr(III,IV) oxide can all be found
          in nature. These five multivalent metal oxides are also all
          available commercially.<br>

          [0013] In view of the beneficial properties of tetrasilver
          tetroxide, it could be desirable to find other medicinal uses
          for this compound, as well as to discover other electron
          active metal oxides that provide similar properties.<br>

          ppm to 500,000 ppm, based on the weight of the composition. If
          desired, the pharmaceutical composition can include a
          pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Optionally, the
          composition can also include an oxidizing agent, preferably

          a persulfate.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] In a preferred embodiment, the at least one compound
          has antimicrobial efficacy, preferably of at least about 20%.
          In another embodiment, the antimicrobial efficacy is at least
          about 50%. In yet another embodiment, the antimicrobial

          about 10 minutes with microbes having a cell density of
          approximately 75,000 CFU/mL.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Also an aspect of the present invention is a
          pharmaceutical composition comprising tetracopper tetroxide
          compound. Advantageously, the tetracopper tetroxide contains
          two copper(I) ions, two copper(III) ions, and four oxygen
          atoms in a crystal lattice.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Another aspect of the present invention is a method of
          preventing, treating, or managing a condition of a patient
          which includes administering a therapeutically effective
          amount of at least one of the electron active compounds
          described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative
          thereof, to prevent, treat, or manage the condition, or a
          symptom thereof. In one embodiment, the method excludes
          tetrasilver tetroxide. In a preferred embodiment, the patient
          is a mammal, preferably, a human. Advantageously, the electron
          active compound(s) can be administered topically,
          parenterally, or transdermally, preferably in an amount from
          about 5 ppm to 500,000 ppm, based on the weight of the
          composition. In one embodiment, at least two different
          electron active compounds are administered.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] In another embodiment, the method can include
          administering one or more additional different therapeutic
          agents, present in an amount sufficient to facilitate the
          prevention, treatment, or management of the condition. In this
          embodiment, the one or ore additional therapeutic agents may
          optionally be administered concurrently with the electron
          active compound(s).<br>
          <br>
          [0021] Another aspect of the present invention relates to a
          method of facilitating the killing of a pathogen which

          inhibiting the growth of a pathogen which comprises
          administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least
          one electron active compound, or a pharmnaceutically
          acceptable derivative thereof, that has at least two
          polyvalent cations, at least one of which having a first
          valence state and at least one of which having a second
          different valence state.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] In one embodiment, these methods exclude the
          administration of tetrasilver tetroxide. In either of these
          methods, the pathogen can include a gram-positive bacillus or
          coccus; a gram-negative bacillus or coccus; an acid-fast
          bacterium; another type of bacterium; a fungus; a parasitic
          microbe; a virus; or a combination thereof.<br>

            containing two copper(I) ions, two copper(III) ions, and
            four oxygen atoms, is one preferred electron active
            compound, while the administration of tetrasilver tetroxide
            for treating certain conditions is excluded.</span><br

            copper(I)-containing compound and a caustic solution to form
            a reactant solution; and heating the reactant solution to a
            temperature and for a time sufficient to produce a
            detectable amount of the tetracopper tetroxide compound.
            Advantageously, the copper(I)-containing compound includes a
            non-solvated inorganic copper(I) oxide, such as cuprous
            oxide.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0026] The caustic solution
            generally contains a strong caustic base and a peroxy acid
            salt. Preferably, the strong caustic base includes a
            hydroxide salt, and the peroxy acid salt includes a

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
            INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0040] The tetrasilver tetroxide compounds mentioned in the
          background are one type of electron active compound having
          multivalent cations in its crystal lattice. Various additional
          electron active compounds have now also been identified, as
          well as methods for making and using the same for treating
          various pathogenic and non-pathogenic conditions or disorders.
          The electron active compounds of the present invention are
          believed to have unique crystal structures in that, in the
          case of the metal oxides, there are generally atoms of the
          same element in the crystal that have at least two different
          valences, typically at least one lower-valent metal cation and
          at least one higher-valent metal cation, for example, such as
          Co(II) and Co(III), respectively. Exemplary electron active
          metal oxide compounds according to the invention include, but
          are not limited to, Ag(I,III), Co(II,III), Pr(III,IV),
          Bi(III,V), Fe(II,III), Mn(II,III), and Cu(I,III) oxides. In
          another embodiment, Tb(III,IV) oxide, Tb4O7, or tetraterbium
          heptoxide, is one electron active metal oxide compound
          according to the invention. As discussed below, pharmaceutical
          compositions including one or more of such oxide compounds are
          useful for treating various conditions. The composition of
          such exemplary electron active metal oxides is shown in
          tabular form below:<br>

          <br>
          [0041] Without being bound to theory, it is believed that the
          electron active compounds operate against pathogens by
          transferring electrons between their lower-valent ions and
          their higher-valent ions in the crystal, thereby contributing
          to the death of pathogens by traversing their cell membrane
          surface. It would seem that this, in effect, "electrocutes"
          the pathogens. While these compounds have also been discovered
          to be suitable for use in the prevention, treatment, and
          management of other non-pathogenic conditions and disorders,
          such as autoimmune disorders, circulatory disorders,
          neurological disorders, and the like, the mechanism by which
          such conditions or disorders are prevented, treated, or
          managed has not yet been fully understood. In any event, the
          electrons in proximity to pathogens are believed to be
          perturbed from their balanced crystals by such labile groups
          as NH, NH2, S-S, and SH, which can be present, for example, in
          a pathogen cell membrane. It is believed, however, that normal
          cells will not be significantly affected because they do not
          proliferate rapidly enough to expose these labile bonds
          sufficiently for the bonds to be substantially affected.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] The crystals in the electron active compounds are not
          believed to be disturbed unless more stable complexes are
          formed with ligands, for example, such as those comprising a
          pathogen cell membrane surface in a dynamic state. Indeed, the
          end result of electron transfer, which is a redox reaction,
          results in the lower-valent metal ions being oxidized to one
          valence state higher and the higher-valent metal ions being
          reduced to one valence state lower. In one embodiment, the
          oxidation of the lower-valent metal ions and the reduction of
          the higher-valent metal ions both result in ions having the
          same oxidation state. Examples of such an embodiment occur
          when the valence difference between the metal ions in the
          electron active molecular crystal is 2 and such examples
          include, but are not limited to, Ag(I,III), Bi(III,V), and
          Cu(I,III) oxides. In another embodiment, the oxidation of the
          lower-valent metal ions and the reduction of the higher-valent
          metal ions result in ions having opposite oxidation states
          (e.g., ions with a +2 valence state are oxidized to +3, while
          the ions with a +3 valence state are reduced to +2). Examples
          of such an embodiment occur when the valence difference
          between the metal ions in the electron active molecular
          crystal is 1 and such examples include, but are not limited
          to, Co(II,III), Fe(II,III), Mn(II,III), and Pr(III,IV) oxides.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] The metal ion of certain electron active compounds may
          exhibit a distinct affinity for certain elements of ligands,
          for example, such as sulfur, oxygen, or nitrogen, particularly
          when present in a pathogen's cell membrane. In many cases, the
          metal ion will not merely bind to these elements, but will
          actually form chelate complexes with their ligands. The
          classic example of this is Ag(I,III) oxide, the monovalent
          silver ion of which has an affinity for sulfur and nitrogen
          and the oxidized/reduced divalent ion of which forms chelate
          complexes with, for example, mercapto or amino groups. Thus,
          the electron active compound attraction for the cell membrane
          surfaces, for example, of pathogens, is believed to be driven
          by powerful electrostatic forces.<br>

          [0044] Without being bound by theory, the electron exchange
          may be depicted, for example, by the following series of redox

          [0045] For each redox reaction, there is believed to be an
          electromotive force, which is the voltage potential of the
          oxidizing the higher-valent ion in the metal oxide crystal.
          This is denoted herein as EMF&lt;OX&gt;. In addition to the
          electromotive force of oxidation, there is believed to be an
          associated reduction reaction involving the lower-valent ion
          in the metal oxide crystal. This reduction reaction may be
          represented simply, as tabulated above, or may represent the
          interaction with, for example, a ligand present on a pathogen
          cell membrane surface, such as one containing sulfur or
          nitrogen. Associated with the reduction reaction is another
          electromotive force, or voltage potential of the reducing the
          lower-valent ion. This is denoted herein as EMF&lt;RE&gt;.<br>
          <br>
          [0046] When the metal ions of the electron active metal oxide
          interact with, for example, a sulfur-containing ligand, the
          affinity of the metal ion for sulfur affects EMF&lt;RE&gt;.
          The stability of a particular metal sulfide is an
          approximation of the affinity of a metal ion for sulfur. The
          following approximate association constants for sulfides
          indicate the trend in <span style="font-weight: bold;">relative



            affinity of each metal ion for sulfur:</span><br>

          negative its reduction potential in the reduction reaction,

          [0049] In the case of tetrasilver tetroxide, there is a
          reduction reaction where Ag(I) is oxidized and an oxidation
          reaction where Ag(III) is reduced, as follows:<br>

          [0050] The voltage that is discharged from a redox reaction of
          the electron active metal oxides of the present invention,
          which voltage is denoted herein as the "electrocution
          voltage," is the combination of the oxidizing cation's
          reduction potentials and the reducing cation's reduction

          [0051] As noted from the above table, praseodymium-, cobalt-,
          and copper-based oxides are believed to be stronger
          antipathogenic agents or to form better pharmaceutical
          compositions than manganese-, bismuth-, and iron-based oxides,
          and in one embodiment they are preferred for this reason.
          Nevertheless, in certain cases, iron exhibits stronger
          antipathogenic characteristics, particularly antimicrobial
          characteristics, compared to manganese.<br>
          <br>
          [0052] Another factor, however, particularly in antipathogenic
          or antimicrobial efficacy, can be the sulfur/nitrogen
          composition, for example, of cell membranes. For example,
          Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, in a culture having a cell
          density of 30,000 CFU/mL, exhibit significant mortality from
          exposure to 100 ppm of Bi(III,V) oxide for about 10 minutes,
          but no significant mortality from exposure to the same
          concentrations of Fe(II,III) and Mn(II,III) oxides for the
          same contact time. This result might be explained by the far
          greater stability of bismuth(III) sulfide, and thus the far
          greater affinity of bismuth(III) for sulfur, than either of
          the iron(II) or manganese(II) analogs.<br>
          <br>
          [0053] The electron active metal oxide compounds and
          compositions of the present invention may be used in any form
          which sufficiently retains their antipathogenic character, or
          other non-pathogenic ability, to prevent, treat, or manage one
          or more of the conditions noted herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0054] These compounds or compositions may be used as
          antipathogenic agents, such as antimicrobial, antibacterial,
          antiviral, or anti-algal agents, or a combination thereof. In
          another embodiment, the compounds or compositions may be used
          for preventing, treating, and/or managing various conditions
          that are non-pathogenic. For example, non-pathogenic
          conditions are believed to include certain autoimmune
          disorders, neurological disorders, and circulatory disorders.
          While the exact mechanism of the activity of such compounds or
          compositions is not described herein, nonetheless, suitable
          prevention, treatment, and/or management of such
          non-pathogenic conditions may be obtained by administering the
          compounds or compositions of the invention as described herein
          and as will be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill in
          the art.<br>

          based on the weight of the composition. In such situations, an
          oxidizing agent may be included in certain compositions of the
          invention in small amounts when the compositions are
          administered by certain routes. In such an embodiment, the
          oxidizing agent includes a peroxy acid salt, preferably a
          Group I salt of a persulfate, more preferably <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">potassium persulfate</span>. In
          another embodiment, the oxidizing agent includes the same
          peroxy acid salt which was present as a starting material in
          the reaction to form the particular electron active metal
          oxide. The oxidizing agent may advantageously be present in
          the composition in amounts from about 1 ppm to 500 ppm, based
          on the weight of the composition. In alternate embodiments,
          there may be from about 5 ppm to 200 ppm or from about 10 ppm
          to 100 ppm of oxidizing agent, based on the weight of the
          composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] It is believed that the additional presence of certain
          types or amounts of oxidizing agent(s) may tend to irritate
          the skin, particularly when the compound or composition
          including metal oxide(s) is present in large amounts, such as
          greater than 50 ppm, based on the weight of the composition.
          In one embodiment, as more compound or composition is
          administered, a correspondingly smaller amount of undesirable
          oxidizing agent is required. Thus, in some embodiments, it has
          been found that the additional oxidizing agent is unnecessary
          and in fact undesirable for the purpose of treating certain
          conditions described herein, since the additional oxide may
          have or contribute to an undesirable side effect, for example,
          such as skin irritation when applied topically. For those
          embodiments, the compositions minimize the amount of
          additional oxidizing agent, such as persulfate, or are
          substantially or completely free of added persulfates or other
          oxidizing agents.<br>
          <br>
          [0069] Certain of the electron active metal oxides may be
          black in color, such that care must be taken when formulating
          suitable topical pharmaceutical compositions according to the
          invention to inhibit blackening or superficial discoloration
          of the skin. Without being bound by theory, it is believed
          that larger amounts of such compositions promote increased
          superficial discoloration. Thus, in one embodiment, the
          pharmaceutical compositions preferably have an insufficient
          amount of metal oxide composition to cause visible skin
          discoloration.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] Additionally, it was found by rigorous testing that
          certain silver tetroxide-containing compositions were
          comparatively non-toxic compared to silver salts, such as
          conventional formulations of silver nitrate, silver
          sulfadiazine, and benzoyl peroxide. Since these silver
          tetroxide compositions were effective at certain ppm
          concentrations in killing pathogens in nutrient broth and for
          water treatment, commercial concentrates were formulated with
          2% of the tetrasilver tetroxide. For acceptance of the oxide
          in commerce, for which EPA registration No. 3432-64 was
          obtained, it was necessary for the Ag4O4 to undergo a series
          of toxicity tests. A 3% concentrate was used and evaluated by
          a certified laboratory employing good laboratory practice
          (GLP) according to the Code of Federal Regulations for this
          purpose. The results were as follows:<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute Oral Toxicity&nbsp; LD50 Greater than
          5,000 mg/Kg<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Acute Dermal Toxicity&nbsp; LD50 Greater
          than 2,000 mg/Kg<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Eye Irritation&nbsp; Mildly
          irritating<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary Skin Irritation&nbsp; No irritation<br>
          <br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Skin Sensitization&nbsp; Non-Sensitizing<br>
          <br>
          [0071] Subsequent evaluations conducted according to the
          invention showed that unless persons were prone to silver
          allergies, the pure tetrasilver tetroxide compositions
          according to the invention could be applied to the skin
          without any ill effects or evidence of irritation, despite the
          fact that the compositions of the invention can be a powerful
          oxidizing agent. This can perhaps be explained by the
          stability manifested by the KA of the tetrasilver tetroxide
          compositions, which is approximately 7.9*10&lt;-13&gt;.<br>
          <br>
          [0072] Where the electron active compositions according to the
          invention are applied to the skin, they may be combined with a
          carrier in an amount from about 5 ppm to 500,000 ppm, more
          preferably from about 50 ppm to 250,000 ppm of the electron
          active metal oxide composition, based on the weight of the
          composition. In various embodiments, the compositions are
          provided in amounts from about 400 ppm to 100,000 ppm, from
          about 1,000 ppm to 70,000 ppm, from about 10,000 ppm to 50,000
          ppm, or from about 20,000 ppm to 40,000 ppm, based on the
          weight of the composition. In one preferred embodiment, the
          compositions are formulated with about 25,000 ppm to 35,000
          ppm of metal oxide, based on the weight of the composition. It
          will be readily understood by those of ordinary skill in the
          art that the ppm concentration of electron active compound(s),
          such as metal oxide, in the composition is based on the total
          weight of the composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0073] When prevent, treating, or managing conditions, a
          preferred embodiment employs amounts of about 0.1 to 10
          percent by weight, about 0.25 to 5 percent by weight, or about
          2 to 4 percent by weight of the compounds or compositions of
          the invention. The compositions, when applied topically, can
          be applied to the skin about1 to 3 times per day until the
          condition is suitably cured or satisfactorily controlled. In
          one embodiment, the composition may generally be topically
          applied at a dosage level of from about 1 mg to 1000 mg per
          cm&lt;2 &gt;of skin surface, preferably about 10 mg to 500 mg
          per cm&lt;2 &gt;of skin surface. When applied topically, a
          preferred carrier includes petroleum jelly, such as white
          petroleum jelly. For example, a suitable white petroleum jelly
          is available from Penreco of Houston, Tex.<br>
          <br>
          [0074] Most of the metal oxide compounds for use according to
          the invention are commercially available from various sources.
          Tetrasilver tetroxide compositions for use according to the
          invention have been commercially sold under the poorly named
          "Ag(II) OXIDE" tradename. They may be obtained from Aldrich
          Chemical Co., Inc., having a place of business in Milwaukee,
          Wis. The chemical synthesis of tetrasilver tetroxide compounds
          can be performed according to the method described on page 148
          in M. Antelman, "Anti-Pathogenic Multivalent Silver Molecular
          Semiconductors," Precious Metals, vol. 16:141-149 (1992) by
          reacting silver nitrate with potassium peroxydisulfate
          according to the following equation in alkali solutions:<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0077] Tetracopper tetroxide,
            also referred to herein as Cu(I,III) oxide or Cu4O4, is a
            preferred electron active compound in accordance with the
            invention. This compound may be prepared as follows.</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0078] Suitable copper-based
            starting materials for this reaction include at least one
            copper(I)-containing material. In one embodiment, a water
            soluble copper(I) salt can be used. Typically, a water
            soluble copper(I) salt can be prepared by dissolving an
            inorganic copper(I) compound, for example, such as cuprous
            oxide, in an appropriate acid, for example, an organic acid,
            such as acetic acid. Since soluble copper(I) salts are not
            readily commercially available at the present time, however,
            a non-solvated inorganic copper(I) compound, such as cuprous
            oxide itself, can be used as the copper(I)-containing
            starting material. In addition, other copper(I)-containing
            materials, either inorganic, such as a copper(I) oxide, or
            organic, such as an organometallic copper(I) compound, or
            both, may be used, where the copper(I)-containing
            material(s) are sufficiently soluble in an aqueous or
            organic solution to allow reaction with other materials to
            form an electron active copper oxide compound.</span><br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0079] The
            copper(I)-containing starting material is combined with an
            aqueous caustic solution. This caustic solution preferably
            contains two components: a strong caustic base and a peroxy
            acid salt. Examples of suitable strong caustic bases include
            Group I and Group II hydroxides, preferably sodium hydroxide
            or potassium hydroxide. Examples of suitable peroxy acid
            salts include Group I salts of persulfates, preferably
            potassium persulfate.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0080] The copper-based
            starting material is typically the limiting reagent in such
            a preparation. The ratio of each of the components in the
            caustic solution to that of the copper-based starting
            material is theoretically set by the stoichiometry of the
            particular reaction. In one preferred embodiment, there is a
            relative molar excess, i.e., an amount more than
            stoichiometrically necessary, of each of the components in
            the caustic solution with respect to the copper-based
            starting material. When a strong caustic base and a peroxy
            acid salt are present in the caustic solution, the relative
            molar excesses of the components may be at least about 50%
            and at least about 10%, respectively, preferably at least
            about 100% and at least about 20%, respectively, more
            preferably, at least about 250% and at least about 40%,
            respectively, most preferably at least about 500% and at
            least about 75%, respectively.</span><br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0081] Generally, the
            reactants may be added together in any manner that comports
            with typical laboratory procedure. In one embodiment, the
            copper(I)-containing starting material is placed in a
            reactor, to which the strong caustic base and the peroxy
            acid salt are added, each typically in their own solutions.
            The solution containing the reactants is then typically
            heated to a temperature sufficient to activate a reaction,
            preferably sufficient to activate a reaction with no major
            undesirable side reactions or other undesirable effects,
            more preferably above about 80[deg.] C., most preferably
            about 90[deg.] C. to 95[deg.] C. The solution is heated for
            a time sufficient to facilitate the reaction, preferably to
            provide substantial completion of the reaction, preferably
            for at least about 5 minutes, more preferably for at least
            about 15 minutes, after which time the solution is allowed
            to cool or is cooled, preferably to below about 45[deg.] C.,
            more preferably to about room temperature.</span><br

            the solution, from its original color, red, to a color
            indicating a reaction has occurred, in this case black, may
            occur at the heated temperature or during or after cooling.</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0083] The purification and
            isolation of the desired product can be accomplished by any
            suitable method available to those of ordinary skill in the
            art. In the majority of situations, the desired reaction
            product is primarily a solid, but may be dissolved or
            dispersed in at least part of the solution. In one preferred
            embodiment, the solution is carefully decanted off, and then
            the remaining product is washed multiple times with
            distilled water, before being sufficiently dried. In another
            preferred embodiment, the solution is vacuum filtered to
            remove the filtrate, and the remaining product is
            sufficiently dried.</span><br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0084] The yield of solid
            tetracopper tetroxide material, based on the reactants, is
            typically at least about 10%, preferably at least about 45%,
            more preferably at least about 75%, most preferably at least

          [0086] The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of
          electron active composition(s), or a derivative thereof, in
          the acute or chronic management of diseases and disorders
          described herein will vary with the severity of the condition
          to be prevented, treated, or managed and the route of
          administration. For example, oral, mucosal (including rectal
          and vaginal), parenteral (including subcutaneous,
          intramuscular, bolus injection, and intravenous, such as by
          infusion), sublingual, transdermal, nasal, buccal, and like
          may be employed. In one embodiment, a patient may gargle using
          the composition of the present invention. Dosage forms include
          tablets, troches, lozenges, dispersions, suspensions,
          suppositories, solutions, capsules, soft elastic gelatin
          capsules, patches, and the like. The dose, and perhaps the
          dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body
          weight, and response of the individual patient. Suitable
          dosing regimens can be readily selected by those of ordinary
          skill in the art with due consideration of such factors. In
          general, the total daily dosage for the conditions described
          herein, is from about 0.1 mg to 1,000 mg of the active
          ingredient, i.e., one of the metal oxides described herein, or
          a derivative thereof. In another embodiment, the daily dosage
          can be from about 1 mg to 500 mg, while in another embodiment,
          the daily dosage can be from about 2 mg to 200 mg of the metal
          oxide composition. A unit dosage can include, for example, 30
          mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, or 300 mg of metal oxide
          composition. Preferably, the active ingredient is administered
          in single or divided doses from one to four times a day, such
          as by topical administration. In another embodiment, the
          compositions are administered by an oral route of
          administration. The oral dosage forms may be conveniently
          presented in unit dosage forms and prepared by any methods
          available to those of ordinary skill in the art of pharmacy.<br>
          <br>
          [0087] In managing the patient, the therapy may be initiated
          at a lower dose, e.g., from about 1 mg, and increased up to
          the recommended daily dose or higher depending on the
          patient's global response. It is further recommended that
          children, patients over 65 years, and those with impaired
          renal or hepatic function, initially receive low doses when
          administered systemically, and that they be titrated based on
          individual response(s) and blood level(s). It may be necessary
          to use dosages outside these ranges in some cases, as will be
          apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore,
          it is noted that the clinician or treating physician will know
          how and when to interrupt, adjust, or terminate therapy in
          conjunction with individual patient response.<br>
          <br>
          [0088] Any suitable route of administration may be employed
          for providing the patient with an effective dosage of electron
          active metal oxide, or a derivative thereof. The most suitable
          route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity
          of the condition being prevented, treated, or managed.<br>
          <br>
          [0089] In practical use, the metal oxide, or a derivative
          thereof, can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate
          admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to
          conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The
          carrier may take a wide variety of forms and may include a
          number of components depending on the form of preparation
          desired for administration. The compositions of the present
          invention may include, but are not limited to, suspensions,
          solutions and elixirs; aerosols; or carriers, including, but
          not limited to, starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose,
          diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders,
          disintegrating agents, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          [0090] Suitable forms in which the electron active compounds
          or compositions of the present invention may be used include,
          but are not limited to, powder, granule, flake, solution,
          suspension, emulsion, slurry, aerosol spray, gel, paste, and
          combinations thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the form is
          a powder or solution. When the electron active compounds are
          in the form of a solution, the solution may be aqueous,
          non-aqueous, or a combination thereof, preferably at least
          partially aqueous, more preferably substantially aqueous. In a
          preferred embodiment, the metal oxides are in an aqueous
          solution.<br>
          <br>
          [0091] The compositions of the invention may be applied
          topically, e.g., either directly as a powder or in
          non-sprayable or sprayable form. Non-sprayable forms can be
          semi-solid or solid forms including a carrier indigenous to
          topical application and preferably having a dynamic viscosity
          greater than that of water. Suitable formulations include, but
          are not limited to, suspensions, emulsions, creams, ointments,
          powders, liniments, salves and the like. If desired, these may
          be sterilized or mixed with any available auxiliary agents,
          carriers, or excipients, e.g., thixotropes, stabilizers,
          wetting agents, and the like. One or more thixotropic agents
          can be included in types and amounts sufficient to increase
          adhesion of topically applied compositions of the invention to
          the skin, so as to inhibit or prevent runoff or other loss of
          the composition from the treatment zone on the skin. Preferred
          vehicles for non-sprayable topical preparations include
          ointment bases, e.g., polyethylene glycol-1000 (PEG-1000);
          conventional ophthalmic vehicles; creams; and gels, as well as
          petroleum jelly and the like. In one more preferred
          embodiment, the carrier includes a petroleum jelly. In another
          preferred embodiment, the carrier is formulated as a cream,
          gel, or lotion. In another preferred embodiment, the carrier
          is 3 weight percent active ingredient, 36 weight percent heavy
          mineral oil, 47 weight percent petroleum jelly, and 14 weight
          percent Tivawax P, which is available from Tivian
          Laboratories, Inc., of Providence, R.I. In yet another
          preferred embodiment, the composition may be a dry powder,
          such as with 5 weight percent active ingredient and 95 weight
          percent bismuth subgallate. These topical preparations may
          also contain emollients, perfumes, and/or pigments to enhance
          their acceptability for various usages.<br>
          <br>
          [0092] The compositions may also be formulated for parenteral
          administration by injection (subcutaneous, bolus injection,
          intramuscular, or intravenous, such as by infusion), and may
          be dispensed in a unit dosage form, such as a multidose
          container or an ampule. Compositions of the electron active
          metal oxide, or a derivative thereof, for parenteral
          administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions,
          emulsions, or the like, in aqueous or oily vehicles, and in
          addition to the active ingredient may contain one or more
          formulary agents, such as dispersing agents, suspending
          agents, stabilizing agents, preservatives, and the like.<br>
          <br>
          [0093] In the case where an intravenous injection or infusion
          composition is employed, a suitable dosage range can be, e.g.,
          from about 0.5 mg (0.1 ppm) to about 1,000 mg (200 ppm) total
          dose, preferably from about 5 mg (1 ppm) to 400 mg (80 ppm).
          In one preferred embodiment, the total dose can be from about
          50 mg (10 ppm) to 200 mg (40 ppm). It should be understood
          that any suitable amount of the composition according to the
          invention may be administered if effective to prevent, treat,
          or manage one or more conditions described herein.<br>
          <br>
          [0094] Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention
          may be orally administered in discrete pharmaceutical unit
          dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, soft elastic gelatin
          capsules, tablets, or aerosols sprays, each containing a
          predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or
          granules, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous
          liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a
          water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such compositions may be
          prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods
          include the step of bringing into association the active
          ingredient with the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier which
          constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the
          compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing
          the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided
          solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the
          product into the desired presentation. Suitable types of oral
          administration include oral solid preparations, such as
          capsules or tablets, or oral liquid preparations. If desired,
          tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous
          techniques.<br>
          <br>
          [0095] For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or
          molding, optionally, with one or more accessory ingredients.
          Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a
          suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form
          such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder,
          lubricant, inert diluent, granulating agent, surface active
          agent, dispersing agent, or the like. Molded tablets may be
          made by molding, in a suitable machine, a mixture of the
          powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. In
          one embodiment, each tablet, capsule, cachet, or gel cap
          contains from about 0.5 mg to about 500 mg of the active
          ingredient, while in another embodiment, each tablet contains
          from about1 mg to about 250 mg of the active ingredient. The
          amount of active ingredient found in the composition, however,
          may vary depending on the amount of active ingredient to be
          administered to the patient.<br>
          <br>
          [0096] Another suitable route of administration is transdermal
          delivery, for example, via an abdominal skin patch.<br>
          <br>
          [0097] The metal oxide(s), or a derivative thereof, may be
          formulated as a pharmaceutical composition in a soft elastic
          gelatin capsule unit dosage form by using conventional methods
          well known in the art, such as in Ebert, Pharm. Tech,
          1(5):44-50 (1977). Soft elastic gelatin capsules have a soft,
          globular gelatin shell somewhat thicker than that of hard
          gelatin capsules, wherein a gelatin is plasticized by the
          addition of plasticizing agent, e.g., glycerin, sorbitol, or a
          similar polyol. The hardness of the capsule shell may be
          changed by varying the type of gelatin used and the amounts of
          plasticizer and water. The soft gelatin shells may contain an
          additional preservative, such as methyl- and propylparabens
          and sorbic acid, to prevent the growth of fungi, although this
          is not necessary since the compounds and compositions of the
          invention provide anti-fungal efficacy. Thus, in one
          embodiment, the invention includes a compositions formulated
          as a gelatin shell with an electron active metal oxide
          compound of the present invention, completely free of added
          preservatives. The active ingredient may be dissolved or
          suspended in a liquid vehicle or carrier, such as vegetable or
          mineral oils, glycols such as polyethylene glycol and
          propylene glycol, triglycerides, surfactants such as
          polysorbates, or a combination thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0098] In addition to the common dosage forms set out above,
          the compounds of the present invention may also be
          administered by controlled release means, delivery devices, or
          both, as are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art,
          such as those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770;
          3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533;
          5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476;
          5,354,556; and 5,733,566, the disclosures of which are hereby
          incorporated herein by express reference thereto. These
          pharmaceutical compositions can be used to provide slow or
          controlled-release of the active ingredient therein using, for
          example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose in varying proportions to
          provide the desired release profile, other polymer matrices,
          gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer
          coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or the
          like, or a combination thereof. Suitable controlled-release
          formulations available to those of ordinary skill in the art,
          including those described herein, may be readily selected for
          use with the tetrasilver tetroxide compositions of the
          invention. Thus, single unit dosage forms suitable for topical
          or oral administration, such as gels, lotions, cremes,
          tablets, capsules, gelcaps, caplets, and the like, that are
          adapted for controlled-release are encompassed by the present
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          [0099] All controlled-release pharmaceutical products have a
          common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by
          their non-controlled counterparts. Ideally, the use of an
          optimally designed controlled-release preparation in medical
          treatment is characterized by a minimum of the active
          ingredient being employed to cure or control the condition in
          a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled-release
          formulations may include: 1) extended activity of the active
          ingredient; 2) reduced dosage frequency; and 3) increased
          patient compliance.<br>
          <br>
          [0100] Most controlled-release formulations are designed to
          initially release an amount of active ingredient that promptly
          produces the desired therapeutic effect, and gradual and
          continual release of other amounts of active ingredient to
          maintain this level of therapeutic effect over an extended
          period of time. In order to maintain this constant level of
          active ingredient in the body, the active ingredient should be
          released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the
          amount of active ingredient being metabolized and excreted
          from the body.<br>
          <br>
          [0101] The controlled-release of the active ingredient may be
          stimulated by various inducers, for example pH, temperature,
          enzymes, water, or other physiological conditions or
          compounds. The term "controlled-release component" in the
          context of the present invention is defined herein as a
          compound or compounds, including polymers, polymer matrices,
          gels, permeable membranes, liposomes, microspheres, or the
          like, or a combination thereof, that facilitates the
          controlled-release of the active ingredient (e.g., tetrasilver
          tetroxide) in the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
          <br>
          [0102] The pharmaceutical compositions for use in the present
          invention include electron active metal oxides, or a
          derivative thereof, as the active ingredient, and may also
          contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and optionally,
          other therapeutic ingredients. Suitable derivatives include
          any available "pharmaceutically acceptable salts," which refer
          to a salt prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic
          acids including inorganic acids, organic acids, solvates,
          hydrates, or clathrates thereof. Examples of such inorganic
          acids are nitric, sulfuric, lactic, glycolic, salicylic, and
          phosphoric. Appropriate organic acids may be selected, for
          example, from aliphatic, aromatic, carboxylic and sulfonic
          classes of organic acids, examples of which are formic,
          acetic, propionic, succinic, camphorsulfonic, citric, fumaric,
          gluconic, isethionic, lactic, malic, mucic, tartaric,
          para-toluenesulfonic, glycolic, glucuronic, maleic, furoic,
          glutamic, benzoic, anthranilic, salicylic, phenylacetic,
          mandelic, embonic (pamoic), methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic,
          pantothenic, benzenesulfonic (besylate), stearic, sulfanilic,
          alginic, galacturonic, and the like. Particularly preferred
          acids are lactic, glycolic, and salicylic acids. The
          pharmaceutically acceptable salts preferably do not include
          halide-containing salts when tetrasilver tetroxide is present,
          as these salts are believed to facilitate breakdown of the
          oxide lattice present in the silver oxide compositions of the
          invention.<br>

          [0104] A culture of Salmonella of cell density 500,000 CFU/mL
          was contacted for 10 minutes with approximately 4 ppm
          hexapraseodymium undecoxide (Pr6O11), which is believed to

          and Pr(IV), in its crystal lattice, at a pH of about 9,
          followed with a culture adjusted to a pH of about 10. The
          percentages of bacterial colonies killed by this treatment
          were 96.4% and 93.8%, respectively. The experiment was
          repeated with the same cell density of Salmonella using about
          5 ppm of tricobalt tetroxide (Co3O4), which is believed to
          contain two distinct oxidation states of cobalt, Co(II) and
          Co(III), in its crystal lattice, at a pH of about 10. The

          cultures of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria having cell
          densities of 75,000 CFU/mL for about 10 minutes. The iron and
          manganese oxide compositions were observed to kill
          substantially no bacteria, whereas the composition containing
          dibismuth tetroxide was observed to kill about 37.3% of the
          bacteria.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">The present invention relates
            to the employment of trivalent copper, i.e., Cu(III)
            compounds, as bactericidal and algicidal agents in water
            treatment. The instant inventor has been involved over the
            past years in searching out new compounds which are anti
            pathogenic and which can be utilized for water treatment.
            The inventor's efforts have concentrated upon multivalent
            silver compounds. To date seven patents have been granted to
            the inventor in this area as follows: U.S. Pat. Nos.
            5,017,295; 5,073,382; 5,078,902; 5,089,275; 5,098,582;
            5,211,855; and 5,223,149. The last patent deals with the
            efficacy of trivalent silver in water treatment and is
            entitled TRIVALENT SILVER WATER TREATMENT COMPOSITIONS. Said
            invention deals with trivalent silver compounds which are
            very effective as bactericides, bacteriostats, algistats and
            algicides. Having completed his research in this area, it
            occurred to the inventor that it may be possible that
            trivalent copper compounds could also exhibit this behavior.
            However, such a conclusion was not obvious.</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">The reason that such a
            conclusion was not obvious was that it would be entirely
            possible that Cu(III) compounds could not necessarily be
            expected to exhibit all or some of the behavior of Ag(III)
            compounds of an anti-pathogenic nature.</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Accordingly, it was decided
            to investigate the possibility. The reason why such an
            investigation was undertaken was that if it were ascertained
            that there was anti-pathogenic efficacy with Cu(III)
            compounds, then it could be entirely possible that said
            compounds would offer an economic advantage on a cost
            effective basis if proven out, since copper is far less
            expensive than silver. The scientific literature was
            subsequently scrutinized in order to find suitable trivalent
            copper candidates for synthesis and subsequent tests and
            evaluations. Accordingly, trivalent Cu(III) compounds were
            selected from the literature for further study and
            subsequent synthesis. The inventor also synthesized other
            Cu(III) compounds not found in the literature of his own
            creation. After having accomplished the synthesis of several
            of these trivalent Cu compounds, those meeting certain
            criteria, e.g. highest yields were submitted for testing and
            evaluation as potential bactericides, bacteriostats,
            algicides and algistats. However, it was not enough that
            these compounds kill and inhibit the growth of both bacteria
            and algae, but it is also necessary that said compounds
            perform the function within a specific time frame as
            demanded by US Federal standards in conformity with
            protocols of the Environmental Protection Agency as
            engendered and defined by the Code of Federal Regulations
            (CFR) for utilitarian bodies of water of which swimming
            pools is exemplary.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">The evaluations of the
            Cu(III) compositions proved highly successful. Furthermore,
            while it is known that divalent copper compounds exhibit
            useful algicidal and algistatic properties, no copper (II)
            compound is known to be active as a bacteriostat or
            bactericide at copper concentrations below 10 PPM, let alone
            to exhibit said characteristics at any concentration in
            conformity with the aforementioned specifications defined in
            the CFR. Accordingly, this invention perfected copper (III)
            compounds for all these functions and offered the previously
            outlined economic advantages over the inventor's Ag(III)
            compounds.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
          <br>
          The main object of this invention is to provide compositions
          embodying trivalent copper compounds capable of killing and/or
          inhibiting the growth of bacteria and algae, particularly in
          utilitarian bodies of water, that is, bodies of water having a
          particular use, such as swimming pools, hot tubs,
          drinking-water reservoirs, recreational lakes and industrial
          cooling towers.<br>
          <br>
          Another object of the invention is to provide a source of
          trivalent copper ions capable of meeting regular CFR and EPA
          standards for swimming pools and hot tubs, mainly, a
          bactericide capable of achieving 100% kills within 10 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          Still another object of the invention is to provide a
          trivalent copper composition having the aforesaid function but
          which can be formulated into a marketable concentrated liquid
          product for utilization in utilitarian bodies of water.<br>
          <br>
          Other objects, features, functions and characteristics of the
          present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the
          art when the present invention is considered in view of the
          accompanying examples. It should, of course, be recognized
          that the accompanying examples illustrate preferred
          embodiments of the present invention and are not intended as a
          means of defining the limits and scope of the present
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          This invention relates to the utilization of trivalent copper
          compounds for bactericidal and algicidal applications in
          utilitarian bodies of water, such as swimming pools, hot tubs,
          municipal and industrial water supplies, as for example,
          cooling towers.<br>
          <br>
          More specifically, this invention concerns stable Cu(III)
          complexes. Said complexes are designated via the principal
          quantum number (n), being equal to 3 and the second quantum
          number (1) being equal to 2. The letter "l" delineates
          sublevel d electrons. According to the accepted conventional
          designation, trivalent copper complexes are called d@8
          complexes; while divalent and monovalent copper are designated
          d@9 and d@10 complexes, respectively.<br>
          <br>
          Trivalent copper complexes were prepared by various routes of
          synthesis. However, irrespective of the manner of preparation,
          all the methods chosen utilized copper sulfate as the starting
          material source of copper (II) ions and sodium or potassium
          persulfate as the oxidizing agent for changing Cu(II)
          complexes to Cu(III).<br>
          <br>
          Of all the Cu(III) compounds prepared three criteria were used
          to select preferred compounds for evaluation against bacteria
          and algae. The criteria were as follows:<br>
          <br>
          1. Ease of preparation.<br>
          <br>
          2. Yield of compound.<br>
          <br>
          3. Uniformity and aesthetic nature of appearance.<br>
          <br>
          Accordingly, those final compounds which were chosen for the
          testing were a Cu(III) periodate complex; the 1:1
          Cu(III)/ligand complex of tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane;
          and the 1:2 Cu(III)/ligand complexes of biuret and
          dimethylglyoxime.<br>
          <br>
          The compounds chosen were prepared according to methods of
          preparation described in the literature excepting that of the
          tris amino complex, for which no preparative method could be
          found in the literature. The latter was prepared by a route
          original with the inventor.<br>
          <br>
          The Cu(III) periodate complexes can be depicted by the
          following structure: ##STR1##<br>
          <br>
          The particular complex prepared here has the following
          formula:<br>
          <br>
          K2 Na3 H2 [Cu(IO6)2 ]<br>
          <br>
          It is prepared according to the reaction:<br>
          <br>
          2CuSO4 +2Na2 S2 O8 +14NaOH+4KIO4 =2K2 Na3 H2 [Cu(IO6)2 ]+5H2
          O+6Na2 SO4<br>
          <br>
          This compound was prepared according to the method of Keyworth
          &amp; Stone (Analytical Chemistry, Vol. 27 p.833 [1955])
          excepting that the potassium persulfate described in the
          recipe was replaced with its molar equivalent of sodium
          persulfate to yield a rich deep brown solution of the
          diperiodo cuprate(III).<br>
          <br>
          As for the nitrogen complex cuprate (III) compounds of biuret
          and dimethylglyoxime they were prepared by the persulfate
          oxidation of the Cu(II) chelate complexes. Thus the biuret
          complexes were prepared according to J.J. Bour et al.,
          Inorganic Chemistry, Vol. 10, No. 6, 1971. The 2:1 ligand/Cu
          ratio complex can be depicted by the following structure:
          ##STR2##<br>
          <br>
          The Cu dimethylglyoxime complexes were prepared according to
          the method of Morpurgo and Tomlinson (J. Chem. Soc., Dalton
          Trans., p. 744-51 [1977]).<br>
          <br>
          A probable structure for the Cu(III) dimethylglyoxime
          complexes depicted in the aforementioned paper is shown below:<br>

            EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Illustrative of the preferred embodiments of this invention
          are the following examples.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 1</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          A Cu(III) biuret chelate complex having a 2:1 ligand to Cu
          ratio was prepared by adding 2.2 grams of biuret with stirring
          to 100 cc. of 2.5% cupric sulfate pentahydrate solution in
          distilled water followed by 3.0 grams of reagent-grade KOH.
          Upon addition of the biuret to the copper sulfate, it remained
          in suspension until the KOH was added. Then the entire
          material went into solution as the Cu(II) biuret complex with
          a clear violet color. Upon addition of reagent-grade potassium
          persulfate to the heated complex at 90-95 DEG C., an insoluble
          brown solid was obtained. It was separated by vacuum
          filtration and dried. It assayed 20.9% Cu and was obtained in
          a yield of 73%.<br>
          <br>
          The tests were as follows. Plate colonies were grown of fecal
          coliform cultures in a 10 PPM sodium persulfate solution,
          which is an optimum concentrate of a preferred synergistic
          sanitizer enhancement agent used in conventional swimming
          pools. The control colonies per plate after five minutes were
          150. Plates which were treated in like manner with the Cu(III)
          biuret chelate complex, where the Cu(III) ion concentration
          was 9 PPM, exhibited 100% inhibition of the colonies. The
          aforementioned coliform inhibitory evaluations were performed
          at an EPA certified laboratory.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 2</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          A copper (III) tris amino complex was prepared in which the
          Cu:Ligand ratio was 1:1 in the following manner. 1.3 grams of
          tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane were added with stirring to
          100 cc of a 2.5% cupric sulfate pentahydrate solution in
          distilled water. This was followed with 2.0g. of reagent-grade
          KOH which was added to the mixture. The solution changed to a
          deep blue color. The resulting solution was then heated to 90
          DEG-95 DEG C. and 3.5g. of reagent-grade potassium persulfate
          were added with stirring. A dark-brown precipitate resulted
          which was filtered and dried. The yield of the product was 65%
          which assayed at 34.0% copper. The resulting compound was
          subjected to the same protocol described in Example 1 with the
          same culture control. The results were identical at the same 9
          PPM Cu(III) ion concentration.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 3</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          A Cu(III) periodate complex was prepared as follows 2.0g of
          cupric sulfate pentahydrate were dissolved in 150 cc. of
          distilled water, 9.2g. of potassium periodate (reagent grade)
          were added to the solution and 24 cc. of 45% KOH was then
          added. This was followed by the addition of 8.4g. of sodium
          persulfate to the solution which was heated to 90 DEG-95 DEG
          C. The solution was subsequently cooled to room temperature
          and filtered. After removal of insoluble solid matter, the
          remaining solution was diluted to 200ml. volume in a
          volumetric flask and assayed via AA spectroscopy. The yield of
          Cu(III) periodate was 30%. Aliquots of this solution were
          taken for subsequent pathogenic evaluations.<br>
          <br>
          An EPA certified laboratory evaluated the periodate utilizing
          E. coli plate colony cultures in a manner analogous to that
          described in Example 1, excepting that the controls were done
          without any sodium persulfate present. Under these conditions
          there were 111 control colonies after 10 minutes; and 100%
          inhibition of E. coli colonies with only 5.0 PPM of Cu(III)
          ion applied as periodate.<br>
          <br>
          Another EPA certified laboratory subsequently evaluated the
          Cu(III) periodate complex for inhibiting the growth of algae.
          The protocol utilized was the Selanastrum range finding test.
          Plotting the data from the test at prechosen Cu(III) ion
          concentrations indicated a 100% inhibition at 11 PPM in the
          presence of 10 PPM sodium persulfate. There was no algae
          growth inhibition in blanks run with sodium persulfate as
          controls.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          This invention relates to textile articles possessing
          antimicrobial properties and a method for their preparation.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Description of Related Art</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Textile articles which have been treated to render such
          articles microbicidal to microorganisms coming in contact with
          the article are known in the prior art. Such articles include
          those made from paper, fibers, woven and non-woven textiles
          and like fabrics which are designed for use in environments
          such as hospitals, food processing plants, laboratories and
          other areas where maintenance of germ-free conditions is
          essential.<br>
          <br>
          For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,791,518 discloses a method of
          imparting microbicidal properties to articles such as textiles
          by immersing the article in a first aqueous solution
          containing a water-soluble basic nitrogen compound (ammonia)
          and a monovalent silver salt soluble in said solution,
          followed by a second immersion in a second solution containing
          a second salt capable of ion exchange with the silver salt
          such that a monovalent silver salt precipitate is formed
          within the article. The formed silver precipitate is sparingly
          water soluble and imparts microbicidal properties to the
          articles so treated.<br>
          <br>
          Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,271,952 discloses a method of
          treating fibers to render them electrically conductive as well
          as anti-bacterial comprising immersing the fibers in a bath
          comprising an aqueous solution of a source of divalent copper
          ions, a reducing agent, sodium thiosulfate and a source of
          iodide ions, whereby copper iodide is adsorbed into the
          fibers. Similar techniques for rendering fibers conductive
          and/or resistant to bacteria involving the use of copper
          compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,410,593 and
          5,458,906.<br>
          <br>
          One of the main problems associated with the use of monovalent
          silver compounds such as the halides, phosphates or sulfates
          in such applications is that they are sensitive to
          ultra-violet light and are thus prone to discoloration after
          exposure to sunlight, with a gradual loss of effectiveness of
          antimicrobial properties. Also, many of these compounds are
          soluble or slightly soluble in hot water which diminishes the
          antimicrobial properties after only a few launderings of
          reusable fabrics containing them.<br>
          <br>
          Another problem with respect to the use of copper compounds as
          interstitially precipitated antimicrobials such as described
          in the above U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,271,952 and 5,458,906 is that
          these processes do not readily lend themselves to inclusion in
          textile production lines. Textile finishing lines involve
          processes which take minutes and cannot readily accommodate
          precipitations which require lengthy immersion times of sixty
          minutes or more.<br>
          <br>
          The main object of the invention is to provide a method of
          treating fibers and/or configurated textile products so that
          anti-microbial properties are imparted to them. Another object
          of the invention is to incorporate into said fibers and
          textile products a powerful anti-microbial based on an
          electron active molecular crystal analogous to the molecular
          crystal, tetrasilver tetroxide, which has been proven one of
          the most powerful disinfectants known to man.<br>
          <br>
          Another object of the invention is to form a multivalent cobal
          oxide by interstitial precipitation.<br>
          <br>
          Still another object of the invention is to enable rapid mass
          production of anti-microbial fibers and textile products.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The invention provides a fibrous textile article containing a
          cobalt (II, III) oxide as an antimicrobial agent
          interstitially deposited within said article, said agent
          present in said article in an amount sufficient to impart
          antimicrobial properties to said article.<br>
          <br>
          The invention also provides a process for imparting
          antimicrobial properties to a fibrous textile article
          comprising:<br>
          <br>
          a. providing a solution containing divalent cobalt cations;<br>
          <br>
          b. contacting said article with said solution for a period of
          time sufficient to uniformly wet said article with said
          solution;<br>
          <br>
          c. immersing said wetted article in a bath containing a second
          aqueous solution containing a strong alkali and a water
          soluable per-acid salt oxidizer for a period of time
          sufficient to interstitially precipitate cobalt (II, III)
          oxide within said article; and<br>
          <br>
          d. removing said article from said bath.<br>
          <br>
          Textile articles prepared in accordance with this invention,
          particularly woven and non-woven fabrics, exhibit outstanding
          antimicrobial resistance with respect to pathogens such as
          bacteria, viruses, yeast and algae, are resistant to
          degradation upon exposure to sunlight (ultraviolet light) and
          maintain their excellent antimicrobial properties even after a
          number of launderings.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
            INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Imparting anti-microbial (anti-pathogenic) properties to fiber
          and its derived textile products is achieved in the instant
          invention by interstitial precipitation of a molecular crystal
          compound multivalent cobalt oxide such as cobalt (II, III)
          oxide. Said cobalt moiety is based on concepts derived by
          analogy from silver (I, III) oxide which is the subject of
          patents by the instant inventor, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.
          5,336,499. That patent describes the antipathogenic properties
          of silver oxide whose formula Ag4 O4 and mechanism of
          operation as a molecular device, based on a unique crystal
          having two monovalent silver (Ag I) ions and two trivalent
          silver (Ag III) ions in the molecule, have been fully
          described in said patent, as well as the mechanism of killing
          pathogens described therein being based on the differential
          silver electronic activity between Ag(I) and Ag(III),
          resulting in. electrocution of pathogens followed by binding
          chelation of pathogenic surfaces. By extrapolating these
          elucidated concepts, the instant inventor found that cobalt
          (II, III) oxide (Co3 O4) was capable of killing pathogens in a
          like manner.<br>
          <br>
          An antimicrobial spectrum of Ag4 O4 is to be found in a
          published article written by the instant inventor in the
          annual R&amp;D issue of Soap Cosmetics Chemical Specialties
          1994, 70, 3 p. 52-59 entitled "Silver (II, III)
          Disinfectants", shown in Table 1. The spectrum is based on
          specifications of the Association of Official Analytical
          Chemists (AOAC).<br>

          The term "fibrous textile article" as used herein is intended
          to encompass a wide variety of materials including paper,
          natural or synthetic fibers, threads and yarns made from
          materials such as cotton, rayon, wool, jute, nylon,
          polyesters, polyacetates, polyacrylics as well as cellulosics
          in general. More particularly, the term refers to fibers woven
          into a fabric such as knitting, and non-woven fabrics or
          webbing used in anti-pathogenic applications such as in the
          medical field, hospitals, biotechnology and food and dairy
          processing. Exemplary textile products of this genre include
          bandages, gauze, bandage pads, skin patches, work clothes
          (both disposable and reusable), bed sheets, masks, dust
          cloths, safety belts, surgical gowns, ambulance blankets,
          stretchers, filter materials, diapers, underwear, pajamas,
          video display terminal screens and the like.<br>
          <br>
          For some antimicrobial applications, Co3 O4 crystals may be
          deposited within the interstices of fibrous articles by simply
          soaking the article in an aqueous dispersion of the crystals
          (dimension of less than 100 Angstroms), or by combining the
          crystals with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier medium and
          applying this composition to the fibrous article. This method
          of physical incorporation of the crystals is useful where the
          article is composed of low density or loosely associated
          fibers such as bandage pads, gauze pads and loosely non-woven
          products, and particularly laminated products wherein the
          treated fibrous article is subsequently sandwiched between
          layers which tend to keep the crystals trapped in the fibrous
          article. Also, antimicrobial paper products may be made by
          simply mixing an aqueous dispersion of the Co3 O4 crystals
          with paper pulp prior to calendaring the pulp.<br>
          <br>
          However, physical incorporation of the crystals is less
          effective where the treated article is a fiber or yarn or a
          higher density woven or non-woven fabric, since the pre-formed
          crystals cannot sufficiently penetrate into the interstices of
          such articles. In such cases, deposition via interstitial
          precipitation is preferred.<br>
          <br>
          Interstitial precipitation of Co3 O4 crystals (generally
          having an average dimension of less than 100 Angstroms) is
          accomplished by first providing a solution containing a source
          of divalent cobalt cations. Next the article to be treated,
          e.g., a fiber, yarn or a woven or non-woven fabric, is
          thoroughly wetted with this solution such that the article
          absorbs solution on fiber surfaces as well at one or more of
          the interstices between fibrils forming the fiber, between
          fibers forming the yarn or non-woven fabric, or between the
          weft and warp yarns present in woven fabrics. Wetting may be
          accomplished by uniformly spraying the article or more
          preferably by dipping the article in a bath of the cobalt salt
          solution for a period of time sufficient for the article to
          absorb the requisite amount of cobalt salt solution. This time
          may range from about 15-60 seconds, more preferably about 30
          seconds.<br>
          <br>
          Next the wetted article is removed from the immersion bath and
          optionally squeezed to remove excess solution and immersed in
          a bath containing a second aqueous solution comprising a
          strong alkali and a water soluble per-acid salt oxidizer for a
          period of time sufficient to cause reaction leading to the
          interstitial precipitation of Co3 O4 crystals in the
          interstices of the fibrous article. Suitable alkalis for this
          purpose include sodium or potassium hydroxide, with sodium
          hydroxide most preferred. Suitable oxidizing per-acids include
          alkali metal persulfates. Sodium and more preferably potassium
          persulfate is the preferred oxidizer. Reactions in the bath
          may be accomplished at room temperature or by heating at a
          temperature of up to 95 DEG C. for a period of time sufficient
          to maximize yield of Co3 O4, generally from about 30 seconds
          to about 4 minutes, preferably about two minutes,<br>
          <br>
          After the reaction is completed, the treated article is
          removed from the bath and may be washed several times with
          water to remove soluble inpurities or unreacted reagant.<br>
          <br>
          The quantity of Co3 O4 crystals present in the resulting
          article will generally be a function of the quantity of cobalt
          salt sorbed by the article, which can vary depending on the
          nature of the article, e.g., loose vs. tight weave fabrics or
          whether the fiber is natural or synthetic, the former being
          more absorbtive of the cobalt salt solution.<br>
          <br>
          In general, the quantity of alkali present in the second bath
          should be sufficient to maintain a pH on the basic side, i.e.,
          above about 9. The content of Co3 O4 crystals interstitially
          precipitated within any given fibrous article may be
          controlled by varying the concentration of the cobalt salt in
          the solution used to first wet the article.<br>
          <br>
          The antimicrobial properties of the articles treated in this
          invention may be further enhanced by including a source of
          fluoride ions in the second oxidizing bath described above.
          Such sources include water soluble fluoride salts such as
          sodium or potassium fluoride. The amount of fluoride anion
          source may generally range from about 10 to 1500 mg per liter
          of solution, more preferably from about 100 to 1000 mg/liter.<br>
          <br>
          The content of the Co3 O4 (based on weight PPM cobalt) in the
          fabric may range from as little as 0.5 weight PPM up to about
          15,000 weight PPM, based on the weight of the textile article.
          The minimum content should be sufficient to kill pathogens
          from which protection is sought, whereas the maximum content
          is dictated by factors such as economy and affect on fabric
          properties. Generally speaking, the higher the cobalt content,
          the more effective will be the antimicrobial properties of the
          fabric. For most applications, cobalt content in the range of
          from about 1000 to about 15,000 weight PPM will provide
          satisfactory antimicrobial properties.<br>
          <br>
          Antimicrobial properties are evaluated in accordance with this
          invention using the Association of Official Analytical
          Chemists (AOAC) test method 972.04, which is used primarily to
          evaluate the bacteriostatic activity of laundry additive
          disinfectants. In this test, a square sterile swatch of fabric
          is pressed into a petri dish containing a layer of nutrient
          agar which has been inoculated with a pathogen. Following a
          fixed period of incubation, each fabric sample is evaluated by
          measuring the clear zones adjacent the four sides of each test
          swatch as an index of antimicrobial activity. The presence of
          clear zones along all four sides of the swatch is indicative
          of antimicrobial activity, rated 4/4. The width of the clear
          zones in millimeters is reasonably indicative of the degree of
          antimicrobial activity.<br>
          <br>
          In the following examples, assorted fibers and textile
          swatches were dipped for different periods of time into cobalt
          chloride solutions of varying concentrations. The take-up of
          cobalt ions was determined by gravimetric means on an
          analytical balance, so that for each fiber and textile swatch
          so treated the exact amount of cobalt in PPM was known. Said
          fibers were then dipped into an aqueous mixture of sodium
          hydroxide and potassium persulfate for various periods of
          time. The sequential treatment was designed to fort Co3 O4 via
          the mechanism of interstitial precipitation in the fibers and
          fiber components of the textiles utilized according to the
          equation:<br>
          <br>
          3Co(NO3)2 +6K2 S2 O8 +18NaOH=9H2 O+5[0]+Co3 O4 +3K2 SO4 +6KNO3
          +9Na2 SO4<br>
          <br>
          The fibers comprising the materials utilized in the
          anti-pathogenic treatments were of polyester and nylon. Of the
          fabrics tested, both predyed goods and undyed virgin materials
          were evaluated. The AOAC anti-pathogenic tests on said fibers
          and textiles were performed by an independent laboratory which
          was licensed by a State environmental regulatory body. The
          marker organisms used in conformity with AOAC test method
          972.04 were Pseudemonas aeruginosa (pa) as the Gram negative
          bacteria marker, and Staphylococcus aureus (Staph) for Gram
          positive bacteria.<br>
          <br>
          The tests were conducted in terms of inhibition of cultures of
          said bacteria. Swatches were used for the tests in contact
          with the cultures. Each swatch had four sides and two swatches
          were used with each representative culture so that a total of
          eight trials were reflected with each bacterium. An 8/8
          inhibition would indicate 100% efficacy. However, the test
          protocol went beyond the specifications of the AOAC methods
          insofar that the actual average inhibition zone in millimeters
          was recorded for both swatches tested. Accordingly, 8/8
          positive results were obtained with the marker bacteria
          cultures. These results were then combined with the
          aforementioned anti-microbial spectrum shown in Table 1 which
          includes the marker bacteria of the AOAC tests, and
          extrapolated. The conclusion was that the preferred
          embodiments of the instant invention were 100% effective
          against the listed Table 1 microbes.<br>
          <br>
          The following examples are illustrative of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 1</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          A swatch of virgin nylon webbing of a standard size,
          2.0.times.5.0 millimeters, was taken and immersed in a cobalt
          chloride solution containing 10,850 PPM of cobalt for 30
          seconds. A gravimetric determination of the cobalt absorbed
          after immersion showed Co at 9,363 PPM in the webbing. The
          webbing was then immersed in a room temperature solution
          containing 50.0 grams/liter potassium persulfate and 22.5
          grams/liter sodium hydroxide for two minutes. It was removed,
          washed and dried. There resulted a dark brown coating on the
          fibers. The swatch was divided in thirds to give three
          swatches, two for testing in compliance with the
          aforementioned AOAC bacterial test 972.04. Zones of inhibition
          were obtained on all eight sides, i.e., 8/8, for both marker
          organisms. The average inhibition zones were 1.0 mm for
          pseudomonas aeruginosa and 1.1 for Staph aureus.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 2</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Example 1 was repeated in all aspects excepting that the
          solution chemistries were changed and immersion time in
          oxidizer was reduced to one minute. Cobalt as chloride was
          5,400 PPM. Co on fabric was 4,222 PPM. The oxidizer persulfate
          was identical to Example 1 excepting that 600 mg per liter of
          sodium fluoride were added. The results for the Staph marker
          bacteria were 8/8. The average inhibition zones was 2.0 mm.
          The addition of fluoride enhanced the efficacy of the fibers
          against Staph as seen in the inhibition zone being higher than
          in Example 1 with only 45% of the cobalt concentration that
          was effective in Example 1.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 3</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          An independent medical researcher in Israel obtained a very
          virulent strain of Staph from a patient at the Shaarei Tzedek
          Hospital in Jerusalem. The patient subsequently died from the
          infection. This strain was evaluated as more virulent than any
          of the other Staph micro-organisms listed in Table 1 by the
          pathology staff at the Jerusalem hospital. This Staph strain
          was utilized as the Staph source by the researcher who
          performed the aforementioned AOAC test 972.04 for bacterial
          retardation efficacy on the third swatch set aside in Example
          1. Since there was only one swatch, there were only four sides
          to be reckoned with. The virulent strain of Staph was
          inhibited 100% giving a reading of 4/4. The average inhibition
          for the 4/4 result was 1.5 mm. Since the virulent strain of
          Staph qualified on a silver (I, III) oxide scale as having an
          MIC of 30.5-61 PPM, the values were extrapolated for all Gram
          positive bacteria listed in Table 1. It was concluded that
          precipitated Co (II, III) oxide was capable of inhibiting all
          of the listed Gram positive bacteria. By applying the same
          reasoning to the Gram negative microorganisms of Example 1 pa
          marker, one can claim inhibition as well for all Gram negative
          bacteria listed in Table 1.<br>

          Fabrics treated in accordance with this invention hold promise
          for many antimicrobial applications ranging from preventing
          jock itch when applied to athletic supporters to preventing
          scabies and bed sores with treated bed sheets or hospital
          gowns used in nursing homes and hospitals.<br>
