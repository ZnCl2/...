      <div align="center"><b>THE 'PHILLIPS METHOD' HYDROGEN GENERATOR</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      January 19, 2014, 1:52am ET -- The 10th HHO Games - billed as the
      Green Energy Expo at the suggestion of Richard Keough and Michael
      D'Agostino - was a little disappointing in terms of the turnout
      Friday and Sunday, and a little overwhelming on Saturday.<br>
      <br>
      That's when the most important presentation in our history was
      offered on behalf of Dr. Howard Phillips by Patrick Gaddy, the
      Savannah architect who brought the science and hardware of Dr.
      Phillips' Carbon Catalyst Hydrogen on Demand (CC-HOD) generator -
      known as the Phillips Method - down to earth for all of us. His
      presentation was clear, concise and illuminating, qualities much
      appreciated by his sizeable audience, the largest of the weekend.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Phillips appeared via Skype, as did his associate Shields Fair
      of Scottsdale, Ariz., a longtime member of the American Hydrogen
      Assn., on Sunday. Both men were in Scottsdale during the Jan.
      10-12 weekend.<br>
      <br>
      The tricky Skype connection was masterfully guided by HHO Games
      volunteer Ken Sagester of Clearwater, who with Richard May of St.
      Petersburg, Fla., performed a goodly number of small miracles that
      kept the Games running smoothly.<br>
      <br>
      Gabet123 of HODINFO fame also participated in the presentation,
      making it also the most extensive in Games history.<br>
      <br>
      Using the example of a mid-sized seagoing oil tanker, Gaddy and
      Phillips explained how the new generator Phillips invented could
      substitute hydrogen for much of the heavy, polluting fossil fuel
      it uses now. Dr. Phillips' detailed calculations yielded an
      estimate of $29,000 a day in savings over the cost of using the
      typical bunker oil fuel when it is laced with the hydrogen output
      of the Phillips Method generator. The hydrogen generator would
      also free up the vast amount of space on the tanker required to
      store the bunker oil.<br>
      <br>
      The former Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University
      of North Carolina (Charlotte) took numerous questions from the
      audience, mostly about the practical applications of the device.
      Among those that he identified were automotive, rail and even
      aviation uses, as well as heating and/or power generation (from
      turbines) of large manufacturing, storage or assembly plants and
      warehouses.<br>
      <br>
      As Dr. Phillips and Patrick Gaddy pointed out, the water necessary
      to fuel the generator can come from the ocean, and the carbon
      catalyst is abundant and cheap. While a substantial quantity of
      aluminum powder or shavings would be required to fuel it, too, the
      cost would be far less than the conventional cost of fueling such
      a tanker.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Phillips, responding to a question, said he thought it was
      "unlikely" that his device would create a trade war beween stored
      and on-demand sources of hydrogen. The plan, as outlined by Dr.
      Phillips and Patrick Gaddy, calls for a manufacturer to license
      the CC-HOD process and then to build a device that can serve in a
      wide variety of applications on land, at sea or in the sky...<br>

          </b><b>CATALYSTS AND FUELS FOR PRODUCING HYDROGEN</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Exemplary embodiments of methods and systems for hydrogen
      production using an electro-activated material (catalyst) are
      provided. The catalysts can be chosen from various elements that
      have characteristics that fall within a particular range. In some
      exemplary embodiments, a material can be electro-activated and
      used as a catalyst in a chemical reaction with a fuel such as
      water or another hydrogen containing molecule. Another fuel can
      also be added, such as aluminum, to generate hydrogen. Controlling
      the temperature of the reaction, the amount of the catalyst and/or
      the amounts of aluminum can provide hydrogen on demand at a
      desired rate of hydrogen generation<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present disclosure relates to exemplary embodiments of
      catalysts and fuels for producing hydrogen, and more particularly,
      to exemplary embodiments of methods and systems for producing
      hydrogen from chemical reactions involving various catalysts and
      fuels.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Hydrogen can be considered to be a promising energy
      alternative to carbon-based fuels. Various technologies have been
      developed regarding the production and use of hydrogen as a fuel
      or energy source. While hydrogen may be considered to be a clean
      and desirable energy alternative to carbon-based fuels, various
      obstacles may exist in relying on hydrogen as an energy source as
      opposed to other forms of energy. Such obstacles may generally
      include the ability to efficiently, safely and economically
      produce, transport and store hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] One approach to producing hydrogen can include
      thermochemical processes. One such process can include carrying
      out chemical reactions between a sulfur-iodine compound and water
      at high temperatures (e.g., above approximately 800 degrees C.).
      Generally, the process can result in the splitting of the water
      molecules (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The
      sulfur-iodine solution can be recycled in the process and
      therefore, other than hydrogen and oxygen, there may be no harmful
      byproducts.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another approach to producing hydrogen can include the
      electrolysis of water. Electrolysis requires the use of
      electricity, in accordance with Faraday's Law. Electrolysis can be
      a relatively inefficient process for producing hydrogen without
      the aid of another energy source (beyond the supply of
      electricity). Indeed, the energy consumed may be more valuable
      than the hydrogen produced. In order to make electrolysis an
      economically viable process, another energy source can be
      incorporated into the process. For example, high-temperature
      electrolysis utilizes a high-temperature heat source to heat the
      water and effectively reduce the amount of electrical energy
      required to split the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen
      with higher efficiencies. Another approach can involve the
      extraction of hydrogen from fossil fuels, such as natural gas or
      methanol. This method can be complex and result in residues, such
      as carbon dioxide. Also, there is a worldwide limit to the amount
      of fossil fuel available for use in the future.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Other approaches are needed to address hydrogen production,
      such that the hydrogen production may be carried out in an
      effective, efficient and safe manner. A hydrogen-based economy can
      be a long-term, environmentally-benign energy alternative for
      sustainable growth. An increasing demand for hydrogen may arise as
      the worldwide need for more electricity increases, greenhouse gas
      emission controls tighten, and fossil fuel reserves wane.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] At least some of the above described problems can be
      addressed by exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems
      according to the present disclosure. The present disclosure
      describes exemplary embodiments of methods and systems that can
      produce hydrogen on demand (HOD) using various catalysts and
      fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to one exemplary embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a method of producing a catalyst for hydrogen
      production is provided, comprising providing a material having an
      absolute magnitude of a difference in electronegativities between
      the material and hydrogen of between approximately 0.08 to
      approximately 0.36, and providing electrical energy to the
      material to electro-activate the material, using the
      electro-activated material to produce hydrogen. The material can
      be provided in a liquid composition comprising water.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The method can further comprise determining whether the
      material has a catalyst hydride dissociation energy between
      approximately 0 to approximately 100 kcal/mol. The method can
      further comprise determining whether the material has a difference
      in electronegativities between atoms in a polar oxide molecule on
      a surface of the material between approximately 0.3 to
      approximately 1.4. The material can be carbon or lead.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] According to another exemplary embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a method of producing hydrogen is provided, comprising
      determining whether a material has an absolute magnitude of a
      difference in electronegativities between the material and
      hydrogen of between approximately 0.08 to approximately 0.36,
      electro-activating the material if the material has the absolute
      magnitude of a difference in electronegativities between the
      material and hydrogen of between approximately 0.08 to
      approximately 0.36, combining an electro-activated material with a
      hydrogen containing molecule, and generating a chemical reaction
      between the combination of electro-activated material and the
      hydrogen containing molecule to release a hydrogen atom from the
      hydrogen containing molecule.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The method can further comprise determining whether the
      material has a catalyst hydride dissociation energy between
      approximately 0 to approximately 100 kcal/mol before
      electro-activating the material. The method can further comprise
      determining whether the material has a difference in
      electronegativities between atoms in a polar oxide molecule on a
      surface of the material between approximately 0.3 to approximately
      1.4 before electro-activating the material. The method can further
      comprise combining the electro-activated material and hydrogen
      containing molecule with a fuel, and generating a chemical
      reaction between the combination of the electro-activated
      material, hydrogen containing molecule and fuel to produce
      hydrogen. The fuel can be one of pure aluminum, aluminum powder,
      aluminum granules or aluminum shavings.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The method can further comprise controlling the chemical
      reaction of the combination of electro-activated material,
      hydrogen containing molecule and fuel to produce hydrogen on
      demand by heating the combination to increase the production of
      hydrogen, and by cooling the combination to decrease the
      production of hydrogen. The combination can be heated to a
      temperature range between approximately 150 degrees Fahrenheit to
      approximately 190 degrees Fahrenheit. The hydrogen containing
      molecule can comprise water, tap water, dirty water, high-calcium
      water, salt water, sea water, alkaline water or acidic water. The
      material can be catalyzed aluminum, carbon or lead.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] According to another exemplary embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a system for producing hydrogen is provided,
      comprising a vessel having a hydrogen containing molecule and an
      electro-activated material known to have an absolute magnitude of
      a difference in electronegativities between the material and
      hydrogen of between approximately 0.08 to approximately 0.36, and
      an apparatus for generating a chemical reaction between the
      hydrogen containing molecule and electro-activated material to
      produce hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The system can further comprise a fuel provided in the
      vessel with the hydrogen containing molecule and electro-activated
      material, wherein the apparatus generates a chemical reaction
      between the hydrogen containing molecule, electro-activated
      material and fuel to produce hydrogen. The fuel can be one of pure
      aluminum, aluminum powder, aluminum granules or aluminum shavings.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The system can further comprise one or more mechanisms to
      control the chemical reaction between the hydrogen containing
      molecule, electro-activated material and fuel to produce hydrogen
      on demand, wherein the one or more mechanisms heat the combination
      of the hydrogen containing molecule, electro-activated material
      and fuel to increase the production of hydrogen, and cool the
      combination of the hydrogen containing molecule, electro-activated
      material and fuel to decrease the production of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The hydrogen containing molecule can comprise water, tap
      water, dirty water, high-calcium water, salt water, sea water,
      alkaline water or acidic water. The material can have a catalyst
      hydride dissociation energy between approximately 0 to
      approximately 100 kcal/mol. The material can have a difference in
      electronegativities between atoms in a polar oxide molecule on a
      surface of the material between approximately 0.3 to approximately
      1.4. Electrolysis can be provided in the vessel. The material can
      be catalyzed aluminum, carbon or lead.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems
      according to the present disclosure allow for hydrogen generation
      from a liquid composition such as water. Further, the by-products
      can be a pollution-free source of material for recycling.<br>
      <br>

      [0025] Throughout the figures, the same reference numerals and
      characters, unless otherwise stated, are used to denote like
      features, elements, components or portions of the illustrated
      embodiments. Moreover, while the present disclosure will now be
      described in detail with reference to the figures, it is done so
      in connection with the illustrative embodiments. It is intended
      that changes and modifications can be made to the described
      embodiments without departing from the true scope and spirit of
      the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF DISCLOSURE</b><br>
      <br>
      [0026] Exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems according
      to the present disclosure will now be described, including
      reference to the figures.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Electro-Activation Process</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0027] In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a
      method and system for preparing a hydrogen producing catalyst is
      described. FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram of an activation cell 100
      used to prepare a catalyst from a material, such as carbon or
      lead, that can be used to produce hydrogen. The material can be
      any type of material contemplated by the present disclosure and is
      not limited to any particular type or form.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The activation cell 100 can have an anode 102 and a cathode
      104. In an exemplary embodiment, the anode 102 can be placed
      inside the activation cell 100 along a first side 100a of the
      activation cell 100, and the cathode 104 can be placed inside the
      activation cell 100 along a second side 100b of the activation
      cell 100. The anode 102 can be a metal anode and the cathode 104
      can be a metal cathode, and any type of metal can be used for the
      anode 102 and cathode 104, such as stainless steel, iron,
      galvanized iron, carbon and/or other metals, and the present
      disclosure is not limited to any type of metal. The metal can be
      electrically conductive and resistant to corrosion.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A liquid composition can be provided in the activation cell
      100, such as water 108 or other liquid containing hydrogen, or
      other suitable composition containing hydrogen, and is not limited
      to any particular composition. The water 108 can be tap water,
      filtered water, salt water, sea water and/or other types of water.
      A material 106 can be provided in the water 108 in the activation
      cell 100 so that it can be electro-activated and converted to a
      catalyst. The activation cell 100 can be open on a top surface to
      allow ventilation and the placement of the water 108 and material
      106. The water 108 can be in sufficient quantity to, e.g., cover
      the material being electro-activated. The activation cell 100 can
      be placed in a well-ventilated area such that any gas that is
      produced from the liquid during the electro-activation process can
      be ventilated.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] An electrolyte can be placed into the activation cell 100
      with the water 108 and material 106, which can make the mixture of
      the water 108 and material 106 more electrically conductive.
      Examples of electrolytes that can be used include, but are not
      limited to, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride or potassium
      hydroxide. The electro-activation can also be carried out with no
      added electrolyte, and a higher voltage may be used as the water
      can be less electrically conductive when an electrolyte is not
      added to the water. Electrical energy can be passed through the
      mixture of the water 108 and material 106 to electro-activate the
      material 106. For example, electrical energy, such as in the form
      of electrical current, can be passed through the mixture of water
      108 and material 106 until a value of approximately 6 Ampere-hours
      is achieved. Also, for example, a range of voltage may be used,
      such as from approximately 4 volts to approximately 200 volts.
      Typically, a voltage in the range of approximately 12 volts to
      approximately 150 volts can be used. The exemplary embodiments of
      the present disclosure are not limited to any Ampere-hours or
      voltage, and adjustments may be made based on various factors,
      such as but not limited to the amount of water, the amount of
      material (e.g., carbon), the size of the activation cell, and/or
      other factors including the current density (e.g., Amperes per
      square centimeter) which can be a function of the geometry of the
      cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The catalytic activation cell 100 can be designed to run at
      a low current, e.g., less than approximately 5 amps, and can run
      continuously with no overheating due to power dissipation in the
      catalytic activation cell 100. This can provide for
      electro-activation of the material (e.g., carbon), and thereby
      convert the material into an electro-activated material. For
      example, carbon can be converted into electro-activated carbon,
      which can be referred to as catalytic carbon, or lead can be
      converted into electro-activated lead, which can be referred to as
      catalytic lead. Electro-activated and catalytic are used
      interchangeably in the present disclosure to describe the
      particular catalyst. Electro-activating the material at a low
      current can provide an advantage that the electro-activation may
      not need to be monitored to intervene in the event of, e.g.,
      excessive current, excessive temperature or excessive gas emission
      from the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In other exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      the catalytic activation cell 100 can be designed to run at higher
      energy levels, such as 6 Ampere hours, which can be achieved by,
      e.g., providing electric current for 6 hours at a current of 1
      Ampere, or for 3 hours at a current of 2 Amperes. In various
      embodiments of the present disclosure, different times and
      currents can be used to achieve 6 Ampere hours. The present
      disclosure is not limited to any particular Ampere-hours, and
      other Ampere-hour treatments would also produce catalytic
      transformation of the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The catalyst (electro-activated material 106) can then be
      removed from the activation cell 100, and may be dried if desired.
      Once dried, the catalyst may be easier to store and/or ship. The
      catalyst may be dried by, e.g., air drying, heating in air, and/or
      other types of heating/drying mechanisms and/or methods. Different
      drying methods/processes may be used, and temperatures from
      standard room temperature to up to 200 degrees Fahrenheit can be
      used, and are not limited to such.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exemplary Catalytic Reactions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the
      chemical reaction:<br>
      <br>
      2Al+6[H2O]+C=&gt;C+2[Al(OH)3]+3H2&nbsp;&nbsp; Equation (1)<br>
      <br>
      can be used, where Al is aluminum, H is hydrogen, O is oxygen and
      C is the catalyst (i.e., electro-activated material formed by the
      process described above. In this exemplary catalytic reaction, the
      aluminum and water (H2O) can be used as fuels with the catalyst,
      and hydrogen (H2) can be produced where the by-product is aluminum
      hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In this exemplary reaction, water and
      aluminum are fuels that can be consumed, and the catalyst may not
      be consumed. Other compositions having water, or having hydrogen,
      can also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The same reaction can be written as:<br>
      <br>
      2Al+3[H2O]+C=&gt;C+Al2O3+3H2&nbsp;&nbsp; Equation (2)<br>
      <br>
      where Al is aluminum, H is hydrogen, O is oxygen and C is the
      catalyst formed by the process described above. In this exemplary
      chemical reaction, the aluminum and water (H2O) can be used as
      fuels with the catalyst, and hydrogen (H2) can be produced where
      the by-product is aluminum oxide (Al2O3). Aluminum hydroxide can
      reduce to aluminum oxide when dried, to remove water from the
      aluminum hydroxide. Because the hydrogen-producing reaction can be
      carried out in water, Equation 1 showing an aluminum hydroxide
      product is the reaction mostly used, while Equation 2 showing an
      aluminum oxide product can also be used when describing the
      chemistry. In this exemplary reaction, water and aluminum are
      fuels that can be consumed, and the catalyst may not be consumed.
      The catalyst can be increased if the cell operates with
      electrolysis as the carbon can tend to break into smaller-size
      granules, providing more surface area. The newly-exposed surface
      area can then be electro-activated using the effects of
      electrolysis to promote the growth of a polar oxide on the carbon
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Aluminum and Other Fuels</b><br>
      <br>
      [0036] Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can provide
      for aluminum as the fuel as each atom of aluminum can tie up three
      OH groups to become aluminum hydroxide, Al[OH]3, aluminum can be
      inexpensive and safe, and aluminum can have a higher chemical
      binding energy than the OH groups. Aluminum can be provided to
      help in this reaction as OH groups can be bound to the aluminum
      (Al) so that the accumulation of free (un-bound) OH groups can be
      largely prevented, such as in the liquid composition having the
      catalyst and aluminum, and the recombination with hydrogen atoms
      to form H2O can be prevented.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Aluminum, an element that can be used as a fuel in the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure for producing
      hydrogen, can react with acids and bases. Like other active
      metals, aluminum can dissolve in strong acids to evolve hydrogen
      gas. The catalyst described in the present disclosure can be used
      in pH-neutral liquid based on its strong catalytic efficiency
      (i.e., high reaction rate). This can mean that the water can be
      neither a strong acid nor a strong alkaline liquid, which can
      provide a very safe and environmentally-friendly mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      aluminum shavings can be used in the chemical reactions described
      herein instead of aluminum powder. The use of an electro-activated
      material with aluminum shavings and other non-powder forms of
      aluminum have been shown to successfully produce hydrogen in a
      laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] For a given mass of aluminum in the reaction, the hydrogen
      production rate can be approximately proportional to the surface
      area of the aluminum metal. The aluminum used in some of the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can be powdered
      aluminum. The higher surface-to-volume ratio of powdered aluminum
      can make it suitable for a higher rate of hydrogen production for
      a given amount of aluminum. More coarse fuel, which can be in the
      form of aluminum pellets, aluminum shavings, aluminum granules or
      aluminum sheets, can also be used. Such coarse fuel can provide
      for hydrogen production which can be at a lower rate (for a given
      amount of aluminum) than provided by powdered aluminum in some of
      the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Use of pure
      aluminum may not be required, which can make possible the use of
      lower cost, lower purity aluminum in the hydrogen production
      according to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The size of the aluminum used can be a design variable for
      a particular application. For example, the particle size of the
      aluminum can be chosen to achieve a desired hydrogen production
      rate for a design that has a defined geometry and operating
      temperature. In general, for a given amount of aluminum, as the
      particle size of the aluminum decreases, the reaction rate of the
      chemical reaction described in the present disclosure goes up at
      any given temperature. Also, the reaction rate increases as the
      temperature increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, it
      was found that hydrogen is generated in the reaction described
      above without the use of aluminum (i.e., just using an
      electro-activated material and water), but that adding certain
      fuels, such as aluminum, increased the production of hydrogen. It
      was also found that other fuels besides aluminum can be used. It
      was also found that during the catalytic reaction to generate
      hydrogen, when aluminum powder is being used, hydrogen generation
      can increase when the aluminum powder is mixed or stirred during
      the reaction. A mechanical action can be provided to remove
      aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide, and expose bare aluminum.
      The chemical reactions described in Equations 1 and 2 produce
      hydrogen at higher rates when bare aluminum is used, and produce
      less hydrogen when using aluminum with an oxidized surface. In
      some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, by using a
      blender or other device to chop/burnish aluminum shavings and
      pellets, hydrogen production rates increased by factors of
      approximately two to ten, depending on the intensity of the
      mechanical or electro-mechanical action (i.e., chopping,
      burnishing and/or mixing of the aluminum). The factors can be
      dependent on the burnishing time and the time delay between
      burnishing and hydrogen production. This time delay can result in
      the formation of a film when the bare aluminum surface is exposed
      to air or water, particularly at temperatures above room
      temperature. Burnishing of the aluminum can remove the aluminum
      oxide from the surface of the aluminum, providing a fresh aluminum
      surface for the hydrogen-producing chemical reactions described in
      Equations 1 and 2 in the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Aluminum can be a more efficient fuel in the chemical
      reaction with water and a catalyst when burnished (i.e., using
      mechanical scrubbing to remove aluminum oxide and/or aluminum
      hydroxide films covering the surface). If a mechanical action of
      burnishing or stirring or any other method (e.g., electrolysis) is
      used to remove the aluminum oxide and/or aluminum hydroxide on the
      surface of the aluminum, then stopping that process or reducing
      that process in the hydrogen cell can cause aluminum oxide to form
      on the surface of the aluminum, which can reduce the hydrogen
      production. Also, removing the aluminum from the hydrogen cell or
      from the reaction can also stop the hydrogen production in the
      hydrogen cell. These control parameters can each be used alone or
      in combination with one another to slow or stop the hydrogen
      production, thereby providing hydrogen on-demand.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] There may be other methods/devices for removing the
      oxide/hydroxide and providing a substantially bare aluminum
      surface for the hydrogen-producing reactions described in the
      present disclosure, and the present disclosure is not limited to
      any such method/device. For example, in addition or as a
      substitute to mechanical burnishing, treatments of the aluminum
      surface may also be thermal, optical or chemical.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In some exemplary embodiments, aluminum shavings can be
      reacted with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which
      can speed the chemical reactions described in the present
      disclosure reaction by a factor of 10 or more. This process can be
      a straightforward chemical reaction in which the sodium hydroxide
      undergoes a chemical change, i.e., the sodium hydroxide is
      transformed and consumed in the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The combination of the aluminum and sodium hydroxide can be
      combined with the catalytic reactions described in the present
      disclosure, i.e., Equations (1) and (2). For example, in some
      exemplary embodiments, hydrogen can be generated according to the
      following chemical reaction:<br>
      <br>
      2Al+2[NaOH]+6[H2O]+C=&gt;C+2[NaAl(OH)4]+3H2&nbsp;&nbsp; Equation
      (3)<br>
      <br>
      where the Al is aluminum, H is hydrogen, O is oxygen, NaAl(OH)4 is
      sodium tetrahydroxyaluminate, and C is the catalyst
      (electro-activated material). In this exemplary reaction, water,
      aluminum and sodium hydroxide can be fuels that can be consumed,
      and C can be a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In some of these exemplary embodiments, the reaction can
      begin slowly which can be due to the layer of aluminum oxide on
      the surface of the aluminum. In these exemplary embodiments, once
      the layer of aluminum oxide is pierced during the reaction, the
      reaction can then speed up. In some exemplary embodiments, the
      reaction sped up after 1 to 3 minutes, at temperatures ranging
      from standard room temperature up to 180 degrees Fahrenheit. The
      speed of the reaction can depend on various factors, such as
      temperature, and the amount of aluminum, water and/or sodium
      tetrahydroxyaluminate. Other solutions and/or elements may be used
      to speed up the catalytic reaction, such as salt (NaCl) and/or
      other electrolytes.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can
      produce by-products that are fully recoverable using existing
      commercial methods for producing aluminum metal. The by-products
      from the hydrogen production methods and systems according to the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can be desirable
      because they are pure, and can contain no contaminants including
      bauxite, gibbsite, boehmite, goethite, hematite, kaolinite, and
      TiO2. The large volume of by-products of the exemplary embodiments
      of the present disclosure can be Al(OH)3 and Al2O3, which can be
      recycled to produce more aluminum metal. Recycling of aluminum
      hydroxide and aluminum oxide makes the exemplary embodiments of
      the present disclosure economically viable for large volume
      hydrogen production. Al(OH)3 and Al2O3 can also be used
      commercially without any recycling expense, as Al(OH)3 can been
      used as pharmaceutical ingredients, and Al2O3 is a commonly used
      abrasive material, as well as a commonly used ceramic material.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Aluminum refining from aluminum-bearing bauxite ore can use
      the Bayer process chemistry which can form a hydrate which can be
      essentially the same as the reaction product in the aluminum-water
      reactions described above according to the exemplary embodiments
      of the present disclosure. The hydrate can be calcined to remove
      the water to form alumina. The alumina can then be
      electrolytically reduced into metallic aluminum at about 900
      degrees Celsius using the Hall-Heroult Process, producing aluminum
      metal with 99.7% purity.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In some exemplary embodiments, a catalyzed aluminum was
      used which was found to generate hydrogen at rates that were 30%
      higher than using regular aluminum. The catalyzed aluminum can be
      a combination of aluminum and a material catalyst (e.g., carbon or
      lead or other material which can be a catalyst once
      electro-activated).<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In some exemplary embodiments, the catalyzed aluminum can
      be made of scrap materials, such as aluminum and a material such
      as paper. These two materials can be oxidized at a high
      temperature which can reduce the paper to carbon. In a first step,
      the scrap paper and scrap aluminum can be converted into
      carbonized aluminum. This can be carried out at, e.g.,
      temperatures high enough to carbonize the paper but lower than the
      melting temperature of aluminum. The materials often used for this
      process can be integrated, much like the aluminum foil on paper
      that is sometimes used for wrapping products such as chewing gum.
      Because the paper and aluminum are scrap materials, this can be a
      very low-cost starting material when used in high volume
      manufacturing.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The aluminum-material (i.e., aluminum-carbon) mixture can
      then be chemically activated to transform the material into a
      catalyst, such as carbon into catalytic or electro-activated
      carbon. For example, the aluminum-material mixture can be placed
      into a vessel and electro-activated. The aluminum itself is not a
      catalyst, but it is “catalyzed” by the presence of the catalyst,
      such as the electro-activated carbon. The catalyzed aluminum can
      be mostly aluminum, and can have a carbon (or other material)
      content of less than 2%, and is not limited to this or any
      particular range. The carbon can be in direct physical contact
      with the aluminum, making the hydrogen production process very
      efficient.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The catalyzed aluminum granule size can be approximately 30
      microns to approximately 0.2 mm, making it safe to handle in dry
      air. The aluminum granule size is not limited to any particular
      size. When the catalyzed aluminum is used to split water or other
      hydrogen containing material, hydrogen can be released in the form
      of a gas, and the oxygen can remain in the water in the form of
      aluminum hydroxide. The low cost of producing hydrogen using
      catalyzed aluminum can result in the aluminum hydroxide simply
      being discarded, or it can be recycled, or aluminum oxide can be
      used for other industrial purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] There can be several advantages of using catalyzed
      aluminum. The use of catalyzed aluminum can be more simple than
      using aluminum and an electro-activated material (i.e., catalyst).
      For example, using catalyzed aluminum can provide for just the
      addition of water in order to produce hydrogen. Further, the
      catalyzed aluminum granule size can be optimum for hydrogen
      production. A larger granule size (i.e., lower surface-to-volume)
      would result in a slower production of hydrogen per pound of fuel,
      possibly requiring more fuel and a larger vessel to produce
      hydrogen at a given rate. A smaller granule size (higher
      surface-to-volume) can result in the fuel being consumed more
      quickly to produce hydrogen at a given rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Further, catalyzed aluminum can be safe to handle, ship and
      store based on the granule size. If aluminum powder is used to
      make hydrogen, the aluminum powder may possibly become chemically
      unstable, and possibly explosive, if the powder has a particle
      size less than 30 microns. Catalyzed aluminum can have an average
      granule size of approximately 30 microns to approximately 200
      microns. The ratios of aluminum and the catalyst can be optimized
      in the formulation and manufacturing of catalyzed aluminum. The
      ratio of aluminum to carbon can be higher when catalyzed aluminum
      is used (e.g., instead of the catalyst and aluminum). Catalyzed
      aluminum can be almost all fuel, such as more than 98% aluminum
      and less than 2% catalyst (e.g., carbon). Further, the mixture of
      catalyzed aluminum and water is not critical. Each aluminum
      granule can have a local source of catalyst integrated into the
      granule.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Some chemicals may be even more helpful than aluminum such
      as barium oxide (BaO), which can tie up as many as four or five OH
      groups. Some experiments have shown that barium oxide can be a
      very good fuel with regard to hydrogen production, although there
      can be some safety issues and can generally be more expensive than
      aluminum. Other elements, chemicals or fuels having the same
      effect as aluminum can also be used. For example, chemicals that
      tie up one OH group can be helpful, such as but not limited to Li
      (can form lithium hydroxide), Na (can form sodium hydroxide), K
      (can form potassium hydroxide), Rb (can form rubidium hydroxide),
      Cs (can form cesium hydroxide) and Si (can form silicon
      hydroxide). Other chemicals can be more helpful, which can tie up
      two OH groups, such as but not limited to Ca (can form calcium
      hydroxide), Sr (can form strontium hydroxide) and Ba (can form
      barium hydroxide).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Additives</b><br>
      <br>
      [0056] A chemical additive can be used with the catalysts in the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, an
      electrolyte can be added for the purpose of increasing the
      electrical conductivity of the liquid in a hydrogen producing
      cell. This can be needed to make a cell suitable for, e.g.,
      electrolysis, which requires the flow of electrical current
      through the liquid in the hydrogen cell. The use of an electrolyte
      additive may be needed for a cell containing water. Similarly, the
      use of an electrolyte additive may be needed for a cell containing
      any hydrogen-containing substance. Common additives that can be
      used for this purpose include sodium chloride (salt, or NaCl),
      sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), and/or
      potassium hydroxide (KOH). Additives can also be used for the
      addition of “defoaming agents” to help suppress frothing when the
      hydrogen is delivered at high rates from a hydrogen cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Additives can also be used for the purpose of causing a
      catalytic sequence, as described in Steps 1-3 in FIGS. 3(a)-3(c).
      For example, step 1 (where hydrogen is robbed from any
      hydrogen-containing molecule (“H-molecule”) to create a C—H
      molecule) can operate with any desired chemical additive as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
(H-molecule)+catalyst+additive?catalyst+C—H+(H-molecule*)+additive*<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In the above reaction, the H-molecule can be any
      hydrogen-containing molecule, and the H-molecule* is what is left
      of the original H-molecule after a hydrogen atom is robbed from
      the original H-molecule. In the above reaction, the additive
      molecule is any molecule which is added to achieve a desired
      effect. The additive* molecule is what is left of the original
      additive molecule after the effect of chemical reaction(s),
      mixing, or electrolysis to dissociate or otherwise modify the
      original additive molecule.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Catalysts</b><br>
      <br>
      [0059] Various catalysts have been found to be able to produce
      hydrogen from water once electro-activated, as will be shown
      below. Certain factors may enable some elements to be better
      catalysts for producing hydrogen from hydrogen containing
      molecules, such as water, than other elements. Some of these
      factors include an absolute magnitude of the difference in
      electronegativities between a catalyst and hydrogen, a catalyst
      hydride dissociation energy and/or a difference in
      electronegativities between the atoms in a polar oxide molecule on
      a surface of a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Electronegativity can be a measure of the relative tendency
      of an atom to attract electrons to it when chemically combined
      with another atom. Electronegativity, as it is usually calculated,
      may not be strictly a property of an atom, but can be a property
      of an atom in a molecule. The electronegativity of an element can
      vary with its chemical environment. The most commonly used range
      of electronegative uses a system of numbers proposed by Linus
      Pauling. This gives a dimensionless quantity, commonly referred to
      as the Pauling scale, on a relative scale running from around 0.7
      to 3.98 (e.g., hydrogen electronegativity is 2.20).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The reason electronegativity can be important for purposes
      of the present disclosure can be that electronegativity can
      influence the formation of catalyst groups (e.g., C—H groups) to
      take a hydrogen atom from water. The frequent formation of C—H
      groups, and the subsequent dissociation of those C—H groups are
      known characteristics which can be central features of the
      exemplary embodiments of the catalyst systems of the present
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In the field of chemistry, C—H (the hyphen implies a
      chemical bond between the carbon and hydrogen) is known as a
      hydride. The C—H bond is a bond between carbon and hydrogen atoms,
      most commonly found in organic compounds. C—H molecules seldom
      exist alone, as stable molecules. For these reasons, C—H is
      sometimes referred to as a molecule and sometimes referred to as a
      chemical group. Molecules are usually thought of as having good
      chemical stability (C—H does not), and having a relatively high
      dissociation energy (C—H does not).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The reason for the importance of the C—H group is because
      it is the first step in a sequence that describes the chemical
      separation of hydrogen from water, as shown below:<br>
      <br>
      H2O+C=&gt;C—H+O—H&nbsp;&nbsp; Equation (4)<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The reason electronegative difference can be important is
      that covalent bonds are very strong, and have more strength if the
      electronegativity difference is small. Using Pauling's
      electronegativity scale, carbon has an electronegativity of 2.5
      and hydrogen has an electronegativity of 2.1, so that the
      electronegativity difference between these two atoms is 0.4.
      Therefore, C—H molecules should form readily and because of the
      strong covalent bonds the C—H molecules should be chemically
      stable, although they are not. The carbon and hydrogen atoms will
      not remain together, and they cannot keep other atoms away. The
      favorable and frequent formation of C—H groups, and the subsequent
      dissociation of those C—H groups are characteristics which can be
      important aspects of these groups for the catalysts systems
      described in the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the
      absolute magnitude of the difference in electronegativities
      between the catalyst and hydrogen can be an important feature in
      determining which catalysts are likely to be good catalysts for
      electro-activation and use in generating hydrogen. The absolute
      magnitude accounts for both a primary range (positive) and a
      mirror range (negative). In the exemplary embodiments of the
      present disclosure, a preferred range on the Pauling scale can be
      approximately 0.08 to 0.36. Such a range can lead to
      identification of elements most likely to function as catalysts
      useful in extracting hydrogen from water or other
      hydrogen-containing materials.<br>

      [0066] The table shown in FIG. 2 identifies elements most likely
      to function as catalysts. Having an absolute magnitude of an
      electronegativity difference lower than the preferred range can
      result in the formation of a strong covalent bond for the Step 1
      product (as shown in FIG. 3(a)), thereby stopping the sequence
      because that product would not easily dissociate. Having an
      absolute magnitude of an electronegativity difference higher than
      the preferred range can result in a bond that is too weak
      (polar-like) and may not be strong enough for Step 1, during which
      the catalytic element must steal a hydrogen atom from a water
      molecule. For example, lead (Pb) and tungsten (W) may be catalysts
      as the electronegativity difference is 0.13 and 0.16,
      respectively, as shown in the table of FIG. 2. Lead (Pb) may be a
      better catalyst than tungsten (W) because of other factors,
      including the formation of a polar oxide (with the right
      characteristics) on the metal surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Another important characteristic in determining which
      element or molecule can be a catalyst useful in extracting
      hydrogen from water or other hydrogen-containing materials can be
      the dissociation energy. Dissociation energy, in the field of
      physical chemistry, is the energy required for complete separation
      of the molecule into two or more parts. Dissociation energy can be
      important for complete separation of the atoms in the, e.g., C—H
      group. An array of atoms held together by covalent bonds forms a
      true molecule. The C—H hydride can be considered a “group” because
      it is a molecule with special characteristics. The C—H group is a
      hydride, there is only a small difference in electronegativity so
      the two atoms share the electrons. The result is a covalent bond
      (which can be depicted as C:H or C—H), and the atoms are held
      together by their mutual affinity for their shared electrons.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Separation of the atoms in the C—H group can liberate the
      hydrogen. Separation of the atoms in the C—H group is Step 2 in a
      sequence that describes the chemical separation of hydrogen from
      water, as shown in FIG. 3(a) and FIG. 3(b). FIG. 3(a) shows the
      chemical separation of hydrogen from water by chemical equations
      and FIG. 3(b) shows the chemical separation of hydrogen from water
      in the form of a physical model. In FIG. 3(a), “CC” means
      catalytic carbon or electro-activated carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In FIG. 3(c), “C” means catalytic carbon or
      electro-activated carbon. As shown in FIG. 3(c), C—H can have a
      weak bond and can be likely to dissociate. In Step 1, because of
      similar electronegativities, carbon can form a stronger bond with
      hydrogen than can oxygen. Carbon competes with oxygen and steals
      hydrogen from the water molecule (formation of a transient C—H
      group), leaving behind a stable OH group. The formation of the C—H
      group is very favorable, but the instability of the C—H group
      causes it to exist as a group for only a short time. In Step 2,
      the C—H group dissociates. The hydrogen atom combines with another
      hydrogen atom (equal electronegativities, leading to a strong
      covalent bond). The resulting hydrogen molecule (a gas) escapes
      from the liquid. After C—H dissociation, the free carbon atom
      repeats the cycle (Step 1). In Step 3, aluminum can be more
      reactive than carbon, and an aluminum atom can acquire the O—H
      group. Similarly, it can acquire two additional O—H groups to form
      aluminum hydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The comparison of dissociation energies in FIG. 3(c) shows
      that a good catalyst can form a hydride with a low dissociation
      energy, to aid in the complete separation of the atoms in the C—H
      group. A range for the catalyst hydride dissociation energy can be
      from approximately zero to approximately 100 kcal/mol. A catalyst
      hydride dissociation energy higher than this range may not be
      suitable because the high dissociation energy of the Step 1
      product may not be favorable to Step 2 in which the Step 1 product
      must easily dissociate. The separation of the C—H group can
      require less energy than the separation of atoms from any other
      molecule in the chemical sequence described in FIGS. 3(a) and
      3(b). Separation of the atoms in the C—H group liberates the
      hydrogen. For example, lead can be a possible catalyst because
      Pb—H has a lower dissociation energy than C—H, and Tungsten (W)
      can also be a possible catalyst because W—H has a lower
      dissociation energy than C—H.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Another important characteristic in determining which
      element or molecule can be a catalyst useful in extracting
      hydrogen from water or other hydrogen-containing materials can be
      the difference in electronegativities between the atoms in a polar
      oxide molecule on a surface of the catalyst. A polar oxide can be
      an oxide composed of molecules that are polarized molecules. A
      polar molecule can be a molecule in which the centroid of the
      positive charges can be different from the centroid of the
      negative charges. A polar molecule can also be referred to as a
      dipole.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Electronegativity can be a measure of the tendency of an
      atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. The Pauling scale is
      the most commonly used measure of electronegativity. Fluorine (the
      most electronegative element) is assigned a value of 4.0, and
      values range down to Caesium and Francium which are the least
      electronegative at 0.7 on the Pauling scale. The reason
      electronegativity can be important is that only a certain range of
      electronegativity values can lead to the formation of the polar
      oxide desired for a good catalyst. A preferred electronegativity
      range can be as shown in the table of FIG. 3(d), which can be
      approximately 0.3 to approximately 1.4 (on the Pauling scale) for
      the difference in electronegativities between the atoms in a polar
      oxide molecule on the surface of a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Elements that form a weakly-bonded polar surface may well
      be suited for use as hydrogen-producing catalysts. Lead (Pb) forms
      complex oxides, and therefore, might be likely to have one or more
      surface oxides that are weakly-bonded polar surface oxides.
      Tungsten (W) forms a smaller number of oxides and therefore might
      not be likely to have one or more surface oxides that are weakly
      bonded polar surface oxides. Therefore, although tungsten may have
      a suitable absolute magnitude electronegativity difference and
      dissociation energy as described above, it may not be a suitable
      catalyst as lead and carbon may be.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Electro-Activation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0074] Electro-activation aids in the chemical processes described
      above. As shown in Step 1 in FIGS. 3(a)-3(c), carbon (or other
      catalyst) must steal a hydrogen atom from water, which normally
      holds two hydrogen atoms with oxygen-to-hydrogen bonds. Normal
      carbon (or other catalyst) may do this with a low reaction rate,
      but to increase this reaction rate to make carbon a more effective
      catalyst, the carbon atoms can be electrically polarized on the
      surface of carbon particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A difficulty in electrically polarizing carbon atoms on the
      surface of carbon particles can be that carbon is an electrical
      conductor, and a conductor will not remain polarized after the
      electrical field is removed. However, it is possible to polarize
      the oxide on the surface of the carbon particles. An oxide
      dielectric can be polarized and will remain polarized after the
      electrical field is removed. Solid carbon can be electrochemically
      oxidized and the final distribution of the products can be
      dominated by the equilibrium of the Boudouard reaction
      (C+CO2?2CO).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Carbon forms two oxides at the surface, carbon dioxide and
      carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide has a dipole moment, and carbon
      dioxide is different. This bond is naturally polarized as
      illustrated below:<br>
      <br>
      ***<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Oxygen attracts electrons more effectively than carbon.
      Therefore, the carbon-oxygen bond is polarized. A partial negative
      charge is centered on each oxygen atom (because of the small
      excess of electron density) and a partial positive charge is
      centered on the carbon atom (because of the slight deficiency of
      electron density). Because the molecule is linear and the two bond
      dipoles are equal in magnitude and oppositely directed, the whole
      molecule is still not polar (the whole molecule has a zero dipole
      moment).<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Molecules with mirror symmetry like oxygen and carbon
      dioxide have no permanent dipole moments. Even if there is no
      permanent dipole moment, it is possible to induce a dipole moment
      by the application of an external electric field. This is called
      polarization and the magnitude of the dipole moment induced is a
      measure of the polarizability of the molecular species.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] This kind of polarization can be induced by the application
      of an electric current through the material (electro-activation).
      The CO molecule has a small negative charge on carbon and a small
      negative charge on oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Carbon and oxygen together have a total of 10 valence
      electrons. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen
      atom and only two from carbon, one of the bonding orbitals is
      occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or dipolar
      bond. This causes a polarization. Polarity can refer to a
      separation of electric charge leading to a molecule or its
      chemical groups having an electric dipole or a multipole moment.
      Polar molecules interact through dipole-dipole intermolecular
      forces and hydrogen bonds. The CO molecule has a small negative
      charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Normal carbon, before electro-activation, may have a native
      oxide film, which may have the oxide molecules partially
      non-aligned. During electro-activation, the carbon surface will be
      more densely oxidized. After electro-activation, the carbon
      surface will tend to have the oxide molecules aligned, leaving any
      non-oxidized (bare) regions on the carbon surface with an induced
      negative surface charge. Both CO and CO2 form as a gas, and some
      of these molecules will escape into the water, leaving behind
      microscopically-small bare (non-oxidized) regions of the carbon
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The carbon surface has a negative induced charge, similar
      to the mirror charge that is produced on the plate of a
      parallel-plate capacitor. The other pseudo plate that mirrors the
      charge is the positive oxygen ends of the CO molecules. The
      electrical potential is the same on all carbon surfaces, because
      carbon is a conductor.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] As a portion of a water molecule, a hydrogen atom (which is
      partially electron depleted, and has a positive single-proton
      nucleus) will be attracted to the negative surface of the carbon.
      This attraction between the hydrogen and the carbon aids in the
      action of the carbon to steal a hydrogen from the water molecule,
      thereby creating a C—H molecule as part of Step-1 of the catalytic
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Accordingly, any element or molecule that can form a polar
      oxide surface layer in water can be a candidate for
      electro-activation to convert it into a hydrogen-producing
      catalyst in water. Accordingly, any element or molecule that can
      be used in the electro-activation process to convert it into a
      hydrogen-producing catalyst, the element (and/or molecule) or its
      oxides can be water compatible. This can mean preferably soluble
      in water, or existent in water in the form of a colloid
      suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Further, compound molecules (combinations of elements) may
      also be good catalysts if they provide the same requirements as
      described for elements in the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] According to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure, many different forms of materials can be
      electro-activated as described above to produce a catalyst. For
      example, in various experiments performed according to the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, it has been shown
      that hydrogen can be produced using a catalyst material in various
      forms, such as solid, liquid or other forms of the particular
      element, such as carbon or lead.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Further, a fuel may not be required in order to generate
      hydrogen. Experiments have shown that the catalyst alone with a
      hydrogen containing composition, such as water or composition
      containing water, can produce hydrogen with a catalyst C,
      according to the reaction:<br>
      <br>
      H2O+C=&gt;C+H+OH&nbsp;&nbsp; Equation (5)<br>
      <br>
      [0088] A fuel can, however, increase the rate of production of
      hydrogen in the chemical reactions shown in Equations (1) and (2).
      When hydrogen atoms are generated, they can tend to combine, as in
      H+H=&gt;H2 (a gas), which is referred to as the Toffel reaction. A
      competing reaction can also occur, such as H+OH=&gt;H2O, a
      “recombination” reaction that can prevent the hydrogen from being
      liberated in the form of H2 gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can use
      a hydrogen containing material (e.g., water) and aluminum (or
      similar material) as fuel for the exemplary chemical reactions
      described herein. The potential use of water from various sources
      and lower cost, lower purity aluminum can provide for alternative
      low-cost sources that can be used to provide fuels for the
      catalytic reactions according to the exemplary embodiments of the
      methods and systems of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] According to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure, water can be used from various different sources. The
      use of pure water may not be required. Therefore, it may not be
      necessary to use distilled water or de-ionized water for the
      production of hydrogen, which can be more expensive than, e.g.,
      tap water or sea water. In exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure, various water sources were used in the exemplary
      chemical reactions, including tap water, dirty water, high-calcium
      water, salt water, sea water, alkaline water, and acidic water. In
      these experiments, it was found that all these various water
      samples worked well in the chemical reactions of the exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure for hydrogen production. In
      some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, it was found
      that some forms of water, including salt water and alkaline water,
      can provide a slightly higher rate of hydrogen production than
      more pure forms of water, such as deionized water or distilled
      water. This can be because salt water and alkaline water can have
      additives that can tend to ionize the water, which can make it
      more chemically active and/or more mobile in an aqueous solution.
      This can be because electrostatic fields, created by the polar
      oxides, form forces that move the chemicals in the liquid. An
      electrolysis environment can also form forces that move the
      chemicals in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The use of water from various sources can provide, e.g.,
      more design latitude and freedom to a user in selection of
      construction materials for a hydrogen cell, water and water
      ingredients to minimize corrosion of the materials used in the
      construction of a hydrogen cell and associated parts according to
      the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Such use of
      water from various sources can provide for significant cost
      reduction by, e.g., making it possible to use a wider range of
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The use of salt water and/or sea water for hydrogen
      production according to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure can make it suitable for marine applications, as well
      as providing an energy source for coastal areas. The exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure can provide hydrogen
      production in all parts of the world and near any seashore,
      including remote islands. Accordingly, many island nations can use
      the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure to, e.g.,
      decrease fuel costs and reduce or eliminate the need for
      tanker-ship import of fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Further, the catalyst described in the exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure can be used to obtain
      hydrogen without requiring aluminum or water. For example, the
      catalyst can be used to obtain hydrogen by splitting other
      molecules. Hydrogen-robbing from any hydrogen-containing molecule
      can be similar for other molecules than water, e.g, such as for
      step 1 in the chemical reaction sequence as described in FIGS.
      3(a)-3(c). The chemical reactions describe the same
      hydrogen-robbing step, used to obtain a C—H molecule from either a
      water molecule or from a hydrogen-containing molecule. For
      example, when the water molecule H2O is split apart, the O—H
      molecule is simply what is left of the original water molecule
      after a hydrogen atom is robbed from the original water molecule.
      Further, other hydrogen molecules may be used with the catalyst to
      split the hydrogen molecule, such as but not limited to wood,
      diesel or kerosene.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental Data</b><br>
      <br>
      [0094] Experiments were conducted to determine whether the
      electro-activation of a material, e.g., carbon, can increase
      hydrogen production. Electro-activated carbon, electro-activated
      lead and electro-activated tungsten were used in an experiment
      with water and aluminum, and heated to determine hydrogen
      production, and the rates of hydrogen generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The tests described above have shown that the catalysts
      prepared according to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure can be an excellent material for use in splitting water
      to produce hydrogen at high rates of production. Further, the
      tests showed that after the catalyst is electro-activated
      according to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      an enhanced effect as a catalyst can be semi-permanent, lasting up
      to several weeks and even months. Long long-term storage of the
      catalyst in a damp or wet environment can preserve the
      effectiveness of the catalytic properties of the catalyst for
      months and even years.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] The catalytic carbon is reusable (i.e., the catalytic
      effect of the electro-activation is preserved). The catalytic
      carbon can be stored and used months later, having the same effect
      as a fresh catalyst (i.e., catalytic carbon) with water and
      aluminum as fuels. Further, the catalytic carbon can be used
      several times over with water and aluminum being the only consumed
      fuels in the exemplary catalytic reactions described in the
      present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In some exemplary embodiments, it was shown that catalytic
      carbon, in trace amounts, can be left behind in the
      vessel/hydrogen cell even after washing/cleaning of the
      vessel/hydrogen cell. Accordingly, in some experiments where
      electro-activated carbon was not used, but was used previously in
      the same vessel, some hydrogen production was noted when there
      should have been close to none. Accordingly, using the same vessel
      over and over can provide certain advantages when using catalytic
      carbon to produce hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] In some exemplary embodiments, it was found that “wet”
      electro-activated carbon (i.e., electro-activated carbon still wet
      from the water in the electro-activation process) produced
      hydrogen generation rates that were approximately 5-10% higher
      than the hydrogen generation rates produced when the catalytic
      carbon was dried. This can be because the wet catalytic carbon can
      have less surface-modification history. Washing the catalytic
      carbon can involve some minor surface changes at the surface of
      the carbon. Drying the catalytic carbon can also allow for
      possible surface abrasion when the carbon particles are moved,
      shifted or poured. Catalytic carbon is a surface-reacting
      heterogeneous catalyst. In some exemplary embodiments, it has been
      shown that the carbon surface immediately following the
      electro-activation process can be optimum for hydrogen generation,
      and any surface treatment or damage following electro-activation
      (e.g., washing or drying) can result in slightly-reduced catalytic
      effectiveness when the catalytic carbon is used to split water and
      produce hydrogen in accordance with the catalytic reactions
      described in the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Carbon can exhibit good tendencies for electro-activation
      and use as a catalyst in hydrogen production with water. Carbon is
      an element that can have electronegativity similar to hydrogen and
      can form a polar bond with hydrogen. Carbon can form a polar oxide
      surface layer in water, and carbon can be pseudo-soluble in water
      in the form of a colloidal suspension of carbon particles in
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The tests described above provide that catalytic lead
      prepared according to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure can be an excellent material for use in splitting water
      to produce hydrogen at high rates of production. Lead powder was
      electro-activated and oxidized at a current of approximately 1
      ampere, for 9 ampere-hours. The electro-activated lead powder was
      mixed with aluminum powder and water, and heated. At approximately
      148 degrees Fahrenheit, hydrogen generation occurred at a
      sufficient rate. At approximately 162 degrees Fahrenheit, the
      hydrogen generation was significant at almost double the rate as
      at 148 degrees Fahrenheit. This confirms that lead works, as lead
      has an acceptable/desirable electronegativity difference between
      the catalyst and hydrogen, a dissociation energy, and a difference
      in electronegativities between the atoms in a polar oxide molecule
      on the surface of the catalyst in the ranges described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The tests described above provide that the catalytic
      tungsten prepared according to the exemplary embodiments of the
      present disclosure may not be an excellent material for use in
      splitting water to produce hydrogen at high rates of production.
      Tungsten powder was electro-activated and mixed with aluminum
      powder and water, and heated. However, there was no significant
      hydrogen generation. This confirmed that although tungsten had an
      electronegativity difference between the catalyst and hydrogen and
      a dissociation energy in the ranges described above, the
      unsuitable characteristic of the tungsten oxide (as they are not
      polar oxides), makes tungsten undesirable for use as a catalyst in
      the production of hydrogen as described in the exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] FIG. 4 illustrates a system for the production of hydrogen
      according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. A
      hydrogen cell 200 can be provided where a heating subunit 202 can
      be provided having a heating element 208 within. The heating
      element 208 can be of various types, such as an electrical heater,
      a glow plug, a heat-exchanger coil with hot water running through
      it, or an electrolysis unit, but is not limited to such. A power
      supply, such as, e.g., a wire 204, can be provided to power the
      heating subunit 202 and/or heating element 208. If hot water is
      used to provide heat to the heating element 208, 204 can represent
      the input/output of the hot water. In other embodiments, the
      heating element may run independently on a battery and/or may be
      within the hydrogen cell 200. Within the hydrogen cell 200,
      aluminum and water (or other hydrogen containing molecule) can be
      provided as, e.g., fuels, and a catalyst, such as
      electro-activated carbon or lead. The catalyst, water and aluminum
      can be in contact with each other in a mixture in the hydrogen
      cell 200 as needed to, e.g., heat the mixture of the catalyst,
      water and aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, one
      part catalyst can be provided with one part aluminum, which can be
      in the form of aluminum powder, flakes or granules, with
      approximately three parts water, in the hydrogen cell 200. An
      important requirement can be that the carbon concentration must be
      high at the surface of the aluminum. This can be achieved in
      practice by ensuring that “black water” is used in the cell. If
      the water is black, because of a high concentration of catalytic
      carbon, the concentration of catalytic carbon has been shown to be
      high enough to produce hydrogen according to the processes
      described herein. Various ratios of the catalyst, aluminum and
      water can be used, and the present disclosure is not limited to
      any particular ratio.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The mixture of the catalyst, water and aluminum can then be
      heated using the heating element 208 to a temperature of
      approximately 140 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 190 degrees
      Fahrenheit. The present disclosure is not limited to any
      temperature ranges, and various temperatures may be used according
      to different embodiments of the present disclosure. For example,
      different catalysts may operate and peak at different
      temperatures. In some exemplary embodiments, the mixture can be
      heated to approximately 180 degrees Fahrenheit, which can prevent
      excessive loss of water due to vaporization or boiling. Water
      evaporation (and heat loss, or cooling) can be controlled and
      limited by operating the hydrogen cell in a temperature range of
      approximately 160 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 180 degrees
      Fahrenheit that is below the boiling temperature of water (i.e.,
      212 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level). From the equations described
      above, the reaction produces hydrogen and aluminum hydroxide, and
      the hydrogen can be collected at hydrogen output 206. Hydrogen, a
      light gas, collects in the upper regions of the cell 200. The
      hydrogen output 206 can be connected by a tube to the higher
      region of the space in the cell 200. The aluminum hydroxide can be
      collected within the hydrogen cell 200 or outside of the hydrogen
      cell 200, using appropriate structures and elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] FIG. 5 illustrates a system for the production of hydrogen
      according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. The
      system of the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 5 is similar to the
      system in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 4, which can have a
      hydrogen cell 300, a wire 304 providing electrical power to a
      heating element 308 within a heating subunit 302, where a
      catalyst, aluminum and water are provided. The heating element 308
      heats the mixture of the catalyst, aluminum and water to produce
      hydrogen and aluminum hydroxide, and the hydrogen can be collected
      at hydrogen output 306. In addition, the exemplary embodiment of
      FIG. 5 can have a cooling subunit 310. For example, the cooling
      subunit can have within a cooling coil having a cold water input
      312 and a water output 314. The cooling coil can be in contact
      with the mixture of water, aluminum and catalyst. The cooling can
      slow down the reaction process, thereby decreasing the rate and
      volume of hydrogen generation. Such a system can be used to
      produce hydrogen on demand, where appropriate control instruments
      and tools can be used to produce the temperatures needed to
      increase and slow down the rate and volume of hydrogen generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The exemplary system of FIG. 5 can provide hydrogen
      “on-demand.” Heating the hydrogen cell 300 can increase the
      temperature and increase the hydrogen production. Factors (i.e.,
      control parameters) that can be considered when generating
      hydrogen and increasing the hydrogen production can be the amount
      of water, amount of electro-activated catalyst, amount and type of
      aluminum, the manner and rate of oxide/hydroxide removal from the
      aluminum surface, and the temperature. In some embodiments, the
      cell can be charged with a continuing rate of aluminum granules
      and water, so that the fuel elements are provided “on demand” in a
      manner similar to the way that gasoline and air is provided to a
      typical internal combustion engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Cooling the hydrogen cell (e.g., by providing cold water
      into the hydrogen cell) can reduce the temperature, thereby
      reducing the hydrogen production. When providing hydrogen
      on-demand, various factors (i.e., control parameters) can be
      considered in order to decrease the rate of hydrogen production.
      For example, if the amount of water is reduced, such as by
      removing the water from the hydrogen cell, this can slow or stop
      the production of hydrogen. Reducing the amount of catalyst can
      also reduce the amount of hydrogen production, although it can be
      difficult to completely remove all the catalyst, as trace amounts
      may still be in the hydrogen cell. Reducing the temperature in the
      hydrogen cell can also reduce the hydrogen production. For
      example, reducing the temperature of the hydrogen cell by
      approximately 18 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit can reduce the hydrogen
      production rate in the hydrogen cell by a factor of approximately
      2. Reducing the temperature of the hydrogen cell by approximately
      another 18 to approximately 20 degrees Fahrenheit can again reduce
      the hydrogen production in the hydrogen cell by a factor of
      approximately 2, and so on. This can be done by using a cooling
      subunit 310, or other devices/methods to reduce the temperature of
      the hydrogen cell 300.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] The systems described in the present disclosure can be
      combined with existing systems for producing hydrogen in some
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, a
      hybrid system can be provided for producing hydrogen that combines
      the system(s) of the present disclosure with an electrolysis
      system. An electrolysis system can produce significant heat, and
      that heat can be used to start or to keep up the reactions
      described in the present disclosure. For example, the heat from an
      electrolysis system can start or keep up the reaction of Equation
      1, where water, aluminum and electro-activated carbon are heated
      to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen produced from either one or both
      systems can then be used for the particular purpose. This can
      provide a method and system where pH-neutral chemistry can be
      used, which is different from the prior art methods and systems
      used for generating hydrogen using electrolysis. Electrolysis has
      been shown to be effective in removing films from the fuel
      material so that the hydrogen-producing reaction can be sustained
      for longer periods of time as a result of having a
      continuously-cleaned surface of the fuel material.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] There can be several advantages for using a hybrid system.
      A single chamber can provide for electro-activation of the carbon,
      as well as provide for hydrogen generation. Accordingly, the
      carbon can continuously be converted to electro-activated carbon
      and then produce hydrogen. Another advantage can be that more
      hydrogen can be produced per unit energy input than if
      electrolysis alone were used, and the power input required for
      electrolysis can be used to heat the catalytic reactions described
      in Equations 1 and 2 to a desired operating temperature. Further,
      the electrolysis chemistry can aid in oxidizing the aluminum in
      the catalytic reactions described in Equations 1 and 2 to tie up
      OH chemical groups when the water is split into H and OH groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] In some exemplary embodiments, a hybrid system can use
      electrolysis and catalytic carbon in combination to produce
      hydrogen. Often, when using electro-activated carbon with a fuel,
      such as aluminum, aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide can be
      formed in the form of large solids. These solids can be large, and
      can be difficult to remove during operation of the cell as well as
      during maintenance of the cell. If a low current electrolysis is
      used in the liquid composition containing the electro-activated
      carbon and aluminum, then formation of these large solids can be
      prevented, such that only very small grains of aluminum oxide and
      aluminum hydroxide are formed. Another advantage of providing
      electrolysis to the cell can be that the energy deposited in the
      liquid can be a source of heat. Heat can be used for the catalytic
      carbon reaction to produce hydrogen at a higher rate, such that
      the hydrogen production rate can double with every increase in
      temperature of approximately 18 to approximately 20 degrees
      Fahrenheit. Various other combinations of hybrid systems are
      contemplated by the present disclosure and are not limited to the
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Electrolysis can also be used in hydrogen producing cells
      to prevent any buildup of aluminum hydroxide, both on the aluminum
      surface and as solid “clumps” in the cell. Low-level electrolysis
      has been found to prevent the buildup of aluminum hydroxide in
      hydrogen producing cells containing a catalyst, water and
      aluminum. For example, a DC current of approximately 100
      milliamperes or less can be effective in preventing the aluminum
      hydroxide from forming lumps or clumps in electrolysis cells that
      range in construction from two plates to seven plates, and range
      in size (volume) from 5 square centimeters to 1000 square
      centimeters. Further, a DC current of approximately 100
      milliamperes or less can be effective in preventing the aluminum
      hydroxide from coating the aluminum and slowing the production of
      hydrogen. This can prevent the need for mechanical burnishing to
      maintain a clean aluminum surface during the hydrogen-producing
      chemical reaction as described in the exemplary embodiments of the
      present disclosure. Further, electrolysis can be used in hydrogen
      producing cells to clean the surface of any material and prevent
      buildup of any material in the cell, not just aluminum, as
      electrolysis can dissociate any molecule, not just water and
      aluminum hydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Further, the catalyst (such as catalytic carbon or
      catalytic lead) can increase the hydrogen production performance
      of a broad range of types of electrolysis cells. It was found that
      adding the catalyst to electrolysis cells can increase the
      hydrogen-production efficiency, per watt, of the electrolysis
      cell. For example, when electro-activated carbon is added to an
      electrolysis cell, two mechanisms of action are active during the
      production of hydrogen from the cell. First, the electrical
      production of hydrogen from electrolysis, and second, the chemical
      production of hydrogen from the use of the electro-activated
      carbon. The advantages of this can be that the chemical production
      of hydrogen benefits from the co-existant electrical production of
      hydrogen. Further, the electrical production of hydrogen benefits
      from the co-existant chemical production of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] The reasons for the increase of the hydrogen-production
      efficiency of the electrolysis cell can be that the
      electro-activated carbon lowers the activation energy, Ea, of the
      water splitting process, thereby resulting in more hydrogen
      production per watt of power applied to the electrolysis cell. The
      electro-activated carbon hydrogen-producing reaction is
      exothermic. The reaction provides heat which makes it easier to
      compensate from heat lost due to cooling, leading to a system
      designed to operate under thermal-equilibrium conditions, if
      desired. If an electro-activated carbon HOD system is operated
      under thermal-equilibrium conditions, no heat is needed to sustain
      the production of hydrogen once the system is started and warmed
      up to the desired operating temperature. Further, the chemical
      production (using electro-activated carbon) of hydrogen increases
      as the cell temperature increases. The chemical production
      requires no “electrolysis energy.” The chemical production of
      hydrogen benefits from the heat (temperature increase) resulting
      from the electrolysis power dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] The catalyst can further increase the performance of all
      electrolysis cells. The catalyst was found to increase the
      performance of DC electrolysis cells, and the performance of
      self-resonant electrolysis cells, particularly when the
      electrolysis cells contain aluminum (e.g., aluminum granules).
      Cell design and operational parameters can determine how much
      electro-activated carbon or other catalyst can increase the
      hydrogen-production performance and can determine the efficiency
      of electrolysis cells. The cell operation parameters which can be
      important can be operating temperature and cell chemistry.
      Operating temperature and cell chemistry can determine how much
      electro-activated carbon or how much of a particular catalyst can
      increase the hydrogen-production performance and efficiency of
      electrolysis cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] In the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      hydrogen production rates can be much higher than that of
      electrolysis or thermo-reforming processes. These exemplary
      embodiments can use external heat to start the chemical reaction
      described above, which can generally be in the temperature range
      of approximately 150 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 190
      degrees Fahrenheit, but are not limited to this temperature range.
      Generally, the reaction temperature can be as low as standard room
      temperature, and even lower, although the hydrogen generation rate
      can decrease by approximately 50% for every approximately 18-20
      degrees Fahrenheit reduction in operating temperature. The
      reaction temperature can be as high as the boiling temperature of
      water, and even higher in a steam environment where higher
      hydrogen output flow rates are required. The exemplary embodiments
      of the present disclosure are not limited to a particular
      temperature range, or to a particular pressure range. Higher
      temperatures can be provide for an apparatus that can accommodate
      steam and pressure.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Once started, as the catalytic reactions described in the
      present disclosure are fundamentally exothermic, the reactions can
      provide enough heat to sustain the reactions if the hydrogen cell
      thermodynamic equilibrium is designed to occur at the desired
      operating temperature. Thermodynamic-equilibrium operating
      conditions can be achieved when the amount of energy (heat)
      leaving the system is the same as the amount of energy (heat)
      entering the system (primarily because of the heat being generated
      by the exothermic reaction). Under these experimental conditions,
      the system temperature can remain constant, and
      externally-supplied energy may not be required for heating or
      cooling. Under different (non-thermal equilibrium) operating
      conditions, the only external energy required may be for cooling,
      if needed to limit the hydrogen production rate to, e.g., a
      desired target value, and/or limit the temperature of the cell to
      prevent boiling or excessive loss of water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, several
      experimental runs were carried out in which hydrogen peak
      production rates were obtained. It was found that there was no
      real upper limit of hydrogen generation rates, and when the
      catalyst amounts, water (or other hydrogen containing material)
      and fuel, such as aluminum are increased, substantially high rates
      of hydrogen production are possible. Experiments conducted showed
      hydrogen production rates up to 30 gallons per minute. These high
      production rates of hydrogen resulted from the use of a cell
      (similar to the one described in FIG. 5) having a cell volume of
      approximately 5 gallons. Accordingly, higher rates can be provided
      according to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure
      by, e.g., using larger cells, in which more catalyst, aluminum and
      water can be provided. It was demonstrated that controlled,
      sustained production of hydrogen can be achieved by providing
      water, aluminum and catalyst to a hydrogen-production cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] In some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      the use of electromagnetic separation can be provided. When water
      is first split, the result is H2O+CC=&gt;CC+H+OH. The H and the OH
      molecules can recombine, returning to water, which may not be
      desirable because the H molecule is then not available for
      collection and use. At the moment of the water splitting event,
      the H can be a positive ion and the OH can be a negative ion. It
      can be desirable to separate the two ions before they recombine.
      The separation can be done using electricity, such as electric
      force, magnetic force, and electromagnetic force. The use of
      electromagnetic force can be done by applying both an electric and
      a magnetic field to the water in the region where the water
      splitting event occurs. When H+ and OH- ions are created, the
      electric field can cause both ions to move as a result of the
      applied electric field. When the ions move through the magnetic
      field, they will be deflected when a component of the velocity
      vector is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field.
      Both the electric and magnetic fields act to separate the H+ ions
      from the OH- ions, thereby leading to a lower probability that the
      ions will be recombine and be removed from the hydrogen harvesting
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The development of an electromagnetic field can be achieved
      by using electrodes (anodes and cathodes) that are configured in
      the form of a coil or multiple coils, thereby leading to the
      development of an electromagnet in the region where water
      splitting events occur. The current through the electrodes can be
      direct current (DC), alternating current (AC), rectified AC
      (pulsed waveform having a DC component), or any other time-varying
      waveform including pulse trains at different frequency values
      including frequencies that can have resonance effects in the
      region where water splitting events take place.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems
      described herein can facilitate and/or provide, e.g., fuel for
      vehicles (trucks, cars, motorcycles, etc.), fuel for marine
      vessels (boats, submarines, cargo ships, etc.), power for
      generator-motor systems (GENSETs), power plants which can provide
      electricity for buildings, cities, etc., and several other
      applications where hydrogen can be used as a source of fuel/power.
      For applications requiring heater water or steam, a boiler
      apparatus can be possible due to the catalytic carbon reactions
      described herein that can produce hydrogen under water. There are
      many fields of use and embodiments contemplated by the present
      disclosure in which hydrogen production, ranging from low to very
      high flow rates, requiring no tank storage, can be used for
      various purposes, and the present disclosure is not limited to any
      particular use or purpose.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Various other considerations can also be addressed in the
      exemplary applications described according to the exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure. Various rates of hydrogen
      generation, along with different volumes of hydrogen generation,
      can be provided depending on the field of application. Different
      factors such as the amount of water, amount of fuel, such as
      aluminum, and amount of catalyst can be a factor. One skilled in
      the art can understand that routine experimentation based on the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can provide
      various rates and volumes of hydrogen generation. Controlling the
      temperature during these reactions can provide hydrogen on demand,
      and hydrogen cells can be constructed that can regulate the
      temperature of the chamber of the hydrogen cell during the
      reaction to provide hydrogen on demand to, e.g., a vehicle.<br>

      Exemplary embodiments of methods and systems for hydrogen
      production using an electro-activated material are provided. In
      some exemplary embodiments, carbon can be electro-activated and
      used in a chemical reaction with water and a fuel, such as
      aluminum, to generate hydrogen. Controlling the temperature of the
      reaction, and the amounts of water, aluminum and electro-activated
      carbon can provide hydrogen on demand at a desired rate of
      hydrogen generation<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present disclosure relates to exemplary embodiments of
      methods and systems for producing hydrogen, and more particularly,
      to exemplary embodiments of methods and systems for producing
      hydrogen from chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND INFORMATION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Hydrogen can be considered to be a promising energy
      alternative to carbon-based fuels. Various technologies have been
      developed regarding the production and use of hydrogen as a fuel
      or energy source. While hydrogen may be considered to be a clean
      and desirable energy alternative to carbon-based fuels, various
      obstacles may exist in relying on hydrogen as an energy source as
      opposed to other forms of energy. Such obstacles may generally
      include the ability to efficiently, safely and economically
      produce, transport and store hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] One approach to producing hydrogen can include
      thermochemical processes. One such process can include carrying
      out chemical reactions between a sulfur-iodine compound and water
      at high temperatures (e.g., above approximately 800 degrees C.).
      Generally, the process can result in the splitting of the water
      molecules (H2O) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2). The
      sulfur-iodine solution can be recycled in the process and
      therefore, other than hydrogen and oxygen, there may be no harmful
      byproducts.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Another approach to producing hydrogen can include the
      electrolysis of water. Electrolysis requires the use of
      electricity, in accordance with Faraday's Law. Electrolysis can be
      a relatively inefficient process for producing hydrogen without
      the aid of another energy source (beyond the supply of
      electricity). Indeed, the energy consumed may be more valuable
      than the hydrogen produced. In order to make electrolysis an
      economically viable process, another energy source can be
      incorporated into the process. For example, high-temperature
      electrolysis utilizes a high-temperature heat source to heat the
      water and effectively reduce the amount of electrical energy
      required to split the water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen
      with higher efficiencies. Another approach can involve the
      extraction of hydrogen from fossil fuels, such as natural gas or
      methanol. This method can be complex and result in residues, such
      as carbon dioxide. Also, there is a worldwide limit to the amount
      of fossil fuel available for use in the future.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Other approaches are needed to address hydrogen production,
      such that the hydrogen production may be carried out in an
      effective, efficient and safe manner. A hydrogen-based economy can
      be a long-term, environmentally-benign energy alternative for
      sustainable growth. An increasing demand for hydrogen may arise as
      the worldwide need for more electricity increases, greenhouse gas
      emission controls tighten, and fossil fuel reserves wane.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0007] At least some of the above described problems can be
      addressed by exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems
      according to the present disclosure. The present disclosure
      describes exemplary embodiments of methods and systems that can
      produce hydrogen on demand (HOD), which can make it unnecessary to
      store hydrogen in a pressurized tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure
      describe methods and systems that can make it possible to control
      and sustain the continuous production of hydrogen. The controlled,
      sustained production of hydrogen can be achieved by, e.g.,
      providing a chemical reaction with water, aluminum and an
      electro-activated material (e.g., electro-activated carbon). This
      chemical reaction can produce hydrogen at various production
      rates, and the hydrogen can be provided by, e.g., a
      hydrogen-production cell. The use of electro-activated carbon can
      make it feasible to provide a high production rate for hydrogen
      for various uses, such as but not limited to a fuel for, e.g.,
      land vehicles, marine vessels and trans-oceanic ships, and also as
      a power source for commercial power plants and other plants in
      remote locations.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure further
      describe methods and systems which can provide for safe, on-board
      and on-demand production of hydrogen close to a user system, using
      simple, safe and pollution-free metal oxidation reacting with
      water and electro-activated carbon. The electro-activated carbon
      in the exemplary embodiments can provide for a high-production
      rate, and a large-volume production of hydrogen. It can also
      provide low flow rate for applications in which smaller fuel cells
      may be required, such as, e.g., cellular phones.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] For example, according to one exemplary embodiment of the
      present disclosure, a method of producing a catalyst for hydrogen
      production can be provided, comprising placing a carbon material
      in a vessel, providing water within the vessel, and providing
      electrical current through the water to electro-activate the
      carbon material by modifying the surface of the carbon material in
      the water. The method can further comprise adding an electrolyte
      in the water in the vessel. The electrical current can be provided
      at less than 5 amps.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In some exemplary embodiments, the carbon material can be
      one or more of pure carbon, solid carbon, crushed carbon, sintered
      carbon, carbon composites, charcoal, pressed carbon, carbon
      blocks, graphite, carbon granules, granulated activated carbon or
      coal. In some exemplary embodiments, the method can further
      comprise separating the electro-activated carbon from the water
      and drying the electro-activated carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] According to another exemplary embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a method of producing hydrogen can be provided,
      comprising combining electro-activated carbon with water and
      aluminum, and providing heat to the combination of the
      electro-activated carbon, aluminum and water to produce hydrogen.
      The combination of the electro-activated carbon, aluminum and
      water can be heated to a temperature range between approximately
      150 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 190 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In some exemplary embodiments, the method can further
      comprise controlling the hydrogen production by heating the
      combination of the electro-activated carbon, aluminum and water to
      increase hydrogen production, and cooling or reducing the heat
      provided to the combination of the electro-activated carbon,
      aluminum and water to reduce hydrogen production. The method can
      further comprise controlling the hydrogen production by adding
      amounts of one or more of the electro-activated carbon, aluminum
      and water to increase the hydrogen production, and removing
      amounts of one or more of the electro-activated carbon, aluminum
      and water to decrease the hydrogen production. The water can
      comprise tap water, dirty water, high-calcium water, salt water,
      sea water, alkaline water or acidic water. In some exemplary
      embodiments, the method can further comprise mixing, burnishing or
      chopping the aluminum during hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] According to another exemplary embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a system for producing hydrogen can be provided,
      comprising a vessel having a combination of electro-activated
      carbon, fuel and water, wherein the fuel is capable of tying up an
      OH group in a water molecule in a chemical reaction, and an
      apparatus for heating the vessel to produce a chemical reaction
      between the fuel and the water causing separation of the water
      molecule to produce hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In some exemplary embodiments, the fuel can comprise
      lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, calcium, strontium,
      barium, barium oxide, pure aluminum, aluminum powder, aluminum
      granules or aluminum shavings. The fuel can comprise aluminum. In
      some exemplary embodiments, the system can further comprise one or
      more mechanisms for mixing, burnishing or chopping the aluminum
      during hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In some exemplary embodiments, the system can further
      comprise one or more mechanisms to control the hydrogen production
      in the vessel to produce hydrogen on demand. The one or more
      mechanisms can heat the combination of the electro-activated
      carbon, fuel and water to increase the hydrogen production, and
      cool or reduce the heat to the combination of the
      electro-activated carbon, fuel and water to decrease the hydrogen
      production. The one or more mechanisms can heat the combination of
      the electro-activated carbon, fuel and water to a temperature
      range between approximately 150 degrees Fahrenheit to
      approximately 190 degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In some exemplary embodiments, the hydrogen production can
      be controlled by adding amounts of one or more of the
      electro-activated carbon, fuel and water to increase the hydrogen
      production, and removing amounts of one or more of the
      electro-activated carbon, fuel and water to decrease the hydrogen
      production. The water can comprise tap water, dirty water,
      high-calcium water, salt water, sea water, alkaline water or
      acidic water.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems
      according to the present disclosure allow for hydrogen generation
      from a liquid composition such as water. Further, the by-products
      can potentially be a pollution-free source of material for
      recycling to produce more aluminum.<br>

      [0026] Throughout the figures, the same reference numerals and
      characters, unless otherwise stated, are used to denote like
      features, elements, components or portions of the illustrated
      embodiments. Moreover, while the present disclosure will now be
      described in detail with reference to the figures, it is done so
      in connection with the illustrative embodiments. It is intended
      that changes and modifications can be made to the described
      embodiments without departing from the true scope and spirit of
      the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS OF DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0027] Exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems according
      to the present disclosure will now be described, including
      reference to the figures.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Initially, in an exemplary embodiment of the present
      disclosure, a method and system for preparing a hydrogen producing
      catalyst is described. FIG. 1 illustrates a diagram of an
      activation cell 100 used to prepare a catalyst that can be used to
      produce hydrogen. In the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 1, the
      material can be carbon. The carbon can be any type of carbon of
      various forms, and the present disclosure is not limited to any
      particular form of carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The activation cell 100 can have an anode 102 and a cathode
      104. In an exemplary embodiment, the anode 102 can be placed
      inside the activation cell 100 along a first side 100a of the
      activation cell 100, and the cathode 104 can be placed inside the
      activation cell 100 along a second side 100b of the activation
      cell 100. The anode 102 can be a metal anode and the cathode 104
      can be a metal cathode, and any type of metal can be used for the
      anode 102 and cathode 104, such as stainless steel, iron,
      galvanized iron, carbon and/or other metals, and the present
      disclosure is not limited to any type of metal. The metal can be
      electrically conductive and resistant to corrosion.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] A liquid composition can be provided in the activation cell
      100, such as water 108 or other liquid containing water, or other
      suitable liquid composition, and is not limited to water. The
      water 108 can be tap water, filtered water, salt water, sea water
      and/or other types of water. A material such as carbon 106 can be
      provided in the water 108 in the activation cell 100 in the form
      of, e.g., charcoal or graphite, so that it can be
      electro-activated. The activation cell 100 can be open on a top
      surface to allow ventilation and the placement of the water 108
      and carbon 106. The water 108 can be in sufficient quantity to,
      e.g., cover the material being electro-activated. The activation
      cell 100 can be placed in a well-ventilated area such that any gas
      that is produced from the liquid during the electro-activation
      process can be ventilated.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] An electrolyte can be placed into the activation cell 100
      with the water 108 and carbon 106, which can make the mixture of
      the water 108 and carbon 106 more electrically conductive.
      Examples of electrolytes that can be used include, but are not
      limited to, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride or potassium
      hydroxide. The electro-activation can also be carried out with no
      added electrolyte, and a higher voltage may be used as the water
      can be less electrically conductive when an electrolyte is not
      added to the water. Electrical energy can be passed through the
      mixture of the water 108 and carbon 106 to electro-activate the
      carbon 106. For example, electrical energy, such as in the form of
      electrical current, can be passed through the mixture of water 108
      and carbon 106 until a value of approximately 6 Ampere-hours is
      achieved. Also, for example, a range of voltage may be used, such
      as from approximately 4 volts to approximately 200 volts.
      Typically, a voltage in the range of approximately 12 volts to
      approximately 150 volts can be used. The exemplary embodiments of
      the present disclosure are not limited to any Ampere-hours or
      voltage, and adjustments may be made based on various factors,
      such as but not limited to the amount of water, the amount of
      material (e.g., carbon), the size of the activation cell, and/or
      other factors including the current density (e.g., Amperes per
      square centimeter) which can be a function of the geometry of the
      cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The catalytic activation cell 100 can be designed to run at
      a low current, e.g., less than approximately 5 amps, and can run
      continuously with no overheating due to power dissipation in the
      catalytic activation cell 100. This can provide for
      electro-activation of the material (e.g., carbon), and thereby
      convert the material into an electro-activated material. In the
      exemplary embodiments described above, carbon can be converted
      into electro-activated carbon, which can be referred to as
      catalytic carbon. Electro-activated carbon and catalytic carbon
      are used interchangeably in the present disclosure.
      Electro-activating the carbon at a low current can provide an
      advantage that the electro-activation may not need to be monitored
      to intervene in the event of, e.g., excessive current, excessive
      temperature or excessive gas emission from the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In other exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      the catalytic activation cell 100 can be designed to run at higher
      energy levels, such as 6 Ampere hours, which can be achieved by,
      e.g., providing electric current for 6 hours at a current of 1
      Ampere, or for 3 hours at a current of 2 Amperes. In various
      embodiments of the present disclosure, different times and
      currents can be used to achieve 6 Ampere hours. The present
      disclosure is not limited to any particular Ampere-hours, and
      other Ampere-hour treatments would also produce catalytic
      transformation of the carbon.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The catalytic carbon (electro-activated carbon 106) can
      then be removed from the activation cell 100, and may be dried if
      desired. Once dried, the catalytic carbon may be easier to store
      and/or ship. The catalytic carbon may be dried by, e.g., air
      drying, heating in air, and/or other types of heating/drying
      mechanisms and/or methods. Different drying methods/processes may
      be used, and temperatures from standard room temperature to up to
      200 degrees Fahrenheit can be used, and are not limited to such.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Exemplary Catalytic Reactions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0035] In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the
      chemical reaction:<br>
      <br>
      2Al+6[H2O]+C=&gt;C+2[Al(OH)3]+3H2&nbsp; Equation (1)<br>
      <br>
      can be used, where Al is aluminum, H is hydrogen, O is oxygen and
      C is the electro-activated carbon (or catalytic carbon) formed by
      the process described above. In this exemplary catalytic reaction,
      the aluminum and water (H2O) can be used as fuels with the
      catalytic carbon, and hydrogen (H2) can be produced where the
      by-product is aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In this exemplary
      reaction, water and aluminum are fuels that can be consumed, and
      the catalytic carbon C can be a catalyst. Other liquid
      compositions having water, or having similar properties as water,
      can also be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The same reaction can be written as:<br>
      <br>
      2Al+3[H2O]+C=&gt;C+Al2O3+3H2&nbsp; Equation (2)<br>
      <br>
      where Al is aluminum, H is hydrogen, O is oxygen and C is the
      electro-activated carbon (catalytic carbon) formed by the process
      described above. In this exemplary chemical reaction, the aluminum
      and water (H2O) can be used as fuels with the catalytic carbon,
      and hydrogen (H2) can be produced where the by-product is aluminum
      oxide (Al2O3). Aluminum hydroxide can reduce to aluminum oxide
      when dried, to remove water from the aluminum hydroxide. Because
      the hydrogen-producing reaction can be carried out in water,
      Equation 1 showing an aluminum hydroxide product is the reaction
      mostly used, while Equation 2 showing an aluminum oxide product
      can also be used when describing the chemistry. In this exemplary
      reaction, water and aluminum are fuels that can be consumed, and
      the catalytic carbon C can be a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] According to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure, many different forms of carbon can be
      electro-activated as described above to produce catalytic carbon.
      For example, in various experiments performed according to the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, it has been shown
      that hydrogen can be produced using carbon in many forms, which
      can include but is not limited to, pure carbon, solid or crushed
      carbon, sintered carbon, carbon composites, charcoal, pressed
      carbon (e.g., in the form of flat plates), carbon blocks (e.g.,
      electric motor brushes) that can be formed with chemical binders,
      graphite (e.g., powdered carbon), carbon granules (e.g., for use
      as deodorizers), granulated activated carbon (GAC) that can be
      used for, e.g., water purification/filtering, and/or coal (lumped
      coal or crushed/pulverized coal).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Further, a fuel may not be required in order to generate
      hydrogen. Experiments have shown that catalytic carbon alone with
      a liquid composition, such as water or containing water, can
      produce hydrogen, according to the reaction:<br>
      <br>
      H2O+CC=&gt;CC+H+OH&nbsp; Equation (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0039] A fuel can, however, increase the rate of production of
      hydrogen in the chemical reactions shown in Equations (1) and (2).
      When hydrogen atoms are generated, they can tend to combine, as in
      H+H=&gt;H2 (a gas), which is referred to as the Toffel reaction. A
      competing reaction can also occur, such as H+OH=&gt;H2O, a
      “recombination” reaction that can prevent the hydrogen from being
      liberated in the form of H2 gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A fuel, such as aluminum, can be provided to help in this
      reaction as OH groups can be bound to the aluminum (Al) so that
      the accumulation of free (un-bound) OH groups can be largely
      prevented, such as in the liquid composition having the
      electro-activated carbon and aluminum, and the recombination with
      hydrogen atoms to form H2O can be prevented.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Other elements, chemicals or fuels having the same effect
      as aluminum can also be used. For example, chemicals that tie up
      one OH group can be helpful, such as but not limited to Li (can
      form lithium hydroxide), Na (can form sodium hydroxide), K (can
      form potassium hydroxide), Rb (can form rubidium hydroxide) and Cs
      (can form cesium hydroxide). Other chemicals can be more helpful,
      which can tie up two OH groups, such as but not limited to Ca (can
      form calcium hydroxide), Sr (can form strontium hydroxide) and Ba
      (can form barium hydroxide).<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can provide
      for aluminum as the fuel as each atom of aluminum can tie up three
      OH groups to become aluminum hydroxide, Al[OH]3, aluminum can be
      inexpensive and safe, and aluminum can have a higher chemical
      binding energy than the OH groups. Some chemicals can be even more
      helpful such as barium oxide (BaO), which can tie up as many as 4
      or 5 OH groups. Some experiments have shown that barium oxide can
      be a very good fuel with regard to hydrogen production, although
      there can be some safety issues and can generally be more
      expensive than aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Experiments were conducted to determine whether the
      electro-activation of a material, e.g., carbon, can increase
      hydrogen production. In each experiment, a catalyst was used with
      an aluminum and water mixture. In Experiment 1,
      non-electro-activated carbon was used as a catalyst. In Experiment
      2, unwashed electro-activated carbon was used as a catalyst. In
      Experiment 3, washed electro-activated carbon was used as a
      catalyst, where the electro-activated carbon was rinsed with water
      after the electro-activation of the carbon.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experiment 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0044] In Experiment 1, carbon (i.e., charcoal) was used as a
      catalyst that was not electro-activated. The chamber was cleaned,
      and approximately 3 teaspoons of aluminum powder (having a
      particle diameter of approximately 30 microns) were added to the
      chamber along with approximately 7 teaspoons of
      non-electro-activated charcoal. The chamber was filled to
      approximately 60% of the chamber with water so that the charcoal
      was slightly below the water line. A heating element was used to
      heat the mixture of the catalyst, aluminum powder and water. The
      temperature and hydrogen generation rates are provided in the
      chart below.<br>

      <br>
      [0046] In Experiment 2, carbon (i.e., charcoal) was used as a
      catalyst that was electro-activated at 6 Ampere hours. The chamber
      was cleaned, and approximately 2 teaspoons of aluminum powder
      (having a particle diameter of approximately 30 microns) were
      added to the chamber along with approximately 4 teaspoons of
      unwashed electro-activated charcoal. The chamber was filled with

      liters per minute was observed at T=27:20 at a temperature of
      approximately 154 degrees Fahrenheit. At T=28:00, the chamber was
      cooled, and the hydrogen generation rate decreased as the
      temperature decreased. At T=40:00, approximately 2 teaspoons of
      aluminum powder and approximately 2 teaspoons of electro-activated
      carbon were added to the chamber, and the heating element was
      turned on. At T=50:41, the heating element was turned off, and the
      temperature of the chamber started to drop.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In Experiment 2, it was observed that a hydrogen generation
      rate of approximately 2.5 liters per minute can be generated at a
      temperature of approximately 154 degrees Fahrenheit. It can be
      expected that a hydrogen cell having a similar amount of aluminum
      powder and catalyst could generate hydrogen at a rate of more than
      approximately 3 liters per minute at hydrogen cell temperature
      ranges of approximately 160 degrees Fahrenheit. The use of
      un-washed electro-activated carbon can increase the hydrogen
      production rate by approximately a factor of 10. In comparison,
      Experiment 2 generated hydrogen at a rate of approximately 2.5
      liters per minute, and Experiment 1 generated hydrogen at a rate
      of approximately 0.22 liters per minute where a
      non-electro-activated catalyst was used.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experiment 3</b><br>
      <br>
      [0049] In Experiment 3, carbon (i.e., charcoal) was used as a
      catalyst that was electro-activated at 6 Ampere hours. After it
      was electro-activated, the charcoal was washed with running water
      for approximately 30 minutes. The chamber was cleaned, and
      approximately 2 teaspoons of aluminum powder (having a particle
      diameter of approximately 30 microns) were added to the chamber
      along with approximately 2 teaspoons of washed electro-activated
      charcoal. The chamber was filled with water and a heating element
      was used to heat the mixture of the catalyst, aluminum powder and
      water. The temperature and hydrogen generation rates are provided
      in the chart below.<br>

      [0050] At T=4:00, the heating element was turned off. At T=5:00,
      approximately 0.5 teaspoons of aluminum powder was added. At
      T=9:08, it was observed that the chamber was running low on
      aluminum fuel. At T=12:55, a cooling element was introduced to the
      mixture of water, aluminum powder and catalyst, and a temperature
      drop was noted from T=12:55 to T=16:00.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In Experiment 3, it was observed that hydrogen can be
      generated at a rate of approximately 1 liter per minute using
      washed electro-activated carbon (i.e., charcoal) for a catalyst.
      By comparison, in Experiment 2, hydrogen was generated at a rate
      of approximately 2.5 liters per minute using unwashed
      electro-activated carbon as a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Electro-Activation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0052] In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, carbon
      (in the form of 16-mesh carbon granules) was electro-activated,
      and samples were removed at different lengths of time to determine
      how many Ampere hours produced a catalyst with a high rate of
      hydrogen production. Carbon was placed in a chamber and
      electro-activated at 2 Amperes. Sample 1 was removed after an
      electro-activation time of 1 minute, Sample 2 was removed after an
      electro-activation time of 45 minutes, Sample 3 was removed after
      an electro-activation time of 3 hours, Sample 4 was removed after
      an electro-activation time of 15 hours, and Sample 5 was removed
      after an electro-activation time of 16 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Approximately 1/8 of a teaspoon of each catalyst material
      (i.e., Samples 1-5) was placed in individual chambers having
      approximately 20 mL of water each. Water used in this experiment
      was filtered tap water. Approximately 1/8 of a teaspoon of
      aluminum powder was provided in each chamber. The mixture of the
      aluminum, water and catalyst in each chamber was then brought to a
      temperature ranging from approximately 160 degrees Fahrenheit to
      approximately 200 degrees Fahrenheit. All the chambers were
      approximately at the same temperature at any given time, as all
      the chambers were provided on one multi-chamber container vessel
      that was placed on a heating device. Hydrogen generation rates
      were observed, and all five samples generated hydrogen. It was
      found that Sample 3 produces hydrogen at a higher rate than the
      other samples, and it was found that additional electro-activation
      time to that of Sample 3 had a small effect in the hydrogen
      production rate. In this exemplary embodiment, Sample 3 was
      electro-activated at 6 Ampere hours (i.e., 3 hours at 2 Amperes).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The tests described above provide that the catalytic carbon
      prepared according to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure can be an excellent material for use in splitting water
      to produce hydrogen at high rates of production. Further, the
      tests showed that after carbon is electro-activated according to
      the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, an enhanced
      effect as a catalyst can be semi-permanent, lasting up to several
      weeks and even months. The catalytic carbon is reusable (i.e., the
      catalytic effect of the electro-activation is preserved). The
      catalytic carbon can be stored and used months later, having the
      same effect as a fresh catalyst (i.e., catalytic carbon) with
      water and aluminum as fuels. Further, the catalytic carbon can be
      used several times over with water and aluminum being the only
      consumed fuels in the exemplary catalytic reactions described in
      the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In some exemplary embodiments, it was shown that catalytic
      carbon, in trace amounts, can be left behind in the
      vessel/hydrogen cell even after washing/cleaning of the
      vessel/hydrogen cell. Accordingly, in some experiments where
      electro-activated carbon was not used, but was used previously in
      the same vessel, some hydrogen production was noted when there
      should have been close to none. Accordingly, using the same vessel
      over and over can provide certain advantages when using catalytic
      carbon to produce hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In some exemplary embodiments, it was found that “wet”
      electro-activated carbon (i.e., electro-activated carbon still wet
      from the water in the electro-activation process) produced
      hydrogen generation rates that were approximately 5-10% higher
      than the hydrogen generation rates produced when the catalytic
      carbon was dried. This can be because the wet catalytic carbon can
      have less surface-modification history. Washing the catalytic
      carbon can involve some minor surface changes at the surface of
      the carbon. Drying the catalytic carbon can also allow for
      possible surface abrasion when the carbon particles are moved,
      shifted or poured. Catalytic carbon can be a surface-reacting
      heterogeneous catalyst. In some exemplary embodiments, it has been
      shown that the carbon surface immediately following the
      electro-activation process can be optimum for hydrogen generation,
      and any surface treatment or damage following electro-activation
      (e.g., washing or drying) can result in slightly-reduced catalytic
      effectiveness when the catalytic carbon is used to split water and
      produce hydrogen in accordance with the catalytic reactions
      described in the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Carbon can exhibit good tendencies for electro-activation
      and use as a catalyst in hydrogen production with water. Carbon is
      an element that can have electronegativity similar to hydrogen and
      can form a polar bond with hydrogen. Carbon can form a polar oxide
      surface layer in water, and carbon can be pseudo-soluble in water
      in the form of a colloidal suspension of carbon particles in
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can use
      water and aluminum as fuel for the exemplary chemical reactions
      described herein. The potential use of water from various sources
      and lower cost, lower purity aluminum can provide for alternative
      low-cost sources that can be used to provide fuels for the
      catalytic reactions according to the exemplary embodiments of the
      methods and systems of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Aluminum, an element that can be used as a fuel in the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure for producing
      hydrogen, can react with acids and bases. Like other active
      metals, aluminum can dissolve in strong acids to evolve hydrogen
      gas. The catalytic carbon described in the present disclosure can
      be used in pH-neutral liquid based on its strong catalytic
      efficiency (i.e., high reaction rate). This can mean that the
      water can be neither a strong acid nor a strong alkaline liquid,
      which can provide a very safe and environmentally-friendly
      mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      aluminum shavings can be used in the chemical reactions described
      herein instead of aluminum powder. The use of electro-activated
      carbon with aluminum shavings and other non-powder forms of
      aluminum have been shown to successfully produce hydrogen in a
      laboratory.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] For a given mass of aluminum in the reaction, the hydrogen
      production rate can be approximately proportional to the surface
      area of the aluminum metal. The aluminum used in some of the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can be powdered
      aluminum. The higher surface-to-volume ratio of powdered aluminum
      can make it suitable for a higher rate of hydrogen production for
      a given amount of aluminum. More coarse fuel, which can be in the
      form of aluminum pellets, aluminum shavings, aluminum granules or
      aluminum sheets, can also be used. Such coarse fuel can provide
      for hydrogen production which can be at a lower rate (for a given
      amount of aluminum) than provided by powdered aluminum in some of
      the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Use of pure
      aluminum may not be required, which can make possible the use of
      lower cost, lower purity aluminum in the hydrogen production
      according to the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The size of the aluminum used can be a design variable for
      a particular application. For example, the particle size of the
      aluminum can be chosen to achieve a desired hydrogen production
      rate for a design that has a defined geometry and operating
      temperature. In general, for a given amount of aluminum, as the
      particle size of the aluminum decreases, the reaction rate of the
      chemical reaction described in the present disclosure goes up at
      any given temperature. Also, the reaction rate increases as the
      temperature increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, it
      was found that hydrogen is generated in the reaction described
      above without the use of aluminum (i.e., just using
      electro-activated carbon and water), but that adding certain
      fuels, such as aluminum, increased the production of hydrogen. It
      was also found that other fuels besides aluminum can be used. It
      was also found that during the catalytic reaction to generate
      hydrogen, when aluminum powder is being used, hydrogen generation
      can increase when the aluminum powder is mixed or stirred during
      the reaction. A mechanical action can be provided to remove
      aluminum oxide and expose bare aluminum. The chemical reactions
      described in Equations 1 and 2 produce hydrogen at higher rates
      when bare aluminum is used, and produce less hydrogen when using
      aluminum with an oxidized surface. In some exemplary embodiments
      of the present disclosure, by using a blender or other device to
      chop/burnish aluminum shavings and pellets, hydrogen production
      rates increased by factors of approximately two to ten, depending
      on the intensity of the mechanical or electro-mechanical action
      (i.e., chopping, burnishing and/or mixing of the aluminum). The
      factors can be dependent on the burnishing time and the time delay
      between burnishing and hydrogen production. This time delay can
      result in the formation of a film when the bare aluminum surface
      is exposed to air or water, particularly at temperatures above
      room temperature. Burnishing of the aluminum can remove the
      aluminum oxide from the surface of the aluminum, providing a fresh
      aluminum surface for the hydrogen-producing chemical reactions
      described in Equations 1 and 2 in the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] There may be other methods/devices for removing the
      oxide/hydroxide and providing a substantially bare aluminum
      surface for the hydrogen-producing reactions described in the
      present disclosure, and the present disclosure is not limited to
      any such method/device. For example, in addition or as a
      substitute to mechanical burnishing, treatments of the aluminum
      surface may also be thermal, optical or chemical.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In some exemplary embodiments, aluminum shavings can be
      reacted with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which
      can speed the chemical reactions described in the present
      disclosure reaction by a factor of 10 or more. This process can be
      a straightforward chemical reaction in which the sodium hydroxide
      undergoes a chemical change, i.e., the sodium hydroxide is
      transformed and consumed in the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The combination of the aluminum and sodium hydroxide can be
      combined with the catalytic reactions described in the present
      disclosure, i.e., Equations (1) and (2). For example, in some
      exemplary embodiments, hydrogen can be generated according to the
      following chemical reaction:<br>
      <br>
      2Al+2[NaOH]+6[H2O]+C=&gt;C+2[NaAl(OH)4]+3H2&nbsp; Equation (4)<br>
      <br>
      where the Al is aluminum, H is hydrogen, O is oxygen, NaAl(OH)4 is
      sodium tetrahydroxyaluminate, and C is electro-activated carbon
      (or catalytic carbon). In this exemplary reaction, water, aluminum
      and sodium hydroxide can be fuels that can be consumed, and the
      catalytic carbon C can be a catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In some of these exemplary embodiments, the reaction can
      begin slowly which can be due to the layer of aluminum oxide on
      the surface of the aluminum. In these exemplary embodiments, once
      the layer of aluminum oxide is pierced during the reaction, the
      reaction can then speed up. In some exemplary embodiments, the
      reaction sped up after 1 to 3 minutes, at temperatures ranging
      from standard room temperature up to 180 degrees Fahrenheit. The
      speed of the reaction can depend on various factors, such as
      temperature, and the amount of aluminum, water and/or sodium
      tetrahydroxyaluminate. Other solutions and/or elements may be used
      to speed up the catalytic reaction, such as salt (NaCl) and/or
      other electrolytes.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] According to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure, water can be used from various different sources. The
      use of pure water may not be required. Therefore, it may not be
      necessary to use distilled water or de-ionized water for the
      production of hydrogen, which can be more expensive than, e.g.,
      tap water or sea water. In exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure, various water sources were used in the exemplary
      chemical reactions, including tap water, dirty water, high-calcium
      water, salt water, sea water, alkaline water, and acidic water. In
      these experiments, it was found that all these various water
      samples worked well in the chemical reactions of the exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure for hydrogen production. In
      some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, it was found
      that some forms of water, including salt water and alkaline water,
      can provide a slightly higher rate of hydrogen production than
      more pure forms of water, such as deionized water or distilled
      water. This can be because salt water and alkaline water can have
      additives that can tend to ionize the water, which can make it
      more chemically active and/or more mobile in an aqueous solution.
      This can be because electrostatic fields, created by the polar
      oxides, form forces that move the chemicals in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The use of water from various sources can provide, e.g.,
      more design latitude and freedom to a user in selection of
      construction materials for a hydrogen cell, water and water
      ingredients to minimize corrosion of the materials used in the
      construction of a hydrogen cell and associated parts according to
      the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. Such use of
      water from various sources can provide for significant cost
      reduction by, e.g., making it possible to use a wider range of
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The use of salt water and/or sea water for hydrogen
      production according to the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure can make it suitable for marine applications, as well
      as providing an energy source for coastal areas. The exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure can provide hydrogen
      production in all parts of the world and near any seashore,
      including remote islands. Accordingly, many island nations can use
      the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure to, e.g.,
      decrease fuel costs and reduce or eliminate the need for
      tanker-ship import of fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can
      produce by-products that are fully recoverable using existing
      commercial methods for producing aluminum metal. The by-products
      from the hydrogen production methods and systems according to the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can be desirable
      because they are pure, and can contain no contaminants including
      bauxite, gibbsite, boehmite, goethite, hematite, kaolinite, and
      TiO2. The large volume of by-products of the exemplary embodiments
      of the present disclosure can be Al(OH)3 and Al2O3, which can be
      recycled to produce more aluminum metal. Recycling of aluminum
      hydroxide and aluminum oxide makes the exemplary embodiments of
      the present disclosure economically viable for large volume
      hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Aluminum refining from aluminum-bearing bauxite ore can use
      the Bayer process chemistry which can form a hydrate which can be
      essentially the same as the reaction product in the aluminum-water
      reactions described above according to the exemplary embodiments
      of the present disclosure. The hydrate can be calcined to remove
      the water to form alumina. The alumina can then be
      electrolytically reduced into metallic aluminum at about 900
      degrees Celsius using the Hall-Heroult Process, producing aluminum
      metal with 99.7% purity.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] FIG. 2 illustrates a system for the production of hydrogen
      according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. A
      hydrogen cell 200 can be provided where a heating subunit 202 can
      be provided having a heating element 208 within. The heating
      element 208 can be of various types, such as an electrical heater,
      a glow plug, a heat-exchanger coil with hot water running through
      it, but is not limited to such. A power supply, such as, e.g., a
      wire 204, can be provided to power the heating subunit 202 and/or
      heating element 208. If hot water is used to provide heat to the
      heating element 208, 204 can represent the input/output of the hot
      water. In other embodiments, the heating element may run
      independently on a battery and/or may be within the hydrogen cell
      200. Within the hydrogen cell 200, aluminum and water can be
      provided as, e.g., fuels, and catalytic carbon can be provided as,
      e.g., a catalyst. The catalytic carbon, water and aluminum can be
      in contact with each other in a mixture in the hydrogen cell 200
      as needed to, e.g., heat the mixture of the catalytic carbon,
      water and aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, one
      part catalytic carbon can be provided with one part aluminum,
      which can be in the form of aluminum powder, flakes or granules,
      with approximately three parts water, in the hydrogen cell 200.
      Various ratios of the catalytic carbon, aluminum and water can be
      used, and the present disclosure is not limited to any particular
      ratio. In some exemplary embodiments, 1-3 tablespoons of 30-micron
      aluminum powder can be used as the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The mixture of the catalytic carbon, water and aluminum can
      then be heated using the heating element 208 to a temperature of
      approximately 140 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 190 degrees
      Fahrenheit. The present disclosure is not limited to any
      temperature ranges, and various temperatures may be used according
      to different embodiments of the present disclosure. In some
      exemplary embodiments, the mixture can be heated to approximately
      180 degrees Fahrenheit, which can prevent excessive loss of water
      due to vaporization or boiling. Water evaporation (and heat loss,
      or cooling) can be controlled and limited by operating the
      hydrogen cell in a temperature range of approximately 160 degrees
      Fahrenheit to approximately 180 degrees Fahrenheit that is below
      the boiling temperature of water (i.e., 212 degrees Fahrenheit at
      sea level). From the equations described above, the reaction
      produces hydrogen and aluminum hydroxide, and the hydrogen can be
      collected at hydrogen output 206. The aluminum hydroxide can be
      collected within the hydrogen cell 200 or outside of the hydrogen
      cell 200, using appropriate structures and elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] FIG. 3 illustrates a system for the production of hydrogen
      according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. The
      system of the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3 is similar to the
      system in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 2, which can have a
      hydrogen cell 300, a wire 304 providing electrical power to a
      heating element 308 within a heating subunit 302, where catalytic
      carbon is used as a catalyst and aluminum and water are used as
      fuels. The heating element 308 heats the mixture of catalytic
      carbon, aluminum and water to produce hydrogen and aluminum
      hydroxide, and the hydrogen can be collected at hydrogen output
      306. In addition, the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3 can have a
      cooling subunit 310. For example, the cooling subunit can have
      within a cooling coil having a cold water input 312 and a water
      output 314. The cooling coil can be in contact with the mixture of
      water, aluminum and catalytic carbon. The cooling can slow down
      the reaction process, thereby decreasing the rate and volume of
      hydrogen generation. Such a system can be used to produce hydrogen
      on demand, where appropriate instruments and tools can be used to
      produce the temperatures needed to increase and slow down the rate
      and volume of hydrogen generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In an experiment of the system of FIG. 3 according to the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, the hydrogen cell
      300 was filled with approximately one pint of tap water, along
      with approximately 4 mL of aluminum powder (having a particle size
      of 3 microns) and approximately 4 mL of electro-activated carbon.
      The heating subunit 302 heated the mixture of water, aluminum
      powder and electro-activated carbon at approximately 2-3 degrees
      Fahrenheit per minute. The hydrogen cell 300 was heated for
      approximately 30 minutes, and the heating subunit was then turned
      off. The temperature of the hydrogen cell 300 at this time was
      approximately 190 degrees Fahrenheit. As shown in FIG. 6, the rate
      R of hydrogen production at time t=20 minutes was approximately
      300 mL/min, and soon after peaked at approximately 490 mL/min.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] When the hydrogen producing reaction began, the exothermic
      nature of the reaction kept the temperature at approximately 190
      degrees Fahrenheit until the fuel (i.e., aluminum powder) was
      mostly consumed at approximately t=50 minutes into the experiment.
      The total volume of hydrogen produced in the experiment was
      approximately 4 liters. At approximately t=25 minutes, cold water
      was provided into the cooling subunit 310 (i.e., cooling coil)
      through cold water input 312, and the cooling rate was measured to
      be approximately 2-3 degrees Fahrenheit per minute.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In a second experiment, using the same electro-activated
      carbon from the previous experiment, approximately 12 mL of
      aluminum powder was provided in the hydrogen cell 300. The peak
      hydrogen production rate was measured to be approximately 2.5
      liters per minute at approximately t=12 minutes. After
      approximately 25 minutes, the total volume of hydrogen gas
      produced was approximately 20 liters. After the experiments, no
      corrosion was visible on the heating subunit 302, cooling subunit
      310 or hydrogen cell 300.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The exemplary system of FIG. 3 can provide hydrogen
      “on-demand.” Heating up the hydrogen cell 300 can increase the
      temperature and increase the hydrogen production. Factors (i.e.,
      control parameters) that can be considered when generating
      hydrogen and increasing the hydrogen production can be the amount
      of water, amount of electro-activated carbon, amount and type of
      aluminum, the manner and rate of oxide/hydroxide removal from the
      aluminum surface, and the temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Cooling the hydrogen cell (e.g., by providing cold water
      into the hydrogen cell) can reduce the temperature, thereby
      reducing the hydrogen production. When providing hydrogen
      on-demand, various factors (i.e., control parameters) can be
      considered in order to decrease the rate of hydrogen production.
      For example, if the amount of water is reduced, such as by
      removing the water from the hydrogen cell, this can stop the
      production of hydrogen. Reducing the amount of electro-activated
      carbon can also reduce the amount of hydrogen production, although
      it can be difficult to completely remove all the electro-activated
      carbon, as trace amounts may still be in the hydrogen cell.
      Reducing the temperature in the hydrogen cell can also reduce the
      hydrogen production. For example, reducing the temperature of the
      hydrogen cell by approximately 18 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit can
      reduce the hydrogen production rate in the hydrogen cell by a
      factor of approximately 2. Reducing the temperature of the
      hydrogen cell by approximately another 18 to approximately 20
      degrees Fahrenheit can again reduce the hydrogen production in the
      hydrogen cell by a factor of approximately 2, and so on. This can
      be done by using a cooling subunit 310, or other devices/methods
      to reduce the temperature of the hydrogen cell 300.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Aluminum can be a more efficient fuel in the chemical
      reaction with water and electro-activated carbon when burnished
      (i.e., using mechanical scrubbing to remove aluminum oxide and/or
      aluminum hydroxide films covering the surface). If a mechanical
      action of burnishing or stirring or any other method is used to
      remove the aluminum oxide and/or aluminum hydroxide on the surface
      of the aluminum, then stopping that process or reducing that
      process in the hydrogen cell can cause aluminum oxide to form on
      the surface of the aluminum, which can reduce the hydrogen
      production. Also, removing the aluminum from the hydrogen cell or
      from the reaction can also stop the hydrogen production in the
      hydrogen cell. These control parameters can each be used alone or
      in combination with one another to slow or stop the hydrogen
      production, thereby providing hydrogen on-demand.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] It may be possible to control the maximum hydrogen
      production rate, e.g., in a vehicle, by using the vehicle's
      thermostat that regulates engine/radiator water temperature
      (typically about 195 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for a car) to
      achieve a regulated hydrogen cell temperature. At that
      temperature, a catalyst can be blended to achieve a desired
      hydrogen maximum flow rate. This can make it unnecessary to
      measure and control the hydrogen cell temperature unless the
      exothermic nature of the reaction makes it necessary to do so. If,
      due to exothermic temperature rise, the hydrogen cell temperature
      exceeds the engine/radiator water temperature in an automobile
      (typically 195 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit), the water in the
      vehicle's radiator system can then begin to cool the hydrogen
      cell, thereby providing temperature regulation. In this exemplary
      design concept, cooling from a different water (or other coolant,
      including but not limited to freon, ethylene glycol and/or
      propylene glycol) source can also be used to slow down the
      chemical reaction when the engine is stopped. Other hydrogen
      shutdown methods can be water starvation and/or aluminum
      starvation.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The systems described in the present disclosure can be
      combined with existing systems for producing hydrogen in some
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. For example, a
      hybrid system can be provided for producing hydrogen that combines
      the system(s) of the present disclosure with an electrolysis
      system. An electrolysis system can produce significant heat, and
      that heat can be used to start or to keep up the reactions
      described in the present disclosure. For example, the heat from an
      electrolysis system can start or keep up the reaction of Equation
      1, where water, aluminum and electro-activated carbon are heated
      to produce hydrogen. The hydrogen produced from either one or both
      systems can then be used for the particular purpose. This can
      provide a method and system where pH-neutral chemistry can be
      used, which is different from the prior art methods and systems
      used for generating hydrogen using electrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] There can be several advantages for using a hybrid system.
      A single chamber can provide for electro-activation of the carbon,
      as well as provide for hydrogen generation. Accordingly, the
      carbon can continuously be converted to electro-activated carbon
      and then produce hydrogen. Another advantage can be that more
      hydrogen can be produced per unit energy input than if
      electrolysis alone were used, and the power input required for
      electrolysis can be used to heat the catalytic reactions described
      in Equations 1 and 2 to a desired operating temperature. Further,
      the electrolysis chemistry can aid in oxidizing the aluminum in
      the catalytic reactions described in Equations 1 and 2 to tie up
      OH chemical groups when the water is split into H and OH groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In some exemplary embodiments, a hybrid system can use
      electrolysis and catalytic carbon in combination to produce
      hydrogen. Often, when using electro-activated carbon with a fuel,
      such as aluminum, aluminum oxide and aluminum hydroxide can be
      formed in the form of large solids. These solids can be large, and
      can be difficult to remove during operation of the cell as well as
      during maintenance of the cell. If a low current electrolysis is
      used in the liquid composition containing the electro-activated
      carbon and aluminum, then formation of these large solids can be
      prevented, such that only very small grains of aluminum oxide and
      aluminum hydroxide are formed. Another advantage of providing
      electrolysis to the cell can be that the energy deposited in the
      liquid can be a source of heat. Heat can be used for the catalytic
      carbon reaction to produce hydrogen at a higher rate, such that
      the hydrogen production rate can double with every increase in
      temperature of approximately 18 to approximately 20 degrees
      Fahrenheit. Various other combinations of hybrid systems are
      contemplated by the present disclosure and are not limited to the
      above.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      experiments were run to test the purity of the hydrogen produced
      based on the chemical reaction of Equation 1. The
      electro-activated carbon in this experiment was electro-activated
      at 6 Ampere hours. Approximately 400 mL of high-purity HPLC grade
      water was provided in a chamber of a hydrogen cell and heated to
      approximately 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, approximately 12 grams
      of the electro-activated carbon and approximately 18 grams of
      aluminum powder were added into the chamber of the hydrogen cell.
      The reaction achieved a maximum hydrogen generation rate of
      approximately 200 mL/min. It was determined through measurement
      instrumentation that the hydrogen produced by this reaction was
      approximately 93% pure. The hydrogen production began with air in
      the chamber of the hydrogen cell and in the tubes leading to the
      measurement instrumentation for the testing of the hydrogen
      purity. The remaining 7% can be air which can contain water vapor,
      and the amount of the water vapor can depend on the temperature of
      the hydrogen cell during the reaction. In this configuration,
      using the reactions described in Equation 1, the hydrogen
      automatically separates from the catalytic carbon, water and
      aluminum, and there was no need for a phase separator in the
      measurement for the hydrogen purity.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] FIG. 4 illustrates a system for providing hydrogen as a
      fuel to a vehicle according to exemplary embodiments of the
      present disclosure. The system can comprise of two primary
      vessels, a bubbler 400 and a hydrogen cell 406. The hydrogen cell
      406 can be connected to the bubbler 400 by a tube 402 through
      which hydrogen bubbles can rise from the hydrogen cell 406 to the
      bubbler 400. The hydrogen cell 406 can be heated with a glow plug
      405, or some other type of heating element/device. The glow plug
      405 or other heating element can be electronically controlled to
      maintain a hydrogen cell temperature, e.g., approximately 180
      degrees Fahrenheit, using a thermistor temperature sensor 407 or
      other similar temperature sensing and controlling device. Water,
      aluminum (e.g., aluminum powder) and catalytic carbon can be
      placed in the hydrogen cell 406.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] A water level 401 can be maintained such that the hydrogen
      cell 406 can be full of the mixture of the water, aluminum powder
      and catalytic carbon, and the bubbler 400 can be partially filled
      with the mixture up to the water level 401. A mechanical action
      can be added into the hydrogen cell in order to burnish/stir/mix
      the aluminum if desired to remove any aluminum oxide from the
      aluminum surface in order to generate more hydrogen, if needed.
      Once heated, hydrogen bubbles will rise to the chamber area 403 in
      the bubbler 400 using gravity flow, and the hydrogen gas can be
      provided to an air-intake manifold of the vehicle engine through
      outlet 404.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In an experiment using the exemplary system of FIG. 4, the
      hydrogen cell 406 and bubbler 400 were attached to an engine of a
      test vehicle using brackets to hold the hydrogen cell 406 and
      bubbler 400, and the outlet 404 was connected to an air-intake
      manifold of the engine of the test vehicle. No oxygen sensor
      adjustments or other engine modifications were implemented. Under
      normal driving conditions (i.e., no hydrogen), the test vehicle
      achieved approximately 26-28 miles per gallon during highway
      driving using regular unleaded fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The first (non-optimized) experimental operation of the
      test vehicle showed that providing hydrogen produced a dramatic
      increase in miles per gallon. At t=0 minutes, the hydrogen cell
      406 was charged with approximately 2 teaspoons of aluminum powder,
      approximately 2 teaspoons of catalytic carbon, and water. The
      heating element (i.e., glow plug) was turned on. Initial heating
      and hydrogen flow took approximately 5 minutes. Hydrogen was
      formed in the chamber 403 of the bubbler 400. At t=5 minutes, the
      test vehicle was started with hydrogen flowing from the outlet 404
      to the vehicle engine. The electronic fuel injection (EFI)
      computer automatically began operation in the open loop mode
      (i.e., normal engine start-up mode, with no feedback signals from
      the oxygen sensors) to closed loop (i.e., normal mode after the
      engine warms up, using feedback signals from the oxygen sensors).
      During this warm-up period, hydrogen was flowing from the hydrogen
      system output 404 to the air-intake manifold of the engine of the
      test vehicle. The test vehicle was brought to a speed of
      approximately 55 miles per hour on a highway, and the hydrogen
      flow rate was estimated to be approximately 0.3 liters per minute.
      The vehicle was obtaining approximately 37 miles per gallon as
      measured by a scan gauge adjusted to measure real-time mileage in
      units of miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] At t=10 minutes, the hydrogen flow rate was noted to be
      decreasing with time. The test vehicle was getting approximately
      35.7 miles per gallon. The solenoid valve (provided in the
      plumbing between the outlet 404 to the engine of the vehicle) was
      switched so that hydrogen was vented to the air (not piped to
      engine). The miles per gallon dropped approximately 6.7%, from
      approximately 35.7 miles per gallon to approximately 33.3 miles
      per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The test vehicle demonstrated a 32% increase in miles per
      gallon during the first non-optimized experimental run. In several
      subsequent test runs with some refinements (i.e., higher hydrogen
      flow rates), the vehicle demonstrated up to a 40% increase in
      miles per gallon.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Conventional methods of producing hydrogen (e.g.,
      electrolysis, thermo-forming, etc.) can produce hydrogen at low
      rates when measured in units of volume per minute, or liters per
      minute (LPM) per gram of material per joule of required energy, or
      LPM/gm per joule. Using this exemplary benchmark for production
      rate evaluation leads to the conclusion that electrolysis and
      thermo-reforming are poor performers simply because of the high
      energy (measured in joules) required to drive the processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] In the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure,
      hydrogen production rates can be much higher than that of
      electrolysis or thermo-reforming processes. These exemplary
      embodiments can use external heat to start the chemical reaction
      described above, which can generally be in the temperature range
      of approximately 150 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 190
      degrees Fahrenheit, but are not limited to this temperature range.
      Generally, the reaction temperature can be as low as standard room
      temperature, and even lower, although the hydrogen generation rate
      can decrease by approximately 50% for every approximately 18-20
      degrees Fahrenheit reduction in operating temperature. The
      reaction temperature can be as high as the boiling temperature of
      water, and even higher in a steam environment where higher flow
      rates are required. The exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure are not limited to a particular temperature range.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Once started, as the catalytic reactions described in the
      present disclosure are fundamentally exothermic, the reactions can
      provide enough heat to sustain the reactions if the hydrogen cell
      thermodynamic equilibrium is designed to occur at the desired
      operating temperature. Thermodynamic-equilibrium operating
      conditions can be achieved when the amount of energy (heat)
      leaving the system is the same as the amount of energy (heat)
      entering the system (primarily because of the heat being generated
      by the exothermic reaction). Under these experimental conditions,
      the system temperature can remain constant, and
      externally-supplied energy may not be required for heating or
      cooling. Under different (non-thermal equilibrium) operating
      conditions, the only external energy required may be for cooling,
      if needed to limit the hydrogen production rate to, e.g., a
      desired target value, and/or limit the temperature of the cell to
      prevent boiling or excessive loss of water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, several
      experimental runs were carried out in which hydrogen peak
      production rates of approximately 400 mL/minute to approximately 4
      liters/minute were obtained in a cell, where in each cell tap
      water was provided with approximately 10 grams to approximately 40
      grams of powdered aluminum, and approximately 2 teaspoons of
      catalytic carbon that had been electro-activated for approximately
      6 Ampere hours. These experimental cells had reaction-chamber
      volumes ranging from approximately 100 mL to approximately 1
      liter. High rates of hydrogen production were demonstrated in the
      experimental runs (e.g., approximately 400 mL/minute to
      approximately 4 liters/minute) at temperatures ranging from
      approximately 160 degrees Fahrenheit to approximately 190 degrees
      Fahrenheit. Higher rates can be provided according to the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure by, e.g., using
      larger cells, in which more catalytic carbon, aluminum and water
      can be provided. It was demonstrated that controlled, sustained
      production of hydrogen can be achieved by providing water,
      aluminum and catalytic carbon to a hydrogen-production cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Many other applications for hydrogen production are
      contemplated by the present disclosure along with providing fuels
      for land and marine vessels, as well as for power generation
      (e.g., power plants). As shown in FIG. 5, a boiler system can be
      provided according to exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure, to provide heat for a building structure, such as a
      home or commercial building. As shown in the exemplary boiler
      system of FIG. 5, a hydrogen cell 508 can be provided, in which
      water, aluminum and catalytic carbon can be provided to produce
      hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas, though gravity/buoyancy flow, will
      proceed in an upwards direction 510 to a boiler system 500 (or
      alternatively, can be directed to the boiler system 500 through
      appropriate tubing/piping in another exemplary design).<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Hydrogen bubbles 512 will proceed in an upwards direction
      to a water level 511 in the boiler system 500. A water inlet 507
      (which can be room temperature or hot water) and a water outlet
      509 can be provided in the boiler system 500. Air can be injected
      in the water or close to the surface of the water level 511 where
      the hydrogen bubbles 512 appear by, e.g., a hose, pipe, air
      compressor, valve, air pressure regulator or other such type of
      device. An igniter 506 can be provided to ignite the combustible
      mixture of hydrogen and air, to provide a flame 502 within the
      boiler system 500. The heat provided by the flame in the boiler
      system 500 can be supplied to a heating element, such as fins or
      other heat-radiating elements for use as a heater, or the water
      can be heated without heat radiating elements because of the
      direct flame-to-water contact.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In another exemplary embodiment of the system of FIG. 5, a
      boiler system can be operated at a pressure higher than 1
      atmosphere, and steam can be provided through outlet 504 to, e.g.,
      drive turbines to make electricity or provide heat. The operation
      of a pressurized steam boiler can be fitted with pressure
      regulators and other equipment designed for both control and
      safety of operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] There can be many advantages to a boiler system using
      hydrogen as described in FIG. 5. For example, since a burner is
      not required, there is no burner corrosion or maintenance
      required. The flame can be in direct contact with the water to
      heat the water. There is no firebox (furnace) required, and there
      are no hot gas tubes, fly-ash build up (typically a problem for
      coal-burning furnace/boiler systems) and no maintenance of the
      tubes is required. There is no smokestack required, and the
      combustion products are merely water/steam. Further, there are no
      unwanted effluents or emissions and no environmental
      contamination.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] Fossil fuel shortage can be a worldwide problem in the
      coming years. Fuel transport and storage can also be a major
      logistics support problem, such as for mobile military units. The
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can make it
      possible to reduce the need for transport and storage of large
      volumes of fossil fuel. The availability of fuel in the exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure can be based on the
      availability of water and aluminum. Dry aluminum is not explosive
      under normal conditions, and it can be easy to transport and
      store. It may not require special handling or special shelter
      requirements because when exposed to natural weather extremes it
      quickly forms a protective oxide which can prevent erosion,
      corrosion or other damage to the aluminum. Water can be
      transported easily in various forms. Tap water, sea water, salt
      water and/or any type of water may be used as a fuel in the
      exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] There are only a few materials that can produce abundant
      hydrogen and these can include hydrocarbons and water. Of these
      materials, water can be a pollution free source of hydrogen. One
      of the problems that must be addressed before a new hydrogen
      economy replaces the current “oil/gas/coal/nuclear” economy, can
      be finding a safe, environmentally benign and cost-effective
      method of generating hydrogen at a desired rate. The exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure provide safe, cost-effective
      and environmentally-benign methods and systems of hydrogen
      generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Carbon, water, aluminum, aluminum oxide and aluminum
      hydroxide can be some of the safest materials known (e.g., they
      are commonly used in foods, drugs, cosmetics and other safe to
      use/handle products). The exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure provide these elements in methods and systems that work
      using a wide range of pH, which can include neutral pH values in
      the range of 6 to 8. The use of neutral pH chemistry can eliminate
      the threat of acid burns or alkali burns to human skin and eyes.
      Alkali-burn damage to the eyes, due to an accidental splash, can
      be a safety hazard when using electrolytes with electrolysis to
      produce hydrogen. Electrolysis can fundamentally require the use
      of a strong electrolyte to increase the electrical conductivity of
      the water, whereas the exemplary embodiments of the present
      disclosure can produce hydrogen chemically, without the use of
      electrolysis and without the requirement for electrolyte
      additives. The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can
      be safe and manageable by simple care.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Some metals other than aluminum can spontaneously produce
      hydrogen when those metals come in contact with water. For
      example, metals such as potassium (K) and sodium (Na) can produce
      hydrogen when they come in contact with water. However, the
      residual hydroxide product (i.e., KOH in the sodium reaction) can
      be corrosive, dangerous to handle and potentially polluting to the
      environment. These metals can be used as water-splitting agents
      through a simple reaction, which can proceed spontaneously once
      the metal is dropped into water, but these reactions can be less
      safe than aluminum and cannot be controlled as easily as aluminum
      and the reactions described in the exemplary embodiments of the
      present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The exemplary embodiments of the methods and systems
      described herein can facilitate and/or provide, e.g., fuel for
      vehicles (trucks, cars, motorcycles, etc.), fuel for marine
      vessels (boats, submarines, cargo ships, etc.), power for power
      plants which can provide electricity for buildings, cities, etc.,
      and several other applications where hydrogen can be used as a
      source of fuel/power. For applications requiring heater water or
      steam, a boiler apparatus can be possible due to the catalytic
      carbon reactions described herein that can produce hydrogen under
      water. There are many fields of use and embodiments contemplated
      by the present disclosure in which hydrogen production, ranging
      from low to very high flow rates, requiring no tank storage, can
      be used for various purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Various other considerations can also be addressed in the
      exemplary applications described according to the exemplary
      embodiments of the present disclosure. Various rates of hydrogen
      generation, along with different volumes of hydrogen generation,
      can be provided depending on the field of application. Different
      factors such as the amount of water, amount of fuel, such as
      aluminum, and amount of electro-activated carbon can be a factor.
      One skilled in the art can understand that routine experimentation
      based on the exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure can
      provide various rates and volumes of hydrogen generation.
      Controlling the temperature during these reactions can provide
      hydrogen on demand, and hydrogen cells can be constructed that can
      regulate the temperature of the chamber of the hydrogen cell
      during the reaction to provide hydrogen on demand to, e.g., a
      vehicle.<br>
