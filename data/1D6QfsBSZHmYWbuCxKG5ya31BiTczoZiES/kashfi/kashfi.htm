      <br>
      A POTENT “super aspirin” that can cause cancer cells to
      self-destruct has been developed by scientists.<br>
      <br>
      The hybrid version is much more ­powerful than the conventional
      painkiller but far less toxic.<br>
      <br>
      Prolonged use of traditional aspirin can cause stomach ulcers and
      kidney failure.<br>
      <br>
      But the new compound, known as NOSH, can be used in lower doses
      and has fewer side effects.<br>
      <br>
      In tests on mice, it has been shown to shrink cancer cells by 85
      per cent.<br>
      <br>
      The pill is effective against 11 different forms of cancer,
      including colon, pancreatic, prostate, breast and ­leukaemia,
      researchers have found.<br>
      ì<br>
      “If what we have seen in animals can be translated to humans it
      could be used in conjunction with other drugs to shrink tumours
      before chemotherapy or surgery".<br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
      </div>
      Hailing the breakthrough yesterday, ­Professor Khosrow Kashfi
      said: “If what we have seen in animals can be translated to humans
      it could be used in conjunction with other drugs to shrink tumours
      before chemotherapy or surgery.”<br>
      <br>
      Professor Kashfi, of the Sophie Davis School of Biomedical
      Education at The City College of New York, added: “The key
      components of this new compound are that it is very, very potent
      and yet it has minimal toxicity to normal cells.”<br>
      <br>
      Previous research has shown that ordinary aspirin can reduce the
      size of some tumours by up to half. But prolonged use of the old
      form of the drug can have serious side effects such as excessive
      bleeding.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Professor Kashfi said: “There’s a lot of data on aspirin showing
      that when taken on a regular basis, on average it reduces the risk
      of development of colon cancer by about 50 per cent compared to
      non-users.”<br>
      <br>
      Only 24 hours after treating a culture of cancer cells, the NOSH
      aspirin demonstrated 100,000 times greater potency than aspirin
      alone.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Kashfi said: “At 72 hours it is about 250,000 times more
      potent in an in-vitro cell culture against human colon cancer. So
      you need a lower amount to get the same result.”<br>
      <br>
      The new drug is a hybrid of two compounds, one of which releases
      nitric oxide to protect the stomach lining and the other releases
      hydrogen sulfide to increase its cancer-fighting ability.<br>
      <br>
      Lower doses would minimise or potentially eliminate its side
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      In a second study, when mice bearing human colon cancer tumours on
      their flanks were given NOSH aspirin, the compound caused cancer
      cells to self-destruct, inhibited the proliferation of the cells
      and significantly reduced tumour growth without any signs of
      toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      Writing in the journal ACS Medicinal Chemistry Letters, Professor
      Kashfi said any working therapy for humans was still years away,
      but toxicity testing and clinical trials would be the next step.<br>
      <br>
      His findings will be presented at the annual meeting of the
      American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago next month.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Kat Arney, science information manager at Cancer Research UK,
      said: “Scientists have been investigating the cancer-fighting
      properties of aspirin for many years, although prolonged use can
      cause side effects such as stomach bleeds.<br>
      <br>
      “It will be interesting to see how this particular compound
      progresses, although much more research is needed to show whether
      it’s safe and effective for use in humans.”<br>

      Compounds are disclosed with activity towards killing
      dysproliferative cells in vitro and treating cancer in vivo.
      Cancers such as cancer of the colon, pancreas, prostate, lung,
      breast, urinary bladder, skin and liver are exemplary. Compounds,
      pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use are described.<br>
      <br>
      The invention is directed to compounds that inhibit the growth of
      dysproliferative cells and can be used to treat cancer. The
      invention is further directed to the synthesis and uses for said
      compounds as well as compositions comprising said compounds.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
      <br>
      Dysproliferative diseases including neoplasms such as cancer
      remain a major health problem accounting for significant morbidity
      and mortality in the US and nearly all of the rest of the world.<br>
      <br>
      Despite substantial progress in the last two decades, there remain
      many cancers for which currently available methods are either
      partially or totally ineffective. Thus novel agents or methods are
      needed either to prevent the development of cancer, or, in the
      case where neoplasia has already developed, to render the host
      organism cancer-free or to reduce its neoplastic burden to a level
      compatible with life or at least to facilitate the use of
      concomitant therapies.<br>
      <br>
      There has been significant progress in understanding the
      fundamental processes underlying the development of neoplasia. In
      its essence, neoplasia, including cancer, can be viewed as the
      inappropriate accumulation of cells, in violation of the exquisite
      balance between cell renewal and cell death. For neoplasia to
      develop, either cell renewal must be increased or cell death
      decreased or both. A corollary to this relationship is that an
      agent that affects these processes favorably for the host organism
      (and, consequently, unfavorably for the neoplasm), is a potential
      antineoplastic drug.<br>
      <br>
      One approach to develop new antineoplastic agents is to synthesize
      novel chemical compounds and screen them for their effect on cell
      growth. This is achieved by determining the number of a given set
      of cells following their exposure to the agent under evaluation
      and comparing it to that of untreated control cells. For an agent
      to have antineoplastic properties, it must inhibit the growth of
      neoplastic cells compared to untreated control, so that its
      sustained or repeated application will progressively diminish the
      tumor mass, ultimately leading to the extinction of neoplasia. It
      is also a logical extension of these considerations that other
      diseases such as, for example, psoriasis in which cell kinetic
      abnormalities, in other words abnormalities in cell renewal or
      cell death, contribute to their pathogenesis, will be amenable to
      treatment by such agents.<br>
      <br>
      It is toward the identification of novel compounds with
      antineoplastic properties, and the identification of unexpected
      antineoplastic activity in compounds otherwise known in the art,
      that the present application is directed....<br>

        Abstract</span> --&nbsp; A series of new hybrids of aspirin
      (ASA), bearing both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide
      (H2S)-releasing moieties were synthesized and designated as NOSH
      compounds (1–4). NOSH-1 (4-(3-thioxo-3H-1,2-dithiol-5-yl) phenyl
      2-((4-(nitrooxy)butanoyl)oxy) benzoate); NOSH-2 (4-(nitrooxy)butyl
      (2-((4-(3-thioxo-3H-1,2-dithiol-5-yl)phenoxy)carbonyl)phenyl));
      NOSH-3 (4-carbamothioylphenyl
      2-((4-(nitrooxy)butanoyl)oxy)benzoate); and NOSH-4
      (4-(nitrooxy)butyl 2-(5-((R
      )-1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoyloxy)benzoate). The cell growth
      inhibitory properties of compounds 1–4 were evaluated in eleven
      different human cancer cell lines of six different tissue origins.
      These cell lines are of adenomatous (colon, pancreatic, lung,
      prostate), epithelial (breast), and lymphocytic (leukemia) origin.
      All NOSH compounds were extremely effective in inhibiting the
      growth of these cell lines. NOSH-1 was the most potent, with an
      IC50 of 48 ± 3 nM in HT-29 colon cancer cells. This is the first
      NSAID-based compound with such potency. This compound was also
      devoid of any cellular toxicity, as determined by LDH release.
      NOSH-1 was comparable to aspirin in its anti-inflammatory
      properties, using the carrageenan rat paw edema model.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="noshaspirin.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in general, and
      aspirin, in particular, are recognized as the prototypical
      chemopreventive agents against many forms of cancers.(1) However,
      long-term use of NSAIDs may lead to serious side effects,
      including gastrointestinal and renal.(1) The search for “better
      NSAIDs” has led to the development of selective cyclooxygenase-2
      inhibitors (Coxibs) and nitric oxide-releasing NSAIDs (NO-NSAIDs).
      Several large-scale clinical trials have shown that long-term use
      of coxibs is associated with an increased risk of adverse
      myocardial events.(2)<br>
      <br>
      The development of NO-NSAIDs was based on the observation that NO
      has some of the same properties as prostaglandins within the
      gastric mucosa. Therefore, coupling an NO-releasing moiety to an
      NSAID might deliver NO to the site of NSAID-induced damage,
      thereby decreasing gastric toxicity. Animal and human studies have
      shown that many NO-NSAIDs are indeed safer to the GI mucosa than
      the parent NSAID.(3, 4)<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a new class of NSAIDs possessing a hydrogen sulfide
      (H2S)-releasing moiety (HS-NSAIDs) have been described in the
      literature.(5-9) We have shown that these compounds can be useful
      in controlling cancer.(10-12) However, NO-NSAIDs and HS-NSAIDs
      have several drawbacks, limiting their development as
      pharmaceuticals. For example, HS-NSAIDs have relatively high IC50s
      for cell growth inhibition. Some NO-NSAIDs can form quinone
      methide intermediates, questioning the role of NO in their
      biological activity.(13-15) Others yet have high IC50s for cell
      growth inhibition.(16) Therefore, we postulated that a new hybrid
      that incorporated the active parts of each compound might be more
      potent than either one alone. Our hypothesis has proved to be
      correct. Here we describe the synthesis of four NOSH (nitric
      oxide-, hydrogen sulfide-releasing) compounds that release both
      H2S and NO (Figure 1). One of the compounds, NOSH-1, has IC50s for
      cell growth inhibition in the low nanomolar range and shows strong
      anti-inflammatory properties.<br>

      <br>
      The NOSH compounds reported here were developed by using aspirin
      as a scaffold to which NO and H2S releasing moieties were coupled
      with one of the 1, 2 positions. We used nitrate (-ONO2) for NO
      release and attached it to the aspirin through an aliphatic
      spacer, while one of the following H2S-releasing moieties,
      5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (ADT-OH), or
      4-hydroxy benzothiazamide (TBZ) or lipoic acid were directly
      coupled to aspirin (NOSH-1–4, Figure 1). Salicylaldehyde was used
      as the starting material for NOSH-1–3, and aspirin was used for
      NOSH-4.<br>
      <br>
      Salicylaldehyde (5) coupled with 4-bromobutyric acid (6) in the
      presence of DCC/DMAP was used to yield compound 7. The bromo
      moiety in compound 7 was then substituted with nitrate using AgNO3
      to give compound 8. Then the aldehyde group of compound 8 was
      oxidized to its corresponding carboxylic group in the presence of
      KMnO4 to yield compound 9.(17) This was then used as the precursor
      for preparation of NOSH-1 and -3 using either
      5-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione (ADT-OH, 10) or
      4-hydroxythiobenzamide (TBZ, 11), respectively (Scheme 1).<br>

      <br>
      For preparation of compound NOSH-2, salicyladehyde (5), succinic
      anhydride (12), and a catalytic amount of DMAP in methylene
      chloride were treated for 24 h, at room temperature, to prepare
      the succinic acid linked intermediate. To this intermediate in
      situ were added hydroxybutyl nitrate (13) and DCC to afford
      compound 14. This was further oxidized by KMnO4 to its
      corresponding aromatic carboxylic acid (15), which was coupled to
      ADT-OH (10) in the presence of DCC/DMAP in methylene chloride to
      give NOSH-2 (Scheme 2).<br>

      NOSH-4 was synthesized by using lipoic acid as H2S-releasing
      donor. We used aspirin as the starting material and coupled it
      with compound 13 in the presence of DCC/DMAP to give 16.(18) This
      then underwent deacetylation by K2CO3 in THF/MeOH (1:1) to produce
      compound 17.(19) This was then coupled with (R)-lipoic acid (18)
      in the presence of DCC/DMAP to produce NOSH-4 (Scheme 3).<br>

      We investigated the effects of NOSH-1–4 and ASA on the growth
      properties of eleven different cancer cell lines of six different
      histological subtypes. The cell lines were that of colon (HT-29,
      COX-1 and COX-2 positive; HCT 15, COX null; and SW480, COX-1
      positive, low levels of endogenous COX-2), breast (MCF7, [ER(+)];
      MDA MB-231 and SKBR3, [ER(-)]), T-cell leukemia (Jurkat), pancreas
      (BxPC3, both COX-1 and COX-2 positive; MIAPaCa-2, COX-null),
      prostate (LNCaP), and lung (A549). All four NOSH compounds were
      extremely effective in inhibiting the growth of these cell lines
      (Table 1). NOSH-1 was very potent, and its IC50 for cell growth
      inhibition ranged from 48 to 280 nM. The corresponding IC50 values
      for NOSH-2, -3, and -4 were 70–120, 4300–7500, and 240–800 nM,
      respectively. The growth inhibition by NOSH-1–4 versus traditional
      ASA was very high in the cell lines studied. In a fold comparison
      study of the IC50 values (ASA/NOSH-1–4), NOSH-1 was at least
      100,000-fold more potent than ASA in HT-29 colon cancer cells. The
      increases in potency for NOSH-2, -3, and -4 in the same cell line
      were &gt;60,000-fold, &gt;600-fold, and &gt;16,000-fold,
      respectively. In general, NOSH-1 was the most potent in all cell
      lines. Cyclooxygenase (COX) represents the best-known mechanistic
      target of NSAIDs. An interesting aspect of growth inhibition also
      emerges with respect to COX expression in the cell lines examined.
      NOSH-1–4 showed similar effects on two colon cancer cell lines,
      HT-29 (expresses COX-1 and COX-2) and HCT 15 (no COX
      expression),(20) and on two pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC-3
      (expresses COXs) and MIA PaCa-2 (no COX expression),(21)
      suggesting a COX-independent effect.<br>

      Colon, breast, pancreas, lung, prostate, and leukemia cancer cell
      lines were treated with various concentrations of NOSH-1, NOSH-2,
      NOSH-3, NOSH-4, and aspirin (ASA). Cell viability was determined
      at 24 h, from which IC50 values were calculated. Results are mean
      ± SEM of at least four different experiments performed in
      triplicate. P &lt; 0.001 for all NOSH compounds compared to ASA in
      all cell lines.<br>
      <br>
      This high degree of potency raised the question as to how toxic
      this compound was to the cells. To assess this, we used lactate
      dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a measure of cellular toxicity.
      Cells were treated with several concentrations of NOSH-1 for 2–24
      h and compared to untreated controls. Although the cytotoxicity
      caused by NOSH-1 was both dose- and time-dependent, this was
      minimal (Figure 2). At 4-times its IC50, LDH release was less than
      10% at 24 h. LDH release for shorter durations of treatment (2 h,
      4 h, 6 h, and 8 h) ranged between 0.5 and 4% at its IC50 and
      between 1 and 5% at 4-times its IC50. This demonstrates a
      remarkable degree of safety for a compound that is so potent.<br>

      The most common use for NSAIDs (including aspirin) is the
      treatment of inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we wanted to
      compare the COX-dependent anti-inflammatory activity of ASA to
      that of NOSH-1. This was done by using the rat paw edema model, as
      described in the Supporting Information. After inducing
      inflammation in rat’s paw with carrageenan, animals receiving
      vehicle showed a fast time-dependent increase in paw volume (?V =
      1.1 mL) after 2–3 h, which decreased gradually every hour
      thereafter until the end of the experiment (6 h) (Figure 3A). In
      contrast, animals receiving ASA showed a weak inflammatory
      response (?V = 0.4 mL) at 1 h, decreasing to about ?V = 0.35 mL
      over the next 2 h and then decreasing to about ?V = 0.35 mL after
      6 h. The anti-inflammatory effect registered in animals treated
      with NOSH-1 was dose-dependent. Rats treated with low dose NOSH-1
      (0.21 mmol/kg) showed a change in paw volume ?V = 0.5 mL after 1 h
      which increased to ?V = 0.6 mL by 3 h and then came down to about
      ?V = 0.4 mL over the next 3 h. Rats treated with high dose NOSH-1
      (0.52 mmol/kg), a dose which was slightly less than that of ASA
      (0.56 mmol/kg), showed a plateaued change in paw volume of ?V =
      0.45 mL after 1–2 h, which then deceased steadily over the next 4
      h to ?V = 0.35 mL, a change that was comparable to that of ASA
      (Figure 3A).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3. Anti-inflammatory
        properties of NOSH-1. </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Rat paw edema was induced by carrageenan injection. (A) ASA and
      NOSH-1 caused a significant reduction in paw volume at all time
      points. Results are mean ± SEM of four rats in each group; *P &lt;
      0.05 versus vehicle treated rats at all time points. (B) ASA and
      NOSH-1 caused a significant reduction in PGE2 levels in the paw
      exudate. Results are mean ± SEM for four rats in each group; *P
      &lt; 0.01versus vehicle. (C) NOSH-1 inhibits induction of COX-1
      and COX-2 by carrageenan. Results show one animal is the control,
      four are in carrageenan injected, and two are in NOSH-1 treated at
      two different doses.<br>
      <br>
      Prostaglandins (PGE2) are the main product of
      cyclooxygenase-mediated arachidonic acid metabolism.(1) Comparison
      of PGE2 content of paw exudates from control, ASA-treated, and
      NOSH-1-treated animals showed a clear and significant COX
      inhibition by aspirin and NOSH-1. Figure 3B shows that aspirin
      (0.21 mmol/kg) caused a considerable decrease in PGE2 levels (12 ±
      3 pg/mg protein) compared with the control group (82 ± 2 pg/mg).
      Treatment with NOSH-1 reduced PGE2 levels to 42 ± 3 and 21 ± 4
      pg/mg at 0.21 and 0.52 mmmol/kg, respectively. We further
      evaluated the effect of NOSH-1 on COX expression in paw exudates.
      Figure 3C shows that COX-1 was constitutively expressed in the
      controls; this was induced by carrageenan and inhibited to the
      same extent by NOSH-1 regardless of the dose. On the other hand,
      COX-2, which produces inflammatory PGE2, was barely detectable in
      the controls, was significantly induced by carrageenan, and was
      dose-dependently inhibited by NOSH-1.<br>
      <br>
      We also determined the inhibitory effect of ASA and NOSH-1 on
      proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in plasma
      obtained from control and NOSH-1-treated animals. Administration
      of ASA (0.56 mmol/kg) increased the TNF-a concentration by about
      20-fold (10 ± 1 control and 200 ± 10 pg/mL ASA); however, this
      rise was considerably lower in the NOSH-1 (55 ± 2 pg/mL at 0.21
      mmol/kg and 40 ± 3 pg/mL at 0.52 mmol/kg) treated animals (Figure
      4).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4. Effect of ASA and
        NOSH-1 on plasma TNF-a. </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      ASA caused a significant rise in plasma TNF-a; however, this rise
      was significantly less in the NOSH-1 treated rats. Results are
      mean ± SEM for four rats in each group; *P &lt; 0.01 vs vehicle,
      †P &lt; 0.01 vs ASA.<br>
      <br>
      The NOSH compounds were designed to release both NO and H2S. In
      order to show that indeed this was the case in vivo, blood was
      collected from vehicle-, ASA-, and NOSH-1-treated animals at the
      end of the carrageenan-induced edema studies. Figure 5 shows that
      indeed both NO and H2S were dose-dependently significantly higher
      in NOSH-1-treated animals.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 5. NO and H2S levels in
        vivo after NOSH-1 administration.</span> <br>
      The plasma concentration of NOx and H2S was quantified as detailed
      in the Supporting Information. Results are mean ± SEM of four rats
      in each group. *P &lt; 0.001 versus vehicle and ASA-treated
      animals.<br>
      <br>
      In the present study, we described the synthesis of four compounds
      designed to release both NO and H2S. These NOSH compounds used
      aspirin as a scaffold and were shown to inhibit the growth of
      several cancer cell lines arising from a variety of tissue types
      such as colon, breast, pancreas, lung, prostrate, and T cell
      leukemia. The compounds described here are the first to show IC50
      values for cell growth inhibition that are in the nanomolar range
      and yet are devoid of any cellular toxicity. These NOSH compounds
      were more potent than ASA, with enhanced potency ranging from at
      least 650 to greater than 100,000-fold. Of the four NOSH compounds
      evaluated here, NOSH-1 was consistently the most potent in all
      cell lines tested, and in some cases this enhancement was in
      excess of 150-fold over the others. Our data indicate that the
      effect of these NOSH compounds may be tissue-type independent
      since the NOSH-1–4 were effective against adenomatous, epithelial,
      and lymphocytic cancer cell lines. Here we studied eleven cell
      lines originating from six different tissues; therefore, it may be
      envisaged that our findings are part of a generalized effect,
      especially since all cell types responded, although in a
      differential manner. NOSH-1 also showed strong anti-inflammatory
      properties that were comparable to that of ASA, as demonstrated by
      measuring the in vivo carrageenan-induced rat paw edema, and
      direct measurement of cyclooxygenase-dependent production of PGE2.<br>
      <br>
      We are currently studying the molecular targets of these
      interesting compounds with respect to cell growth inhibition and
      are evaluating them in various animal models of cancer. Some on
      the non-Cox targets being investigated include NF-?B, reactive
      oxygen species, the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, and Wnt
      signaling.<br>

      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are prototypical
      anti-cancer agents. However, their long-term use is associated
      with adverse gastrointestinal effects. Recognition that endogenous
      gaseous mediators, nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
      can increase mucosal defense mechanisms has led to the development
      of NO- and H2S-releasing NSAIDs with increased safety profiles.
      Here we report on a new hybrid, NOSH–aspirin, which is an NO- and
      H2S-releasing agent. NOSH–aspirin inhibited HT-29 colon cancer
      growth with IC50s of 45.5 ± 2.5, 19.7 ± 3.3, and 7.7 ± 2.2 nM at
      24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. This is the first NSAID based
      agent with such high degree of potency. NOSH–aspirin inhibited
      cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused G0/G1 cell cycle
      block. Reconstitution and structure–activity studies representing
      a fairly close approximation to the intact molecule showed that
      NOSH–aspirin was 9000-fold more potent than the sum of its parts
      towards growth inhibition. NOSH–aspirin inhibited ovine COX-1 more
      than ovine COX-2. NOSH–ASA treatment of mice bearing a human colon
      cancer xenograft caused a reduction in volume of 85%. Taken
      together, these results demonstrate that NOSH–aspirin has strong
      anti-cancer potential and merits further evaluation.<br>

      NOSH–aspirin is the first dual acting NO and H2S releasing hybrid.
      ? Its IC50 for cell growth inhibition is in the low nano-molar
      range. ? Structure–activity studies show that the sum of the parts
      does not equal the whole. ? NOSH–aspirin reduced tumor growth by
      85% in mice bearing a colon cancer xenograft.<br>
