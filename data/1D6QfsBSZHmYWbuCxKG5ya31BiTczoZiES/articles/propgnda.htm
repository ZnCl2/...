      <p><a name="intro"></a><b>I. Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p>Propaganda is a subject of great concern in our society today,
        perhaps more so than in any other society in history. With the
        advent of television as a complement to the other communications
        media now available to us, the opportunities to use propaganda
        in disseminating information, expounding ideas, and offering
        opinions have increased considerably. And, unfortunately, it is
        far too often the case that propaganda is used to make us accept
        questionable points-of-view, to make us vote for men who may be
        unfit for public office, and make us buy products which are
        useless and sometimes even dangerous. Therefore, propaganda, or
        the method of influencing people to believe certain ideas and to
        follow certain courses of action, is of special importance to
        each of us. </p>
      <p>The word "propaganda" comes from the Latin phrase "Congregatio
        de Propaganda Fide", or "Congregation for the Propagation of the
        Faith", a committee formed early in the Roman Catholic Church,
        whose function it is to aid the propagation or spread of the
        church doctrine throughout the world. Propaganda plays a
        dynamic, positive role in the daily lives of many men. Actors,
        preachers, teachers, politicians, editors, advertisers,
        salesmen, reformers, authors, parents --- our friends and even
        ourselves --- practice the art of persuasion. And each of us, as
        we attempt to put our ideas across to others, to persuade them
        to agree with our way of thinking, is, in a sense, acting in the
        ancient Roman tradition of the word: we are all missionaries for
        our causes. </p>
      <p>Propaganda, as we know it today, can be nefarious as well as a
        noble art. For at one moment its techniques can be used to whip
        up racial hatred among groups of people; at another moment, its
        methods can be employed to move persons to acts of warmth and
        kindness. It is important, therefore, that we consider a
        person’s motive for using a propaganda technique, as well as
        understanding that a technique has been used. </p>
      <p>Often, the ideas of facts that we wish to convey are linked
        with words about which everyone has some emotional feeling ---
        words such as "mother", "home", "beauty", "love", or "cruelty",
        "murder" or "death" --- since both hostile and loving emotions
        are a part of us all. But just as there is a place for emotional
        feeling in men, so also there is a place for more dispassionate
        thinking. In a democratic society, it is the role for every
        citizen to make decisions after evaluating many ideas. It is
        especially important then that a citizen be able to think
        clearly about the ideas that are daily presented to him. It is
        imperative that he be able to analyze and distinguish between
        the emotional aura surrounding the ideas, and the actual content
        of the idea. To this goal of clear thinking the game of
        PROPAGANDA addresses itself. </p>
      <p>PROPAGANDA has been designed to introduce the players to some
        of the techniques used to distort the thinking process. However,
        one should not be deceived into thinking that familiarity with
        the subject matter in this game qualifies him as an expert
        thinker. PROPAGANDA should be regarded as an introduction to,
        rather than a completed course in, clear thinking. </p>
      <p>A number of cautions need to be observed as one gains a better
        understanding of propaganda techniques. Many times defects in
        argument occur innocently. This is particularly true in
        discussions involving families, associates, and/or close
        friends. Although it is hoped that your awareness of the
        principles and practices of propaganda will be employed in your
        everyday approach to problem analysis, it is recommended that in
        you "go slow" in correcting others. No one likes to be branded
        publicly as an illogical fool. Also, just because a labeled
        technique can be attached to an argument, that argument is not
        necessarily invalid. Finally, it is not the aim of the authors
        that the PROPAGANDA GAME encourage youngsters and adults to
        become cynical and unduly suspicious of everything that is said
        and written, but rather that they become aware of the emotional
        overtones in all arguments and suggestions, and thus gain more
        thoughtful control over their responses to the multitude of
        ideas that they encounter daily... </p>
      <p><b>II. Instructions ~ [Not included here]</b> </p>
      <p><b>III. Explanation of Techniques ~</b> </p>
      <p><a name="a"></a><b>Section A: Habits of Reflective
          Procedure&nbsp; (Techniques of Self-Deception)</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Prejudice ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Nathanael asked (referring to Jesus): "Can
        anything good come out of Nazareth?", and thus indicated his
        prejudice against Jesus’ hometown. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A prejudice is an unwillingness to examine
        fairly the evidence and reasoning in behalf of the person or
        thing which is the object of the prejudice. It is a prejudgment
        caused by indoctrination, conditioning, or some prior experience
        of a singularly pleasant or unpleasant character. A prejudice
        has strong and deep emotional support. </p>
      <p>In discussing Prejudice here we are not talking of <i>appeals</i>
        to known prejudices. These are made from without, as by an
        advertising man, a salesman, or a politician. Rather, our
        interest is in how your own Prejudice, unaided by outside
        support, victimizes you. </p>
      <p>Prejudice differs from hasty Generalization in that although
        hasty Generalization often represents a spontaneous emotional
        reaction, Prejudice is always a matter of <i>much longer
          standing</i>. The feeling that operates in the latter case is
        deep, not superficial, and is often completely hidden from the
        man in its grip. </p>
      <p><b>2. Academic Detachment ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "I’ve heard many arguments in favor of the
        Republican candidate and just as many for the Democratic. Hence
        I don’t find any reason to prefer one over the other, so I’m
        going to stay home and not vote for either one". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: We refuse to commit ourselves when decision or
        action is demanded. In a situation requiring a stand to be
        taken, we see (or think we see) persuasive arguments on both
        sides. But certain situations (e.g., voting) require decision
        and action of one kind or another. Here, instead of trying to
        remain neutral, we must make a decision on the basis of which
        side seems to have the greater weight of evidence. </p>
      <p><b>3. Drawing the Line ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Either you tell the truth or you lie". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Sharp distinctions are drawn where it is
        inappropriate to draw sharp distinctions. </p>
      <p>It is permissible to draw the line between those who are for
        you and those who are <i>not for you</i>, those who tell the
        truth and those who <i>do not tell the truth</i>, and so on.
        But the error and inclination exhibited by common speech is to
        fail to realize that the logical class of those who do not tell
        the truth includes <i>two</i> subclasses that are quite
        different: (1) those who lie and (2) those who say nothing at
        all. </p>
      <p><b>4. Not Drawing The Line ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "If we are allowed to stay out till two o’clock
        in the morning, why not till three --- one hour doesn’t make
        that much difference". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The existence of differences is denied just
        because the differences are small and therefore apparently
        unimportant. </p>
      <p><b>5. Conservatism, Radicalism, Moderatism ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: (1) "This belief is an old one, but I want you
        to know that the old ways are the best ways". </p>
      <p>(2) "What we need is new ideas, completely new ways of
        thinking; the old is not worthy of our acceptance". </p>
      <p>(3) "Vote for me. My program is neither conservative nor
        radical". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: These three habits of mind are forms of
        prejudice. But they are not necessarily such. Prejudices have
        histories with a beginning. But the neo-conservative, the one
        who prefers what is old or familiar simply because it is old or
        familiar, may be born such; it is part of the temperament he
        brings into the world. Radicalism is the habit of preferring the
        new or the revolutionary just because of its newness. The
        moderate habitually chooses middle-of-the-road or compromise
        ground; he avoids the two extremes. But there is no inherent
        virtue in moderatism or compromise as such. Actually, there are
        times when our position should be conservative, and still other
        times when we should be moderate. </p>
      <p><b>6. Rationalization ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: The student, having failed the test, blames his
        failure on the classroom’s being so hot that he couldn’t think,
        whereas in reality he knows that he didn’t spend enough time in
        study. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: You cite reasons or causes that will justify
        action that really has less creditable grounds. </p>
      <p><b>7. Wishful Thinking ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "My son will win because he ought to win after
        all his long hard preparation". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: You believe a proposition to be true because
        you want it to be true. </p>
      <p><i>When</i> we are forced to admit that our wishes have not
        become reality, we may then seek comfort in <i>rationalizing</i>.
        If, in the example cited above, the son does not win and the
        contest is fair, the parent will feel the necessity of inventing
        some argument that will excuse the son’s failure. </p>
      <p><b>8. Tabloid Thinking ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "In college Basil was taught all about
        evolution --- the apeman theory, you know". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: To think in tabloids is to oversimplify a
        complex theory or set of circumstances. The tabloid thinker
        prefers quick summaries and has the habit of "putting things in
        a nutshell". </p>
      <p>Tabloids concerning people are popular because they offer a
        neat summary of the character of a prominent person. "Marx? You
        don’t know who Marx was? Why, he was that philosopher who became
        impatient and irritable in his old age". It is much easier to
        remember Marx in this simple fashion than to remember him as a
        man of many interesting and controversial facets of character
        and conviction. These human tabloids are frequently emotional,
        but they are not mere Emotional Terms. To be Tabloid Thinking
        there must be some indication that someone is trying to sum up
        another’s character. All stereotypes ("barbers are talkative")
        are tabloids because they present a certain trait or
        characteristic, which is really superficial or trivial, as being
        the essential nature of a given class. </p>
      <p><b>9. Causal Oversimplification ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "If it were not for the ammunition makers, we
        would never have wars". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A complex event is explained by references to
        only one or two probable causes whereas <i>many</i> are
        responsible. </p>
      <p><b>10. Inconceivability ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Since Ballhead State has never in its past
        history won the conference title, I just can’t picture them
        winning it this year". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: You declare a proposition to be false simply
        because you cannot conceive it actualized or possible of
        realization. </p>
      <p><a name="b"></a><b>Section B: Watch Their Language --- And
          Yours Too (Techniques of Language)</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Emotional Terms ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Participant in Argument: "If you ignorant fools
        would only shut your traps a while and let me explain". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An emotional term is a word or phrase&nbsp;
        which, however much factual information it conveys about an
        object, also expresses and/or arouses a feeling <i>for</i> or <i>against</i>
        that object. Translated into neutral language the
        emotionally-charged example given above should read: "I don’t
        agree and if you’ll just give me a chance to talk, I’ll show you
        why". </p>
      <p>The authors believe that emotional language is appropriate in
        non-controversial situations. For purposes of the Propaganda
        game, <i>patriotic celebrations, church services, poetry and
          other literary forms</i>, and whenever a person is expressing
        <i>personal feelings without attempting to persuade or convince
          others</i> are considered to be non-controversial situations.
      </p>
      <p><b>2. Metaphor &amp; Simile ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Metaphor --- "Napoleon was like a fox". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A <i>metaphor</i> is a comparison implied but
        not definitely stated. In the case of <i>simile</i> the
        comparison is explicitly stated by means of such words as "like"
        or "as". </p>
      <p>In controversial situations the employment of metaphor or
        simile is to be avoided because such figures of speech are apt
        to suggest likenesses not really intended or not actually
        present. Napoleon was not actually a fox. He may have been like
        one, but if so, was it with respect to shrewdness or thievery or
        both or neither? </p>
      <p><b>3. Emphasis ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: When "We should not speak ill of our friends"
        is quoted, the original meaning changes if any of the following
        underlined words is emphasized: "<i>We should</i> not <i>speak</i>
        ill of <i>our</i> friends". Emphasizing "we" suggests that we
        should not, true, <i>but others may</i>. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The technique of emphasis occurs only when
        another speaker or writer is quoted and one or more words
        emphasized so as to imply what would not otherwise be implied
        and thus put into the mouth of the source, meanings he may not
        have wished to convey. </p>
      <p>Oral emphasis is usually secured by means of pitch, tone, or
        volume of voice. Written emphasis is secured by a variety of
        devices, such as italicizing and underlining. "Italics mine" (or
        its equivalent) is the accepted way for a writer to indicate
        that he is giving a stress to certain words that the original
        author had perhaps no intention of stressing. </p>
      <p><b>4. Quotation Out of Context ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Someone quotes the Bible as saying that, "money
        is the root of all evil", but leave out the preceding words,
        "the love of". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Quotation out of context is a propaganda
        technique wheb the effect of quoting a given statement without
        its context is to distort the original meaning in context. </p>
      <p>The context of a given statement is not merely the words that
        precede and that follow but every accompanying circumstance,
        whether it be time and place or gesture and facial expression. </p>
      <p><b>5. Abstract Terms ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: A speaker defines "neurosis" as "a
        psychological term for a state of mind involving the nerves",
        but when he is asked to identify or point to --- among a large
        number of people --- a case of neurosis, he is at a loss to do
        so, showing that he is unable to use the term to make any
        concrete distinctions. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An abstract term is a word or symbol which
        stands for the qualities (one or more) possessed in common by a
        number of particular things, facts or events. The technique of
        abstract terms occurs when an arguer employs a word for which he
        may have meaning in the form of other words, <i>but the arguer
          is unable to identify the concrete facts to which to word
          supposedly refers</i>. </p>
      <p><b>6. Vagueness ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Someone says to me, "Sit down on that stool",
        and I sit down on the thing he points to. His meaning is not
        ambiguous; I understand what he is referring to. But I find the
        term "stool" vague under the circumstances, and I protest, "But
        this is not a stool, for it has a little back to it, and so it
        is a chair". He may reply, "But there is really not enough back
        there to call it a ‘back’, so I call it a ‘stool’". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: To call a word "vague" is to say that marginal
        situations can and do arise where there is doubt as to whether
        the word should or should not be used in describing those
        particular situations. The technique of vagueness exists where
        there is uncertainty as to the <i>scope</i> of the word. </p>
      <p><b>7. Ambiguity ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Joe says, "Henry likes pudding better than his
        wife". And one or more people hearing him are left wondering
        whether Henry likes pudding better than he likes his wife if
        Henry likes pudding more than his wife does. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A word or phrase is ambiguous if in the mind of
        a hearer or reader it has two or more quite different meanings
        and the interpreter is uncertain as to which was really meant.
        In argument such a situation would at all times be undesirable.
      </p>
      <p><b>8. Shift of Meaning ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "The fellow who was supposed to arbitrate
        decided in favor of a company and fined the union. Now anyone
        who takes sides in a dispute is certainly not impartial. So how
        can this fellow claim to be an impartial arbitrator?". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: In shift of meaning a word appears explicitly
        or implicitly two or more times in an argument but with
        different meanings. </p>
      <p>In the example appearing above "impartial" shifts meaning. In
        its first use it means "wholly refraining from judgment; taking
        no stand on an issue". But in its second use it means "judging
        after investigation but without previous bias". Obviously, the
        arbitrator’s being impartial in the second sense does not
        necessitate his being so in the first sense. The implied
        conclusion ("the arbitrator is not impartial") is invalid. </p>
      <p><a name="c"></a><b>Section C: How Suggestible Are You?
          (Techniques of Irrelevance)</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Appearance ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: A floor wax nationally advertised on television
        is shown in the commercial being applied to a floor with the
        immediate result of a brilliant luster. The viewer does not know
        that the floor has been buffed and polished for days, and then
        dust coated just before the wax was applied in the commercial. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The appearance of a thing (or person) is made
        the basis of our acceptance or rejection without any thought
        that this appearance may be a deceptive indicator of value. </p>
      <p><b>2. Manner ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "He was such a well-behaved man, so
        understanding, so sincerely helpful. He wanted to help us. I
        couldn’t insult him. So I gave him our savings to invest. He
        seemed so trustworthy". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A person’s manner of behaving is made the basis
        of our acceptance or rejection of him without any thought that
        this manner may be a deceptive indicator of value. </p>
      <p><b>3. Degrees &amp; Titles ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: The name on the office door reads "James A.
        Rydack, The. B, M. Th. R., As. D., Counselor Extraordinary of
        the Society of Metaphysicians". A woman about to enter the
        office says to her husband, "With all those degrees and that
        title, he must know his stuff". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: We buy or we believe out of respect for degrees
        or titles attached to the names of those who persuade us. </p>
      <p><b>4. Numbers ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: From an advertisement: "One million <i>more</i>
        sold this year than last". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: We buy or believe because of the large numbers
        associated with the product or proposition. </p>
      <p><b>5. Status ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Advertisement appearing in the <i>Hampshire
          Gazette</i>, January 29, 1970: "President Washington, when he
        addressed the two houses of Congress on the 8th instance, was
        dressed in a crow-colored suit of American manufacture. This
        elegant fabric was made from the manufactory in Hartford". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Persons or objects for which we have a strong
        sentiment of respect or esteem -- or which at least possess some
        degree of fame or prestige -- are introduced into the argument
        as endorsing that which we are asked to buy or believe. </p>
      <p><b>6. Repetition ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Radio commercial: "Get up with GET-UP, GET-UP’s
        got get up. Got it? Get it? Get GET-UP!". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: We buy or believe because we have heard or seen
        the idea or product name so often. </p>
      <p><b>7. Slogans ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Wheatless, the breakfast of champions";
        "LSMFT" (Lusty Strife means Fine Tobacco); "When better cars are
        built, Bluink will build them"; "Better buy Bards-Eye". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A slogan is a short, meaningful, catchy phrase
        or sentence intended for general consumption and designed to
        terminate thought and promote action in favor of the slogan
        maker. However true the slogan may be, if your action is merely
        a favorable response to the slogan, the technique is successful.
      </p>
      <p><b>8. Technical Jargon ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Advertisement: "Liberty Rubber’s new tires
        contain Durium, the bonding material that makes these tires wear
        for years". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The technique of technical jargon is the use of
        technical language or unfamiliar words, whether contained in the
        dictionary or freshly coined, for the purpose of impressing
        people. </p>
      <p><b>9. Sophistical Formula ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: <i>Mrs Jones</i>: "You know, Ann, I think the
        Browns must be having trouble. The last two mornings I’ve seen
        Tom Brown leave the house, slam the door, and drive off in his
        car looking awfully mad. I’ll bet they’re headed for a divorce".
      </p>
      <p><i>Mrs Smith</i>: "I don’t know, Barbara. Rally, they’ve always
        seemed to be very much in love". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: To shut off or close the argument a popular
        maxim or old saying is quoted. But every controversial situation
        must be settled in its own terms, and not on the merits (if any)
        of some proverb. </p>
      <p><a name="d"></a><b>Section D: What’s Your Weakness? (Techniques
          of Exploitation)</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Appeal to Pity ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Student to professor: "I know that my test
        grades have been poor and that I deserve an F, but my father is
        in the hospital and it will just break his heart if I get an F
        in this course". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An attempt is made to secure our commitment by
        presenting the object of commitment as an object of sympathy,
        thereby arousing our sympathetic feelings to the point where
        these feelings determine favorable action. </p>
      <p><b>2. Appeal to Flattery ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Salesman to young matron answering the door:
        "Is your mother home?". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An attempt is made to persuade us to buy or
        believe by flattering us on our personal appearance or in some
        other category where we excel or desire to excel. </p>
      <p><b>3. Appeal to Ridicule ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: The sergeant, on the first day of class, having
        made a certain statement is asked an embarrassing question by a
        member of the class. Preferring a cheap victory to an honest
        discussion, the sergeant replies sarcastically, "I am afraid,
        Private Jones, that I cannot understand what you mean. You are
        too deep for me". He then goes on to the next questioner. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An attempt is made to influence us to accept a
        certain proposition by poking fun at those who oppose the
        proposition. </p>
      <p><b>4. Appeal to Prestige ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Real estate advertisement: "Live in exclusive
        Broadmoor Terraces, where successful people live. Deluxe
        executive apartments furnished in the Continental manner". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An attempt is made to induce you to buy or
        believe by stating or suggesting that such action will secure or
        maintain prestige for you. </p>
      <p>Status and Appeal to Prestige, though related techniques,
        nevertheless represent quite different errors. In the former
        case it is suggested that if Jones, a person possessing or
        allegedly possessing status, buys or believes, so should you.
        There is <i>no</i> implication that your buying or believeing
        will confer on you equivalent status. The Appeal to Prestige
        suggests that you should buy or believe because by so doing <i>you</i>
        will acquire or improve status. </p>
      <p><b>5. Appeal to Prejudice ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: A young man, wishing to make a good impression
        on his girl friend’s father, learns that he is a rabid Democrat.
        So one evening, while waiting for the daughter to finish
        dressing, he engages the father in conversation, and the young
        man turns the conversation to the point where he can rip to
        Republicans to pieces. The father later informs the girl that
        the young man has "good stuff in him and should go a long way".
      </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The one who makes the appeal to prejudice
        attempts to persuade you to act or feel in a certain way by
        associating his person, product or proposal with a certain one
        or more of your prejudices, positive or negative --- a prejudice
        being a prejudgment wrapped in emotion and having a history. Not
        only does he rekindle your prejudice, he also arouses in you
        warm feelings toward the one (himself) who apparently shares
        your prejudice. And so it becomes much easier to make you
        believe or buy what ever he has to offer. </p>
      <p><b>6. Bargain Appeal ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: The supermarket has a special display at the
        front of the store: canned peaches by the case (8 cans) for
        "only $3.20". Checking the shelves where single cans of peaches
        may be purchased, one finds the same brand priced at 40 cents
        per can. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An attempt is made to get you to buy by
        appealing to your desire to save money. If you buy without
        making you own comparison as to price, quality, and service, the
        technique is successful. </p>
      <p><b>7. Folksy Appeal ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: The salesman who on meeting the prospect for
        the second (or even the first) time slaps him on the back as if
        he were a long lost brother and addresses him by his nickname. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The user of this device places himself or his
        product on a level of neighborly intimacy with the reader or
        listener. </p>
      <p><b>8. Join the Bandwagon Appeal ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Vote for a winner, Senator Simpkins". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An effort is made to influence you to act in a
        certain way by asserting or implying that that is what is
        popular or what is the majority is doing. </p>
      <p><b>9. Appeal to Practical Consequences ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Slip inserted in workers’ pay envelopes: "If
        the Republicans do not win this election, this factory will be
        forced to close its doors and you will be without a job". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: An effort is made to persuade us to buy or
        believe by appealing to our concern for our own individual
        welfare, i.e., if we do as we are asked, we will secure certain
        beneficial consequences, while if we refuse to do as asked, the
        consequences will be harmful. </p>
      <p><b>10. Passing from the Acceptable to the Dubious ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Advertisement: "The boys in the service abroad
        want letters more than gifts. Write frequently because some
        letters may be lost. Write only good news because there are
        enough unpleasant things going on over there. Buy and write on
        Barton’s Victory Stationery". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The arguer states a series of propositions. The
        early ones are readily acceptable to the audience or reader, but
        the concluding statement may be dubious. The listener or reader
        is expected to accept blindly the later ones because he has
        accepted those which came before. </p>
      <p><a name="e"></a><b>Section E: The Fault May Be With The Form
          (Techniques of Form)</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Concurrency ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Who was president at the time of World War I?
        Wilson, a Democrat. Who was President at the time of World War
        II? Roosevelt, a Democrat. Who was President at the time of the
        Korean War? Truman, a Democrat. Obviously, the Democratic party
        is the war party". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Because things exist or appear simultaneously,
        it is claimed that one is the cause of the other. The form of
        the argument is: A is present along with B; therefore A is the
        cause of B. But two concurrents could never be the cause of one
        another, for a cause is something <i>antecedent</i> in time. </p>
      <p><b>2. Post Hoc ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "The bankers are the source of our troubles.
        You will notice that every depression is preceded by bank
        failures". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Because two events (or things) follow one
        another in close temporal succession the first event is claimed
        to be the cause of the second. The form of the argument is: A
        precedes B; therefore A is the cause of B. We may take as a
        hypothesis for testing, that A is a (or the) cause of B, but we
        should not forget that any one of a score of other preceding
        events is equally worthy of consideration. </p>
      <p><b>3. Selected Instances ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Someone says, "All professors are conceited".
        When asked for his evidence he replies, "Well, how about
        Professor Smith, Professor Jones, and Professor Brown. Everybody
        knows they’re as conceited as they come". But he deliberately
        skips over Professor Black whom he knows to be a model of
        humility. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Support is drawn for a position by choosing
        only those cases or instances which can back it up and
        disregarding those cases or instances which either contradict or
        do not support the position. The form of the argument is: All A
        is B; because A1, A2, A3 and A4 are B. the form is invalid; the
        arguer knows that at least A5 is not B. </p>
      <p><b>4. Hasty Generalizations ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Having observed five women to be poor drivers,
        Jones generalizes and declares all women are poor drivers. </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The arguer jumps to a general or blanket
        conclusion about members of a given group on the basis of an
        unrepresentative or insufficient number of cases. The form of
        the argument is: A1, A2, A3 are B; therefore all A is B. </p>
      <p>Selected Instances and Hasty Generalization have much the same
        effect. There are important differences, however. Hasty
        Generalization typically occurs on an emotional basis, while
        selected instances is typically coldly calculating. In the
        former case there is, at the time at least, no awareness of
        opposed instances; in the latter case, there is. Selected
        Instances is not merely crooked thinking but dishonesty. On the
        surface the two are apt to look alike, and until we have
        evidence that the arguer is really deliberately closing his eyes
        to contradictory cases, we cannot label the technique as
        Selected Instances. </p>
      <p><b>5. Faulty Analogy ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Last quarter I had a student by the name of
        Orzymski who did good work. This quarter I have another student
        by that name, and I’m expecting good work from him". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: To reason analogically is to reason that
        because two of more things or types of things are alike in some
        one or more respects (we may call this the antecedent
        resemblance), they will therefore be found alike in some other
        respect(s) --- the consequent resemblance. In cases of reliable
        analogies the antecedent factor is already known to have some
        bearing on the consequent factor. In faulty analogies such
        knowledge is lacking. The form of the argument is: A is like B
        in respect c; therefore A is like B in respect d. </p>
      <p>In our example, while it is true that Orzymski is a rare name
        in English-speaking societies and while it is even probable that
        a second Orzymski enrolled at the same college would be related
        to the first, we need evidence that heredity is a decisive
        factor in scholastic performance. But an analogy is no stronger
        than its linking generalization, which in this case is "Heredity
        determines scholastic performance". Since our experience
        contains an abundance of cases of relatives with widely
        different scholastic records, we can have no confidence in an
        analogy based on such a linking generalization. </p>
      <p>Some arguments take the form of alleging a complete analogy:
        two things are alike to the point of identity. The argument is:
        A (or all A) is c and B (or all B) is c; therefore B is A (or A
        is B). "Communists will not take the oath of allegiance and
        neither will Jones. Therefore he must be a Communist". The
        absurdity of this argument becomes readily evident when we see
        it is just like saying, "Dogs have tails; this cat has a tail;
        so this cat is a dog". </p>
      <p>In discussing Metaphor and Simile the point was made that
        neither one, especially Metaphor, should be used in
        controversial situations. That remains true. But a metaphor or
        simile appearing by itself is to an argument, and is very
        uncertain in meaning. Analogies make use of simile and make
        clear how A is compared to B, but it still must be said that
        analogical argument is strong only when A and B are essentially
        the same thing, and A has a property deriving from its essential
        nature, therefore B must have the same property. </p>
      <p><b>6. Composition ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "He’s a nice boy; she’s a nice girl. I’m sure
        they’ll make a nice married couple". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: We reason as if the properties of elements or
        individuals were always (i.e., necessarily) the properties of
        the wholes which they constitute. But the assumption that what
        holds true of a part is automatically true of the whole cannot
        be justified. The form of the argument is: A is part of B and A
        is c; therefore B is c. </p>
      <p><b>7. Division ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "How dare you criticize any member of the
        Harvard faculty? Don’t you know that this faculty has the
        highest reputation of any university faculty in the United
        States?". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: We reason as if the properties of any whole are
        always (i.e., necessarily) properties of each part. But the
        assumption that what holds true of a whole is automatically true
        of its parts cannot be justified. The form of the argument is: A
        is part of B and B is c; therefore A is c. </p>
      <p><b>8. Non Sequitur ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Your children deserve the best milk. Buy
        Lorden’s". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The conclusion is not necessitated by the
        premise(s). </p>
      <p>Strictly speaking, <i>all</i> the techniques so far covered
        where the conclusion is invalid are <i>Non Sequiturs</i>. There
        is, therefore, no one form for a Non Sequitur. In the example
        cited above no more reason is given to buy Lorden’s milk than to
        buy Healtest or any one of a hundred other brands of milk. </p>
      <p><i>Since the Non Sequitur label can be applied to so many other
          techniques, the label will be reserved on for those
          invalidities that cannot be classified under some other
          heading. They are, at least, Non Sequiturs</i>. </p>

        should be run on a profit-sharing basis". <br>
        <i>Smith</i>: "Really! I don’t think so. I don’t see any

        employees". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "Profit-sharing will provide the worker with
        greater incentive". <br>
        <i>Smith</i>: "Workers don’t need more incentive. They need
        higher wages. I remember the wages I got as a boy, working in
        the bean fields. They were pitifully low". <br>

        <i>Smith</i>: "No, Jones, I beg to differ. You were the best
        picker". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: To divert is to get off the subject. With the
        original issue left unresolved, one of the disputants begins to
        talk of something which has no apparent evidential value for his
        thesis. The diversion is full (instead of merely partial) when
        the second party to the argument "accepts the diversion and
        joins in discussion or argument over the new issue. </p>
      <p><b>2. Disproving a Minor Point ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: <i>Jones</i>: I believe that the installment
        system of buying has been a boon to America, since (1) it has
        enable the ordinary man to have what has hitherto been only a
        luxury for the well-to-do; (2) it has raised the standard of
        living; (3) it has provided employment for many clerks, typists,
        etc., who must keep installment accounts". <br>
        <i>Smith</i>: "After all, the head of a gang of thieves provides
        gainful employment, and so any defense of installment buying on
        the grounds of its providing employment is silly and evades the
        question as whether this kind of employment is desirable.
        Therefore, I don’t see that you have presented any substantial
        reason for favoring installment buying". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: When you have, say, two or more pieces of
        evidence of varying degrees of importance, your opponent takes
        on of the less weighty of your arguments (perhaps a rather
        trivial point) and discredits that. He then acts as if (or
        attempts to create the impression that) he has disproved your
        whole case. </p>
      <p><b>3. Ad Hominem ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: <i>Smith</i>: "This town needs more efficient
        and vigorous police protection. Some on the police force should
        be retired and some should be fired". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "Absolutely not. And who are you to talk about
        improving our police protection? As I recall, 30 years ago you
        did time for forgery". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Instead of attacking your proposition, your
        opponent directs his argument against you as a person. Although
        a person’s past record is something one should take into
        consideration, it should not be one’s sole basis for judging an
        argument. </p>
      <p>The Ad Hominem attack often takes the form of discounting a
        proposition by attributing prejudice or bias to its supporters.
        But what motivates is to believe as we do, say what we say, is
        one thing. The truth or falsity, validity or invalidity, of what
        we say is another. It is possible to be prejudiced but right. </p>
      <p>Another form of Ad Hominem is charging your opponent with the
        inconsistency of not living up to what he advocates. </p>
      <p><b>4. Appeal to Ignorance ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "I know that man’s soul is immortal. Why?
        Because you can’t prove that it isn’t". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A proposition (1) is said to be true because it
        has not been disproved or (2) is said to be untrue because it
        has not been proved. </p>
      <p>What is not disproved on a given occasion is not necessarily
        true. Is a scientific theory accepted as true because you cannot
        disprove it? Rather, the theory must be verified positively
        Every person who presents a proposition in argument has the
        obligation to offer at least one reason in defense of it. </p>
      <p>Likewise, your opponent’s successful attack on all premises or
        reasons you advance does not in all strictness make his position
        right or yours wrong. All he has shown is that your position is
        not true for your reasons. Other people, now or later, may be
        able to produce better reasons. Similarly, your being able to
        show that your adversary in his defense has involved himself in
        contradiction is not sufficient to prove him wrong. Smith may be
        arguing that the taking of life is evil, but admits that he
        doesn’t object to killing animals for food. There is a
        contradiction and confusion, but Smith may still be right that
        the taking of life is evil. </p>
      <p><b>5. Leading Question ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: (1) "It was early in the morning, wasn’t it?".
      </p>
      <p>(2) "Since when have you stopped drinking?" </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A leading question is one which (1) dictates or
        suggests an answer or (2) one which incriminates the answerer
        (or places him in an undesirable position) no matter how he
        answers. In the first example the answer "Yes" is natural and is
        apt to be forthcoming, especially if the person to whom the
        question is addressed is highly suggestible and/or half awake.
        In the second example an answer in a form appropriate to the
        question ("Since Tuesday") would still be an admission that one
        did drink. </p>
      <p>Under the second form of Leading Question may be included any
        question which assumes as true that which is yet controversial
        and undecided. "Why is it that labor leaders are so much less
        concerned about the general welfare than are the leaders of
        business?". The one to whom the question is addressed tends to
        ask himself, "Now why is that?", when he ought to immediately
        respond, "Wait a minute! Let’s settle first whether it is true
        that they are less concerned". </p>
      <p><b>6. Complex Question ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: "Do you deny that you were in the room at the
        time of the murder? Do you deny that you have always hated the
        man? Do you deny that if you couldn’t have killed him yourself
        you would have been glad to have someone else do the dirty job?
        Answer me, ‘yes’ or ‘no’". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A series of questions are put and then the
        questioner demands that they be answered as a whole by either
        "yes" or "no". Since there is always the possibility that the
        answerer needs to answer each of the questions separately and
        differently, the complex question puts the answerer in an unfair
        position. </p>
      <p>Although the questions contained in the series may each be a
        leading question, the complex question differs in that separate
        answers are not desired. </p>
      <p><b>7. Inconsequent Argument ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: <i>Prosecuting Attorney</i>: "The defendant is
        charged with assault and attempted robbery. There can be no
        doubt of this man’s guilt. In the past ten years he has been
        convicted 13 times on different charges of forgery, theft, and
        rape. (The prosecutor then goes into each of these cases in
        detail, He passes to the jurors documents that support what he
        has said about the defendant’s record) the sickening record that
        I have exhibited speaks for itself. Gentlemen, I ask for a
        verdict of ‘guilty’". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: The arguer proves or establishes something, but
        not what he said he would prove. </p>
      <p>In the example given above, surely proof of a previous bad
        record is a far cry from proof of guilt in the offenses charged.
        Proof of a bad record is "inconsequential" --- of no
        consequence. If bad record proves guilt, then for every crime
        there are millions of guilty people. </p>
      <p>Inconsequent Argument differs from Diversion is that in the
        latter nothing is proved, whereas in the former something has
        been proven, though not what the arguer was expected to prove. </p>
      <p><b>8. Attacking a Straw Man ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: (1) <i>Smith</i>: "I am opposed to capital
        punishment". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "I’m not". <br>
        <i>Smith</i>: "You ought to be. Capital punishment is
        unchristian". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "People like you who oppose punishing criminals
        nauseate me". </p>
      <p>(2) <i>Smith</i>: "I am opposed to capital punishment". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "You fellows that are against capital punishment
        must want your daughters molested every time they leave the
        house!". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: Your opponent either (1) restates your position
        falsely or (2) exaggerates the consequences that may follow from
        your position. </p>
      <p><b>9. Victory by Definition ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>:<i> Jones</i>: "Communism cannot help but work".
        <br>
        <i>Smith</i>: "I disagree. Look at Russia; things are in a mess
        there". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "Oh, sure, but that’s not real communism". <br>
        <i>Smith</i>: "Look at China; communism is not working there". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "They don’t have communism there either". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: A position is defined in such a way as to
        exclude all negative cases or adverse evidence. </p>
      <p>Evidently Jones is <i>defining</i> "communism" as "that
        political system which cannot help but work". This certainly
        does not accurately report how most people use the term. Instead
        of destroying Smith’s position by evidence, Jones leaves him no
        ground for an opposing position and so destroys the argument as
        a whole. The same effect would have been secured if Jones had
        started out saying, "True communism cannot help but work". </p>
      <p><b>10. Begging the Question ~</b> </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: (1) "Man is a social animal because he is
        gregarious". </p>
      <p>(2) <i>Jones</i> (at the bank): "I would like a loan". <br>
        Banker: "What recommendations of references do you have,
        something to establish that if we loan you the money, you will
        pay it back?". <br>
        <i>Jones</i>: "Well, I can refer you to my friend Quimby; he’ll
        vouch for me. He’ll tell you that when I say I’ll pay, I will".
        <br>
        <i>Banker</i>: "But we don’t know Quimby, so how do we know he
        can be trusted?". <br>
        Jones: "Oh, I can assure you that Quimby can be trusted". </p>
      <p><i>Meaning</i>: This technique involves assuming as true what
        has yet to be proved. Frequently the same proposition is used
        both as premise and as conclusion in a single argument. This may
        be done either (1) by the use of synonymous terms or (2) by
        circular argument, which involves the use of A to prove B and B
        to prove A. </p>
      <p><b>IV. The Experts Game</b> [Not included here] </p>
      <p><a name="sum"></a><b>V. Summary</b> </p>
      <p>As was pointed out in the introduction, the PROPAGANDA GAME is
        intended to be an introduction to "clear thinking", not a
        completed course of study. As a followup to the game we
        recommend Dr Moulds' book, <i>Thinking Straighter</i>. Dr
        Moulds' book includes more comprehensive treatment of the
        techniques used in the PROPAGANDA GAME with added examples, a
        chapter on <i>The External Marks of Authority</i> --- Who Says
        It? Why Does He Say It? and What Is The Medium of the Argument?
        --- and a chapter on <i>Internal Criteria of Reliability</i>
        --- Documented Evidence, Sound Generalization, Internal
        Consistency, Impartial Treatment, Valid Deduction, and Probable
        Prediction. After reading this book you should be thinking
        straighter. You should become more accurate and precise in the
        use of words and more demanding of precision on the part of
        others. You should be more careful in drawing your own
        conclusions and less ready to accept at first glance the
        conclusions of others. The book is published by the Wm. C. Brown
        Co (Dubuque, IA). </p>
      <p>In conclusion, in a free and democratic society, it is
        incumbent upon every citizen to be well informed on propaganda
        techniques. Every citizen should, therefore, play the PROPAGANDA
        GAME (We're sure you will want to label this technique). </p>

      <p>Each of these fallacies is characterized by the illegitimate
        use of a logical operator in order to distract the reader from
        the apparent falsity of a certain proposition. The following
        fallacies are fallacies of distraction: </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">False Dilemma</font></b><a name="faldilma"></a>
      </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        A limited number of options (usually two) is given, while in
        reality there are more options. A false dilemma is an
        illegitimate use of the "or" operator. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) Either you're for me or against me. <br>
        (ii) America: love it or leave it. <br>
        (iii) Either support gun confiscation or have the government
        provide everyone with his own private nuclear warhead, you
        decide which one. </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Identify the options given and show (with an example) that there
        is an additional option. </p>
      <p><i>References:</i> <br>
        Cedarblom and Paulsen: 136 </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Argument From Ignorance (argumentum ad
            ignorantiam)</font></b><a name="ignor"></a> </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        Arguments of this form assume that since something has not been
        proven false (or cannot be), it is therefore true. Conversely,
        such an argument may assume that since something has not been
        proven true, it is therefore false. (This is a special case of a
        false dilemma, since it assumes that all propositions must
        either be known to be true or known to be false.) </p>
      <p>As Davis writes, "Lack of proof is not proof." (p. 59) </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) Since you cannot prove that ghosts do not exist, therefore
        they must exist. <br>
        (ii) Since scientists have not proven that global warming will
        occur, therefore it won't. <br>
        (iii) Fred said that he is smarter than Jill, but he didn't
        prove it, so it must be false. </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Identify the proposition in question. Argue without evidence and
        proof no claims whatsoever can be derived on the subject. Such a
        claim is neither true nor false, but arbitrary. </p>
      <p><i>References:</i> <br>
        Copi and Cohen: 93; Davis: 59; Rand: 79 </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Slippery Slope</font></b><a name="slip"></a>
      </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        In order to show that a proposition is unacceptable, a sequence
        of increasingly unacceptable events is claimed to follow from
        it. A slippery slope is an illegitimate compositing of the"if-
        then" operator. Of course this ought to be distinguished from
        pointing out a chain of causal consequences from a choice or
        position. The difference is that in a slippery slope fallacy the
        intermediate causal connections are unproven. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) If we pass laws against private nuclear weapons, then it
        won't be long before we pass laws against guns, and then we will
        begin to restrict other rights, and finally we will end up
        living in a communist state. Thus, we should not ban private
        nuclear weapons. <br>
        (ii) You should never gamble. Once you start gambling you find
        it hard to stop. Soon you are spending all your money on
        gambling, and eventually you will turn to crime to support your
        earnings. <br>
        (iii) If I make an exception for you then I have to make an
        exception for everyone. </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Identify the proposition being refuted and identify the final
        event in the series of events. Then show that this final event
        need not occur as a <br>
        consequence of the proposition. </p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Complex Question</font></b><a name="complx"></a>
      </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        Two otherwise unrelated points are treated as a single
        proposition. The reader is expected to accept or reject both
        together, when in reality one may be acceptable while the other
        is not. A complex question is an illegitimate use of the "and"
        operator. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) You should support home schooling and the God-given right of
        parents to raise their children according to their own beliefs.
        (Whether parents have a right to choose how to raise their
        children and whether that right includes home schooling is an
        entirely different issue. There is an additional complex
        question here since one might believe that a certain right
        exists but not believe it comes from God.) <br>
        (ii) Do you support freedom and the right to bear arms? (What if
        I think people ought to be free to bear arms but that it isn't a
        right? What if I think it is a right, but I don't think it
        matters what rights people have?) <br>
        (iii) Have you stopped beating your wife? (This implicitly asks
        two questions: did you beat your wife, and did you stop?) </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Identify the two propositions illegitimately conjoined and show
        that one doen't imply the other. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Appeals to Motives in Place of Support</font></b><a
            name="motivsupp"></a></p>
      </center>
      <p>The fallacies in this section have in common the practice of
        appealing to emotions or other psychological factors. In this
        way, they do not provide reasons for belief, but merely "trick"
        people into agreeing with them one way or another without proof.
      </p>
      <p>The following fallacies are appeals to motive in place of
        support: </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Appeal to Force (argumentum ad baculum)</font></b><a
          name="force"></a> </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>

        not agree with the author. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) You had better agree that the new company policy is the best
        if you expect to keep your job. <br>
        (ii) You had better admit that racism is wrong or one day you
        might just find out how much you care about your wife and kids.
        <br>
        (iii) The defendant ought to be found innocent because if he
        isn't, there will be a riot and many innocent citizens will be
        hurt or killed. <br>

      <p>The fallacies in this section change the subject by discussing
        the person making the argument instead of discussing reasons to
        believe or disbelieve the conclusion. While on some occasions it
        is useful to cite authorities, it is almost never appropriate to
        discuss the person instead of the argument. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Attacking the Person (argumentum ad hominem)</font></b><a
          name="adhom"></a> </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        The person presenting an argument is attacked instead of the
        argument itself. This takes many forms. For example, the
        person's character, nationality or religion may be attacked.
        Alternatively, it may be pointed out that a person stands to
        gain from a favourable outcome. Or, finally, a person may be
        attacked by association, or by the company he keeps. </p>
      <p>There are three major forms of Attacking the Person: <br>
        Ad hominem (abusive): instead of attacking an assertion, the
        argument attacks the person who made the assertion. <br>
        Ad hominem (circumstantial): instead of attacking an assertion
        the author points to the relationship between the person making
        the assertion and the person's circumstances. <br>
        Ad hominem (tu quoque): this form of attack on the person notes
        that a person does not practise what he preaches. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) You may argue that God doesn't exist, but you are just a fat
        idiot. (ad hominem abusive) <br>
        (ii) We should discount what Steve Forbes says about cutting
        taxes because he stands to benefit from a lower tax rate. (ad
        hominem circumstantial) <br>
        (iii) We should disregard Fred's argument because he is just
        angry about the fact that defendant once cheated him out of
        $100. (ad hominem circumstantial) <br>
        (iv) You say I should give up alcohol, but you haven't been
        sober for more than a year yourself. (<i>ad hominem tu quoque</i>)
        <br>
        (v) You claim that Mr. Jones is innocent, but why should anyone
        listen to you? You are a Mormon after all. (ad hominem
        circumstantial) </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Appeal to Authority (argumentum ad
            verecundium)</font></b><a name="author"></a> </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        While sometimes it may be appropriate to cite an authority to
        support a point, often it is not. In particular, an appeal to
        authority is inappropriate if: <br>
        (i) the person is not qualified to have an expert opinion on the
        subject, <br>
        (ii) experts in the field disagree on this issue. <br>
        (iii) the authority was making a joke, drunk, under duress, or
        otherwise not being serious <br>
        (iv) There is no supporting evidence or argument to justify the
        position. If O.J. Simpson (an expert on football) insisted that
        footballs were made of cabbage leaves that wouldn't constitute
        an argument to that effect. </p>
      <p>A variation of the fallacious appeal to authority is hearsay.
        An argument from hearsay is an argument which depends on second
        or third hand sources. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) Noted psychologist Elaine Johnson recommends that you buy
        the EZ-Rest Hot Tub. (She is not an expert on hot tubs.) <br>
        (ii) Economist Alan Greenspan argues that going on the gold
        standard will lead to economic prosperity. (Although Greenspan
        is an expert, not all economists agree on this point, nor does
        his saying so make it true.) <br>
        (iii) We are headed for nuclear war. Last week Ronald Reagan
        remarked that we begin bombing Russia in five minutes. (Of
        course, he said it as a joke during a microphone test.) <br>
        (iv) My friend heard on the news the other day that The United
        States will declare war on Canada. (This is a case of hearsay;
        in fact, the reporter said that The United States would not
        declare war.) <br>
        (v) The Los Angeles Times reported that sales were up 8.1
        percent this year. (This is hearsay; we are not in a position to
        check the Times' sources.) </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Point out that either (i) the person cited is not an authority
        in the field, or that (ii) being an expert in the field doesn't
        automatically make one right and insist that the argument
        advanced be addressed without the appeal to authority. </p>

          name="anonauth"></a> </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        The authority in question is not named. This is a type of appeal
        to authority because when an authority is not named it is
        impossible to confirm that the authority is an expert or how the
        conclusion was arrived at. Though this is just a type of appeal
        to authority, the fallacy is so common it deserves special
        mention. </p>
      <p>A variation on this fallacy is the appeal to rumour. Because
        the source of a rumour is typically not known, it is not
        possible to determine whether to believe the rumour. Sometimes
        false and harmful rumours are deliberately started in order to
        discredit an opponent. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) A government official said today that the new gun law will
        be proposed tomorrow. <br>
        (ii) Experts agree that the best way to prevent nuclear war is
        to prepare for it. <br>
        (iii) It is held that there are more than two million needless
        operations conducted every year. <br>
        (iv) Rumour has it that the President will declare a national
        holiday on his birthday. </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Argue that because we don't know the source of the information
        we have no way to evaluate the reliability of the information or
        whether it was derived rationally. Insist on seeing the proof
        for yourself. </p>

      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        The manner in which an argument (or arguer) is presented is
        taken to affect the likelihood that the conclusion is true. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) Nixon lost the presidential debate because of the sweat on

        (iii) Why don't you take the advice of that nicely dressed young
        man? </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        While it is true that the manner in which an argument is
        presented will affect whether people believe that its conclusion
        is true, nonetheless, the truth of the conclusion does not
        depend on the manner in which the argument is presented. In
        order to show that this fallacy is being committed, show that
        the style in this case does not affect the truth or falsity of
        the conclusion. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Inductive reasoning consists of inferring from the properties
        of a sample to the properties of a whole class of entities. </p>
      <p>For example, suppose we have a barrel containing of 1,000
        beans. Some of the beans are black and some of the beans are
        white. Suppose now we take a sample of 100 beans from the barrel
        and that 50 of them are white and 50 of them are black. Then we
        could infer inductively that half the beans in the barrel (that
        is, 500 of them) are black and half are white. </p>
      <p>All inductive reasoning depends on the similarity of the sample
        and the population. The more similar the same is to the
        population as a whole, the more reliable will be the inductive
        inference. On the other hand, if the sample is relevantly
        dissimilar to the population, then the inductive inference will
        be unreliable. </p>
      <p><b><font size="+1">Hasty Generalization</font></b><a

      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        The scope of evidence (in context of course) is too small to
        support the conclusion. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) Fred the Australian, stole my wallet. Thus, all Australians
        are thieves. (Of course, we shouldn't judge all Australians on
        the basis of one example.) <br>
        (ii) I asked six of my friends what they thought of the new
        taxes and they agreed that they are a good idea. The new taxes
        are therefore generally popular. <br>
        (iii) All crows are black. (Even though most of the crows (or
        even all of them) we see are black, it would be hasty to make
        such a generalization given what we know about the nature of
        albinos.) <br>

        (i) To see how Americans will vote in the next election we

      </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        In an analogy, two objects (or events), A and B are shown to be
        similar. Then it is argued that since A has property P, so also
        B must have property P. An analogy fails when the two objects, A
        and B, are different in a way which affects whether they both
        have property P. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) Employees are like nails. Just as nails must be hit in the
        head in order to make them work, so must employees. <br>
        (ii) Government is like business, so just as business must be a
        money-making enterprise, so also must government. (But the

      <p><b><font size="+1">Slothful Induction</font></b><a name="sloth"></a>
      </p>
      <p><i>Definition:</i> <br>
        The proper conclusion of an inductive argument is denied despite
        the evidence to the contrary. </p>
      <p><i>Examples:</i> <br>
        (i) Hugo has had twelve car accidents in the last six months,
        yet he insists that it is just a coincidence and not his fault.
        (Inductively, the evidence is overwhelming that it is his fault.
        This example borrowed from Barker, p. 189) <br>
        (ii) Poll after poll shows that the N.D.P will win fewer than
        ten seats in Parliament. Yet the party leader insists that the
        party is doing much better than the polls suggest. (The N.D.P.
        in fact got nine seats.) <br>
        (iii) Sure that drug has been fatal in 100 previous tests, but
        how do you know some unknown factor wasn't present causing the
        deaths? Maybe the drug is perfectly safe. (This involves
        refusing to draw an inductive conclusion on the basis that some
        arbitrary assertion has not been disproven. This is the typical
        argument of a skeptic. They don't think they need any evidence
        to justify their rejection of any generalization no matter how
        much evidence points to the other conclusion. </p>
      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Make the relevant standard of proof clear, point out that the
        evidence offered does not meet it, and point out the contrary
        evidence not taken into account in the induction. Typically this
        will lead to either an agreement, a dispute over the
        applicability of the specified standard of proof, or the
        applicability of the contrary evidence. In each case the
        argument needs to be shown to be a rational one rather than some
        arbitrary choice. </p>
      <p>I find that this kind of skepticism of any and all inductive
        generalization (except perhaps the ones the author is prejudiced
        in favor of) is the last refuge of most sloppy (and dishonest)
        thinkers since they can assert just about any possibility (yes,
        including that an omnipotant god is hiding the truth from us or
        that we are just brains in vats manipulated by mad scientists)
        to deny the validity of the inductive basis of the positions of
        their opponents. </p>

      <p><i>Proof:</i> <br>
        Give the missing evidence and show that it is relevant to the
        outcome of the inductive argument. Note that it is not
        sufficient simply to show that not all of the evidence was
        included; it must be shown that the missing evidence is relevant
        to the conclusion. </p>

      <p>A statistical generalization is a statement which is usually
        true, but not always true. Very often these are expressed using
        the word "most", as in "Most conservatives favor welfare cuts."
        Sometimes the word "generally" is used, as in "Conservatives
        generally favor welfare cuts." Or, sometimes, no specific word
        is used at all, as in: "Conservatives favour welfare cuts." </p>
      <p>Fallacies involving statistical generalizations occur because
        the generalization is not always true. Thus, when an author
        treats a statistical generalization as though it were always
        true, the author commits a fallacy. </p>

      <center><i>Propaganda Techniques</i></center>
      Knowledge of propaganda techniques is necessary to improve one's
      own propaganda and to uncover enemy PSYOP stratagems. Techniques,
      however, are not substitutes for the procedures in PSYOP planning,
      development, or dissemination.
      <p>Techniques may be categorized as: </p>
      <p><b>Characteristics of the content self-evident</b> <br>
        No additional information is required to recognize the
        characteristics of this type of propaganda. "Name calling" and
        the use of slogans are techniques of this nature. </p>
      <p><b>Additional information required to be recognized</b> <br>
        Additional information is required by the target or analyst for
        the use of this technique to be recognized. "Lying" is an
        example of this technique. The audience or analyst must have
        additional information in order to know whether a lie is being
        told. </p>
      <p><b>Evident only after extended output: </b>"Change of pace" is
        an example of this technique. Neither the audience nor the
        analyst can know that a change of pace has taken place until
        various amounts of propaganda have been brought into focus. </p>
      <p><b>Nature of the arguments used: </b>An argument is a reason,
        or a series of reasons, offered as to why the audience should
        behave, believe, or think in a certain manner. An argument is
        expressed or implied. </p>
      <p><b>Inferred intent of the originator: </b>This technique
        refers to the effect the propagandist wishes to achieve on the
        target audience. "Divisive" and "unifying" propaganda fall
        within this technique. It might also be classified on the basis
        of the effect it has on an audience. <br>
        Self-Evident technique ~ <br>
        <i>Appeal to Authority.</i> Appeals to authority cite prominent
        figures to support a position idea, argument, or course of
        action. </p>
      <p><i>Assertion.</i> Assertions are positive statements presented
        as fact. They imply that what is stated is self-evident and
        needs no further proof. Assertions may or may not be true. </p>
      <p><i>Bandwagon and Inevitable Victory.</i>
        Bandwagon-and-inevitable-victory appeals attempt to persuade the
        target audience to take a course of action "everyone else is
        taking." "Join the crowd." This technique reinforces people's
        natural desire to be on the winning side. This technique is used
        to convince the audience that a program is an expression of an
        irresistible mass movement and that it is in their interest to
        join. "Inevitable victory" invites those not already on the
        bandwagon to join those already on the road to certain victory.
        Those already, or partially, on the bandwagon are reassured that
        staying aboard is the best course of action. </p>
      <p><i>Obtain Disapproval.</i> This technique is used to get the
        audience to disapprove an action or idea by suggesting the idea
        is popular with groups hated, feared, or held in contempt by the
        target audience. Thus, if a group which supports a policy is led
        to believe that undesirable, subversive, or contemptible people
        also support it, the members of the group might decide to change
        their position. </p>
      <p><i>Glittering Generalities.</i> Glittering generalities are
        intensely emotionally appealing words so closely associated with
        highly valued concepts and beliefs that they carry conviction
        without supporting information or reason. They appeal to such
        emotions as love of country, home; desire for peace, freedom,
        glory, honor, etc. They ask for approval without examination of
        the reason. Though the words and phrases are vague and suggest
        different things to different people, their connotation is
        always favorable: "The concepts and programs of the propagandist
        are always good, desirable, virtuous." </p>
      <p>Generalities may gain or lose effectiveness with changes in
        conditions. They must, therefore, be responsive to current
        conditions. Phrases which called up pleasant associations at one
        time may evoke unpleasant or unfavorable connotations at
        another, particularly if their frame of reference has been
        altered. </p>
      <p><i>Vagueness.</i> Generalities are deliberately vague so that
        the audience may supply its own interpretations. The intention
        is to move the audience by use of undefined phrases, without
        analyzing their validity or attempting to determine their
        reasonableness or application. </p>
      <p><i>Rationalization.</i> Individuals or groups may use favorable
        generalities to rationalize questionable acts or beliefs. Vague
        and pleasant phrases are often used to justify such actions or
        beliefs. </p>
      <p><i>Simplification.</i> Favorable generalities are used to
        provide simple answers to complex social, political, economic,
        or military problems. </p>
      <p><i>Transfer.</i> This is a technique of projecting positive or
        negative qualities (praise or blame) of a person, entity,
        object, or value (an individual, group, organization, nation,
        patriotism, etc.) to another in order to make the second more
        acceptable or to discredit it. This technique is generally used
        to transfer blame from one member of a conflict to another. It
        evokes an emotional response which stimulates the target to
        identify with recognized authorities. </p>
      <p><i>Least of Evils.</i> This is a technique of acknowledging
        that the course of action being taken is perhaps undesirable but
        that any alternative would result in an outcome far worse. This
        technique is generally used to explain the need for sacrifices
        or to justify the seemingly harsh actions that displease the
        target audience or restrict personal liberties. Projecting blame
        on the enemy for the unpleasant or restrictive conditions is
        usually coupled with this technique. </p>
      <p><i>Name Calling or Substitutions of Names or Moral Labels.</i>
        This technique attempts to arouse prejudices in an audience by
        labeling the object of the propaganda campaign as something the
        target audience fears, hates, loathes, or finds undesirable. </p>
      <p>Types of name calling: </p>
      <blockquote>Direct name calling is used when the audience is
        sympathetic or neutral. It is a simple, straightforward attack
        on an opponent or opposing idea.
        <p>Indirect name calling is used when direct name calling would
          antagonize the audience. It is a label for the degree of
          attack between direct name calling and insinuation. Sarcasm
          and ridicule are employed with this technique. </p>
        <p>Cartoons, illustrations, and photographs are used in name
          calling, often with deadly effect.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <i>Dangers inherent in name calling:</i> In its extreme form, name
      calling may indicate that the propagandist has lost his sense of
      proportion or is unable to conduct a positive campaign. Before
      using this technique, the propagandist must weigh the benefits
      against the possible harmful results. lt is best to avoid use of
      this device.The obstacles are formidable, based primarily on the
      human tendency to close ranks against a stranger. For example, a
      group may despise, dislike, or even hate one of its leaders, even
      openly criticize him, but may (and probably will) resent any
      nongroup member who criticizes and makes disparaging remarks
      against that leader.
      <p><i>Pinpointing the Enemy:</i> This is a form of simplification
        in which a complex situation is reduced to the point where the
        "enemy" is unequivocally identified. For example, the president
        of country X is forced to declare a state of emergency in order
        to protect the peaceful people of his country from the brutal,
        unprovoked aggression by the leaders of country X. </p>
      <p><i>Plain Folks or Common Man:</i> The "plain folks" or "common
        man" approach attempts to convince the audience that the
        propagandist's positions reflect the common sense of the people.
        It is designed to win the confidence of the audience by
        communicating in the common manner and style of the audience.
        Propagandists use ordinary language and mannerisms (and clothes
        in face-to-face and audiovisual communications) in attempting to
        identify their point of view with that of the average person.
        With the plain folks device, the propagandist can win the
        confidence of persons who resent or distrust foreign sounding,
        intellectual speech, words, or mannerisms. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;The audience can be persuaded to identify its interests
        with those of the propagandist: </p>
      <blockquote><i>Presenting soldiers as plain folks.</i> The
        propagandist wants to make the enemy feel he is fighting against
        soldiers who are "decent, everyday folks" much like himself;
        this helps to counter themes that paint the opponent as
        a"bloodthirsty" killer.
        <p><i>Presenting civilians as plain folks.</i> The "plain folks"
          or "common man" device also can help to convince the enemy
          that the opposing nation is not composed of arrogant, immoral,
          deceitful, aggressive, warmongering people, but of people like
          himself, wishing to live at peace. </p>
        <p><i>Humanizing leaders.</i> This technique paints a more human
          portrait of US and friendly military and civilian leaders. It
          humanizes them so that the audience looks upon them as similar
          human beings or, preferably, as kind, wise, fatherly figures.
        </p>
        <p>Categories of Plain Folk Devices: </p>
        <p><i>Vernacular.</i> This is the contemporary language of a
          specific region or people as it is commonly spoken or written
          and includes songs, idioms, and jokes. The current vernacular
          of the specific target audience must be used. </p>
        <p><i>Dialect.</i> Dialect is a variation in pronunciation,
          grammar, and vocabulary from the norm of a region or nation.
          When used by the propagandist, perfection is required. This
          technique is best left to those to whom the dialect is native,
          because native level speakers are generally the best users of
          dialects in propaganda appeals. </p>
        <p><i>Errors.</i> Scholastic pronunciation, enunciation, and
          delivery give the impression of being artificial. To give the
          impression of spontaneity, deliberately hesitate between
          phrases, stammer, or mispronounce words. When not overdone,
          the effect is one of deep sincerity. Errors in written
          material may be made only when they are commonly made by
          members of the reading audience. Generally, errors should be
          restricted to colloquialisms. </p>
        <p><i>Homey words.</i> Homey words are forms of "virtue words"
          used in the everyday life of the average man. These words are
          familiar ones, such as "home," "family," "children," "farm,"
          "neighbors," or cultural equivalents. They evoke a favorable
          emotional response and help transfer the sympathies of the
          audience to the propagandist. Homey words are widely used to
          evoke nostalgia. Care must be taken to assure that homey
          messages addressed to enemy troops do not also have the same
          effect on US/friendly forces. </p>
        <p>If the propaganda or the propagandist lacks naturalness,
          there may be an adverse backlash. The audience may resent what
          it considers attempts to mock it, its language, and its ways.
        </p>
        <p><i>Social Disapproval.</i> This is a technique by which the
          propagandist marshals group acceptance and suggests that
          attitudes or actions contrary to the one outlined will result
          in social rejection, disapproval, or outright ostracism. The
          latter, ostracism, is a control practice widely used within
          peer groups and traditional societies. </p>
        <p><i>Virtue Words.</i> These are words in the value system of
          the target audience which tend to produce a positive image
          when attached to a person or issue. Peace, happiness,
          security, wise leadership, freedom, etc., are virtue words. </p>
        <p><i>Slogans.</i> A slogan is a brief striking phrase that may
          include labeling and stereotyping. If ideas can be sloganized,
          they should be, as good slogans are self-perpetuating. </p>
        <p><i>Testimonials.</i> Testimonials are quotations, in or out
          of context, especially cited to support or reject a given
          policy, action, program, or personality. The reputation or the
          role (expert, respected public figure, etc.) of the individual
          giving the statement is exploited. The testimonial places the
          official sanction of a respected person or authority on a
          propaganda message. This is done in an effort to cause the
          target audience to identify itself with the authority or to
          accept the authority's opinions and beliefs as its own.
          Several types of testimonials are: </p>
        <p><i>Official Sanction.</i> The testimonial authority must have
          given the endorsement or be clearly on record as having
          approved the attributed idea, concept, action, or belief.</p>
      </blockquote>
      Four factors are involved:
      <p><i>Accomplishment.</i> People have confidence in an authority
        who has demonstrated outstanding ability and proficiency in his
        field.This accomplishment should be related to the subject of
        the testimonial. </p>
      <blockquote><i>Identification with the target.</i> People have
        greater confidence in an authority with whom they have a common
        bond. For example, the soldier more readily trusts an officer
        with whom he has undergone similar arduous experiences than a
        civilian authority on military subjects.
        <p><i>Position of authority.</i> The official position of
          authority may instill confidence in the testimony; i.e., head
          of state, division commander, etc. </p>
        <p><i>Inanimate objects.</i> Inanimate objects may be used in
          the testimonial device. In such cases, the propagandist seeks
          to transfer physical attributes of an inanimate object to the
          message. The Rock of Gibraltar, for example, is a type of
          inanimate object associated with steadfast strength.</p>
      </blockquote>
      Personal Sources of Testimonial Authority:
      <blockquote><i>Enemy leaders.</i> The enemy target audience will
        generally place great value on its high level military leaders
        as a source of information.
        <p><i>Fellow soldiers.</i> Because of their common experiences,
          soldiers form a bond of comradeship. As a result, those in the
          armed forces are inclined to pay close attention to what other
          soldiers have to say. </p>
        <p><i>Opposing leaders.</i> Testimonials of leaders of the
          opposing nation are of particular value in messages that
          outline war aims and objectives for administering the enemy
          nation after it capitulates. </p>
        <p><i>Famous scholars, writers, and other personalities.</i>
          Frequently, statements of civilians known to the target as
          authoritative or famous scholars, writers, scientists,
          commentators, etc., can be effectively used in propaganda
          messages.</p>
      </blockquote>
      Nonpersonal Sources of Testimonial Authority:
      <p>Institutions, ideologies, national flags, religious, and other
        nonpersonal sources are often used. The creeds, beliefs,
        principles, or dogmas of respected authorities or other public
        figures may make effective propaganda testimonials. </p>
      <p>Factors To Be Considered: </p>
      <blockquote><i>Plausibility.</i> The testimonial must be plausible
        to the target audience. The esteem in which an authority is held
        by the target audience will not always transfer an implausible
        testimonial into effective propaganda.
        <p><i>False testimonials.</i> Never use false testimonials.
          Highly selective testimonials? Yes. Lies (fabrications)?
          Never. Fabricated (false) testimonials are extremely
          vulnerable because their lack of authenticity makes them easy
          to challenge and discredit.</p>
      </blockquote>
      Propaganda Techniques whihc are Based on Characteristics of the
      Content but which Require Additional Information on the Part of an
      Ananlyst to be Recognized ~ <br>
      <i>Incredible truths.</i> There are times when the unbelievable
      (incredible) truth not only can but should be used.
      <p>Among these occasions are: </p>
      <blockquote>When the psychological operator is certain that a
        vitally important event will take place.
        <p>A catastrophic event, or one of significant tactical or
          strategic importance, unfavorable to the enemy has occurred
          and the news has been hidden from the enemy public or troops.
        </p>
        <p>The enemy government has denied or glossed over an event
          detrimental to its cause.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <i>A double-cutting edge.</i> This technique has a double-cutting
      edge: It increases the credibility of the US/friendly
      psychological operator while decreasing the credibility of the
      enemy to the enemy's target audience. Advanced security clearance
      must be obtained before using this technique so that operations or
      projects will not be jeopardized or compromised. Actually,
      propagandists using this technique will normally require access to
      special compartmented information and facilities to avoid
      compromise of other sensitive operations or projects of agencies
      of the US Government. Though such news will be incredible to the
      enemy public, it should be given full play by the psychological
      operator. This event and its significance will eventually become
      known to the enemy public in spite of government efforts to hide
      it. The public will recall (the psychological operator will "help"
      the recall process) that the incredible news was received from
      US/allied sources. They will also recall the deception of their
      government. The prime requirement in using this technique is that
      the disseminated incredible truth must be or be certain to become
      a reality.
      <p><i>Insinuation.</i> Insinuation is used to create or stir up
        the suspicions of the target audience against ideas, groups, or
        individuals in order to divide an enemy. The propagandist hints,
        suggests, and implies, allowing the audience to draw its own
        conclusions. Latent suspicions and cleavages within the enemy
        camp are exploited in an attempt to structure them into active
        expressions of disunity which weaken the enemy's war effort. </p>
      <p><i>Exploitable vulnerabilities.</i> Potential cleavages which
        may be exploited include the following: </p>
      <blockquote>Political differences between the enemy nation and its
        allies or satellites.
        <p>Ethnic and regional differences. </p>
        <p>Religious, political, economic, or social differences. </p>
        <p>History of civilian animosity or unfair treatment toward
          enemy soldiers. </p>
        <p>Comforts available to rear area soldiers and not available to
          combat soldiers. </p>
        <p>People versus the bureaucracy or hierarchy. </p>
        <p>Political differences between the ruling elite, between
          coalitions members, or between rulers and those out of power.
        </p>
        <p>Differences showing a few benefiting at the expense of the
          general populace. </p>
        <p>Unequal or inequitable tax burdens, or the high level of
          taxes. The audience should be informed of hidden taxes. </p>
        <p>The scarcity of consumer goods for the general public and
          their availability to the various elites and the dishonest. </p>
        <p>Costs of present government policies in terms of lost
          opportunities to accomplish constructive socially desirable
          goals. </p>
        <p>The powerlessness of the individual. (This may be used to
          split the audience from the policies of its government by
          disassociating its members from those policies.) This
          technique could be used in preparing a campaign to gain
          opposition to those government policies.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <i>Insinuation devices.</i> A number of devices are available to
      exploit these and similar vulnerabilities:
      <blockquote><i>Leading questions:</i> The propagandist may ask
        questions which suggest only one possible answer. Thus, the
        question, "What is there to do now that your unit is surrounded
        and you are completely cut off?" insinuates that surrender or
        desertion is the only reasonable alternative to annihilation.
        <p><i>Humor:</i> Humor can be an effective form of insinuation.
          Jokes and cartoons about the enemy find a ready audience among
          those persons in the target country or military camp who
          normally reject straightforward accusations or assertions.
          Jokes about totalitarian leaders and their subordinates often
          spread with ease and rapidity. However, the psychological
          operator must realize that appreciation of humor differs among
          target groups and so keep humor within the appropriate
          cultural context. </p>
        <p><i>Pure motives.</i> This technique makes it clear that the
          side represented by the propagandist is acting in the best
          interests of the target audience, insinuating that the enemy
          is acting to the contrary. For example, the propagandist can
          use the theme that a satellite force fighting on the side of
          the enemy is insuring the continued subjugation of its country
          by helping the common enemy. </p>
        <p><i>Guilt by association:</i> Guilt by association links a
          person, group, or idea to other persons, groups, or ideas
          repugnant to the target audience. The insinuation is that the
          connection is not mutual, accidental, or superficial. </p>
        <p><i>Rumor:</i> Malicious rumors are also a potentially
          effective form of insinuation. </p>
        <p><i>Pictorial and photographic propaganda:</i> A photograph,
          picture, or cartoon can often insinuate a derogatory charge
          more effectively than words. The combination of words and
          photograph, picture, or cartoon can be far more effective. In
          this content, selected and composite photographs can be
          extremely effective . </p>
        <p><i>Vocal:</i> Radio propagandists can artfully suggest a
          derogatory notion, not only with the words they use, but also
          by the way in which they deliver them. Significant pauses,
          tonal inflections, sarcastic pronunciation, ridiculing
          enunciation, can be more subtle than written insinuation. </p>
        <p><i>Card stacking or selective omission.</i> This is the
          process of choosing from a variety of facts only those which
          support the propagandist's purpose.</p>
      </blockquote>
      In using this technique, facts are selected and presented which
      most effectively strengthen and authenticate the point of view of
      the propagandist. It includes the collection of all available
      material pertaining to a subject and the selection of that
      material which most effectively supports the propaganda line. Card
      stacking, case making, and censorship are all forms of selection.
      Success or failure depends on how successful the propagandist is
      in selecting facts or "cards" and presenting or "stacking" them.
      <p><i>Increase prestige.</i> In time of armed conflict, leading
        personalities, economic and social systems, and other
        institutions making up a nation are constantly subjected to
        propaganda attacks. Card stacking is used to counter these
        attacks by publicizing and reiterating the best qualities of the
        institutions, concepts, or persons being attacked. Like most
        propaganda techniques, card stacking is used to supplement other
        methods. </p>
      <p>The technique may also be used to describe a subject as
        virtuous or evil and to give simple answers to a complicated
        subject. </p>
      <p>An intelligent propagandist makes his case by imaginative
        selection of facts.The work of the card stacker in using
        selected facts is divided into two main phases: </p>
      <blockquote>First, the propagandist selects only favorable facts
        and presents them to the target in such a manner as to obtain a
        desired reaction.
        <p>Second, the propagandist uses these facts as a basis for
          conclusions, trying to lead the audience into accepting the
          conclusions by accepting the facts presented.</p>
      </blockquote>
      Presenting the other side. Some persons in a target audience
      believe that neither belligerent is entirely virtuous. To them
      propaganda solely in terms of right and wrong may not be credible.
      Agreement with minor aspects of the enemy's point of view may
      overcome this cynicism. Another use of presenting the other side
      is to reduce the impact of propaganda that opposing propagandists
      are likely to be card stacking (selective omission).
      <p>Lying and distortion. Lying is stating as truth that which is
        contrary to fact. For example, assertions may be lies. This
        technique will not be used by US personnel. It is presented for
        use of the analyst of enemy propaganda. </p>
      <p>Simplification. This is a technique in which the many facts of
        a situation are reduced so the right or wrong, good or evil, of
        an act or decision is obvious to all. This technique
        (simplification) provides simple solutions for complex problems.
        By suggesting apparently simple solutions for complex problems,
        this technique offers simplified interpretations of events,
        ideas, concepts, or personalities. Statements are positive and
        firm;qualifying words are never used. </p>
      <p>Simplification may be used to sway uneducated and educated
        audiences. This is true because many persons are well educated
        or highly skilled, trained specialists in a specific field, but
        the limitations of time and energy often force them to turn to
        and accept simplifications to understand, relate, and react to
        other areas of interest. </p>
      <p>Simplification has the following characteristics: </p>
      <p><i>It thinks for others:</i> Some people accept information
        which they cannot verify personally as long as the source is
        acceptable to them or the authority is considered expert. Others
        absorb whatever they read, see, or hear with little or no
        discrimination. Some people are too lazy or unconcerned to think
        problems through. Others are uneducated and willingly accept
        convenient simplifications. </p>
      <p><i>It is concise:</i> Simplification gives the impression of
        going to the heart of the matter in a few words. The average
        member of the target audience will not even consider that there
        may be another answer to the problem. </p>
      <p><i>It builds ego:</i> Some people are reluctant to believe that
        any field of endeavor, except their own, is difficult to
        understand. For example, a layman is pleased to hear that '"law
        is just common sense dressed up in fancy language," or "modern
        art is really a hodgepodge of aimless experiment or nonsense."
        Such statements reinforce the ego of the lay audience. It is
        what they would like to believe, because they are afraid that
        law and modern art may actually be beyond their understanding.
        Simple explanations are given for complex subjects and problems.
        <br>
        Stereotyping is a form of simplification used to fit persons,
        groups, nations, or events into readymade categories that tend
        to produce a desired image of good or bad. Stereotyping puts the
        subject (people, nations, etc.) or event into a simplistic
        pattern without any distinguishing individual characteristics. <br>
        <font size="-0">Characteristics of Content which may become
          Evident when Numerous Pieces of Output are Examined ~</font> <br>
        <i>Change of Pace.</i> Change of pace is a technique of
        switching from belligerent to peaceful output, from "hot" to
        "cold," from persuasion to threat, from gloomy prophecy to
        optimism, from emotion to fact. </p>
      <p><i>Stalling.</i> Stalling is a technique of deliberately
        withholding information until its timeliness is past, thereby
        reducing the possibility of undesired impact. </p>
      <p><i>Shift of Scene.</i> With this technique, the propagandist
        replaces one "field of battle" with another. It is an attempt to
        take the spotlight off an unfavorable situation or condition by
        shifting it to another, preferably of the opponent, so as to
        force the enemy to go on the defense. </p>
      <p><b>Repetition ~</b> </p>
      <p>An idea or position is repeated in an attempt to elicit an
        almost automatic response from the audience or to reinforce an
        audience's opinion or attitude. This technique is extremely
        valid and useful because the human being is basically a creature
        of habit and develops skills and values by repetition (like
        walking, talking, code of ethics, etc.). An idea or position may
        be repeated many times in one message or in many messages. The
        intent is the same in both instances, namely, to elicit an
        immediate response or to reinforce an opinion or attitude. </p>
      <blockquote>The audience is not familiar with the details of the
        threat posed. Ignorance of the details can be used to pose a
        threat and build fear.
        <p>Members of the audience are self-centered. </p>
        <p>The target can take immediate action to execute simple,
          specific instructions.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <i>Fear of change</i>. People fear change, particularly sudden,
      imposed change over which they have no control. They fear it will
      take from them status, wealth, family, friends, comfort, safety,
      life, or limb. That's why the man in the foxhole hesitates to
      leave it. He knows and is accustomed to the safety it affords. He
      is afraid that moving out of his foxhole will expose him to new
      and greater danger. That is why the psychological campaign must
      give him a safe, honorable way out of his predicament or
      situation.
      <p><i>Terrorism.</i> The United States is absolutely opposed to
        the use of terror or terror tactics. But the psychological
        operator can give a boomerang effect to enemy terror, making it
        reverberate against the practitioner, making him repugnant to
        his own people, and all others who see the results of his
        heinous savagery. This can be done by disseminating fully
        captioned photographs in the populated areas of the terrorist's
        homeland. Such leaflets will separate civilians from their armed
        forces; it will give them second thoughts about the decency and
        honorableness of their cause, make them wonder about the
        righteousness of their ideology, and make the terrorists
        repugnant to them. Followup leaflets can "fire the flames" of
        repugnancy, indignation, and doubt, as most civilizations find
        terror repugnant. </p>
      <p><i>In third countries.</i> Fully captioned photographs
        depicting terroristic acts may be widely distributed in third
        countries (including the nation sponsoring the enemy) where they
        will instill a deep revulsion in the general populace.
        Distribution in neutral countries is particularly desirable in
        order to swing the weight of unbiased humanitarian opinion
        against the enemy. </p>
      <p>The enemy may try to rationalize and excuse its conduct
        (terroristic), but in so doing, it will compound the adverse
        effect of its actions, because it can never deny the validity of
        true photographic representations of its acts. Thus, world
        opinion will sway to the side of the victimized people. </p>
      <p><i>Friendly territory.</i> Under no circumstances should such
        leaflets be distributed in friendly territory. To distribute
        them in the friendly area in which the terrorists' acts took
        place would only create feelings of insecurity. This would
        defeat the purpose of the psychological operator, which is to
        build confidence in the government or agency he represents. </p>

      <p>Built upon <i>Thirteen Techniques for Truth Suppression</i> by
        David Martin, the following may be useful to the initiate in the
        world of dealing with veiled and half-truth, lies, and
        suppression of truth when serious crimes are studied in public
        forums. This, sadly, includes every day news media, one of the
        worst offenders with respect to being a source of
        disinformation. Where the crime involves a conspiracy, or a
        conspiracy to cover up the crime, there will invariably be a
        disinformation campaign launched against those seeking to
        uncover and expose the truth and/or the conspiracy. There are
        specific tactics which disinfo artists tend to apply, as
        revealed here. Also included with this material are seven common
        traits of the disinfo artist which may also prove useful in
        identifying players and motives. The more a particular party
        fits the traits and is guilty of following the rules, the more
        likely they are a professional disinfo artist with a vested
        motive. People can be bought, threatened, or blackmailed into
        providing disinformation, so even "good guys" can be suspect in
        many cases. </p>
      <p>A rational person participating as one interested in the truth
        will evaluate that chain of evidence and conclude either that
        the links are solid and conclusive, that one or more links are
        weak and need further development before conclusion can be
        arrived at, or that one or more links can be broken, usually
        invalidating (but not necessarily so, if parallel links already
        exist or can be found, or if a particular link was merely
        supportive, but not in itself key) the argument. The game is
        played by raising issues which either strengthen or weaken
        (preferably to the point of breaking) these links. It is the job
        of a disinfo artist to interfere with these evaluation... to at
        least make people think the links are weak or broken when, in
        truth, they are not... or to propose alternative solutions
        leading away from the truth. Often, by simply impeding and
        slowing down the process through disinformation tactics, a level
        of victory is assured because apathy increases with time and
        rhetoric. </p>
      <p>It would seem true in almost every instance, that if one cannot
        break the chain of evidence for a given solution, revelation of
        truth has won out. If the chain is broken either a new link must
        be forged, or a whole new chain developed, or the solution is
        invalid an a new one must be found... but truth still wins out.
        There is no shame in being the creator or supporter of a failed
        solution, chain, or link, if done with honesty in search of the
        truth. This is the rational approach. While it is understandable
        that a person can become emotionally involved with a particular
        side of a given issue, it is really unimportant who wins, as
        long as truth wins. But the disinfo artist will seek to
        emotionalize and chastise any failure (real or false claims
        thereof), and will seek by means of intimidation to prevent
        discussion in general. </p>

      <p><b><font size="+1">Eight Traits of The Disinformationalist ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p>1. Avoidance <br>
        2. Selectivity <br>
        3. Coincidental <br>
        4. Teamwork <br>
        5. Anti-conspiratorial <br>
        6. Artificial Emotions <br>
        7. Inconsistent <br>
        8. Newly Discovered: Time Constant </p>
      <p>It is the disinfo artist and those who may pull their strings
        (those who stand to suffer should the crime be solved) MUST seek
        to prevent rational and complete examination of any chain of
        evidence which would hang them. Since fact and truth seldom fall
        on their own, they must be overcome with lies and deceit. Those
        who are professional in the art of lies and deceit, such as the
        intelligence community and the professional criminal (often the
        same people or at least working together), tend to apply fairly
        well defined and observable tools in this process. However, the
        public at large is not well armed against such weapons, and is
        often easily led astray by these time-proven tactics.
        Remarkably, not even media and law enforcement have NOT BEEN
        TRAINED to deal with these issues. For the most part, only the
        players themselves understand the rules of the game. </p>
      <p>This why concepts from the film, <i>Wag-The-Dog</i>, actually
        work. If you saw that movie, know that there is at least one
        real-world counterpart to Al Pacino's character. For CIA, it is
        Mark Richards, who was called in to orchestrate the media
        response to Waco on behalf of Janet Reno. Mark Richards is the
        acknowledged High Priest of Disinformation. His appointment was
        extremely appropriate, since the CIA was VERY present at Waco
        from the very beginning of the cult to the very end of their
        days --- just as it was at the People's Temple in Jonestown.
        Richards purpose in life is damage control. </p>
      <p>For such disinformationalists, the overall aim is to avoid
        discussing links in the chain of evidence which cannot be broken
        by truth, but at all times, to use clever deceptions or lies to
        make select links seem weaker than they are, create the illusion
        of a break, or better still, cause any who are considering the
        chain to be distracted in any number of ways, including the
        method of questioning the credentials of the presenter. Please
        understand that fact is fact, regardless of the source.
        Likewise, truth is truth, regardless of the source. This is why
        criminals are allowed to testify against other criminals. Where
        a motive to lie may truly exist, only actual evidence that the
        testimony itself IS a lie renders it completely invalid. Were a
        known 'liar's' testimony to stand on its own without supporting
        fact, it might certainly be of questionable value, but if the
        testimony (argument) is based on verifiable or otherwise
        demonstrable facts, it matters not who does the presenting or
        what their motives are, or if they have lied in the past or even
        if motivated to lie in this instance -- the facts or links would
        and should stand or fall on their own merit and their part in
        the matter will merely be supportive. </p>
      <p>Moreover, particularly with respects to public forums such as
        newspaper letters to the editor, and Internet chat and news
        groups, the disinfo type has a very important role. In these
        forums, the principle topics of discussion are generally
        attempts by individuals to cause other persons to become
        interested in their own particular position, idea, or solution
        -- very much in development at the time. People often use such
        mediums as a sounding board and in hopes of pollination to
        better form their ideas. Where such ideas are critical of
        government or powerful, vested groups (especially if their
        criminality is the topic), the disinfo artist has yet another
        role -- the role of nipping it in the bud. They also seek to
        stage the concept, the presenter, and any supporters as less
        than credible should any possible future confrontation in more
        public forums result due to their early successes. You can often
        spot the disinfo types at work here by the unique application of
        "higher standards" of discussion than necessarily warranted.
        They will demand that those presenting arguments or concepts
        back everything up with the same level of expertise as a
        professor, researcher, or investigative writer. Anything less
        renders any discussion meaningless and unworthy in their
        opinion, and anyone who disagrees is obviously stupid -- and
        they generally put it in exactly those terms. </p>
      <p>So, as you read any such discussions, particularly so in
        Internet news groups (NG), decide for yourself when a rational
        argument is being applied and when disinformation, psyops
        (psychological warfare operations) or trickery is the tool.
        Accuse those guilty of the later freely. They (both those
        deliberately seeking to lead you astray, and those who are
        simply foolish or misguided thinkers) generally run for cover
        when thus illuminated, or -- put in other terms, they put up or
        shut up (a perfectly acceptable outcome either way, since truth
        is the goal.) Here are the twenty-five methods and seven traits,
        some of which don't apply directly to NG application. Each
        contains a simple example in the form of actual (some
        paraphrased for simplicity) from NG comments on commonly known
        historical events, and a proper response. Accusations should not
        be overused -- reserve for repeat offenders and those who use
        multiple tactics. Responses should avoid falling into emotional
        traps or informational sidetracks, unless it is feared that some
        observers will be easily dissuaded by the trickery. Consider
        quoting the complete rule rather than simply citing it, as
        others will not have reference. Offer to provide a complete copy
        of the rule set upon request (see permissions statement at end):

      <p><i>Note</i>: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on
        situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability
        of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are
        generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key
        players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or

        Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it -- especially if
        you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it's not reported,
        it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Media was present in the courtroom (Hunt vs.
        Liberty Lobby) when CIA agent Marita Lorenz 'confession'
        testimony regarding CIA direct participation in the planning and
        assassination of John Kennedy was revealed. All media reported
        was that E. Howard Hunt lost his libel case against Liberty
        Lobby (Liberty Lobby's newspaper, The Spotlight, had reported
        Hunt was in Dallas that day and were sued for the story). See
        Mark Lane's remarkable book, Plausible Denial, for the full
        confessional transcript. </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: There is no possible response unless
        you are aware of the material and can make it public yourself..
        In any such attempt, be certain to target any known silent party
        as likely complicit in a cover up. In this case, it would be the
        entire Time-Warner Media Group, among others. This author is
        relatively certain that reporters were hand-picked to cover this
        case from among those having intelligence community ties. </p>
      <p><b>(2) <i>Become Incredulous and Indignant ~</i></b> Avoid
        discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can
        be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise
        sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare
        you!' gambit. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'How dare you suggest that the Branch Davidians
        were murdered! the FBI and BATF are made up of America's finest
        and best trained law enforcement, operate under the strictest of
        legal requirements, and are under the finest leadership the
        President could want to appoint.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: You are avoiding the Waco issue with
        disinformation tactics. Your high opinion of FBI is not founded
        in fact. All you need do is examine Ruby Ridge and any number of
        other examples, and you will see a pattern of abuse of power
        that demands attention to charges against FBI/BATF at Waco. Why
        do you refuse to address the issues with disinformation tactics
        (rule 2 - become incredulous and indignant)? </p>
      <p><b>(3) <i>Create Rumor Mongers</i> ~</b> Avoid discussing
        issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or
        evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory
        terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method
        which works especially well with a silent press, because the
        only way the public can learn of the facts are through such
        'arguable rumors'. If you can associate the material with the
        Internet, use this fact to certify it a 'wild rumor' from a
        'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis in fact.
      </p>
      <p>'You can't prove his material was legitimately from French
        Intelligence. Pierre Salinger had a chance to show his 'proof'
        that flight 800 was brought down by friendly fire, and he
        didn't. All he really had was the same old baseless rumor that's
        been floating around the Internet for months.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. The Internet charge reported widely is
        based on a single FBI interview statement to media and a similar
        statement by a Congressman, neither of which had actually seen
        Pierre's document. As the FBI is being accused in participating
        in a cover up of this matter and Pierre claims his material is
        not Internet sourced, it is natural that FBI would have reason
        to paint his material in a negative light. For you to assume the
        FBI to have no bias in the face of Salinger's credentials and
        unchanged stance suggests you are biased. At the best you can
        say the matter is in question. Further, to imply that material
        found on Internet is worthless is not founded. At best you may
        say it must be considered carefully before accepting it, which
        will require addressing the actual issues. Why do you refuse to
        address these issues with disinformation tactics (rule 3 -
        create rumor mongers)? </p>
      <p><b>(4) <i>Use a Straw Man</i> ~</b> Find or create a seeming
        element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock
        down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad.
        Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on
        your interpretation of the opponent/opponent
        arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest
        charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way
        which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated
        alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: When trying to defeat reports by the Times of
        London that spy-sat images reveal an object racing towards and
        striking flight 800, a straw man is used. The
        disinformationalist, later identified as having worked for Naval
        Intelligence, simply stated: 'If these images exist, the public
        has not seen them. Why? They don't exist, and never did. You
        have no evidence and thus, your entire case falls flat.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. You imply deceit and deliberately
        establish an impossible and unwarranted test. It is perfectly
        natural that the public has not seen them, nor will they for
        some considerable time, if ever. To produce them would violate
        national security with respect to intelligence gathering
        capabilities and limitations, and you should know this. Why do
        you refuse to address the issues with such disinformation
        tactics (rule 4 - use a straw man)?' </p>
      <p><b>(5) <i>Sidetrack Opponents with Name-Calling and Ridicule</i>
          ~</b> This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger'
        ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach.
        Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks',
        'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy
        buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics',
        'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from
        support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid
        dealing with issues. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'You believe what you read in the Spotlight?
        The Publisher, Willis DeCarto, is a well-known right-wing
        racist. I guess we know your politics -- does your Bible have a
        swastika on it? That certainly explains why you support this
        wild-eyed, right-wing conspiracy theory.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. Your imply guilt by association and
        attack truth on the basis of the messenger. The Spotlight is
        well known Populist media source responsible for releasing facts
        and stories well before mainstream media will discuss the issues
        through their veil of silence. Willis DeCarto has successfully
        handled lawsuits regarding slanderous statements such as yours.
        Your undemonstrated charges against the messenger have nothing
        to do with the facts or the issues, and fly in the face of
        reason. Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such
        disinformation tactics (rule 5 - sidetrack opponents with name
        calling and ridicule)?' </p>
      <p><b>(6) <i>Hit and Run</i> ~</b> In any public forum, make a
        brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then
        scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore
        any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and
        letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new
        identities can be called upon without having to explain
        criticism reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other
        attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any
        subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent's
        viewpoint. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: ''This stuff is garbage. Where do you
        conspiracy lunatics come up with this crap? I hope you all get
        run over by black helicopters.' Notice it even has a farewell
        sound to it, so it won't seem curious if the author is never
        heard from again. </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. Your comments or opinions fail to offer
        any meaningful dialog or information, and are worthless except
        to pander to emotionalism, and in fact, reveal you to be
        emotionally insecure with these matters. If you do not like
        reading 'this crap', why do you frequent this NG which is
        clearly for the purpose of such discussion? Why do you refuse to
        address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics (rule 6
        - hit and run)?' </p>
      <p><b>(7) <i>Question Motives</i> ~</b> Twist or amplify any fact
        which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of
        a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing
        issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'With the talk-show circuit and the book deal,
        it looks like you can make a pretty good living spreading lies.'
      </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with

        the messenger or his credentials, but cowardly fail to offer any

        presented are 'lies', why not simply so illustrate? Why do you
        refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation
        tactics (rule 6 - question motives)?' </p>
      <p><b>(8) <i>Invoke Authority</i> ~</b> Claim for yourself or
        associate yourself with authority and present your argument with
        enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to illustrate you are 'one who
        knows', and simply say it isn't so without discussing issues or
        demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. </p>

      <p><b>(9) <i>Play Dumb</i> ~</b> No matter what evidence or
        logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with
        denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any
        proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a
        conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'Nothing you say makes any sense. Your logic is
        idiotic. Your facts nonexistent. Better go back to the drawing
        board and try again.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with

        tactics (Rule 9 - play dumb)?' </p>
      <p><b>(10) <i>Associate Opponent Charges with Old News</i> ~</b>
        A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale
        matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on
        which can be or were already easily dealt with - a kind of
        investment for the future should the matter not be so easily
        contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a
        straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the
        initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of
        validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated
        with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash
        without need to address current issues -- so much the better
        where the opponent is or was involved with the original source.
      </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'Flight 553's crash was pilot error, according
        to the NTSB findings. Digging up new witnesses who say the CIA
        brought it down at a selected spot and were waiting for it with
        50 agents won't revive that old dead horse buried by NTSB more
        than twenty years ago.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. Your ignore the issues and imply they

        news)?' </p>
      <p><b>(11) <i>Establish and Rely Upon Fall-Back Positions</i> ~</b>
        Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the 'high
        road' and 'confess' with candor that some innocent mistake, in
        hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have seized on the
        opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater
        criminalities which, 'just isn't so.' Others can reinforce this
        on your behalf, later, and even publicly 'call for an end to the
        nonsense' because you have already 'done the right thing.' Done
        properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for 'coming
        clean' and 'owning up' to your mistakes without addressing more
        serious issues. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'Reno admitted in hindsight she should have
        taken more time to question the data provided by subordinates on
        the deadliness of CS-4 and the likely Davidian response to its
        use, but she was so concerned about the children that she
        elected, in what she now believes was a sad and terrible
        mistake, to order the tear gas be used.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. Your evade the true issue by focusing on

      <p><b>(12) <i>Enigmas Have No Solution</i> ~</b> Drawing upon the
        overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the
        multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too
        complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the
        matter to begin to loose interest more quickly without having to
        address the actual issues. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'I don't see how you can claim Vince Foster was
        murdered since you can't prove a motive. Before you could do
        that, you would have to completely solve the whole controversy
        over everything that went on in the White House and in Arkansas,
        and even then, you would have to know a heck of a lot more about
        what went on within the NSA, the Travel Office, and the secret
        Grand Jury, and on, and on, and on. It's hopeless. Give it up.'

      <p><i>Example</i>: 'The news media operates in a fiercely
        competitive market where stories are gold. This means they dig,
        dig, dig for the story -- often doing a better job than law
        enforcement. If there was any evidence that BATF had prior
        knowledge of the Oklahoma City bombing, they would surely have
        uncovered it and reported it. They haven't reported it, so there

        Hunt and Liberty Lobby, they only told us the trial verdict.

        Wonderland logic)?' </p>
      <p><b>(14) <i>Demand Complete Solutions</i> ~&nbsp;</b> Avoid the
        issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand
        completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for
        rule 10. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'Since you know so much, if James Earl Ray is
        as innocent as you claim, who really killed Martin Luther King,
        how was it planned and executed, how did they frame Ray and fool
        the FBI, and why?' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. It is not necessary to completely
        resolve any full matter in order to examine any relative
        attached issue. Discussion of any evidence of Ray's innocence
        can stand alone to serve truth, and any alternative solution to
        the crime, while it may bolster that truth, can also stand
        alone. Why do you refuse to address the issues by use of such
        disinformation tactics (rule 14 - demand complete solutions)? </p>
      <p><b>(15) <i>Fit the Facts to Alternate Conclusions</i> ~</b>

        a catastrophic breakup which ruptured the fuel tank and caused
        it to explode.' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: The best definitive example of avoiding
        issues by this technique is, perhaps, Arlan Specter's Magic
        Bullet from the Warren Report. This was eloquently defeated in
        court but media blindly accepted it without challenge. Thus
        rewarded, disinformationalists do not shrink from its
        application, even though today, thanks in part to the movie,
        JFK, most Americans do now understand it was fabricated
        nonsense. Thus the defense which works best may actually be to
        cite the Magic Bullet. 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. Your imaginative twisting of facts
        rivals that of Arlan Specter's Magic Bullet in the Warren

        invented. You invent a cargo door problem when there has been
        not one shred of evidence from the crash investigation to
        support it, and in fact, actual photos of the cargo door hinges
        and locks disprove you. Why do you refuse to address the issues

        alternate conclusion)?' </p>
      <p><b>(16) <i>Vanish Evidence and Witnesses</i> ~</b> If it does

        his death was faked and the list of CIA agents found on his boat
        deliberately placed there to support a purge at CIA. You have no
        proof. Why can't you accept the Police reports?' This is a good
        ploy, since the dental records and autopsy report showing his
        body was two inches too long and the teeth weren't his were lost
        right after his wife demanded inquiry, and since his body was
        cremated before she could view it -- all that remains are the
        Police Reports. Handy. </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: There is no suitable response to actual
        vanished materials or persons, unless you can shed light on the
        matter, particularly if you can tie the event to a cover up
        other criminality. However, with respect to dialog where it is
        used against the discussion, you can respond... 'You are
        avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics. The best you can
        say is that the matter is in contention ONLY because of highly
        suspicious matters such as the simultaneous and mysterious

        topic. This works especially well with companions who can
        'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion
        arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. </p>

        laundering through Mena, Arkansas, and certainly, there was no
        Bill Clinton knowledge of it because it simply didn't happen.

        balance and at a disadvantage in the election: Dole is such a
        weak candidate with nothing to offer that they are desperate to
        come up with something to swing the polls. Dole simply has no

        issues by use of such disinformation tactics (rule 17- change
        the subject)?' </p>
      <p><b><i>(18) Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents ~</i></b>
        If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents
        and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make
        them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render
        their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid
        discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their
        emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid
        the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to
        criticism.' </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'You are such an idiot to think that possible
        -- or are you such a paranoid conspiracy buff that you think the
        'gubment' is cooking your pea-brained skull with microwaves,
        which is the only justification you might have for dreaming up
        this drivel.' After a drawing an emotional response: 'Ohhh... I
        do seem to have touched a sensitive nerve. Tsk, tsk. What's the
        matter? The truth too hot for you to handle? Perhaps you should
        stop relying on the Psychic Friends Network and see a
        psychiatrist for some real professional help...' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. You attempt to draw me into emotional
        response without discussion of the issues. If you have something
        useful to contribute which defeats my argument, let's here it --
        preferably without snide and unwarranted personal attacks, if
        you can manage to avoid sinking so low. Your useless rhetoric
        serves no purpose here if that is all you can manage. Why do you
        refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation
        tactics (rule 18 - emotionalize, antagonize, and goad
        opponents)?' </p>
      <p><b>(19) <i>Ignore Proof Presented, Demand Impossible Proofs</i>
          ~</b> This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule.
        Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in
        public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof
        that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist,
        but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is
        known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder
        weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may
        be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of
        media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are
        acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or
        other authorities have any meaning or relevance. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: 'All he's done is to quote the liberal media
        and a bunch of witnesses who aren't qualified. Where's his
        proof? Show me wreckage from flight 800 that shows a missile hit
        it!' </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: 'You are avoiding the issue with
        disinformation tactics. You presume for us not to accept Don
        Phillips, reporter for the <i>Washington Post</i>, Al Baker,
        Craig Gordon or Liam Pleven, reporters for <i>Newsday</i>,
        Matthew Purdy or Matthew L. Wald, Don Van Natta Jr., reporters
        for the <i>New York Times</i>, or Pat Milton, wire reporter for
        the Associated Press -- as being able to tell us anything useful
        about the facts in this matter. Neither would you allow us to
        accept Robert E. Francis, Vice Chairman of the NTSB, Joseph
        Cantamessa Jr., Special Agent In Charge of the New York Office
        of the F.B.I., Dr. Charles Wetli, Suffolk County Medical
        Examiner, the Pathologist examining the bodies, nor unnamed Navy
        divers, crash investigators, or other cited officials, including
        Boeing Aircraft representatives a part of the crash
        investigative team -- as a qualified party in this matter, and
        thus, dismisses this material out of hand. Good logic, -- about
        as good as saying 150 eye witnesses aren't qualified. Then you
        demand us to produce evidence which you know is not accessible
        to us, evidence held by FBI, whom we accuse of cover up. Thus,
        only YOU are qualified to tell us what to believe? Witnesses be
        damned? Radar tracks be damned? Satellite tracks be damned?
        Reporters be damned? Photographs be damned? Government
        statements be damned? Is there a pattern here?. Why do you
        refuse to address the issues by use of such disinformation
        tactics (rule 19 - ignore proof presented, demand impossible
        proofs)?' </p>
      <p><b>(20) <i>False Evidence</i> ~</b> Whenever possible,
        introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to
        conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to
        neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works
        best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the
        purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the
        fabrications. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Jack Ruby warned the Warren Commission that the
        white Russian separatists, the Solidarists, were involved in the
        assassination. This was a handy 'confession', since Jack and
        Earl were both on the same team in terms of the cover up, and
        since it is now known that Jack worked directly with CIA in the
        assassination (see below.) </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: This one can be difficult to respond to
        unless you see it clearly, such as in the following example,
        where more is known today than earlier in time... 'You are
        avoiding the issue with disinformation tactics. Your information
        is known to have been designed to side track this issue. As
        revealed by CIA operative Marita Lorenz under oath offered in
        court in E. Howard Hunt vs. Liberty Lobby, CIA operatives E.
        Howard Hunt, James McCord, and others, met with Jack Ruby in
        Dallas the night before the assassination of JFK to distribute
        guns and money. Clearly, Ruby was a coconspirator whose
        'Solidarist confession' was meant to sidetrack any serious
        investigation of the murder AWAY from CIA. Why do you refuse to
        address the issues by use of such disinformation tactics (rule
        20 - false evidence)?' </p>
      <p><b>(21) <i>Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or Other
            Empowered Investigative Body</i> ~</b> Subvert the (process)
        to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues
        without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and
        testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For
        instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a
        Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is
        sealed an unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a
        favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered
        officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find
        the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges
        when seeking to frame a victim. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: According to one OK bombing Federal Grand Juror
        who violated the law to speak the truth, jurors were, contrary
        to law, denied the power of subpoena of witness of their
        choosing, denied the power of asking witnesses questions of
        their choosing, and relegated to hearing only evidence
        prosecution wished them to hear, evidence which clearly seemed
        fraudulent and intended to paint conclusions other than facts
        actually suggested. </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: There is usually no adequate response
        to this tactic except to complain loudly at any sign of its
        application, particularly with respect to any possible cover up.
        This happened locally in Oklahoma, and as a result, a new Grand
        Jury has been called to rehear evidence that government
        officials knew in advance that the bombing was going to take
        place, and a number of new facts which indicate it was
        impossible for Timothy McVeigh to have done the deed without
        access to extremely advanced explosive devices such as available
        ONLY to the military or intelligence community, such as CIA's
        METC technology. Media has refused to cover the new Oklahoma
        Grand Jury process, by they way. </p>
      <p><b>(22) <i>Manufacture a New Truth</i> ~</b> Create your own
        expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing
        ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative,
        or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In
        this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so
        authoritatively. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: The False Memory Syndrome Foundation and
        American Family Foundation and American and Canadian Psychiatric
        Associations fall into this category, as their founding members
        and/or leadership include key persons associated with CIA Mind
        Control research. Read The Professional Paranoid or Phsychic
        Dictatorship in the U.S.A. by Alex Constantine for more
        information. Not so curious, then, that (in a perhaps
        oversimplified explanation here) these organizations focus on,
        by means of their own "research findings", that there is no such
        thing as Mind Control. </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: Unless you are in a position to be well
        versed in the topic and know of the background and relationships
        involved in the opponent organization, you are not well equipped
        to fight this tactic. </p>
      <p><b>(23) <i>Create Bigger Distractions</i> ~ </b>If the above
        does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues,
        or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such
        as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to
        distract the multitudes. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: To distract the public over the progress of a
        WTC bombing trial that seems to be uncovering nasty ties to the
        intelligence community, have an endless discussion of skaters
        whacking other skaters on the knee. To distract the public over
        the progress of the Waco trials that have the potential to
        reveal government sponsored murder, have an O.J. summer. To
        distract the public over an ever disintegrating McVeigh trial
        situation and the danger of exposing government involvements,
        come up with something else (Flight 800?) to talk about -- or,
        keeping in the sports theme, how about sports fans shooting
        referees and players during a game and the focusing on the whole
        gun control thing? </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: The best you can do is attempt to keep
        public debate and interest in the true issues alive and point
        out that the 'news flap' or other evasive tactic serves the
        interests of your opponents. </p>
      <p><b>(24) <i>Silence Critics</i> ~</b> If the above methods do
        not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by
        some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is
        removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and
        detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by
        release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them
        financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: As experienced by certain proponents of
        friendly fire theories with respect to flight 800 -- send in FBI
        agents to intimidate and threaten that if they persisted further
        they would be subject to charges of aiding and abetting Iranian
        terrorists, of failing to register as a foreign agents, or any
        other trumped up charges. If this doesn't work, you can always
        plant drugs and bust them. </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: You have three defensive alternatives
        if you think yourself potential victim of this ploy. One is to
        stand and fight regardless. Another is to create for yourself an
        insurance policy which will point to your opponents in the event
        of any unpleasantness, a matter which requires superior
        intelligence information on your opponents and great care in
        execution to avoid dangerous pitfalls (see The Professional
        Paranoid by this author for suggestions on how this might be
        done). The last alternative is to cave in or run (same thing.) </p>
      <p><b>(25) <i>Vanish</i> ~</b> If you are a key holder of secrets
        or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is
        getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. </p>
      <p><i>Example</i>: Do a Robert Vesco and retire to the Caribbean.
        If you don't, somebody in your organization may choose to vanish
        you the way of Vince Foster or Ron Brown. </p>
      <p><i>Proper response</i>: You will likely not have a means to
        attack this method, except to focus on the vanishing in hopes of
        uncovering it was by foul play or deceit as part of a deliberate
        cover up. </p>

      <center><b><font size="+2">Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist</font></b>
        <br>
        by <b>H. Michael Sweeney</b> &lt;HMS@proparanoid.com&gt; <br>
        copyright (c) 1997, 2000 All rights reserved</center>
      <p><b>(1) <i>Avoidance</i> ~</b> They never actually discuss
        issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding
        citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply
        this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their
        presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the
        matter without any further justification for credibility. </p>
      <p><b>(2) <i>Selectivity</i> ~</b> They tend to pick and choose
        opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach
        against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing
        heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly
        address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with
        any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as
        well. </p>
      <p><b>(3) <i>Coincidental</i> ~</b> They tend to surface suddenly
        and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with
        no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in
        the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to
        vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were
        likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish
        with the reason. </p>
      <p><b>(4) <i>Teamwork</i> ~</b> They tend to operate in
        self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course,
        this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will
        likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort
        where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players
        will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw
        man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation
        strength. </p>
      <p><b>(5) <i>Anti-Conspiratorial</i> ~</b> They almost always
        have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those
        who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself
        why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they
        focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on
        conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to
        make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the
        group they hold in such disdain. Or, one might more rightly
        conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going
        out of their way to focus as they do. </p>
      <p><b>(6) <i>Artificial Emotions</i> ~</b>&nbsp; An odd kind of
        'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an
        ability to persevere and persist even in the face of
        overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from
        intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning
        the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally
        involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is
        that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in
        anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout
        their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble
        maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to
        pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional
        communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem
        unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a
        communications medium as they might be able in a real
        face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright
        rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger
        later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being
        thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing
        their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo
        patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it
        is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual
        who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their
        communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give
        up. </p>
      <p><b>(7) <i>Inconsistent</i> ~</b> There is also a tendency to
        make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may
        stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat
        'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for
        the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they
        will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes
        itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to
        be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills
        (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a
        grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots
        who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of
        a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand
        knowledge of it. </p>
      <p><b>(8) <i>Time Constant</i> ~</b> Recently discovered, with
        respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are
        three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the
        government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up
        operation: (1) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth
        can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other
        empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and
        watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A
        NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED
        FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. (2) When
        dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as
        email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of
        a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on
        response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get
        permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command. (3)
        In the NG example (1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that
        bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay
        -- the team approach in play. This is especially true when the
        targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more
        important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a
        serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. </p>
      <p>I close with the first paragraph of the introduction to my
        unpublished book, <i>Fatal Rebirth</i>: </p>
      <p>Truth cannot live on a diet of secrets, withering within
        entangled lies. Freedom cannot live on a diet of lies,
        surrendering to the veil of oppression. The human spirit cannot
        live on a diet of oppression, becoming subservient in the end to
        the will of evil. God, as truth incarnate, will not long let
        stand a world devoted to such evil. Therefore, let us have the
        truth and freedom our spirits require... or let us die seeking
        these things, for without them, we shall surely and justly
        perish in an evil world. </p>
