    <blockquote>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b><br>
            America</b> has been fighting the so-called Drug War ever
          since President Nixon cursed the nation with his declaration
          in 1971. It has been to little avail, because the Drug War
          cannot be won. Instead, the institutionalized national
          psychosis known as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
          has turned the USA into a police state.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Intoxication is a basic
          drive in the animal world. It cannot be suppressed without
          generating psychotic consequences. The eminent
          psychopharmacologist Ronald K. Siegal, Jr. (UCLA) presented
          the case for natural drug use in his study of <i>Intoxication:
Life

            in Pursuit of Paradise</i> (1989):</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Recent ethological and
          laboratory studies with colonies of rodents and islands of
          primates, and analyses of social and biological history,
          suggest that the pursuit of intoxication with drugs is a
          primary motivational force in the behavior of organisms. Our
          nervous system, like those of rodents and primates, is
          arranged to respond to chemical intoxicants in much the same
          way it responds to rewards of food, drink, and sex. Throughout
          our entire history as a species, intoxication has functioned
          like the basic drives of hunger, thirst or sex, sometimes
          overshadowing all other activities in life. Intoxication is
          the fourth drive. We have become the most eager and reckless
          explorers of intoxication."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It behooves us to cultivate
          our abilities and realize our potential --- not necessarily
          without drugs, as prohibitionists would have it. However, that
          lesson cannot be learned by denying us freedom of choice. Our
          dysfunctional drug laws punish natural exploratory behavior
          and forbid us from testing our character in the mirror of
          psychedelic molecules. Prohibition is unconstitutional, and it
          is utterly ineffective. Illicit drugs are readily available to
          almost anyone who wants them, especially among youths, and
          even in prison, where guards are dealers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Laws against drugs are
          predicated on the false assumption that all drug use is
          harmful. Actually, few drugs are truly addictive when used in
          moderation, and most people simply will not allow themselves
          to become addicted. Instead, they use other forms of
          compulsive behavior (religion, sex, love, politics, money,
          work, sports, TV, gambling, etc.) to produce altered states of
          consciousness; some claim to be happy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prohibitionists take the
          process several steps farther; they get their kicks by
          trampling on the rights of others. Indeed, as the British M.P.
          Walter Elliot observed in 1920, Americans are "the barbarians
          of the West" because of their "extraordinary savage idea of
          stamping out all people who happen to disagree... with their
          social theories" about alcohol and other intoxicants.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">People use and abuse any and
          all substances in their search for reality or fantasy. Most
          societies and individuals choose their poisons (alcohol,
          tobacco, cannabis, coffee, cocaine, opium, Prozac, etc.) for
          arbitrary moral or traditional reasons. Thus they determine
          what is a "good", "bad", legal or illicit drug. Otherwise, as
          Dr. Andrew Weil put it, "There are no good or bad drugs; there
          are only good or bad relationships with drugs".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The distinctions between
          legal and illicit drugs are purely ritualistic, magical
          attributes with little or no basis in pharmacology.
          Religionists fear magic and drugs, so they cannot be realistic
          about the issue, especially since they are blind to the facts.
          There's just no arguing with taste. Indeed, as Fred Nietzsche
          observed, "Alcohol and Christianity are the two great European
          narcotics". Karl Marx expressed the same general idea in a
          similar pertinent aphorism: "Religion is the opium of the
          people".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The entire sad spectacle of
          the Drug War is mere superstitious scapegoating. The scapegoat
          is a sacrificial victim (animal or human), heaped upon with
          the sins and other failures of the people. The wretched
          creature is banned into the wilderness, or condemned to death.
          In ancient Greece, the sacrificial human was called <i>pharmakoi</i>
          (remedy), from which are derived the terms pharmacology,
          pharmacy, etc. The Greeks abandoned the practice circa 600 BC,
          after which <i>pharmakoi </i>assumed its modern meaning.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Today, we exercise the
          custom of <i>pharmakoi</i> in the form of draconian laws by
          which drug users and dealers are ostracized or quarantined as
          if they were diseased. Through the skillful abuse of language,
          prohibition propagandists portray drugs as a virus; no one is
          immune to the plague of pleasure and self-destruction, and
          there is no cure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fortunately, education is a
          powerful prophylactic against such quackery. Plato
          warned&nbsp; that, "Complacent ignorance is the most lethal
          sickness of the soul". Truly, knowledge is the only therapy
          for the deadly stupidity caused by anti-drug propaganda. With
          knowledge and self-control we can meet the challenge and
          carefully explore the dimensions revealed by psychoactive
          substances.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thomas Jefferson and Dr.
          Benjamin Rush (who was George Washington’s personal physician
          and a signer of the Declaration of Independence) both foresaw
          that the federal government might someday attempt to control
          medicine. Dr. Rushgave gave this diagnosis:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Unless we put medical
          freedom into the Constitution, the time will come when
          medicine will organize into an underground dictatorship... To
          restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal
          privileges to others will constitute the Bastille of medical
          science. All such laws are un-American and despotic and have
          no place in a republic... The Constitution of this republic
          should make special privilege for medical freedom as well as
          religious freedom."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thomas Jefferson offered a
          second opinion:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"If people let the
          government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they
          take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the
          souls who live under tyranny."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The foresight of Jefferson
          and Rush has proven true, and the problem appears to be
          terminally cancerous. Medical tyranny pervades modern society
          in such various forms as national health care programs, the
          FDA and DEA, and the heinous Drug War.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prohibition is a complete
          failure. The Drug War actually is controlled chaos, serving
          the interests of an "underground dictatorship" while it
          forbids us from the pursuit of happiness --- particularly in
          the form of Cannabis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The federal government of
          the USA uses the phony Drug War as its primary excuse for
          "necessary" abridgements of our rights. It has abandoned the
          Constitution and surrendered to the Communist model of
          suppression by imposing pre-trial detention without bail,
          mandatory minimum prison sentences, and capitol punishment for
          drug crimes, plus increased fines, forfeitures and asset
          seizures, "good faith" exceptions to the exclusionary rule,
          and other aberrant violations of justice. Stoned military
          forces are used to enforce civilian law and to interdict
          suspected smugglers at sea and in the air. Intelligence
          agencies smuggle huge quantities of cocaine and heroin from
          Asia and South America into the USA, and operate clandestine
          laboratories to finance their crimes. Entire governments have
          been toppled by cocaine (Bolivia, Panama, Bahamas, etc.).
          Civilians are required to submit to unreliable drug tests to
          gain employment. Obnoxious currency controls supposedly
          prevent the laundering of drug money, and so on. In short,
          America has become a police state because of its insane drug
          laws and cowardly citizens. Perhaps we have gotten the
          government we deserve. Certainly we have proven that, "None
          are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe
          they are free" (Goethe).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Drug War is perpetuated
          by totalitarians for no other true reason than their lust for
          power. Human rights and truth are irrelevant to them. Instead,
          their propaganda has generated an unwarranted fear of drugs
          that terrorizes hundreds of millions of ignorant people.
          Consequently, most Americans have surrendered their divine
          rights to an unaccountable government. This fraud is nothing
          new, as William Pitt observed in a speech before the British
          House of Commons (1783):</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Necessity is the plea for
          every infringement of human freedom. It is the argument of
          tyrants; it is the creed of slaves."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thomas Jefferson wrote and
          said that, "No self-respecting person would ever want to
          control another one".</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Given that is true, then our
          pathetic government is suffering from extremely low
          self-esteem. America is supposed to be a government of, for
          and by the people, but we have failed completely in our duty
          to defend freedom, our rights, and ourselves from the
          prohibitionist traitors among us. We have sold ourselves into
          slavery "down the river".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Drug War is a <i>coup
            d’etat</i>. The Drug War is not being fought against
          molecules; it is against liberty. The Drug War is conquering
          America law by law, right by right, until nothing will remain
          but to fight the Second Civil War foreseen by George
          Washington and several other American prophets. The Drug War
          is a fraud that has cost Americans their civil rights, over
          250 billion tax dollars, and at least 100 million man-years
          spent in prisons, in futile, corrupt law enforcement, and
          other associated costs including countless deaths at home, in
          the streets, and abroad.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The real issue is Freedom.
          Our fear was spawned by self-deceit; now it lies exposed in
          the light of truth. Now, as Albert Camus put it, "Let us
          rejoice as men because a prolonged hoax has collapsed and we
          see clearly what threatens us".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fred Nietzsche wrote in <i>Ecce

            Homo</i>, "When one wants to get rid of an insupportable
          pressure, one needs hashish". Today, that "insupportable
          pressure" is the federal government of the USA. We live in
          unmanly fear of our government. We have been rendered dumb and
          stupid by an open conspiracy that suckles on us like a
          vampire, eats our children, and aborts our birthrights.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Roger Q. Mills made a speech
          against prohibition in 1887, including the following
          passionate passage, which was quoted again and again during
          the debate in Congress (December 1918):</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Prohibition was introduced
          as a fraud; it has been nursed as a fraud. It is wrapped in
          the livery of Heaven, but it comes to serve the devil. It
          comes to regulate by law our appetites and our daily lives. It
          comes to tear down liberty and build up fanaticism, hypocrisy,
          and intolerance. It comes to confiscate by legislative decree
          the property of many of our fellow citizens. It comes to send
          spies, detectives, and informers into our homes; to have us
          arrested and carried before courts and condemned to fines and
          imprisonments. It comes to dissipate the sunlight of
          happiness, peace, and prosperity in which we are now living
          and to fill our land with alienations, estrangements, and
          bitterness. It comes to bring us evil --- only evil --- and
          that continually. Let us rise in our might as one and
          overwhelm it with such indignation that we shall never hear of
          it again as long as grass grows and water runs."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Abraham Lincoln is
          attributed with this statement (8 December 1840):</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Prohibition... goes beyond
          the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a man’s
          appetite by legislation and makes a crime out of things that
          are not crimes... A prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
          principles upon which our government was founded."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">President Lincoln also
          offered this sage opinion:"These rights are inherent and
          inalienable, that they can never be surrendered or alienated,
          but by idiots or madmen, and all the acts of idiots and
          lunatics are void, and not obligatory, by all the laws of God
          and man..."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Samuel Adams asserted the
          truth of the matter in no uncertain terms: "If men, through
          fear, fraud or mistake, should in terms renounce or give up
          any essential natural right, the eternal law of reason and the
          grand end of society would absolutely vacate such
          renunciation. The right to freedom being the gift of God
          Almighty, it is not in the power of man to alienate this gift
          and voluntarily become a slave."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Benjamin Franklin wrote
          likewise in 1755: "They that can give up essential liberty to
          obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor
          safety."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are several legal
          precedent that support the many Americans who refuse to obey
          drug laws. The decision in Maybury vs. Madison (1803) is clear
          enough: "All laws which are repugnant to the Constitution are
          null and void."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to 16 Am Jur 2d
          Sec 177 &amp; 178, the general rule is:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"An unconstitutional
          statute, having the form and name of law, is in reality no
          law, but is wholy void and ineffective for any purpose. It
          imposes no duty, confers no rights, creates no office, bestows
          no power or authority on anyone, affords no protection and
          justifies no acts performed under it. No one is bound to obey
          an unconstitutional statute and no courts are bound to enforce
          it... If any person acts under an unconstitutional statute, he
          does so at his peril and must take the consequences."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If all else fails, we the
          people retain the right to revolution as reserved in the Bill
          of Rights (Articles 9 and 10 implicitly) and as Abe Lincoln
          reminded us:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"This country, with its
          institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit it. Whenever
          they shall grow weary of the existing government they can
          exercise their constitutional right to dismember or overthrow
          it."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cannabis must be made legal.
          This is the first step toward the only viable, conservative
          and constitutional resolution of the drug problem: legalize
          all drugs (with regulatory control of quality, dosage, etc.).
          Thus, Cannabis hemp could very well "save" the nation and the
          world in this crisis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cannabis does not need to be
          controlled, but only to be regulated and cultivated for all
          the values of its fiber, seeds and resin. Yet, instead of
          enjoying the benefits of Cannabis, we suffer for tiny Pyrrhic
          victories in a perpetual civil war. We have been convinced by
          propaganda to repudiate the principles of freedom upon which
          our former rights were founded.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shame on the craven
          Americans who fail themselves and the Bill of Rights! Damn the
          fanatic prohibitionists who deny Cannabis! Assassinate the
          treasonous politicians who cater to such bigots with their
          demagoguery, false arguments, and cruel laws! Hang (with a
          hemp rope) the corrupt judges and prosecutors who enforce
          those evil laws! Those despots have robbed us of our liberty
          to pay for a bankrupt state of mere privilege that threatens
          all life on Earth. They have betrayed the past, the present,
          and the future, life and love, God, and the Constitution.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The continued suppression of
          Cannabis only aggravates a grave injury to society that
          probably will not be healed by legalization in time to prevent
          disaster from other quarters. God forbid that this burning
          issue should become the funeral pyre of freedom! Hemp is sure
          to survive and thrive, whether it is in the victory gardens or
          in the ruins of the USA.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fiber of Cannabis, the
          "True Hemp", is tightly woven into the tapestry of human life.
          Since earliest times, this great plant ally has provided
          people with cordage and fabric, paper, medicine, and
          inspiration. For all the many benefits it bestows, Cannabis
          hemp is a friendship well worth cultivating. Hemp is many
          things to many people, and it is known by hundreds of names.
          Poets and musicians sing its praises, and preachers damn it.
          Executioners hang condemned men with hemp rope, but sailors
          and mountaineers hang onto it for dear life. Doctors prescribe
          it as a versatile medicine, yet prohibitionists proscribe it
          as a poison. Armies and navies make war with hemp, while
          lovers use it as an aphrodisiac. It is the warp of the mind’s
          veil of illusion, and the woof of politicians, who "lead us in
          the manner dogs lead a parade" (Mark Twain). The resinous
          virtue generates real happiness, enlightenment and
          entertainment, equal in quality and worth to the similar joys
          of love, freedom and good health --- and it complements them
          all, and comforts those poor souls who are without such
          blessings. Hemp is a most interesting and paradoxical plant,
          one that defies control and begs understanding. Hemp is one of
          mankind’s best (and few) friends on Earth, yet it is held
          prisoner within its own cells, bound in a Gordian Knot of bad
          laws. Yet again, it is Ariadne’s Thread, a guideline out of

          passions, by which our poor brief lives are led upward out of
