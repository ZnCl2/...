        <p>(14 Sept. 1948)</p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates to whey products and has more particular
        reference to liquid and solid whey products or derivatives and a
        method of making the same. </p>
      <p>An object of the invention is the provision and production of a
        palatable liquid derived from whey and having a controlled
        alcoholic content. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the invention is the provision and
        production of a solid whey product suitable as a culture or
        precipitating agent for expediting the novel method of making
        the unique whey products, clarifying the liquid, and improving
        the flavor and age characteristics of the novel beverage. </p>
      <p>Other objects o the invention will appear from the following
        description which by way of illustration discloses a preferred
        embodiment of the invention. </p>
      <p>Briefly sated, the objects of the invention are attained by
        mixing whey, cane sugar, and yeast together in suitable
        proportions, maintaining the mixture at controlled temperatures
        for definite periods of time, separating the liquid from the
        solids from time to time, and clarifying the liquid. The solids
        referred to hereinafter as residuum are useful, for example, as
        a culture or precipitating agent in the novel method. The liquid
        is useful as an alcoholic beverage which is light green in
        color, has a pleasant taste and bouquet and a mild smoothness.
        It contains no fusel oil, tannic acid, or other harmful
        ingredient. </p>
      <p>By my novel method I have made such a beverage with as little
        as 10% by volume and as much as 69% by volume of alcohol of
        alcohol and traces of fixed and volatile acids, such as lactic
        acid and acetic acid, respectively. In terms of starting
        ingredients the novel whey product consists of the following
        percentages by weight of the indicated ingredients: from 69.31%
        to 90.05% of whey, from 29.46% to 9.01% of cane sugar, and from
        1.23% to 9.94% of yeast culture. While in the foregoing formula
        I have specified cane sugar in the indicated range, I have found
        that other sugar may be employed, and in fact, I have made the
        novel product without adding any sugar. Where no sugar is added,
        a culture is recovered from about the 32nd to about the 45th day
        from a ferment of whey, sugar and yeast, and is added to the
        whey. The range given is not therefore to be considered as
        limitative, but simply as that preferred for economical and
        other reasons. <br>
        The yeast culture just referred to is made of whey, cane sugar,
        and ‘Dyson’s miracle’ yeast or other suitable bakers’ yeast in
        the following percentages by weight: from 5.63% to 19.07% of
        sugar, from 0.56% to 1.43% of yeast, and from 93.81% to 79.50%
        of whey. For example, for each 1000 pounds of whey and 225
        pounds of sugar employed to make the novel whey product, one
        pound of cane sugar, one-tenth pound of the yeast, and one
        gallon of sweet, freshly prepared whey are mixed together and
        the mixture is maintained at about 85 F for about 24 hours to
        form the culture. That temperature may be varied between about
        70 F and about 90 F with consequent variations in time, whereby
        the culture may be made in from about 15 to about 36 hours
        without departing from the spirit of the invention. The stated
        example, however, includes the time and temperature values as
        well as the proportions which are preferred by me. </p>
      <p>The invention, of course, is not limited to any particular
        apparatus, but I have found I convenient to employ a ferment
        tank with a volumetric capacity about one-third greater than the
        total volume of the ingredients employed, whereby to accommodate
        the foam produced during the practice of the novel method. That
        tank is constructed of wood, earthenware, or other non-corrosive
        material, and preferably has an air-tight cover provided with a
        two-thirds removable top. An air vent leads from the center of
        the cover into water. A low speed agitator is arranged in the
        tank and a source of air under pressure communicates with the
        interior of the tank at the bottom thereof for cooperating with
        the agitator and air vent to remove gas and odors from the tank.
        Associated with the tank is a suitable hopper by means of which
        cane sugar is supplied to the interior of the tank. </p>
      <p>Illustrative of the novel method, I employ sweet whey which has
        been freshly separated to remove the fat residuum and drawn off
        immediately after separation from the curds to avoid marked
        acidity. Preferably, some of the sugar, say about 10% by weight
        thereof, is added to the whey to inhibit undue acidification.
        Thereafter the sweetened whey is poured or otherwise delivered
        into the ferment tank described above at about 85 F. To that
        whey, the culture, prepared as already described, is added in
        the tank and the whey and culture are mixed together. The
        balance of the sugar or, in the event none of the sugar has
        previously been added to the whey, all of the sugar is placed in
        the hopper and delivered thereby into the tank over a period of
        about 72 hours, which is the rate at which the yeast culture
        will well consume the sugar without early putrefaction. </p>
      <p>The ingredients are thus mixed in the proportions already
        stated hereinbefore. The mixture is permitted to stand for about
        three and a half months. During that period the temperature is
        controlled and, from time to time, the solid and liquid whey
        products are separated from one another. During the first three
        days, the temperature of the mixture in the tank is maintained
        at about 64 F. It will be understood that some variations in
        temperature will be approximated by ranges of temperature, it
        being understood that, in general, the action is accelerated by
        an increase in temperature, and retarded by decrease in
        temperature. Accordingly, the temperature during the first three
        days may be maintained at from about 58 F to about 72 F. </p>
      <p>Thereafter for about six days, the temperature of the mixture
        in the tank is maintained at about 60 F, of from about 50 F to
        about 66 F. During that time a scummy substance collects at the
        surface and is skimmed off or otherwise removed. The temperature
        is thereafter reduced to from about 45 F to about 50 F. </p>
      <p>On or about the tenth day following the addition of the sugar a
        black crust will be observed. It is removed and upon removal an
        oil-like film will be revealed on the contents of the tank. This
        film is present in the proportion of about one pint of film per
        1000 pounds of the contents of the tank. The film is skimmed off
        or otherwise removed. The remaining liquid is siphoned from the
        tank, leaving a gelatinous or paste-like residuum which is
        collected and stored at about 50 F. </p>
      <p>The liquid thus siphoned from the tank is placed in a suitable
        container and preferably kept in a dark room, the temperature of
        which is maintained at from about 45 F to about 50 F. The next
        10 days to 45 days, i.e., from 20 to 45 days after delivery of
        the sugar into the ferment tank, may be termed the flavor
        period. At about the 50th day after the sugar is added to the
        whey-culture mixture, a gelatinous or paste-like residuum is
        separated from the liquid and stored with the previously
        collected residuum and under the same conditions as already
        described above. The resulting liquid is dark brown and cloudy,
        palatable and nutritious, but is not stable. It is like sherry
        or sauterne wine. </p>
      <p>At this stage of the novel method the flavor is set or fixed so
        as to be retained in the final product. I fix the flavor in the
        whey product by controlling the quantity of cane sugar and the
        time and temperature during and under which the mixture of whey,
        sugar and yeast is treated. The dark brown liquid is, for
        example, subjected to a low temperature in the order of –10 F
        and that temperature is maintained for at least four days. If a
        lower temperature is employed, somewhat less time is required to
        fix the flavor. To illustrate fixing, for example, one desirable
        flavor, I employ three pounds of cane sugar for each ten pounds
        of whey and deliver the sugar into the mixture of whey and
        culture over a period of about two and a half days at 70 F. On
        about the 25th day thereafter, the desired flavor will be at its
        optimum value, whereupon the mixture is subjected to the
        mentioned low temperature for about four days to fix or set that
        flavor. </p>
      <p>Such fixing of the desired flavor is also accomplished by frost
        extraction of water in the form of ice when the desired flavor
        is at its optimum value. As is well-known in the art, frost
        extraction is accomplished at sufficiently low temperatures to
        solidify the water in the material and by separating the ice
        therefrom to any desired extent. Besides fixing the desired
        flavor, the frost extraction of water result in a greater
        alcoholic content with respect to the other ingredients. Frost
        extraction may be employed at this stage or subsequently to
        remove water from the liquid whereby to increase the proportion
        of alcohol with reference to the other ingredients in the novel
        product. In this manner the alcoholic content of the beverage
        can be varied and the beverage provided with the desired proof
        spirit beverage of alcohol without destroying the vitamin
        content. </p>
      <p>Following the flavor period there is an indefinite lag or aging
        period during which no apparent action is taking place. The
        liquid becomes increasingly bitter and finally marked bubbling
        or ebullition occurs. The liquid is in a glossy turbulent state
        characterized by a soap-like slipperiness with milky bubbles
        resembling soap bubbles. Hence I call this stage
        ‘saponification’. The temperature of the liquid rises. For
        example, if the room containing the vat or vessel of liquid is
        at 50 F, the temperature of the liquid will rise to about 70 F
        and the action will occur at temperatures as low as –30 F. The
        action continues for about 8 days during four of which it is at
        pitch and is completed at about two and one-half months from the
        time the sugar is added to the whey culture mixture. Suddenly
        the action subsides. </p>
      <p>Examination reveals a wax-like surface over a liquid having a
        gelatinous mass immersed therein. The wax-like covering is
        removed and the liquid is separated as before from the
        gelatinous mass which is stored with the residuum previously
        collected as already explained. The liquid is clear and dark
        green in color, palatable and is suitable for flavoring ice
        cream and produces therein an agreeable smoothness of texture.
        At this stage the liquid is very stable and will retain the
        foregoing properties for a period of up to six weeks and
        thereafter becomes unstable, and flocculates. </p>
      <p>For a more desirable and stable product, however, the dark
        green liquid is placed in a suitable container at from about 45
        F to about 50 F and is maintained at that temperature for about
        30 additional days. During about the first eight days of this
        additional period, visible action occurs: node-, spire-, and
        prism-shaped particles and particles of other shapes appear to
        work upwardly from the bottom, and there appears a yellow
        ferment meeting the description of riboflavin carrier. This
        action is so persistent that it is not interrupted by
        temperatures as low as –30 F. At the end of the eight-day period
        a white glue-like substance settles to the bottom of the
        container and the liquid is separated therefrom by a siphoning
        action. </p>
      <p>During about the next eight days a peculiar, if not unique,
        visible action occurs. In this action, what appears to be a
        continuous thread spins upwardly from the bottom symmetrically,
        tier upon tier, with an unbroken line and with a single
        counter-clockwise rotation, The greater the proof of alcohol in
        the liquid, the more pronounced or remarkable is the action. For
        example, in 25 proof liquid the thread appears to rise about
        one-third the distance from the bottom to the top, and in 40
        proof liquid the thread appears to rise about one-half the
        distance from the bottom to the top. </p>
      <p>The final stage which continues for about eight days follows
        the foregoing action, This final stage is characterized by
        marked effervescence with innumerable small bubbles rising from
        te bottom straight to the top of the liquid and there suddenly
        vanishing. At the end of this action I obtain the finished
        beverage without residuum. </p>
      <p>I have observed that the residua collected and maintained at
        about 50 F portray many of the characteristics as to flavor and
        activity as the liquid and among other uses they may be employed
        to shorten the time required for the practice of the method. The
        removal of the solids, including the residuum at the various
        stages of the novel method, clarifies the beverage and their
        formation may be facilitated by suddenly changing the
        temperature of the mixture at the desired sage or stages. In any
        such procedure the mixture is cooled to any temperature within
        the range from 80 F to 95 F thereupon the mixture is permitted
        to settle at about 50 F before the liquid is siphoned off or
        otherwise removed. The greater the range of temperatures, the
        more effective is the removal of solids. In this manner the milk
        sugar is caused to collect in the residuum in bean-like shapes
        before the 30th day and is removed with the residuum (I do not,
        however, in this method remove the milk sugar), undesirable
        coloring components may be removed, and the components rendering
        the mixture bitter just prior to the ‘saponification’ stage may
        also be removed quickly. The resulting residuum is superior for
        use in making a precipitating agent which, as will hereinafter
        be described, expedites the making of the beverage. </p>
      <p>By using the residuum as a precipitating agent I have found
        that time may be saved in the practice of the novel method and
        the effect of aging may be imparted to the beverage. For
        example, according to my discovery about two parts by volume of
        the residuum are added to about one part by volume of the dark
        green liquid resulting from about two and one-half months after
        the sugar is added to the initial whey-culture mixture and
        thoroughly mixed therewith. This mixture is maintained at a
        temperature of about 50 F for from four to six days. The liquid
        thereupon becomes light green and I proceed from that stage as
        described in connection with the last three stages of the method
        for about 30 additional days to convert this light green liquid
        into the finished beverage, thus saving time. I have also found
        that when the residuum is so employed, its age characteristics
        are imparted to the beverage. The residuum may also be employed
        to improve the flavor and age characteristics and clarity of any
        of the finished beverage which due to errors in the novel method
        has in those respects been impaired. </p>
      <p>This novel whey product made of whey, sugar ad yeast provides a
        palatable, harmless, alcoholic beverage with a variable and
        controllable alcoholic content. I have found it useful not only
        as a beverage, but also as a flavor for ice cream to improve its
        texture. The novel whey product in solid form serves among other
        purposes the purpose of expediting the novel method by which the
        whey product is made. </p>
      <p>While a specific embodiment of the invention&nbsp; has been
        described, it will be understood that the invention is not
        limited to the precise details hereinabove set forth by way of
        illustration, but instead what is claimed and desired to be
        secured by United States Letters Patent is: [Claims not included
