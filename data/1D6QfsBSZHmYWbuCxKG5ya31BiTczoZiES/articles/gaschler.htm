        <p><b>Alois Gaschler</b> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to a
          process of and means for transforming elementary atoms,
          particularly of uranium and thorium with a view to hasten
          their spontaneous disintegration and to increase their
          radioactivity, and the invention consists in subjecting small
          quantities of the metal in a vaporizing chamber to a very high
          pressure and temperature and in subjecting the metal vapor to
          the electrostatic or electrolytic effect of strong, preferably
          direct currents.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Successful experiments have
          been made with an electric energy of about 100
          kilowatt-seconds per gram of uranium or thorium. The electric
          current can be used for heating of the metal as well as for
          the electric splitting up of the atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to generate a very
          high pressure during the heating of the metal and to obviate
          heat and light radiation as far as possible, a thin filament
          of metal, weighing about 1 gram, is placed in a duct in a
          massive block of quartz or granite or other refractory mineral
          insulating substance. The two ends of the filament are
          extended through the block and clamped between two thick metal
          plates which at the same time act as closures for the duct.
          Terminals are provided on the metal plate for connection to
          the electric circuit. The duration of the individual electric
          shocks is generally about 1-2 seconds. After the conclusion of
          the process, the evaporated metal is recovered mechanically or
          chemically and it will be found to be much more radioactive
          than the original substance. This change of property may be
          regarded as due to a transformation of elements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The process can be used for
          the artificial production of radium and meso-thorium, uranium
          X, and thorium X. Other elements than uranium and thorium may
          be subjected to transformation in this manner; for instance,
          mercury may in this manner be turned into gold.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The more the separated metal
          vapor comes into contact with the pole surfaces and the higher
          the electric pressure, the greater is the transformation
          effect. It is advisable, therefore, to employ a heating
          circuit of low voltage and high amperage, and a separate
          electrolyzing circuit of relatively low amperage and very high
          voltage. For this purpose a pair of electrodes having a large
          surface is arranged in the vaporizing chamber and connected to
          the high-pressure circuit which, in order to produce a high
          resistance, includes a Crooke's of Geissler tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When artificial metals are
          to be produced on a large scale, the use of a filament is not
          practicable as it requires too frequent replacement. It is
          therefore better ti supply metallic vapor through a valve into
          the space containing the electric arc and to withdraw it
          therefrom the same way.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having now particularly
          described and ascertained the nature of may said invention and
          in what manner the same is to be performed, I declare that
          what I claim is:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) A process of
          transforming elementary atoms, particularly of uranium and
          thorium, and for producing artificial radium and meso-thorium,
          consisting in subjecting small quantities of the metal in a
          vaporizing chamber to high pressure and temperature and in
          subjecting the separated metal vapor to the electrostatic or
          electrolytic effect of strong, preferably direct current,
          substantially as set forth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) A process according to
          Claim 1 in which the heating is effected by means of current
          of low voltage and high amperage and the electrostatic or
          electrolytic splitting up of the atoms, by means of a current
          of high voltage and low amperage, electrodes having a large
          surface being employed in the high pressure circuit, the
          metal, in the form of vapor, being supplied to and withdrawn
          from the space containing the electric arc, through the medium
          of a valve.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) A device for carrying
          out the process according to Claim 1, comprising a massive
          block of stone or other mineral insulating substance having a
          duct for the reception of a thin filament of the metal to be
          treated, the duct being closed by metal plates which carry the
          electric terminals and which clamp the projecting ends of the
          filament, substantially as set forth.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The object of this invention
          is to transform materials of relatively low radioactivity into
          materials of relatively high radioactivity and in general to
          increase the radioactivity of such materials.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another object of my
          invention is to increase the radioactivity of uranium and
          thorium.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another object of my
          invnetion os to accelerate to a high degree the very slow
          sprontaneous transformation of uranium and thorium.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In general, in the process
          of my invention, a small quantity of metal to be transformed
          is heated to a high temperature under high pressure in an
          enclsoed chamber. The metallic vapor is dissociated, and is
          exposed either to high electrostatic, unidirectional curents
          at high potentials. The volume of the chamber is usually large
          in proportion to the normal volume of the material to be
          transformed. The currents and high potentials may be employed
          concurrent with the heating step. I have used on the average
          approximately 100 kilowatt seconds of electrical energy to
          produce 1 gram of uranium of thorium.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to produce a very
          high pressure, while heating the metal and to avoid as much as
          possible the loss of energy by the escape of heat, such as
          radiation, the metal is formed into a thin filament weighing
          about 1 gram. The filament is fixed inside a channel formed in
          a mass of insulating material, such as massive quartz,
          granite, steatite or other stone or mineral. The two ends of
          the filament are attached to two large metallic disks which
          act also as closing means for the channel. These disks bear
          clamps to which leads for the source of current may be
          attached. The duration of the current is usually 1-2 seconds.
          After cooling the metal may be regained either by mechnaical
          or chemical means.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tested by different methods
          the product obtained proves to be considerably more
          radioactive than the product before transformation. This
          process can also be applied to the rational transformation of
          other elements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The efficiency of the
          transformation is all the greater the higher the potential of
          the current. The efficiency is also higher, the more the
          dissociated vapor comes in contact with the pole faces. In
          operating this process it is advisable therefore to employ not
          only a heating current of low voltage and high intensity but
          also a current of small intensity and high voltage. It is
          therefore advisable to insert into the chamber a second pair
          of electrodes of large surface which is connected to a high
          tension circuit. A Crooks tube and a rectifier tube may be
          empoyed in this circuit as a high tension resistance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operating on a large
          scale, instead of using metallic filaments, the metal to be
          transformed is introduced into the chamber containing the
          electric arc via a valve and is also removed from this chamber
          via a valve.</font> </p>

          out my process.</font> </p>
