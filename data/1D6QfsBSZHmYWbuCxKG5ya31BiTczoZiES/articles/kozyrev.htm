    <blockquote>
      <p>Time is the most important and most enigmatic property of
        nature. The concept of time surpasses our imagination. The
        recondite attempts to understand the nature of time by the
        philosophers of antiquity, the scholars in the Middle Ages, and
        the modern scientists, possessing a knowledge of sciences and
        the experience of their history, have proven fruitless. Probably
        this occurs because time involves the most profound and
        completely unknown properties of the world which can scarcely be
        envisaged by the bravest flight of human fancy. Past these
        properties of the world there passes the triumphal procession of
        modern science and technical progress. In reality, the exact
        sciences negate the existence in time of any other qualities
        other than the simplest quality of "duration" or time intervals,
        the measurement of which is realized in hours. This quality of
        time is similar to the spatial interval. The theory of
        relativity by Einstein made this analogy more profound,
        considering time intervals and space as components of a
        4-dimensional interval of a Minkowski universe. Only the
        pseudo-Euclidian nature of the geometry of the Minkowski
        universe differentiates the time interval from the space
        interval. Under such a conception, time is scalar and quite
        passive. It only supplements the spatial arena, against which
        the events of the universe are played out. Owing to the
        scalarity of time, in the equations of theoretical mechanics the
        future is not separated from the past; hence, the causes are not
        separated from the results. In the result, classical mechanics
        brings to the universe a strictly deterministic, but deprived,
        causality. At the same time, causality comprises the most
        important quality of the real world. </p>
      <p>The concept of causality is the basis of natural science. The
        natural scientist is convinced that the question "why" is a
        legitimate one, that a question can be found for it. However,
        the content of the exact sciences is much more impoverished. In
        the precise sciences, the legitimate question is only "how?":
        i.e., in what manner a given chain of occurrences takes place.
        Therefore, the precise sciences are descriptive. The description
        is made in a 4-dimensional world, which signifies the
        possibility of predicting events. This possibility of prediction
        is the key to the power of the precise sciences. The fascination
        of this power is so great that it often compels one to forget
        the basic, incomplete nature of their basis. It is therefore
        probable that the philosophical concept of Mach, derived
        strictly logically from the bases of the exact sciences,
        attracted great attention, in spite of its nonconformity to our
        knowledge concerning the universe and daily experience. </p>
      <p>The natural desire arises to introduce into the exact science
        the principles of natural sciences. In other words, the tendency
        is to attempt to introduce into theoretical mechanics the
        principle of causality and directivity of time. Such a mechanics
        can be called "causal" or "asymmetrical" mechanics. In such
        mechanics, there should be realizable experience, indicating
        where the cause is and where the result is. It can be
        demonstrated that in statistical mechanics there is a
        directivity of time and that it satisfies our desires. In
        reality, statistical mechanics constructs a certain bridge
        between natural and theoretical mechanics. In the statistical
        grouping, an asymmetrical state in time can develop, owing to
        unlikely initial conditions caused by the direct intervention of
        a proponent of the system, the effect of which is causal. If,
        subsequently, the system will be isolated, in conformity with
        the second law of thermodynamics, its entropy will increase, and
        the directivity of time will be associated with this trend in
        the variation of entropy. As a result, the system will lead to
        the most likely condition; it will prove to be in equilibrium,
        but then the fluctuations in the entropy of various signs will
        be encountered with equal frequency. Therefore, even in the
        statistical mechanics of an isolated system, under the most
        probable condition, the directivity of time will not exist. It
        is quite natural that in statistical mechanics, based on the
        conventional mechanics of a point, the directivity of time does
        not appear as a quality of time itself but originates only as a
        property of the state of the system. If the directivity of time
        and other possible qualities are objective, they should enter
        the system of elementary mechanics of isolated processes.
        However, the statistical generalization of such mechanics can
        lead to a conclusion concerning the unattainability of
        equilibrium conditions. In reality, the directivity of time
        signifies a pattern continuously existing in time, which, acting
        upon the material system, can cause it to transfer to an
        equilibrium state. Under such a consideration, the events should
        occur not only in time, as in a certain arena, but also with the
        aid of time. Time becomes an active participant in the universe,
        eliminating the possibility of thermal death. Then, we can
        understand harmony of life and death, which we perceive as the
        essence of our world. Already, owing to these possibilities
        alone, one should carefully examine the question as to the
        manner in which the concept of the directivity of time or its
        pattern can be introduced into the mechanics of elementary
        processes. </p>
      <p>We shall represent mechanics in the simplest form, as the
        classical mechanics of a point or a system of material points.
        Desiring to introduce thus into mechanics the principle of
        causality of natural science, we immediately encounter the
        difficulty that the idea of causality has not been completely
        formulated in natural science. In the constant quests for
        causes, the naturalist is guided rather by his own intuition
        than by fixed procedures. We can state only that causality is
        linked in the closest way with the properties of time,
        specifically with the difference in the future and the past.
        Therefore, we will be guided by the following hypothesis: </p>
      <p>I. Time possesses a quality, creating a difference in causes
        from effects, which can be evoked by directivity or pattern.
        This property determines the difference in the past from the
        future. </p>
      <p>The requirement for this hypothesis is indicated by the
        difficulties associated with the development of the Liebnitz
        idea concerning the definition of the directivity of time
        through the causal relationships. The profound studies by H.
        Reichenbach [1] and G. Withrow [2] indicate that one can never
        advance this idea strictly, without tautology. Causality
        provides us with a concept of the existence of the directivity
        of time and concerning certain properties of this directivity;
        at the same time, it does not constitute the essence of this
        phenomenon, but only its result. </p>
      <p>Let us now attempt, utilizing the simplest properties of
        causality, to provide a quantitative expression of hypothesis I.
        Proceeding from those circumstances in which: 1) cause is always
        outside of the body in which the result is realized and 2) the
        result set in after the cause, we can formulate the next two
        axioms: </p>
      <p>II. Causes and results are always separated by space.
        Therefore, between them there exists an arbitrarily small, but
        not equaling zero, spatial difference d<sub>x</sub>. </p>
      <p>III. Causes and results are separated in time. Therefore,
        between their appearance there exists an arbitrarily small, but
        not equaling zero, time difference d<sub>t</sub> of a fixed
        sign. </p>
      <p>Axiom II forms the basis of classical Newtonian mechanics. It
        is contained in a third law, according to which a variation in a
        quantity of motion cannot occur under the effect of external
        forces. In other words, in a body there cannot develop an
        external force without the participation of another body. Hence,
        based on the impenetrability of matter, d<sub>s</sub>¹ <strike>=/</strike>
        0. However, on the basis of the complete reversibility of time,
        axiom III is lacking in the Newtonian mechanics: d<sub>t</sub>=
        0. </p>
      <p>In atomic mechanics, just the opposite takes place. In it, the
        principle of impenetrability loses its value and, based on the
        possibility of the superposition of fields, it is obviously
        assumed that dx = 0. However, in atomic mechanics there is a
        temporal irreversibility, which did not exist in the Newtonian
        mechanics. The influence upon the system of a macroscopic body.
        I.e., they devise, introduces a difference between the future
        and the past, because the future proves predictable, while the
        past is not. Therefore, in the temporal environs of the
        experiment, dt¹ = 0, although is can be arbitrarily small. In
        this manner, classical mechanics and atomic mechanics enter into
        our axiomatics as two extreme systems. This circumstance becomes
        especially clear if we introduce the relationship: </p>
      <p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx / dt = C<sub>2</sub> </p>
      <p>In a real world, C<sub>2 </sub>most likely constitutes a
        finite value. However, in classical mechanics, dx¹ <strike>=/&nbsp;</strike>
        0 , dt = 0 , and hence C<sub>2 </sub>= infinity. In atomic
        mechanics, dx = 0, dt ¹ <strike>=/</strike> 0, and therefore C<sub>2
        </sub>= 0. </p>
      <p>Let us now discuss the concept of the symbols dx and dt
        introduced by us. In a long chain of causal-resultant
        transformations, we are considering only that elementary chain
        wherein the cause produces the result. According to the usual
        physical viewpoints, this chain comprises a spatial time point,
        not subject to further analysis. However, on the bases of our
        axioms of causality, this elementary causal-resultant chain
        should have a structure caused by the impossibility of
        spatial-time superimposition of causes and effects. The
        condition of non-superimposition in the case of the critical
        approach is stipulated by the symbols dx and dt. Hence, these
        symbols signify the limit of the infinitely-small values under
        the condition that they never revert to 0. These symbols
        determine the point distances or dimensions of an "empty" point,
        situated between the material points, with which the causes and
        effects are linked. However, in the calculation of the intervals
        of the entire causal-resultant chain, they should be considered
        equal to 0 with any degree of accuracy. However, if they have
        infinitely low values of one order, their ratio C<sub>2 </sub>can





        be a finite value and can express a qualitatively physical
        property of the causal-resultant relationship. This physical
        property is included in the pattern of time, formulated
        qualitatively by hypothesis I. </p>
      <p>In reality, according to definition (I), the value C<sub>2</sub>
        has the dimensionality of velocity and yields a value to the
        rate of the transition of the cause to the effect. This
        transition is accomplished through the "empty" point, where
        there are no material bodies and there is only space and time.
        Hence, the value C<sub>2</sub> can be associated only with the
        properties of time and space, not with the properties of bodies.
        Therefore, C<sub>2</sub> should be a universal constant,
        typifying the pattern of time in our world. The conversion of
        the cause to an effect requires the overcoming of the overcoming
        of the "empty" point in space. This point is an abyss, the
        transition through which can be realized only with the aid of
        the time pattern. From this, there follows directly the active
        participation of time in the processes of the material systems.
      </p>
      <p>In Equation (1), the symbol dt has a definite meaning. It can
        be established by the standard condition: the future minus the
        past comprises a positive value. However, the sign of the value
        for dx is quite arbitrary, since space is isotropic and in it
        there is no principal direction. At the same time, the sign of C<sub>2</sub>
        should be definite, because logically we should have a
        possibility of conceiving the world with an opposite time
        pattern: i.e., of another sign. The difficulty arises which at
        first glance seems insurmountable, and disrupting the entire
        structure formulated until now. However, owing to just this
        difficulty, it becomes possible to make an unequivocal
        conclusion: C<sub>2</sub> is not a scalar value but a
        pseudo-scalar value: i.e., a scalar changing sign in the case of
        the mirror image or inversion of the coordinate system. In order
        to be convinced of this, let us rewrite Equation (1) in a vector
        form, having signified by <i>i</i> the unit vector of the
        direction of the causal-resultant relationship: </p>
      <p>(1a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C<sub>2 </sub>( <i>i </i>dt ) = dx </p>
      <p>If C<sub>2</sub> is pseudo-scalar, <i>i </i>dt should be a
        critical of a pseudo-vector colinear with the critical vector
        dx. The pseudo-vector nature of <i>i </i>dt signifies that in
        the plane (YZ) of a perpendicular to the X-axis there occurs a
        certain turning, the sign of which can be determined by the sign
        of dt. This means that with the aid of dt, we can orient the
        plane perpendicular to the X-axis: i.e., we can allocate the
        arrangement of the Y and Z axes. Let us now alter in Equation
        (1) the sign of dx, retaining the sign of dt and signifying the
        retention of the orientation of the plane (YZ). Then the
        constant C<sub>2</sub> changes its sign, as it should, since our
        operation is tantamount to a mirror image. However, if we change
        the sign not only of dx but also of dt, the constant C<sub>2</sub>
        based on Equation (1) does not change sign. This should be the
        case, because in the given instance we effected only a turning
        of the coordinate system. Finally, changing the sign of dt only,
        we once again obtain a mirror (specular) image of the coordinate
        system under which the sign of the pseudo-scalar should change.
        This proof of the pseudo-scalar property of the time pattern can
        be explained by the following simple discussion. The time
        pattern should be determined in relation to a certain invariant.
        Such an invariant, independent of the properties of matter, can
        be only space. The absolute value of the time pattern is
        obtained when the absolute difference in the future and the past
        will be linked with the absolute difference between right and
        left, although these concepts per se are quite tentative.
        Therefore, the time pattern also should be established by a
        value having the sense of a linear velocity o turning
        (rotation). From this it follows that C<sub>2</sub> cannot equal
        the speed of light C<sub>I</sub> comprising the conventional
        scalar. </p>
      <p>From the pseudo-scalar properties of the time pattern, there
        immediately follows the basic theorem of causal mechanics: </p>
      <p>A world with an opposite time pattern is equivalent to our
        world, reflected in a mirror. </p>
      <p>In a world reflected in a mirror, causality is completely
        retained. Therefore, in a world with an opposite time pattern
        the events should develop just as regularly as in our world. It
        is erroneous to think that, having run a movie film of our world
        in a reverse direction, we would obtain a pattern of the world
        of an opposite time direction. We can in no way formally change
        the sign in the time intervals. This leads to a disruption of
        causality: i.e., to an absurdity, to a world which cannot exist.
        In a variation of the directivity of time, there should also
        become modified the influences which the time pattern exerts
        upon the material system. Therefore, the world reflected in a
        mirror should differ in its physical properties from our world.
        Up until modern times, this identity was assumed in atomic
        mechanics and was said to be the law of the preservation of
        parity. However, these studies by Lie and Young of the nuclear
        processes during weak interactions led to the experiments,
        having demonstrated the erroneous position of this law. This
        result is quite natural under the actual existence of time
        directivity, which is confirmed by direct experiments described
        later. At the same time, one can never make the opposite
        conclusion. Numerous investigations of the observed phenomena of
        the nonpreservation of parity have demonstrated the possibility
        of other interpretations. It is necessary to conclude that
        further experiments in the field of nuclear physics narrow the
        scope of possible interpretations to such an extent that the
        existence of time directivity in the elementary processes will
        become quite obvious. </p>
      <p>The difference in the world from the mirror image is especially
        graphically indicated by biology. The morphology of animals and
        plants provides many examples of asymmetry, distinguishing right
        from left and independently of what hemisphere of the earth the
        organism is living in. Asymmetry of organisms is manifested not
        only in their morphology. The chemical asymmetry of protoplasm
        discovered by Louis Pasteur demonstrates that the asymmetry
        constitutes a basic property of life. The persistent asymmetry
        of organisms being transmitted to their descendants cannot be
        random. This asymmetry cannot only be a passive result of the
        laws of nature, reflecting the time directivity. Most likely,
        under a definite asymmetry, corresponding to the given time
        pattern, an organism acquires an additional viability: i.e., it
        can use it for the reinforcement of life processes. Then, on the
        bases of our fundamental theorem, we can conclude that in a
        world with an opposite time pattern, the heart in the
        vertebrates would be located on the right, the shells of
        mollusks would be mainly turned leftward, and in protoplasm
        there would be observed an opposite qualitative inequality of
        the right and left molecules. It is possible that the specially
        formulated biological experiments will be able to prove directly
        that life actually uses the time pattern as an additional source
        of energy. </p>
      <p>Let us now comment on yet another important circumstance,
        connected with the determination of the time pattern by Equation
        (1). Each causal-resultant relationship has a certain spatial
        direction, the base vector of which is signified by <i>i</i>.
        Therefore, in an actual causal relationship the pseudo-scalar <i>i
          <sup>.</sup> </i>C<sub>2</sub> will be oriented by the time
        pattern. Let us prove that at one point -- the cause -- and at
        another point -- the result -- these values should be in
        opposite directions. In reality, the result in the future will
        be situated in relation to the cause, while the cause in the
        past will be situated in relation to the result. This means that
        at the points cause and effect dt should have opposite signs,
        meaning that there should also be an opposite orientation of the
        plane perpendicular to <i>i</i>. Then, at a definite <i>i</i>-value
we
have






        a change in the type of the coordinate system, and the
        expression <i>i</i>C<sub>2 </sub>will have different signs.
        However, if during the transition from the cause to the effect
        we have a change in the sign of <i>i</i>, the sign of C<sub>2 </sub>will






        remain unchanged and, hence, <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> will change
        sign in this case also. This means that the time pattern is
        characterized by the values ± <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> and
        constitutes a physical process, the model of which can be the
        relative rotation of a certain ideal top (gyroscope). By an
        ideal gyroscope, we connote a body the entire mass of which is
        located at a certain single distance from the axis. This top can
        have an effect on another body through a material axis of
        rotation and material relationships with this axis, the masses
        of which can be disregarded. Therefore, the mechanical property
        of an ideal gyroscope will be equivalent to the properties of a
        material point having the mass of the gyroscope and its
        rotation. Let us assume that the point with which the top
        interacts is situated along the direction of its axis. Let us
        signify by <i>j</i> the base vector of this direction and
        consider it to be a standard vector. We can tentatively,
        independent of the type of the coordinate system, place it in
        another point: for example, in the direction from which the
        rotation of the top appears to be originating -- in this case,
        in a clockwise direction. The rotation of the top which is
        occurring can be described by the approximate pseudo-scalar <i>ju</i>,
        where <i>u</i> equals the linear velocity of rotation. With
        such a description and the direction selected by us, <i>u</i>
        should be a pseudo-scalar, positive in the left-hand system of
        coordinates. Let us now consider the motion of a point upon
        which the gyroscope axis is acting from the position of the
        point of its rim. Since the distance of this point from the
        plane of the rim is arbitrarily small, its velocity, computed
        from the position of the rim in respect to the radius and the
        period, will be the same value for <i>u</i>. We can draw on a
        sheet of paper the motion of the points of the rim relative to
        the center and to the motion of the center from the position of
        the rim points. The motion is obtained in one direction if we
        examine the paper from the same side: e.g., from above. However,
        the infinitely small emergence of a stationary point from the
        plane of the rim compels us to examine the rotation from another
        position: i.e., to examine the paper from beneath. We obtain a
        rotation in the opposite direction, as a result of which we
        should compare with the gyroscope the approximate pseudo-scalar:
        i.e., <i>ju</i>. This signifies that the time pattern being
        determined by the values ± <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> actually has
        an affinity with the relative rotation, which is determined by
        the values ± <i>ju </i>of the same type. It is understandable
        that this formal analogy does not fully explain the essence of a
        time pattern. However, it opens up the remarkable possibility of
        an experimental study of the properties of time. In reality, if
        into the causal relationship there will enter a rotating body,
        we can expect that in a system with rotation the time pattern
        changes instead of&nbsp; ± <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> : it becomes
        equal to ± ( <i>i</i>C<sub>2 </sub>+ <i>ju</i> ). Let us now
        attempt to explain which variations from this can occur in a
        mechanical system. For this, it is necessary to refine the
        concept of cause and effect in mechanics. </p>
      <p>The forces are the causes altering the mutual arrangement of
        bodies and their quantity of motion. The change in the
        arrangement of bodies can lead to the appearance of new forces,
        and according to the d’Alembert principle, the variation of a
        quantity of motion for unit time, taken with an opposite sign,
        can be regarded as the force of inertia. Therefore, in mechanics
        the forces are comprised of the causes and all possible effects.
        However, in the movement of a body (1) under the effect of force
        F, the force of inertia dp/dt does not constitute a result. Both
        of these forces originate at one point. According to axiom II,
        owing to this there cannot be a causal-resultant relationship
        between them, and they are identical concepts. Therefore, as
        Kirchhoff operated in his mechanics, the force of inertia can
        serve as a determination of the force F. The force F, applied to
        point (1), can evoke an effect only in another point (2). Let us
        call this force of the result the effect F<sub>o</sub> of the
        first point upon the second: </p>
      <p>(2) F<sub>o </sub>= F – dp<sub>1</sub>/df = dp<sub>2 </sub>/dt






      </p>
      <p>For the first point, however, it comprises the lost d’Alembert
        force: </p>
      <p>dp<sub>1</sub>/dt = F - dp<sub>2</sub>/dt </p>
      <p>In conformity with these expressions, we can consider that for
        one time, dt, point (1) loses the pulse dp<sub>2</sub> which is
        transmitted to point (2). In the case for which there is a
        causal relationship between point (1) and (2), dt ¹ <strike>=/</strike>
        0, and between them there exists the approximate difference dp<sub>2</sub>¹
        <strike>=/</strike> 0. When the cause is situated at point (1),
        the transition of dp<sub>2</sub> from point (1) to point (2)
        corresponds to an increase in the time. Therefore: </p>
      <p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dp<sub>2 </sub>/dt = dp<sub>2 </sub>/dt
        = F<sub>o</sub> </p>
      <p>Let us signify by <i>I</i> the unit vector of effect F<sub>o</sub>
        . Then, according to Eq. (3): </p>
      <p>F<sub>o </sub>= <i>i </i>| F<sub>o </sub>| = <i>i </i>|
        dp<sub>2 </sub>| / dt = <i>i </i>| dp<sub>2 </sub>| / dx | <b><sup>.</sup></b>
        | d x 1 / dt </p>
      <p>According to Eq. (1), the value | dx | / dt can be replaced by
        C<sub>2</sub> if we tentatively utilize that system of
        coordinates in which C<sub>2</sub> is positive. </p>
      <p>Under this condition: </p>
      <p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F<sub>o </sub>= <i>i</i>C<sub>2 </sub><b><sup>.</sup></b>|
        dp<sub>2 </sub>/ dx | </p>
      <p>The factor <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> comprises a value independent
        of a time pattern: i.e., a force invariant. In reality, during
        any pattern of time not only the spatial intervals but also the
        time intervals should be measured by the unchanging scales
        [weights]. Therefore, the velocity and, consequently, also the
        pulses should not depend on the pattern (course) of time. As was
        demonstrated above, in case of the existence of a time pattern <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub><b>
        </b>in point (2), there must be in point (1) the time pattern -<i>i</i>C<sub>2
        </sub>. This means that during the effect upon point (2), there
        must be a counter effect or a reaction force R<sub>o</sub> in
        point (1): </p>
      <p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R<sub>o</sub> = -<i> i</i>C<sub>2 </sub>×
        | dp<sub>2 </sub>/ dx&nbsp; | </p>
      <p>Thus, the third Newtonian law proves to be the direct result of
        the properties of causality and pattern of time. The effect and
        the counter effect comprise two facets of the identical
        phenomenon, and between them a time discontinuity cannot exist.
        In this manner, the law of the conservation of a pulse is one of
        the most fundamental laws of nature. </p>
      <p>Let us now assume that the time pattern has varied and, instead
        of ± <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> it has become equal to ± ( <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub>
        + <i>ju</i>). Then, based on Eqs. (4) and (5), the following
        transformation of forces should occur: </p>
      <p>F&nbsp; =&nbsp; ± ( <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> + <i>ju</i>) × | dp<sub>2
        </sub>/ dx |&nbsp; ; R = - ( <i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> + <i>ju</i>)
        ) ×| dp<sub>2&nbsp;</sub> / dx | </p>
      <p>The additional forces are obtained: </p>
      <p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^ F&nbsp; =&nbsp; F&nbsp; -&nbsp; F<sub>o</sub>
        = + <i>j</i> u / C<sub>2</sub>| Fo | <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}






        ^R = R – R<sub>o</sub> = - <i>j</i> u / C<sub>2 </sub>| F<sub>o
        </sub>| <br>
        Thus, in the causal relationship with a spinning top
        (gyroscope), we can expect the appearance of additional forces
        (6) acting along the axis of rotation of the top. The proper
        experiments described in detail in the following section
        indicate that, in reality, during the rotation, forces develop
        acting upon the axis and depending on the time direction. The
        measured value of the additional forces permits us to determine,
        based on Eq. (6), the value of C<sub>2</sub> of the time pattern
        not only in magnitude but also in sign: i.e., to indicate the
        type of the coordinate system in which C<sub>2</sub> is
        positive. <b>It turns out that the time pattern of our world is
          positive in a laevorotary system of coordinates</b>. From
        this, we are afforded the possibility of an objective
        determination of left and right; the left-hand system of
        coordinates is said to be that system in which the time progress
        is positive, while the right-hand system is one in which it is
        negative. In this manner, the time progress linking all of the
        bodies in the world, even during their complete isolation, plays
        the role of that material bridge concerning the need, of which
        gauss (3) has already spoken, for the coordination of the
        concepts of left and right. <br>
        The appearance of additional forces can perhaps be graphically
        represented in the following manner: Time enters a system
        through the cause to the effect. The rotation alters the
        possibility of this inflow, and, as a result, the time pattern
        can create additional stresses in the system. These variations
        produce the time pattern. From this it follows that <b>time has
          energy</b>. Since the additional forces are directed
        oppositely, the pulse of the system does not vary. This
        signifies that time does not have a pulse, although it possesses
        energy. <br>
        In Newtonian mechanics, C<sub>2</sub> = infinity. The additional
        forces according to Eq. (6) disappear, as should occur in this
        mechanics. This is natural because the infinite pattern of time
        can in no way be altered. Therefore, time proves to be an
        imparted fate and invincible force. However, the <b>actual time
          has a finite pattern and can be effective</b>, and this
        signifies that <b>the principle of time can be reversible</b>.
        How, in reality, these effects can be accomplished should be
        demonstrated by experiments studying the properties of time. <br>
        In atomic mechanics, C<sub>2</sub> = 0. Equations (60, obtained
        by a certain refinement of the principles of Newtonian
        mechanics, are approximate and do not give the critical
        transition at C<sub>2</sub> = 0. They only indicate that the
        additional effects not envisaged by Newtonian mechanics will
        play the predominant part. The causality becomes completely
        intertwined (confused) and the occurrences of nature will remain
        to be explained statistically. <br>
        The Newtonian mechanics correspond to a world with infinitely
        stable causal relationships, while atomic mechanics represent
        another critical state of a world with infinitely weak causal
        relationships. Equations (6) indicate that the mechanics
        corresponding to the principles of causality of natural science
        should be developed from the aspect of Newtonian mechanics, and
        not from the viewpoint of atomic mechanics. In this connection,
        there can appear features typical for atomic mechanics. For
        instance, we can expect the appearance of quantum effects in
        macroscopic mechanics. <br>
        The theoretical concepts expounded here are basically necessary
        only in order to know how to undertake the experiments on the
        study of the properties of time. Time represents an entire world
        of enigmatic phenomena, and they can in no way be pursued by
        logical deliberations. The properties of time must be gradually
        explained by physical experiment. <br>
        For the formulation of experiments, it is important to have a
        fore-knowledge of the value of the expected effects, which
        depend upon the value C<sub>2</sub> . We can attempt to estimate
        the numerical value of C<sub>2</sub> , proceeding from the
        dimensionality concepts. The single universal constant which can
        have the meaning of a pseudo-scalar is the Planck constant, <i>h</i>.
        In reality, this constant has the dimensionality of a moment of
        a quantity of motion and determines the spin of elementary
        particles. Now, utilizing the Planck constant in any scalar
        universal constant, it is necessary to obtain a value having the
        dimensionality of velocity. It is easy to establish that the
        expression <br>
        (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C<sub>2</sub> = a <i>e</i>2 <i>/ h</i>
        =&nbsp; a <b><sup>.</sup></b> 350 km/sec <br>
        comprises a unique combination of this type. Here <i>e</i>
        equals the charge of an elementary particle and a equals a
        certain dimensionless factor. Then, based on Eq. (6), at <i>u</i>
        = 100 m/sec, the additional forces will be of the order of 10<sup>-4</sup>
        or 10<sup>-5</sup> (at a considerable a-value) from the applied
        forces. At such a value for C<sub>2</sub> , the forces of the
        time pattern can easily be revealed in the simplest experiments
        not requiring high accuracy of measurements. </p>

              Time, and Basic Findings</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <br>
      The experimental verification of the above-developed theoretical
      concepts was started as early as the winter of 1951-1952. From
      that time, these studies have been carried on continuously over
      the course of a number of years with the active participation by
      graduate student V.G. Labeysh. At the present time, they are
      underway at the laboratory of the Pulkovo Observatory with
      engineer V.V. Nasonov. The work performed by Nasonov imparted a
      high degree of reliability to the experiments. During the time of
      these investigations, we accumulated numerous and diversified
      data, permitting us to form a number of conclusions concerning the
      properties of time. We did not succeed in interpreting all of the
      material, and not all of the material has a uniform degree of
      reliability. Here we will discuss only those data which were
      subjected to a recurrent checking and which, from our viewpoint,
      are completely reliable. We will also strive to form conclusions
      from these data. <br>
      The theoretical concepts indicate that the tests on the study of
      causal relationships and the pattern of time need to be conducted
      with rotating bodies: namely, gyroscopes. The first tests were
      made in order to verify that the law of the conservation of a
      pulse is always fulfilled, and independently of the condition of
      rotation of bodies. These tests were conducted on lever-type
      weights [scales]. At a deceleration of the gyroscope, rotating by
      inertia, its moment of rotation should be imparted to the weights
      [scales], causing an inevitable torsion of the suspensions. In
      order to avert the suspension difficulties associate with this,
      the rotation of the gyroscope should be held constant. Therefore,
      we utilized gyroscopes from aviation automation, the velocity of
      which was controlled by a variable 3-phase current with a
      frequency of the order of 500 cps. The gyroscope’s rotor turned
      with this same frequency. It appeared possible, without decreasing
      significantly the suspension precision, to supply current to the
      gyroscope suspended on weights [scales] with the aid of three very
      thin uninsulated conductors. During the suspension the gyroscope
      was installed in a hermetically sealed box, which excluded
      completely the effect of air currents. The accuracy of this
      suspension was of the order of 0.1-0.2 mg. With a vertical
      arrangement of the axis and various rotation velocities, the
      readings of the weights [scales] remained unchanged. For example,
      proceeding from the data for one of the gyroscopes (average
      diameter D of rotor equals 4.2 cm: rotor weight Q equals 250 gr),
      we can conclude that with a linear rotational velocity u = 70
      m/sec the effective force upon the weights [scales] will remain
      unchanged, with a precision higher than up to the sixth place. In
      these experiments, we also introduced the following interesting
      theoretical complication: The box with the gyroscope was suspended
      from an iron plate, which attracted the electromagnets fastened
      together with a certain mass. This entire system was suspended on
      weights [scales] by means of an elastic band. The current was
      supplied to the electromagnets with the aid of two very thin
      conductors. The system for breaking the current was accomplished
      separately from the weights [scales]. At the breaking of the
      circuit, the box with the gyroscope fell to a clipper fastened to
      the electromagnets. The amplitude of these drops and the
      subsequent rise could reach 2 mm. The test was conducted for
      various directions of suspension and rotation masses of the
      gyroscope, at different amplitudes, and at an oscillation
      frequency ranging from units to hundreds of cps. For a rotating
      gyroscope, just as for a stationary one, the readings of the
      weights [scales] remained unchanged. We can consider that the
      experiments described substantiate fairly well the theoretical
      conclusion concerning the conservation of a pulse in causal
      mechanics. <br>
      In spite of their theoretical interest, the previous experiments
      did not yield any new effects capable of confirming the role of
      causality in mechanics. However, in their fulfillment it was noted
      that in the transmission of the vibrations from the gyroscope to
      the support of the weights [scales} variations in the readings of
      the weights [scales] can appear, depending on the velocity and
      direction of rotation of the gyroscopes. When the vibrations of
      the weights [scales] themselves begin, the box with the gyroscope
      discontinues being strictly a closed system. However, the weights
      [scales} can go out o equilibrium if the additional effect of the
      gyroscope developing from rotation proves to be transferred from
      the shaft of the gyroscopes to the weights’ [scales’] support.
      From these observations, a series of tests with these gyroscopes
      developed. <br>
      In the first type the vibrations were due to the energy of the
      rotor and its pounding in the bearings, depending on the clearance
      in them. It is understandable that the vibrations interfere with
      accurate suspension. Therefore, it was necessary to abandon the
      precision weights [scales] of the analytical type and convert to
      engineering weights [scales], in which the ribs of the prisms
      contact small areas having the form of caps. Nevertheless, in this
      connection we managed to maintain an accuracy of the order of 1 mg
      in the differential measurements. The support areas in the form of
      caps are also convenient by virtue of the fact that with them we
      can conduct the suspension of gyroscopes rotating by inertia. A
      gyroscope suspended on a rigid support can transmit through a yoke
      its vibrations to the support of the weights [scales]. With a
      certain type of vibration, which was chosen completely by feel,
      there occurred a considerable decrease in the effect of the
      gyroscope upon the weights [scales] during its rotation in a
      counterclockwise direction, if we examined it from above. During
      the rotation in a clockwise direction, under the same conditions,
      the readings of the weights [scales] remained practically
      unchanged. Measurements conducted with gyroscopes of varying
      weight and rotor radius, at various angular velocities, indicated
      that a <b>reduction of the weight, in conformity with Eq. (6), is
        actually proportional to the weight and to the linear rate of
        rotation</b>. For example, at a rotation of the gyroscope (D =
      4.6 cm, Q = 90 gr, u = 25 m/sec), we obtained the weight
      difference of -8 mg. With rotation in a clockwise direction, it
      always turned out that [the weight difference] = 0. However, with
      a horizontal arrangement of the axis, in azimuth, we found the
      average value = -4 mg. From this, we can conclude that any
      vibrating body under the conditions of this experiment should
      indicate a reduction in weight. Further studies demonstrated that
      <b>this effect is caused by the rotation of the earth</b>, which
      will be discussed in detail later. Presently, the only fact of
      importance to us is that during the vibration there is developed a
      new zero reading relative to which <b>with a rotation in a
        counterclockwise direction, we obtain a weight reduction, while
        during a rotation in a clockwise direction we obtain a
        completely uniform increase in weight</b> ( <u>+</u> 4 mg). In
      this manner, Eq. (6) is given a complete, experimental
      confirmation. It follows from the adduced data that C<sub>2</sub>
      = 550 km/sec. According to this condition, the vector <i>j</i> is
      oriented in that direction in which the rotation appears to be
      originating in a clockwise direction. This means that during the
      rotation of the gyroscope in a clockwise direction it is directed
      downward. With such a rotation, the gyroscope becomes lighter,
      meaning that its additional effect upon the support of the weights
      is directed downward: i.e., in respect to the base vector <i>j</i>.
      This will obtain in the case in which <i>u</i> and C<sub>2</sub>
      have the same signs. Under our condition relative to the direction
      of the base vector <i>j</i> the pseudo-scalar <i>u</i> is
      positive in a left-hand system of coordinates. Consequently, a
      time pattern of our world is also positive in a left-hand system.
      Therefore, subsequently we will always utilize a left-hand system
      of coordinates. The aggregation of the tests conducted then
      permitted us to refine the value of C<sub>2</sub> : <br>
      (8<b>)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C<sub>2</sub> = + 700 <u>+</u> 50 km/sec
        in a left-hand system</b>. <br>
      This value always makes probable the relationship of the time
      pattern with other universal constants based on Eq. (7) at a = 2.
      Then, the dimensionless constant of the thin Sommerfield structure
      becomes simply a ratio of the two velocities C<sub>2</sub> / C<sub>1</sub>
      , each of which occur in nature. <br>
      The tests conducted on weight [scales] with vibrations of a
      gyroscope also yield a new basic result. It appears that the
      additional force of effect and counter effect can be situated at
      different points in the system: i.e., on the support of the
      weights [scales] and on the gyroscope. We derive a pair of forces
      rotating the balance arm of the weights [scales]. Hence, <b>time
        possesses not only energy but also a rotation moment which it
        can transmit to a system</b>. <br>
      A basic checking of the results obtained with the weights [scales]
      yields a pendulum in which the body constitutes a vibrating
      gyroscope with a horizontal axis suspended on a long fine thread.
      As in the tests conducted with the weights [scales], during the
      rotation of a gyroscope under quiescent conditions nothing took
      place and this filament (thread) did not deflect from the
      perpendicular. However, at a certain stage of the vibrations in
      the gyroscope the filament deflected from the perpendicular,
      always at the same amount (with a given <i>u</i>-value) and in
      the direction from which the gyroscope’s rotation occurred in a
      counterclockwise direction. With a filament length <i>l</i> = 2 m
      and <i>u</i> = 25 m/sec, the deflection amounted to 0.07 mm,
      which yields, for the ratio of the horizontal force of the weight,
      the value 3.5 <b><sup>.</sup></b> 10<sup>-5</sup> , sufficiently
      close to the results of this suspension. <br>
      A significant disadvantage of the tests described is the
      impossibility of a simple control of the vibration conditions.
      Therefore, it is desirable to proceed to tests in which the
      vibrations are developed not by the rotor but by the stationary
      parts of the system. <br>
      In the weights, the support of the balance arm was gripped by a
      special clamp, which was connected by a flexible cable with a long
      metal plate. One end of this plate rested in a ball-bearing,
      fitted eccentrically to the shaft of an electric motor, and was
      connected by a rubber clamp with the bearing. The other end of the
      plate was fastened by a horizontal shaft. Changing the speed of
      the electric motor and the position of the cable on the plate, we
      were able to obtain harmonic oscillations of the balance arm
      support of the weights [scales] of any frequency and amplitude.
      The guiding devices for raising the balance arm support during a
      stopping of the weights eliminated the possibility of horizontal
      swaying. For the suspension of the gyroscope, it was necessary to
      find the optimal conditions under which the vibration was
      transmitted to the rotor and, at the same time, this end of the
      balance arm remained quasi-free relative to the other end, to
      which the balancing load was rigidly suspended. Under such
      conditions, the balance arm can vibrate freely, rotating around
      its end, fastened by a weight to a rigid suspension. Oscillations
      of this type could be obtained by suspending the gyroscope on a
      steel wire 0.15 mm in diameter and with a length of the order of
      1-1.5 m. With this arrangement, we observe the variation in the
      weight of the gyroscope during its rotation around the vertical
      axis. It was remarkable that, ion comparison with the previous
      tests, the effect proved to be of the opposite sign. During the
      turning of the gyroscope counterclockwise, we found, not a
      lightening, but a considerable weight increase. This means that in
      this case there operates on the gyroscope an additional force,
      oriented in a direction from which the rotation appears to be
      originating in a clockwise direction. This result signifies that
      the causality in the system and the time pattern introduced a
      vibration and that the source of the vibration establishes the
      position of the cause. In these tests, a source of vibration is
      the non-rotating part of the system, while in the initial model of
      the tests, a rotor constituted a source. Transposing in places the
      cause and the effect, we alter in respect to them the direction of
      rotation: i.e., the sense of base vector <i>j</i>. From this,
      based on Eq. (6), there originates the change in the sign of the
      additional forces. In conventional mechanics all of the forces do
      not depend entirely on what comprises the source of the vibration,
      but also on what is the effect. However, in causal mechanics,
      observing the direction of the additional forces, we can
      immediately state where the cause of the vibrations is located.
      This means that in reality it is possible to have a mechanical
      experiment distinguishing the cause from the effects. <br>
      The tests with the pendulum provided the same result. A gyroscope
      suspended on a fine wire, during the vibration of a point of this
      suspension, deflected in a direction from which its rotation
      transpired in a clockwise direction. The vibration of the
      suspension was accomplished with the aid of an electromagnetic
      device. To the iron plate of a relay installed horizontally, we
      soldered a flexible metal rod, on which the pendulum wire was
      fastened. Owing to the rod, the oscillations became more harmonic.
      The position of the relay was regulated in such a way that there
      would not be any horizontal displacements of the suspension point.
      For monitoring the control, we connected a direct current, with
      which the electromagnet attracted the plate and raised the
      suspension point. The position of the filament (thread) was
      observed with a laboratory tube having a scale with divisions of
      0.14 mm for the object under observation. Estimating by eye the
      fractions of this wide division, we could, during repeated
      measurements, obtain a result with an accuracy up to 0.01 mm. At a
      pendulum length <i>l</i> = 3.30 m and a rotation velocity <i>u</i>
      = 40 m/sec, the deflection of the gyroscope ^<i>l</i> was obtained
      as equaling 0.12 mm. in order to obtain a value of the additional
      force ^Q in relation to the weight of the rotor (Q = 250 gr), it
      is necessary to introduce a correction for the weight of the
      gyroscope mounting <i>a</i> = 1.50 gr: i.e., to multiply ^<i>l </i>/e





      by (Q + <i>a</i>)/Q. From this, we derive just that value of C<sub>2</sub>
      which is represented above (8). In these tests it turned out that
      to obtain the effect of deflection of the filament, the end of the
      gyroscope shaft, from which the rotation appears to be originating
      in a clockwise direction, must be raised somewhat. Hence, in this
      direction there should exist a certain projection of force,
      raising the gyroscope during the vibrations. In reality, the
      effect of the deflection turns out to be even less when we have
      accomplished a parametric resonance of the thread with
      oscillations, the plane of which passed through the gyroscope
      axis. Evidently, the existence of forces acting in the direction <i>ju</i>
      intensifies the similarity of <i>ju</i> with the time pattern and
      facilitates the transformation <u>+</u> C<sub>2</sub> by <u>+</u>
      (<i>i</i>C<sub>2</sub> + <i>ju </i>). It is also necessary to
      comment that the gyroscope axis needs to be located in the plane
      of the first vertical. With a perpendicular arrangementofthe axis
      -- i.e., in the plane of the meridian -- a certain additional
      displacement develops. Obviously, this displacement is created by
      force evoked by the earth’s rotation, which we mentioned in
      describing the first experiments of the vibrations on weights. Let
      us now return to an explanation of these forces. <br>
      Let us signify by <i>u</i> the linear velocity of the rotation of
      a point situated on the earth’s surface. This point is situated in
      gravitational interaction with all other points of the earth’s
      volume. Their effect is equivalent to the effect of the entire
      mass of the earth at a certain average velocity <i><u>u</u></i> ,
      the value of which is located between zero and <i>u</i> at the
      equator. Therefore, in the presence of a causal relationship there
      can originate additional forces, directed along the axis of the
      earth, andsimilar forces acting upon the gyroscope during it
      rotation with the velocity (<i>u</i> – <i><u>u</u></i> ) relative
      to the mounting. If the causal occurrences of the cosmic life of
      the earth are associated with the outer layers, these forces
      should act upon te surface in the direction from which the
      rotation appears to be originating counterclockwise: i.e., toward
      the north. Thus, in this case on the earth’s surface there should
      operate the forces of the time pattern: <br>
      (9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^Q = - <i>j </i>u – <i><u>u</u></i> / C<sub>2</sub><b><sup>.</sup></b>
      | Q | <br>
      [Translator’s Note: One line of text missing at this point ] <br>
      in the interior of the earth, forces act in the opposite
      direction, and according to the law of conservation of momentum,
      the earth’s center does not become displaced. In the polar regions
      <i>u&lt;</i> <i><u>u</u></i> , and therefore there in both
      hemispheres ^Q will be directed southward. Hence, in each
      hemisphere there is found a typical parallel where ^Q = 0. Under
      the effect of such forces, the earth will acquire the shape of a
      cardioid, extending to the south. One of the parameters
      characterizing a cardioid is the coefficient of asymmetry <i>n</i>:
      <br>
      (10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>n</i> = <i>b</i><sub>S</sub> – <i>b</i><sub>N</sub>
      /2&nbsp; <i>a</i> <br>
      where <i>a</i> equals the major semi-axis and <i>b</i><sub>S</sub>
      and <i>b</i><sub>N</sub> are the distances of the poles to the
      equatorial plane. <br>
      On Jupiter and Saturn the equatorial velocity <i>u</i> is around
      10 km/sec. Therefore, on planets with a rapid rotation the factor
      can bevery high and reach inconformity with expressions (8), (9)
      several units of the third place. Careful measurements of
      photographs of Jupiter made by the author and D.O. Mokhnach [4]
      showed that on Jupiter the southern hemisphere is more extended
      and <i>n</i> = + 3.10<sup>-3</sup><u>+</u> 0.6 <b><sup>.</sup></b>
      10<sup>-3</sup> . A similar result, only with less accuracy, was
      also obtained for Saturn: <br>
      <i>n</i> = 7.10<sup>-3</sup><u>+</u> 3.10<sup>-3</sup> . <br>
      The measurements of the force of gravity of the surface of the
      earth and the motion of artificial earth satellites indicate that
      there exists a certain difference of accelerations of gravity in
      the northern and southern hemispheres: <br>
      ^<i>g = g</i><sub>N</sub> – <i>g</i><sub>S</sub> &gt; 0, ^<i>g</i>/<i>g</i>
      ~ 3.10<sup>-5 </sup>. <br>
      For a homogenous planet this should also be the case for an
      extended southern hemisphere, because the point of this hemisphere
      are located farther from the center of gravity. The factor <i>n</i>
      should be of the order of ^g/g. It is necessary to stress that the
      conclusion is in direct contradiction with the adopted
      interpretation of the above-presented data concerning the
      acceleration of gravity. The gist of this difference consists in
      the fact that without allowance for the forces of the time
      pattern, the increase in gravity in the northern hemisphere can be
      explained only by the presence there of denser rocks. In this
      case, the leveled surface of the same value should regress
      farther. Identifying the level surface with the surface of the
      earth, it will remain to be inferred that the northern hemisphere
      is more extended. However, the sign 10q [?] obtained directly for
      Jupiter and Saturn provide evidence against this interpretation,
      containing in itself a further contradictory assumption concerning
      the disequilibrium distribution of the rocks within the earth. <br>
      The sign obtained for the asymmetry of the shapes of planets leads
      to the paradoxical conclusion to the effect that the cause of the
      physical occurrences within the celestial bodies is situated in
      the peripheral layers. However, such a result is possible if,
      e.g., the energetics of a planet are determined by its
      compression. In his studies on the internal structure of a star
      (Ref. 5), the author concluded that the power of stars is very
      similar to the power of cooling and compressing bodies. The
      inadequacy of the knowledge of the essence of the causal
      relationships prevents us from delving into this question. At the
      same time, we are compelled to insist on the conclusions which
      were obtained from a comparison of the asymmetry of the planets
      with the forces acting upon the gyroscope. <br>
      The direction of the perpendicular on the earth’s surface is
      determined by the combined effect of the forces of gravity, of
      centrifugal forces, and the forces of the time pattern ^Q
      operating toward the north in our latitudes. In the case of a free
      fall, the effect on the mounting is absent (Q = 0) and therefore
      ^Q = 0. As a result, the freely falling body should deflect from
      the perpendicular to the south by the value ^<i>l</i><sub>s</sub>:
      <br>
      (11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^<i>l</i><sub>s </sub>= ^Qn / Q <b><sup>.
        </sup></b><i>l</i> , <br>
      where <i>l</i> equals the height of the body’s fall and ^Q<sub>N</sub>
      equals the horizontal component of the forces of the time pattern
      in the moderate latitudes. A century or two ago this problem of
      the deflection of falling bodies toward the south attracted
      considerable attention. Already the first experiments conducted by
      Hook in January of 1680 at the behest of Newton for the
      verification of the deflection of falling bodies eastward led Hook
      to the conviction that a falling body deflects not only eastward
      but also southward. These experiments were repeated many time and
      often led to the same result. The best determinations were made by
      engineer Reich in the mine shafts of Freiburg (Ref. 6). At <i>l</i>
      = 158 m, he obtained ^<i>l</i><sub>s</sub> = 4.4 mm, and toward
      the east ^<i>l</i><sub>o</sub> = 28.4 mm equals the deflection,
      which agrees well with the theory. Based on Eq. (11) from these
      determinations, it follows that <br>
      (12)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^Q<sub>N</sub> /Q = 2.8 <b><sup>.</sup></b>
      10<sup>-5</sup> at <i>l</i> = 48<sup>o</sup> <br>
      which agrees well with our approximate concepts concerning the
      asymmetry of the earth’s shape. The experiments on the deflection
      of falling bodies from a perpendicular are very complex and
      laborious. The interest in these tests disappeared completely
      after Hagen in the Vatican (Ref. 7) with the aid of an Atwood
      machine obtained a deflection eastward in excellent agreement with
      the theory, and he did not derive any deflection southward. On the
      Atwood machine, owing to the tension of the filament, the eastward
      deflection decreases by only one half. However, the southward
      deflection during the acceleration equals 1/25 (as was the case
      for Hagen), according to Eqs. (9) and (11), should decrease by 25
      times. Therefore, the Hagen experiments do not refute to any
      extent the effect of the southward deflection. <br>
      Let us now return to the occurrences developing during the
      vibration of a heavy body on the surface of the earth. The
      causal-resultant relationship within the earth creates on the4
      surface, in addition to the standard time pattern <u>+</u> iC<sub>2
      </sub>, the time pattern <u>+</u> iC<sub>2</sub> - j (u - <u>u</u>)/.





      Therefore, on the surface of the earth, on a body with which a
      cause is connected, there should act the additional force ^Q,
      directed northward along the axis of the earth and being
      determined by Eq. (9). In the actual place where the effect is
      located, there should operate a force of opposite sign: i.e.,
      southward. This means that during vibrations a heavy body should
      become lighter. In the opposite case, where the source of
      vibration is connected with the mounting, the body should become
      heavier. In a pendulum, during a vibration of the suspension
      point, there should occur a deflection toward the south. These
      phenomena have opened up the remarkable possibility not only of
      measuring the distribution of the forces of the time pattern of
      the surface of the earth but also of studying the causal
      relationships and the properties of time by the simplest mode, for
      the conventional bodies, without difficult experiments with
      gyroscopes. <br>
      The tests on the study of additional forces caused by the earth’s
      rotation have the further advantage that the vibration of the
      point of the mounting cannot reach the body itself. The damping of
      the vibrations is necessary in order to express better the
      difference in the positions of cause and effect. Therefore, it is
      sufficient to suspend a body on weights on a short rubber band,
      assuring an undisturbed mode of operation of the weights during
      the vibrations. In a pendulum, one should use a fine capron
      thread. In the remaining objects the tests were conducted in the
      same way as with the gyroscopes. <br>
      In the weights, during vibrations of the mounting of the balance
      arm, an increase actually occurs in the weights of a load
      suspended on an elastic (Fig. 1). By many experiments it was
      proved that the increase in the weight -- i.e., the vertical
      component of the additional force ^Q<sub>z</sub> -- is
      proportional to the weight of the body Q. For Pulkovo, ^Q<sub>z</sub>/Q
=






      2.8 <b><sup>.</sup></b> 10<sup>-5</sup>. The horizontal
      components ^Q<sub>s</sub> were determined from the deflection of
      pendulums of various length (from 2 to 11 meters) during the
      vibration of a suspension point. During such vibrations the
      pendulums, in conformity with the increased load of the weights,
      deflected southward. For example, at <i>l</i> = 3.2 m, we
      obtained ^<i>l</i> = 0.052 mm. From this, ^Q<sub>s</sub>/Q = ^<i>l
      </i>/ <i>l</i> = 1.6 <b><sup>.</sup></b> 10-5, which corresponds
      fully to the Reich value (Ref. 11) found for the lower latitude.
      If the force Q is directed along the earth’s axis, there should be
      fulfilled the condition: ^Q<sub>z</sub>/Q<sub>s</sub> = tan <i>L</i>,
      where <i>L</i> equals the latitude of the site of the
      observations. From the data presented, it follows that tan <i>L</i>
      = 1.75, in complete conformity with the latitude at Pulkovo. <br>
      Similar tests were made for a higher latitude in the city of
      Kirovsk, and here also a good agreement with the latitude was
      obtained. For the weights and the pendulums, the amplitudes of the
      vibrations of the mounting point were of the order of tenths of a
      millimeter, while the frequency changed within the limits of tens
      of cycles per second. <br>
      The measurements conducted at various latitudes of the Northern
      Hemisphere demonstrated that, in reality, <b>there exists a
        parallel where the forces of time are lacking</b>: ^Q = 0 <b>at
        <i>L</i> = 73<sup>o</sup>05’</b>. Extrapolating the data from
      these measurements, we can obtain for the pole the estimation ^Q/Q
      = 6.5 <b><sup>.</sup></b> 10<sup>-5</sup>. Having taken the value
      C2 found from the tests conducted with a gyroscope (8), let us
      find from this for the pole: <u>u</u> <u>~</u> 45 m/sec. At the
      equator the velocity of the earth’s rotation is 10 times higher.
      Therefore, the indicated <u>u</u>-value can prove to be less than
      that expected. However, it is necessary to have it in mind that
      presently we do not have the knowledge of the rules of combining
      the time pattern which are necessary for the strict calculation
      for the <u>u</u>. taking into account the vast distance in the
      kinematics of the rotations of a laboratory gyroscope and of the
      earth, we can consider the results obtained for both cases as
      being in very good agreement. <br>
      On the weights [scales], we conducted a verification of the
      predicted variation in the sign, when the load itself becomes a
      source of vibration. For this, under the mounting area of the
      balance arm we introduce a rubber lining, and in place of the load
      on the elastic, we rigidly suspend an electric motor with a
      flywheel which raises and lowers a certain load. In the case of
      such vibrations, the entire linkage of the balance arm of the
      weights remained as before. At the same time, we did not obtain an
      increase in the weight, but a lightening of the system suspended
      to the fluctuating end of the balance arm. This result excludes
      completely the possibility of the classic explanation of the
      observed effects and markedly indicates the role of causality. <br>
      In the experiments with vibrations on weights [scales] the
      variation in the weight of a body ^Q<sub>z</sub> occurs in jumps,
      starting from a certain vibration energy. With a further increase
      in the frequency of the vibrations, the variation in the weight
      remains initially unchanged, then increases by a jump in the same
      value. In this manner, it turned out that in addition to the basic
      separating stage ^Q<sub>z </sub>, that good harmonic state of the
      oscillations, we can observe a series of quantized values: ½ ^Q,<sub>
      </sub>^Q, 2^Q, 3 ^Q..., corresponding to the continuous variation
      in the frequency of vibrations. From the observations, it follows
      that the energy of the vibrations of the beginning of each stage
      evidently forms such a series. In other words, to obtain multiple
      values, the frequencies of the vibrations must be square root of
      2, sq. rt. of 3, etc. The impression is gained that weights in the
      excited stage behaved like weights without vibrations: the
      addition of the same energy of vibrations leads to the appearance
      of the stage ^Q<sub>z</sub> . However, we have not yet managed to
      find a true explanation of this phenomenon. The appearance of the
      half quantum number remains quite incomprehensible. These quantum
      effects also occurred in the tests conducted with pendulums.
      Subsequently, it turned out that the quantum state of the effects
      is obtained in almost all of the tests. It should be noted that
      with the weights, we observed yet another interesting effect, for
      which there is no clear explanation. The energy of the vibrations,
      necessary for the excitation of a stage, depends upon the estimate
      of the balance arm of the weights [scales]. The energy is minimal
      when the load on the elastic is situated to the south of the
      weights’ [scales’] supports, and maximal when it is located to the
      north. The tests conducted with vibrations have the disadvantage
      that the vibrations always affect, to some extent, the accuracy of
      the measuring system. At the same time, in our tests vibrations
      were necessary in order to establish the position of the causes
      and effects. Therefore, it is extremely desirable to find another
      method of doing this. For example, we can pass a direct electric
      current through a long metal wire, to which the body of the
      pendulum is hung. The current can be introduced through a point of
      the suspension and passed through a very fine wire at the body of
      the pendulum without interfering with its oscillations. The
      Lorentz forces, the interaction of current, and the magnetic field
      of the earth operated in the first vertical and cannot cause a
      meridianal displacement of interest to us. These experiments were
      crowned with success. Thus, in a starting from 15 v and a current
      force of 0.03 amps, there appeared a jump-like deflection toward
      the south by an amount of 0.024 mm, which was maintained during a
      further increase of the voltage up to 30 v. To this deviation
      there corresponds the relative displacement ^<i>l</i>/<i>l</i> =
      0.85 <b><sup>.</sup></b> 10<sup>-5</sup>, which is almost exactly
      half of the stage observed during the vibrations. In the case of a
      plus voltage at the point of the suspension, we obtained a similar
      deflection northward. In this manner, knowing nothing of the
      nature of the electrical current, we could already conclude, from
      only a few of these tests, that the cause of the current is the
      displacement of the negative charges. <br>
      It turned out that in the pendulum, the position of the cause and
      effect can be established even more simply, by heating or cooling
      the point of the suspension. For this, the pendulum must be
      suspended on a metal wire which conducts heat well. The point of
      the suspension was heated by an electrical coil. During a heating
      of this coil until it glowed, the pendulum deflected southward by
      half of the stage, as during the tests conducted with the
      electrical current. With a cooling of the suspension point with
      dry ice, we obtained a northward deflection. A southward
      deflection can also be obtained by cooling the body of the
      pendulum, to tis end placing it, e.g., in a vessel containing dry
      ice at the bottom. In these experiments, only under quite
      favorable circumstances did we succeed in obtaining the full
      effect of the deflection. It is obvious that the vibrations have a
      certain basic advantage. It is likely that not only dissipation of
      the mechanical energy is significant during the vibrations. It is
      probable that the forces of the vibrations directed along <i>ju</i>
      cause the appearance of additional forces. <br>
      In the study of the horizontal forces the success in the heat
      experiments permitted us to proceed from long pendulums to a much
      more simple and precise device: namely, the torsion balance. We
      applied torsion balances of optimal sensitivity, for which the
      expected deflection was 5-20 degrees. We utilized a balance arm of
      apothecary weights [scales], to the upper handle of which we
      soldered a special clamp, to which was attached a fine tungsten
      wire with a diameter of 35 microns and a length of around 10 cm.
      The higher end of the wire was fastened by the same clamp to a
      stationary support. To avoid the accumulation of electrical
      charges and their electrostatic effect, the weights [scales] were
      reliably grounded through the support. From one end of the balance
      arm we suspended a metal rod along with a small glass vessel, into
      which it entered. At the other end was installed a balancing load
      of the order of 20 grams. The scale, divided into degrees,
      permitted us to determine the turning angle of the balance arm.
      The vessel into which the metal rod entered was filled with snow
      or water with ice. Thereby, there developed a flow of heat along
      the balance arm to the rod, and the weights [scales], mounted
      beforehand in the first vertical, were turned by this end toward
      the south. The horizontal force ^Q<sub>s</sub> was computed from
      the deflection angle <i>a</i> with the aid of the formula: <br>
      (13)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a = T<sup>2</sup> - T<sub>o</sub><sup>2 </sup>/
      4 pi<sup>2&nbsp;</sup> <b><sup>. </sup></b>g / 2<i>l</i> (^Q<sub>s</sub>
      / Q ) – <br>
      where T equals the period of the oscillation of the torsion
      balances; T<sub>o</sub> equals the period of oscillations of one
      balance arm, without loads; t equals the acceleration of gravity;
      and 2<i>l</i> equals the length of the balance arm: i.e., between
      the suspended weights. In this equation the angle a is expressed
      in radians. For example, in the weights with <i>l</i> = 9.0 cm, T
      = 132 seconds, and T<sub>o</sub> = 75 seconds, we observed a
      southward deflection by an angle of 17.5<sup>o</sup>. Thence,
      based on Eq. (13), it follows that ^Q<sub>s</sub> / Q = Q = 1.8 <b><sup>.</sup></b>
      10<sup>-5</sup> is in good agreement with the previously derived
      value of the horizontal forces. Half and multiple displacements
      were also observed in these experiments conducted with the torsion
      balances. Another variation of the experiment was the heating, by
      a small alcohol lamp, of a rod suspended together with a vessel
      containing ice. The same kind of alcohol lamp was placed at the
      other end of the balance arm with a compensating weight, but in
      such a way that it could not heat the balance arm. During the
      burning of both alcohol lamps the weights did not of out of
      equilibrium. In these experiments we invariably obtained the
      opposite effect: i.e., a turning to the north of the end of the
      balance arm with the rod. <br>
      It is necessary to mention one important conclusion which follows
      from the combination of the occurrences which have been observed.
      In the case of the effect on the mounting, this might not
      influence a heavy body; and at the same time, forces, applied to
      each point of it, developed in the body: i.e., mass forces and,
      hence, identical to the variation in the weight. This signifies,
      by influencing the mounting, where the forces of the attraction
      are located, comprising a result of the weight, we can obtain a
      variation in the weight, i.e., a change in the cause. Therefore,
      the tests conducted indicate a distinct possibility of reversing
      the causal relationships. <br>
      The second cycle of tests on studying the qualities of time was
      started as a result of the observations of quite strange
      circumstances, interrupting a repetition of the experiments. As
      early as the initial experiments with the gyroscopes it was
      necessary to face the fact that sometimes the tests could be
      managed quite easily, and sometimes they proved to be fruitless,
      even with a strict observance of the same conditions. These
      difficulties were also noted in the old experiments on the
      southward deflection of falling bodies. Only in those tests in
      which, within wide limits, it is possible to intensify the causal
      effect -- as, e.g., during the vibrations of the mounting of the
      weights [scales] or of the pendulum -- can we almost always attain
      a result. Evidently, in addition to the constant pattern C<sub>2</sub>,
      in the case of time, <b>there also exists a variable property
        which can be called the density or intensity of time</b>. In a
      case of low density it is difficult for time to influence the
      material systems, and there is required an intensive emphasis of
      the causal-resultant relationship in order that force caused by
      the time pattern would appear. It is possible that our
      psychological sensation of empty or substantive time has not only
      a subjective nature but also, similarly to the sensation of the
      flow of time, an objective physical basis. <br>
      Evidently many circumstances exist affecting the density of time
      in the space surrounding us. <b>In late autumn and in the first
        half of winter all of the tests can be easily managed. However,
        in summer these experiments become difficult to such an extent
        that many of them could not be completed. </b>Probably, in
      conformity with these conditions, the tests in the high altitudes
      can be performed much more easily than in the south; in addition
      to these regular variations, there often occur some changes in the
      conditions required for the success of the experiments: these
      transpired in the course of one day or even several hours.
      Obviously, the density of time changes within broad limits, owing
      to the processes occurring in nature, and our tests utilize a
      unique instrument to record these changes. If this be so<b>, it
        proves possible to have one material influence another through
        time</b>. Such a relationship could be foreseen, since the
      causal-resultant phenomena occurred not only in time but also with
      the aid of time. Therefore, in each process of nature time can be
      extended or formed. These conclusions could be confirmed by a
      direct experiment. <br>
      Since we are studying the phenomenon of such a generality as time,
      it is evident that it is sufficient to take the simplest
      mechanical process in order to attempt to change the density of
      time. For example, using any motor, we can raise and lower a
      weight or change the tension of a tight elastic band. We obtain a
      system with two poles, a source of energy and its outflow: i.e.,
      the causal-resultant dipole. With the aid of a rigid transmission,
      the pole of this dipole can be separated for a fairly extensive
      distance. We will bring one of these poles close to a long
      pendulum during the vibrations of its point of suspension. It is
      necessary to tune the vibrations in such a way that the full
      effect of southward deflection would not develop, but only the
      tendency for the appearance of this effect. It turned out that
      this tendency increases appreciably and converts even to the
      complete effect if we bring near to the body of the pendulum or to
      the suspension point that pole of the dipole where the absorption
      of the energy is taking place. However, with the approach of the
      other pole (of the motor), the appearance of the effect of
      southern deflection in the pendulum invariably became difficult.
      In the case of a close juxtaposition of the poles of the dipole,
      their influence on the pendulum practically disappeared. It is
      evident that in this case a considerable compensation of their
      effects occurs. It turned out that <b>the effect of the causal
        pole</b> does not depend on the direction along which it is
      installed relative to the pendulum. Its effect <b>depends only on
        the distance (spacing)</b>. Repeated and careful measurements
      demonstrated that <b>this effect diminishes</b>, not inversely
      proportional to the square of the distance, as in the case of
      force fields, but <b>inversely proportional to the first power of
        the distance</b>. In raising and lowering of a 10-kg weight
      suspended through a unit distance, its influence was sensed at a
      distance of 2-3 meters from the pendulum. <b>Even the thick wall
        of the laboratory did not shield this effect</b>. It is
      necessary to comment that all of these tests, similarly to the
      previous ones, also were not always successful. <br>
      The results obtained indicate that nearer the system with the
      causal-resultant relationship the density of time actually
      changes. <b>Near the motor there occurs a thinning (rarefaction
        of time), while near the energy receiver its compaction takes
        place. The impression is gained that time is extended by a cause
        and, contrariwise, it becomes more advanced in that place where
        the effect is located</b>. Therefore, in the pendulum assistance
      is obtained from the receiver, and interference from the part on
      the motor. By these conditions we might also explain the easy
      accomplishment of these experiments in winter and in northern
      latitudes, while in summer and in the south it is difficult to
      perform the tests. The fact of the matter is that in our latitude
      in winter are located the effects of the dynamics of the
      atmosphere of the southern latitudes. This circumstance can assist
      the appearance of the effects of the time pattern. However,
      generally and particularly <b>in summer the heating by solar rays
        creates an atmosphere loader, interfering with the effects</b>.
      <br>
      The effect of time differs basically from the effect of force
      fields. The effect of the causal pole on the device (pendulum)
      immediately creates two equal and opposite forces, applied to the
      body of the pendulum and the suspension point. There occurs a
      transmission of energy, without momentum, and, hence, also without
      delivery to the pole. This circumstance explains the reduction of
      the influences inversely proportional to the first power of the
      distances, since according to this law an energy decrease takes
      place. Moreover, this law could be foreseen, simply by proceeding
      from circumstance of time to expressed by the turning, and hence
      with it it is necessary to link the plane, passing through the
      pole with any orientation in space. In the case of the force lines
      emerging from the pole, their density decreases in inverse
      proportion to the square of the distance; however, the density of
      the planes will diminish according to the law of the first power
      of the distance. The transmission of energy without momentum
      (pulse) should still have the following very important property:
      Such a transmission should be instantaneous: i.e., it cannot be
      propagating because the transmission of the pulse is associated
      with propagation. This circumstance follows from the most general
      concepts concerning time. Time in the universe is not propagated
      but appears immediately everywhere. On a time axis the entire
      universe is projected by one point. Therefore, the altered
      properties of a given second will appear everywhere at once,
      diminishing according to the law of inverse proportionality of the
      first power of the distance. It seems to us that such a
      possibility of the instantaneous transfer of information through
      time should not contradict the special theory of relativity -- in
      particular, the relativity of the concept of simultaneity. The
      fact is that the simultaneity of effects through time is realized
      in that advantageous system of coordinates with which the source
      of these effects is associated. <br>
      The possibility of communications through time will probably help
      to explain not only the features of biological relationship but
      also a number of puzzling phenomena of the psychics of man.
      Perhaps instinctive knowledge is obtained specifically in this
      manner. It is quite likely that in this same way are realized also
      the phenomena of telepathy: i.e., the transmission of thought over
      a distance. All these relationships are not shielded and hence
      have the property for the transmission of influences through time.
      <br>
      Further observations indicate that in the causal-resultant dipoles
      a complete compensation of the effect of its poles does not take
      place. Obviously, in the process there occurs the absorption or
      output of certain qualities of time. Therefore, the effect of the
      process could be observed without a preliminary excitation of the
      system. <br>
      The previously applied torsion weights (balances) were modified in
      such a manner that, when possible, we would increase the distance
      between the weights suspended on the balance arm. This requirement
      was realized with a considerable lengthening (up to 1.5 m) of the
      suspension filament of one of the weights. As a result, the
      torsion balances came to resemble a gravitational variometer, only
      with the difference that in them the balance arm could be freely
      moved around a horizontal axis. The entire system was well
      grounded and shielded by a metal housing in order to avert the
      electrostatic effects. The masses of the weights were of the order
      of 5-20 grams. In the realization of any reversible process near
      one of the weights, we obtained a turning of the balance arm
      toward the meridian by a small angle a of the order of 0<sup>o</sup>.3,





      with a sensitivity of the weights [scales] corresponding to a
      slewing by 9<sup>o</sup> for the case of the effects of the forces
      of a time pattern of full magnitude. In this manner, the forces
      which were occurring proved to be quite similar to those
      previously investigated. They act along the axis o the earth and
      yield the same series of quantized values of the slewing angle: ½
      a, a,2a ...&nbsp; It turned out that the vertical components of
      these forces can be observed in the analytical scales, if we
      separate the weights in them far enough, by means of the same
      considerable lengthening of the suspension filament of one of the
      weights. <br>
      These tests indicated the basic possibility of the effect through
      time of an irreversible process upon a material system. At the
      same time, the very low value of the forces obtained testifies to
      a certain constructive incorrectness of the experiment, owing to
      which there takes place an almost complete compensation of the
      forces originating in the system. As a result, only a small
      residue of these forces acts on the system. Obviously, in our
      design, during the effect upon one weight, there also develops an
      effect upon the second weight, stopping the turning of the torsion
      balances. Most likely, this transmission of the effect to the
      second weight occurs through the suspension point. In reality, the
      appearance of forces of the time pattern in one of the weights
      signifies the transformation of the forces of the weight of this
      load and its reaction in the mounting point to a new time pattern,
      associated with the earth’s rotation. The transformation of the
      time pattern in the suspension point of the torsion balances can
      also cause the transformation of all of the forces acting here,
      signifying also the reaction of the second weight. However, the
      appearance of an additional reaction requires the appearance of
      the additional force of the weight of the second load. Therefore,
      in this design, during the effect upon one load there also
      originates an effect upon the second load, stopping the turning of
      the torsion balances. The concept discussed indicates that to
      obtain substantial effect in the torsion balances, it is necessary
      to introduce an abrupt asymmetry in the suspension of the loads. <br>
      As a result of a number of tests, the following design of the
      asymmetrical torsion balances proved successful: one cylindrical
      load of considerable weight was chosen, around 300 grams. This
      main weight was suspended from the permanent filament made of
      capron, with a length of around 1.5 meters and a diameter of 0.15
      mm. to this weight there was rigidly fastened, arranged
      horizontally, a light-weight metal plate around 10 cm in length.
      The free end of this plate was supported by a very thin capron
      filament fastened at the same point as the main filament. From
      this free end of the plate, we suspended on a long thin wire a
      weight of the order of 10 grams. For damping the system the main
      weight was partly lowered into a vessel containing machine oil. By
      a turn at the suspension point, the horizontal plate was set
      perpendicular to the plane of the meridian. <br>
      Let us now assume that in the system a force has developed
      affecting only the main weight in the plane of the meridian: i.e.,
      perpendicularly to the plate. This force deflects the main weight
      by a certain angle x. The free end of the plate with a small load
      will also be deflected by this same angle. Therefore, upon the
      small load there will act a horizontal force, tending to turn the
      plate toward the plane of the meridian and equalizing the weight
      of the small load multiplied by the angle x. Since the deflection
      angle x equals the relative change in the weight, a force equaling
      the additional force of the time pattern for the weight of a small
      load will act on the small load. Therefore, the turning angle of
      the torsion balances can be computed according to the previous Eq.
      (13), assuming that in it T<sub>o</sub> = 0. The same turning, but
      in an opposite direction, should be obtained during the effect
      upon only one small load. This condition was confirmed by
      experiments with strong influences from close distances. However,
      it turned out that a heavy weight absorbed the effect better than
      a small weight. Therefore, weak remote forces are received
      (absorbed) by only one large load, which permitted us to observe
      the effects upon the device at very considerable distances from
      it, of the order of 10-20 meters. However, the optimal distance in
      these tests was around 5 meters. <br>
      The asymmetrical torsion balances described proved to be as
      successful design. The calculated angle of their turning under the
      effect o additional forces of the time pattern should be of the
      order of 14<sup>o</sup>. In the case of a contactless effect over
      a distance, we obtained large deflections, which reached the
      indicated values. In these tests, as in the previous ones, we once
      again observe the discrete state of the stable deflections with a
      power of one fourth o the full effect: i.e., 3<sup>o</sup>5’. <br>
      The processes causing deflection of the weights were most varied:
      heating of the body; burning of an electric tube; cooling of a
      previously heated body; the operation of an electrical battery,
      closed through resistance; the dissolving of various salts in
      water; and even the movement of a man’s head. A particularly
      strong effect is exerted by nonstationary process: e.g., the
      blinking of an electric bulb. Owing to the processes occurring
      near the weights and in nature, the weights behave themselves very
      erratically. Their zero point often becomes displaced, shifting by
      the above-indicated amounts and interfering considerably with the
      observations. It turned out that <b>the balances can be shielded,
        to a considerable extent, from these influences by placing near
        them an organic substance consisting only of right-handed
        molecules: for example, sugar. The left-handed molecules --
        e.g., turpentine -- evidently cause the opposite effect.</b> <br>
      In essence, the tests conducted demonstrate that it is possible to
      have the influence through time of one process upon another. In
      reality, the appearance of forces turning the torsion balances
      alters the potential energy of the balances. Therefore, in
      principle, there should take place a change in the physical
      process which is associated with them. <br>
      At a session of the International Astronomical Union in Brussels
      in the fall of 1966 the author presented a report concerning the
      physical features of the components of double stars. In binary
      systems a satellite constitutes an unusual star. As a result of
      long existence, a satellite becomes similar to a principal star in
      a number of physical aspects (brightness, spectral type, radius).
      At such great distances the possibility is exclude that the
      principal star will exert an influence upon a satellite in the
      usual manner: i.e., through force fields. Rather, the binary stars
      constitute an astronomical example of the effect of the processes
      in one body upon the processes in another, through time. <br>
      Among the many tests conducted, we should mention the observations
      which demonstrated the existence of yet another interesting
      feature in the qualities of time. It turned out that in the
      experiments with the vibrations of the mounting point of the
      balances or of the pendulum additional forces of the time pattern
      which developed do not disappear immediately with the stoppage of
      the vibrations, but will remain in the system for a considerable
      period. Considering that they decrease according to the
      exponential law e<sup>-t</sup>/t<sub>o</sub>, estimations were
      made of the time to of their relaxation. It turned out that t<sub>o</sub>
      does not depend on the mass of the body but upon its density <i>p</i>.
      We obtained the following approximate data: for lead, <i>S</i> =
      11, t<sub>o </sub>= 14 second; for aluminum, <i>S</i> = 2.7, t<sub>o</sub>
      = 28 seconds; for wood <i>S</i> = 0.5, t<sub>o</sub> = 70
      seconds. In this manner it is possible that t<sub>o </sub>is
      inversely proportional to the square root of the body’s density.
      It is curious that the preservation of the additional forces in
      the system, after the cessation of the vibrations, can be observed
      in the balances in the most simple manner. Let us imagine balance
      scales in which one of the weights is suspended on rubber. Let us
      take this weight with one hand and, with the pressure of the other
      hand upon the balance arm, replace the effect of the weight taken
      from it. We will shake the removed weight with one hand and, with
      the pressure of the other hand upon the balance arm, replace the
      effect of the weight taken from it. We will shake the removed
      weight for a certain time (around a minute) on the rubber, and
      then we will place it back upon the scales. The scales will
      indicate te gradual lightening of this load, in conformity with
      the above-listed values for t<sub>o</sub> . It is understandable
      that in this test it is necessary to take measures in order that
      one’s hand does not heat the balance arm of the scales. In place
      of a hand, the end of the balance arm from which the weight is
      taken can be held by a mechanical clamp. Sometimes this amazingly
      simple test can be accomplished quite easily, but there are days
      when, similarly to certain other tests, it is achieved with
      difficulty or cannot be accomplished at all. <br>
      Based on the above-presented theoretical concepts and all of the
      experimental data, the following general inferences can be made: <br>
      1) The causal states, derived from three basic axioms, of the
      effect concerning the properties of a time pattern are confirmed
      by the tests. Therefore, we can consider that these axioms are
      substantiated by experiment. Specifically, we confirm axiom II
      concerning the spatial non-overlapping of causes and effects.
      Therefore, the force fields transmitting the influences should be
      regarded as a system of discrete, non-overlapping points. This
      finding is linked with the general philosophical principle of the
      possibility of cognition of the world. For the possibility of at
      least a marginal cognition, the combination of all material
      objects should be a calculated set: i.e, it should represent a
      discrete state, being superimposed on the continuum of space. <br>
      As concerns the actual results obtained during the experimental
      justification of the axiom of causality, among them the most
      important are the conclusions concerning the finiteness of the
      time pattern, the possibility of partial reversal of the causal
      relationships, and the possibility of obtaining work owing to the
      time pattern. <br>
      2) The tests proved the existence of the effects through time of
      one material system upon another. This effect does not transmit a
      pulse (momentum), meaning it does not propagate but appears
      simultaneously in any material system. In this manner, in
      principle it proves possible to have a momentary relationship and
      a momentary transmission of information. Time accomplishes a
      relationship between all phenomena of nature and participates
      actively in them. <br>
      3) Time has diverse qualities, which can be studied by
      experiments. Time contains the entire universe of still unexplored
      occurrences. The physical experiments studying these phenomena
      should gradually lead to an understanding of what time represents.
      However, knowledge should show us how to penetrate into the world
      of time and teach us how to affect it. <br>
