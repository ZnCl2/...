      <p><b>Scientific Name: </b>Olive Leaf <br>
        <b>Other Names: </b>Oleae europaea, Oleae folium, Olivier </p>
      <p><b>Uses</b> </p>
      <p>One of the most active chemicals found in the leaves of olive
        trees is known as oleuropein. In animal studies, oleuropein not
        only prevented the development of high blood pressure but also
        reduced existing high blood pressure. Although the possible
        reasons for these effects are not known, it is thought that
        oleuropein may relax blood vessels, and it may also prevent
        deposits of plaque that lead to arteriosclerosis or "hardening
        of the arteries". A few small human studies of olive leaf for
        controlling high blood pressure have been inconclusive and more
        studies are needed to confirm or deny these effects. </p>
      <p>In other studies, olive leaf extract appeared to lower blood
        sugar levels in laboratory animals with diabetes. It is believed
        that olive leaf has a dual effect -- it may cause more glucose
        to be utilized by the body and it may also stimulate the release
        of insulin. Few results are available from human studies,
        however. More research into the possible blood sugar-lowering
        effects of olive leaf is needed before it can be recommended for
        this use. </p>
      <p>In recently reported laboratory studies, extracts of olive leaf
        have shown anti-infective properties. Extracts are concentrated
        liquid preparations usually made by soaking chopped or mashed
        plant parts in a liquid such as alcohol, and then straining out
        the solid parts. In separate studies, contact with olive leaf
        extract killed specific types of bacteria and slowed the growth
        of some skin fungi. Another laboratory study found that an
        extract of olive leaf interfered with some of the infective
        properties of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Much more study
        in animals and humans is needed to confirm or disprove the
        potential anti-infective effects of olive leaf extract. </p>
      <p><b>Precautions</b> </p>
      <p>Very little information is available on how olive leaf might
        affect a developing fetus or an infant. Therefore, its use is
        not recommended during pregnancy or breast-feeding. </p>
      <p>Individuals with diabetes should avoid using large amounts of
        olive leaf because it can lower blood sugar levels, potentially
        resulting in hypoglycemia (blood sugar that is too low).
        Symptoms of low blood sugar include shakiness, sweating,
        confusion, distorted speech, and loss of muscle control. If not
        corrected, low blood sugar can lead to unconsciousness and even
        death. </p>
      <p><b>What side effects should I watch for?</b> </p>
      <p>Olive leaf may lower blood pressure by several methods, which
        may include the widening of blood vessels. Hypotension or blood
        pressure that is too low may result. Hypotension may not have
        any definite symptoms, but it may produce blurred vision,
        confusion, dizziness, or fainting. </p>
      <p><b>What interactions should I watch for?</b> </p>
      <p>Due to its possible ability to lower blood pressure, olive leaf
        is believed to increase the effects of drugs that also lower
        blood pressure. Some blood pressure-lowering drugs are: </p>
      <blockquote>ACE inhibitors such as captopril, enalapril,
        lisinopril, and Monopril <br>
        Beta blockers such as atenolol, metoprolol, and propranolol <br>
        Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine, Norvasc, and
        verapamil <br>
        Diuretics such as Dyazide, furosemide, and hydrochlorothiazide</blockquote>
      Due to a possible decrease in blood sugar levels, taking olive
      leaf may increase the effects of insulin and oral drugs for
      diabetes, such as:
      <blockquote>Actos <br>
        Amaryl <br>
        Avandia <br>
        glipizide (Glucotrol XL) <br>
        glyburide (Glynase) <br>
        Glyset <br>
        metformin (Glucophage) <br>
        Prandin <br>
        Precose</blockquote>
      Because olive leaf may decrease blood sugar levels, taking it with
      other blood sugar-lowering herbal products may result in
      hypoglycemia -- blood sugar that is too low. Herbals that may
      reduce blood sugar include:
      <blockquote>Eleuthero <br>
        Fenugreek <br>
        Ginger (in high amounts) <br>
        Kudzu <br>
        Panax ginseng</blockquote>
      Some interactions between herbal products and medications can be
      more severe than others. The best way for you to avoid harmful
      interactions is to tell your doctor and/or pharmacist what
      medications you are currently taking, including any
      over-the-counter products, vitamins, and herbals. For specific
      information on how olive leaf interacts with drugs, other herbals,
      and foods and the severity of those interactions, please use our <a

      <p><b>Should I take it?</b> </p>
      <p>Trees that produce olives are thought to have originated in the
        areas around the Mediterranean Sea. Now growing wild and
        cultivated in orchards throughout Mediterranean countries, they
        are also found in warm parts of Africa, Asia, Australia, and the
        Americas. Generally, cultivated olive trees are kept relatively
        small so that the ripe fruits can be harvested easily. They have
        clusters of white or yellow flowers and small narrow leaves that
        stay green all year. Traditionally the symbol of peace, olive
        branches were woven into garlands and worn by ancient Greek and
        Roman leaders. They were also awarded to athletes at the
        original Olympic games. Today, they are represented on Olympic
        medals and on many flags including the flag of the United
        Nations. </p>
      <p>For medicinal use, olive leaves may be gathered at any time of
        the year. Typically, they are dried and used to make a tea or
        processed into extracts. At various times since the residents of
        a Mediterranean island named Crete are known to have been using
        olive leaf as medicine about 5,000 years ago, it has been used
        to treat a number of chronic and infective illnesses. </p>
      <p><b>Dosage and Administration</b> </p>
      <p>Olive leaf is most often sold as capsules or liquid extracts.
        Extracts are concentrated liquid preparations usually made by
        soaking chopped or mashed plant parts in a liquid such as
        alcohol, and then straining out the solid parts. A typical dose
        is 400 mg four times a day, but dosing recommendations vary
        considerably. If you use an olive leaf product, follow the
        directions on the package that you buy. </p>
      <p>Olive leaf tea may be made by soaking about 2 teaspoons of
        dried olive leaf in 5 or 6 ounces of boiling water for 30
        minutes. After the solid parts are strained out, olive leaf tea
        may be taken up to four times a day. </p>
      <p><b>Summary</b> </p>
      <p>The major current uses of olive leaf are to lower high blood
        pressure and high blood sugar, although neither of these effects
        has been proven through well-controlled studies. </p>
      <p><b>Risks</b> </p>
      <p>Pregnant and breast-feeding women are advised to avoid taking
        olive leaf because not enough is known about its possible
        effects. </p>
      <p><b>Side Effects</b> </p>
      <p>Taking olive leaf may result in hypoglycemia or hypotension. </p>
      <p><b>Interactions</b> </p>
      <p>Olive leaf may enhance the effects of drugs that lower blood
        pressure. It may also increase blood-sugar lowering effects of
        drugs or herbals. </p>

      <p><b>INTRODUCTION</b> </p>
      <p>Science has long stalked the chemical world within plants to
        uncover their amazing healing secrets. Lately, these
        investigations have yielded discovery after discovery of natural
        compounds with promising health and medical potential. </p>
      <p>Some of these compounds stimulate the production of anti-cancer
        enzymes in the body. Others bind and neutralize certain
        carcinogenic chemicals. Other have antioxidant
        effects,protecting the body from oxidation damage caused by
        harmful molecular fragments known as free radicals that
        contribute to aging and illness. </p>
      <p>These natural compunds are found abundantly in roots, stems,
        leaves, fruits and vegetables. They go by a variety of
        scientific names like polyphenols, flavonoids, flavonols,
        pycnogenols, glucosinolates, isoprenoids, carotenoids,
        tocotrienols and proanthocyanadins. To keep things simple and
        pronounceable, we will just call them phytochemicals or
        phytonutrients. Phyto stems from the Greek word for plant. </p>
      <p>The volume of current research is intense. Some experts say
        these compounds may offer the best protection we know of against
        the diseases that plague us today. There's much yet to learn
        about the tissue-specific way they work. But with time, these
        phytonutrients, in the form of supplements or medical
        preparations, may play a major role in anti-aging medicine and
        how we prevent and treat disease. </p>
      <p>Among the many phytochemicals that have interested me, as a
        clinician, is oleuropein (pronounced oh-lee-or-oh-pin), a
        substance found in the olive leaf. I, as well as other health
        practitioners, have found that a natural supplement of olive
        leaf extract contains substantial medicinal benefits. Among
        them, boosting the energy among patients and aiding in the
        treatment of herpes and other viral conditions, flu and colds,
        fungal infections, chronic fatigue and allergies. I have also
        been surprised by unexpected results generated by this
        supplement. </p>
      <p><b>The Olive Leaf in History and Medicine</b> </p>
      <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is something very
        special about the olive leaf. For one thing, it is the first
        botanical mentioned in the Bible. </p>
      <p>"And the dove came in to him in the evening, and lo, in her
        mouth was an olive leafplucked off. So Noah knew that the waters
        were abated from off the earth." (Genesis 8 : 11) </p>
      <p>After the Great Flood we didn't hear too much about the olive
        leaf for a long time. Obviously this was a hard act to follow. </p>
      <p>In a much later biblical time (Ezekiel 47 : 12), God speaks of
        a tree: "The fruit thereof shall be for meat, and the leaf
        thereof for medicine." </p>
      <p>Was it the olive tree? </p>
      <p>In Revelations, at the very end of the New Testament, there is
        an angelic vision of a "tree of life" whose leaves "were for the
        healing of the nations." Today, as modern medicine increasingly
        embraces phytochemicals it is interesting to speculate about the
        biblical "tree of life." </p>
      <p>Again, was it perhaps the olive tree? </p>
      <p>The ancient Egyptians may be been the first to put the olive
        leaf to practical use. They regarded it as a symbol of heavenly
        power, and in keeping with that belief, they extracted its oil
        and used it to mummify their kings. </p>
      <p>Later cultures found the leaf was better utilized for the
        living than the dead. Over the ages, there is documentation that
        it was a popular folk remedy for combating fevers. </p>
      <p>The first formal medical mention of the olive leaf - an account
        describing its ability to cure severe cases of fever and malaria
        -- ocurred about 150 years ago. In 1854, the Pharmaceutical
        Journal carried a report by one Daniel Hanbury and contained the
        following simple healing recipe: </p>
      <p><b>Boil a handful of leaves in a quart of water down to half
          its original volume. Then administer the liquid in the amount
          of a wineglass every 3 or 4 hours until the fever is cured.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The author said he discovered the effective tincture in 1843
        and had used it successfully. This method became well known in
        England for treating sick Britons returning from His or Her
        Majesty's tropical colonies. The author believed that a bitter
        substance in the leaves was the key healing ingredient. </p>
      <p>He was right. </p>
      <p>Decades later, scientists isolated a bitter substance from the
        leaf and named it oleuropein. It was found to be one ingredient
        in a compound produced by the olive tree that makes it
        particularly robust and resistant against insect and bacterial
        damage. From a technical angle, oleuropein is an iridoid, a
        structural class of chemical compounds found in plants. It is
        present in olive oil, throughout the olive tree, and is, in
        fact, the bitter material that is eliminated from the olives
        when they are cured. </p>
      <p>In 1962, an Italian researcher reported that oleuropein lowered
        blood pressure in animals. This triggered a flurry of scientific
        interest in the olive leaf. </p>
      <p>Other European researchers confirmed this interesting finding.
        In addition, they found it could also increase blood flow in the
        coronary arteries, relieve arrhythmias, and prevent intestinal
        muscle spasms. </p>
      <p>Around this time, a Dutch researcher determined the active
        ingredient in oleuropein to be a substance he called elenolic
        acid. It was found to have a powerful anti-bacterial effect. </p>
      <p>By the late 1960's, research by scientists at Upjohn, a major
        American pharmaceutical company, showed that elenolic acid also
        inhibited the growth of viruses. In fact, it stopped every virus
        that it was tested against. Among others, the substance was
        found to counteract a variety of viruses associated with the
        common cold of humans. </p>
      <p>Moreover, a number of laboratory experiments at this time with
        calcium elenolate, a salt of elenolic acid, demonstrated a
        strong effect against not just viruses, but bacteria and
        parasitic protozoans as well. </p>
      <p>The compound worked effectively at low concentrations without
        any harmful influence on host cell mechanisms, the American
        researchers concluded. That meant they believed it to be
        extremely safe and non-toxic, even at high doses. </p>
      <p>Following test tube experiments, the pharmaceutical company
        launched animal tests. Experiments showed the compound was
        indeed extremely well tolerated. There was a hitch, however. In
        the body of an animal, the substance rapidly attached to protein
        in blood serum. For all intents and purposes, this meant calcium
        elenolate was of no use. The binding action essentially took it
        "out of action," rendering it ineffective. As a result of this
        obstacle, research into the compound as a potential virus and
        bacteria killing pharmaceutical drug was dropped. </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, research and interest in olive leaf extracts has
        moved forward, primarily in Europe. Among the most recent
        findings are these: </p>
      <ul>
        In a series of experiments, oleuropein was found to inactivate
        bacteria by apparently dissolving the outer lining of microbes.
        <p>At the University of Milan Pharacological Sciences,
          researchers found that oleuropein inhibited oxidation of
          low-density lipoproteins, the so-called "bad cholesterol"
          involved in heart and aterial disease. This revelation, if
          confirmed by further research, suggests that oleuropein may
          contain antioxidant properties similar to other phytochemical
          compounds. Medical researcher Morton Walker, D.P.M., writing
          about olive leaf extract in the July 1996 issue of the
          Townsend Letter for Doctors and Patients, comments that the
          intake of flavonoids "is correlated with a lower incidence of
          cardiovascular disease indicated that the daily intake of
          olive oil and/or olive leaf extract containing phenols will
          likely bring on a similar result." At the present time, the
          cardiovascular research community is excited about such
          actions. Studies have shown that some phytochemicals can
          reduce the harmful oxidation of cholesterol as well as slow
          down the accelerated clumping of blood platelets that can lead
          to dangerous clots. </p>
        <p>At Spain's University of Granada, pharmacologists determined
          that olive leaf extract causes relaxation of arterial walls in
          laboratory animals. Such results suggest a possible benefit
          for hypertension, an effect first mentioned by researchers
          more than 30 years ago. </p>
        <p>In Tunis, researchers found that aqueous extract of olive
          leaves reduced hypertension, blood sugar, and the level of
          uric acid in rodents. This finding again indicates potential
          in the treatment of hypertension, as well as diabetes and
          heart disease. An elevated uric acid level is a risk factor
          for heart disease.</p>
      </ul>
      Remember the biochemical snag mentioned earlier -- that elenolic
      acid binds with proteins in the body to nullify any therapeutic
      use? The problem has been overcome and the door opened for the
      development of effective olive leaf extract supplements.
      <p>Such products are now available, containing oleuropein and
        synergistic olive leaf extracts, including flavonoids. </p>
      <p>The medicinal firepower is there. </p>
      <p>The safety is there. </p>
      <p>The added benefit of other phytochemicals is there. In short,
        we now have an exciting new herbal with a promising future. </p>
      <p><b>Olive Leaf Firepower</b> </p>
      <p>For the record, the researchers at Upjohn found calcium
        elenolate effective in test tube experiments against the
        following viruses: <b>herpes, vaccinia, pseudorabies,
          Newcastle, Coxsacloe A 21, encepthlomyocarditis, polio 1, 2,
          and 3, vesicular stomititus, sindbis, reovirus, Moloney Murine
          leukemia, Rauscher Murine leukemia, Moloney sarcoma,</b> and
        many influenza and parainfluenza types. </p>
      <p>They found it effective against these bacteria and parasitic
        protozoans: <b>lactobacillus plantarum W50, brevis 50,
          pediococcus cerevisiae 39, leuconostoc mesenteroides 42,
          staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis,
          enterobacteraerogenes NRRL B-199, E. cloacae NRRL B-414, E.
          coli, salamonella tyhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, P.
          solanacearum, P. lachrymans, erwinia carotovora, E.
          tracheiphila, xanthomonas vesicatoria, corynesbacterium
          Michiganese, plasmodium falciparum, virax</b> and <b>malariae</b>.
      </p>
      <p>The researchers credit a number of unique properties possessed
        by the olive leaf compound for the broad killing power: </p>
      <ul>
        An ability to interfere with critical amino acid production
        essential for viruses.
        <p>An ability to contain viral infection and/or spread by
          inactivating viruses or by preventing virus shedding, budding
          or assembly at the cell membrane. </p>
        <p>The ability to directly penetrate infected cells and stop
          viral replication. </p>
        <p>In the case of retroviruses, it is able to neutralize the
          production of reverse transcriptase and protease. These
          enzymes are essential for a retrovirus, such as HIV, to alter
          the RNA of a healthy cell. </p>
        <p>It can stimulate phagocytosis, an immune system response in
          which cells ingest harmful microorganisms and foreign matter.</p>
      </ul>
      The research suggests that this may be a "true anti-viral"
      compound because it appears to selectively block an entire
      virus-specific system in the infected host. It thus appears to
      offer healing effects not addressed by pharmaceutical antibiotics.
      <p><b>Clinical Perspective</b> </p>
      <p>Clinically, the olive leaf extract has been used for a
        relatively short time. Health professionals began using it early
        in 1995 when it first became available. Although we do not have
        long-term perspectives as yet, initial results are very
        positive. We see a very promising and unique herbal with
        multiple applications. It shows considerable therapeutic action
        against many common conditions. In short, it appears to be
        living up to its unique background and expectations. </p>
      <p>From research and clinical experience to date, we can say that
        supplemental olive leaf extract may be beneficial in the
        treatment for conditions caused by, or associated with, a virus,
        retrovirus, bacterium, or protozoan. Among such conditions are
        influenza, the common cold, meningitis, Epstein-Barr Virus
        (EBV), encephalitis, herpes I and II, human herpes virus 6 and
        7, shingles, HIV/ARC/AIDS, chronic fatigue, hepatitis B,
        pneumonia, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, malaria, dengue, bacteremia,
        severe diarrhea, blood poisoning, and dental, ear, urinary tract
        and surgical infections. </p>
      <p>In our clinic, we use olive leaf extract for a variety of
        infectious and chronic conditions. We also believe that many
        people who lead stressful lives or who may be particularly
        susceptible to colds and viruses may benefit from long-term use
        of olive leaf extract as a preventive agent. </p>
      <p>As I mentioned earlier, I am constantly surprised by unexpected
        benefits reported by patients. This indicates that we are
        perhaps just scratching the surface in our understanding of
        phytochemical benefits. Patients have told me about improved
        psoriasis, normalization of arrhythmias (heart beat
        irregularities), and less pain from hemorroids, toothaches and
        chronically achy joints. </p>
      <p>I myself cured a chronic toenail fungal infection after
        starting on the supplement. It had not responded to the many
        other nutrients that I take. </p>
      <p>One woman with bad allergies reported significant improvement
        and a level of energy she hadn't felt for years. </p>
      <p>One elderly male with severe arrhythmia told me his condition
        had vastly improved in about eight days just from taking olive
        leaf extract alone. A woman with mild arrhythmia said her
        condition improved substantially while she took the supplement
        and then slowly became irregular again after she ran out. </p>
      <p>We know from the oleuropein research done in the 1960s that the
        substance improves blood flood to the heart and acts to
        normalize arrhythmias. Currently, we are learning much about the
        cardiovascular benefits of the phytochemical compounds found in
        grape seeds, onions, kale, green beans, broccoli, and other
        vegetables. It will be interesting to see what benefits the
        particular phytochemicals in olive leaf extract produce for
        heart and arterial health. </p>
      <p>Phil Selinsky, a naturopathic doctor at the Institute for
        Holistic Studies in Santa Barbara, and biochemist Arnold
        Takemoto, who has been developing patient nutritional programs
        on behalf of physicians in Arizona for 15 years, have found
        olive leaf extract to be an effective addition to their array of
        natural healing tools. </p>
      <p>After using the supplement in dozens of cases for over a year,
        Selinsky is impressed with the benefits and looks forward to
        continued use and greater understanding about its most effective
        applications. </p>
      <p>There is no doubt that olive leaf extract has real healing
        power. In a moment I will go into much greater detail on how it
        has helped patients. </p>
      <p>It is important to keep in mind, however, that like any
        nutritional supplement it should not be considered a cure-all or
        panacea. In holistic practices such as mine, individual
        supplements are part of a comprehensive program that includes
        better diet, exercise, and stress control methods. That's how we
        maximize health and minimize symptoms. </p>
      <p>In such a program, a patient may start with supplement X, Y and
        Z, get involved in an exercise program, and experience perhaps
        50 percent relief for a given condition. That's a lot of relief
        but then we keep trying to improve the situation. We now add
        another supplement, let's say the olive leaf extract, and we get
        another degree of improvement, often quite large. In this
        manner, we continually tailor the program of an individual
        patient for the best results. And in this scheme of things,
        olive leaf extract is making a very positive contribution. It
        complements all the good things patients are doing. </p>
      <p>There is always the possiblity that one ingredient, one
        supplement, can fill a large gap or particular need in the body
        and by itself lead to major improvement. We see that happen all
        the time. But usually it is all the elements in a nutritional
        program that work together -- like a team of horses pulling a
        wagon -- that gets the job done most effectively. </p>
      <p>Biochemist Arnold Takemoto puts it this way: "Olive leaf
        extract is not a single magic-bullet. There are very few such
        things, especially in non-pharmaceutical medicine. In many cases
        it takes a whole lot more than just one ingredient to get over a
        particular condition. Yet I find it a very valuable addition
        against chronic fatigue syndrome and many other viral
        conditions, especially those that are more tenacious. It fills a
        hole that we haven't been able to fill before." </p>
      <p>In the Townsend Letter article, Takemoto told Morton Walker
        that he has "yet to discover another herbal substance that
        accomplishes antimicrobially what this substance achieves." </p>
      <p>Takemoto went on to say that Lisa Weinrib, M.D., one of the
        physicians he works with, treats many cases of fibromyalgia and
        chronic fatigue syndrome. </p>
      <p>She has noticed that patients with these problems exhibit much
        improvement from use of the extract, according to Takemoto.
        "It's the missing link that functions as an antiviral and
        antiretroviral agent by slowing down the organism's reproductive
        cycle. A slowdown...allows the patient's immune system to go on
        the attack." </p>
      <p>Takemoto says olive leaf extract has helped patients eliminate
        stubborn viral infections they have had for years. One patient,
        who had suffered from shingles (herpes zoster) for nine years,
        experienced complete relief within two days of starting olive
        leaf extract and other supplements. </p>
      <p>"In my approach," Takemoto says, "I target key antibody
        responses for specific viruses, stimulate the immune system, and
        with olive leaf extract attempt to inhibit the reproduction of
        the virus. It takes everything to get over some of these real
        chronic conditions." </p>
      <p><b>More Energy</b> </p>
      <p>One of the most frequent comments we hear from patients after
        they start taking olive leaf extract is that they feel more
        energetic and have a greater sense of well-being. Many want to
        continue the supplement even after the treatment program has
        cleared up or reduced specific problems. </p>
      <p>Some patients are energized to the point that they inquire
        whether there is an "upper" in the product. There is not. It
        simply generates a natural "upper" effect. Healthy people who
        take it say they also feel this infusion of energy. </p>
      <p>One of my patients is an 18-year-old professional ice-skater
        who says that one or two olive leaf extract tablets a day helps
        her sustain the high energy level she needs for practice and
        performance. </p>
      <p>In my clinic, as in many others, fatigue is the No. 1
        complaint. I am not refering to serious chronic fatigue
        situations but just routine tiredness, likely caused by a
        combination of consuming a dead food diet and not exercising.
        The average person, of course, is not going to change eating
        habits and is not going to go on a regular exercise program. In
        such cases, the olive leaf extract looks like a good source of
        pep for the pepless. </p>
      <p><b>Chronic Fatigue</b> </p>
      <p>In my experience, olive leaf extract also has helped in many
        chronic fatigue cases, even the most serious. One female patient
        described to me what she called a "really quite unbelievable"
        recovery within one month of taking the supplement. </p>
      <p>"For the last few years I have not been feeling like myself.
        I've had little energy and enthusiasm for anything. This is not
        my usual nature. I attributed it to weight, unemployment and
        just being down. My head was always somewhat achy and I couldn't
        figure out why. The only way I could describe it would be as a
        constant low-degree headache which never left. </p>
      <p>"I started taking olive leaf extract and noticed an immediate
        elevation of my spirits. What I liked about the product was that
        it was effective but gentle and didn't make me hyper or unable
        to sleep. Quite the contrary, I slept better. </p>
      <p>"After a few days I began to notice more energy and a stronger
        sense of well-being. The cobwebs in my brain started to
        diminish. I also noticed a bad shoulder and a bad knee started
        to get better. The pain associated with these joints remarkably
        improved. </p>
      <p>"The only side-effects I had were a couple of headaches in the
        beginning which disappeared with some aspirin. I started to feel
        much, much better. It was amazing to see the fatigue disappear
        and my general health improve. I couldnít believe I felt so
        well. I stopped taking the product after 30 days and experienced
        no withdrawal or anything. I simply felt better and that has
        stayed the same for the last 60 days without the product." </p>
      <p>Another female patient with Epstein-Barr Virus reported that
        the supplement "has helped me very much in overcoming the
        tiredness I feel. It has given me energy." </p>
      <p>For some very sick individuals, including people with chronic
        fatigue syndrome or particularly heavy loads of virus or
        bacteria in their bodies, olive leaf extract may possibly
        generate detoxification symptoms -- known as the "die-off
        effect" -- that may be unpleasant. </p>
      <p>Such people may actually feel worse for a short time before
        feeling better. As an example, many chronic fatigue patients
        suffer from an associated depression. Patients of mine who
        toughed it out through the"die-off" period emerged highly
        energized and no longer depressed. </p>
      <p>The "die-off effect," or Herxheimer Reaction as it is medically
        called, refers to symptoms generated by a detoxification
        process. If you are sick and use this product, you should be
        aware of the possibility. For this reason it may be advisable to
        consult first with a holistic health practitioner before using
        it. </p>
      <p>If you have ever used Nystattin to fight yeast infections, you
        are probably familiar with this situation. Nystattin kills
        yeast. As the body becomes full of dead yeast, you may
        experience a variety of detox symptoms. Symptoms may intensify
        to the point where you need to stop or reduce the dosage of the
        medication in order to give your body a chance to eliminate the
        toxic waste. </p>
      <p>Olive leaf extract is potent stuff. It can generate an internal
        cleansing action that may similarly cause significant detox
        symptoms. Refer to the next chapter about what to do if you
        experience such a reaction. </p>
      <p><b>"Die-off" Effect</b> </p>
      <p>"Die-off" symptoms can begin almost immediately after starting
        the supplement. It can hit different people in different ways.
        Reactions include extreme fatigue, diarrhea, headaches,
        muscle/joint achiness or flu-like symptoms. Severity differs
        also from person to person, depending on the extent of
        infection. </p>
      <p>Keep in mind that such symptoms are positive signs.
        Nevertheless, they can be unpleasant. Some people may not want
        to continue because of the discomfort. Others handle it better.
        Others experience no such effect. </p>
      <p>Here's what to do in case of substantial detoxification
        symptoms: </p>
      <ul>
        Reduce the number of tablets, or even stop them altogether for a
        while.
        <p>You may need a day or two, or even a week, to allow your body
          to process the "die-off." </p>
        <p>When you feel better, you can resume the supplement at a low
          dose and increase slowly. </p>
        <p>Holistic practitioners can usually provide a supportive
          detoxification program for individuals who experience a strong
          "die-off" response. In my clinic, this program includes taking
          vitamin C to bowel tolerance. Such a regimen is best done
          under professional guidance.</p>
      </ul>
      Other than the "die-off" detoxification effect among some
      individuals, olive leaf extract appears to create no side effects.
      Past research with calcium elenolate, the derivative or
      oleuropein, included safety studies with laboratory animals. They
      were dosed orally and also via injection. The only symptom
      observed was a mild irritation of the mucous membrane among some
      animals at the injection site. Since olive leaf extract is taken
      orally, this observation is basically irrelevant.
      <p>The research indicated that doses many times higher than
        recommended are unlikely to produce toxic or other adverse side
        effects. During 1993 testing of the liquid form of the product
        against the herpes virus, there were no observed or reported
        side effects. </p>
      <p><b>Potential Against Serious Infectious Diseases</b> </p>
      <p>Deaths from infectious diseases, formerly on the decline, have
        recently taken an alarming upward turn in this country. </p>
      <p>According to federal researchers, such deaths rose by 58% from
        1980 to 1992, pushing this category of illness up behind heart
        disease and cancer in the No. 3 spot of killer diseases. </p>
      <p>While the AIDS epidemic accounts for most of the rise, experts
        say there has been an unusual increase in mysterious respiratory
        infections among the elderly and blood infections among people
        of all ages. When you eliminate the AIDS the death rate during
        the same period for all other infectious diseases rose by 22
        percent. </p>
      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), back in 1978, looked to
        the future and issued a report which contended that by the year
        2000, sources other than Western, technological medicine would
        be needed in order for all people to have adequate health care.
        The organization subsequently adopted the report that
        recommended the use of traditional forms of healing and
        medicine, such as the use of herbs, to meet the demands of an
        factor, exploding global population. </p>
      <p>As we approach the year 2000, the wisdon -- and the urgency --
        of this advice is obvious in the light of the serious
        side-effects and shortcoming of pharmaceutical drugs. </p>
      <p>With the emergence, for instance, of antibiotic-resistant
        bacterial strains, natural products such as olive leaf extract
        take on greater importance. Even if new antibiotics are
        developed, new infectious bacteria would emerge that are
        resistant to new drugs. In the case of herbal medicinals, their
        complex chemistry may often render them potentially more
        effective against a wide variety of microorganisms for which
        pharmaceutical drugs prove to be ineffective. </p>
      <p><b>AIDS</b> </p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see if olive leaf extract can benefit
        AIDS cases. We know that it inhibits the production of reverse
        transcriptase and protease, enzymes necessary for certain
        viruses, such as HIV, to damage healthy cells. </p>
      <p>Informal, preliminary reports are promising. </p>
      <p>Mark Konlee, editor of "Positive Health News," a newletter on
        alternative treatments that circulates widely in the AIDS
        community, has reported exciting initial results with olive leaf
        extract, either in the tablet supplement form or directly as a
        tea brewed from leaves, in combination with other ingredients. </p>
      <p>Those other ingredients, according to Konlee, have been found
        to be highly beneficial over the years. They include: </p>
      <ul>
        Naltrexone, an immune-stabilizing drug used in the treatment of
        heroin and alcohol addiction. Clinical trials conducted by
        Bernard Bihari, MD, a New York City physician specializing in
        HIV/AIDS, demonstrated that this preparation stops the
        progression of the disease and the decline of the immune system
        in a majority of patients who take it regularly. Naltrexone
        stimulates key hormones regulating the immune system and the
        communication between the brain and immune function. No side
        effects have been reported.
        <p>DNCB (dinitrochlorobenzene), a chemical used in photography
          labs that is applied in small doses on the skin. This compound
          acts as anti-viral agent by stimulating killer cell activity.
          An estimated 7,000 patients with AIDS have used this substance
          for some 10 years. </p>
        <p>A blend of olive oil/whole lemon juice. This "grassroots"
          recipe appears to be uniquely helpful in reversing neuropathy,
          swollen lymph nodes and wasting syndrome associated with the
          HIV.</p>

      <p>Konlee reports that the combination, with added olive leaf
        extract, "has producted stunning results," including viral loads
        dropping dramatically within a month. Among the cases he
        describes are these: </p>
      <p>1. A patient had been using Naltrexone since October 1995 along
        with weekly topical applications of DNCB. He had not used the
        olive oil/lemon juice blend. In August of that year he had had a
        CD8 count of 700. CD8 refers to killer T cells, which, along
        with so-called Natural Killer cells, are major immune destroyers
        of virus infected cells. They reduce viral loads and inhibit
        damage to the body's defenses. </p>
      <p>In January of 1996, his CD8 count had risen to 1380. In March
        of 1996 he added olive leaf extract at the standart dose of one
        capsule four times daily. He initially experienced a mild
        headache, a probably "die-off effect." Within days, he reported
        a significant increase in energy along with the disappearance of
        swollen lymph nodes. He said he felt 20 years younger. On March
        21, his CD8 count had soared to 1920! His physician said never
        before in his career had he seen such improvement in an AIDS
        patient. </p>
      <p>2. One patient reported that after finishing a bottle of olive
        leaf extract, one of three Kaposi Sarcoma lesions on his chest
        vanished. He experienced headaches and flu-like symptoms for
        about two weeks, again a probable "die-off effect." Continuing
        with a second bottle, he said the second lesion was completely
        gone and the last one was "fading fast." <br>
        His HIV viral load, as measured by PCR technology, had dropped
        from 160,000 to 30,000 in two months. Soon afterward, he
        reported that his PCR results for HIV were now down to 692. </p>
      <p>3. An HIV patient reported his genital herpes vanished within
        four days of starting on the olive leaf extract. </p>
      <p>4. Another patient with Kaposi's Sarcoma and retinitis added
        five capsules of olive leaf extract daily along with Naltrexone
        and DNCB. After doing this, he said that the sarcoma lesions
        stopped growing. This prompted him to stop two drugs he had been
        taking -- Ganciclovir and Biaxin -- because of severe intestinal
        side effects. A few days after discontinuing the drugs, his
        digestion returned to normal. He soon reported improved vision
        and that lesions were becoming lighter in color. </p>
      <p>5. One patient took the olive leaf extract by itself for about
        3 1/2 months. His HIV viral load dropped nearly in half as a
        result, along with significant improvements in his white blood
        cell counts. After adding Naltrexone and the lemon/olive oil
        drink, his improvement accelerated. </p>
      <p><b>Herpes</b> </p>
      <p>I have recommened olive leaf extract to many patients with
        herpes. The results have been encouraging. </p>
      <p>One man in his early 40s suffered from repeated lesions plus
        fatigue. In a week after starting the supplement, his lesions
        disappeared and his energy level increased. He told me that
        olive leaf extract was the only preparation that had ever
        cleared up the herpes. "Even the most minute blisters are gone,"
        he said. </p>
      <p>A female patient had an unusually stubborn herpetic cold sore
        in the mouth for four months. She also suffered from cancer,
        thus there may have been some significant immune exhaustion
        involved. After one week with the olive leaf, the sore
        disappeared. </p>
      <p>These and other similar clinical successes are consistent with
        a private 1993 herpes study in humans. In that investigation, a
        weaker and ethanol (alcohol-based) form of olive leaf extract
        was used by six individuals with herpes. </p>
      <p>All reported symptomatic relief. </p>
      <p>Three said their lesions disappeared within 48 hours. The
        remaining three, who experienced no improvement, then received a
        stronger dose. One said that three days later, most of the
        lesions were gone. The other two also reported doing better. </p>
      <p>All six subjects said the olive leaf extract produced better
        results than Acyclovir, a medication they had previously used. </p>
      <p><b>Flu and Colds</b> </p>
      <p>Results to date indicate that olive leaf extract may be a good
        weapon against the common cold and flu. Consider the following
        letter written to me in August of 1995 by a female patient
        suffering from persistent flu symptoms: </p>
      <p>"I became ill with the flu in February and had several immune
        boosters, extra vitamins and three antibiotics. My fever was
        102-103 every afternoon and this continued even after the
        antibiotics. I developed paralyzing chest and abdominal pain,
        being confined to the couch for weeks -- not able to hardly
        walk. My weight dropped to 84 pounds. Medical tests revealed
        nothing specifically wrong. </p>
      <p>I started taking olive leaf extract on July 18. Within a few
        days my temperature started dropping and it is slowly and
        steadily going down, so that some days I haven't needed to take
        Tylenol to reduce it. The pain is subsiding gradually and my
        appetite and strength is returning." </p>
      <p>At the time of her next medical examination, the woman's
        temperature had been normal for a week. She hadn't needed
        pain-killers for two weeks. </p>
      <p>I received a striking testimony from an elementary school
        teacher with a history of asthma and vulnerability to colds and
        flu. She felt that olive leaf extract fortified her against the
        constant exposure to germs circulating throughout her classroom.
      </p>
      <p>"I used to get sick all the time," she told me. "One school
        year I got strep throat eight times. If you sneezed at me, the
        chances are I would get sick. Not any more. When many kids in my
        class were coughing, sneezing, and blowing their noses before
        Christmas, I caught a slight cold and that's it." </p>
      <p><b>Bacterial Infections</b> </p>
      <p>The ability of olive leaf extract to destroy bacteria was
        demonstrated dramatically in the case of a 64-year-old physician
        who had been bedridden for several years following a serious
        stroke. He also had recurrent bladder infections which caused
        considerable pain, smelly urine and fever. </p>
      <p>All efforts to alleviate his condition had been generally
        unsuccessful. Even a $1,000 antibiotic specially made for him
        had not worked. He had constant discomfort. His urine was cloudy
        "and looked like soup." Often it was bloody. </p>
      <p>After one month on olive leaf extract, the infections had
        vanished. After six months, the condition has not recurred. </p>
      <p>The doctor also suffered from frequent allergies and colds and
        had to take medication to keep these under control. The
        incidence and severity were significantly minimized with the
        supplement and as a result he requires considerably less
        medicine. </p>
      <p>Naturopath Phil Selinsky reports success against bacterial
        infections in a number of cases. These include sinus and bladder
        infections and oral infections associated with tooth or gum
        disease. </p>
      <p>"Some patients have told me that olive leaf extract took down
        their dental-related infections within hours," according to
        Selinsky. "They were quite impressed by the response." </p>
      <p>The general recommendation for olive leaf extract is four
        tablets daily. For these kind of infections, Selinsky recommends
        patients begin with two tablets followed by another every four
        hours. </p>
      <p>"That usually gets you on top of the situation," he says. For
        more serious infections, tablets can be taken at shorter
        intervals. </p>
      <p>One night a patient of mine developed swelling and intense pain
        from an abscess and decided to take several tablets at one time.
        It reduced the pain. In the morning, when the pain returned, he
        took a "handful" of tablets -- about eight or nine, he guesses.
        An hour-and-a-half later, the pain and swelling were gone. The
        pain did not return but a dental examination determined that the
        involved tooth had to go. </p>
      <p><b>Diabetes</b> </p>
      <p><font size="-0">Researchers have found that the natural olive
          leaf compounds can decrease the level of blood sugar. I have
          had several cases in my clinic confirming this finding.</font>
      </p>
      <p>One involved a 15-year-old girl with juvenile diabetes. The
        teenager had been regularly taking 350 units of insulin daily
        for control. After one month on olive leaf extract, she was able
        to maintain similar control with just 220 units. </p>
      <p>In another case, the blood sugar level of a diabetic elderly
        priest dropped from 450 to 160 after three months. In an yet
        another instance, the blood sugar of a middle aged man
        stabilized at 140, down from 250, after one month. He reported a
        great increase in energy during this time. </p>
      <p>These results are exciting. I look forward to more
        opportunities to gauge the benefits of olive leaf for diabetics.
        Will it generate improved blood flow and antioxidant effects to
        help against the destructive vascular complications of diabetes
        that contribute to stroke, heart disease and peripheral
        circulatory problems? </p>
      <p>Time will tell. </p>
      <p><b>Rheumatoid Arthritis</b> </p>
      <p>A number of patients have experienced significant easing of
        joint pain. We don't know yetprecisely how this is happening. </p>
      <p>A male patient, who had been diagnosed with rheumatoid
        arthritis five years before, had this to say: "After taking all
        the medicines I could stand with no real results, I was informed
        about some nutritional supplements. One of them was an olive
        leaf extract.' "After taking it for three weeks I noticied more
        flexibility in my fingers, elbows, and neck. There was marked
        relief of muscle tension surrounding my joints. Overall I am
        enjoying olive leaf extract with my daily routine." </p>
      <p><b>Multiple Symptoms</b> </p>
      <p>One of our clinical observations is that olive leaf extract
        appears to work on many different levels in the body. As a
        result we often hear reports from patients that a variety of
        symptoms begin improving. </p>
      <p>One woman with chronic fatigue, frequent colds, asthma, and
        vaginal yeast infections said that all her symptoms had
        virtually cleared up within five weeks. The woman, a teacher,
        was able to take on new projects she wouldn't even begin to
        think were possible before. </p>
      <p>A male patient wrote a detailed letter about his experience: </p>
      <p>"I became ill in December 1993 and was diagnosed with a stomach
        and prostrate infection. I was treated with high doses of
        antibiotics, but never fully recovered. I was troubled with
        multiple symptoms, some of which were back and neck pain,
        fatigue, flu-like symptoms, swollen glands, sinus and digestive
        problems. I was subsequently diagnosed with fibromyalgia
        (chronic fatigue syndrome) and the physicians recommeded
        Prozac-type antidepressants and anti-inflammatory drugs. But I
        refused them. I began taking olive leaf extract along with my
        regular vitamin and mineral supplements in August of 1995 at the
        rate of one tablet every six hours. I increased the dosage after
        five days and began to feel better." </p>
      <p>"I tried different dosages for a number of days until I found
        the optimum amount for me. Today I take three tablets four times
        a day. My overall health has greatly improved and so has my
        energy and disposition. One very interesting thing has occurred.
        My finger nails were infected, by whatever infection I had,
        leaving them wrinkled looking. Now they are slowly returning to
        their normal shape." </p>
      <p>A female patient, after taking olive leaf extract for a month,
        gave me this happy report: </p>
      <p>"It has improved my allergy-like psoriasis, and symptoms of a
        kidney infection. I have been having back aches for almost a
        year and frequent urination. These have improved a lot also. </p>
      <p><b>Fungus and Yeast Infections</b> </p>
      <p>Earlier I mentioned my own positive experience with olive leaf
        extract. I started taking the supplement and it completely
        cleared up a stubborn toenail fungus infection. A number of
        other patients have told me similar stories. </p>
      <p>A woman with an infection of the large toenail said that within
        60 days her condition was about three-quarters healed. For five
        years, she had tried many types of medication and natural agents
        without help. </p>
      <p>More than 10 million Americans are said to have disfiguring
        fungal nail infections, a widely ignored medical problem. It is
        frequently found among patients with AIDS, cancer and diabetes,
        athletes, elderly individuals, people who spend considerable
        time standing or who wear the same shoes day after day, or who
        wear artificial fingernails. Drugs taken for cancer and AIDS
        lower resistance and are believed to make people more
        susceptible to infection. </p>
      <p>For the first time in 35 years, a new drug has been approved
        for the condition. It is called Sporanox and is reported to be
        more effective than previous anti-fungal preparations. But none
        of these preparations come cheap. Patricia Anstett of the
        Knight-Ridder Newspapers reports that two 100-milligram pills of
        Sproranox are taken daily for about three months at a cost of
        $900. Older drugs, taken for 12 months or more, cost double or
        more that amount over the longer duration. Even with the new
        drug, the condition may return if the medication is stopped. </p>
      <p>Olive leaf extract may offer a natural -- and for sure, less
        expensive -- method of self-treatment. </p>
      <p>One patient said a fungal infection of the tongue he had for 30
        years responded virtually overnight to the olive leaf. "I had
        tried all kinds of diets, treatments and regimes but to no
        avail," he told me. "Within three weeks on olive leaf extract
        the fungus disappeared!" </p>
      <p>More than a dozen patients with candidiasis have reported
        significant improvements. They say they have fewer infections,
        allergic reactions, less dullness and more energy. One woman
        said she was finally able to clean out her dust-ridden garage.
        Before olive leaf extract that would have been impossible for
        her. </p>
      <p>One 36-year-old woman, who had suffered repeated vaginal yeast
        infections for several years, told me this account of her
        experience with olive leaf extract: </p>
      <p>"I have seen several doctors using conventional medicine. They
        prescribed every medication available to combat yeast, all to no
        avail. After less than three weeks of taking the olive leaf
        supplement, all symptoms cleared up and have not returned. As a
        sufferer of herpes simplex II, I would experience outbreaks
        several times a year. Now, I have had no more flare-ups." <br>
        Skin Conditions <br>
        A chronic scalp infection that had stubbornly resisted all
        treatment for more than 10 year responded directly to olive leaf
        extract within 60 days. The patient wrote me this detailed
        letter: </p>
      <p>"The condition would flare up causing very painful eruptions
        and lesions in my scalp, which, over time, have killed quite a
        few hair follicles. Modern medical doctors and dermatologists
        have been unable to eradicate (the condition). I had resolved my
        self to the fact that there was no cure. </p>
      <p>"I am satisfied that I am getting some significant results from
        using the olive leaf extract. My scalp remains a little tender,
        but the eruptions have all but ceased. I am continuing to use
        the product about twice a day, and the skin color is much
        healthier than it has been in recent time. </p>
      <p>"No matter what drug therapy my doctors have prescribed in the
        past, none has provided me with the level of relief I am
        currently experiencing. I would gladly recommend this product to
        others suffering chronic skin aliments." </p>
      <p>A female patient reported better energy and disappearance of a
        rash in 30 days. The rash occurred in winter, or during times of
        extreme cold. </p>
      <p><b>Tropical Illnesses</b> </p>
      <p>Olive leaf extract may offer considerable potential in the
        treatment of tropical infections such as malaria and dengue. <br>
        Malaria is caused by parasitic protozoans injected into the body
        by infected mosquitoes. Protozoans, in case you are interested,
        are one-celled organisms, the simplest creatures in the animal
        kingdom. </p>
      <p>As far back as 1827, reports have appeared in medical
        literature indicating the benefits of olive leaf extract in the
        treatment of malaria. In 1906, one report stated that olive
        leaves were, in fact, superior to quinine for malarial
        infections. Quinine was preferred, however, because it was
        easier to administer. In studies performed by the Upjohn
        company, calcium elenolate, the substance within oleuropein, was
        found to be effective against the malaria protozoa. </p>
      <p>Now in tablet form, there may be renewed interest in olive leaf
        extract as an anti-malarial agent. Preliminary reports from
        Latin America are promising. </p>
      <p>A full-fledged case of malaria at a clinic in Mexico was
        totally cured with a dosage schedule of two olive leaf extract
        supplements every six hours. A clinic report said that the
        34-year-old female patient made a steady recovery and after six
        months, "she was without any of the malaria symptoms, not even
        anemia or shivers. Her breath is good. Her state of mind
        excellent and she does not show any signs of chronic or
        contagious disease." </p>
      <p>Malaria has been reported recently in Texas and continues to be
        a leading cause of illness and deaths worldwide, particularly
        because of the development of drug-resistant strains. "It is a
        continuing concern in the United States because of increased
        international migration, travel, and commerce, " according to
        the publication <b>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports</b>.
      </p>
      <p>Another serious tropical disease giving concern to public
        health officials is dengue fever. This ailment is also
        mosquito-borne, in this case caused by a virus, and occurs
        mainly in tropical Asia and the Caribbean. It can cause
        vomiting, high fever, loss of appetite, and abdominal pain, and
        is deadly in 50 percent of the cases. Some 50 million people are
        affected each year and about half a million require
        hospitalization, according to the World Health Organization.
        Researchers are trying to find a vaccine but no breakthroughs
        have occurred yet. </p>
      <p>In 1995, large outbreaks of dengue were reported by health
        authorities in 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries. </p>
      <p><b>Dosages</b> </p>
      <p>Olive leaf extract is currently available in the form of 500
        mg. tablets. The routine dosage is one tablet every six hours or
        four throughout the day. Take the supplement between meals for
        best results. </p>
      <p>In the case of bad colds or flu, you can use two tablets every
        six hours. For acute infections, some individuals have taken
        more -- three and even four every six hours -- and reported
        rapid relief. </p>
      <p>If you encounter a "die-off" effect, cut back on the number of
        tablets you are taking or temporarily discontinue them. See the
        section on "die-off effect." </p>
      <p>For healthy folks seeking more energy or the prevention
        benefits of olive leaf extract, we suggest one or two tablets a
        day. The younger and cleaner the body, the more responsive it is
        to supplements such as this. When a person becomes older and
        more toxic, more of the supplement is required to do the job. </p>

        Abstract -- The invention relates to a method of obtaining
        high-value-added compounds from olive leaves. The inventive
        method comprises the following steps, namely: a first step in
        which the leaves are subjected to solid-liquid extraction with
        organic solvents, preferably hexane or ethanol, and the crude
        extract thus obtained is vacuum concentrated; and a second step
        in which the crude extract is fractionated by means of
        supercritical CO2 countercurrent column extraction and
        separation into two cells with different fixed pressure and/or
        temperature conditions which alter the dissolving power of the
        CO2, thereby precipitating different compounds. The invention
        can be used to extract natural products of interest from olive
        leaves for the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries,
        such as waxes, squalene, beta -carotene, alpha -tocopherol,
        oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol and other phenolic compounds, beta
        -sitosterol, alpha - and beta -amyrin, erythrodiol, uvaol and
        other terpenic alcohols, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid and
        maslinic acid, among others. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The olive tree and other members of the family Oleaceae have
        been documented as a source of medicinal substances since
        biblical times. Many researchers have studied the cocktail of
        phytogenic substances produced by the olive and other members of
        this family. One compound that has received particular attention
        from the research community is a glucoside known as oleuropein.
        A number of scientific studies have shown this compound to have
        certain anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial properties
        (Koutsoumanis; el al., 1998; Aziz, et al., 1998; Tranter, et
        al., 1993; Tassou, et al., 1995), anti-oxidant properties (de la
        Puerta, et al., 1999; Visiola, 1998a), and anti-inflammatory
        properties (Visioli, et al., 1998b). Interest in natural
        anti-oxidants is increasing because of the growing body of
        evidence indicating the involvement of oxygen-derived free
        radicals in several pathologic processes, such as cancer and
        atherosclerosis. </p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, the market for oleuropein is quite
        substantial. Dietary supplements containing oleuropein are
        readily obtainable via mail-order catalogs and the internet.
        Currently, most of the oleuropein commercially available to
        consumers is derived from olive leaves. To date, the fruit of
        the olive plant, which is rich in oleuropein, has largely been
        ignored as a source of oleuropein due to certain problems
        associated with the production of olive oil, discussed below. </p>
      <p>Conventionally, olive oil production involves crushing olives,
        including the pits, to produce a thick paste. During this
        procedure, the crushed olives are continuously washed with
        water, a process known as "malaxation." The paste is then
        mechanically pressed to squeeze out the oil content. In addition
        to providing olive oil, the pressing also squeezes out the
        paste's water content. Such washing and pressing steps yield a
        considerable amount of water, referred to as "vegetation water."
      </p>
      <p>Both the pit and the pulp of olives are rich in water-soluble,
        phenolic compounds. Such compounds are extracted from olives
        during malaxation, according to their partition coefficients,
        and end up in the vegetation water. This explains why various
        polyphenolic compounds, such as oleuropein and its derivatives,
        produced in olive pulp, can be found in abundance in vegetation
        waters. Similarly, a number of monophenolic compounds, such as
        tyrosol and its derivatives, produced in olive pits, are also
        abundant in vegetation waters. </p>
      <p>Oleuropein and its derivatives are readily degraded into
        breakdown products (e.g., upon exposure to air/oxygen, certain
        enzymes or bacteria) that are substantially non-polluting and
        non-toxic. Tyrosol and its derivatives, on the other hand, are
        substantially resistant to air/oxygen, bacterial and enzymatic
        degradation and are of a highly polluting nature. Unfortunately,
        current technology does not permit the isolation of oleuropein
        and its derivatives from such highly polluting monophenolic
        compounds in vegetation waters except through time-consuming and
        expensive separation processes. For these reasons, vegetation
        waters are currently treated as waste and are discarded without
        realizing their content of oleuropein. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>One aspect of the present invention provides a method of
        producing vegetation water from olives, the vegetation water
        containing oleuropein substantially free of monophenolic
        compounds from olive pits, comprising the steps of: </p>
      <p>separating olive pits from olives to obtain a pitless olive
        pulp; </p>
      <p>pressing the pitless olive pulp to obtain a liquid-phase
        mixture including water, oil, and olive pulp components; </p>
      <p>separating the water component from the oil and olive pulp
        components of the liquid-phase mixture to obtain a water
        component substantially free of oil and olive pulp; and, </p>
      <p>collecting the separated water component. </p>
      <p>According to one related embodiment, moisture is removed from
        the separated water component to obtain an increased
        concentration of oleuropein. </p>
      <p>According to another related embodiment, the separated water
        component is dried to obtain a powder containing oleuropein. The
        powder containing oleuropein may be encapsulated into a gelatin
        capsule. </p>
      <p>Another aspect of the invention provides a composition,
        prepared according to the method of the invention, which
        comprises oleuropein substantially free of monophenolic
        compounds from olive pits. </p>
      <p>A further aspect of the invention provides a method for
        obtaining oleuropein from olives, substantially free of
        monophenolic compounds from olive pits, which comprises the

      <p>These and other features and advantages of the present
        invention will become clear from the following description. </p>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>One aspect of the present invention provides olive-derived
        vegetation water that is substantially free of monophenolic
        compounds from olive pits. To obtain such vegetation water, the
        invention provides for the removal of the pits or seeds from the
        olives prior to pressing. The pitless pulp or meat is then
        pressed to obtain a liquid-phase mixture including olive oil,
        vegetation water, and solid by-products. Thereafter, the
        vegetation water is separated from the rest of the liquid-phase
        mixture and collected. </p>
      <p>It should be appreciated the vegetation water produced in this
        manner is substantially free of compounds that are found
        primarily in olive pits, such as tyrosol and other highly
        polluting, monophenolic compounds. The vegetation water thus
        obtained may be used, for example, in a variety of ways not
        amenable to conventional vegetation water. For example,
        vegetation water obtained by the method of the present invention
        can be used: (i) as a natural anti-bacterial, anti-viral and/or
        fungicidal product for agricultural and/or pest control
        applications, (ii) as a raw material for the production of
        oleuropein and other anti-oxidants for a variety of medical
        purposes (e.g., holistic medicine), and (iii) as a therapeutic
        and/or an antioxidant beverage for a variety of health purposes.
      </p>
      <p>According to one embodiment, a batch of olives is processed to
        remove the pit from each fruit. The pitless pulp is then
        mechanically pressed to yield a liquid-phase mixture including
        olive oil, vegetation waters, and solid by-products. The solid
        by-products are substantially removed from the liquid-phase
        mixture by filtration and/or centrifugation. Next, the oil and
        aqueous fractions are then allowed to segregate. The aqueous
        phase is then decanted and saved for further use. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment, the pitless olive pulp is mixed with water
        or an alcohol/water solution to produce an extract substantially
        free of chemicals associated with the olive pits or seeds, such
        as tyrosol and its derivatives. </p>
      <p>The vegetation water or extract may be concentrated by
        distillation under vacuum. The concentrate may be dried by spray
        drying or oven drying under vacuum to obtain a powder containing
        oleuropein. It may be desirable to conduct such steps at a
        temperature no greater than about 88 degrees Celsius to avoid
        degradation of the glucoside. The oleuropein can then be
        purified, for example, by chromatographic separation procedures.
        The oleuropein content may be tested by standard thin layer
        chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatography methods.
      </p>
      <p>Techniques suitable for concentrating and/or isolating
        oleuropein from aqueous and aqueous-alcoholic solutions are
        taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,714,150, expressly
        incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>The olives processed according to the method disclosed herein
        may be pitted by any suitable means. The pits may be separated
        from the pulp manually or in an automated manner. Preferably,
        such means should be capable of segregating the pits without
        breaking them, which might otherwise cause sharp pieces to
        become embedded in the olive meat. </p>
      <p>For purposes of commercial production, it may be desirable to
        automate various aspects of the invention. In this regard, one
        embodiment contemplates the use of an apparatus as disclosed in
        U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,452,744, 4,522,119 and 4,370,274, each to Finch
        et al., and each expressly incorporated herein by reference.
        Briefly, Finch et al. teach an apparatus for recovering olive
        oil from olives. Initially, olives are fed to a pulper that
        separates the olive pits from the olives to obtain a pitless
        olive meat. The meat is then taken up by an extraction screw
        that subjects the meat to an extraction pressure sufficient to
        withdraw a liquid phase, comprising oil, water and a minor
        proportion of olive pulp. The liquid phase is collected in a bin
        and then sent to a clarifying centrifuge that separates the pulp
        from the liquid phase to obtain a mixture comprising olive oil
        and water. A purifying centrifuge then separates the water and a
        small proportion of solid matter from the mixture to obtain an
        olive oil, substantially free of water, that is collected in a
        tank. According to Finch et al., the water is put to a disposal
        means such as a sewer. The present invention, in sharp contrast,
        provides for the collection, saving and use of the vegetation
        waters. </p>
      <p>Additional devices that may be used in practicing the present
        invention are disclosed in Italian Patent Nos. 1276576 and
        1278025, each expressly incorporated herein by reference. As
        above, these devices can be used to separate the pulp from the
        pits prior to processing of the crushed olive pulp into oil,
        water, and solid residues. </p>
      <p>As previously described, a number of uses are contemplated for
        vegetation waters obtained in accordance with the method of this
        invention. In one exemplary embodiment, the vegetation water, or
        a concentrate or isolate thereof, is administered to a mammalian
        subject, such as a person desirous of one or more of the
        benefits associated with oleuropein. </p>
      <p>The oleuropein obtained by the method of the invention can be
        administered orally or parenterally. Oral dosage forms can be in
        a solid or liquid form. Such dosage forms can be formulated from
        purified oleuropein or they can be formulated from aqueous or
        aqueous-alcoholic extracts. Regarding the latter, aqueous or
        aqueous-alcoholic (e.g., water-methanol or water-ethanol)
        extracts can be spray-dried to provide a dry powder that can be
        formulated into oral dosage forms with other pharmaceutically
        acceptable carriers. </p>
      <p>The solid oral dosage form compositions in accordance with this
        invention are prepared in a manner well known in the
        pharmaceutical arts, and comprise oleuropein in combination with
        at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In making such
        compositions, oleuropein, either in substantially pure form or
        as a component of a raw distillate or extract, are usually
        mixed, diluted or enclosed with a carrier. The carrier can be in
        a solid form, semi-solid or liquid material which acts as a
        vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient.
        Alternatively, the carrier can be in the form of a capsule or
        other container to facilitate oral administration. Thus, the
        solid oral dosage forms for administration in accordance with
        the present invention can be in the form of tablets, pills,
        powders or soft or hard gelatin capsules. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, the oleuropein obtained in accordance with this
        invention for oral administration can be in liquid form wherein
        the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is water or an
        aqueous-alcoholic medium. </p>
      <p>The compositions for administration in the present invention
        can also be formulated with other common pharmaceutically
        acceptable excipients, including lactose, dextrose, sucrose,
        sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gums, calcium silicate,
        microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
        methylcellulose, water, alcohol and the like. The formulations
        can additionally include lubricating agents such as talc,
        magnesium stearate and mineral oil, wetting agents, emulsifying
        and suspending agents, preserving agents such as methyl- and
        propylhydroxybenzoates, sweetening agents or flavoring agents.
        Further, the compositions of the present invention can be
        formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release
        of the active ingredient after administration to a subject. </p>
      <p>Parenteral formulations for use in accordance with the present
        invention are prepared using standard techniques in the art.
        They are commonly prepared as sterile injectable solutions,
        using a parenterally acceptable carrier such as isotonic saline
        solution or as a sterile packaged powder prepared for
        reconstitution with sterile buffer or isotonic saline prior to
        administration to a subject. </p>
      <p>Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing
        description that the broad teachings of the present invention
        can be implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this
        invention has been described in connection with particular
        embodiments and examples thereof, the true scope of the
        invention should not be so limited. Various changes and
        modification may be made without departing from the scope of the
        invention, as defined by the appended claims.<br>
