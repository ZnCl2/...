          portable, hand held tool for trimming and electrifying
          vegetation. The portable, hand swingable, weed trimmer passes
          electricity through its cutting or trimming element so as to
          pass electricity into the weeds to kill the roots of the
          weeds. The tool includes a power unit for rotation of a cutter
          drive. A pancake generator generates electricity via rotation
          of the cutter drive. Brushes between the pancake generator and
          the cutter blade conduct current to the cutter blade, which in
          turn permits the current to pass into the vegetation as the
          cutter blade trims the vegetation.</font> </p>

          for the manipulation of a biological material [seeds] by a
          magnetic field is presented. The device comprises a magnetic
          field source coupled to a current source. The current source
          is of a kind supplying an electric current of at least two
          electrical degree shifted phases. The magnetic field source
          comprises a two-part inductor, each inductor part producing a
          coordinate varying magnetic field (CVMF). Each inductor part
          is formed by at least two conductors aligned in a spaced-apart
          relationship, wherein each of the at least two conductors is
          connectable to a different phase of the current source, and
          has two spaced-apart parts arranged such that when the
          conductor is connected to the current source, the electric
          current flows in its two parts in opposite directions,
          respectively. The conductors of each inductor part are
          arranged such that each two locally adjacent conductor parts
          are associated with two different phases of the electric
          current source. A distance between the two conductor parts
          coupled to the same phase of the current source defines a
          half-wavelength .lambda./2 of a wave of magnetic induction of
          the CVMF. This distance is selected in accordance with a
          predetermined relation between the wavelength .lambda. and an
          effective space .DELTA. within the magnetic field region
          defined by the dimensions of the biological material and its
          distance from the magnetic field source.<br>
