      <center><b>Lord Rayleigh // William Strutt</b></center>
      <p>In the 1930s and 40s, Lord Rayleigh reported to the Royal
        Society of London about his experiments with active
        (electrically excited) nitrogen and other gases. In 1940, he
        gave an account of his discovery of the anomalous energy
        released by active nitrogen at reduced pressure. He explained
        the anomaly in the abstract of his second paper published on the
        subject in 1940, thus: </p>
      <p>"The amount of energy collected from the gas was surprisingly
        large, and is difficult to reconcile with existing theories of
        the nature of active nitrogen. In some cases the energy was as
        high as 10 eV for every molecule of nitrogen that passed through
        the discharge. [Later research raised the energy level up to 223
        eV/mol.] This quantity of energy can with difficulty be
        accounted for by dissociation, even if it occurred to the extent
        of 100%." </p>
      <p>In addition, he showed that "pieces of sheet gold, copper,
        silver or platinum may be made red hot or even melted by
        exposing them to active nitrogen produced in a low-pressure
        discharge. The nitrogen gives up its energy to the metal, which
        remains unacted on... Gold was selected as the most active
        metal...." </p>
      <p>"The energy radiated as after-glow under favourable conditions
        is only of the order of 10нн<sup>-3</sup> of the energy
        collected by the metal." This extra energy was about 1000 times
        the amount radiated by active nitrogen alone under the most
        favorable experimental conditions he devised. </p>
      <p>"The after-glow consists chiefly of three heads of the first
        positive nitrogen bands. The maximum luminosity of the visual
        spectrum is at 5550, and the wavelengths of the bands in
        question and their luminosities in terms of this maximum are as
        follows: </p>

      </p>
      <p>"The question may be raised whether the 'a' system of bands
        have great energy in the infra-red... We may fairly infer [based
        on the work of Kichlu and Acharya (1929)] that the infra-red
        contribution is not important." </p>
      <p>Rayleigh calculated the "theoretical maximum for integrated
        nitrogen after-glow" to be 4.82 x 10<sup>2</sup> candle-sec.,
        and used this number as a standard datum for his studies. He
        noted: </p>
      <p>"Although the luminosity in the bulb remains visible for hours,
        its equivalent duration at the initial intensity is only about 3
        seconds. The prolonged faint luminosity contributes very little
        to the total." </p>
      <p>Lord Rayleigh also studied the effects of increasing and
        reducing the concentration of nitrogen, injecting active
        nitrogen into inert nitrogen, temperature change, other gases
        and metals, and the "wall-effect". </p>
      <p>In 1946, Rayleigh published a sequel study on "The surprising
        amount of energy which can be collected from gases after the
        electric discharge has passed." In the abstract of the article,
        he stated: </p>
      <p>"A new form of experiment is now described... in which... a
        platinum strip is kept hot by periodic discharges... [B]y making
        the experiment (1) with the Pt exposed to the gas and (2) with
        the Pt protected by a thin glass sheath it is possible to
        determine what part of the total energy is to be attributed to
        catalytic action of the discharge products. This amount of
        energy was found to be very great. Reckoning in electron volts
        per molecule of gas present it increased rapidly as the gas
        pressure was lowered and at the lowest pressure used it rose as
        high as 223 eV/mol. Results of the same order were obtained with
        other gases, so it is not clear that the glow of active nitrogen
        is the essential condition. This great liberation of energy much
        exceeds what can be explained by dissociation of the molecules
        and single ionization of every atom which results, which would
        only afford 36 eV." (Figure 1) </p>
      <p>"To produce the electrodeless discharges, the same oil
        condensor was used as in my previous work. It was charged with
        an induction coil with a slow mercury break... An ebonite wheel
        with a conducting segment is mounted on an axle which is
        inclined at 45<sup>o</sup> to the horizontal. This wheel is
        immersed in Hg and makes and breaks contact once a revolution.
        The Hg is covered with a layer of alcohol... </p>
      <p>"Along the axis [of the discharge vessel] there is stretched a
        Pt strip, over which a glass sheath can be slipped. The Pt can
        be heated by a current from a battery, and the tube is wound
        with a wire coil, which is used to excite the electrodeless
        discharge. When the discharge passes, the Pt strip gets heated,
        and its resistance increases. This is attributed partly to the
        direct-heating action of the discharge, and partly to the action
        of the Pt strip in catalyzing the discharge products (ions and
        dissociated atoms?). </p>
      <p>"During an experiment, the Pt strip is kept at an arbitrary but
        constant resistance of <i>R</i> ohms. For this purpose it is
        made one arm of a Wheatstone's bridge, and the current is
        adjusted to heat the strip until the given resistance is
        attained. The current (C<sub>1 </sub>amp.) is measured. Then
        the glass sheath is slipped into position, so as to screen the
        wire from dissociation products. A larger current (C<sub>2</sub>
        amp.) must now be passed to restore the resistance to its
        standard value of <i>R</i> ohms. The energy given up to the Pt
        wire by the dissociation products is&nbsp;&nbsp; (C<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>-C<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>)
        <i>Rt</i> W-sec., when <i>t</i> is the time interval in seconds
        from one discharge to the next. </p>
      <p>"This energy is derived from, and therefore is contained in,
        the gas volume<i> v</i> at pressure<i> p</i> cm. of Hg. </p>
      <p>"Thus the energy per unit volume reckoned as at atmospheric
        pressure is </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




        (C<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>-C<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>) <i>Rt</i>
        x 76 / W-sec./cc. <i>vp</i> </p>
      <p>"In a typical experiment, when the conditions were adjusted to
        get the best effect at the chosen pressure, C<sub>1н</sub> =
        0.78 amp., C<sub>2</sub> = 1.73 amp., <i>R </i>= 0.470 ohm, <i>t</i>
        = 0.25 sec., <i>v</i> = 19 cc., <i>p</i> = 2.6 x 10<sup>-3</sup>
        cm. Hg. In this case the energy is 432 W-sec./cc. as at N.T.P.,
        or 98.5 eV/mol. of N present." </p>
      <p>Rayleigh calculated that the probable length of travel of the
        molecules of nitrogen, from the point where they received energy
        to central strip where they gave it up, to be about 1 cm. (the
        radius of the discharge vessel). </p>
      <p>"The duration of the discharge (several oscillations) was
        estimated... and found to be 3.76 x 10<sup>-6</sup> sec.. This
        requires the molecule considered to have a velocity of... 5 x 10<sup>5</sup>
        cm./sec.. Now the molecular velocity of nitrogen is 5 x 10<sup>4</sup>
        cm./sec. at 273 K. To raise it 10 times, the absolute
        temperature must be increased 100 times, i.e. to the temperature
        of the hottest stars. It seems clear, therefore, that a molecule
        could not travel fast enough to give up energy to the Pt strip
        more than once during the short duration of a discharge. If not,
        it must carry 98.5 eV at one time and it is not easy to see how
        according to current ideas how it could do this. The energy of
        dissociation of nitrogen is 7.4 (?) V, and this, together with
        the ionization of both the atoms, would only afford 7.4 + 2 x
        14.5 V or 36 V. Considering that the discharge gives a band
        spectrum and not a line spectrum, the idea of complete
        dissociation and ionization is somewhat fantastic; but even if
        we make this assumption the difficulty remains. </p>
      <p>"There appears to be no advantage in increasing the number of
        turns to the maximum, and close winding was inconvenient,
        because the coil showed a tendency to spark over. A coil having
        26.5 turns was used in further experiments, as being about the
        useful maximum. </p>
      <p>"The pressure was then varied, leaving the other conditions
        unaltered: </p>
      <center>
        <p><font color="#ff0000">[Table not shown in the online version]</font></p>
      </center>
      <p>"It appears, therefore, that the energy per molecule increases
        very greatly as the pressure is diminished. </p>
      <p>"It was of interest to see whether these very large values of
        the energy per molecule are peculiar to nitrogen, or whether
        they would be found in other gases also. A few results only are
        available at present: </p>

      <p>"These are of the same order of magnitude as the results for
        nitrogen, one of which is repeated for convenience of
        reference." </p>
      <p>The high energy output of this relatively simple experiment
        suggests that a convenient source of "free energy" might be
        available therein. Aside from that notion, despite repeated
        reading of Rayleigh's articles on active nitrogen, this writer
        remains baffled as to how active N, O or H could possibly form
        Mass 5 as claimed by Ron Kovac (<i>Infinite Energy</i> #15/16,
        July-Nov. 1997 and elsewhere). Kovac does not explain the
        reaction pathway(s) involved. </p>

      <p><i>Proc. Roy. Soc.</i> (London) A-180: 123-139 (1942) ~
        "Further Studies on Active Nitrogen: Experiments to show that
        traces of oxygen or other impurity affect primarily the walls of
        the vessel, and not the phenomena in the gas space." </p>
      <p>When a minute O<sub>2</sub> tributary is added to the N<sub>2</sub>
        gas stream it takes longer to assert its action than the time
        needed to change the gas composition, which indicates that the
        effect on the O<sub>2</sub> tributary is on the walls of the
        tube. The fact that when the O<sub>2</sub> tributary is checked
        the action persists confirms this view. The O<sub>2</sub>
        modifies the glass wall favorably for the accumulation of active
        N. The restoration of the afterglow by a tributary O<sub>2</sub>
        stream is very marked with electrodeless discharges at 0.3 mm.
        An increase of intensity by a factor of 32 is achieved by the
        introduction of the O<sub>2</sub>. The observed phenomena are
        complex and not easy to explain. The effect of treating the
        vessel is examined. Strong preliminary heating in vacuo makes a
        vessel destroy the afterglow, Heating in N<sub>2</sub> at
        atmospheric pressure has the same effect. Heating in O<sub>2</sub>
        at even 1 mm pressure restores the glow. The effects can be
        explained in terms of gas-layer formation or removal. The
        behavior of the gas away from the surface is different; in this
        case purity of N<sub>2</sub> favors the promotion of active N
        phenomena. </p>
      <p><i>Ibid</i>., pp. 140-150 ~ "The ionization associated with
        active nitrogen" </p>
      <p>The ionization associated with afterglowing N is investigated
        thoroughly. The ionization is completely cut off if the test
        vessel is separated from the afterglow by a silica wall. The
        ionization is thus not produced by light (at least of wavelength
        greater than 1850 A). No increased current is observed when the
        surface action is such as to make a testing cathode red hot.
        This seems to exclude electron emission as the cause of the
        ionization. The ionization is nearly the same when the cathode
        is one of the common metals or a surface coated with
        meta-phosphoric acid, but a copper cathode, when clean, gives a
        much larger effect. It is concluded that the surface electron
        emission is small compared with the volume ionization of the gas
        space. The number of ion pairs generated and the number of
        photons emitted per cc at various stages of a decaying glow are
        measured. The number of photons is at first greater but at very
        low intensities the number of ions probably exceeds the number
        of photons. It is considered that different mechanisms are
        involved in the two processes. The admission of inert N<sub>2</sub>
        increases the instantaneous photon emission and also the
        instantaneous ionization. Evidence is produced which points to
        the fact that the ionization process and afterglow process are
        in some measure independent. The ionization potential of the N<sub>2</sub>
        molecule (15.51 v) is such that the energy attributed to active
        N<sub>2</sub> on spectroscopic grounds, as calculated from the
        emitted band spectrum, is open to suspicion. It is considered
        that previous attempts to explain active N<sub>2</sub> have laid
        too much stress on the spectroscopic aspect and have ignored the
        question of ionization. This was previously considered a
        subordinate phenomenon, but the work here shows that under some
        conditions ionization may involve as many atoms as the light
        emission.<br>
