              Peripheral Vision</font></b> </p>
        <p>by<b> Nelson Zink and Stephen Parks</b> </p>
      </center>
      <p>It all began one afternoon a couple of years ago. We were
        talking about people who have the ability to see farther or more
        deeply or more clearly than the rest of us, those exceptional
        individuals who can easily master complexity and ambiguity and
        arrive at startling insights. </p>
      <p>We began to speculate on the possibility that these people
        weren't just smarter or more creative than the average person
        but perhaps literally saw the world in a different manner. As we
        looked for direct connections between the literal and figurative
        meanings of words like sight and vision, it slowly became
        apparent that we were onto something. </p>
      <p>We reviewed the physiology of sight and discovered that neural
        structures exist within the eye which facilitate a way of seeing
        that is radically dissimilar from the one we're accustomed to
        using. We confirmed that there is, indeed, a neurological basis
        for a distinct "second" type of sight, and that this way of
        seeing is available to all of us all the time. (Usually we are
        so absorbed with our focused vision that we're unaware of its
        power.) </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Perpheral vision</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Could peripheral vision possibly be related to Vision, to
        Insight, to all those capitalized powers of perception?
        Searching for references that might shed light on second sight,
        we found that while many individuals weren't particularly aware
        of how they accomplished their achievements, the reports
        contained eery similarities. </p>
      <p>We found a succession of texts from the Taoists of early China
        through the books of Carlos Castaneda that spoke of a certain
        kind of all-seeing gaze. It was often difficult to determine
        whether the authors were speaking literally or metaphorically,
        but it was perfectly clear in the case of Miyamoto Muksashi, the
        legendary swordsman of fifteenth century Japan, who had the
        clearest and most insightful description of the powers of
        peripheral vision we found. </p>
      <p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">The Book of Five Rings</span>,
        Musashi refers to the two types of sight which he calls Ken and
        Kan. </p>
      <p>Ken registers the movements of surface phenomena; it's the
        observation of superficial appearence. </p>
      <p>Kan is the profound examination of the essence of things,
        seeing through or into. For Musashi, Ken is seeing with the
        eyes, Kan is seeing with the mind. </p>
      <p>The difference is akin to that of style versus substance.
        Musashi gives instructions for developing Kan sight: "It is
        important to observe both sides without moving the eyes. It is
        no good trying to learn this kind of thing in great haste.
        Always be watchful in this manner and under no circumstances
        alter your point of concentration." </p>
      <p>While Musashi certainly didn't understand the physiology of
        sight, he was acutely aware of the difference between cone and
        rod vision. We reviewed the science of vision and read that the
        retina of the human eye is composed of three distinct areas: the
        fovea, macula and peripheral region. Each area performs a
        distinctive visual function and contributes to the sense we call
        sight. Because these different functions operate simultaneously
        and blend into each other, they aren't normally differentiated.
      </p>
      <p>The fovea is a small circular pit in the center of the retina
        packed with an unbelievable concentration (160,000 cells per
        square millimeter, an area about the size of the head of a pin)
        of color- sensitive receptor cells called cones, each with its
        own nerve fiber. The fovea enables the average person to see
        most sharply within a circle less than an eighth of an inch in
        diameter at a distance of twelve inches from the eye. </p>
      <p>Surrounding the fovea is the macula, an oval body of
        color-sensitive cells. Macular vision is quite clear, but not as
        clear and sharp as foveal vision, because the cones aren't as
        closely packed as they are in the fovea. We use the macula for
        reading or watching television, among other things. </p>
      <p>Moving away from the central portion of the retina, the
        character and quality of vision changes radically. The capacity
        to see color diminishes as the color-sensitive cones become more
        scattered. Fine vision associated with closely packed cones,
        each with its own neuron, shifts to a coarser vision in which
        two hundred or more of a different type of receptor cell - the
        rods - are each connected to a single neuron. The effect of the
        connections between rods is to amplify the perception of motion
        and light while reducing the capacity for distinguishing detail.
      </p>
      <p>For our purposes, we began to think of the retina as divided
        into two areas: the fovea and macula, both with high
        concentrations of cones, and the periphery, where rods
        predominate - in short, cone and rod vision, responsible
        respectively for focused and peripheral vision. </p>
      <p>A quick way of understanding the extent of these two regions of
        sight is to extend your fists directly in front, side by side.
        Your fists cover the approximate area normally seen by cones;
        the rest of your visual field is largely rod mediated. Thus it's
        apparent that only a small percentage of our total visual field
        is clearly focused. Attending only to this region results in
        what is commonly called tunnel vision - figuratively and
        literally, as we've come to believe. </p>
      <p>It became evident to us that many of the special perceptions we
        sought came from the ability to observe the world and ourselves
        from a "different point of view," in a broader, unfettered
        context. </p>
      <p>In time the obvious struck us, that the experience of insight,
        rapid learning, invention, creativity, intuition, and perhaps
        even personal change have a direct connection with second sight,
        a sight dependent almost completely on the brain's capacity for
        processing peripheral vision. </p>
      <p>We decided to try to develop a technique which would
        effectively stimulate this special way of seeing. After some
        trial and error we originated an exercise and designed a simple
        piece of equipment which seemed to enhance our access to second
        sight. </p>
      <p>On the bill of a baseball cap we mounted a metal rod welded to
        a binder clip, extending about a foot in front of our eyes. On
        the tip of this rod we glued a small bead of plastic resin about
        the size of a baby green pea. This created a fixed point on
        which to focus. We reasoned that with our focused vision on the
        bead, any physical activity would necessitate the use of
        peripheral vision. </p>
      <p>We chose hiking. </p>
      <p>We drove out into the countryside near our homes in northern
        New Mexico, found a place where we wouldn't be interrupted,
        donned our caps and set out. In the beginning, disoriented and
        functionally blind, we made our way cautiously along an old jeep
        trail. Soon we noticed that our feet seemed to know what to do.
        We stepped over and around obstacles on the ground without
        consciously being able to see them. It became apparent that our
        non-conscious minds could see the ground directly in front of us
        perfectly well. </p>
      <p>Within an hour our field of vision began to clear, and we both
        became engrossed with the phenomenon of seeing double. Walking
        behind, one could watch two identical people moving up ahead,
        walking side by side, each making identical movements. A sort of
        Zen paradox arose as to which was the real one. We later
        understood that the solution to this and other "reality"
        paradoxes was an important part of learning to use and trust
        second sight. </p>
      <p>As we walked we began to notice that other senses such as
        hearing, balance and touch naturally expanded and became more
        acute, as if we'd gradually become conscious of the peripheral
        regions of these senses too. Concurrently, the perception of
        "weight" shifted lower in our bodies, to the hips and on down to
        our feet. </p>
      <p>After a couple of hours of walking along the road we began to
        experience a deep sense of relaxation. We noticed our hands had
        warmed considerably, an indication that stimulation of the
        parasympathetic nervous system was somehow related to the
        experience of second sight. </p>
      <p>Each time we have walked (probably a hundred times by now), a
        sense of deep calm has been experienced. It took a while to
        understand what was going on, but our theory is this: Walking
        while relying only on second sight requires that the conscious
        mind trust the non- conscious, and this inter-mind trust is the
        essence of relaxation itself. </p>
      <p>On the next few outings we picked steeper grades and rougher
        terrain. We found we could easily control fatigue and pain by
        using an application of will - focusing attention on the tired
        body part, for instance, and moving the discomfort off to the
        edges of awareness, virtually the same process as moving our
        attention about in the great field of peripheral vision without
        moving our eyes. </p>
      <p>In our reading we had been reminded that in darkness,
        peripheral (rod) vision is far superior to focused (cone)
        vision. Night vision relies almost entirely on rods, which
        because of their neural connections and physical makeup are very
        sensitive to light. Rods need about thirty minutes of dark or
        dim red light to activate fully, and then, it is claimed, they
        have the capacity to detect a single photon - the equivalent, in
        clear air, of detecting the flame of a candle that is ten miles
        away. </p>
      <p>In the dark, cones are for the most part visually useless, and
        so we figured that walking in the dark would force us to become
        even more dependent on peripheral vision. It was time to up the
        ante. </p>
      <p>We modified the headgear by painting the beads with luminescent
        paint and increased our daily intake of Vitamin A (necessary for
        the formation of visual purple, a substance which enables the
        eyes to adjust from bright light to darkness) to 50,000 IU for a
        week to make sure we weren't deficient. </p>
      <p>We picked an area where we hadn't walked before and started out
        around sunset. For the first hour of walking we noticed all the
        familiar inner shifts and sensations. And then something strange
        happened: we entered the night. </p>
      <p>We really don't have better description. When it became
        apparent that we could see perfectly well, the night became
        alive. </p>
      <p>Rabbits hopped by, nighthawks and bats flew past to check us
        out. Our steps got lighter, walking was approaching the status
        of flight. We felt like we'd fully entered the experience of
        second sight. </p>
      <p>Other senses expanded even more than we'd experienced before.
        Balance became much more sensitive. Later we developed a very
        slow- waking kind of Tai Chi just to enjoy this exquisite sense
        of balance. Our skin started to feel peculiar, more "solid"
        perhaps, and we found we could walk comfortably in quite chilly
        air without any clothes. </p>
      <p>Probably due to our increased ability to concentrate and the
        air qualities of night, hearing and smell were vastly improved.
        As we became proficient at seeing in the dark, we found that we
        could run down arroyos and climb steep banks in the dead of
        night, all the while focusing on the luminescent beads. With the
        calm of Nightwalking, we discovered that anxiety and fear of the
        dark, so common in our culture, are effectively eliminated. </p>
      <p>Fear, anxiety and even physical pain are seemingly associated
        with focused vision, while peripheral processes engender
        relaxation and delight, a state we have half-seriously dubbed
        Sense-Surround. </p>
      <p>A friend heard what we were doing and tipped us off to
        Alexandra David-Neel, who for some years studied and toured in
        Tibet. </p>
      <p>In <span style="font-style: italic;">Magic and Mystery in
          Tibet</span>, she describes her encounter with and
        investigation of Lung-gom-pas, Tibetan spiritual walkers of
        extraordinary ability. According to David-Neel, "The walker must
        neither speak, nor look from side to side. He must keep his eyes
        fixed on a single object and never allow this attention to be
        attracted by anything else. </p>
      <p>When the trance state has been reached, though normal
        consciousness is for the greater part suppressed, it remains
        sufficiently alive to keep the walker aware of the obstacles in
        his way and mindful of his direction and goal." We felt in good
        company. </p>
      <p>Nightwalking became one of the most consistently relaxing and
        exhilarating experiences either of us had ever had. The reports,
        ancient and modern, turned out to be true - employing second
        sight did facilitate a distinct change in perciption and sense
        of wellbeing. </p>
      <p>Not only were we learning to travel freely in the dark; it was
        becoming apparent that this capability connected us more
        directly to the non-conscious. Far from being a storehouse of
        fear, we found it an incredible protector, dedicated to our
        safety and happiness. </p>
      <p>Just to make sure we weren't doing something that might cause
        undue eye strain, we thought it might be wise to take an
        optometrist on a Nightwalk. We contacted a respected Santa Fe
        practitioner who initially sounded skeptical but agreed to join
        us. </p>
      <p>Not only did he give us a clean bill of health, but by the end
        of his first walk he was speculating about the possible value of
        Nightwalking in treating myopia. </p>
      <p>We began wondering whether Nightwalking would prove as exciting
        and useful for others as it did for us. So we planned a training
        which was divided into four sessions of about three hours each,
        covering various terrains and their attendant challenges. </p>
      <p>The first group of a dozen trainees assembled shortly after
        sundown in the dry stream bed of the Rio de oa Truchas, on
        Bureau of Land Management land between Santa Fe and Taos. Hats
        and rods were passed out along with simple instructions: Watch
        the rod tip and keep it up near the horizon, walk slowly and
        start to notice the scenery to the sides as you pass by. With a
        sense of mystery and excitement this first group set out,
        walking single-file into the twilight. </p>
      <p>Musashi had given instructions for a particular kind of stance
        to practice while using second sight. We had fiddled with it
        early on but found that the stance came naturally while engaging
        in second sight. </p>
      <p>We wondered if people would automatically adopt this stance as
        they became more proficient at Nightwalking. They did, and we
        found we could tell if a particular person was using second
        sight just by watching their walk. </p>
      <p>After the third session everyone could run over the rocks and
        gravel in dry stream beds in the dark using only second sight.
        By the fourth session members of the group could take the lead
        and find their way unerringly on the darkest of dark nights. </p>
      <p>After twelve hours of practice, virtually every one in the
        group could enter second sight at will, which had taken us about
        a year to figure out and master. </p>
      <p>After the training we queried participants about the lasting
        effects of the experience. Most of them reported shifts in their
        worldly perception and daily lives. Several commented on their
        increased ability to quiet "brain chatter." Virtually all
        walkers said their awareness of the world around them was
        broadened, and they were less "stuck" in their heads. </p>
      <p>As someone in a later group aptly pointed put: "This is really
        about convergence. It's about taking a whole bunch of things
        that are semi-clear and converging them into a single
        crystalline vision." </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>TIPS ON NIGHTWALKING</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>For people living outdoors, peripheral vision is critical for
        staying alive. It may be time to rediscover it. Here are a few
        tips. Fix yourself a modified cap and adjust it so the rod tip
        is directly in line with your nose at eye level. Focus on the
        tip as you walk around your house. Then try walking around the
        yard. </p>
      <p>Avoid places where there may be traffic or drop-offs. In the
        beginning your vision will seem blurred. Pay attention to the
        total field of vision, far to the sides and up and down. Slowly
        you'll be able to perceive a fairly clear field of vision with
        only the center (cone vision) blurred, doubled in fact. As your
        field of vision begins to clear take it as an indication that
        you're switching over to second sight. </p>
      <p>Later you can begin to examine elements in your field of vision
        by simply moving your attention to them. Notice that we say
        attention, not eyes. Your eyes should remain constantly on the
        tip of the rod. </p>
      <p>This is really what second sight is about, using just
        peripheral vision and the mind to gather and process visual
        information. The first part will take about three hours, the
        second about the same length of time. </p>
      <p>By keeping your eyes focused on the rod tip while walking, you
        will eventually break two strong visual habits - relying only on
        cone vision and moving the eyes to new points of interest. Find
        a place to walk in the dark which is out of the range of
        artificial lights. </p>
      <p>Pick a night with little or no moon; take a friend. </p>
      <p>Because of the rods' extreme sensitivity to light, you may see
        unusual light phenomena. Some of this is imaginary, caused by
        "overcharging" of unused optic nerves, the rest results from
        natural or bioluminescence. </p>
      <p>Over time Nightwalking sensitizes the eye and brain, so some of
        what you see may surprise you. We've become aware of
        light-emitting bacteria in rotting logs and along the veins of
        certain plants. Fireflies seem like strobe lights. Glow worms
        are blinding. A quarter moon rising on a clear night can bring
        tears to your eyes with its brightness. </p>
