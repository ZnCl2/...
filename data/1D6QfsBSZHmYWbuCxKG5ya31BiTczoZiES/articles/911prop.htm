    <blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the immediate
        aftermath
        of the destruction of the World Trade Center, the finger of
        guilt was directed
        toward the only plausible author for such a sophisticated and
        ruthless
        act of terror - Osama bin Laden.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In bits and pieces
          throughout the
          late '90's - punctuated by various acts of terror perpetrated
          against overseas
          American interests - we were informed that bin Laden had
          declared war on
          America by reason of the American military presence on Saudi
          soil in the
          wake of the Persian Gulf War. We were told how bin Laden,
          ensconced in
          Afghanistan, headed up a world-wide terror franchise whose
          sophistication
          and global reach dwarfed that of the Iranian-financed
          Hizballah or Islamic
          Jihad (previously, the most widely known of the terror
          organizations among
          the masses in the Middle East). From the beginning, this
          terror entity,
          al-Qaida, was presented to us as something entirely new in the
          annals of
          terrorism - a far-flung, sophisticated empire of terror,
          possessing - possibly
          - weapons of mass destruction, while having no clear or viable
          state sponsor
          behind it (as the Afghani Taliban were merely its resident
          protectors).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More disturbingly, Americans
          were
          presented with an apocalyptic nemesis whose animosities could
          not be curbed
          by any rational political considerations or alignments. In
          short, by September
          11, the United States now had a bona fide enemy - and, as they
          say in criminal
          justice parlance, a suspect with motive, means, and
          opportunity.</font>
      </p>
      <h4>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">John O'Neill</font></h4>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times">And while I was a bit taken at
        how quickly
        - and confidently - the fingers were pointing only hours after
        the 9/11
        bombings, I was positively shaken by the first red flag that
        popped up.
        His name was John O'Neill - or more precisely, he is the seam
        that shows.
        Dated September 12, in a Washington Post article by Vernon Loeb,
        it was
        revealed that O'Neill, who died in his capacity as head of
        security for
        the World Trade Center, was also formerly the New York FBI
        Counterterror
        chief responsible for the investigation into Osama bin Laden.
        That could
        perhaps be written off as one of those freak synchronicities. It
        was the
        other items - reported quite blandly, in that "there's nothing
        to see here,
        folks" tone - that gave me that sinking feeling. Apparently,
        O'Neill had
        a falling-out with the Ambassador to Yemen over his
        investigative style
        and was banned from returning there. But then there was that
        other nugget
        that I had trouble digesting - that O'Neill had resigned from a
        thirty-year
        career in the FBI "under a cloud" over an incident in Tampa -
        and then
        left to take up the security position at the WTC (only two weeks
        before!).</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The seam that shows...</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the bulk of his career,
          like
          most of his FBI colleagues, John O'Neill was largely unknown
          to the public
          at large - respected in his circle, to be sure, yet scarcely
          meriting much
          mention in the media - beyond being referenced now and then as
          an expert
          on counterterrorism. Yet in the few months leading up to
          September 11,
          O'Neill was now suddenly the subject of a series of seemingly
          unrelated
          controversies - the first, in July, involving his dispute with
          the State
          Department over the conduct of the bin Laden investigation in
          Yemen; and
          the second, in August, in which he was reported to be under an
          FBI probe
          for misplacing a briefcase of classified documents during an
          FBI convention
          in Tampa.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the light of the
          aftermath of
          this second controversy - the documents were found,
          "untouched", a few
          hours later - one wonders why this seemingly minor news would
          merit such
          lengthy coverage in the Washington Post and New York Times.
          Keeping in
          mind the fact that these latter articles on O'Neill appeared a
          mere three
          weeks before he was to die in the rubble of the Twin Towers,
          one wonders
          if this wasn't a well-orchestrated smear campaign against
          O'Neill, with
          a bit of unintended "blowback" - as this now-discredited
          counterterror
          chief in charge of all bin Laden bombings would finally make
          the news as
          a fatal casualty of bin Laden's final bombing. Coincidence? Or
          was there
          something more here that would bear investigating?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My gut told me that, in the
          months
          preceding September 11, somebody was out to discredit John
          O'Neill, yet
          this public campaign would come back to haunt the planners in
          the light
          of John O'Neill's ultimate demise. Was a mistake made - one
          pointing the
          way toward a plan whose scope goes well beyond the designs of
          Osama bin
          Laden? In other words, could we spot the telltale fingerprints
          of a domestic
          conspiracy?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Well, as they say, a
          hypothesis is
          only as good as its usefulness in ferreting out reality. My
          hypothesis:
          that the events of September 11 were planned by those who not
          only had
          the motive, means, and opportunity to carry out the plan, but
          also were
          best placed to manage the consequences stemming from it, as
          well as managing
          the flow of information. If this were an "inside job", the
          first thing
          to do was to look at who conveyed specific information on bin
          Laden before
          - and I stress, before - 9/11, for they were most likely
          involved wittingly
          or not with those who masterminded it. In other words,
          circumstantial evidence
          of a propaganda campaign, pre-9/11, to present Osama bin Laden
          as America's
          foremost nemesis would also provide the circumstantial case
          against the
          propaganda planners in taking down the World Trade Towers. So
          I monitored
          CNN and other media in the days immediately after, taking note
          of those
          trotted out - Judith Miller, Paul Bremer, James Risen, Vincent
          Cannistraro,
          etc. - to provide instant commentary on bin Laden. Moreover, I
          trolled
          through past articles on bin Laden - noting the wire service
          uniformity
          of information as well as sources.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But first there was the John
          O'Neill
          conundrum. If my hypothesis were correct, it wouldn't make
          much sense to
          draw public attention on September 12 - however blandly stated
          - to the
          fact that O'Neill had left the FBI "under a cloud" and that he
          had been
          banned from the bin Laden investigation in Yemen. It was a
          September 4
          article in the Washington Post by Vernon Loeb that gave me my
          answer. That
          article, involving the Yemen investigation, mentioned briefly
          about O'Neill
          being banned by the Ambassador as well as O'Neill's travails
          with the briefcase
          incident. This was a full week before the WTC attack. It was
          perhaps conceivable
          that, upon hearing of O'Neill's demise, someone would dig up
          the September
          4 item and smell a rat. Thus, the September 12 follow-up with
          its "nothing
          shady here" tone - employing, virtually word-for-word, the
          incriminating
          information revealed on September 4, but providing no more
          details than
          that. An almost obligatory coda to paper over a thoughtless
          oversight.
          Presumably, Loeb - the national security correspondent for the
          Post - had
          no inkling of what was to come in the week ahead, so the
          oversight can
          most probably be laid at the feet of his confidential source.
          In any case,
          the credulous tone of that follow-up reportage succeeded in
          the psychological
          trick of "normalizing" an apparent anomaly - a standard
          propaganda trick
          known as a "limited hang-out."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There's more. The evidence
          implicating
          bin Laden was now pouring in. Virtually the first "smoking
          gun" was presented
          the day after 9/11, when Vernon Loeb and Dan Eggen reported in
          the Post
          that Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the Al-Quds al Arabi
          newspaper in London,
          "received information that he [bin Laden] planned very, very
          big attacks
          against American interests" only three weeks before 9/11.
          Moreover, the
          article reported that Atwan "was convinced that Islamic
          fundamentalists
          aligned with bin Laden were 'almost certainly' behind the
          attacks." Incidentally,
          Atwan had personally interviewed bin Laden in Afghanistan in
          1996 - among
          the very few to do so. As reported by Michael Evans in the
          August 24, 1998
          issue of The Times, Atwan "is trusted by bin Laden."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Curious, perhaps, that Atwan
          seemed
          to be one of the major "point men" used in elaborating the
          Osama bin Laden
          "legend", as they say in intelligence parlance. In a U.S. News
          article
          dated August 31, 1998, Atwan informs us that bin Laden "is a
          humble man
          who lives simply, eating fried eggs, tasteless low-fat cheese,
          and bread
          gritty with sand. He hates America." No flash in the pan, this
          interviewer.
          Apparently, bin Laden kept Atwan's business card tucked away
          in his toga
          pocket. "Bin Laden phoned this newspaper, phoned me last
          Friday," Atwan
          revealed in an ABC News LateLine Transcript dated August 25,
          1998. We'll
          come back to ABC News shortly.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While solidly implicating
          bin Laden
          the day after 9/11, Atwan was also the media's "go-to" guy
          back in 1998
          when he informed us, after President Clinton bombed tool sheds
          in Afghanistan,
          that bin Laden issued this threat against the United States:
          "The battle
          has not started yet. The response will be with action and not
          words." In
          the same article (which I took from Nando Times), ABC News is
          the source
          for an additional threat called in by Ayman al-Zawahiri, a
          senior bin Laden
          aide: "The war has just started. The Americans should wait for
          the answer."
          Only a few months before that, ABC had conducted its televised
          interview
          of bin Laden. By the summer of 1998, primed by Atwan, ABC
          NEWS, and a surprisingly
          small clique of well-worn sources, we had come to know bin
          Laden as America's
          latest "Saddam", "Qaddafi", "Noriega" - take your pick and set
          your bomb
          sites. To be fair to ABC NEWS, they did include the comments
          of the Honourary
          Consul of Afghanistan in the above-noted 1998 LateLine
          transcript: "There
          is a pattern developing - I'm not quite sure about the rest of
          the world,
          but in Afghanistan that has been the case for the past 20
          years. That the
          intelligence service they put together they create somebody
          [sic], and
          they turn them into a monster and then they attack this very
          same creation,
          they destroy that creation and then they reinvent another
          creation."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By October 2000, when the
          U.S.S.
          Cole was bombed in Yemen, in case there was any doubt, Atwan
          offered Reuters
          his helpful analysis with regards to the source of blame: "I
          do not rule
          out that this was undertaken by Osama bin Laden. Yemeni groups
          don't have
          the experience to carry out this kind of operation." Still, to
          assure us
          that a bin Laden connection to the Yemen incident was at least
          plausible,
          Atwan recalled, in the same interview with Reuters, how, "in
          the early
          1990's [bin Laden] had hoped U.S. soldiers would stop off in
          Aden during
          their peacekeeping deployment in Somalia, exposing themselves
          to attack
          from his Yemen-based followers." Also, Atwan informed Reuters
          that bin
          Laden "was unlikely to claim direct responsibility for
          Thursday's attack
          for fear of U.S. reprisals." One can imagine, then, that Atwan
          gave his
          trusting phone mate cause for many a sleepless night. With
          friends like
          these...</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Leading up to 9/11, by the
          Spring
          of 2001, an incriminating wedding videotape, apparently
          implicating bin
          Laden in the Yemen bombing, was circulating around the Middle
          East after
          being broadcast on the ubiquitous al-Jazeera television
          station (reconstituted
          from the BBC TV Arabic Service - more on them later). In the
          video, bin
          Laden, according to the Saudi-owned al-Hayat newspaper (more
          on them later,
          too), recited a poem celebrating the bombing of the U.S.S.
          Cole (shades
          of deja vu here?) This from the ABCNEWS.com site dated March
          1: "Al-Hayat,
          which carried a photo of bin Laden and his son at the wedding,
          said its
          correspondent was the only journalist at the ceremony, also
          attended by
          bin Laden's mother, two brothers and sister who flew to
          Kandahar from Saudi
          Arabia." Last I heard, the official story was that bin Laden
          was on the
          outs with his family. Well, maybe they just don't invite him
          to the seders
          anymore.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And yes, here, too, Atwan
          offers
          his thoughtful review of the bin Laden video, courtesy of PTI,
          datelined
          London June 22, 2001: "[Atwan] said the video was proof that
          the fugitive
          Saudi millionaire [the Bruce Wayne of terrorists] was fit,
          well equipped
          and confident enough to send out a call to arms." Why this
          sudden need
          for proof? According to Atwan in the same article: "There have
          been rumours
          that he is ill and that he is being contained by the Taliban
          in Afghanistan.
          It is quite clear from the film that he is in good health to
          the point
          where he can fire a rifle, and is free to operate as he
          chooses." In other
          words, limber enough for his starring role in the months
          ahead.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So who is Abdel Bari Atwan
          and why
          is he anxious to tell us so much? According to the Winter 1999
          issue of
          INEAS (Institute of Near Eastern and African Studies), Abdel
          Bari Atwan,
          a Palestinian, was born in a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip in
          1950. Educated
          at the American University of Cairo, Atwan moved to Saudi
          Arabia and worked
          as a writer for the al-Madina newspaper. In 1978, he moved to
          London, where
          he became a correspondent for the Saudi-owned Asharq Al-Awsat
          newspaper.
          In 1988, after shuffling around between Saudi-owned papers,
          Atwan was offered
          a position as editor of al-Quds al-Arabi. By his account, he
          was offered
          a position as the executive editor of the Saudi-owned al-Hayat
          (of the
          bin Laden wedding video coup), yet turned it down to produce a
          more independent
          newspaper as a challenge to the "empires" of the
          Saudi-dominated dailies.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Al-Quds began production in
          April
          1989. A little more than a year later, Saddam invaded Kuwait
          and al-Quds
          stood alone as the only Arab newspaper opposed to the Persian
          Gulf War
          - at least by Atwan's account. According to Atwan: "Without
          the Gulf War,
          we wouldn't have taken such political lines, which made us
          well recognized
          and well respected." In November 1996, Bari-Atwan braved a
          twelve-hour
          car ride through muddy roads, attired in shabby Afghani rags
          in below-zero
          weather, and gave us the early scoop on bin Laden, conducting
          a one-on-one
          interview in bin Laden's [bat]cave. From then on, the
          mainstream media
          - CNN, ABC, BBC, Sky News - looked to Bari-Atwan and al-Quds
          as the "independent"
          voice of the Arab street.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Incidentally, in a
          discussion concerning
          the matter of Saudi domination of the Arabic media, taken from
          the Carryon.oneworld.org
          site, Atwan, as editor of his struggling independent, was
          facing off against
          Jihad Khazen, the editor of the Saudi-owned al-Hayat. As Atwan
          proudly
          related in support of his independence: "One day I was called
          by the BBC-TV
          Arabic service [whose staff later reconstituted itself as
          al-Jazeera television]:
          'There's a story on your front page today, saying such and
          such. Is it
          true?' I asked why he should doubt it and he replied: 'It's
          not published
          in al-Hayat [his job offer] or al-Sharq al-Awsat [his alma
          mater].' " Atwan
          boasts: "At least I can say we are 95 to 96 per cent
          independent" - leaving
          out the 4 to 5 per cent spent on bin Laden, I presume. Whether
          or not al-Quds
          truly is independent, this is the cover story the mainstream
          media buys
          into when they come trolling for their "independent" evidence.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, to elaborate further on
          this
          (so far) fruitful hypothesis, it is my contention that
          al-Qaida and bin
          Laden are elaborate "legends" set up to promote a plausibly
          sophisticated
          and ferocious enemy to stand against American interests. I am
          not, however,
          implying that bin Laden himself is a total fabrication.
          Rather, it is my
          contention that confederates, believing themselves to act on
          behalf of
          bin Laden, are being set up in a "false flag operation" to
          perform operations
          as their controllers see fit. And who are these controllers?
          If they're
          anything resembling the folks who brought you Hizbullah and
          Hamas, you
          wouldn't be sweating the suitcase nukes (made in America), the
          Ames strain
          anthrax (made in America), the MI5-like "sleeper agents" and
          coded "go"
          messages. Instead, you would be dodging primitive nail bombs
          and road mines
          - and not needing Abdel Bari Atwan to feed you the lowdown on
          the blame.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In view of the fact that bin
          Laden
          is of Saudi origin, that much of the "evidence" on the Arab
          side initially
          originated from Saudi-owned or Gulf Anglo-client state
          sources, and that
          Saudi Arabia is the major financial sponsor of the Taliban
          brand of fundamentalism
          in Afghanistan (as a counter-point to Iran), I believe it is
          fair to say
          that Saudi Arabia might possibly be implicated. But why only
          take my word
          for it? Just reference French security expert Jean-Charles
          Brisard, who
          in his book quoted John O'Neill as saying, "All the answers,
          everything
          needed to dismantle Osama bin Laden's organization can be
          found in Saudi
          Arabia ." Most likely, the Saudis performed their roles as
          subservient
          proxies. We'll get to the ultimate controllers soon enough (if
          you haven't
          already guessed where this is going). And now, to fill out the
          picture
          further, it is necessary to name an equally essential partner
          as proxy
          - Pakistan, or, more specifically, Pakistan's version of the
          CIA - the
          ISI (Interservices Intelligence Directorate).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And this is where we begin
          to "close
          the circle" of our closed-knit pre-9/11 propaganda clique.
          Returning again
          to the above-mentioned Dan Eggen and Vernon Loeb Post article
          of September
          12, we're offered - in a powerful little side-bar - more
          critical evidence
          implicating bin Laden for the attacks the day before. This
          time, the bombshell
          is offered by Palestinian journalist Jamal Ismail, Abu Dhabi
          Television's
          bureau chief in Islamabad. According to Ismail, a bin Laden
          aide called
          him "early Wednesday on a satellite telephone from a hide-out
          in Afghanistan,"
          praising the attack yet denying any responsibility for it. By
          now thoroughly
          cynical and looking askance at anyone providing incriminating
          "evidence"
          so soon in the day, I decided to have a look at any
          interesting synchronicities
          I might find involving Ismail. As it turns out, Ismail was
          also among the
          select few to conduct his very own bin Laden interview,
          published by Newsweek
          (owned by the Washington Post) in its April 1, 1999 issue.
          Here is how
          Newsweek described Ismail's good fortune: "Palestinian
          journalist Jamal
          Ismail's mobile phone rang just before prayers on December 18.
          'Peace be
          upon you, ' said the voice on the line. 'You may not recognize
          me, but
          I know you.' " And thus was Jamal Ismail invited on his own
          mud-soaked
          incursion to the bin Laden [bat]cave.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Searching deeper, I found an
          interesting
          obscure article penned by respected Pakistani journalist
          Rahimullah Yusufszai
          in The News Jang, and dated May 3 2000. It details the
          detention of two
          men of Kurdish origin, accused by the Taliban of spying for
          American and
          Israeli intelligence. As Yusufszai relates it, he spoke to the
          only journalists
          allowed by the Taliban to interview the detained men - Jamal
          Ismail and
          his cameraman. Apparently, Ismail had a special relationship
          with the Taliban,
          allowing him this rare privilege above other journalists. And,
          as we shall
          shortly see, so does Yusufszai. One wonders who debriefs them
          at the end
          of a workday. But more interestingly, by May 5, as reported by
          Kathy Gannon
          for the Associated Press, the story acquires - as they say -
          "new legs."
          Not only are the basic elements of the Yusufszai story
          mentioned, but the
          article leads off with the bombshell that one of the detained
          men revealed
          that he was recruited by the United States to find Osama bin
          Laden. It
          finishes with a little coda implicating bin Laden in the 1998
          embassy bombings.
          Thus, in the space of two days, Yusufszai's Pakistani "spy"
          article sprouts
          a bin Laden addition when fertilized by the American
          Associated Press -
          and nicely provides a plausible explanation as to why a Kurd
          would be prowling
          around Afghanistan on behalf of the United States.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yusufszai, incidentally,
          moonlighted
          as an ABC News producer, charged with guiding ABC News
          correspondent John
          Miller through the Afghani marshes to the bin Laden [bat]cave
          - the only
          American journalist to be accorded such an honour (and also,
          as it happens,
          a good friend of bin Laden arch-foe John O'Neill. But not
          chummy enough
          to direct O'Neill on to bin Laden's hideaway). Moreover,
          Ismail and Yusufszai
          are mentioned together in a CNN article posted January 4, 1999
          - the former
          for his Newsweek interview, the latter for his own bin Laden
          dialogue for
          TIME Magazine the day later.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rahimullah Yusufszai,
          regarded by
          New York Times reporters John Burns and Steve LeVine as "one
          man who has
          seen more of the Taliban than any other outsider," is also
          named by The
          Nation, in its article of January 27, 1997, as "one of the
          favourite journalists
          of [Pakistan's] ISI...one of the organizations funding and
          arming the Taliban.
          "</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It's a small world after
          all. In
          the September 29, 2001 article of PressPlus, Yusufszai's ABC
          colleague,
          John Miller, mused about running into his buddy John O'Neill
          in Yemen while
          reporting on the U.S.S. Cole bombing the year before. "He
          said, 'So this
          is the Elaine's of Yemen.' "</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"There is a terrible irony
          to all
          this," Miller said. I'll say: Miller, the only American who
          can give a
          first-hand account of bin Laden, bumps into his friend, bin
          Laden's chief
          investigator while both are investigating a bombing in Yemen
          that will
          later be tagged onto bin Laden - and only a year before
          O'Neill dies at
          the hands of... allegedly ...bin Laden.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, following the logic of
          my hypothesis,
          if the bin Laden threat was, pre-9/11, a closed-knit
          propaganda campaign,
          one would expect to find the same names showing up repeatedly
          in combination
          with one another. This, too, applies to the American
          commentators. Let
          us return to the August 1998 American bombings of bin Laden's
          tool sheds
          as an example. The night of the bombing, Rahimullah Yusufszai
          received
          a call from bin Laden aide Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a report from
          the Associated
          Press. Later, Yusufszai obtained for ABC News exclusive photos
          of the damage
          to bin Laden's camp. Further commentary describing the layout
          of the bin
          Laden camp was furnished to the Washington Post by former CIA
          analyst and
          terrorism expert Kenneth Katzman, as well as Harvey Kushner of
          Long Island
          University. Only little more than a week before that, Katzman
          and Kushner
          were offering their assessment of bin Laden's culpability for
          the embassy
          bombings in Africa in a Washington Post article penned by
          Vernon Loeb and
          Walter Pincus (who once admitted to a prior CIA connection).
          They were
          joined in this effort by Vincent Cannistraro, the ABC news
          analyst who
          provided running commentary in the days immediately following
          9/11. Cannistraro,
          a former CIA counterterrorism chief, provided covert aid to
          the Afghani
          mujaheddin in the late '80's, as well as supervised CIA
          operations with
          the contras. He was also one of the point men in the
          notoriously circumspect
          investigation at Lockerbie. In the above-noted Loeb and Pincus
          article
          - in which bin Laden is quoted from the ABC News Miller and
          Yusufszai interview
          - Cannistraro weighs in with his assessment of the embassy
          bombings: "I
          believe Osama bin Laden is the sponsor of this operation, and
          I think all
          of the indications are pointing that way."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Soon after the bombing of
          the U.S.S.
          Cole in Yemen, a Vernon Loeb Post article, dated October 13,
          2000, proceeded
          to implicate bin Laden through the detailed information
          provided by Kushner,
          Katzman, and Cannistraro. Kushner: "He [bin Laden] has been
          looking around
          for small, personal submarines. One of his relatives in the
          United States
          had an order in for one of these personal submarines, and it
          was stopped."
          Katzman: "He [bin</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Laden] has claimed
          responsibility
          for bombing a hotel in Yemen in 1992 where U.S. servicemen
          stayed on their
          way to Somalia." Was that so? This, of course, was a variation
          on the disclosure
          that Atwan provided that very same day to Reuters, to whom he
          quoted bin
          Laden as saying, "We waited for them [the servicemen] in Aden
          but they
          left the region. They knew what we wanted to do to them. "
          Thus we have
          two conflicting versions that very same day - Katzman's Post
          version and
          Atwan's Reuters version - offered as evidence of bin Laden's
          culpability
          for the U.S.S. Cole bombings. To this day, it is not clear
          which one has
          been accepted into the official canon of the bin Laden
          "legend." Clearly,
          someone wasn't coordinating the information flow too well that
          day.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Nevertheless, the bin Laden
          "legend"
          was continuing to be elaborated, with helpful revelations
          provided by the
          same cast of characters. In the Vernon Loeb Post article dated
          July 3,
          2000, Yusufszai, Kushner, and Cannistraro unveil bin Laden
          aides Ayman
          al-Zawahiri and Muhammed Atef as the men to watch as bin
          Laden's likely
          successors, with a helpful tidbit on the Zawahiri biography
          thrown in by
          the Saudi-owned al-Sharq al-Awsat.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">None of the above, of
          course, is
          offered as the "smoking gun" pointing the way to a propaganda
          conspiracy,
          nor are my chosen examples meant to be exhaustive in
          evidencing this point.
          Clearly, I have not heretofore made mention of the other
          experts who have
          worked assiduously toward building our knowledge base on bin
          Laden - Steven
          Emerson, Daniel Pipes, Yosef Bodansky, Judith Miller, and
          various British
          and EU elites. However, the above examples do show how the
          information
          flow on bin Laden could be plausibly managed by the skilfully
          placed revelations
          of a relatively insular clique of "experts" called upon
          repeatedly by the
          mainstream media. Such a technique of covert media
          manipulation was, in
          fact, revealed as an institutional norm with the exposure of
          the CIA's
          Project Mockingbird in the '70's. Officially, it was
          discontinued. Nevertheless,
          the essential infrastructure remains intact. A relatively few
          well-connected
          correspondents provide the "scoops" that get the coverage in
          the relatively
          few mainstream news sources - the four TV networks, TIME,
          Newsweek, CNN
          - where the parameters of debate are set and the "official
          reality" is
          consecrated for the bottom feeders in the news chain. In other
          countries,
          this is what is known as propaganda - or, put less politely,
          psychological
          warfare. A key element in the uses of psychological warfare is
          the repeated
          traumatization and sheer numbing of a populace in order to
          achieve the
          desired strategic goals.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But before I leave this
          topic, I
          would like to provide an example of "news management" that is

          for what is omitted - that is, the "smoking gun" of Pakistani
          ISI involvement
          in the events of 9/11. This from Karachi News, September 9,

            Last time Ziauddin
            Butt, Mahmood's predecessor, was here during Nawaz Sharif's
            government
            the domestic politics turned topsy-turvy within days. That
            this is not
            the first visit by Mahmood in the last three months shows
            the urgency of
            the ongoing parleys...Interestingly, his visit also saw two
            CIA reports
            expressing concern on issues related to Pakistan this week.
            One of them
            was about the effects of demographic explosion and
            Pakistan's continued
            build up in its nuclear and missiles programme."</font></i></blockquote>
      <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, let us move ahead three
        weeks later,
        to a transcript of ABC's "This Week", posted on the Washington
        Post website
        September 30, 2001: "As to September 11, federal authorities
        have told
        ABC News they've now tracked more than $100,000 from banks in
        Pakistan
        to two banks in Florida to accounts held by suspected hijack
        ringleader
        Mohamed Atta. As well this morning, TIME magazine is reporting
        that some
        of that money came in the days just before the attack and can be
        traced
        directly to people connected to Osama bin Laden."</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, a little more than a
          week later,
          on October 9, 2001, as reported by The Times of India: "While
          the Pakistani
          Inter Services Public Relations claimed that former ISI
          director-general
          Lt-Gen Mahmud Ahmad sought retirement after being superseded
          on Monday,
          the truth is more shocking. Top sources confirmed here on
          Tuesday that
          the general lost his job because of the "evidence" India
          produced to show
          his links to one of the suicide bombers that wrecked the World
          Trade Centre.
          The US authorities sought his removal after confirming the
          fact that $100,000
          were wired to WTC hijacker Mohammed Atta from Pakistan by
          Ahmad Umar Sheikh
          at the instance of Gen Mahmud. Senior government sources have
          confirmed
          that India contributed significantly to establishing the link
          between the
          money transfer and the role played by the dismissed ISI chief.
          While they
          did not provide details, they said that Indian inputs,
          including Sheikh's
          mobile phone number, helped the FBI in tracing and
          establishing the link."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These three news items,
          taken together,
          shine a devastating spotlight on the events preceding, and
          following, 9/11.
          The first item, the Karachi report of September 9, serves to
          highlight
          the ISI chief's "unusual" visit in the days immediately
          preceding 9/11.
          Yet with the subsequent revelations of The Times of India
          report, this
          visit starts to take on sinister implications. But again, as I
          said before,
          if there is Pakistani - read, ISI - involvement in the WTC
          bombings, there
          is little reason to believe that Pakistan's involvement was
          anything more
          than that of a proxy agent serving the interests of a powerful
          controller.
          Some might assail the credibility of the Times of India
          article in light
          of India's state of belligerence with Pakistan. Yet both the
          Karachi report
          and the ABC report tend to lend credibility to the Indian
          report, not only
          because they both precede the Times of India by a matter of
          weeks, but
          most importantly in light of the fact of what is omitted in
          each. The Indian
          article, if part of a smear campaign against the ISI chief,
          would surely
          have highlighted the well-timed visit of the ISI chief to
          Washington. Or
          would it - for surely such a revelation in conjunction with
          its report
          would unavoidably implicate a player whose overwhelming power
          could be
          used as a vengeful bludgeon against Indian interests: the
          United States.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Examining the implications
          more deeply,
          the ABC report blatantly references the FBI as the source for
          the $100,000
          revelation, calling in TIME magazine to make the bin Laden
          link and thereby
          cementing another brick in the case against al-Qaida. Yet any
          propaganda
          gains made by this revelation were immediately threatened by
          the blowback
          of the Times of India report several days later. In other
          words, this was
          a "limited hang-out" that went disastrously wrong. No matter.
          The US authorities
          immediately went into damage control mode by insisting on the
          quiet retirement
          of the "outed" ISI chief. Thus removed from the public eye,
          the Lt-Gen's
          role in all this could be effectively ignored, and an American
          media black-out
          could be safely assumed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such a scenario certainly
          fits in
          snugly
          with my hypothesis, which I will now proceed to elaborate
          completely. The
          events of September 11 were masterminded by those who were in
          the best
          position to manage the consequences - namely, those most able
          to manage
          the flow of information, those most able to coordinate all the
          elements
          necessary for the perpetration of a successful operation
          (subverting airport
          security, guiding the planes to their specific targets), and
          most significantly,
          those who stood to reasonably benefit in the aftermath.
          Conspiracies, by
          their very nature, are not crimes of passion. They may involve
          rational,
          albeit cold-blooded, attempts to achieve a desired end by
          employing the
          most effective means available. It is for this reason that
          "mainstream"
          terror groups like Hamas and Hizbullah largely avoid attacking
          American
          interests where such attacks would serve no practical
          interest. For all
          their talk of Jihad, these terror groups tend to plan their
          specific attacks
          with an eye to the consequences that could reasonably be
          expected to follow.
          Thus, knowing the moral and political constraints of Israeli
          deterrent
          strategies, they calibrate their attacks to elicit
          consequences that are
          most tolerable for them - and hence, manageable. Yet surely,
          in the light
          of the cult of suicidal martyrdom, such considerations no
          longer hold sway.
          Perhaps. But then, in the case of such a far-flung
          anti-Zionist movement
          as al-Qaida, one would expect at least a little more exertion
          against Israeli
          interests than has heretofore prevailed - unless, of course,
          the "point"
          of al-Qaida was to provide a plausible dire threat to American
          interests
          where none had then existed. In any case, as nobody has
          noticed this particular
          anomaly, there was no need for any needless exertion of
          resources in order
          to bolster a credibility that needed no bolstering in this one
          particular
          sector.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Motive, means, and
          opportunity. While
          I presented the Saudis and Pakistani intelligence as clear-cut
          proxies,
          the only motive these elements would have to benefit from a
          crime of this
          nature is an assurance that no punishment would be forthcoming
          but rather,
          they would be on the right side of power and wealth among
          those in a position
          to determine the booty. In the light of this supposition, it
          is clear as
          to why the American media and government have steadfastly
          avoided any substantive
          investigations of Pakistani and Saudi involvement. And I am
          not the first
          to notice that particular anomaly.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another anomaly: only two
          days before
          September 11, the head of the Afghani National Alliance - a
          cultishly popular
          figure within that group, and one who stood adamantly for
          Afghani independence
          - was assassinated by two terrorists posing as cameramen.
          Keeping in mind
          the fact that, throughout the '90's, American leaders such as
          Clinton,
          and American companies such as Unocal, were largely throwing
          their support
          over to the Taliban in opposition to the National Alliance, it
          seems rather
          convenient that, in the aftermath of 9/11, the way was now
          cleared for
          the National Alliance to be co-opted as an instrument for
          setting up a
          more pliant Afghani government (now headed, incidentally, by a
          former consultant
          to Unocal). One wonders what the fiercely independent,
          now-deceased, former
          leader of the National Alliance would have had to say on that
          point.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So who are the ultimate
          controllers?
          To begin with, the circumstantial evidence seems to point to
          an operative
          clique primarily based out of New York City and the State of
          Florida. I
          stress the word "operative", as this clique appears to be
          subservient agents
          involved in laying the preparations. Once again, John O'Neill
          serves as
          an effective Rosetta Stone in interpreting the raw outlines of
          this operative
          clique (which is by no means a "rogue" clique). The FBI and
          CIA elements
          involved in counterterrorism have a checkered past. For one,
          Oliver North
          in the 1980's served as Counterterrorism Chief while he used
          his office
          as a cover to deal with such narco-terrorists as Monzar
          al-Kassar (who
          figures in the crash at Lockerbie - also investigated by
          Cannistraro).
          In the late '90's, O'Neill was transferred from the federal
          office of Counterrorism
          to the New York Counterrorism Office of the FBI - and it was
          the New York
          branch which was then designated as the primary investigator
          of all overseas
          investigations involving bin Laden. Moreover, this branch was
          also involved
          in the somewhat suspect investigation of TWA 800 -
          investigated by O'Neill
          and reported upon by ABC's John Miller, who was formerly the
          Deputy Police
          Commissioner of Public Relations for the NYPD before he joined
          up with
          ABC. As regards New York, there is another element involved in
          germ warfare
          operations. Actually, a multi-million dollar bunker - serving
          as a command
          and control center in the event of a biological attack - was
          set up at
          7 World Trade Center at the direction of Rudolph Giuliani, who
          also oversaw
          a mass spraying over the boroughs of New York City when the
          West Nile Virus
          hit town a few summers previously.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Moreover, there has been a
          widespread
          campaign on to link the threat of al-Qaida with that of a mass
          biological
          attack. At least the day after September 11, the link - as the
          Anthrax
          mailings had yet to arise - was not so apparent. Yet on PBS'
          Frontline,
          the New York Times' Judith Miller (no apparent relation to
          John Miller,
          as far as I'm aware), accompanied by the New York Times' James
          Risen, was
          interviewed as an apparent expert on al-Qaida. Several weeks
          later, Judith
          Miller would once more make the headlines as the apparent
          recipient of
          an anthrax mailing which turned out to be a false alarm - yet
          was all the
          same conveniently timed with the well-publicized launching of
          her book
          on...germ warfare. Thus, with Ms. Miller, we have the
          interesting synchronicity
          of someone who, on September 12, unveiled herself before a
          television audience
          as an al-Qaida expert, while only weeks later, presenting
          herself as an
          authority on biowarfare - while at the same time making the
          news as a presumed
          anthrax recipient, targeted - as initially presumed - by
          al-Qaida elements.
          As was later discovered, the anthrax mailings petered out once
          the news
          leaked that a DNA test revealed the material to be of the Ames
          strain of
          anthrax, an agent synthesized out of a CIA laboratory in Fort
          Detrick,
          Maryland. Nevertheless, this was sufficient to fast-track
          Bioport's exclusive
          license for the anthrax vaccine toward FDA approval. Formerly,
          Bioport's
          experimental anthrax vaccine was being forcibly administered -
          under threat
          of court-martial - to hundreds of thousands of American
          servicemen (in
          conformity with Bioport's exclusive and lucrative contract
          with the Department
          of Defense). The point of the above-noted information is to
          draw attention
          to an apparent propaganda campaign to prepare the public for a
          catastrophic
          biological attack. As with the Twin Towers, the blame for any
          coming attack
          may be duly and plausibly assigned by those who carefully laid
          the groundwork
          in preparing us for this eventuality. I do not claim to know
          the motive
          behind any possible widespread biological attack - be it for
          population
          control or for other reasons beyond my ken - yet I do perceive
          a concerted
          effort to link the fear of al-Qaida with the fear of a
          catastrophic biological
          attack. For those interested in investigating this further, I
          suggest that
          one "place" to start is the New York operative clique centered
          in the New
          York Counterrorism branch, as well as minor elements of the
          NYPD (by way
          of John Miller and Giuliani) and certain elements based out of
          Long Island
          University (Harvey Kushner).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As for Florida, the
          connection with
          this state is obvious, for not only was the first anthrax
          mailing directed
          to the Florida offices of the National Enquirer, but the
          accused hijackers
          were also reported to receive their pilot training from flight
          schools
          in Orlando and Tampa. Moreover, Florida, by way of the MacDill
          Air Force
          Base, is also Central Command for the war in Afghanistan. And
          again, there
          is a John O'Neill connection - for not only did O'Neill meet
          his professional
          undoing at a convention in Tampa, but in an Associated Press
          article dated
          May 24, 1997, John O'Neill was commenting on the threat of
          Islamic terrorism
          while the same article pointed out the existence of a
          Tampa-based "think
          tank" possibly linked with terrorists - the World and Islam
          Studies Enterprise.
          In addition to its function as Central Command for the war on
          terrorism,
          MacDill is -outside of Langley - also a major base of the CIA.
          Thus, in
          the CIA's own backyard, we find the infrastructure and
          financial support
          that went into the planning for the events of 9/11. And, as we
          so often
          find with events surrounding 9/11, another synchronicity - for
          coincidentally
          enough, the woman who happened to find an apartment for one of
          the alleged
          hijackers was the wife of the senior editor of the National
          Enquirer. Moreover,
          her husband, Michael Irish, also happened to make use of an
          airfield that
          served as flight training for some of the hijackers. In
          intelligence operations,
          foreign assets are often placed with resident "controllers"
          whose job it
          is to supervise the asset as well as provide accommodations as
          the need
          arises. Who are Michael and Gloria Irish? Or, perhaps more
          revealingly,
          what kind of social circles do they run with? This is
          certainly an avenue
          worth exploring - by reason of its many synchrocities if for
          nothing else.
          Again, the seam that shows.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, to sum up, it appears
          that the
          events of September 11 were planned years in advance, with the
          groundwork
          being carefully laid by a propaganda campaign orchestrated to
          convince
          the public that the United States has a plausibly
          sophisticated nemesis
          with the motive, means, and opportunity to perpetrate a
          devastating act
          of terror against Americans. Toward that end, Saudi Arabia and
          Pakistan
          have been used as the primary proxy agents to run a "false
          flag" operation,
          setting up and financing the infrastructure of al-Qaida in
          Afghanistan.
          Through madrassas based in Pakistan, Saudi and Yemenite
          militants were
          instructed in the Saudi brand of Wahabbi Islam, and
          subsequently "graduated"
          to the camps that were set up in Afghanistan - again, under
          Saudi and Pakistani
          sponsorship. Stateside, the operative agents were mostly based
          out of New
          York City and Florida. In the aftermath of 9/11, elements in
          the American
          government are now widely disseminating information in vast
          quantities,
          overwhelming the populace and lending credibility to the
          government's version
          of events. Thus, post-9/11, the actions of this formerly
          insular propaganda
          clique are no longer perceptible. Information is now being
          doled out in
          generous portions to credulous reporters who are outside the
          loop, yet
          perform their unwitting service as "bottoms feeders" in the
          downward flow
          of information.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In all cases, the actions of
          these
          proxy agents and operative planners are sufficiently distanced
          and compartmentalized
          from the true masterminds to create a condition of "plausible
          deniability".
          In short, the proxies have also been set up as possible
          patsies with evidence
          that has been carefully laid to incriminate them should cracks
          in the "official
          story" become too discernible. Moreover, the groundwork has
          already been
          carefully laid to cast aspersions on another convenient patsy
          - the Jews,
          by way of the State of Israel and its supporters. Already, for
          those prone
          to perceive Jewish conspiracies, the reliable vein of
          anti-semitism - combined
          with anti-Zionism - has been mined to distract the masses and
          to create
          a modern version of the ritual blood libel, thereby further
          "muddying the
          waters" should the true masterminds be threatened with
          exposure. In other
          words, the present difficulties in the Middle East work
          perfectly to set
          up the State of Israel as a plausible alternative suspect with
          motive,
          means, and opportunity. Toward that end, a low-level "buzz"
          has been circulating
          over the Internet (and especially in Europe) - fueled by a coy
          report from
          Fox News - of an Israeli spy ring that was rounded up in the
          days after
          September 11. Whether or not these reports are credible is not
          the point.
          Most likely, there was a spy ring operating, and various
          Israelis were
          unwittingly set up as patsies, to be exposed should the need
          arise. Thus,
          while evidence may be marshalled to taint the Saudis,
          Pakistanis, and Israelis,
          the real guilt must inevitably lie with those in the best
          position to manage
          the flow of information as well as reliably benefit from the
          new order
          created, primarily, the political and corporate elites of the
          United States,
          the United Kingdom, and the European Union - also, as it
          happens, the very
          parties orchestrating the global war on terrorism. In this
          respect, the
          Saudis, Pakistanis, or Israelis have far less to gain (other
          than the benefits
          of going along with the designs of the rich and mighty).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I could go on and further
          highlight
          the obvious geostrategic gains of those who are clearly
          managing the flow
          of information - the proverbial pipelines, oil, wealth, and so
          forth. But
          I think those purported benefits are a bit of a "red herring"
          - more of
          a side benefit than the main motivating factor. It is no small
          act to intentionally
          take down such an overarching symbol of financial stability as
          the Twin
          Towers, and chance killing thousands in the process. Such a
          conspiracy,
          if in fact perpetrated from within, would by its nature
          necessitate a huge
          structural, cultural, and demographic change. The very
          brazenness of the
          act, the naked aggression, would necessitate a tenacious
          determination
          to achieve the ends for which these actions were perpetrated.
          There is
          no going back now. An infrastructure is being laid out - one
          that will,
          finally, provide a dissident-proof totalitarian oligarchy
          composed of like-minded
          elites served by an under-class kept under constant
          surveillance. The edifice
          of this regime is being constructed, brick by brick, with the
          mortar of
          the Office of Homeland Security (to centralize and coordinate
          an effective
          police state), the Freedom Corps (to indoctrinate the most
          idealist - and
          therefore activist - elements of the populace toward service
          to the state),
          and the Patriot Act (to provide the legal basis for subverting
          long-held
          rights under the screen of national security). If all of this
          sounds strangely
          familiar, if it is redolent of Huxley and Orwell, that is
          perhaps because
          Huxley and Orwell were both intimately involved with the
          elites of their
          time - in fact, were fully subsumed among them - in ways that
          made their
          future projections abundantly prescient, and, in their minds,
          inevitable.
          With further refinements in mind control technologies - yes,
          they do exist
          - as well as the monopolization of the food supply by way of
          sterile seed
          "terminator technology" - the approval for which was granted
          in the months
          following 9/11 - the masses may be perpetually culled and
          exploited by
          those who hold the keys to this fully managed society.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For such a plan to be
          effective,
          there is no need for all elements to be "in the loop." Many
          look upon the
          Council On Foreign Relations (CFR) as one likely agent of a
          possible elitist
          conspiracy. Yet with a membership consisting of thousands, it
          would be
          too unwieldly to manage such a group of individuals with such
          varying interests
          and outlooks. In any case, that is not how the CFR is
          structured. Members
          of the CFR are invited into the ranks - particularly where
          they have already
          achieved some measure of prominence in politics, finance, or
          the media.
          The CFR, rather, exists as an organ to manage these
          "second-tier" elites
          - to ensure a consensus of sorts simply through the technique
          of "mainstreaming"
          their thoughts and beliefs, as these are folk who are unduly
          preoccupied
          with preserving their status in the ranking order. No need to
          "rock the
          boat" with foolish notions that could only serve to discredit
          oneself in
          the eyes of one's peers. Standing over and above the CFR is a
          more manageable
          and, on the whole, more powerful group of elites who do, in
          fact, perceive
          it as their duty and entitlement to determine the mores and
          values, lifestyles
          and fate of the rest of us. Where the rank and file members of
          the CFR
          are largely motivated by a self-interested careerism, these
          higher elites
          see it as their moral duty to guide the "ship of state", as it
          were. To
          them, a unified world government is the most logical way to
          manage the
          affairs of the world. After all, these global elites have more
          in common
          with one another than they do with the bulk of their
          respective countrymen.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If this notion of reality
          strikes
          you as somewhat dissonant, at odds with your own personal
          experience, it
          may be perhaps that we have not quite arrived there yet, and
          that you have
          personally not felt the corrosive lash of political corruption
          and governmental
          malfeasance. In all likelihood, you have not read the mountain
          of evidence
          detailing political and elite deviant behaviour in this
          country. You may
          even be dismissive of "conspiracies theories", yet wholly
          unaware of the
          well-documented attempts by the CIA and FBI to subvert,
          surveill, and propagandize
          the populace through programs such as Project Mockingbird
          (media infiltration)
          and MK-Ultra (mind control through chemical, hypnotic, or
          electro-magnetic
          means). These programs are effected primarily through "think
          tanks" that
          are set up across the United States for the purpose of
          disseminating information
          and propaganda under the rubric of "expertise". Moreover,
          various foundations,
          such as the Rockefeller or Ford Foundations, are often used as
          funnels
          to finance and feed the arteries of these propaganda networks.
          In the 1970's,
          a good deal of this structural corruption was officially
          exposed - in a
          "limited hang-out" - by way of the Church Commission, as well
          as the House
          Select Committee on Assassinations. Thereafter, much of the
          most damaging
          revelations were played down or ignored by the mainstream
          media, and the
          waters were then muddied by a stream of outlandish conspiracy
          theories
          - aliens, Elvis, etc. - that merely served to discredit the
          information
          that was most credible. "Muddying the waters", incidentally,
          is a tried
          and true staple of the intelligence craft.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is really just a matter
          of familiarizing
          yourself with all the documented anomalies that do not accord
          with the
          received, mainstream reality put forth to you by the
          mainstream media.
          As a practical guide to begin, you might want to confine your
          search to
          strictly "mainstream" sources, as I have sought to do in
          attempting to
          construct my case on 9/11. My evidence is by no means
          exhaustive. In fact,
          it is merely the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Yet proceeding
          in this
          direction, under my hypothesis, has been most fruitful in
          analyzing the
          various anomalies that pop up now and then.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Any simple keyword search of
          the
          following terms may be helpful in pointing toward a more
          substantive understanding
          of the elites who ultimately guide your fortunes:
          "Iran-Contra" , "Mena",
          "BCCI", "Project Paperclip", "Michael Aquino", "Paul Bonacci",
          "Operation
          Northwoods", "MK-Ultra". Much of the information on these
          topics is credible
          and well-documented. More disturbingly, it highlights
          behaviour committed
          by the very same elites who are now interpreting the events of
          9/11 for
          you. Read for yourself, and decide, at the end of the day, how
          much credibility
          you will continue to accord to those who claim to be the
          proper trustees
          of your fate and well-being.</font></p>
