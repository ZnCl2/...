        The disposition of nuclear waste is one of the most serious
        technical challenges facing humanity. Long-term storage is not
        acceptable, yet it is all that we can do with the mess at this
        time. Meanwhile, many physicists are developing methods to
        render nuclear waste inactive by various forms of transmutation,
        the conversion of one element into another.</font>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rapid transmutation of
          radioactive elements to stable daughter elements can be
          accomplished in several ways. The first such method was
          proposed by Dr. Radha Roy (Physics Dept, Arizona State Univ.)
          in 1979. He used a linear accelerator to generate x-rays that
          knocked nuclei from the target elements (Cesium-137 and
          Strontium-90), resulting in short-lived isotopes. His work
          received notice in the <i>New York Times</i> in 1982 (April 6
          &amp; 13). Only 20 year later, the Los Alamos National
          Laboratory is developing a project for "Accelerator
          Transmutation of Waste". A prototype plant will be constructed
          within five years. Two US Patents have been granted for the
          transmutation of nuclear waste with thermal neutron flux:
          #5,160,696 and #4,721,596 to Charles Bowman and Richard
          Marriott, <i>et al</i>., respectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scientists at Europe’s CERN
          facility also are experimenting with "sub-critical" nuclear
          reactions (they cease when not being triggered by a linear
          accelerator) that curtail&nbsp; radioactivity. The proposed
          European system has been named "Energy Amplifier" by Carlo
          Rubbia, the Nobel Prize winning physicist who designed it. The
          CERN website offers this explanation of their efforts:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Intense linear accelerators
          would allow transmutation of long-lived nuclear waste which
          rapidly decays to become harmless or alternatively provide the
          beam which drives the Energy Amplifier -- a failsafe form of
          nuclear reactor using relatively innocuous thorium as its
          fuel."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The CERN Energy Amplifier
          would work by inserting tubes of radioactive isotopes into a
          block of lead. Protons fired into the lead by a linear
          accelerator would generate high-energy neutrons that would
          fission the target waste. When the neutrons pass through the
          resonant energy levels of the target isotopes, they trigger
          transmutation reactions. The molten lead also would serve to
          cool the system by its passage through a heat exchanger, and
          the waste heat could be used to generate electricity. The
          corrosive lead will be bubbled with oxygen to allow the
          formation of a protective coat of oxide on the reactor walls.
          The system has been criticized as too complex, and to date the
          researchers have only performed simulations and conducted a
          few experiments on isolated aspects of the system. For
          example, the CERN scientists have transmuted Technetium-99 in
          a lead block.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Americans and Europeans
          refuse to cooperate on the project; each group claims the
          other has copied their ideas.</font> </p>
      <p>In August 2003, Ken Ledingham (University of Strathclyde,
        Glasgow) announced in the Journal of Physics (D: Applied
        Physics) that the transmutation of nuclear waste had been
        accomplished by means of the giant Vulcan laser (Rutherford
        Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire). The toxicity of a few million
        atoms of iodine-129 was reduced by a factor of 100 in just a few
        minutes. The end&nbsp; product iodine -128 has a halflife of
        only25 minutes, while the halflife of iodine -129 is 15.7
        million years. The Vulcan laser fired a pulse of&nbsp; a million
        billion watts at a gold target, which generated gamma rays that
        detached neutrons from I-129, resulting in I-128. </p>
      <p>According to Ledingham,&nbsp; the technique could be applied to
        other radioactive wastes such technetium-99, strontium-90 and
        caesium isotopes. A different process would be required for
        plutonium and americium and other radioactive isotopes. The
        laser process, however, requires enormous amounts of power. The
        Vulcan laser would have to be fired 1017 times to transmute all
        the atoms of the 46-gram target mass. </p>
      <p>Research team member Karl Krushelnick, a laser physicist
        (Imperial College, London), said, "You would need to build a
        number of power stations to transmute the waste from another
        power station". </p>
      <p>Although the laser opens a new pathway to the deactivation of
        nuclear waste, it also requires that the spent reactor fuel be
        reprocessed. Ian McKinley, from the Swiss company, Nagra, which
        processes nuclear waste, reprocessing is "extremely expensive
        and increasingly unpopular". </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fortunately, there are
          several other, relatively simpler ways to solve the problem.
          Soon after Pons and Fleischman announced the discovery of Cold
          Fusion (CF) in 1989, researchers began to announce the
          anomalous production of elements, beginning with helium and
          tritium and continuing into the heavy atoms. By 1995, about
          120 papers had reported the CF production of tritium in
          experiments with palladium. During the same period, several
          scientists developed applications of CF for the remediation of
          nuclear waste.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Early in 2000, Dr. S.X. Jin,
          Chief Scientist at Trenergy, Inc., announced his design for a
          new type of proton particle accelerator that would generate up
          to one million times greater proton density at the target than
          any existing particle accelerators. Hal Fox, editor of the <i>Journal






            of New Energy</i> in which the report appeared, offered his
          opinion of the new technology:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In my judgement, the
          development of this new technology would allow for the on-site
          transmutation of high-level radioactive wastes into stable
          elements. Billions of dollars can be saved by not packaging,
          transporting and storing these wastes in geological storage
          for 10,000 years."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the early 1990s,
          physicist Ken Shoulders received five patents for his
          discovery of the High Density Charge Cluster (HDCC), "a
          relatively discrete, self-contained, negatively charged, high
          density state of matter... [a bundle of electrons that]
          appears to be produced by the application of a high electrical
          field between a cathode and an anode" (i.e., 2-10 kv at the
          tip of a sharply pointed electrode). It can also be described
          as "a spherical monopole oscillator". Shoulders has given it
          the name "Electrum Validum" (EV), meaning "strong electron",
          derived from the Greek "elektron" (electronic charge) and the
          Latin "valere" (to be strong, having power to unite).
          Shoulders also invented a method of Plasma-Injected
          Transmutation for the remediation of nuclear waste by EVs. He
          has demonstrated the complete elimination of radioactivity in
          high-level nuclear material. <b>(1-4)</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">EVs apparently function as a
          collective accelerator with sufficient energy to inject a
          large group of nuclei into a target and promote nuclear
          cluster reactions. The composition of EVs allows for the
          inclusion of some 10<sup>5</sup> nuclides. Ions can be added
          to EVs until the net charge becomes positive. Such EVs are
          called Nuclide-EVs (NEVs). Shoulders states:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The NEV acts as an
          ultra-massive, negative ion with high charge-to-mass ratio.
          This provides the function of a simple nuclear accelerator.
          Such nuclear reactions are fundamentally an event involving
          large numbers and not one of widely isolated events working at
          an atomic level."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shoulders offers an <i>ad
            hoc</i> explanation of these results as being "due largely
          to a <i>nuclear cluster reaction</i> having an unknown form
          of coherence."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Other researchers (Rod Neal,
          Stan Gleeson, "The Cincinatti Group", William Barker, etc.)
          also applied for patents on similar applications. The
          Neal-Gleeson Process has been shown to stabilize naturally
          radioactive solutions of thorium and uranium compounds up to
          70% within a few hours in an electrochemical reactor. Thorium
          can be fissioned into mercury and neon. Valve metals (whose
          oxides emit electrons) can be excited to produce
          galvano-luminescence in aqueous solution. When the charge
          gradient exceeds a critical threshold of 1 MeV, sparks are
          produced in the form of charge clusters that are believed to
          be the active mechanism in this method of transmutation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In their reports of the
          experimental results, Neal and Gleeson, <i>et al</i>., noted:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Because there is a close
          agreement between the reduction in thorium and the reduction
          of radioactivity of the thorium daughter products, it is
          assumed that the Neal-Gleeson Process has about the same
          capability to change both thorium nuclei and the nuclei of the
          daughter products into other elements which are not
          radioactive...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A process which can cause
          the higher atomic number elements to be split into smaller
          elements appears to be a desirable method by which certain
          radioactive elements can be handled. It is highly desirable to
          be able to select process-control parameters so that only
          stable daughter nuclei of the parent elements are produced. In
          this way, the radioactivity of today's highly radioactive
          slurries can be ameliorated."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Australian inventor Yull
          Brown developed a novel method of electrolyzing water to
          produce a compressed stoichometric mixture of hydrogen and
          oxygen ions (popularly known as "Brown's Gas") that is burned
          in a 2:1 ration. Since the early 1980s, Yull Brown claimed to
          be able to transmute radioactive material into inert forms by
          fusing it in the flame produced by his hyfuel. His patents
          mention that "The invention also relates to <i>atomic</i>
          welding..." (USP 4,014,777 and 4,081,656).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Yull Brown's first
          successful experiment with Co<sub>60</sub> radionuclides
          reduced the activity by about 50% in 10 minutes. The process
          was replicated by the Baotou Nuclear Institute (China) in
          1991.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a demonstration witnessed
          by former US Congressman Berkeley Bedell, the radioactivity of
          Americium was quickly reduced by 2500% with Brown's torch. The
          Geiger counter reading registered 16,000 curies/minute before,
          and less than 100 curies/minute after treatment. Congressman
          Bedell said:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It has been my good
          pleasure to witness experiments done by Prof. Yull Brown in
          which it appeared to me that he significantly reduced the
          radioactivity in several nuclear materials. Under the
          circumstances, I believe it is very important for our federal
          government to completely investigate Dr. Yull Brown's
          accomplishments in this area."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the US government is
          completely investigating Brown's Gas, it is doing so in
          complete secrecy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In August 1992, Yull Brown
          made another demonstration before several members of the
          Department of Energy and Hon. Dan Haley at the request of
          Congressman Bedell. The Geiger counter reading from Co<sub>60</sub>
          was reduced to 0.04% of the original level.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another demonstration was
          conducted for a group of Japanese nuclear scientists, at which

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Paul Brown (Nuclear
          Solutions, Aurora CO) has developed a novel method to
          remediate nuclear waste by photonuclear reaction with gamma
          rays. The technology utilizes principles of physics --- giant
          dipole resonance --- that have been overlooked in their
          possible application in treatment of nuclear waste. Brown
          states:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Photonuclear reactions
          induced by gamma ray absorption by the nucleus, do not suffer
          the shortcomings of neutron reactions. Simply stated, the
          process is gamma irradiation with energies greater than the
          binding energy of the neutron to the nucleus. That is, a gamma
          photon of an energy equal to or greater than the binding
          energy which comes close to the nucleus is absorbed through
          giant dipole resonance resulting in the emission of a neutron.
          This well-known nuclear reaction has dramatic application to
          waste remediation...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The neutrons produced by
          the (¡,h) processing may in turn be used for neutron
          transmutation by the processes... For many fission products
          the neutron capture cross sections in a thermal spectrum can
          give substantial transmutation rates..."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Brown has proposed another
          application of giant dipole resonance in a theoretical&nbsp;
          "Photon Reactor" that would produce power by burning nuclear
          waste:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A linear accelerator,
          preferably of the monochromatic type, accelerates electrons
          which are directed onto a high Z target such as tungsten to
          generate gamma rays about 9 MeV, which are directed onto the
          fuel material such as U-238 which results in the (g,¦)
          reaction, thus releasing about 200 MeV. A reactor built
          according to this principle requiring an accelerator driven by
          1 MeV will develop about 20 MW of power. The reaction is not
          self-sustaining and stops when the beam is turned off. This
          accelerator driven reactor may be used to burn up spent fuel
          from fission reactors, if simply operated at 10 MeV. The
          photo-fission results in typical spent fuel waste products
          such as Cs<sup>137</sup> and Sr<sup>90</sup>, which undergo
          photodisintegration by the (g,¦) resulting in short-lived or
          stable products. Chemical separation of the spent fuel
          isotopes is not necessary..." <b>(8)</b></font> </p>

          electrical energy directly from the atom:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"ADEC does not change the
          mechanism of spontaneous radioactive decay; it changes the
          probability of which atoms will undergo decay and when the

          event of a neighboring atom's spontaneous decay in no way
          influence the likelihood or unlikelihood of decay of a
          selected atom. As the extraction of power from the nuclear is

          Sciences) has presented theoretical and experimental evidence
          for the validity of his own "Nucleon Cluster Model" (NCM),
          which predicts that a relatively low-energy photon can promote
          a nuclear reaction under certain specific conditions.
          Brightson analyzed the periodicities and systematics of atomic
          numbers and masses and deduced that all b-stable nuclides are
          composed of deuterons (NP clusters), tritons (NPN), and He<sub>3</sub>
          (PNP) nuclei. His patent application includes a method of
          remediating nuclear waste by the induction of fission in the
          radioactive isotopes. The imposition of an external magnetic
          field in resonance with the magnetic moment of a particular
          nucleon cluster (NP, NPN, PNP) can excite the select cluster
          (without disturbing other clusters in the target) to burst

          geophysicist Dr. Georgiy S. Rabzi developed methods of
          transmutation that combined geo-electric and artificial fields
          and temperature control to direct transmutation in solids and
          liquids. For example, a 99.5% Pb was treated at 650<sup>o</sup>C
          to yield up to 3% Ag, plus Cd and Ge (15 March 1994). No
          radioactivity was observed in any of the experiments. At the
          ICCF-5 meeting, Dr Rabzi claimed that his "natural cold
          fission" is a safe method with which to stabilize nuclear
          waste.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Numerous reports in the
          literature of physics describe deviations (from 0.1 to 5%)
          from the standard constant decay rates of natural
          radioactivity, some by extra-nuclear influences (including the
          human mind). Physicists Elizabeth Rauscher, Glen Rein, and
          associates have investigated the interactions of Co<sub>60</sub>
          with non-Hertzian energies such as the scalar fields generated
          by the "Smith Coil" (a Caduceus-wound coil invented by
          Canadian engineer Wilbur B. Smith in the 1960s). When
          energized (3 mA/5 W), The non-inductive Smith Coil (8.2 ohms)
          reduced the background radiation by 97% (from 0.5 mR/hr to
          0.0015 mR/hr). Yet when applied to Co<sub>60</sub>, the
          radioactivity <u>increased</u> from 150 to 250 mR/hr! <b>(10)</b></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gerardo International, Inc.
          has developed an "Accelerated Decay Energy Converter" (ADEC)
          that makes use of stimulated nuclear decay to directly extract
          electrical energy from radioactive material. ADEC changes the
          probability of atomic decay and its timing: "As atoms exhibit
          no statistical memory, the event of a neighboring atom's
          spontaneous decay in no way influence the likelihood or
          unlikelihood of decay of a selected atom. As the extraction of
          power from the nuclear material is accelerated, the material's
          natural emissive lifetime will be exhausted in direct
          relation."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A few other exotic
          possibilities may exist for the transmutation of nuclear
          waste, such as the radionic transmutations demonstrated by the
          amazing DeLaWarr Camera. Tom Beardon and others have
          recommended the use of scalar interferometry to withdraw
          energy from the nucleus in a gentle manner, or by outright
          dematerialization. <b>(11)</b></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thomas Bearden proposes a
          method that "may be used to hasten the decay of long-lived and
          dangerous radioactive isotopes" in his US Patent Application,
          "Method, System &amp; Apparatus for Conditioning EM
          Potentials, Fields &amp; Waves to Treat &amp; Alter Matter":</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"A further discussion will
          explain the particular mechanisms involved in modifying the
          decay rates of nuclear materials. Nuclear physics models
          assume that, within a heavy slow-decaying nucleus, there are
          particles that "rattle around" a very large number of times
          before spontaneously tunneling through the surface and
          escaping, to provide ? decay. For the long-lived decay of
          238U, e.g., the ? particle must present itself at the barrier
          some 1038 times before it succeeds in tunneling through. Hence
          an ?-decay will likely occur on the average of once every 4
          billion years! The disintegration energy of this long-lived
          238U nucleus is 4.25 MeV. However, the transmission
          coefficient of a barrier is very sensitive to small changes in
          the total energy of the particle seeking to penetrate it. As
          an example, a change in the disintegration energy to 6.81 MeV
          results in barrier penetration of the ? particle very quickly
          -- indeed, in only 9.1 minutes. By use of time-density
          charging, it is straightforward to raise the disintegration
          energy of an otherwise long-lived 238U isotope to 6.81 MeV or
          even higher, after a certain longitudinal EM wave radiation
          time. (In this instance, the addition of necessary phase
          conjugates to accomplish time-density charging happens in the
          vicinity of the irradiated nuclear mass.) It follows that a
          readily usable process can be designed to decay the long lived
          238U isotope quickly, and similarly with other radioactive
          isotopes having very long half-lives. Indeed, "mixes" of
          appropriate spacetime curvature engines can be designed to
          minimize actual radioactive emission, with the vacuum itself
          undergoing energetic processes that accept the excess energy
          in virtual state rather than radiating it away into 3-space as
          observable transversely-polarized nuclear decay contaminants.
          Nuclear wastes can be irradiated at a safe distance by an
          interferometer such as 1600. Alternatively, the interferometer
          1600 can condition the local vacuum in a specified disposal
          region by projecting the desired spacetime curvature engines,
          which become imposed on matter in the region by time-charging
          and subsequently emitted over a period of time through the
          process of excitation decay. Then the isotopes to be nullified
          can just be transported into the area and "parked" there while
          the conditioned active vacuum performs the necessary
          nullifying electronuclear interactions.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Fig. 19 shows an apparatus
          that may serve to alter and nullify hazardous chemical wastes
          by creating time-reversal zones within a reaction vessel. A
          time-reversal zone has the characteristic of reversing the
          electrical attraction and repulsion forces upon many charges
          within the zone. In such a zone, a hydrogen bond may become an
          anti-hydrogen-bond, thus loosening the bonds. As the bonds
          break, the chemicals may be altered to harmless new forms. As
          an example, the H-bond interactions in a hazardous chemical
          compound are due to protons. As time passes and the
          time-reversal zone strengthens due to time-density charging,
          the exposed hydrogen ions (protons) in the chemical acquire
          additional time-density charge, whereupon some begin to repel
          (due to the time-reversal of their attraction) while others
          continue to attract (due to the remaining time-forward
          component). As the time-reversal strengthens, repulsion equals
          and overtakes attraction, thereby dissolving the H-bond. The
          chemical thereby separates into component parts and component
          chemicals. Exposure can continue until the remaining chemical
          byproducts are harmless. In this manner, hazardous chemicals
          including dangerous chemical warfare agents may be rendered
          harmless. For the safety of operating personnel, the
          time-reversal zone may be established inside a protective
          reaction vessel from a little distance away..."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Radioactivity also can be <u>increased</u>
          by simple means. The German Dr. Alois Gaschler applied for a
          British patent in 1925 for the enrichment of uranium by a
          treatment with several kilowatts of direct current:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The behavior of uranium and
          thorium and their salts in the electric arc and in the glow
          discharge has been examined. In no case could there be
          observed an alteration in the radioactivity or in the chemical
          activity. A perceptible transmutation effect was, however,
          unexpectedly found when strong rushes of momentary
          high-tension currents were sent through a narrow fused quartz
          tube provided with tungsten electrodes and containing mercury
          and uranium oxide. The tube was fixed vertically in a stand,
          so that the mercury filled the lower part of the tube and one
          tungsten electrode was completely covered by it. On the
          surface of the mercury was a relatively thin coating of
          uranium oxide which had been carefully freed from radioactive
          by-products, especially from uranium-X, before it was
          introduced into the quartz tube. The sparking distance between
          the tungsten electrode and the mercury-uranium oxide electrode
          was about 15 cm. The intensity of the electric discharge
          varied between 0.3 and 0.4 amps.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Under the influence of
          repeated electric discharges during about 30 hours, relatively
          strong and increasing radioactivity b and l rays] showed
          itself. The b and l ray activity varied between 1.4 and 20
          times the radioactivity of an equally large amount of uranium
          oxide in equilibrium with its decay products, and increased
          proportionally to the energy applied and to the time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"One obtains an even greater
          proportion of uranium X if one makes the electric discharges
          pass within a thick-sided quartz or porcelain vessel between a
          tungsten point and mercury covered with a thin coat of
          vaseline and uranium oxide. This coating possesses such a high
          electric resistance that, even when applying the highest
          tensions which can be obtained, one is obliged to diminish
          greatly the sparking distance in order to obtain a discharge.
          This proceeding offers the advantage that the energy is
          concentrated into a very small space. Consequently one can
          show, after half an hour’s work, the production of relatively
          large quantities of uranium X.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The production of uranium X
          considerably in excess of that produced by spontaneous decay
          is to be explained only by the fact that, under the influence
          of the electric force, an acceleration of the radioactive
          transmutation of uranium takes place."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dr. Thomas H. Moray
          developed a method in the 1950s to enrich uranium by
          high-energy bombardment. He treated the ore (in a chemical
          solution) with x-rays (up to 24 MeV). The average ore
          contained 0.23% uranium oxide. After irradiation, the ore
          yielded from 7-75% uranium oxide! In 1953, Moray proposed that
          the Atomic Energy Commission investigate the "aging" of atomic
          ores by a "breeding type reaction with high-energy particles
          or x-rays in the presence of a proper environment". The AEC
          declined to grant a contract.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Perhaps fortunately, the
          technologies invented by Gaschler and Moray are dormant.
          Meanwhile, it is imperative that we develop every possible
          pathway to the deactivation of nuclear waste and weapons.</font>
