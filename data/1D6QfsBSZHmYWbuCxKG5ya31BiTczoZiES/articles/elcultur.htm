            application of electricity, magnetism, monochrome light, and
            sound can stimulate the growth of plants to a great extent.
            This little-known technology, called Electro-culture, can
            accelerate growth rates, increase yields, and improve crop
            quality. Electro-culture can protect plants from diseases,
            insects and frost. These methods also can reduce the
            requirements for fertilizer or pesticides. Farmers can grow
            bigger and better crops in less time, with less effort, and
            at a lower cost.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            several approaches to Electro-culture include: antennas,
            static electricity, direct and alternating current,
            magnetism, radio frequencies, monochrome and intermittent
            lighting, and sound. The energies are applied to the seeds,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">The
            French farmer Justin Christofloreau attracted attention in
            1925 with his apparatus to collect atmospheric energy for
            his crops. Clover treated by his method grew 7 feet high.
            Christofloreau's apparatus consisted of a 25-ft wooden pole;
            at the top was a metal pointer aligned north-south, and an
            antenna. Copper and zinc strips were soldered together to
            generate electricity from solar heat. Several of the poles
            were set about 10 ft apart, and the wires leading from them
            extended about 1000 yards. Christofloreau claimed that the
            accumulated electricity destroyed parasites and promoted
            beneficial chemical processes in the soil.<b>(2)</b></font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            1924, Georges Lakhovsky devised his Oscillator Circuit, a
            one-turn copper coil with overlapping ends separated by a
            gap. Capacitance generates oscillating currents that benefit
            the plants. The ring is supported by an insulator such as a
            plastic rod. This extremely simple arrangement stimulates
            plant growth (<b>Fig. 5.1</b>). <b>(3)</b></font></font> </p>

            clockwise in the Southern), when stuck in the ground about 1
            ft north of a plant, will collect atmospheric electricity.
            Connect a wire from the fence to a metal rod near the
            plants. A tv antenna also can be used. Rebar can be sunk
            into the ground at each end of a row of plants, connected by
            a bare wire under the soil and/or in the air. A north-south

study





            of the effects of electricity on plant growth began in 1746,
            when Dr. Maimbray of Edinburg treated myrtle plants with the
            output of an electrostatic generator, thereby enhancing
            their growth and flowering. Two years later, the French
            abbot Jean Nolet found that plants respond with accelerated
            rates of germination and overall growth when cultivated
            under charged electrodes.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Beginning
in
1885,





            the Finnish scientist Selim Laemstrom experimented with an
            aerial system powered by a Wimhurst generator and Leyden
            jars. He found that the electrical discharge from wire
            points stimulated the growth of crops such as potatoes,
            carrots, and celery for an average increase of about 40% (up
            to 70%) within 8 weeks. Greenhouse-grown strawberry plants
            produced ripe fruit in half the usual time. The yield of
            raspberries was increased by 95%, and the yield of carrots
            was increased by 125%. However, crops of cabbage, turnips,
            and flax grew better <u>without</u> electrification than
            with it. The Laemstrom system comprises a horizontal antenna
            suspended high enough to permit plowing, weeding and
            irrigation. The voltage applied to the antenna varies from 2
            to 70 KV, depending on the height of the antenna. The
            current is about 11 amps. <b>(4, 5)</b></font></font> </p>

            obtained similar results a few years later, and so did the
            Swiss priest J.J. Gasner in 1909. Also that year, Prof. G.
            Stone showed that a few sparks of static electricity
            discharged into the soil each day increased soil bacteria up
            to 600%.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            the 1920s, V.H. Blackman reported his experiments with an
            aerial system similar to that of Laemstrom. He applied 60
            volts DC/1 milliamp through 3 steel wires each 32 ft long
            and suspended 6 ft apart and 7 ft high on poles. This
            arrangement yielded an average increase of about 50% for
            several plant types. <b>(6)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">In
            1898, Grandeau and Leclerq studied the effect of atmospheric
            electricity on plants by covering part of a field with a
            wire net which shielded them from natural electrical action.
            The uncovered plants grew 50-60% better than the shielded
            plants.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Wet
            soil improves current flow. Electro-cultured plants require
            about 10% more water than control plants because the charged
            water is perspired more rapidly than under normal
            conditions. Positive results are always obtained except when
            ozone is formed by ionization. Negative aero-ions intensify
            cellular oxidation reduction processes, while the positives
            depress them.</font></font> </p>

            the 1840s, W. Ross of New York reportedly obtained a
            severalfold increase in the yield of a field of potatoes
            when he buried a copper plate (5 ft x 14 ft) in the earth,
            and a zinc plate of the same dimensions 200 ft away. The two
            plates were connected by a wire above ground, thus forming a
            galvanic cell. In similar experiments by Holdenfleiss (1844)
            with battery-charged zinc and copper plates, yields
            increased up to 25%.<b>(7)</b></font></font> </p>

            system to treat their grain in an electrified solution of
            nutrients. The grain was dried before sowing. The farmers
            cultivated about 2,000 acres with the seed. The results were
            reported in <i>Scientific American</i> (15 February 1919):</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"In
            the first place, there is a notable increase in the yield of
            grain from electrified seed... the yield of the electrified
            seed exceeds that of the unelectrified by from 4 to 16
            bushels... The average... is between 25 and 30 % of
            increase... The increase in weight has ranged from 1 pound
            to as much as 4 pounds per bushel... Besides the increase in
            the bulk of the yield and the increase in the weight per
            bushel, there is an increase in the straw... whereas the
            bulk of the unelectrified seeds had thrown up only 2 straws
            per seed, the electrified had thrown up 5.... The straw
            growing from the electrified seed is longer... The stoutness
            and the strength of the straw is increased... the crop is
            less likely to be laid by storms... Corn growing from seed
            thus treated is less susceptible to the attacks of fungus
            diseases and wireworm.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">"The
            effect produced upon the seed is not&nbsp; permanent; it
            will retain its enhanced efficiency only for about a month
            after electrification, if kept in a dry place. It is
            therefore desirable that the seed be sown promptly after it
            has been electrified... The grain must be steeped in water
            that contains in solution some salt [sodium nitrite] that
            will act as a conductor... The seed is steeped in it, and a
            weak current of electricity is passed by means of [iron]
            electrodes of large surface attached to two opposite end
            walls of the tank. The seed is then taken out and dried.</font></font>

            to be sown on one kind of soil will yield better results
            with a calcium salt, and seed that is to be sown on another
            kind of soil will yield better results with a sodium or
            other salt. One kind of seed will need treatment for so many
            hours, and another kind for many hours more or fewer.
            Barley, for instance, needs twice as long treatment as wheat
            or oats. The strength of the solution and the strength of
            the current must be appropriate, and are not necessarily the
            same in each case. The drying is very important. The seed
            must be dried at the right temperature, neither too rapidly
            nor too slowly; and it must be dried to the right degree,
            neither too much or too little." <b>(8, 9)</b></font></font>

            Stimulation with 60 volts DC substantially increased leaf

            trees with scaly bark. An electrode was inserted into the
            living cambium and phloem layers of the tree and the current
            passed into the branches, roots or soil. The treatment is
            best administered in the spring. The length of treatment
            depends on the size and condition of the tree. New shoots
            appeared after only one cycle of treatment. After the bark
            was removed, the trees began to bear fruit! The period of
            grafting stratification also can be shortened in this way.</font></font>

            increases. Both alternating and direct electric currents
            have a bacterial action which also affects the soil

            using AC, great care must be taken to prevent electrocution
            of oneself and the plants. AC generally tends to retard
            plant growth except within certain narrow parameters of
            voltage and amperage. Dicotyledon plants increase in weight
            at 10 KV and 100 KV, but decrease in weight (as much as 45%)
            between 20 to 60 KV. Current must be very low, or plant
            growth will be retarded.</font></font> </p>

            Murr used aluminum wire mesh electrodes charged up to 60 KV,
            and found that monocotyledons increase in dry weight in an
            electrostatic (ES) field, but decrease in weight in an
            oscillating field. The dry weight of dicots increases about
            20% when grown in an oscillating field, but decreases above
            50 KV. The concentration of minor elements (Fe, Zn, Al)
            increases several hundred percent in active leaf tips, due
            to an increase in oligo-enzymes. The activity of these
            substances is accelerated so much that cellular respiration
            is impeded, resulting in deterioration and death. There
            appears to be no benefit from continual exposure of plants
            to an alternating electrical field. If such a system is
            used, voltages should not exceed 10 KV, and the current must

            supplied was 50 watts (50 KV/1 mA) per acre for 6 hours
            daily for 6 months. The total energy supplied was less than
            0.2% of the energy actually absorbed by the plants from
            sunlight alone. Only a fraction of this additional energy
            was available to the plants, yet the increase averaged above
            20%, up to 50%! Furthermore, it was found that an electrical

            The increase in yield was smaller for plants whose seeds

            influence the fertilization process: the setting rate of
            fruit has been increased during hybridization of varieties

bacteria,





            fungi and insects can be destroyed without injuring the
            seeds, by application of high-frequency ES fields between
            capacitor plates. Pests are destroyed when a lethal degree
            of heat is developed within a few seconds. A longer exposure
            is required to cause decreased germination of seeds than is
            necessary to kill pests. <b>(19, 20)</b></font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">By
            this same method, it is possible to increase the power of
            germination of old seeds or seeds which are naturally
            difficult to germinate. Starch is increased, invert sugar is
            increased, and albumin is changed by such treatment. A
            greater percentage of treated seeds sprout sooner than
            untreated seeds. High-frequency ES fields also can be used
            either to inactivate or enhance enzymatic metabolism of
            fruits and vegetables, thus prolonging their stability, or
            hastening their ripening. In an ES field of 36 KV/m, the
            negative pole positioned above the seeds enhances their
            germination. The positive pole above the seeds inhibits
            germination. In the 1930s, V. Lebedev used very low power
            ultrashort waves to irradiate seeds, resulting in 20-45%
            accelerated plant growth. Similar results were obtained with
            potato tubers, and gladiolus bulbs were grown without cold
            pre-treatment.</font></font> </p>

            effects are thought to be caused by conduction currents or
            dipole antenna resonance. The lethal effect begins at about
            10.4 meters wavelength (29 MHz) when the condensor plates
            are 2-3 cm apart. Other researchers have reported similar
            effects with the following parameters: Plates, 12 cm diam.;
            Current, 5.5 amps; Wavelength, 5.6 meters (50 MHz);
            Temperature, 30-40<sup>o</sup> C. The lethal effects depend
            on the wavelength and the voltage gradient of the field
            strength (the distance between the condensor plates).
            Increasing either the frequency or the field strength while
            other factors remain constant increases the speed of the
            effect on pests. An increase of either factor requires more
            current, yet at certain frequencies (around 3 MHz), much
            less current is required for effective results (about 4 KV
            per linear inch). The higher the frequency, the shorter the
            lethal time. The thickness of the seeds and their moisture
            content also changes a lethal dose. The temperature of the
            seeds and pests may rise up to 60<sup>o</sup> C. A similar
            method was&nbsp; developed to destroy termites in wood,

            the dark period. The minimum dark period is about 0.03 at 25<sup>o</sup>
            C. The light reaction begins with about 0.001 second/flash,
            and it depends on the concentration of carbon dioxide.</font></font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">A.
            Shakhov, <i>et al</i>., developed several methods of
            applying Concentrated Pulsed Sunlight (CPSL) to stimulate
            the photoenergetic activity of seeds and plants. The flashes
            of CPSL last from 0.2 to 1 second and produce significant
            effects on physiological processes and increase plant
            productivity. The CPSL effect is not caused by the thermal
            action of concentrated light, but by endowing plants with a
            "photoenergy reserve" that increases yields of vegetable
            crops by 20-30%, and grain crops by 5-10%.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Arrays
of





            aluminum and glass dishes are used to concentrate sunlight
            up to 100 times. The apparatus is shaken lightly by various
            means to pulse the irradiation as it is directed on seeds or
            plants. In one such device, a large semi-conical aluminum
            reflector is rotated by a motor at 100-130 rpm. The seeds
            arrange themselves in a single layer on the wall of the pan
            and receive intermittent irradiation as they pass through a
            fixed focal spot on the inside wall. Artificial lighting
            (70,000 lux) pulsed 120 flashes/min. was found to produce
            effects even though the light energy was much lower than
            that of CPSL. With duckweed, maximum growth was obtained
            with a pulse period of 0.004 second.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Another
system
uses





            tinted mirrors to produce single colors. S.A. Stanko
            irradiated soy plants with pulsed red light for 30 min/day
            for a week, resulting in a 8% increase in the protein
            content of the beans.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Thomas
G.





            Hieronymous discovered that a plant can be grown in complete
            darkness indoors if it is connected by an insulated wire to
            a large metal surface that is exposed to sunlight. The plant
            must be at least 6 feet above ground and insulated to
            generate a voltage potential or antenna effect. The optimal
            size of the metal sheet must be determined by experiment so
            as to avoid sunburn (too large) or yellowing (too small).
            Plants cultivated in this manner will develop normally,
            while control plants will be stunted.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="-0">Dr.
            Wilhelm Reich (of Orgone fame) also found that plants could
            be grown without light if they were grown with magnetite
            that had been exposed to sunlight. The magnetite absorbs and
            reradiates solar energies that are utilized by plants.</font></font>
